However, conducting analytical quantification of adsorption coefficient (Kd) in large‐scale studies is too costly; therefore, a research question arises on goodness of Kd spatial prediction from sampling. The application of a spatial Bayesian regression (BR) is a newer technique in agricultural and natural resources sciences that allows converting spatially discrete samples into maps covering continuous spatial domains. The objective of this work was to unveil herbicide sorption to soil at a landscape scale by developing a predictive BR model. We integrated a large set of ancillary soil and climate covariables from sites with Kd measurements into a spatial mixed model including site random effects. The models were fitted using glyphosate and atrazine Kds, determined in 80 and 120 sites, respectively, from central Argentina. For model assessment, measurements of global and point‐wise prediction errors were obtained by cross‐validation; residual variability was estimated by bootstrap to compare BR with regression kriging. Results showed that the BR spatial predictions outperformed regression kriging. The glyphosate Kd model (root mean square prediction error, 13% of the mean) included aluminum oxides, pH, and clay content, whereas the atrazine Kd model strongly depended on soil organic carbon and clay and on climatic variables related to water availability (root mean square prediction error, 27%). Spatial modeling of a complex edaphic process as herbicide sorption to soils enhanced environmental interpretations. An efficient approach for spatial mapping provides a modern perspective on the study of herbicide sorption to soil.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBayesian theory 3aadsorption 3aaluminum 3aatrazine 3aclay 3aclay fraction 3aenvironmental quality 3aglyphosate 3akriging 3alandscapes 3apH 3aprediction 3arisk assessment 3asoil organic carbon 3astatistical models 3aArgentina1 aHang, Susana1 aRampoldi, Ariel E.1 aPaccioretti, Pablo1 aBalzarini, Mónica0 tJournal of environmental quality.g2021 July, v. 50, no. 4 p.934-944dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl1642x0047-24257nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jeq2.202543Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01901naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002200151245016700173300001400340520093300354592002801287650001201315650001001327650001201337651001501349651001501364700002101379773008201400856008501482990002301567852000901590655001201599IND60096278920221120043134.0141104e201306  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009627892DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cretres.2013.02.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVitek, Natasha S.10aSoft-shelled turtles (Trionychidae) from the Bissekty Formation (Upper Cretaceous: Turonian) of Uzbekistan: Skull-based taxa and probable skull-shell associations  ap. 48-58.  aIn this paper we describe previously unpublished trionychid turtle material, consisting of skull fragments, from the Late Cretaceous (late Turonian) Bissekty Formation of the Dzharakuduk locality in Uzbekistan. This material is assigned to two taxa: the skull-based Khunnuchelys kizylkumensisBrinkman et al. (1993, Can. J. Earth Sci. 30, 2214-2223) and Trionychini indet. Two specimens which cannot be confidently attributed to these two taxa are considered Trionychidae indet. In addition to these trionychid taxa known from skulls, the Dzharakuduk turtle assemblage includes at least two shell-based taxa, Aspideretoides cf. A. riabinini and “Trionyx” cf. “T.” kansaiensis. For this and other Late Cretaceous localities of Middle Asia and Kazakhstan, we suggest the probable skull-shell associations of Khunnuchelys spp. with “Trionyx” kansaiensis-like forms and Trionychini indet. with Aspideretoides-like forms.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTrionyx 3askull 3aturtles 3aKazakhstan 3aUzbekistan1 aDanilov, Igor G.0 tCretaceous research.g2013 June, v. 43 p.48-58dElsevier Ltdx0195-66717nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cretres.2013.02.0093Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03332naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001300150245015600163300001400319520181900333592002802152650002702180650001502207650002902222650001902251650001202270650001002282650001902292650001702311650001802328650002002346650002002366653002002386653002702406653002602433653001802459653002202477700001602499700001602515700006602531700002102597700001602618700001502634700001502649773008102664856008402745852000902829655001202838IND60561763220221116180243.0170713e20170401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056176322DNAL7 a10.1016/j.watres.2017.01.0332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Bin10aMicrocystis aeruginosa-laden surface water treatment using ultrafiltration: Membrane fouling, cell integrity and extracellular organic matter rejection  ap. 83-92.  aDespite its superb separation performance, ultrafiltration (UF) still faces challenges in treating the Microcystis aeruginosa-laden water of lakes or reservoirs, due to membrane fouling and poor rejection of soluble organics. In this work, to better understand the mechanisms of membrane fouling, cell breakage and organic rejection and their mutual influence, a comparative UF experiment was conducted under a variety of transmembrane pressures (TMPs, 50–250 kPa) with lab-cultured Microcystis aeruginosa. Membrane fouling was characterized with respect to flux decline and fouling reversibility, and cell breakage during UF filtration was evaluated using a flow cytometer. Moreover, the rejection of extracellular organic matter (EOM) by UF was investigated with respect to the dissolved organic carbon (DOC), ultraviolet absorbance at 254 nm (UV254) and microcystin-LR (MCLR). The results indicated that the accumulation of Microcystis cells and EOM on the membrane surface caused serious reversible fouling that substantially aggravated with the increasing TMP and was successively governed by pore blocking and cake filtration. The cell breakage during filtration was less than 5% and mainly occurred in the cake layer due to hydraulic shear, but the breakage did not substantially vary with increasing TMP. EOM removal by UF ranged from 40% to 70% (in terms of DOC removal), and the removal performance increased with the reversible resistance, implying a trade-off between organic removal and permeability. Regarding soluble and small organics such as MCLR, a higher degree of removal was also found at higher TMP, despite of some variations over the duration of the filtration tests, and the cake layer retention proved to be the principle removal mechanism, especially during steady filtration stages.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMicrocystis aeruginosa 3aabsorbance 3adissolved organic carbon 3aflow cytometry 3afouling 3alakes 3amicrocystin-LR 3apermeability 3asurface water 3aultrafiltration 3awater treatment 0aUltrafiltration 0aMicrocystis aeruginosa 0aFouling reversibility 0aCell breakage 0aOrganic rejection1 aQu, Fangshu1 aLiang, Heng1 aBruggen, Bart van der,1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3921-74721 aCheng, Xiaoxiang1 aYu, Huarong1 aXu, Guoren1 aLi, Guibai0 tWater research.g2017 Apr. 01, v. 112 p.83-92dElsevier Ltdx0043-13547nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2017.01.0333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02389naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003600111040001800147100002200165245008200187300001600269500001500285520089900300592002801199650002601227650001101253650001501264650001301279650001001292650002601302650001301328650002001341650002501361650002501386650005401411650001401465650004001479650002501519650002601544650002301570650004301593653002501636700003001661700002401691773010101715856008201816852000901898655001201907IND4475975020221116174701.0141111e201106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447597502DNAL7 a214588792pmid7 a10.1016/j.tree.2011.03.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTaylor, Nick G.H.10aAquatic systems: maintaining, mixing and mobilising antimicrobial resistance?  ap. 278-284.  a2019-12-06  aBacteria showing antimicrobial resistance (AMR) pose a significant global healthcare problem. Although many mechanisms conferring AMR are understood, the ecological processes facilitating its persistence and spread are less well characterised. Aquatic systems represent an important milieu for the environmental release, mixing, persistence and spread of AMR bacteria and resistance genes associated with horizontally transferable genetic elements. Additionally, owing to the use and discharge of antimicrobials and biocides, and the accumulation and abundance of other pollutants, mechanisms that confer AMR might evolve in aquatic systems. In this review, we hypothesise that aquatic systems have an important ecological and evolutionary role in driving the persistence, emergence and spread of AMR, which could have consequences when attempting to reduce its occurrence in clinical settings.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantibiotic resistance 3amixing 3apollutants 3abiocides 3agenes 3aanti-infective agents 3abacteria 3ahealth services 2aBacteriaxmetabolism 2aBiological Evolution 2aDrug Resistance, Microbialxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aEcosystem 2aGene Transfer, Horizontalxgenetics 2aGenes, MDRxgenetics 2aHydrobiologyxmethods 2aWater Microbiology 2aWater Pollutants, Chemicalxmetabolism 0aantimicrobial agents1 aVerner-Jeffreys, David W.1 aBaker-Austin, Craig0 tTrends in ecology & evolution.g2011 June, v. 26, no. 6 p.278-284dElsevier Ltdx0169-53477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tree.2011.03.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02604naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100001800188245005600206300001600262506007600278520116800354592002801522506003701550650002301587650001401610650001601624650001801640650001901658650002601677650000901703650003801712650001001750650002101760650001601781650003901797650001301836700002201849700001601871700001901887700001901906773011801925856008202043852000902125655001202134IND60440584120221207105614.0190319e201509  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6044058412DNAL7 a10.1007/s12639-013-0379-12doi7 aPMC45545552pmcid7 a263450562pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShalaby, Said10aDiagnotic value of some Fasciola gigantica antigens  ap. 479-486.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe present study was aimed to select the specificity of antigens for Fasciola gigantica depending on its diagnostic utility and field applications. The tested antigens were coproantigen, excretory–secretory (ES) antigen and egg antigen. Coproantigen and Copro Hyperimmune serum were able to reflect the lowest level of cross-reaction with other tested F. gigantica antigens. By using SDS-PAGE, a structural homology was observed in F. gigantica ES and egg antigens. Intense cross reaction was observed between ES and egg antigens by ELISA technique even when there was no cross-reaction with coproantigen. The 27.6 kDa band proved to be the most specific in F. gigantica coproantigen and was different from the band at the same molecular weight by ES antigen. The results conclude that coproantigens show specific diagnostic ability for Fasciola and have low numbers of cross-reaction proteins reflecting its high specificity. Moreover, detection of coproantigen in faeces offers a new potential for diagnostics as compared to serum samples. This fact holds promise for a more accurate diagnostic technique in the near future for suspected Fasciola infection.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aFasciola gigantica 3aantiserum 3ablood serum 3acoproantigens 3across reaction 3adiagnostic techniques 3aeggs 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3afeces 3amolecular weight 3aparasitoses 3apolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 3aproteins1 aEl-Bahy, Mohammad1 aHassan, Ali1 aShalaby, Hatem1 aGupta, Neelima0 tJournal of parasitic diseases.g2015 Sept., v. 39, no. 3 p.479-486dSpringer IndiawJournal:6190x0971-71967nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12639-013-0379-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01810naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245010600165300001600271520086300287592002801150650001501178650001201193650002501205700001701230700002001247700003201267773009601299856008101395990002301476852000901499655001201508IND60093433320221118200153.0141103e20120820xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009343332DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ces.2012.05.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChilin, David10aFault detection and isolation and fault tolerant control of a catalytic alkylation of benzene process  ap. 155-166.  aIn this work, we focus on the application of an integrated fault detection and isolation and fault tolerant control (FDIFTC) framework to a catalytic alkylation of benzene process. We consider that the catalytic alkylation of benzene process is controlled by a distributed model predictive control (DMPC) system and is subjected to unknown, persistent actuator faults. The FDIFTC system monitors closed-loop process residuals in order to detect and isolate a faulty actuator. After isolation of an actuator fault, the FDIFTC system estimates the fault magnitude, recalculates a new optimal operating point, and ultimately reconfigures the DMPC system to maintain stability of the process in an optimal manner. Extensive simulations are carried out to demonstrate the performance of the FDIFTC system from closed-loop stability and performance points of view.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalkylation 3abenzene 3achemical engineering1 aLiu, Jinfeng1 aChen, Xianzhong1 aChristofides, Panagiotis D.0 tChemical engineering science.g2012 Aug. 20, v. 78 p.155-166dElsevier Ltdx0009-25097nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ces.2012.05.0153Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02750naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002200146245009200168300001600260520125300276592002801529596011901557650001901676650001901695650002401714650001701738650002301755650001101778650002601789650001201815650002901827650002101856650002201877650002901899650002701928653002601955653001701981653001001998653003402008700006102042773011202103856008002215852000902295655001202304IND60645711520221119162505.0190529e201906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064571152DNAL7 a10.1177/0958305X188135962doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aObradović, Saša10aDoes environmental quality reflect on national competitiveness? The evidence from EU-15  ap. 559-585.  aThe European Union has set the target that by 2020 harmful emissions and energy consumption should be reduced by 20% compared to the 1990s. This paper examines the impacts of environmental quality on two parameters of national competitiveness (exports and GDP per capita). The study focuses on the EU-15 countries and covers the period from 1960 to 2013. Even though the analyzed economies are developed countries which are the leaders in environment protection, they are still also the leading emitters of greenhouse gases. The paper uses traditional econometric techniques to test the relations between energy use, CO₂ emissions, exports and GDP. The results show that the variables are co-integrated. In addition, energy-led growth hypothesis is valid in most of the analyzed economies. The results have also shown that increased CO₂ emissions reduce economic activity and export performance. Finally, we will conclude that there are two tasks for future policy makers: first, to strengthen renewable-energy goals, and second, to adjust the economic structure towards less harmful emissions. In such circumstances, we could expect the economies to further develop clean technologies and to obtain their benefits for national competitiveness.  aPublisher supplied data  a179015cMinistarstvo Prosvete, Nauke i Tehnološkog Razvojadhttps://doi.org/https://doi.org/10.13039/501100004564 3aEuropean Union 3acarbon dioxide 3adeveloped countries 3aeconometrics 3aeconomic structure 3aenergy 3aenvironmental quality 3aexports 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3agreenhouse gases 3aissues and policy 3arenewable energy sources 3asustainable technology 0aEnvironmental quality 0areal economy 0aEU-15 0avector error correction model1 aLojanica, Nemanja1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1460-84660 tEnergy & environment.g2019 June, v. 30, no. 4 p.559-585dSAGE PublicationswJournal:26865x2048-40707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0958305X188135963Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02288naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100001900188245008200207300001600289506007600305520076700381592002801148506003701176650002401213650000901237650002401246650001101270650001701281650001901298650001601317650001001333650001001343650001601353650001101369650001501380650001301395650001401408650002401422650000901446650001101455650001701466700001501483700001801498700001401516700001901530773011801549856008201667852000901749655001201758IND60440584220221207105600.0190319e201509  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6044058422DNAL7 a10.1007/s12639-013-0384-42doi7 aPMC45545892pmcid7 a263450592pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJaswal, Hitesh10aPathological observations on clinical Anaplasma marginale infection in cattle  ap. 495-498.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aGross and histopathological changes were recorded in a pregnant cattle died of clinical anaplasmosis, a tick transmitted economically important disease caused by Anaplasma marginale.

Results indicated that the testis and vas deferens underwent correlative changes in accord with the active, inactive and revival phases of spermatogenesis. The spermatogenic activity was at its peak during June evinced from large fully extended acini with full package of mature spermatozoa and low during September–February with decreased acinar dimensions, pycnotic germ cells and residual sperms. Seasonal cyclicity was also observed in the thickness of epithelium, muscle layer, diameter of lumen and the amount of luminal contents of the vas deferens. In June, the anterior and middle vas deferenswere filled with secretions and spermatophores.By September, ruptured spermatophores with freely dispersed pycnotic spermatozoa were perceptible in the anterior and middle vas deferens and lysed spermatophoric debris in posterior vas deferens.  aThe financial support provided by the University Grants Commission in the form of Junior Research Fellowship for the first author (order No. 20/12/2015(ii) EU-V dated 25 October 2016) is thankfully acknowledged.  aPublisher supplied data  a20/12/2015(ii) EU-V dated 25 October 2016cUniversity Grants Commissiondhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001501 3acrabs 3aepithelium 3amuscles 3aperiodicity 3asecretion 3aspermatogenesis 3aspermatophores 3aspermatozoa 3atestes 0aAnterior vas deferens 0afreshwater crab 0amiddle vas deferens 0aposterior vas deferens 0atestis1 aSudha Devi, Arath Raghavan0 tMarine and freshwater behaviour and physiology.g2019 Sept. 3, v. 52, no. 5 p.217-240dTaylor & FranciswJournal:12223x1029-03627nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10236244.2019.16774683Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01890naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100002400138245014700162300001800309520080300327592002801130650001301158650002401171650002201195650001401217650001401231650001201245650001101257650002101268650001901289700001801308773014501326856007201471852000901543655001201552IND60661894120221122033050.0190904e20051123xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066189412DNAL7 a10.1039/b511453e2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFilella, Montserrat10aCritical appraisal of available thermodynamic data for the complexation of antimony(iii) and antimony(v) by low molecular mass organic ligands  ap. 1226-1237.  aAntimony is an element of increasing environmental significance but one whose chemical speciation has received little attention and, until recently, one which had not been modelled in any comprehensive way.

The available data have been critically evaluated and entered into a thermodynamic database. The JESS suite of computer programs has been used to develop the thermodynamically-consistent mass balance equations used for modelling purposes.

A total of 248 cyst lesions in the masseter muscle of 28 naturally infected pigs were examined 1, 4 and 8 weeks after oxfendazole (OFZ) treatment. As controls, half of the pigs received no treatment. Lesions were graded 0–V according to their inflammatory response, based on viability of the parasite, the degree and type of cellular response as well as deposition of collagen. Comparison of the degree of inflammatory response was made between treated and un-treated groups showing a significant difference in the mean grade of inflammatory response between 1 and 8 weeks after OFZ treatment. The OFZ treated pigs were further divided into 4 cyst intensity groups. The group with the highest cyst intensity had the lowest mean grade of inflammatory response and the group with the lowest cyst intensity had the highest mean grade of inflammatory response. Thus the present study supports the hypothesis that the time needed for the body to clear the cysts depends on the cyst intensity of individual pigs at the time of treatment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTaenia solium 3acollagen 3acysticercosis 3amuscle tissues 3amuscles 3aoxfendazole 3aparasites 3aswine 3aviability 2aAnimals 2aAnthelminticsxtherapeutic use 2aBenzimidazolesxtherapeutic use 2aCysticercosisxdrug therapyxpathologyxveterinary. 2aMuscle, Skeletalxpathology 2aSwine 2aSwine Diseasesxdrug therapyxparasitology. 2aTaenia solium1 aKarlsson, Madeleine1 aSpång, Frederic1 aSikasunge, Chummy Sikalizyo1 aJohansen, Maria Vang0 tVeterinary parasitology.g2012 Dec. 21, v. 190, no. 3-4 p.442-446dElsevier B.V.x0304-40177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetpar.2012.07.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04231naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094024002200130024001900152040001800171100002100189245017100210300001600381506007600397520230200473592002802775506003702803650002202840650004702862650001202909650001002921650001902931650002002950650001202970650001902982650002703001650001803028650001203046650001003058650001403068650001503082650001603097650001503113650002403128650001203152650001003164650002203174651001003196653001703206653002503223653001703248653001903265653001403284700001803298700002303316700001603339700002203355773013703377856008203514852000903596655001203605IND60555231220221207080127.0161026e201404  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055523122DNAL7 a10.12980/APJTB.4.2014C10932doi7 aPMC39297962pmcid7 a251825572pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAïzoun, Nazaire10aComparative susceptibility to permethrin of two Anopheles gambiae s.l. populations from Southern Benin, regarding mosquito sex, physiological status, and mosquito age  ap. 312-317.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aTo investigate what kind of mosquito sample is necessary for the determination of insecticide susceptibility in malaria vectors.Larvae and pupae of Anopheles gambiae s.l. (An. gambiae) mosquitoes were collected from the breeding sites in Littoral and Oueme departments. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) susceptibility tests were conducted on unfed male and female mosquitoes aged 2-5 days old. CDC susceptibility tests were also conducted on unfed, blood fed and gravid female mosquitoes aged 2-5 days old. These susceptibility tests were also conducted on unfed and blood fed female mosquitoes aged 2-5 days old and 20 days old. CDC biochemical assay using synergist was also carried out to detect any increase in the activity of enzyme typically involved in insecticide metabolism.Female An. gambiae Ladji and Sekandji populations were more susceptible than the males when they were unfed and aged 2-5 days old. The mortality rates of blood fed female An. gambiae Ladji and Sekandji populations aged 2-5 days old were lower than those obtained when females were unfed. In addition, the mortality rates of gravid female An. gambiae Ladji and Sekandji populations aged 2-5 days old were lower than those obtained when they were unfed. The mortality rate obtained when female An. gambiae Sekandji populations were unfed and aged 20 days old was higher than the one obtained when these populations were unfed and aged 2-5 days old. The results obtained after effects of synergist penicillin in beeswax on F1 progeny of An. gambiae Ladji populations resistant to permethrin showed that mono-oxygenases were involved in permethrin resistant F1 progeny from Ladji.The resistance is a hereditary and dynamic phenomenon which can be due to metabolic mechanisms like overproduction of detoxifying enzymes activity. Many factors influence vector susceptibility to insecticide. Among these factors, there are mosquito sex, mosquito age, its physiological status. Therefore, it is useful to respect the World Health Organization criteria in the assessment of insecticide susceptibility tests in malaria vectors. Otherwise, susceptibility testing is conducted using unfed female mosquitoes aged 3-5 days old. Tests should also be carried out at (25±2) °C and (80±10)% relative humidity.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAnopheles gambiae 3aCenters for Disease Control and Prevention 3abeeswax 3ablood 3abreeding sites 3aenzyme activity 3afemales 3ainsect vectors 3ainsecticide resistance 3alittoral zone 3amalaria 3amales 3amortality 3aoxygenases 3apenicillins 3apermethrin 3aphysiological state 3aprogeny 3apupae 3arelative humidity 3aBenin 0aMosquito sex 0aPhysiological status 0aMosquito age 0aSusceptibility 0aSynergist1 aAïkpon, Rock1 aAzondekon, Roseric1 aAsidi, Alex1 aAkogbéto, Martin0 tAsian Pacific Journal of Tropical Biomedicine.g2014 Apr., v. 4 p.312-317dElsevier B.V.aHainan Medical Universityx2221-16917nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.12980/APJTB.4.2014C10933Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02335naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245012800168300001400296520107800310592002801388650001801416650001201434650001101446650001301457650001501470650001101485650002801496651002001524653002101544653002201565653001901587653001801606653002101624653002201645653001801667653002001685700001901705773009501724856008501819852000901904655001201913IND60524312820221117082338.0161112e20160402xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052431282DNAL7 a10.1080/00049158.2015.11233922doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJay, V. Alex10aModelling the outcomes of different silvicultural approaches in the private native forests of north-eastern New South Wales  ap. 85-95.  aPrivate native forests provide an important component of the log supply to local industry and a source of income for landowners in New South Wales (NSW). However, due to a history of high-grading, the estate in north-eastern NSW is in poor productive condition. In order to improve forest structure and productivity, various silvicultural techniques may be employed. In this study, the EUCAMIX forest model was used to compare three different silvicultural approaches and determine which provided the best silvicultural and economic outcome for mixed-species, mixed-age native forest stands in north-eastern NSW. The outcome for the entire estate in this area was also modelled. While high-grading leads to a long-term decline in forest values, it is a financially rational choice for landowners. Restorative silviculture produces better outcomes in the long term but the up-front costs and length of time to payback are likely to be a deterrent. Additional sources of revenue are therefore needed to incentivise landowners to engage in restorative silvicultural practices.  aPublisher supplied data 3aforest stands 3aforests 3aincome 3aindustry 3alandowners 3amodels 3asilvicultural practices 3aNew South Wales 0aForest resources 0aforest management 0anative forests 0afarm forestry 0aprivate forestry 0aselective felling 0agrowth models 0aNew South Wales1 aDillon, Alison0 tAustralian forestry.g2016 Apr. 2, v. 79, no. 2 p.85-95dTaylor & Francisx2325-60877nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00049158.2015.11233923Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02494naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002200151245006200173300001600235520138600251592002801637650002501665650001301690650001801703650003301721650001501754650000901769653001801778653001001796653001101806653002201817653001301839653001501852653001901867700003101886773009701917856008502014852000902099655001202108IND60524312920221117083107.0161112e20160402xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052431292DNAL7 a10.1080/00049158.2015.11248262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCheng, Kenneth J.12aA note on the surface topography of profiled wood decking  ap. 147-152.  aProfiled wooden deck-boards with small peaks and grooves machined into their surface are preferred in many countries to flat deck-boards because profiling makes the surface less slippery and prone to checking. Numerous companies manufacture profiled decking, and in this paper we examine the variation in topography of profiled wood decking. The topography of commercial profiled decking used in seven different countries was quantified using confocal profilometry, and principal components analysis was used to explore variability in topography between profiled decking samples and relationships between them. Confocal profilometry was able to measure the topography of profiled decking. We observed large variation in the height and width of profile peaks and also their peak and groove radii. Profiled decking can be classified into three morphological groups using the ratio of radii of surface grooves to those of peaks. Two of these groups, ribbed and rippled decking have been mentioned previously, but we identify and name a third group (ribble profile) with surface topography that lies between those of ribbed and rippled profiles. Our method of classifying profiles makes it possible to identify different types of profiled decking and provides a way of systematically comparing how profile topography influences the ability of profiles to restrict the checking of wood.  aPublisher supplied data 3abusiness enterprises 3aforestry 3amanufacturing 3aprincipal component analysis 3atopography 3awood 0aWood products 0adecks 0achecks 0asurface treatment 0aprofiles 0atopography 0aclassification1 aEvans, P.

To clarify whether these three potential receptors contribute to the resistance of lepidopteran insects to the Bt toxin, the transcription patterns of these genes in Cry1Acâsusceptible Plutella xylostella strains and strains highly resistant to Cry1Ac were examined using realâtime quantitative polymerase chain reactions. Both gene expressions of cadherin and APNs were most abundant in the midgut of fourth larval instars but were also found in pupae. The transcription levels of cadherin, APN2 and ALP genes in the midgut were more abundant in the susceptible strain than in the resistant strain and also clearly differed between the two strains. Moreover, the transcription levels of cadherin increased as the insect developed from the second to the fourth larval instars and then decreased in pupae. mRNA of the APN2 gene was more abundant than that of the APN1, APN3 and APN4 genes in the susceptible strain. The results suggested that these differences were attributable to the adaptation of the resistant strain to the Bt toxin and demonstrated a possible link between the gene expression of cadherin, ALP and APN2 and the resistance of P.Â xylostella to Bt. The information provided in the current study can be useful for the development of resistance management strategies.  aPublisher supplied data 3amessenger RNA 3amembrane alanyl aminopeptidase 3apupae 3apolymerase chain reaction 3amidgut 3ainstars 3atranscription (genetics) 3aPlutella xylostella 3agene expression 3aBacillus thuringiensis 3agenes 3atoxins 3alarvae 3areceptors 3aresistance management 3ainsects 3aalkaline phosphatase 0aproteins1 aWu, Q.âJ.1 aWang, S.âL.1 aChang, X.âL.1 aWang, J.âH.1 aGuo, Z.âJ.1 aLei, Y.âY.1 aXu, B.âY.1 aZhang, Y.âJ.0 tJournal of applied entomology.g2012 Aug., v. 136, no. 7 p.539-548dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0931-20487nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1439-0418.2011.01683.x  aDNAL 7aarticle02472naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245007900169300001200248520141300260592002801673650001401701650002301715650002501738650001801763650001101781650001101792650001301803650001701816650001601833700002401849700003101873773009301904856008101997990002302078852000902101655001202110IND60093433720221118195911.0141103e20120910xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009343372DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ces.2012.05.0202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYoosuk, Boonyawan10aUnsupported MoS₂ and CoMoS₂ catalysts for hydrodeoxygenation of phenol  ap. 1-7.  aThe structural properties and catalytic functionality of two different morphologies of unsupported MoS₂ catalysts were investigated systematically. Hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) of phenol was used as the model reaction to examine the effect of the catalyst structure on the hydrogenolysis and hydrogenation activity and selectivity. The unsupported MoS₂, with amorphous and highly bent multi-layer structures, was much more active than the highly crystalline structured MoS₂ and resulted in direct oxygen elimination. Co promoter showed a strong effect on the activity and selectivity of Mo sulfides. Temperature programmed reduction (TPR) exhibited the close interaction between Co and Mo in the bimetallic sulfide catalysts resulting in shift of TPR peaks to lower temperatures. The addition of promoter also affected the textural properties of amorphous Mo sulfide by decreasing the surface area, changing the pore characteristics and shifting the pore-size distribution towards smaller sizes. The growth of MoS₂ crystallized particles was inhibited when Co was incorporated. The enhanced catalytic activity observed with the promoter addition was essentially due to the enhancement of the rate of direct-deoxygenation route. The present study indicated that the activity and selectivity for phenol HDO can be controlled by tailoring the morphology and the promoter of the unsupported MoS₂ catalysts.  aPublisher supplied data 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3achemical engineering 3ahydrogenation 3aoxygen 3aphenol 3asulfides 3asurface area 3atemperature1 aTumnantong, Dusadee1 aPrasassarakich, Pattarapan0 tChemical engineering science.g2012 Sept. 10, v. 79 p.1-7dElsevier Ltdx0009-25097nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ces.2012.05.0203Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03234naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245009700172300001400269520214000283592002802423650001102451650001402462650002202476650001102498650001302509650001702522650001802539651001102557700002902568700002202597700002202619700002002641773008202661856008502743990002302828852000902851655001202860IND60096279620221119092925.0141104e201308  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009627962DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cretres.2013.03.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aProkoph, Andreas10aCenomanian–Turonian carbon isotope stratigraphy of the Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin  ap. 39-53.  aThe Cenomanian–Turonian boundary was characterized by distinctive positive carbon isotope excursions that were related to the formation of widespread oceanic anoxia. High-resolution geochemical proxies (TOC, CaCO₃, δ¹³Cₒᵣg, and δ¹³Ccₐᵣb) obtained from bulk rock, planktic foraminifers, and inoceramids from four marine marlstone-dominated stratigraphic sections in the Western Canada Sedimentary Basin (WCSB) were used to establish a regional carbon isotope stratigraphic framework and to investigate paleoenvironmental variability in four different depositional settings. Compared to background δ¹³Cₒᵣg, (<−27‰) and δ¹³Ccₐᵣb (<2‰) values which were correlative to stable isotope excursions during Oceanic Anoxic Event (OAE) II worldwide, the δ¹³Cₒᵣg (>24‰), and δ¹³Ccₐᵣb (>4‰) derived from inoceramid prisms in the studied sections within WCSB, were elevated during the Late Cenomanian–Early Turonian. During this interval, TOC and CaCO₃ values which increased sporadically to >40% and 7%, respectively, were not consistent enough to be used for stratigraphic correlations. Based on the δ¹³Cₒᵣg excursions, two bentonite beds were regionally correlated across this portion of the Western Interior Seaway (WIS). The eruption associated with the “Red” bentonite occurred approximately coeval with the maximum δ¹³Cₒᵣg-excursion during OAE II in the Neocardioceras juddii Zone, whereas the “Blue” bentonite coincides with the termination of OAE II in the latest Watinoceras devonense zone. During the Late Cenomanian–Early Turonian in the WCSB, benthic foraminifers were sparse or totally absent, indicating the existence of fully anoxic bottom-water conditions. Planktic foraminifera were common in the well-oxygenated surface waters. A benthic oxic zone characterized by several agglutinated species occurs in the eastern part of the WSCB at the beginning of OAE II in the Sciponoceras gracile zone. The termination of the OAE II in the WCSB coincides with the first occurrence of small ammonites (Subprionocyclus sp.) in the western part of the basin.  aPublisher supplied data 3abasins 3abentonite 3acalcium carbonate 3acarbon 3aisotopes 3astratigraphy 3asurface water 3aCanada1 aBabalola, Lameed Olabode1 aEl Bilali, Hafida1 aOlagoke, Sulaiman1 aRachold, Volker0 tCretaceous research.g2013 Aug., v. 44 p.39-53dElsevier Ltdx0195-66717nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cretres.2013.03.0053Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03504naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100002800188245009500216300001600311506007600327520191000403592002802313506003702341650002302378650001302401650002202414650001102436650001302447650001402460650001102474650001902485650000902504650003802513650001702551650001102568650001102579650002102590650000902611650003902620650001202659650000902671650001002680650001802690700002602708700003102734773011802765856008202883852000902965655001202974IND60440584720221207110441.0190319e201509  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6044058472DNAL7 a10.1007/s12639-013-0394-22doi7 aPMC45545862pmcid7 a263450692pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShaapan, Raafat Mohamed10aSignificance of a common 65 kDa antigen in the experimental fasciolosis and toxoplasmosis  ap. 550-556.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aIn the current study, cross-reaction between two important zoonotic parasites; extracellular helminthes Fasciola gigantica and intracellular protozoa Toxoplasma gondii was proved by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay. Five antigens were used to identify and compare the cross-binding activities in the prepared antisera. Two F. gigantica antigens; adult flukes (FgA) and eggs (FgEA) were used to detect IgG in T. gondii naturally infected human sera (TgIHS) and experimentally infected sera of sheep (TgISS), mice (TgIMS) and rats (TgIRS). Three types of T. gondii antigens; RH (TgRHA), local sheep isolate (TgLA) and ME49 isolate (TgMEA) were used to detect cross binding activities in F. gigantica experimental infected rabbit sera (FgIRS) and F. gigantica naturally infected bovine sera (FgIBS). The cross-binding activities in the prepared antisera were strongly directed towards FgA and TgLA rather than the other antigens. The characterization of the five antigens using SDS-PAGE showed 4 common bands of FgA and TgLA; 165, 97, 76, and 65 kDa. While two common bands were observed between TgRHA, TgMEA and FgA; 165, and 65 kDa. Whereas, two common bands found between three types of T. gondii antigens and FgEA were identified; 165 and 65 kDa. The immunogenic cross-reactive bands between FgA and TgLA with F. gigantica infected bovine sera were identified by immunoblot. In FgA, the common immunogenic bands were 165, 65 and 14 kDa. While in TgLA, common immunogenic bands were 165 and 65 kDa. Whereas, the common immunogenic band between FgA and TgLA identified with T. gondii experimentally infected sheep sera was 65 kDa. The current research proves cross reaction between F. gigantica and T. gondii. One common band of 65 kDa showed broad immunogenic cross-reactivity with the developed antisera raising the prospect of being putative common immunodiagnostic candidate of both infections.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aFasciola gigantica 3aProtozoa 3aToxoplasma gondii 3aadults 3aantigens 3aantiserum 3acattle 3across reaction 3aeggs 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3afascioliasis 3aflukes 3ahumans 3aimmunoglobulin G 3amice 3apolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 3arabbits 3arats 3asheep 3atoxoplasmosis1 aToaleb, Nagwa Ibrahim1 aAbdel-Rahman, Eman Hussein0 tJournal of parasitic diseases.g2015 Sept., v. 39, no. 3 p.550-556dSpringer IndiawJournal:6190x0971-71967nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12639-013-0394-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03920naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245012600171300001600297520201600313536026902329592002802598596005002626596007602676650003002752650001202782650001602794650002002810650001102830650002202841650001902863650001602882650001502898650002402913651001502937651001002952651001302962651001302975651001202988653001203000653002503012653004003037653003303077653001103110653002703121700002003148773014003168856008503308852000903393655001203402IND60675364120221116141714.0191106e20191002xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067536412DNAL7 a10.1080/15715124.2018.14763682doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSikder, Md. S.,10aImproving operational flood forecasting in monsoon climates with bias-corrected quantitative forecasting of precipitation  ap. 411-421.  aFor flood-prone countries subject to large-scale and seasonal flooding, precipitation forecasting is the single most important factor for improving the skill of flood forecasting for such large river basins dominated by the monsoon. Several flood forecasting agencies in South and Southeast Asia, where monsoon floods dominate (e.g. Bangladesh, Pakistan, India, Thailand and Vietnam), are currently using quantitative precipitation forecast (QPF) from numerical weather prediction (NWP) models. Although there are numerous studies reported in the literature to evaluate QPF precipitation performance, there appears to be lack of studies about the impact on the flood forecasting skill. In this study, we demonstrate tangible improvements in flood forecasting based on NWP precipitation forecast using an approach that is operationally feasible in resource-limited settings of many flood agencies. Our improvement is based on a bias correction methodology for enhancing the skill of QPF using observed and QPF climatology. The proposed approach can be applied to any type of QPF dataset such as those dynamically downscaled from regional NWP. We demonstrate clear and consistent improvement in the enhancement of flood forecasting skill at longer lead times of up to 7 days in three river basins of Ganges, Brahmaputra and Mekong by about 50% (reduction in RMSE) or 25% improvement in correlation when compared to the forecasts obtained from uncorrected QPF. Furthermore, our proposed bias correction methodology yields significantly higher skill improvement in flood forecast for global (non-downscaled) QPF than those dynamically downscaled QPFs for the macroscale hydrologic model used for forecasting stream flows. The simplicity of the QPF bias correction methodology along with the numerical efficiency can be of tremendous appeal to operational flood forecasting agencies of the developing world faced with large-scale monsoonal flooding and limited computational resources and time for disaster response.  aThe first author was supported by a NASA Earth and Science Fellowship grant (NNX16AO68H) and the NASA Applied Sciences Disasters Program.

Skeels grows in extreme ecological conditions. The aim of the present work is mapping the natural extension of the species in Tindouf (Algeria) and in the Western Sahara. Our work adopts cartographic processing by GIS (Geographic Information System). To delimit the natural distribution of the species in Tindouf in Algeria, we localized argan tree distribution by GPS (global positioning system) in 2008, 2009 and 2012. In this region, the Argan tree occupies dry river banks towards the western side of the Draa Hamada. It is found at an altitude that ranges between 254 and 634 m above sea level, spreading over a surface of 50,670 hectares. For remote areas in the south, we adopted a toponymical study in order to prove its existence in Western Sahara.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArgania spinosa 3aaltitude 3abiogeography 3ageographic information systems 3ageographical distribution 3aglobal positioning systems 3atrees 3aAlgeria 3aWestern Africa 0aArgan tree 0aCartography 0aToponymy 0aWestern Sahara 0aTindouf1 aAbdoun, Fatiha0 tInternational journal of environmental studies.g2016 Mar. 3, v. 73, no. 2 p.286-293dRoutledgex1029-04007nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00207233.2016.11484483Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03586naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100005300151245011800204520207500322592002802397650001102425650001902436650001602455650002202471650002202493650002402515650001002539650000902549650001602558650001902574650000902593650001902602650001602621650001902637650002102656650001502677653002302692653003202715653001702747653001302764653001802777653004002795700002802835700002902863773010502892856008602997852000903083655001203092IND60682202120221119105215.0200503e202004  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068220212DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhydrol.2020.1246152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPaz, Igor1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7233-351510aRain gauge networks’ limitations and the implications to hydrological modelling highlighted with a X-band radar  aPrecipitation risk and water management is a key challenge for densely populated urban areas. Applications derived from high spatio-temporal resolution observation of precipitations are to make our cities more weather-ready. Finer resolution data available from dual polarised X-band radar measurements enhance engineering tools as used for urban planning policies as well as protection (mitigation/adaptation) strategies to tackle climate-change related weather events. For decades engineering tools have been developed to work conveniently either with very local rain gauge networks, or with mainly C-band radars that have gradually been set up for space-time remote sensing of precipitation. Most of the time, the C-band radars continue to be calibrated by the existing rain gauge networks. Inhomogeneous distributions of these networks lead to only a partial information on the rainfall fields. Here we show that the statistics of measured rainfall is strongly biased by the fractality of the measuring networks and that this fractality needs to be properly taken into account to retrieve the original properties of the rainfall fields, in spite of the radar data calibration. In this work, we use the semi-distributed hydrological modelling over the Bièvre catchment to generate a virtual rain gauges’ network. And, firstly, performing a fractal analysis of this network distribution, we demonstrate that the semi-distributed hydrological models statistically reduce the distributed (weather radar) rainfall fields into rainfall measured by a much scarcer network of virtual rain gauges. Then, with the help of the Intersection Theorem and multifractal theory, we statistically compare the virtual rain gauges’ data with the rainfall data measured by the dual-polarimetric X-band radar operated at Ecole des Ponts with a spatial resolution of 250 m, providing pre-factors that indicate the need of a proper re-normalisation of rain gauge rainfall data when comparing (or calibrating) with radar data and the possible counter productivity of this conditioning.  aPublisher supplied data 3acities 3aclimate change 3aengineering 3ahydrologic models 3aissues and policy 3ameteorological data 3aradar 3arain 3arain gauges 3aremote sensing 3arisk 3aspace and time 3aurban areas 3aurban planning 3awater management 3awatersheds 0aRain gauge network 0aSpatio-temporal variability 0aX-band radar 0aFractals 0aMultifractals 0aSemi-distributed hydrological model1 aTchiguirinskaia, Ioulia1 aSchertzer, D.q(Daniel),0 tJournal of hydrology.g2020 Apr., v. 583 p.124615-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl46539x0022-16947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2020.1246153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04162naa a2200649 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002100148245014800169300001600317520212600333592002802459650003502487650002602522650000802548650001502556650001902571650001602590650001402606650001802620650002402638650001002662650002202672650003802694650001002732650002302742650001902765650001102784650002002795650002502815650003002840650001402870650003302884650001802917650002602935650003002961650004502991650001803036650002203054650001103076651001003087651001303097700001903110700002103129700001603150700001403166700002003180700002003200700005403220773013403274856008303408852000903491655001203500IND60704269620221118111338.0200820e202008  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070426962DNAL7 a10.1007/s10658-020-02003-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShreenath, Y. S.10aEvidence for the association of mastrevirus, cucumovirus and phytoplasma with chickpea stunt disease and their putative insect vectors in India  ap. 719-731.  aSymptoms of severe stunting, little leaf, yellowing and axillary shoot proliferation were recorded on chickpea plants in three northern states of India (New Delhi, Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan) during January–March, 2017–2018 with disease incidences of 6–56%. Nested PCR assays with phytoplasma-specific universal primer pairs (P1/P7 and 3Far/3Rev) and 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis confirmed the association of ‘Candidatus Phytoplasma trifolii’ in the symptomatic chickpea variety Pusa Bheema at New Delhi. The in silico RFLP and phylogeny analyses of 16S rRNA sequence of the chickpea stunt (CpS) affected samples confirmed the association of 16SrVI-D subgroup phytoplasma. Similar phytoplasma strain (16SrVI-D subgroup) was detected in the leafhopper species, Hishimonus phycitis collected from symptomatic chickpea fields at New Delhi. Association of icosahedral virus particles of ~25–30 nm diameters were seen under electron microscope in CpS affected samples as well as in the aphids, Myzus persicae (Sulzer) collected from the symptomatic CpS samples at New Delhi. Both the plant and aphid samples were tested positive with the polyclonal antibodies (pAbs) of cucumber mosaic virus (CMV) in DAS-ELISA and ISEM tests. PCR assays using coat protein (CP) gene specific primers for CMV and the resultant sequence comparison also confirmed the association of CMV with the CpS affected symptomatic chickpea plants and M. persicae. The CpS affected samples collected from all the three states were further tested positive with chickpea chlorotic dwarf virus (chickpea chlorotic dwarf virus, CpCDV) CP gene specific primers in PCR assays. The 2.7 kb DNA sequence resulted from the rolling circle amplification (RCA) from the CpS affected chickpea samples of New Delhi revealed a highest sequence similarity of 99% with the CpCDV isolate from Pakistan. These results suggested a wider occurrence of CpCDV in chickpea crops in all the three states and a mixed infection of phytoplasma [‘Ca. P. trifolii’ (16SrVI-D subgroup)] and two plant viruses (CMV and CpCDV) associated with CpS disease at New Delhi.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChickpea chlorotic dwarf virus 3aCucumber mosaic virus 3aDNA 3aHishimonus 3aMyzus persicae 3aPhytoplasma 3achickpeas 3acoat proteins 3acomputer simulation 3acrops 3adisease incidence 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3agenes 3agrowth retardation 3ainsect vectors 3aleaves 3amixed infection 3anucleotide sequences 3aoligodeoxyribonucleotides 3aphylogeny 3aplant diseases and disorders 3aplant viruses 3apolyclonal antibodies 3apolymerase chain reaction 3arestriction fragment length polymorphism 3aribosomal RNA 3asequence homology 3avirion 3aIndia 3aPakistan1 aSaritha, R.

V. cholerae, including both serogroups O1 and O139, is found in association with crustacean zooplankton, mainly copepods, and notably in ponds, rivers, and estuarine systems globally. The incidence of cholera and occurrence of pathogenic V. cholerae strains with zooplankton were studied in two areas of Bangladesh: Bakerganj and Mathbaria. Chitinous zooplankton communities of several bodies of water were analyzed in order to understand the interaction of the zooplankton population composition with the population dynamics of pathogenic V. cholerae and incidence of cholera. Two dominant zooplankton groups were found to be consistently associated with detection of V. cholerae and/or occurrence of cholera cases, namely, rotifers and cladocerans, in addition to copepods. Local differences indicate there are subtle ecological factors that can influence interactions between V. cholerae, its plankton hosts, and the incidence of cholera.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aCopepoda 3aVibrio cholerae 3aaquatic environment 3abacteria 3acholera 3adeveloping countries 3ahosts 3aponds 3apopulation dynamics 3arivers 3asurface water 3azooplankton 3aBangladesh1 aMozumder, Pronob K.1 aGrim, Christopher J.1 aHasan, Nur A.1 aNiamul Naser, M.,1 aAlam, Munirul1 aSack, R.

Moreover, it was indicated that water acted as a solvent, reactant, and proton donor by dissociation at an elevated temperature, which supplied slightly acidic conditions and promoted the rearrangement reaction.  aPublisher supplied data 3acatalysts 3acopper 3adissociation 3agreen chemistry 3ahydrogenation 3ahydroxymethylfurfural 3amoieties 3anickel 3asolvents 3atemperature1 aMa, Hong1 aSun, Yuxia1 aLuo, Yang1 aLiu, Xin1 aZhang, Meiyun1 aGao, Jin1 aXu, Jie0 tGreen chemistry.g2019 Apr. 1, v. 21, no. 7 p.1702-1709dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26906x1463-92707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c8gc04009e3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03206naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100005900139245014800198300001600346500002000362520161500382592002801997596001902025596002102044650002402065650001102089650001102100650001302111650001402124650001702138650002502155650001102180651001902191700002202210700002102232700002102253700001802274700002102292700002202313700002002335700001902355700001702374700002002391700002302411700005902434773012502493856007302618852000902691655001202700IND60746830420221120135433.0210806e202109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074683042DNAL7 a10.1111/fog.125382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIshikawa, Kazuo1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2659-498910aSpatiotemporal variability in the occurrence of juvenile Japanese jack mackerel Trachurus japonicus along coastal areas of the Kuroshio Current  ap. 569-583.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aTo understand the population structure of the Japanese jack mackerel Trachurus japonicus in coastal areas adjacent to the Kuroshio Current (referred to as the “CAK”), we analyzed size composition and commercial landing data of juvenile fish in these areas for the period 2005–2015. Trachurus japonicus does not undergo population‐scale spawning migration, and thus, the connectivity between the spawning and juvenile/adult habitat areas is important. Therefore, our primary aim was to assess the origin of juveniles landed in a number of subareas, including those spawned in local spawning grounds in January–May in the western part of the CAK (w‐CAK), those spawned in May–July in the eastern part (e‐CAK), and those spawned in February–March in the remote spawning ground in the southern East China Sea (s‐ECS). Fishing periods starting in spring (spring onset) were commonly observed in the CAK, which involved relatively small size classes (50–100 mm fork length [FL]). Back estimates based on the growth rate of T. japonicus suggested that the contributions from the s‐ECS probably dominated most of the spring onsets in April–June because the smallest size class (50–70 mm FL) occurred almost exclusively in April–May. In autumn, onset signals were associated with the landing of juveniles from the local spawning ground in an eastern subarea of the e‐CAK. Despite the asymmetric transport and migration flows between the habitat areas of T. japonicus, its population levels may be sustained because the local and remote spawning grounds are used in different seasons.  aPublisher supplied data  a20J14281cJSPS  cFisheries Agency 3aTrachurus japonicus 3aadults 3aautumn 3ahabitats 3ajuveniles 3aoceanography 3apopulation structure 3aspring 3aEast China Sea1 aWatanabe, Chikako1 aKameda, Takahiko1 aTokeshi, Tsutomu1 aHorie, Hikari1 aHashida, Daisuke1 aOokawa, Toshiyuki1 aTakeda, Takashi1 aKuno, Masahiro1 aSuzuki, Yuki1 aTakamura, Shozo1 aFukumoto, Ryousuke1 aItoh, Sachihiko1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5995-19250 tFisheries oceanography.g2021 Sept., v. 30, no. 5 p.569-583dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:J000000070x1054-60067nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/fog.125383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02658naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245002900171300001600200520157400216592002801790650001801818650001401836650002101850650001001871650001201881650001301893650001601906650001801922650001701940653001401957653002501971653002201996653002102018653001502039653001502054773009702069856008502166852000902251655001202260IND60524313220221117082030.0161112e20160402xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052431322DNAL7 a10.1080/00049158.2016.11511482doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFerguson, I.J.,10aFuture rotations problem  ap. 122-125.  aCommercial forest owners and managers often complain that valuations of their forest estates have negative values for ‘Future Rotations’ and invariably cast the discount rate as the villain in causing these negative values. In this study, stochastic analyses of the valuation of a hypothetical estate of radiata pine (Pinus radiata D.Don) show that fire or similar natural disasters are one cause. Additional expenditure on fire suppression and protection and precision silviculture may be justified if the relative frequency of large fires can be lowered. Stochastic analyses of individual stands also show that replanting the stand of worst productivity contributed a deadweight loss to estate value. Replanting the stand of mid-level productivity would result in a 70% (approx.) probability of a loss, while replanting the stand of the best productivity would result in a very low probability of a loss. Planned replanting of stands of poor prospective profitability is, therefore, another cause of negative values of Future Rotations. Replanting is an investment decision. Stands that cannot be raised to a profitable level through precision silviculture should be sold, leased for other uses, or otherwise converted to alternative uses involving low net management costs. New technologies and designs need to be developed for precision silviculture to provide less expensive and more precise and timely methods for statistically discriminating between treatments. The Future Rotations problem is a management and research challenge, not an insuperable barrier.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPinus radiata 3adisasters 3afire suppression 3afires 3aforests 3amanagers 3aprobability 3aprofitability 3asilviculture 0aValuation 0adeterministic models 0astochastic models 0afuture rotations 0ainvestment 0areplanting0 tAustralian forestry.g2016 Apr. 2, v. 79, no. 2 p.122-125dTaylor & Francisx2325-60877nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00049158.2016.11511483Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02430naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001800155245011400173300001600287520104100303592002801344650002401372650001201396650001101408650001701419650001901436650000901455650001501464650000701479650002701486650002001513650001501533650000901548653003801557653002701595653000701622653002301629700001501652700002001667700001201687700001601699700001501715700001601730700001501746773007701761856008901838852000901927655001201936IND60561764020221116175745.0170719e201704  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056176402DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2016.12.1372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuang, Jinhui10aInfluence of pH on heavy metal speciation and removal from wastewater using micellar-enhanced ultrafiltration  ap. 199-206.  apH plays an important role in heavy metal removal during micellar-enhanced ultrafiltration (MEUF). In the present work, the influence of pH on heavy metal speciation and removal from wastewater by MEUF was investigated using an anionic surfactant (sodium dodecyl sulfate, SDS) and a hydrophilic membrane (polyether sulfone). Experiments were performed with pH values in the range of 1–12. Metal ion removal efficiency (R) was used to assess the effects of the MEUF process. Results showed that better removal rate of copper and cadmium was achieved at high pH values (pH > 3) with SDS feed concentration of 8 mM, while the optimal pH range was 3–10 for zinc and lead. The corresponding efficiencies for heavy metal removal decreased with the increasing feed concentration of metal ions under the pH conditions of 1–12. Furthermore, the heavy metal ion removal rate (50 mg/L) followed the order of Pb2+ > Cd2+ > Zn2+ > Cu2+. These results showed that pH is a key parameter in metal ion speciation and removal during MEUF.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanionic surfactants 3acadmium 3acopper 3aheavy metals 3ahydrophilicity 3alead 3ametal ions 3apH 3asodium dodecyl sulfate 3aultrafiltration 3awastewater 3azinc 0aMicellar-enhanced ultrafiltration 0aHeavy metal speciation 0apH 0aRemoval efficiency1 aYuan, Fang1 aZeng, Guangming1 aLi, Xue1 aKu, Yenlin,1 aShi, Lixiu1 aLiu, Wenchu1 aShi, Yahui0 tChemosphere.g2017 Apr., v. 173 p.199-206dElsevier Ltdx0045-65357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2016.12.1373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03088naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130100001600148245009700164300001400261520153300275592002801808650001201836650002501848650002501873650003101898650001401929650001301943650001601956650001801972650001001990650001102000650001602011650001602027650001702043650002102060650001802081650001002099650001802109650000902127650001302136650001702149650002602166650001302192650001202205650001402217650002502231700002102256700001902277700001302296700002002309773010002329856008402429852000902513655001202522IND4445932020221118234804.0141111e20110110xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444593202DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vetpar.2010.09.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDkhil, M.A.10aAnticoccidial and antiinflammatory activity of garlic in murine Eimeria papillata infections  ap. 66-72.  aCoccidiosis with the protozoan parasite Eimeria as the infectious agent causes enormous economic losses, particularly in poultry farms. Here, we investigated the effects of garlic on the outcome of coccidiosis caused by Eimeria papillata in male Balb/c mice. The data showed that mice infected with E. papillata revealed an output of 3260±680 oocysts per gram faeces on day 4 p.i.. This output is significantly decreased to 1820±415 oocysts in garlic-treated mice. Infection also induced inflammation and injury of the liver. This was evidenced (i) as increases in inflammatory cellular infiltrations, dilated sinusoids, and vacuolated hepatocytes, (ii) as increased mRNA levels of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and of the cytokines interferon gamma (IFN-γ), and interleukin-6 (IL-6), (iii) as increased plasma levels of alanine and aspartate aminotransferases, alkaline phosphatase, γ-glutamyl transferase and total bilirubin, (iv) as increased production of nitric oxide derived products (nitrite/nitrate) and malondialdehyde, and (v) as lowered glutathione levels and decreased activities of catalase and superoxide dismutase, respectively. All these infection-induced parameters were significantly less altered during garlic treatment. In particular, garlic counteracted the E. papillata-induced loss of glutathione and the activities of catalase and superoxide dismutase. Our data indicated that garlic treatment significantly attenuated inflammation and injury of the liver induced by E. papillata infections.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEimeria 3aalanine transaminase 3aalkaline phosphatase 3aanti-inflammatory activity 3abilirubin 3acatalase 3acoccidiosis 3acoccidiostats 3afeces 3agarlic 3aglutathione 3ahepatocytes 3ainflammation 3ainterferon-gamma 3ainterleukin-6 3aliver 3amessenger RNA 3amice 3anitrates 3anitric oxide 3anitric oxide synthase 3anitrites 3aoocysts 3aparasites 3asuperoxide dismutase1 aAbdel-Baki, A.S.1 aWunderlich, F.1 aSies, H.1 aAl-Quraishy, S.0 tVeterinary parasitology.g2011 Jan. 10, v. 175, no. 1-2 p.66-72dElsevier B.V.x0304-40177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetpar.2010.09.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02910naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100005400155245011200209500001400321520163500335592002801970650001501998650001902013650001402032650002302046650001502069650002502084650001402109650001902123650002102142653001802163653001202181653001802193653000802211700002602219700001602245700001702261700002002278773009102298856009002389852000902479655001202488IND60720530920221119092952.0210212e202104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072053092DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2020.1293172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Jing1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5851-281612aA first-principles study on strain engineering of monolayer stanene for enhanced catalysis of CO2 reduction  aNAL-light  aUsing first-principles calculations, we investigated the changes in the lattice structure, electronic structures and catalytic performance for CO₂ reduction reaction (CO₂RR) of stanene under applied strain. Our calculations showed that the initial buckled honeycomb structure of free-standing stanene becomes increasingly flat upon the increase of tensile strain. Stanene remains its gapless semiconductor characteristic within the strain range of −2% and 2%, beyond which a semiconductor-to-metal transition occurs. Under strain, the adsorption of CO is weakened, which can facilitate the desorption of product CO, enabling a strained stanene to be a better catalyst for CO₂RR to CO than strain-free stanene. In particular, the stanene with 4% strain may give rise to the best performance because of the weakest CO adsorption (Eadsorp= −0.15 eV). The adsorption of intermediate product COOH on stanene is tunable with strain. We also evaluated the overall catalytic performance of the strained stanene based on the adsorption of CO and COOH and the selectivity against HER. If the reduction of COOH is governed by adsorption of the intermediate, a 10% strain may give a stronger COOH adsorption, weaker CO adsorption and better selectivity against HER, leading to an enhanced catalytic performance for CO₂RR to CO. On the other hand, if the reduction of COOH is governed by desorption, a tensile strain higher than 4% may result in an enhanced catalytic performance. Our study here suggests that strain-tuned stanene might serve as an optimal electrocatalyst for CO₂RR to CO with a high activity and selectivity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3acarbon dioxide 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3adesorption 3aintermediate product 3amaterials 3asemiconductors 3atensile strength 0aCO2 reduction 0aStanene 0aStrain effect 0aDFT1 aJohnson Goh, Kuan Eng1 aYu, Zhi Gen1 aWong, Rui En1 aZhang, Yong-Wei0 tChemosphere.g2021 Apr., v. 268 p.129317-dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2020.1293173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02557naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003900111040001800150100001600168245007700184300001600261520088100277592002801158650002101186650001601207650002201223650001301245650002201258650001401280650001401294650001001308650001901318650001701337650002601354650003101380650001601411650001201427650001301439650002501452650000901477650002901486650003301515650002801548650001901576650003301595650002601628650002401654650002001678700001701698700001901715700001901734700001701753700001901770773008401789856008501873852000901958655001201967IND4468402720221119001321.0141112e201208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446840272DNAL7 a224649242pmid7 a10.1016/j.meatsci.2012.03.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKomprda, T.10aMeat quality characteristics of lambs of three organically raised breeds  ap. 499-505.  aCarcass and meat (muscullus quadriceps femoris [MQF]) quality characteristics were evaluated in ten lambs per each of Zwartbles (ZW), Suffolk (SF) and Oxford Down (OD) breeds, raised organically and slaughtered at a mean live weight of 38kg.

In a seminal paper, Hinegardner and Rosen (Am Nat 106:621–644, 1972) suggested that taxa characterized by larger genomes should also display disproportionately stronger fluctuations in genome size. Therefore, according to the Hinegardner and Rosen (HR) hypothesis, there should be a negative correlation between average within-family genome size and its corresponding coefficient of variation (CV), a prediction that was supported by their analysis of the genomes of 275 species of fish. In this study we reevaluate the HR hypothesis using an expanded dataset (2050 genome size records). Moreover, in addition to the use of standard linear regression techniques, we also conducted modern comparative analyses that take into account phylogenetic non-independence. Our analyses failed to confirm the negative relationship detected in the original study, suggesting that the evolution of genome size in fishes might be more complex than envisioned by the HR hypothesis. Interestingly, the frequency distribution of fish genome sizes was strongly skewed, even on a logarithmic scale, suggesting that the dynamics underlying genome size evolution are driven by multiplicative phenomena, which might include chromosomal rearrangements and the expansion of transposable elements.  aPublisher supplied data 3achromosome aberrations 3adata collection 3afish 3agenome 3agenomics 3alinear models 3aphylogeny 3aprediction 3atransposons 2aAnimals 2aDNAxgenetics 2aEvolution, Molecular 2aFishesxgenetics 2aGenomexgenetics 2aPhylogeny1 aTorres, Rodrigo A.1 aBrito, Diego M.

The hypothesis that the growth and mortality characteristics of distinct populations differ along a latitudinal gradient was tested. Sampling was performed monthly in Macaé, Ubatuba, Santos/São Vicente, and Cananéia over a 1‐ to 2‐year period. Growth and longevity parameters were estimated by the von Bertalanffy growth equation models. Total mortality (Z) was estimated by length‐converted catch curves. Growth parameters differed between sexes: males reached smaller sizes, showed larger growth coefficients (k) and higher mortality, and lived less than females in the four studied regions. Rather than finding a latitudinal gradient, our results support the hypothesis that distinct local environmental characteristics and fishing pressures alter the growth and population dynamics of Xiphopenaeus spp. in different areas. Our study indicates that the stocks of Xiphopenaeus spp. are overexploited, highlighting the importance of management plans to prevent the collapse of stocks and maintain them at sustainable levels for long‐term exploitation.  aPublisher supplied data  a2007/57316‐9cFundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo  a2010/50188‐8cFundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo  a2012/14874‐0cFundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo  a2018/13685‐5cFundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo  a2020/14484‐3cFundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo  a23038.004310/2014‐85cCoordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior  a88887.161311/2017‐00cCoordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior  a155813/2018‐8cConselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico  a306672/2018‐9cConselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico  a308653/2014‐9cConselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico  a406006/2012‐1cConselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico 3aPenaeidae 3aequations 3alongevity 3amortality 3aoceanography 3apopulation dynamics 3ashrimp 3aBrazil1 aHeckler, Gisele Salgado1 aSantos, Ana Paula Freitas1 aCastilho, Antonio Leão1 aPescinelli, Régis Augusto1 aCosta, Rogerio Caetano0 tFisheries oceanography.g2021 Sept., v. 30, no. 5 p.499-514dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:J000000070x1054-60067nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/fog.125333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02948naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002800155245012600183500001400309520162700323592002801950650001501978650001501993650001202008650001602020650001502036650001202051650002002063650001502083650002202098650002302120650001302143650001502156650002502171653000802196653002002204653002102224700001902245700003102264700001702295773009102312856009002403852000902493655001202502IND60720531020221119092927.0210212e202104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072053102DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2020.1293182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEscudero-Curiel, Silvia13aAn approach towards Zero-Waste wastewater technology: Fluoxetine adsorption on biochar and removal by the sulfate radical  aNAL-light  aThe appearance of pharmaceuticals in the aquatic environments has become a serious problem because of their hazardous effect on the biota. Therefore, great efforts are focussed in the removal to these pollutants from wastewaters. In this study, an innovative technology based on the principles of Zero-Waste for the management of wastewater streams is presented. Hence, adsorption of fluoxetine (FLX), selected as a model pollutant, in an eco-friendly adsorbent, biochar, was followed by an in situ removal of the pharmaceutical in the solid matrix by the action of sulfate radicals. Initially, an in-depth characterisation of the adsorbent and the adsorption process was carried out. The pseudo-second order kinetic and Freundlich isotherm described well the process, and the electrostatic attractions were revealed as the primary adsorption mechanism. Later, the removal of the FLX was studied by the sulfate radicals, in the presence of activators (Fe²⁺ and citric acid), in liquid and onto the biochar medium. It was concluded that in order to enhance the pollutant removal it is necessary the presence of both activators in liquid media. However, in in situ removal onto biochar, it was not necessary the Fe²⁺ presence and only the addition of complexing agents was required as a result of biochar’s mineral content. Finally, the applicability of the proposed approach was studied in fixed-bed column assays where the adsorption and the removal of the pollutant were efficiently accomplished. This fact confirms the suitability of the developed process as a viable alternative in the treatment of wastewaters.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3abiochar 3acitric acid 3afluoxetine 3aliquids 3amineral content 3apollutants 3apollution control 3asorption isotherms 3asulfates 3awastewater 3awastewater treatment 0aPMS 0aSulfate radical 0aCircular economy1 aPenelas, Uxía1 aSanromán, Maria Ángeles,1 aPazos, Marta0 tChemosphere.g2021 Apr., v. 268 p.129318-dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2020.1293183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02589naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001700155245013000172300001600302520120700318592002801525650001401553650001301567650004901580650001801629650001301647650001401660650001101674650001301685650002501698653001101723653001201734653001101746653000901757653002501766700001901791700001701810700001801827700001901845700001901864700001901883700002701902773009101929856009002020852000902110655001202119IND60589502020221122044514.0200607e201804  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058950202DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2017.12.1942doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDong, Hongyu10aReinvestigating the role of reactive species in the oxidation of organic co-contaminants during Cr(VI) reactions with sulfite  ap. 593-597.  aExperimental work was undertaken in this study to re-investigate the mechanisms and active species responsible for oxidation of co-contaminants in the Cr(VI)/HSO₃⁻ reaction system. Batch experiments showed that the degradation rates of 4-chlorophenol (4-CP) correlated well with the rates of Cr(VI) reduction by sulfite in the same solutions, and that O₂₍ₐq₎ was necessary for the oxidation of 4-CP. Multiple lines of evidences indicate that Cr(VI)/HSO₃⁻ reaction is a SO₄⁻-based oxidation process. SO₃⁻ was generated in Cr(VI)/HSO₃⁻ system based on the electron spin resonance spectra, which could be transformed to secondary radicals (SO₄⁻, SO₅⁻, and HO). The contribution of SO₅⁻ was ruled out through almost complete inhibition of methanol (MeOH) on 4-CP degradation. Considering the negligible inhibition of tert-butanol (TBA) on 4-CP degradation, SO₄⁻ was identified to be reactive species in Cr(VI)/HSO₃⁻ process. This result was further verified by almost no degradation of nitrobenzene and the inhibiting effect of Cl⁻ in Cr(VI)/HSO₃⁻ process. This mechanism is beneficial to application of Cr(VI)/HSO₃⁻ system in wastewater treatment.  aPublisher supplied data 3achlorides 3achromium 3aelectron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy 3afree radicals 3amethanol 3aoxidation 3aoxygen 3asulfites 3awastewater treatment 0aCr(VI) 0aSulfite 0aSO4− 0a4-CP 0aWastewater treatment1 aWei, Guangfeng1 aFan, Wenjuan1 aMa, Shangchen1 aZhao, Hongying1 aZhang, Weixian1 aGuan, Xiaohong1 aStrathmann, Timothy J.0 tChemosphere.g2018 Apr., v. 196 p.593-597dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2017.12.1943Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03203naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100006800140245008600208300001800294500002000312520163500332592002801967650001901995650001902014650001202033650002602045650001902071650002702090650001202117650001502129650002702144650001702171650001902188650001902207650001202226650002802238650001802266650002002284700006902304700008702373700006802460773013302528856007502661852000902736655001202745IND60788219620221120125249.0220811e202111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078821962DNAL7 a10.1002/jeq2.202922doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMaharajan, Theivanayagam1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7343-285410aManagement of phosphorus nutrient amid climate change for sustainable agriculture  ap. 1303-1324.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aNutrients are essential for plant growth and development and influence overall agricultural production. Phosphorus (P) is a major nutrient required for many physiological and biochemical functions of a plant. Phosphate rock is the major source of phosphate fertilizer but is becoming increasingly limited in both developing and developed countries. The resources of phosphate rock need to be conserved, and import dependency on phosphate fertilizer needs to be minimized; this will help increase the availability of phosphate fertilizer over the next 300 yr. Climate change creates new challenges in the management of nutrients including P, affecting the overall production of crops. The availability, acquisition, and translocation of P are influenced by the fluctuation of temperatures, pH, drought, and elevated CO₂. Both lower and higher soil temperatures reduce uptake and translocation of P. High soil pH affects P concentration and decreases the rate of plant P uptake. Low soil pH decreases the activity of soil microorganisms, the rate of transpiration, and P uptake and utilization. Elevated CO₂ decreases P uptake from soil by the plants. Future research is needed on chemical, molecular, microbiological, and physiological aspects to improve the understanding on how temperature, pH, drought, and elevated CO₂ affect the availability, acquisition, and transport of P by plants. Better P management strategies are required to secure the P supply to ensure long‐term protection of soil fertility and to avoid environmental impacts such as eutrophication and water pollution, ensuring sustainable food production.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon dioxide 3aclimate change 3adrought 3aenvironmental quality 3aeutrophication 3agrowth and development 3aimports 3aphosphorus 3aphosphorus fertilizers 3aplant growth 3arock phosphate 3asoil fertility 3asoil pH 3asustainable agriculture 3atranspiration 3awater pollution1 aCeasar, Stanislaus Antony1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4106-15311 aKrishna, Thumadath Palayullaparambil Ajeesh1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7788-44361 aIgnacimuthu, Savarimuthu1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8467-789X0 tJournal of environmental quality.g2021 Nov., v. 50, no. 6 p.1303-1324dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl1642x0047-24257nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jeq2.202923Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02151naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245010300166300001600269520102100285592002801306650001601334650002201350650001501372650002001387650001901407650001101426653002201437653002401459653002401483653002101507653003201528700001501560700002001575773008901595856008401684852000901768655001201777IND60600478520221120053231.0180703e20140814xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060047852DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2014.05.1142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGeraili, A.10aTechnology analysis of integrated biorefineries through process simulation and hybrid optimization  ap. 145-159.  aThis work investigates the design and modeling of fully integrated processes which utilize renewable feedstocks as raw materials by evaluating alternative technology options and possible process integrations to select the optimal configuration according to calculated process yields and economic profit criteria.

Biodiesel is a proper alternative for fossil fuel, which can be blended with diesel in different proportions and use in vehicles. As of present, the essential problem with biodiesel is its relatively high finished price compared to the conventional diesel. A common way to reduce the cost of biodiesel production is to use heterogeneous magnetic alkaline catalysts, which is easily separated using an external magnetic field. Thus, there is a perspective promoting the potential development of clean magnetic catalysts for large scale synthesis of biodiesel. This review study is an attempt to investigate the application of heterogeneous magnetic catalysts for biodiesel production through the transesterification process. To this end, synthesis methods and physical properties of magnetic catalysts using various analyses were completely studied. Also, the mechanism of biodiesel production using magnetic nanocatalysts has been studied. Furthermore, impact of different oil sources on the yield of biodiesel production was fully investigated and their outcomes were compared. Then, the impact of different factors on the biodiesel yield in the presence of magnetic catalysts were investigated. Besides, the physical properties of biodiesel produced using magnetic catalysts were fully studied and compared to those of conventional diesel based on international standards.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiodiesel 3aenergy 3afeedstocks 3afossil fuels 3amagnetic fields 3ananocatalysts 3aoils 3apollution 3aprices 3atransesterification 0aMagnetic catalyst 0aTransesterification 0aFuel 0aRenewable energy 0aBiodiesel1 aEsmaeili, Hossein1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3417-84401 aMoghadas, Bahareh Kamyab0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2021 July 10, v. 305 p.127200-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2021.1272003Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03098naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001600148245012400164300001800288520151000306592002801816650001901844650002501863650001701888650002501905650001801930650001301948650001801961650001301979650002101992650001702013650001002030650002402040650001502064650001802079650001702097650001402114650002102128650001502149650001602164650002602180650001502206650002502221650001402246650001602260700001702276700002302293700002402316773012402340856008302464852000902547655001202556IND60795051520221120055021.0220929e202211  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079505152DNAL7 a10.1007/s11947-022-02892-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMagri, Anna10aEffects of Ascorbic Acid and Melatonin Treatments on Antioxidant System in Fresh-Cut Avocado Fruits During Cold Storage  ap. 2468-2482.  aFresh-cut fruits have a limited postharvest life compared to fresh intact fruits; they have gained considerable market share. In this study, we investigated the effectiveness of melatonin (1 mM) and ascorbic acid (20 mM) treatments, alone or in combination, on qualitative traits and antioxidant systems of fresh-cut avocado fruits during 14 days of cold storage (4 ± 0.5 °C and RH 95 ± 0.5%). The results showed that the combined melatonin and ascorbic acid treatment delayed colour changes, thereby retarding the ripening process and weight loss compared with separate melatonin and ascorbic acid treatments. Furthermore, melatonin and ascorbic acid treatment showed a synergistic effect on fresh-cut avocado, improving the enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidant system during cold storage. Compared with the control, the total polyphenol and flavonoid contents in the treated avocado were increased, and a higher antioxidant activity was observed. The combined treatment improved catalase, ascorbate peroxidase, and superoxide dismutase activities; decreased polyphenol oxidase and guaiacol peroxidase activities; and effectively reduced membrane damage by influencing lipoxygenase activity. These results indicate that the combination of melatonin and ascorbic acid could be a useful, reliable, and eco-friendly postharvest treatment to maintain physicochemical and nutraceutical features, reduce oxidative stress and enzymatic browning, and extend the shelf life of fresh-cut avocado.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacid treatment 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3aascorbate peroxidase 3aascorbic acid 3aavocados 3abioprocessing 3acatalase 3acatechol oxidase 3acold storage 3acolor 3adietary supplements 3aflavonoids 3alipoxygenases 3amarket share 3amelatonin 3aoxidative stress 3aperoxidase 3apolyphenols 3apostharvest treatment 3ashelf life 3asuperoxide dismutase 3asynergism 3aweight loss1 aCice, Danilo1 aCapriolo, Giuseppe1 aPetriccione, Milena0 tFood and bioprocess technology.g2022 Nov., v. 15, no. 11 p.2468-2482dSpringer USwJournal:jnl4235020x1935-51307nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11947-022-02892-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02765naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245006000168300001600228520137400244592002801618650001301646650001401659650001101673650002001684650001601704650001401720650002201734650003101756650003701787650001701824650001401841650001501855650002001870650003301890650001601923650001401939653002101953653002301974653001201997653002002009700001802029700001602047700002602063773008902089856008402178852000902262655001202271IND60600478820221120053131.0180703e20140801xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060047882DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2014.06.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiaquat, A.M.10aImpact of biodiesel blend on injector deposit formation  ap. 813-823.  aContinued legislative pressure to reduce exhaust emissions from CI (compression ignition) has resulted in the development of advanced fuel injection equipment. This advanced injection system produces higher temperatures and pressures at the injector tip, where deposit formation is initiated. In this research, an endurance test was carried out for 250 h on 2 fuel samples; DF (diesel fuel) as baseline fuel and JB20 (20% jatropha biodiesel and 80% DF) in a single-cylinder CI engine. The effects of JB20 on injector nozzle deposits, engine lubricating oil, and fuel economy and exhaust emissions were investigated during the endurance test. According to the results of the investigation, visual inspection showed some deposit accumulation on injectors for both fuel samples. SEM (scanning electron microscopy) and EDX (energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy) analysis showed greater carbon deposits on and around the injector tip for JB20 compared to the engine running with DF. Similarly, lubricating oil analysis presented excessive wear metal concentrations and decreased viscosity values when the engine was fueled with JB20. Finally, fuel economy and emission results during the endurance test showed higher BSFC (brake specific fuel consumption) and NOx emissions, and lower HC (hydrocarbons) and CO (carbon monoxide) emissions, for the JB20 blend compared to DF.  aPublisher supplied data 3aJatropha 3abiodiesel 3acarbon 3acarbon monoxide 3adiesel fuel 3aemissions 3aendurance testing 3aenergy use and consumption 3aenergy-dispersive X-ray analysis 3ahydrocarbons 3ainjectors 3alubricants 3anitrogen oxides 3ascanning electron microscopy 3atemperature 3aviscosity 0aInjector deposit 0aJatropha biodiesel 0aSEM-EDX 0aLubrication oil1 aMasjuki, H.H.1 aKalam, M.A.1 aRizwanul Fattah, I.M.0 tEnergy.g2014 Aug. 01, v. 72 p.813-823dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2014.06.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03846naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245012300166300001800289520158400307592002801891596007101919596007101990596007102061596007102132596007102203596008402274596008402358596008402442596008402526596008402610650002402694650002502718650001702743650001802760650001002778650001502788650001102803650002002814650001902834650001902853650002202872650002002894650002202914650001502936650001102951650002502962700001602987700001703003700001803020700001403038773012403052856008303176852000903259655001203268IND60795051620221120064308.0220929e202211  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079505162DNAL7 a10.1007/s11947-022-02894-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuang, Jiayin14aThe Positive Influences of Roselle Anthocyanin Active Film on Shrimp (Penaeus vannamei) Sensory Attribute Modification  ap. 2483-2498.  aThe enhancement behaviors of polyvinyl alcohol/hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose/roselle anthocyanin (PHR) film on sensory and physico-chemical properties of Penaeus vannamei were investigated. The shrimp packaged by PHR film displayed better sensory profiles with higher sensory scores and lower rejection degree (62.67 ± 2.31%). Compared with control group, the color parameters were improved by PHR film, such as higher lightness (36.30 ± 1.23), lower redness (6.67 ± 1.15), and yellowness (6.67 ± 0.51) as well as less browning effects. Microstructure observation revealed that the PHR film could keep more compact and uniform muscle tissue with less cracks and small fragments. In addition, PHR film was effective in increasing of water holding capacities (80.23 ± 1.70%) and maintenance of flavor characteristics. Meanwhile, the PHR films had abilities to delay protein structure alterations, manifesting as higher total protein contents (23.36 ± 2.58 mg/mL) and less generation of carbonyl groups (5.12 ± 0.16 nmol/mg) and disulfide bonds (3.11 ± 0.07 mol/10⁵ g). Moreover, statistical analysis results demonstrated the close relationship between sensory and physico-chemical properties. Then, the possible enhancement mechanism was proposed that the functional properties of PHR film were responsible for the protein stabilization, leading to less quality deterioration and higher sensory profiles. Thus, the PHR film was a promising food packaging for sensory attribute enhancement and shelf life extension of Penaeus vannamei.  aPublisher supplied data  a321CXTD1012cHainan Provincial Natural Science Foundation of China  a321CXTD1012cHainan Provincial Natural Science Foundation of China  a321CXTD1012cHainan Provincial Natural Science Foundation of China  a321CXTD1012cHainan Provincial Natural Science Foundation of China  a321CXTD1012cHainan Provincial Natural Science Foundation of China  aRHDRC202117cScientific Research Foundation of Hainan Tropical Ocean University  aRHDRC202117cScientific Research Foundation of Hainan Tropical Ocean University  aRHDRC202117cScientific Research Foundation of Hainan Tropical Ocean University  aRHDRC202117cScientific Research Foundation of Hainan Tropical Ocean University  aRHDRC202117cScientific Research Foundation of Hainan Tropical Ocean University 3aHibiscus sabdariffa 3aLitopenaeus vannamei 3aanthocyanins 3abioprocessing 3acolor 3adisulfides 3aflavor 3amethylcellulose 3amicrostructure 3amuscle tissues 3apolyvinyl alcohol 3aprotein content 3aprotein structure 3ashelf life 3ashrimp 3astatistical analysis1 aHu, Zhiheng1 aLi, Gaoshang1 aChen, Jianchu1 aHu, Yaqin0 tFood and bioprocess technology.g2022 Nov., v. 15, no. 11 p.2483-2498dSpringer USwJournal:jnl4235020x1935-51307nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11947-022-02894-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02602naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245016300172300001800335520131300353592002801666650002201694650001401716650001401730650002301744650001701767650002001784650001301804650003301817650001901850650001101869650004401880650001701924700001801941700002001959700002401979773010602003856008602109852000902195655001202204IND60580157220221119093504.0170912e20170912xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058015722DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.macromol.7b012142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aD’Auria, Ilaria10aEfficient Modulation of Polyethylene Microstructure by Proper Activation of (α-Diimine)Ni(II) Catalysts: Synthesis of Well-Performing Polyethylene Elastomers  ap. 6586-6594.  aThe activation of a prototypical nickel(II) Brookhart catalyst by either methylalumoxane (MAO) or diethylaluminum chloride (AlEt₂Cl) under a variety of conditions showed that a proper choice of the mode of activation is a powerful tool to modulate the polymer microstructure. In particular, use of AlEt₂Cl instead of MAO resulted in the production of more branched polyethylenes with a higher content of long chain branches and even some “branches on branches”. Characterization of these materials by NMR, thermal, X-ray diffraction, and mechanical analyses provided insight into the relationships between the microstructure and the crystallization behavior and the elasticity of the polymers. For these branched polyethylenes, a transition from plastomeric toward elastomeric behavior occurs for branch concentrations much lower than for ethylene–propylene copolymers and like those observed for ethylene copolymers with bulkier comonomers. For elastomeric materials, reduction of branch concentration implies two relevant advantages: (i) reduction of glass transition temperature becoming closer to that of polyethylene; (ii) more efficient radical cross-linking with reduction of degradation reactions. An additional advantage is, of course, a polymer production process involving only ethylene.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3acatalysts 3achlorides 3acomposite polymers 3acrosslinking 3acrystallization 3aethylene 3aglass transition temperature 3amicrostructure 3anickel 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3apolyethylene1 aMaggio, Mario1 aGuerra, Gaetano1 aPellecchia, Claudio0 tMacromolecules.g2017 Sept. 12, v. 50, no. 17 p.6586-6594dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.macromol.7b012143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02271naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002100092024004700113040001800160100002300178245007900201300001600280500000900296520110500305592002801410650001501438650002101453650002401474700002401498773020701522852000901729856011201738856009401850961001301944655001201957IND2181984420221120084058.0191028e199803  wiu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND218198442DNAL7 a10113/202772hdl7 a10.2134/jeq1998.00472425002700020005x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGburek, William J.10aHydrologic Controls on Phosphorus Loss from Upland Agricultural Watersheds  ap. 267-277.  aepub  aDevelopment of strategies for controlling P loss from upland agricultural watersheds requires an ability to identify specific source areas of P at field and farm scales, and to predict their resultant effects at the watershed scale. Key to identification of P source areas is defining the interaction between P availability over the landscape and its potential for movement to the watershed outlet by runoff and erosion. A current weakness in quantifying this interaction is determining specific zones of runoff and erosion within a watershed, that is, source areas for the P transport mechanisms. Research results from a series of studies within a small, upland agricultural watershed in east-central Pennsylvania show that the zones of runoff production, and consequently the areas ultimately controlling most P transport, are often a limited and identifiable portion of the landscape. Quantifying the hydrologic controls on P transport within and from a watershed in this way allows us to focus management options on small and definable portions of the total watershed that contribute most export.  aPublisher supplied data 3aphosphorus 3alosses from soil 3awatershed hydrology1 aSharpley, Andrew N.0 tJournal of environmental quality.g1998 Mar., v. 27, no. 2 p.267-277dAmerican Society of Agronomy, Crop Science Society of America, and Soil Science Society of AmericawJournal:jnl1642x0047-24257nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/202773Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2134/jeq1998.00472425002700020005x3Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle02846naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245011300170300001600283520149300299592002801792650001301820650001901833650001901852650001401871650000701885650002701892650001901919650001501938650001901953650000901972650002701981650001602008650002102024653002102045653000902066653002202075653001902097700001502116700005602131773011802187856008602305852000902391655001202400IND60629770120221118073716.0190206e20180715xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062977012DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jenvman.2018.04.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPark, Kyungmin10aPhotodegradation of perfluorooctanoic acid by graphene oxide-deposited TiO2 nanotube arrays in aqueous phase  ap. 333-339.  aPerfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) is a persistent organic pollutant in the environment with serious health risks including endocrine-disrupting characteristics, immunotoxicity, and causing developmental defects. The photocatalytic deposition has proven to be an inexpensive, effective, and sustainable technology for the removal of PFOA in the aqueous phase. Most investigations are conducted in ultrapure water at concentrations higher than those detected in actual water systems. A few studies deal with the toxicity of treated water. In this research, the photocatalytic degradation of PFOA, including photo-oxidative and photo-reductive degradation, is reviewed comprehensively. Compared to photo-oxidation, photo-reduction is more suitable for PFOA removal since it favors defluorination of PFOA and complete mineralization. We used graphene oxide/TiO2 nanotubes array for photocatalytic degradation of PFOA. The effects of key parameters on the photocatalytic degradation and defluorination processes of PFOA, such as initial PFOA concentration, initial pH of the solution, an initial temperature of the solution, and external bias constant potential, are addressed. We observed that at pH 3 the PFOA degradation was around 83% in 4 h, and at 75 °C almost complete PFOA degradation was observed in 2.5 h. In photoelectrocatalytic process at 2.0 V external bias 97% of PFOA was degraded in 4 h. The mechanisms of the PFOA photodegradation process are also discussed in detail.  aPublisher supplied data 3agraphene 3aimmunotoxicity 3amineralization 3ananotubes 3apH 3aperfluorooctanoic acid 3aphotocatalysis 3aphotolysis 3aphotooxidation 3arisk 3asustainable technology 3atemperature 3atitanium dioxide 0aPhotodegradation 0aPFOA 0aGO/TNA composites 0aUV irradiation1 aAli, Imran1 aKim, Jong-Oh1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1957-58940 tJournal of environmental management.g2018 July 15, v. 218 p.333-339dElsevier LtdwJournal:2018x0301-47977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2018.04.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02542naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245013700166300001600303520114000319592002801459650001101487650001601498650001101514650001801525650001301543650001701556650003101573650002101604650001101625650001901636650001001655650001301665650001101678653001101689653001101700653001901711653001501730700001501745700001601760700001201776700001401788700002001802700001201822773012201834856008301956852000902039655001202048IND60765923220221116225601.0220523e202206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076592322DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcis.2022.01.1702doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Zhihao14aThe yolk-shell nanorod structure of Ni3Se2@C electrodes boosting charge transfer and cyclability in high-performance supercapacitors  ap. 133-140.  aDeveloping novel electrode materials with reasonable structures and ideal conductivity is of great significance for energy storage devices. In this work, Ni₃Se₂@C yolk-shell nanorods are grown on nickel foam (NF) via a one-step selenization and carbonization process. The carbon shell not only improves the conductivity and charge transfer of electrodes, but also inhibits the dissociation of Ni₃Se₂ core during redox reactions, which is crucial to electrochemical performances of SCs. Owing to the yolk-shell nanorod structure, the Ni₃Se₂@C electrode exhibits an outstanding specific capacitance of 1669.7F g⁻¹ at 1 A g⁻¹. Moreover, an asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) is successfully assembled using Ni₃Se₂@C and active carbon (AC) electrodes as the anode and cathode respectively, which delivers remarkable energy-storage characteristics. Specifically, the Ni₃Se₂@C//AC ASC shows a high energy density (31.0 Wh kg⁻¹) at a power density (723.7 W kg⁻¹), and stable cycling performance (97% capacitance retention after 9000 cycles). These results make the Ni₃Se₂@C a promising electrode for SCs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanodes 3acapacitance 3acarbon 3acarbonization 3acathodes 3adissociation 3aelectrochemical capacitors 3aelectrochemistry 3aenergy 3aenergy density 3afoams 3ananorods 3anickel 0aNi3Se2 0aCarbon 0aSupercapacitor 0aYolk-shell1 aJiang, Kun1 aZhu, Zitong1 aYu, Hao1 aChen, Wei1 aHuang, Yongqing1 aFu, Min0 tJournal of colloid and interface science.g2022 June, v. 615 p.133-140dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12461x0021-97977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2022.01.1703Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03776naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001900149245013100168506011700299506007600416520178000492592002802272506003702300650001802337650002402355650001502379650002202394650002502416650001302441650001802454650000902472650001502481650002202496650001302518650002102531650001802552650001702570650003702587651001802624653001302642653001702655653001302672653001902685653002302704653002202727700002302749700002102772700001802793700002202811700001802833700001702851700001702868700002102885700002002906700001802926773011302944856008403057852000903141655001203150IND60744364120221207082038.0220404e202109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074436412DNAL7 a10.1016/j.gecco.2021.e017242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDonald, Julian10aMulti-taxa environmental DNA inventories reveal distinct taxonomic and functional diversity in urban tropical forest fragments  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aUrban expansion and associated habitat transformation drives shifts in biodiversity, with declines in taxonomic and functional diversity. Forests fragments within urban landscapes offer a number of ecosystem services, and help to maintain biodiversity and ecosystem functions. Here, we focus on a tropical forest environment, and on the soil biota. Using eDNA metabarcoding, we compare forest fragments within the city of Cayenne, French Guiana, with a neighbouring continuous undisturbed forest. We wished to determine if urban forest fragments conserve high levels of alpha and beta diversity as well as similar functional composition for plants, soil animals, fungi and bacteria. We found that alpha diversity is similar across habitats for plants and fungi, lower in urban forests for metazoans and higher for bacteria. We also found that urban forests communities differ from undisturbed forests in their taxonomic composition, with urban forests exhibiting greater turnover between fragments potentially caused by ecological drift and limited dispersal. However, their functional composition exhibited limited differences, with an enrichment of palms, arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi and bacteria and a depletion of climber plants and termites. Thus, although urban forest fragments do shelter soil biodiversity that differs from native forests, the losses of soil functions may be relatively limited. This study demonstrates the strong potential of a multi-taxa eDNA approach for rapid inventories across taxonomic kingdoms, in particular for cryptic soil diversity. It also demonstrates the key role of urban forest fragments in conserving biodiversity and ecosystem function, and points to a need for more systematic monitoring of these areas in urban management plans.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDNA barcoding 3aecological function 3aecosystems 3aenvironmental DNA 3afunctional diversity 3ahabitats 3apedodiversity 3asoil 3asoil biota 3aspecies diversity 3ataxonomy 3atropical forests 3aurban forests 3aurbanization 3avesicular arbuscular mycorrhizae 3aFrench Guiana 0aTropical 0aUrban forest 0aLand use 0aSoil diversity 0aCommunity assembly 0aDNA metabarcoding1 aMurienne, Jérôme1 aChave, Jérôme,1 aIribar, Amaia1 aLouisanna, Eliane1 aManzi, Sophie1 aRoy, Melanie1 aTao, Shengli1 aOrivel, Jérôme1 aSchimann, Heidy1 aZinger, Lucie0 tGlobal ecology and conservation.g2021 Sept., v. 29 p.e01724-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23212x2351-98947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gecco.2021.e017243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02541naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001700139245011100156300001800267520124900285592002801534650002201562650002601584650003101610650001801641650001301659650001501672650002301687650001501710650001301725650000901738650001201747650001901759650001801778650004001796700002901836700002301865700002001888773012901908856007302037852000902110655001202119IND60518986520221121043605.0160419e201605  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051898652DNAL7 a10.1002/jsfa.73492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRahati, Sara10aEffect of spinach aqueous extract on wound healing in experimental model diabetic rats with streptozotocin  ap. 2337-2343.  aBACKGROUND: Chronic ulcer is still a serious issue for diabetic patients. Diabetes is a prevalent cause of ulcer regeneration delay and (or) disruption. Since Spinacia oleracea extract contains compounds with anti‐oxidative and anti‐inflammatory effects, this may be effective in accelerating the healing process of ulcers, especially diabetic ulcers. Hence, this study examined the effect of Spinacia oleracea aqueous extract on ulcer regeneration in an experimental animal model. RESULTS: Macroscopic examination of the wounds of the control group and spinach aqueous extract group between 7 and 21 days compared with diabetic group, significant changes were observed (P < 0.05). On microscopic examination, epithelial tissue formation, formation of granulation tissue and new blood vessels in the spinach aqueous extract group and non‐diabetic group compared to the diabetic group showed significant improvements (P < 0.05). Also, significant differences in vascular endothelial growth factor were observed between groups on days 3 and 7 (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: The Spinacia oleracea aqueous extract can be effective in regenerating diabetic ulcers. It affects the speed and structure of the ulcer. © 2015 Society of Chemical Industry  aPublisher supplied data 3aSpinacia oleracea 3aanimal disease models 3aanti-inflammatory activity 3ablood vessels 3adiabetes 3aepithelium 3agranulation tissue 3amicroscopy 3apatients 3arats 3aspinach 3astreptozotocin 3atissue repair 3avascular endothelial growth factors1 aEshraghian, Mohammadreza1 aEbrahimi, Abdolali1 aPishva, Hamideh0 tJournal of the science of food and agriculture.g2016 May, v. 96, no. 7 p.2337-2343dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx0022-51427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jsfa.73493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02805naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002100152245016400173300001600337520137800353592002801731650001501759650001401774650002101788650002001809650001201829650001401841650001601855650003701871650001201908650001401920650001201934650001501946650001201961650001801973650001401991650001402005650001802019700002502037700002402062700001802086700001902104700002102123773008402144856008602228852000902314655001202323IND60096291320221119164133.0141104e201210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009629132DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cryobiol.2012.04.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiang, Yuan Yuan10aEffects of vitrification cryoprotectant treatment and cooling method on the viability and development of buffalo oocytes after intracytoplasmic sperm injection  ap. 151-156.  aIn vitro matured (IVM) buffalo oocytes at the metaphase of the second meiotic division (MII) were vitrified in 20% Me₂SO: 20% EG (v/v) and 0.5M sucrose (VA), or 35% EG (v/v), 50mg/mL polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP), and 0.4M trehalose (VB), either on cryotops or as 2μL microdrops. The viability was assessed after warming by fluorescein diacetate (FDA) staining and all surviving oocytes were subjected to ICSI and ethanol activation. All vitrified groups had similar recovery rates but both VA groups had significantly higher survival and pronuclear formation rates than either of the VB groups. Non treated control oocytes and non cryopreserved oocytes exposed to FDA had significantly higher survival, 2nd polar body extrusion, PN and blastocyst formation rates than any of the four vitrified groups (P<0.05). In conclusion The cryotop and microdrop methods are equally effective for buffalo oocyte vitrification, and although vitrification in VA solution yielded higher rates of survival and formation of 2 pronuclei than VB, the rate of blastocyst formation was comparable for both solutions. A detailed analysis of oocytes that extruded the second polar body after ICSI and activation revealed that only a minority (7–20% of the vitrified and 46–48% of the control oocytes) also had two pronuclei, indicating that normal activation is compromised by vitrification.  aPublisher supplied data 3ablastocyst 3abuffaloes 3acryopreservation 3acryoprotectants 3aethanol 3aextrusion 3afluorescein 3aintracytoplasmic sperm injection 3ameiosis 3ametaphase 3aoocytes 3apronucleus 3asucrose 3asurvival rate 3atrehalose 3aviability 3avitrification1 aSrirattana, Kanokwan1 aPhermthai, Tatsanee1 aSomfai, Tamas1 aNagai, Takashi1 aParnpai, Rangsun0 tCryobiology.g2012 Oct., v. 65, no. 2 p.151-156dElsevier Inc.x0011-22407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cryobiol.2012.04.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01557naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100006700145245008100212300001800293520044900311592002800760650001200788650001400800650001400814650002200828650001400850700002300864700001900887700002000906700002000926700002000946700002000966773013300986856007901119852000901198655001201207IND60736643720220414000000.0210510e20210428xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073664372DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.joc.0c029842doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGramani, Subramanian G.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8536-756X10aCis Selective RCM Study to the 14-Membered Cyclic Subunit of Bielschowskysin  ap. 6160-6168.  aA concise, (Z)-selective ring-closing metathesis (RCM) route to the 14-membered carbocycle of bielschowskysin is detailed using naturally occurring chiral starting materials.

This tribe demonstrates some characters similar to those in Throscidae and Eucnemidae, elucidating the evolutionary process of the Elateroidea. New materials make clear the distinctness of the genera related to Desmatus Dolin, 1975 (tribe Desmatini) from all other Elateridae. Tetraraphes ebersini Iablokoff-Khnzorian, 1961 could be regarded somewhat nearby the subfamily Protagrypninae; however, this species seems to be similar to some Cenozoic groups rather than any of Mesozoic groups. 3ainsect anatomy 3aElateridae 3ainsect morphology 3ainsect taxonomy 3afossils 3azoogeography 3aextinction 3apaleozoology 3anew species 3anew genus 3aChina 0apaleontology 0adescriptions 0aApoclion antennatus 0aTetraraphes ebersini 0aApoclion clavatus 0aAnoixis complanus 0aDesmatinus cognatus 0aParadesmatus dilatatus 0aApoclion dolini 0aDesmatini1 aKirejtshuk, Alexander1 aRen, Dong0 tAnnals of the Entomological Society of America.g2010 Nov., v. 103, no. 6 p.866-874dEntomological Society of Americax0013-87467nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1603/AN090763Available from publisher's Web site  a20110331b20110402c00000000  aINDd4CTe2011/01/25  aOther US 7aarticle02990naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245010300165300001400268520165700282592002801939650002501967650000901992650001102001650001102012650001902023650001702042650001902059650001302078650002302091653001902114653003102133653002302164653003102187653002802218700001202246700001702258700002102275700001702296700001902313773012002332856008302452852000902535655001202544IND60765923320221116225746.0220523e202206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076592332DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcis.2022.01.1732doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Shanshan10aCo-assembly of soluble metal–organic polyhedrons for high-flux thin-film nanocomposite membranes  ap. 10-18.  aWell-developed pore channels and large effective permeation area are sorely needed in developing highly permeable synthetic membranes for the reduction of energy consumption in separation processes. Herein, water stable, soluble and reactive amino-functionalized metal–organic polyhedron (MOP) ZrT-1-NH₂ with intrinsic porosity is co-assembled with lysine (Lys) into a new kind of thin-film nanocomposite (TFN) membranes through in situ interfacial polymerization (IP) with trimesoyl chloride (TMC). Striped structure on the membrane surface is induced by the participation of the amino-MOP in polymerization, which greatly enhances the effective permeation area of the separation layer compared with the membranes feature smooth surface. Meanwhile, the suitable pore aperture of the introduced ZrT-1-NH₂ can also benefit the diffusion of water molecules and block the transport of molecules with bulkier molecular volumes. The results showed that the formed membrane exhibits significantly improved water permeance (27.3 L m⁻² h⁻¹ bar⁻¹, 480% increase) compared with that of the pristine Lys/TMC membrane (4.7 L m⁻² h⁻¹ bar⁻¹). The compositing of ZrT-1-NH₂ also leads to an increase in the rejection selectivity of dye and salt, rejection selectivity of dye/salt mixture, as well as in antifouling and antibacterial properties, making the ZrT-1-NH₂-Lys/TMC composite membrane a potential choice for dye/salt separation. Moreover, this work demonstrates the bright prospects of applying soluble and reactive porous cages in the development of high-loading defect-less TFN membranes for efficient molecular separations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aasymmetric membranes 3adyes 3aenergy 3alysine 3ananocomposites 3apermeability 3apolymerization 3aporosity 3atrimesoyl chloride 0aNanofiltration 0aInterfacial polymerization 0aStriped structures 0aMetal–organic polyhedron 0aThin-film nanocomposite1 aLi, Sen1 aGuo, Xiangyu1 aHuang, Hongliang1 aQiao, Zhihua1 aZhong, Chongli0 tJournal of colloid and interface science.g2022 June, v. 615 p.10-18dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12461x0021-97977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2022.01.1733Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01841naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001900145245010700164300001600271520082900287592002801116650001201144650001501156650001101171650001001182650002001192650001301212650001001225650002001235650001201255650001901267650001501286700002301301773009801324856004801422852000901470655001201479IND4484863420221123045050.0120428e201204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448486342DNAL7 a10.1007/s10336-011-0775-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSandoval, Luis10aCharacteristics of male Spot-bellied Bobwhite (Colinus leucopogon) song during territory establishment  ap. 547-554.  aIn song-learning birds, male song shows a large inter-individual variation that frequently plays an important role in intra- and inter-sexual selection. In other bird groups, such as Galliformes, song learning is absent, and inter-individual song variation is small and expected to play a minor, if any, role in sexual contexts. In the Spot-bellied Bobwhite (Colinus leucopogon) we found that many males have a unique set of song features, and our results suggest that female mate choice in this species is based in part on male song traits. Most paired males in our study had longer songs. In addition, these males established territories in the middle of the breeding season, soon after the onset of the rainy season when increases in herbaceous cover and food resources would likely increase offspring and adult survival.  aPublisher supplied data 3aColinus 3aLeucopogon 3aadults 3abirds 3abreeding season 3alearning 3amales 3amating behavior 3aprogeny 3aterritoriality 3awet season1 aBarrantes, Gilbert0 tJournal of ornithology.g2012 Apr., v. 153, no. 2 p.547-554dSpringer-Verlagx2193-71927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10336-011-0775-1  aDNAL 7aarticle02453naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245014000172300001600312500001900328520104800347592002801395650002901423650001901452650001601471650001301487650001501500650001401515650002101529650002301550650001901573650002201592650001201614650001401626653001801640653002201658653001001680653002901690653002701719653001801746700002001764773011601784856008601900852000901986655001201995IND60697332920221119115900.0200702e20200602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069733292DNAL7 a10.1080/08941920.2019.16728432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJenkins, Jeffrey10aGiant Sequoia—Forest, Monument, or Park?: Political-Legal Mandates and Socio-Ecological Complexity Shaping Landscape-Level Management  ap. 721-737.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aGiant sequoia are endemic to the western slope of the Sierra Nevada, confined to approximately seventy groves spared from 19th century timber harvests. While nearly half of these groves were afforded protections through early National Park designations, only recently at the turn of the 21st century have the remainder of these been given protections on multiple use National Forest land. However, these megaflora continue to be impacted by forces exogenous to the groves themselves, including climatic change, high severity wildfire, exurban land use pressures, and industrial levels of tourism. The history, designation and current management of Giant Sequoia National Monument is emblematic of this shift from proximate impacts to a recognition of more systemic, landscape-level phenomena. We explain this shift in the scale of management through political-legal mandates, climatic and ecological complexity, and permissible recreational activities. The landscape unifies these processes across a monument on forest land, adjoined by parks.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSequoiadendron giganteum 3aclimate change 3aforest land 3aland use 3alandscapes 3amountains 3anational forests 3anational monuments 3anational parks 3atopographic slope 3atourism 3awildfires 0aGiant sequoia 0anational monument 0ascale 0asocio-ecological systems 0avisitor use management 0awildland fire1 aBrown, Madeline0 tSociety & natural resources.g2020 June 2, v. 33, no. 6 p.721-737dRoutledgewJournal:jnl45063x1521-07237nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/08941920.2019.16728433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03037naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002400148245019000172300001600362520147700378592002801855650003701883650001301920650001501933650001101948650002801959650002101987650001502008650000702023650001902030650001102049653002802060653001202088653002402100653002902124653002002153653004802173653001702221653004602238700002402284700002302308700002202331773012202353856008302475852000902558655001202567IND60765923420221116225153.0220523e202206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076592342DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcis.2022.01.1752doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNeßlinger, Vanessa10aCombined in-situ attenuated total reflection-Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and single molecule force studies of poly(acrylic acid) at electrolyte/oxide interfaces at acidic pH  ap. 563-576.  aFundamental adsorption mechanisms of poly(acrylic acid) (PAA) electrolyte/oxide interfaces were analyzed by the combination of in-situ attenuated total reflection-Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy and single molecule force spectroscopy (SMFS). The approach aims at a fundamental understanding of initial states of polymer fouling in chemical microreactors. While the presented FTIR-data provide information on adsorption and desorption kinetics, SMFS studies reveal the corresponding interfacial and intermolecular forces. Silicon oxide and oxide covered FeCr alloy films with small concentrations of Ni were chosen as reference systems for relevant technical reactor components. Adsorption and desorption studies were performed in aqueous electrolytes at acidic pH to simulate the polymerisation process. Ex-situ ellipsometry and atomic force microscopy (AFM) studies of the adsorbed polymer layers as well as X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) of the oxide surfaces complemented the analytical approach. The comparison of the in-situ ATR spectroscopic results and the SMFS data revealed higher molecular adhesion forces on FeCr-oxide covered FeCr alloy films in comparison to the SiOₓ terminated surfaces. The different interactions could be assigned to the specific coordination bonds formed between the carboxylic acid group and surface metal ions in the case of FeCr alloy films. AFM images showed related changes in interfacial film formation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aadhesion 3aadsorption 3aalloys 3aatomic force microscopy 3acarboxylic acids 3adesorption 3apH 3apolymerization 3asilica 0aMacromolecular adhesion 0aFouling 0aAdsorption kinetics 0aPoly(acrylic acid) (PAA) 0aStainless steel 0aAttenuated total reflection FTIR (ATR-FTIR) 0aEllipsometry 0aSingle molecule force spectroscopy (SMFS)1 aOrive, Alejandro G.1 aMeinderink, Dennis1 aGrundmeier, Guido0 tJournal of colloid and interface science.g2022 June, v. 615 p.563-576dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12461x0021-97977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2022.01.1753Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03196naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100005800151245016100209300001800370520159800388592002801986650001102014650001902025650000902044650002502053650002202078650002002100650001102120650002902131650001302160650001202173650001302185650001002198650001002208653002802218653002002246653002802266653001802294653002302312700001402335700001402349700005802363700005602421773014302477856008502620852000902705655001202714IND60630015320221119231821.0190204e20190111xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063001532DNAL7 a10.1021/acssuschemeng.8b057572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Qingchun1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5900-524X10aEfficient Utilization of CO₂ in a Coal to Ethylene Glycol Process Integrated with Dry/Steam-Mixed Reforming: Conceptual Design and Technoeconomic Analysis  ap. 3496-3510.  aIn the momentum of reducing the CO₂ emission of coal to ethylene glycol (CtEG) process, a novel carbon dioxide utilized coal to ethylene glycol (CUCtEG) process is proposed, simulated, and optimized to find the optimal way for simultaneous reduction and utilization of CO₂ emissions of conventional coal to ethylene glycol process. The novel process is integrated with coke oven gas and dry/steam-mixed methane reforming technologies to enhance resource and energy efficiencies as well as reduce CO₂ emission. On the basis of the rigorous steady-state simulation of the process, the key operational parameters of the proposed process are investigated and optimized. A detailed technoeconomic analysis is conducted to manifest the advantages of the proposed process by comparison with a conventional process. The results show that the optimal feed ratio of coke oven gas to coal is 0.68, and the split ratio of CH₄ for steam methane reforming reaction is suggested to be 0.74. Compared with the conventional coal to ethylene glycol process, the direct CO₂ emission of the proposed process is significantly reduced by 94.05%, and the carbon utilization efficiency and exergy efficiency are greatly increased by 36.4% and 15.17%. Moreover, the proposed process has a better economic performance and stronger competitiveness since it can save the production cost by 9.72% and improve the internal rate of return by 6.92%. Thus, the proposed process provides a promising way to efficient utilization of CO₂ and improve the technoeconomic performance of coal to ethylene glycol industry.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3acarbon dioxide 3acoal 3aeconomic performance 3aenergy efficiency 3aethylene glycol 3aexergy 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3aindustry 3amethane 3amomentum 3aovens 3asteam 0aCoal to ethylene glycol 0aCO2 utilization 0aTechnoeconomic analysis 0aCoke oven gas 0aCleaner production1 aLiu, Xing1 aZhu, Shun1 aHuang, Weiqing1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3559-34461 aZhang, Dawei1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2842-92770 tACS sustainable chemistry & engineering.g2019 Jan. 11, v. 7, no. 3 p.3496-3510dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23317x2168-04857nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acssuschemeng.8b057573Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02413naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001800139245005800157300001800215520123900233592002801472650001001500650001201510650001601522650001101538650001101549650000901560650001901569650001301588650002601601650001201627650001301639650001201652650002001664650001601684700001701700700001701717700001601734700001801750773012901768856007301897852000901970655001201979IND60518986720221121054557.0160419e201605  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051898672DNAL7 a10.1002/jsfa.73512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Xinyan10aEffects of temperature on the quality of black garlic  ap. 2366-2372.  aBACKGROUND: Black garlic is a type of garlic product that is generally produced by heating raw garlic at high temperature with controlled humidity for more than 30 days. Black garlic has appeared on the market for many years. It is crucial to investigate the characteristics of quality formation of black garlic during processing at various temperatures. RESULTS: In this study, fresh garlic was processed to black garlic at temperatures of 60, 70, 80 and 90 °C. Moisture, amino acid nitrogen and allicin contents decreased gradually during thermal processing of various temperatures. Reducing sugar, 5‐hydroxymethylfurfural, total phenols, total acids contents and browning increased. The changing rate of quality indicators and flavour of black garlic varied at different temperatures. Browning intensity reached about 74 when black garlic aged. The sensory score was significantly higher in black garlic aged at 70 °C (39.95 ± 0.31) compared with that at other temperatures, suggesting that 70 °C might facilitate formation of good quality and flavour of black garlic during processing. CONCLUSION: Temperature had a remarkable impact on the quality and flavour of black garlic. © 2015 Society of Chemical Industry  aPublisher supplied data 3aacids 3aallicin 3aamino acids 3aflavor 3agarlic 3aheat 3aheat treatment 3ahumidity 3ahydroxymethylfurfural 3amarkets 3anitrogen 3aphenols 3areducing sugars 3atemperature1 aLi, Ningyang1 aLu, Xiaoming1 aLiu, Pengli1 aQiao, Xuguang0 tJournal of the science of food and agriculture.g2016 May, v. 96, no. 7 p.2366-2372dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx0022-51427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jsfa.73513Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02465naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245009600171300001400267520124600281592002801527650002501555650002101580650002601601650001501627650001201642650002301654653002401677653002801701653003201729653002601761653001601787653001801803700002001821700001901841773012601860856008401986852000902070655001202079IND60121943420221120170430.0150325e20130301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012194342DNAL7 a10.1080/21606544.2012.7546122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAhlheim, Michael14aThe effects of extrinsic incentives on respondent behaviour in contingent valuation studies  ap. 45-70.  aIn contingent valuation studies to assess the economic value of environmental goods, respondents are often given small presents or money amounts at the beginning of the interview to compensate them for their time spent on the survey and to encourage them to be conscientious when answering the questions. Yet, it is still an open question whether this practice biases contingent valuation survey responses, especially stated willingness to pay (WTP) for the respective environmental good. This study employs a set of field experiments to investigate the effect of respondent incentives in the form of monetary and in-kind gifts on responses in a contingent valuation survey. It is analysed how these different kinds of incentives affect (1) respondents’ diligence when answering contingent valuation method questions, (2) the likelihood of a respondent to state a positive WTP and (3) the amount of stated WTP. Results show that with respect to raising respondents' diligence in the survey interview, a moderate monetary incentive is most effective. The results regarding the effect on WTP statements are less clear. While the likelihood to state a positive WTP is increased by most incentives, mean WTP estimates are virtually unaffected.  aPublisher supplied data 3acontingent valuation 3aecological value 3afield experimentation 3ainterviews 3asurveys 3awillingness to pay 0apublic expenditures 0aenvironmental valuation 0acontingent valuation method 0arespondent incentives 0areciprocity 0areforestation1 aBörger, Tobias1 aFrör, Oliver,0 tJournal of environmental economics and policy.g2013 Mar. 1, v. 2, no. 1 p.45-70dTaylor & Francis Groupx2160-65527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/21606544.2012.7546123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02909naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002900144245009200173300001600265500002000281520144400301592002801745650001901773650002501792650001101817650001101828650001601839650002701855650001201882650001901894650001501913650002501928650001601953650002001969650001201989650001502001650001602016650001102032651002102043651001502064700003202079700003102111700004202142700003302184773011102217856007802328852000902406655001202415IND60571728120221119162603.0170712e201706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057172812DNAL7 a10.1002/jobm.2017000212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMartorell, María Martha10aBioprospection of cold‐adapted yeasts with biotechnological potential from Antarctica  ap. 504-516.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe aim of this study was to investigate the ability to produce extracellular hydrolytic enzymes at low temperature of yeasts isolated from 25 de Mayo island, Antarctica, and to identify those exhibiting one or more of the evaluated enzymatic activities. A total of 105 yeast isolates were obtained from different samples and 66 were identified. They belonged to 12 basidiomycetous and four ascomycetous genera. Most of the isolates were ascribed to the genera Cryptococcus, Mrakia, Cystobasidium, Rhodotorula, Gueomyces, Phenoliferia, Leucosporidium, and Pichia. Results from enzymes production at low temperatures revealed that the Antarctic environment contains metabolically diverse cultivable yeasts, which represent potential tools for biotechnological applications. While most the isolates proved to produce 2‐4 of the investigated exoenzymes, two of them evidenced the six evaluated enzymatic activities: Pichia caribbica and Guehomyces pullulans, which were characterized as psycrotolerant and psycrophilic, respectively. In addition, P. caribbica could assimilate several n‐alkanes and diesel fuel. The enzyme production profile and hydrocarbons assimilation capacity, combined with its high level of biomass production and the extended exponential growth phase make P. caribbica a promising tool for cold environments biotechnological purposes in the field of cold‐enzymes production and oil spills bioremediation as well.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLeucosporidium 3aMeyerozyma caribbica 3aMrakia 3aPichia 3aRhodotorula 3aTrichosporon pullulans 3aalkanes 3abioremediation 3acold zones 3adevelopmental stages 3adiesel fuel 3aenzyme activity 3aenzymes 3aoil spills 3atemperature 3ayeasts 3aAntarctic region 3aAntarctica1 aRuberto, Lucas Adolfo Mauro1 aFernández, Pablo Marcelo,1 aCastellanos de Figueroa, Lucía Inés1 aMac Cormack, Walter Patricio0 tJournal of basic microbiology.g2017 June, v. 57, no. 6 p.504-516dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx0233-111X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jobm.2017000213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03361naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002800148245013900176300001200315520191400327592002802241650001402269650001802283650002702301650001402328650001602342650001202358650001602370650001502386650001702401650001402418650001002432650001502442650001502457650002002472650000902492700002202501700002102523700001902544700002402563700002002587700002102607700002602628773013302654856008302787852000902870655001202879IND60781293220221116162012.0220813e202208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078129322DNAL7 a10.1007/s11250-022-03218-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJiwuba, Peter-Damian C.10aHaematology and serum biochemistry of West African Dwarf goats fed Pleurotus tuber-regium–treated cassava root sievate–based diets  ap. 217.  aThe study aimed at determining the effect of Pleurotus tuber-regium–treated cassava root sievate–based diets on haematology and serum biochemistry of West African Dwarf (WAD) goats. Thirty-two WAD goats between 6 and 8 months old were randomly divided into four groups of eight goats each. The four experimental diets were formulated to contain 0, 20, 40 and 60% dietary levels of inclusion of Pleurotus tuber-regium–treated cassava root sievate, respectively. The groups were randomly assigned to the four experiment diets (T₁, T₂, T₃ and T₄) for 90 days in a completely randomized design. At the start of the experiment, packed cell volume (PCV) ranged from 24.90 to 29.49% and red blood cell (RBC) 9.42–10.44 × 10 12/L while mean cell haemoglobin significantly (p < 0.05) ranged from 5.44 to 6.41 pg. At the end of the experiment, PCV and RBC showed significant differences (p < 0.05) and were better in T₂. At the start of the experiment, cholesterol ranged from 2.15 to 2.29 mmol/l, creatinine from 75.72 to 80.32 μmol/l, urea from 16.39 to 16.72 mg/dl, total bilirubin from 0.25 to 0.28 μmol/l, total protein from 61.73 to 63.16 g/I, globulin from 29.08 to 29.59 g/I and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) from 68.62 to 71.06 U/L. At the end of the trial, cholesterol values were significantly (p < 0.05) higher in T₁. Urea was significantly reduced (p < 0.05) with T₁ showing significantly higher values than T₃ and T₄. Total protein, globulin and total bilirubin increased (p < 0.05) linearly from T₁ to T₄. AST was improved (p < 0.05) at the end of the study. The study revealed that the inclusion of Pleurotus tuber-regium-degraded cassava root sievate in the diets of West African Dwarf goats had no deleterious effects on the haematological and serum biochemical parameters of goats and could be included in goat diets up to 60%.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPleurotus 3aanimal health 3aaspartate transaminase 3abilirubin 3ablood serum 3acassava 3acholesterol 3acreatinine 3aerythrocytes 3aglobulins 3agoats 3ahematology 3ahemoglobin 3aprotein content 3aurea1 aIkwunze, Kingsley1 aJiwuba, Lydia C.1 aOkoye, Levi E.1 aAmaduruonye, Wisdom1 aIlo, Stanley U.1 aOkah, Uchechukwu1 aAhamefule, Francis O.0 tTropical animal health and production.g2022 Aug., v. 54, no. 4 p.217-217dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl706x0049-47477nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11250-022-03218-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02189naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002400150245013000174300001800304520110900322592002801431650002201459650001901481650001901500650001501519650001401534650003701548700002701585700003501612700002201647773009901669856008601768852000901854655001201863IND60577670520221120153134.0170810e20170620xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057767052DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.langmuir.7b004832doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aThangasamy, Pitchai10aEnhanced Superhydrophobic Performance of BN-MoS2 Heterostructure Prepared via a Rapid, One-Pot Supercritical Fluid Processing  ap. 6159-6166.  aFabrication of highly crystalline BN-MoS₂ heterostructure with >95% yield was demonstrated using one-pot supercritical fluid processing within 30 min. The existence of 20–50 layers of BN-MoS₂ in the prepared heterostructure was confirmed by AFM analysis. The HR-TEM imaging and mapping analysis revealed the well-melded BN and MoS₂ nanosheets in the heterostructure. The drastic reduction in XRD line intensities corresponding to the (002) plane and broadening of the peaks for the BN system over MoS₂ indicated the effective exfoliation and lateral size reduction in BN nanosheets during SCF processing. Also, the exfoliated MoS₂ nanosheets are preferentially exposed rather than BN nanosheets; consequently, the MoS₂ nanosheets sturdily covered BN nanosheets in the heterostructure. The exfoliated BN and MoS₂ nanosheets with nanoscale roughness make the surface highly hydrophobic in nature. As a result, the BN-MoS₂ heterostructure showed superior superhydrophobic performance with high water contact angle of 165.9°, which is much higher than the value reported in the literature.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3ahydrophobicity 3aimage analysis 3ananosheets 3aroughness 3atransmission electron microscopy1 aPartheeban, Thamodaran1 aSudanthiramoorthy, Subramanian1 aSathish, Marappan0 tLangmuir.g2017 June 20, v. 33, no. 24 p.6159-6166dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.langmuir.7b004833Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03224naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245014900169300001800318520133100336592002801667650002201695650002501717650002501742650002701767650002001794650001101814650001301825650001001838650002001848650001501868650002801883650001601911650002701927650004301954650001901997650001102016650002302027650001002050650002102060650002202081650002602103650000902129650002502138650001502163700002102178700003502199700002402234700002602258700002602284700003202310700002502342700001902367700003102386773010302417856008102520852000902601655001202610IND60086497020221120103222.0141101e201212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008649702DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fct.2012.08.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrito, Naira J.N.10aAntioxidant activity and protective effect of Turnera ulmifolia Linn. var. elegans against carbon tetrachloride-induced oxidative damage in rats  ap. 4340-4347.  aThe present study aimed to determine whether the leaves of Turnera ulmifolia Linn. var. elegans extract exert significant antioxidant activity. The antioxidant activity of its hydroethanolic extract (HEETU) was evaluated by assessing (a) its radical scavenging ability in vitro, and (b) its in vivo effect on lipid peroxidation and antioxidant enzyme activities. The in vitro antioxidant assay (DPPH) clearly supported HEETU free radical scavenging potential. Moreover, glutathione content and antioxidant enzyme activities (glutathione peroxidase, superoxide dismutase and catalase) were significantly enhanced in CCl₄-treated rats due to oral HEETU-treatment (500mg/kgb.w.) over 7 and 21days. In addition, an improvement was observed in lipid peroxidation and serum biochemical parameters (aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase), indicating a protective effect against CCl₄-induced liver injuries, confirmed by histopathological studies. The HEETU effect was comparable to the standard drug Legalon® (50mg/kgb.w.) under the same experimental condition. Quantitative analysis of the HPLC extract revealed the presence of flavonoids, wich mediate the effects of antioxidant and oxidative stress. In conclusion, extract components exhibit antioxidant and hepatoprotective activities in vitro and in vivo.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTurnera ulmifolia 3aalanine transaminase 3aantioxidant activity 3aaspartate transaminase 3ablood chemistry 3acarbon 3acatalase 3adrugs 3aenzyme activity 3aflavonoids 3afree radical scavengers 3aglutathione 3aglutathione peroxidase 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3ahistopathology 3aleaves 3alipid peroxidation 3aliver 3aoxidative stress 3aprotective effect 3aquantitative analysis 3arats 3asuperoxide dismutase 3atoxicology1 aLópez, Jorge A.1 aNascimento, Maria Aparecida do1 aMacêdo, José B.M.1 aSilva, Gabriel Araujo1 aOliveira, Cláudia N.1 ade Rezende, Adriana Augusto1 aBrandão-Neto, José1 aSchwarz, Aline1 aAlmeida, Maria das Graças0 tFood and chemical toxicology.g2012 Dec., v. 50, no. 12 p.4340-4347dElsevier Ltdx0278-69157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fct.2012.08.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02856naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245011200168300001800280520158100298592002801879650001901907650002601926650001401952650002201966650001401988650001402002650001702016650001002033650001902043650001702062650002502079650001602104650002602120700002102146700002202167700002202189773014302211856008302354852000902437655001202446IND60675866020221119120422.0191213e201912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067586602DNAL7 a10.1007/s00217-019-03392-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCebulak, Tomasz10aEffect of abiotic stress factors on polyphenolic content in the skin and flesh of pear by UPLC-PDA-Q/TOF-MS  ap. 2715-2725.  aGrowing social interest in foods with high biological quality results in the need to look for possibilities of increasing the biological quality of food products. The aim of this research was an attempt to estimate the increase of polyphenolic compounds (by UPLC-PDA-MS/MS) in the flesh and skin of pear under the influence of stress elicitors such as UVC radiation, L-EMF, H-EMF and US with various exposure times. The applied stress factors differentiated the content of phenolic acids, flavan-3-ols and flavonols both in flesh and in skin. In all cases, pear skin demonstrated a decrease in the sum of polyphenolic compounds; however, when it comes to flavan-3-ols and procyanidins, the concentration of the compounds increased in two cases: after a 30-min exposure to L-EMF (+ 18%) and after a 5-min exposure to H-EMF (+ 20%). Following a 30-min flesh exposure to US, the determined sum of polyphenolic compounds was + 28% higher than in the control sample. It was observed that the level of flavan-3-ols and procyanidins in the flesh increased after a 60-min exposure to UVC radiation and low-frequency and high-frequency electromagnetic fields, and after a 20-min and 30-min exposure to ultrasounds. The presence of flavonols was only observed in pear skin. The research results show that it is possible to produce juice with a higher content of polyphenolic compounds, because juice is obtained mainly from the flesh; however, there is a need for further research to confirm the observed tendencies in the changes of polyphenolic compounds in fractions of pears.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabiotic stress 3aelectromagnetic field 3aelicitors 3aexposure duration 3aflavanols 3aflavonols 3afruit juices 3apears 3aphenolic acids 3aprocyanidins 3aultrasonic treatment 3aultrasonics 3aultraviolet radiation1 aOszmiański, Jan1 aKapusta, Ireneusz1 aLachowicz, Sabina0 tEuropean food research & technology.g2019 Dec., v. 245, no. 12 p.2715-2725dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl58946x1438-23777nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00217-019-03392-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02737naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001700155245010900172520154900281592002801830650001801858650001501876650001501891650001701906650001001923650002101933650001001954650001401964650001501978653001801993653002702011653001402038653002502052700001602077700002302093700002802116773009602144856009002240852000902330655001202339IND60684018920221118123001.0200405e202005  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068401892DNAL7 a10.1016/j.actatropica.2020.1053782doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aItō, Akira,10aKozen Yoshino's experimental infections with Taenia solium tapeworms: An experiment never to be repeated  aIn the 1930′s Kozen Yoshino published 6 papers on Taenia solium. One of these papers is particularly important because it describes the outcomes of experimental infections with T. solium tapeworms in four volunteers, Yoshino being one of them. The paper was written in an old form of the Japanese language, making it almost inaccessible to most researchers around the world. Here we provide a non-literal translation of this work and some brief comments by the translators. Each of the four volunteers swallowed three or five cysticerci recovered from an experimentally infected pig. Each person was found to have harbored 2 – 5 tapeworms when the infections were terminated by drug treatment between 120 and 451 days after infection. The pre-patent period recorded by Yoshino's volunteers was between 62 and 72 days based on the first appearance of gravid proglottids (GPs) in the feces. In one subject, the number of GPs appearing in each bowel movement was tracked daily for 371 days following the first appearance of GPs in the feces, together with the number of bowel movements each day. GPs were observed on 275 of the 284 days on which the subject defecated during which observations were made. There was a decline in the number of GPs over the observation period; proglottids were observed on 97% of all days on which defecation occurred, they were present on 87% of days in the last month of infection. The cumulative number of GPs for a month in the 1st, 6th and 12th months of patent infection was 334, 174 and 126, respectively.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTaenia solium 3acysticerci 3adefecation 3adrug therapy 3afeces 3aprepatent period 3aswine 3atapeworms 3avolunteers 0aKozen Yoshino 0aExperimental infection 0aTaeniasis 0aProglottid's outcome1 aSaito, Mika1 aDonadeu, Meritxell1 aLightowlers, Marshall W0 tActa tropica.g2020 May, v. 205 p.105378-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl44799x0001-706X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.actatropica.2020.1053783Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02962naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245009300169300001500262520173200277592002802009650002602037650002502063650002202088650002402110650002202134650001402156650001102170650001802181650001202199653003002211653003402241653001802275653001102293653001502304653002502319773012702344856008402471852000902555655001202564IND60121943620221122014327.0150325e20130301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012194362DNAL7 a10.1080/21606544.2013.7646162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCole, Scott G.10aEquity over efficiency: a problem of credibility in scaling resource-based compensation?  ap. 93-117.  aResource-based compensation aims to offset the public's welfare loss associated with environmental or resource injuries. Compensatory payments are frequently scaled using Equivalency Analysis (EA). EA's focus on ensuring equity in utility terms for the victim may lead to an inefficient outcome for society as it fails to incorporate the social opportunity cost of the compensatory payment. An alternative scaling approach based on Cost–Benefit Analysis (CBA) may better address the trade-offs facing society by considering the social marginal benefits of additional compensation, which may be a function of the cost of provision and the quality or quantity of existing resources. A simple numerical model illustrates differences in scaling approaches and underlying assumptions. In contrast to EA, CBA suggests that the optimal compensatory payment may be positive, zero or negative (i.e. additional damage should be allowed). EA need not lead to a decline in welfare if the environmental injury or the costs of compensation are marginal, or if policy makers have a particular welfare function in mind vis-a-vis the polluter. The lack of credible methods for pricing non-market resources may lead to a preference by policy makers for the equity-focused EA approach rather than one aiming for socially efficient outcomes. Both methods require inevitable value judgments to determine whether society is, in fact, ‘no worse off’ after compensation has been paid. EA seems in conflict with governments’ otherwise increasing, but still limited use of environmental CBA to direct scarce conservation resources – in this case, collected from the polluter on the public's behalf – to a variety of environmental challenges.  aPublisher supplied data 3acost benefit analysis 3aenvironmental impact 3aissues and policy 3amathematical models 3aopportunity costs 3apollution 3aprices 3asocial impact 3asociety 0aequivalency analysis (EA) 0acost–benefit analysis (CBA) 0ainterim loss; 0aequity 0aefficiency 0asocial profitability0 tJournal of environmental economics and policy.g2013 Mar. 1, v. 2, no. 1 p.93-117dTaylor & Francis Groupx2160-65527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/21606544.2013.7646163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02751naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100005100145245008600196300001800282500001900300520127500319592002801594650003001622650002101652650001501673650001701688650001401705650002201719650000901741650001801750650001301768650001401781650000701795650001401802650002001816700007601836700006001912700005901972700005902031773013902090856007902229852000902308655001202317IND60681893720221117233552.0200121e20191220xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068189372DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.est.9b039752doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHe, Jie1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9103-098210aProduction of a Surface-Localized Oxidant during Oxygenation of Mackinawite (FeS)  ap. 1167-1176.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe oxygenation of mackinawite (FeS) frequently occurs at anoxic–oxic interfaces in both natural and engineered systems such as intertidal sediment, in activated sludge in water treatment processes, and during sulfidized zero-valent iron particle corrosion. During reoxygenation events, FeS may drive a Fenton-like process leading to the production of strong oxidants though the details of this process are poorly understood. In this study, benzoic acid (BA) has been used to probe both the magnitude and identity of these strong oxidants under circumneutral pH conditions. The major product of BA oxidation during FeS oxygenation was found to be 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid (2,5-DHBA) rather than monohydroxybenzoic acids identified to be the major products in a range of hydroxyl radical (HO·)-dominated systems. Based upon relative reactivity with other competitive probes and nature of the hydroxybenzoate product distribution, it is hypothesized that the strong oxidant must be a surface-localized entity such as high-valent iron or surface-associated hydroxyl or sulfur-based radicals with reactivity differing from those formed in free solution. The importance of both the reactivity of the oxidant and adsorption of the substrate to the surface is demonstrated.  aPublisher supplied data 3a2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid 3aactivated sludge 3aadsorption 3abenzoic acid 3acorrosion 3ahydroxyl radicals 3airon 3alittoral zone 3aoxidants 3aoxidation 3apH 3asediments 3awater treatment1 aMiller, C.

This review aims to summarize the key research progress acquired during the last decade regarding the understanding of MICC reaction mechanisms and the development of durable materials from an interdisciplinary perspective. Special focus was laid on aspects governing concrete - micoorganisms interaction since being the central process steering biogenic acid corrosion. The insufficient knowledge regarding the latter is proposed as a central reason for insufficient progress in tailored material development for aggressive wastewater systems. To date no cement-based material exists, suitable to withstand the aggressive conditions related to MICC over its entire service life. Research is in particular needed on the impact of physiochemical material parameters on microbial community structure, growth characteristics and limitations within individual concrete speciation. Herein an interdisciplinary approach is presented by combining results from material sciences, microbiology, mineralogy and hydrochemistry to stimulate the development of novel and sustainable materials and mitigation strategies for MICC. For instance, the application of antibacteriostatic agents is introduced as an effective instrument to limit microbial growth on concrete surfaces in aggressive sewer environments. Additionally, geopolymer concretes are introduced as highly resistent in acid environments, thus representing a possible green alternative to conventional cement-based construction materials.  aPublisher supplied data 3acommunity structure 3aconcrete 3aconstruction materials 3acorrosion 3adurability 3ahydrochemistry 3ainfrastructure 3amicrobial communities 3amicrobial growth 3amineralogy 3apolymers 3areaction mechanisms 3asewer systems 3awastewater 0aSustainable construction 0aMicrobiological corrosion 0aConcrete 0aMicroorganism interactions 0aGeopolymers 0aAntimicrobial agents 0aAcid corrosion1 aMittermayr, Florian1 aUkrainczyk, Neven1 aKoraimann, Günther1 aKienesberger, Sabine1 aDietzel, Martin0 tWater research.g2018 May 01, v. 134 p.341-352dElsevier LtdwJournal:1966x0043-13547nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2018.01.0433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03623naa a2200649 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001900144245008900163300001600252500002000268520182900288592002802117650001802145650001402163650001902177650001702196650001902213650001702232650001902249650001602268650001702284650001702301650001702318650001102335650001302346650002602359650002402385650001402409650001502423650001002438650004202448650002202490650001102512650000702523650001802530650001302548650001302561650001402574650002202588650002502610650001302635650001302648651001702661651001502678700001902693700001802712700001602730700001702746773011102763856007802874852000902952655001202961IND60571728320221119162430.0170712e201706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057172832DNAL7 a10.1002/jobm.2017000412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Hongxia10aSpatial variation in bacterial community in natural wetland‐river‐sea ecosystems  ap. 536-546.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aWetland‐estuarine‐marine environments are typical oxic/anoxic transition zones and have complex water flow‐paths within the zone of mixing where freshwater interacts with ocean water. Little is known about the impact of this interaction on bacterial community structures or the relationship between bacterial community and geochemical factors in such transitional mixing environments. Hence, we investigated the distribution patterns and diversity in bacterial communities in the Yellow River estuary‐coastal wetland‐Bohai Sea transition zone by analyzing 39 samples from 13 ordered sites. High‐throughput sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene revealed significant shifts in diversity and distribution of bacterial community in sediments from the Yellow River estuary to the Bohai Sea. Yellow River sediment was dominated by hydrogen‐, nitrogen‐, and iron‐cycling bacteria, such as Hydrogenophaga, Nitrospira, Pseudomonas, and Thiobacillus. The coastal wetland had a haloduric community associated with different functions, such as Planctomyces, Marinobacter, Halomonas, Salinivibrio, and Salinibacter. The Bohai Sea sediment had a higher relative abundance of Lutimonas, Desulfococcus, Photobacterium, Propionigenium, and Vibrio. Spatial variation in bacterial community was correlated with pH, salinity and sulfate (SO42−) concentration in such coastal environments. The major bacterial taxa were significantly different across the wetland, estuary, and coastal marine ecosystems, indicating substantial spatial heterogeneity among the three ecosystems. Statistical analysis revealed strong links between variation in bacterial community structure and ecosystem type. Our results demonstrate the importance of geographic and geochemical factors in structuring the bacterial community in natural environments.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDesulfococcus 3aHalomonas 3aHydrogenophaga 3aMarinobacter 3aPhotobacterium 3aPlanctomyces 3aPropionigenium 3aPseudomonas 3aSalinibacter 3aSalinivibrio 3aThiobacillus 3aVibrio 3abacteria 3abacterial communities 3acommunity structure 3aestuaries 3afreshwater 3agenes 3ahigh-throughput nucleotide sequencing 3amarine ecosystems 3amixing 3apH 3aribosomal RNA 3asalinity 3aseawater 3asediments 3aspatial variation 3astatistical analysis 3asulfates 3awetlands 3aYellow River 3aYellow Sea1 aZheng, Shiling1 aDing, Jiawang1 aWang, Oumei1 aLiu, Fanghua0 tJournal of basic microbiology.g2017 June, v. 57, no. 6 p.536-546dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx0233-111X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jobm.2017000413Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01506naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002400140245007900164300001800243520048000261592002800741650002300769650002300792650001200815700002200827700002200849700002800871700002100899700002500920700001900945773013300964856007401097852000901171655001201180IND60655980120221121083846.0190808e20190807xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065598012DNAL7 a10.1039/c9cc05002g2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLorzing, Gregory R.10aDesign and synthesis of capped-paddlewheel-based porous coordination cages  ap. 9527-9530.  aTo leverage the structural diversity of metal–organic frameworks, the ability to controllably terminate them for the isolation of porous coordination cages is advantageous.

In Finland, thousands of inland lakes serve a very rich and important environment for many activities and a number of ecosystem services. These services can be threatened due to other human activities but also for natural reasons. The natural fluctuation of water level in Lake Pielinen, the largest non-regulated lake in Finland, damages occupational, recreational and housing possibilities. This paper focuses on the examination of the local households’ attitudes, opinions and willingness to pay (WTP) for water level regulation at optimum level for recreational purposes in the summertime. The related economic benefits are analysed by applying the contingent valuation (CV) method. The logistic regression model and a variant of the Tobit model are used in the econometric analyses. The results show that WTP increases with higher income, youth, living near the shore, having a boat, being aware of the regulation plans and having no difficulties with the questions. The aggregate WTP of the local population is approximately EUR 0.24–0.44 million. The attitudinal results reveal a strong local interest in the regulation of Lake Pielinen.  aPublisher supplied data 3acontingent valuation 3ahouseholds 3aattitudes and opinions 3aincome 3ahumans 3alakes 3aecosystem services 3amodels 3asurface water level 3aregression analysis 3asummer 3awillingness to pay 3aboats 3ayouth 3aeconometrics 3aboating 3aFinland 0aoutdoor recreation 0aeconomic valuation 0aTobit model for grouped data 0awater levels 0awatercourse regulation1 aSeppälä, Elina,1 aKosenius, Anna-Kaisa0 tJournal of environmental economics and policy.g2013 July 1, v. 2, no. 2 p.148-163dTaylor & Francis Groupx2160-65527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/21606544.2013.7646153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02592naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001700152245015000169520111300319592002801432650002301460650002801483650003901511650001301550650001301563650001601576650002701592650001401619650001701633650001701650650001901667650000901686650003101695650002101726653003201747653003101779653002601810653002401836700001401860700001701874700001901891700001701910773009901927856008702026852000902113655001202122IND60678502420221120043910.0200217e20200501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067850242DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2019.1259322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZheng, Yimei10aEffects of microwave-vacuum pre-treatment with different power levels on the structural and emulsifying properties of lotus seed protein isolates  aThe present study investigated the changes in structural and emulsifying properties of lotus seed protein isolates (LSPIs) under different microwave-vacuum (MV) treatments. A decrease of fluorescence peak intensity with blue-shift of the fluorescence emission maximum indicated that MV treatment induced unfolding of LSPIs so that more hydrophobic residues were exposed. Raman spectra showed that the ordered secondary structures (α-helix, β-sheet) gradually converted into β-turns and random coils during 50–150 W MV treatment. Particle size distribution and atomic force microscope revealed that the amounts of small subunits increased when the LSPIs were modified by 50–100 W MV treatment. Emulsions prepared by 100-W-MV-LSPIs exhibited the optimal emulsifying ability with the smallest oil droplet sizes. Confocal laser scanning microscopy and analytical centrifugal analyzer further proved 50–100 W MV-treatment enhanced the flocculation and creaming stability. Our findings provide a certain theoretical foundation to apply MV technology for developing desirable LSPIs-stabilized emulsions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRaman spectroscopy 3aatomic force microscopy 3aconfocal laser scanning microscopy 3acreaming 3adroplets 3aemulsifying 3aemulsifying properties 3aemulsions 3aflocculation 3afluorescence 3ahydrophobicity 3aoils 3aparticle size distribution 3aprotein isolates 0aLotus seed protein isolates 0aMicrowave-vacuum treatment 0aStructural properties 0aEmulsifying ability1 aLi, Zhiyu1 aZhang, Chong1 aZheng, Baodong1 aTian, Yuting0 tFood chemistry.g2020 May 01, v. 311 p.125932-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8139x0308-81467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2019.1259323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02570naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001600144245012500160300001600285500002000301520120300321592002801524650001801552650002401570650002601594650001901620650001801639650001801657650001501675650001201690650001501702650000901717650001001726650001401736650002201750650001301772650005801785650002201843700001701865700001701882700001501899773011101914856007802025852000902103655001202112IND60571728520221119162555.0170712e201706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057172852DNAL7 a10.1002/jobm.2016006922doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRyu, Jaewon10aStructural analysis and enhanced production of fusaricidin from Paenibacillus kribbensis CU01 isolated from yellow loess  ap. 525-535.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aA bacterial strain showing strong antifungal activity was isolated from yellow loess and was identified as Paenibacillus kribbensis CU01. Insoluble mucoidal polymers were separated from M9 culture medium via low‐speed centrifugation. Most antifungal activity was associated with substances in the insoluble precipitate, which was purified by reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography. Purified fractions were analyzed using matrix‐assisted laser desorption/ionization time‐of‐flight/time‐of‐flight mass spectrometry. Two major ion peaks with mass‐to‐charge ratio values (m/z) at 883.6 and 897.6 were revealed. After alkaline hydrolysis and sequence analysis, two cyclic depsipeptides were identified as, fusaricidin A and fusaricidin B. Their production was significantly increased by the addition of glucose, Fe²⁺, and Mn²⁺ to M9 medium. Maximum concentrations of produced fusaricidin A and fusaricidin B at flask‐scale comprised 460 mg L⁻¹ and 118 mg L⁻¹, respectively: the highest production concentrations yet reported in the literature. This demonstrates that P. kribbensis CU01 has enormous commercial potential for the mass production of fusaricidin.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPaenibacillus 3aalkaline hydrolysis 3aantifungal properties 3acentrifugation 3aculture media 3adepsipeptides 3adesorption 3aglucose 3aionization 3airon 3aloess 3amanganese 3amass spectrometry 3apolymers 3areversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography 3asequence analysis1 aKim, Jong M.1 aLee, Chul W.1 aKim, Si W.0 tJournal of basic microbiology.g2017 June, v. 57, no. 6 p.525-535dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx0233-111X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jobm.2016006923Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03091naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005600148245026400204300001200468520177300480592002802253650001502281650000802296650001402304650001702318650001102335650001902346650001902365650001202384650002302396650001602419650001502435650002002450700001502470773014102485856008202626852000902708655001202717IND60781293620221116162002.0220811e202207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078129362DNAL7 a10.1007/s11270-022-05739-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDuan, Runbin1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1187-929510aTransport Behavior of Cu2+ Under Binary and Multi-Component Systems in the Columns of Polyaluminium Chloride and Anionic Polyacrylamide Water Treatment Residuals: Implication for Reuse in Stormwater Bioretention Systems [Erratum: August 2022, v.233(8); p.348]  ap. 253.  aThe lack of information from column studies of Cu²⁺ transport in polyaluminium chloride and anionic polyacrylamide water treatment residuals (PAC-APAM WTRs) has been hampering their reuse as a media in stormwater bioretention systems. The transport behavior of inactive tracer Br⁻ and Cu²⁺ in various systems with and without the presence of Pb²⁺, Cd²⁺, and Zn²⁺ was investigated in the columns of PAC-APAM WTRs under saturated steady flow conditions. Modeling Br⁻ breakthrough curves (BTCs) using CXTFIT revealed that the transport of a solute in the columns was an equilibrium process almost without stagnant water, with all active sites on PAC-APAM WTRs being instantaneously available for the adsorption reaction during transport (βₚ = 0.99 and ωL = 100). The results of modeling Cu²⁺ BTCs with HYDRUS-1D showed that the chemical non-equilibrium two-site model (R² 0.8911–0.9999; RMSE 0.00–0.05) described the experimental data of Cu²⁺ better than the equilibrium convection–dispersion model using the linear isotherm (R² 0.4877–0.9901; RMSE 0.02–0.12) and the Langmuir isotherm (R² 0.7083–0.9938; RMSE 0.01–0.10). The fraction of instantaneous adsorption sites at the equilibrium (fₑ) of Cu²⁺ decreased with the increase of co-existing heavy metal ions from 0.27 (monocomponent system) to 0.06 (quaternary system) due to competitive adsorption with the Cu²⁺, Cd²⁺, and Zn²⁺ systems as an exception. The first kinetic rate (ω) of Cu²⁺ increased with the increase of competitive heavy metal ions from 0.0076 (monocomponent system) to 0.0410 (quaternary system). This research could contribute to the understanding of Cu²⁺ transport and potential leaching in stormwater bioretention systems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3aair 3achlorides 3aheavy metals 3amodels 3apolyacrylamide 3asoil pollution 3asolutes 3asorption isotherms 3asteady flow 3astormwater 3awater treatment1 aChen, Jing0 tWater, air, and soil pollution.g2022 July, v. 233, no. 7 p.253-253dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl4876x0049-69797nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11270-022-05739-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02483naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245009300164300001800257520124800275592002801523650001601551650001501567650003601582650001901618650002001637650001701657650002801674650001401702650001001716650000901726650001201735650001501747650001301762650001501775650001401790700001801804700001701822700001701839773010301856856008101959852000902040655001202049IND60086497420221120103411.0141101e201212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008649742DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fct.2012.08.0452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKumar, Manoj10aModulation of CYP1A1, CYP1B1 and DNA adducts level by green and white tea in Balb/c mice  ap. 4375-4381.  aIn the current investigation the ameliorative effect of 2% extract of green tea (GT) and white tea (WT) against benzo(a)pyrene (BaP) induced toxicity and DNA damage has been studied in liver and lung of Balb/c mice (8 animals per group). The activities of phase I enzymes such as 7-ethoxyresorufin O-deethylase (EROD) and pentoxyresorufin O-depentylase (PROD) were found to be increased (p<0.05) both in liver and lung of BaP treated (125mg/kg b.w. orally) group. The enhanced activities of EROD and PROD were inhibited in group that received pretreatment with GT and WT for 35days. Pretreatment with GT and WT also elevated (p<0.05) the level of detoxifying enzymes such as glutathione S-transferase (GST) and quinone reductase (QR) in both the tissues. The BaPDE–DNA adducts level reflected the decreasing pattern from BaP treated group to the groups that received pretreatment with GT and WT. BaP exposure induced drastic alterations in the morphology of erythrocytes, pretreatment of GT and WT to BaP administered groups showed reduced alteration in topography of erythrocytes. WT elucidate greater efficacy in ameliorating BaP toxicity, but further long term studies are required to validate white tea as a cancer chemopreventive agent.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA adducts 3aDNA damage 3aNAD(P)H dehydrogenase (quinone) 3abenzo(a)pyrene 3achemoprevention 3aerythrocytes 3aglutathione transferase 3agreen tea 3aliver 3amice 3atissues 3atopography 3atoxicity 3atoxicology 3awhite tea1 aJain, Mridula1 aSehgal, Amit1 aSharma, V.L.0 tFood and chemical toxicology.g2012 Dec., v. 50, no. 12 p.4375-4381dElsevier Ltdx0278-69157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fct.2012.08.0453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03162naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001900142245011500161300001600276520155400292592002801846650001201874650001101886650001701897650001501914650002801929650001001957650001501967650000901982650001901991650001102010650002102021650001902042650001502061650001602076650001802092650002002110650001502130650001902145650002502164650001202189650001902201650001302220650000902233651001002242653002002252653001702272653003402289653001702323700002202340700001702362773012002379856007602499852000902575655001202584IND60517298120221121032057.0160329s2012    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051729812DNAL7 a10.4141/cjss2011-0172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aArocena, J.

After 5 yr, one time amendment increased total carbon (g kg⁻¹) from 1.4 (control) to 5.6 (marble waste +sewage sludge) to 8.3 (marble waste+pig manure). Soil pH in amended plots was 6.0 compared with 2.8 in controls. Micromorphological characteristics clearly showed that primary and secondary calcite serve as active sorption sites for organic matter. These calcitic zones were areas conducive to root growth. Soil microstructure in amended mine wastes was dominantly granular, resulting from activities of soil organisms such as fungi and enchytraeds. Results suggest organic matter can be effectively enriched in mine waste deposits through simultaneous additions of pig manure, sewage sludge and calcite. Soil amendments promoting formation of granular structure can accelerate establishment of productive landscapes in degraded mine sites.  aPublisher supplied data 3acalcite 3acarbon 3acase studies 3aecosystems 3aelectrical conductivity 3afungi 3alandscapes 3alead 3amicrostructure 3amining 3anitrogen content 3aorganic matter 3apig manure 3aroot growth 3asewage sludge 3asoil amendments 3asoil biota 3asoil formation 3asoil micromorphology 3asoil pH 3asoil structure 3asorption 3azinc 3aSpain 0aMicromorphology 0acalcite caps 0amonomorphic organic materials 0apedofeatures1 avan Mourik, J.

Chlorination is the most common method of disinfection for water and wastewater worldwide. The purpose of this study was to investigate the underlying causes for discrepancies in human norovirus (hNoV) resistance to free chlorine that have been previously published, and to assess hNoV GI and GII persistence during disinfection of municipal secondary wastewater (WW) effluent. Our results reveal that choice of hNoV purification methodology prior to seeding the viruses in an experimental water matrix influences disinfection outcomes in treatment studies. Common hNoV purification processes such as solvent extraction and 0.45-μm filtration were ineffective in removing high levels of organics introduced into water or wastewater samples when seeding norovirus positive stool. These methods resulted in experimental water matrices receiving an additional 190 mg/L as Cl₂ of 15-s chlorine demand and approximately 440 mg/L as Cl₂ of 30-min chlorine demand due to seeding norovirus positive stool at 1% w/v. These high organic loads impact experimental water chemistry and bias estimations of hNoV persistence. Advanced purification of norovirus positive stool using sucrose cushion ultracentrifugation and ultrafiltration reduced 15-s chlorine demands by 99% and TOC by 93% for loose (i.e. unformed diarrhea) stools. Using these methods, hNoV GI and GII persistence was investigated during free chlorination of municipal WW. A suite five of kinetic inactivation models was fit to viral reverse transcription-qPCR reduction data, and model predicted CT values for 1, 2, and 3 log₁₀ reduction of hNoV GI in municipal WW by free chlorine were 0.3, 2.1, and 7.8 mg-min/L, respectively. Model predicted CT values for reduction of hNoV GII in WW were 0.4, 2.0, and 7.0 mg-min/L, respectively. These results indicate that current WW treatment plant disinfection practices employing free chlorine are likely protective for public health with regards to noroviruses, and will achieve at least 3-log reduction of hNoV GI and GII RNA despite previous reports of high hNoV resistance.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNorovirus 3aRNA 3achlorination 3achlorine 3adiarrhea 3adisinfection 3aexposure pathways 3ahumans 3ahydrochemistry 3amodels 3apublic health 3apurification methods 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3asolvents 3asowing 3asucrose 3aultracentrifugation 3aultrafiltration 3aviruses 3awastewater 0aNorovirus 0aWastewater 0aChlorination 0aStool purification 0aWater treatment1 aWeng, ShihChi1 aCoulter, Caroline G.1 aJacangelo, Joseph G.1 aSchwab, Kellogg J.0 tWater research.g2018 May 01, v. 134 p.1-12dElsevier LtdwJournal:1966x0043-13547nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2018.01.0533Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02323naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001700152245006900169520101000238592002801248650002501276650001001301650001701311650001201328650001001340650001501350650001301365650001501378650001501393650001801408650001201426650001101438651001001449653000901459653002101468653001201489653001101501653001501512700001601527700001701543700001701560700001401577700005401591773010001645856008701745852000901832655001201841IND60678502720221120043903.0191231e20200425xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067850272DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2019.1259352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBertuzzi, T.10aTargeted healthy compounds in small and large-scale brewed beers  aThe determination of targeted healthy compounds in the most popular small and large-scale brewed beer sold in Italy was carried out. Nitrogen compounds, fermentable sugars, total phenolic content and antioxidant capacity, β-glucans, pyridoxine, folates and silicon were quantified. Further, amine content was determined since raw materials and brewing technology can affect their level. Significantly higher values for total phenolic content, antioxidant activity, nitrogen, folate and putrescine content were found for small scale beers. However, the statistical results were affected by the different beer styles in the small scale and large scale brewed beer groups, since the content of these components can vary between beer styles. Positive Pearson correlation was found between total phenolic content and EBC colour. Wide variations in pyridoxine, β-glucans and fermentable sugars levels were observed both for small and large scale beers, while average silicon content of two groups was similar.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantioxidant activity 3abeers 3abeta-glucans 3abrewing 3acolor 3afolic acid 3anitrogen 3aputrescine 3apyridoxine 3araw materials 3asilicon 3asugars 3aItaly 0aBeer 0aPhenolic content 0aFolates 0aAmines 0aCraft beer1 aMulazzi, A.1 aRastelli, S.1 aDonadini, G.1 aRossi, F.1 aSpigno, G.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1636-68510 tFood chemistry.g2020 Apr. 25, v. 310 p.125935-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8139x0308-81467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2019.1259353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02960naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002300146245008900169300001800258500000900276520163900285592002801924650002301952650002201975650002401997650001802021650001402039650001302053650002302066650002202089650001602111650001502127650002802142650002002170650001102190651001302201651001302214700002302227700002802250700002302278773012302301856008102424852000902505655001202514IND60665550620221121203848.0191228e200407  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066555062DNAL7 a10.2135/cropsci2004.13852doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSanderson, Matt A.10aNutritive Value of Virginia Wildrye, a Cool-Season Grass Native to the Northeast USA  ap. 1385-1390.  aepub  aInterest in native plant species for conservation and production has increased because of new federal policies. We evaluated accessions of the native cool-season grass Virginia wildrye (Elymus virginicus L.) from the northeastern USA for nutritive value and its association with plant morphological traits. Thirteen accessions, one cultivar (Omaha), and one commercial ecotype of Elymus were transplanted into single-row field plots in late summer of 2000 at Beltsville, MD, Rock Springs, PA, and Big Flats, NY. Two orchardgrass (Dactylis glomerata L.) cultivars were included. Primary growth was harvested in April (Beltsville) or May (Rock Springs and Big Flats) of 2001 and 2002 and analyzed for neutral detergent fiber (NDF), crude protein (CP), and digestible NDF (dNDF). Nutritive value measures were related to plant morphological attributes [leaf width, length, area, and leaf-to-stem mass ratio (LSR)]. Virginia wildrye accessions differed (P < 0.01) in nutritive value and often had lower NDF and higher CP and dNDF than the commercial ecotype, Omaha cultivar, and orchardgrass. The LSR accounted for most of the variation in nutritive value. Orchardgrass was more mature at harvest than Elymus entries and thus lower in nutritive value. Neutral detergent fiber was negatively correlated with LSR (r = −0.26 to −0.74, P < 0.05), whereas CP and dNDF were positively correlated (r = 0.36 to 0.80 for CP and 0.44 to 0.74 for dNDF, P < 0.05). Neutral detergent fiber was also positively correlated (r = 0.27 to 0.86, P < 0.05) with leaf length. Virginia wildrye is comparable to other cool-season grasses in nutritive value.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDactylis glomerata 3aElymus virginicus 3acool season grasses 3acrude protein 3acultivars 3aecotypes 3aindigenous species 3aissues and policy 3aleaf length 3aleaf width 3aneutral detergent fiber 3anutritive value 3asummer 3aMaryland 3aVirginia1 aSkinner, R.

However, GDI engines emit higher levels of black carbon (BC) aerosols compared to traditional port fuel injection (PFI) engines. Here, we performed coupled chemical transport and radiative transfer simulations to estimate the aerosol-induced public health and direct radiative effects of shifting the U.S. fleet from PFI to GDI technology. By comparing simulations with current emission profiles and emission profiles modified to reflect a shift from PFI to GDI, we calculated the change in aerosol (mostly BC) concentrations associated with the fleet change. Standard concentration-response calculations indicated that the total annual deaths in the U.S. attributed to particulate gasoline-vehicle emissions would increase from 855 to 1599 due to shifting from PFI to GDI. Furthermore, the increase in BC associated with the shift would lead to an annual average positive radiative effect over the U.S. of approximately +0.075 W/m², with values as large as +0.45 W/m² over urban regions. On the other hand, the reduction in CO₂ emissions associated with the enhanced fuel economy of GDI vehicles would yield a globally uniform negative radiative effect, estimated to be −0.013 W/m² over a 20 year time horizon. Therefore, the climate burden of the increase in BC emissions dominates over the U.S., especially over source regions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaerosols 3acarbon 3acarbon dioxide 3aclimate 3aenvironmental science 3agasoline 3amarket share 3apublic health 3aradiative transfer 3atechnology1 aWalters, Stacy1 aPfister, Gabriele1 aKooperman, Gabriel J.1 aSaleh, Rawad1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4951-79620 tEnvironmental science & technology.g2019 Dec. 26, v. 54, no. 2 p.687-696dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23339x1520-58517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.9b041153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03450naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001900146245009100165300001800256500000900274520204100283592002802324650001802352650002502370650001302395650001902408650001602427650002402443650001202467650001402479650001202493650002402505650002002529650002002549650000902569650001602578650001902594650001102613650002302624650001902647650002502666650001602691650001702707700001802724773012402742856008102866852000902947655001202956IND60665550720221121203855.0191228e200409  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066555072DNAL7 a10.2135/cropsci2004.17292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Zhaolong10aPhysiological Recovery of Kentucky Bluegrass from Simultaneous Drought and Heat Stress  ap. 1729-1736.  aepub  aDrought and heat are two major factors limiting growth of cool season grasses. Rapid recovery from the combination of those stresses is important for the persistence of perennial turfgrasses. The study was designed to examine physiological factors associated with the persistence and recovery of Kentucky bluegrass (Poa pratensis L.) exposed to combined drought and heat stress following rewatering and/or temperature drop. Two cultivars differing in drought and heat tolerance, ‘Midnight’ (tolerant) and ‘Brilliant’ (sensitive), were exposed to drought and heat stress (35°C) simultaneously in a growth chamber until most plants became brown and completely desiccated (14 d). Plants were then subjected to three recovery treatments: (i) rewatered but exposed to heat stress (rewatering); (ii) returned to optimum temperature (20°C) but unwatered (cooling), and (iii) rewatering and cooling. Leaf photochemical efficiency (Fv/Fm), chlorophyll content, and activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) declined, while electrolyte leakage (EL) and lipid peroxidation increased rapidly during the combined stress. The adverse impact of the combined stress was more severe for Brilliant than for Midnight. Following rewatering or in combination with cooling, all parameters except chlorophyll content fully recovered for Midnight. However, for Brilliant, most of the parameters did not recover completely; Fv/Fm recovered partially. There was no recovery for any parameters of either cultivar when plants were returned to the optimum temperature but still unwatered. The results suggested that simultaneous drought and heat stress could cause permanent physiological damage for Kentucky bluegrass, particularly for the stress-sensitive cultivar. Rewatering was essential for physiological recovery from the combined stress, regardless of temperature conditions. Rapid resumption of Fv/Fm, cell membrane stability, and antioxidant activities were important factors contributing to the recovery of Kentucky bluegrass.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPoa pratensis 3aantioxidant activity 3acatalase 3acell membranes 3achlorophyll 3acool season grasses 3acooling 3acultivars 3adrought 3aelectrolyte leakage 3aenzyme activity 3agrowth chambers 3aheat 3aheat stress 3aheat tolerance 3aleaves 3alipid peroxidation 3aphotochemistry 3asuperoxide dismutase 3atemperature 3aturf grasses1 aHuang, Bingru0 tCrop science.g2004 Sept., v. 44, no. 5 p.1729-1736dCrop Science Society of AmericawJournal:jnl44570x0011-183X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2135/cropsci2004.17293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02428naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001900143245010200162300001600264520127700280592002801557650001501585650001301600650002001613650001901633650001101652650000901663650001601672650002101688650001801709650001601727650001201743700002401755700002201779700002201801773013201823856007801955852000902033655001202042IND60765332620221118234226.0220714e20181130xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076533262DNAL7 a10.17221/591/2018-pse2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBalík, Jiří10aSoil carbon transformation in long-term field experiments with different fertilization treatments  ap. 578-586.  aSoil carbon transformation was observed in long-term stationary field experiments (longer than 20 years) at two sites with different soil-climatic conditions (Luvisol, Chernozem). The following crops were rotated within the trial: row crops (potatoes or maize)-winter wheat-spring barley. All three crops were grown each year. Four different fertilization treatments were used: (a) no fertilizer (control); (b) sewage sludge (9.383 t dry matter/ha/3 years); (c) farmyard manure (15.818 t dry matter/ha/3 years); (d) mineral NPK fertilization (330 kg N, 90 kg P, 300 kg K/ha/3 years). At the Luvisol site, the control treatment showed a tendency to decrease organic carbon (C<sub>org</sub>) in topsoil. At organic fertilization treatments the content of C<sub>org</sub> increased: sewage sludge – +15.0% (Luvisol) and +21.8% (Chernozem), farmyard manure – +19.0% (Luvisol) and +15.9% (Chernozem). At the NPK fertilization, the increase was +4.8% (Luvisol) and +4.7% (Chernozem). The increased C<sub>org</sub> content was also associated with an increase of microbial biomass carbon (C<sub>mic</sub>) and extractable organic carbon (0.01 mol/L CaCl<sub>2</sub> and hot water extraction). The ratio of C<sub>mic</sub> in C<sub>org</sub> was within the range 0.93–1.37%.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChernozems 3aLuvisols 3aNPK fertilizers 3aanimal manures 3abarley 3acorn 3aenvironment 3amicrobial carbon 3asewage sludge 3asoil carbon 3atopsoil1 aČerný, Jindřich,1 aKulhánek, Martin1 aSedlář, Ondřej0 tPlant, Soil and Environment.g, v. 64, no. 12 p.578-586dCzech Academy of Agricultural ScienceswJournal:17122x1214-11787nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.17221/591/2018-pse3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02746naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002300094040001800117100002100135245008900156300001500245520131300260592002801573650001801601650002101619650001501640650001901655650002201674650002001696650001001716650001001726650001101736650001701747650001201764650002101776650001401797650002501811650003601836700001801872700001801890700002301908773015201931856006902083856010402152990002302256852000902279655001202288IND60643179520221119131956.0190510e20181102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064317952DNAL7 a10.3791/560912doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPolley, Smarajit12aA guide to production, crystallization, and structure determination of human ikk1/α  ap. e56091.  aA class of extracellular stimuli requires activation of IKK1/α to induce generation of an NF-κB subunit, p52, through processing of its precursor p100. p52 functions as a homodimer or heterodimer with another NF-κB subunit, RelB. These dimers in turn regulate the expression of hundreds of genes involved in inflammation, cell survival, and cell cycle. IKK1/α primarily remains associated with IKK2/β and NEMO as a ternary complex. However, a small pool of it is also observed as a low molecular weight complex(es). It is unknown if the p100 processing activity is triggered by activation of IKK1/α within the larger or the smaller complex pool. Constitutive activity of IKK1/α has been detected in several cancers and inflammatory diseases. To understand the mechanism of activation of IKK1/α, and enable its use as a drug target, we expressed recombinant IKK1/α in different host systems, such as E. coli, insect, and mammalian cells. We succeeded in expressing soluble IKK1/α in baculovirus infected insect cells, obtaining mg quantities of highly pure protein, crystallizing it in the presence of inhibitors, and determining its X-ray crystal structure. Here, we describe the detailed steps to produce the recombinant protein, its crystallization, and its X-ray crystal structure determination.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBaculoviridae 3aEscherichia coli 3acell cycle 3acell viability 3acrystal structure 3acrystallization 3adrugs 3agenes 3ahumans 3ainflammation 3ainsects 3amolecular weight 3aneoplasms 3arecombinant proteins 3atranscription factor NF-kappa B1 aHuang, De-Bin1 aBiswas, Tapan1 aGhosh, Gourisankar0 tJournal of visualized experiments.g2018 Nov. 02, , no. 141 p.e56091-e56091dJournal of Visualized ExperimentswJournal:jnl4469330x1940-087X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3791/560913Available from publisher's site  uhttp://www.jove.com/video/56091/a-guide-to-production-crystallization-structure-determination-human  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02617naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001500140245011900155300001800274520125700292592002801549650001501577650001101592650001201603650001401615650001301629650001301642650002801655650002201683650001101705650001301716650001901729650002501748650001101773650001501784650001801799650002001817650001601837700001401853700002001867700001801887700001801905773014101923856007402064852000902138655001202147IND60671057220221116142932.0191002e20150407xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067105722DNAL7 a10.1039/c5ta00458f2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYuan, Yong10aConversion of sewage sludge into high-performance bifunctional electrode materials for microbial energy harvesting  ap. 8475-8482.  aConversion of sewage sludge (SS) into value-added biochar has garnered increasing attention due to its potential applications as a soil amendment and pollutant adsorbent. In this study, we propose a new application of the SS-derived biochar as an advanced bifunctional electrode material (anode and cathode) in microbial fuel cells (MFCs). To function as an anode, the SS amended with various amounts of coconut shell was pressed into a mold and then converted into SS-derived carbon monoliths (SMs) by heat treatment. Meanwhile, powdered SMs (PSMs) were used as the catalysts for oxygen reduction in the cathodes of the MFCs. The maximum power density of 969 ± 28 mW m⁻² was achieved from the MFC with a SM anode and a PSM cathode, which was ca. 2.4 times that of the MFC with a graphite anode and a Pt cathode. The enhanced electrical conductivity of the SMs caused by amending the coconut shell resulted in the enrichment of exoelectrogens and the decrease in electron transfer resistance, which were responsible for the excellent performances of the as-prepared electrodes. This study suggests a promising method to convert SS into bifunctional electrode materials, offering a new opportunity for value-added applications of SS-derived biochar.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorbents 3aanodes 3abiochar 3acatalysts 3acathodes 3acoconuts 3aelectrical conductivity 3aelectron transfer 3aenergy 3agraphene 3aheat treatment 3amicrobial fuel cells 3aoxygen 3apollutants 3asewage sludge 3asoil amendments 3avalue added1 aLiu, Ting1 aFu, P.q(Peng),1 aTang, Jiahuan1 aZhou, Shungui0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2015 Apr. 7, v. 3, no. 16 p.8475-8482dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c5ta00458f3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03869naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100005700139245011600196500002000312520228000332592002802612596008602640596007002726650001902796650001102815650001302826650001202839650001402851650001402865650001702879650001002896650001102906650001102917650001402928650001102942650001602953650001602969650001402985650002502999650002303024650001203047650001403059650002303073700002203096700005603118773010703174856007303281852000903354655001203363IND60712247320221116202928.0201009e202009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071224732DNAL7 a10.1002/ecs2.32512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aToji, Tsubasa1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4899-339010aSeasonal change of flower sex ratio and pollinator dynamics in three reproductive ecotypes of protandrous plant  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aCimicifuga simplex has three genetically and ecologically distinct pollination morphs with different flowering phenology, flower sex expressions, and selfing rates. A previous study showed that strong protandry in hermaphroditic flowers of C. simplex causes there to be seasonal minority sexes; for example, unisexual female ramets are advantageous in the first half of the flowering season and bloom then (minority sex hypothesis). That study, however, did not distinguish among the three pollination morphs of C. simplex. We investigated seasonal sex ratio changes and pollinator environments of the three morphs to verify and expand the minority sex hypothesis. We investigated flowering phenology, pollinator quantity and quality, seasonal population sex ratio dynamics, and stamen/ovule ratios in hermaphroditic flowers. We also examined the seasonal female reproductive success of hermaphroditic flowers, and the effect of male flower excision on fruit set by morph II hermaphroditic flowers. Morph I (mainly hermaphroditic and female ramets) had high pollinator quality and quantity. Fruit set of hermaphroditic ramets was high throughout the flowering season. Morph II (hermaphroditic and andromonoecious ramets) had low pollinator quality, and few pollinators visited near the beginning and end of the season. Removal of male flowers led to a pollen limitation. Morph III (hermaphroditic ramets and a high selfing rate) had very low pollinator abundance throughout the flowering season, and male and female phases largely overlapped. The scarcity of male flowers in morph I is likely a result of the high pollinator quantity and quality. The high fruit set suggests that no pollen limitation existed. The low pollinator quality and quantity of the morph II population caused it to suffer from pollen limitation and may explain the absence of unisexual female ramets in this morph. The high selfing rate of morph III may be due to the extremely low pollinator abundance. Theoretical studies have indicated that the optimal investment allocation to male and female functions depends on whether a pollen limitation exists. In C. simplex, the observed relationships between pollinator environment and reproductive systems are consistent with these theoretical models.  aPublisher supplied data  a15H02641cJapanese Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology  cSasakawa Scientific Research Grant from the Japan Science Society 3aActaea simplex 3aclones 3aecotypes 3afemales 3aflowering 3afruit set 3amale flowers 3amales 3amorphs 3aovules 3aphenology 3apollen 3apollination 3apollinators 3aprotandry 3areproductive success 3aseasonal variation 3aselfing 3asex ratio 3atheoretical models1 aIshimoto, Natsumi1 aItino, Takao1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6797-76230 tEcosphere.g2020 Sept., v. 11, no. 9 p.e03251-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:12363x2150-89257nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ecs2.32513Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02870naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100002200166245007900188300001600267520136200283592002801645650002901673650001901702650002401721650001601745650001101761650001501772650002801787650001601815650001401831650002201845650001201867650001301879650001001892650001601902650001401918651001401932651002301946651001401969700002201983700002802005700003302033700002602066700002202092700002202114773009102136856008102227990002302308852000902331655001202340IND60093920020221123033256.0141104e20120424xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009392002DNAL7 a225035002pmid7 a10.1016/j.cub.2012.02.0682doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHughes, Terry P.10aAssembly Rules of Reef Corals Are Flexible along a Steep Climatic Gradient  ap. 736-741.  aCoral reefs, one of the world's most complex and vulnerable ecosystems, face an uncertain future in coming decades as they continue to respond to anthropogenic climate change, overfishing, pollution, and other human impacts [1, 2]. Traditionally, marine macroecology is based on presence/absence data from taxonomic checklists or geographic ranges, providing a qualitative overview of spatial shifts in species richness that treats rare and common species equally [3, 4]. As a consequence, regional and long-term shifts in relative abundances of individual taxa are poorly understood. Here we apply a more rigorous quantitative approach to examine large-scale spatial variation in the species composition and abundance of corals on midshelf reefs along the length of Australia's Great Barrier Reef, a biogeographic region where species richness is high and relatively homogeneous [5]. We demonstrate that important functional components of coral assemblages “sample” space differently at 132 sites separated by up to 1740 km, leading to complex latitudinal shifts in patterns of absolute and relative abundance. The flexibility in community composition that we document along latitudinal environmental gradients indicates that climate change is likely to result in a reassortment of coral reef taxa rather than wholesale loss of entire reef ecosystems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanthropogenic activities 3aclimate change 3acommunity structure 3acoral reefs 3acorals 3aecosystems 3ainterspecific variation 3aoverfishing 3apollution 3aspecies diversity 2aAnimals 2aAnthozoa 2aBiota 2aCoral Reefs 2aEcosystem 3aAustralia 3aGreat Barrier Reef 0aAustralia1 aBaird, Andrew H.1 aDinsdale, Elizabeth A.1 aMoltschaniwskyj, Natalie A.1 aPratchett, Morgan S.1 aTanner, Jason E.1 aWillis, Bette L.0 tCurrent biology.g2012 Apr. 24, v. 22, no. 8 p.736-741dElsevier Inc.x0960-98227nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2012.02.0683Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02160naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002900139245011300168300002000281520097700301592002801278650002401306650001301330650001701343650001601360650002001376650002101396650002401417650001301441650002101454650001601475650001101491650000901502700001801511700002501529773013601554856007501690852000901765655001201774IND60537556220221119170817.0160809e20130821xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053755622DNAL7 a10.1021/ie400232r2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPrasertkittikul, Sirawan10aDeproteinization of Natural Rubber Using Protease Immobilized on Epichlorohydrin Cross-linked Chitosan Beads  ap. 11723-11731.  aDeproteinization of natural rubber using an alkaline protease from Bacillus sp. immobilized on cross-linked chitosan beads is reported. Conditions were identified for attaining a high activity of the immobilized enzyme on the beads. The optimally produced enzyme beads were then used to establish the conditions for effective deproteinization of natural rubber. A two-level full factorial design was used to quantify the main effects and the interaction of the factors influencing the formation of the catalytic beads and the rubber deproteinization process. Results showed that by using the optimal deproteinization process, the total nitrogen level in the rubber was reduced from 0.35% to 0.013% w/w, or a >96% nitrogen removal. In contrast, the urea method of deproteinization achieved a lower nitrogen removal of <86%.The immobilized protease could be used for at least five repeated deproteinization cycles without losing more than 10% of the initial enzyme activity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillus (bacteria) 3achitosan 3acrosslinking 3aengineering 3aenzyme activity 3aepichlorohydrins 3aimmobilized enzymes 3anitrogen 3anitrogen content 3aproteinases 3arubber 3aurea1 aChisti, Yusuf1 aHansupalak, Nanthiya0 tIndustrial & Engineering Chemistry Research.g2013 Aug. 21, v. 52, no. 33 p.11723-11731dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-50457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fie400232r3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03325naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245019100169300001600360520173400376592002802110650001102138650001602149650001402165650001402179650001602193650001102209650001802220650002702238650001102265650001102276650000902287650001202296650001402308650001302322650001202335653003202347653003002379653002602409653002102435653001102456653002702467700001802494700005202512700001702564700002002581773011102601856008602712852000902798655001202807IND60593740520221120082607.0190516e201804  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059374052DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodres.2017.12.0822doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Xiaoai10aEffects of the gastric juice injection pattern and contraction frequency on the digestibility of casein powder suspensions in an in vitro dynamic rat stomach made with a 3D printed model  ap. 495-502.  aPreviously, we have prepared a version of the dynamic in vitro rat stomach system (DIVRS-II or Biomimic Rat II). It was constructed and tested by showing similar digestive behaviors with those occurred in vivo. In the present work, a 3D-printed plastic mold was employed to create highly repeatable silicone rat stomach model. It has been seen to have shortened the time to handcraft a model like that used in DIVRS-II. The maximum mechanical force of the current stomach model generated by rolling extrusion is found to be more stable probably due to the more uniform wall thickness of the new model. Then the effects of the simulated gastric secretion patterns and contraction frequency of the system on the in vitro digestibility of casein powder suspensions were investigated. The results have shown that the location of the gastric secretion injection has an impact on experimental digestibility. The position of rolling-extrusion area, established at the central part of glandular portion (stomach B), displayed the highest digestibility compared to that at the other locations. Furthermore, the extent of digestion was positively correlated with the contraction frequency of the model stomach system, with the maximum frequency of 12cpm giving the highest digestibility. This highest digestibility is almost the same as the average value found in vivo. The better digestive performance produced by optimizing the gastric secretion pattern and contraction frequency may be both resulted from the improved mixing efficiency of the food matrix with digestive juice. This study shows that it is possible to achieve what in vivo in a simulated digestion device, which may be used for future food and nutrition studies in vitro.  aPublisher supplied data 3acasein 3acorrelation 3adigestion 3aextrusion 3afood matrix 3aforces 3agastric juice 3ain vitro digestibility 3amixing 3amodels 3arats 3arolling 3asecretion 3asilicone 3astomach 0a3D-printed rat stomach mold 0aGastric secretion pattern 0aContraction frequency 0aMechanical force 0aCasein 0aIn vitro digestibility1 aLiao, Zhenkai1 aWu, Peng1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0736-97941 aChen, Liding1 aChen, Xiao Dong0 tFood research international.g2018 Apr., v. 106 p.495-502dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl48420x0963-99697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodres.2017.12.0823Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03952naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002000139245007700159500002000236520235400256592002802610596005002638596002902688650001402717650002102731650001902752650001102771650001902782650002002801650001502821650001102836650001902847650001502866650001302881650001002894650001202904650001302916650001102929650001602940650001802956650002502974650001102999650002003010650001603030651001403046700001803060700002003078700002103098700002203119700002103141700002303162773010703185856007303292852000903365655001203374IND60712247420221116203230.0201009e202009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071224742DNAL7 a10.1002/ecs2.32442doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZimmer, Kyle D.10aStable isotope patterns in lake food webs reflect productivity gradients  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aStable isotopes ¹³C and ¹⁵N are often used in lake ecosystems to assess energy sources and trophic positions, respectively. However, δ¹³C and δ¹⁵N are also influenced by internal biogeochemical processes in epilimnetic and hypolimnetic habitats in lakes, but the extent to which biogeochemical processing mediates isotope values between these two habitats, and whether these patterns are influenced by lake productivity is not known. We sampled δ¹³C and δ¹⁵N in epilimnetic mussels, Chaoborus, cisco (Coregonus artedi), and seston and zooplankton in the epilimnia and hypolimnia of 22 Minnesota (USA) lakes ranging from oligotrophic to eutrophic. We also measured lake temperature–oxygen profiles and light levels to assess factors influencing isotope patterns. Isotope samples were baseline‐corrected using epilimnetic mussels in each lake (sample—mussel) to control for watershed‐level differences in isotope values. Results showed δ¹³C in epilimnetic and hypolimnetic zooplankton, hypolimnetic seston, Chaoborus, and cisco became more depleted in δ¹³C relative to epilimnetic mussels in low‐productivity lakes where light penetrated into the hypolimnion, while epilimnetic seston δ¹³C stayed similar to mussel δ¹³C in all lakes. This pattern was likely due to hypolimnetic phytoplankton in clearwater lakes incorporating more respired CO₂, which is depleted in δ¹³C, and subsequently passing depleted δ¹³C values up the food chain. Results also showed habitat differences in δ¹⁵N with epilimnetic and hypolimnetic zooplankton, hypolimnetic seston, Chaoborus, and cisco becoming more enriched relative to epilimnetic mussels in low‐productivity lakes with higher O₂ levels in the hypolimnion, while epilimnetic seston δ¹⁵N remained similar to mussel values. The δ¹⁵N pattern is consistent with the idea that denitrification and microbial degradation enriched hypolimnetic seston relative to epilimnetic seston in low nutrient lakes, while enhanced epilimnetic primary production enriched epilimnetic δ¹⁵N seston relative to hypolimnetic seston in high nutrient lakes. Our results indicate isotopic differences between epilimnetic and hypolimnetic organisms that change along productivity gradients and suggest that microbial processes and the light regime are important drivers.  aPublisher supplied data  cFederal Aid in Sport Fish Restoration Program  cUniversity of St. Thomas 3aChaoborus 3aCoregonus artedi 3abiodegradation 3acarbon 3acarbon dioxide 3adenitrification 3aecosystems 3aenergy 3aeutrophication 3afood chain 3ahabitats 3alakes 3amussels 3anitrogen 3aoxygen 3aphotoperiod 3aphytoplankton 3aprimary productivity 3aseston 3astable isotopes 3azooplankton 3aMinnesota1 aGrow, Ryan C.1 aTipp, Angela R.1 aHerwig, Brian R.1 aStaples, David F.1 aCotner, James B.1 aJacobson, Peter C.0 tEcosphere.g2020 Sept., v. 11, no. 9 p.e03244-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:12363x2150-89257nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ecs2.32443Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03021naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100003400147245005200181300001200233520159900245592002801844650001301872650002301885650001701908650002201925650001001947650001701957650001401974650002401988650001102012650001102023650001902034650000702053650001902060650001402079650001202093650001402105650001402119650001302133650002502146651001002171653002102181653003202202653002002234700001902254700002102273773011902294856008102413852000902494655001202503IND60604616420221120053219.0180717e20150802xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060461642DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jep.2015.05.0262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChristensen, Charlotte Bremer10aAntacid activity of Laportea aestuans (L.) Chew  ap. 1-3.  aLaportea aestuans (L.) Chew (Urticaceae) was historically ingested together with chalk by pregnant women in Ghana when suffering from heartburn. The aim of this study was to evaluate the antacid activity of the aerial parts of L. aestuans.Aerial parts of L. aestuans were collected in the Accra region of Ghana. The antacid activity was measured according to Fordtran׳s titration model. 90mL tap water and test material in a 500mL beaker were warmed to 37°C on a magnetic stirrer and was continuously stirred at approximately 30rpm in order to mimic the movements of the stomach. A titration was carried out with an artificial gastric acid to the end point of pH 3. The acid secretion rate was approximately 3mL and pH was monitored with a pH meter. Concentrations of 666 and 1332mg dried plant material were tested, both with and without addition of calcium carbonate (CaCO3).Both CaCO3 and L. aestuans had a significant better ability than water to neutralise an artificial stomach acid. 666mg plant material together with CaCO3 compared to CaCO3 alone showed approximately the same neutralisation time. When mixing 1332mg plant material with CaCO3 the neutralisation time was significantly higher than for CaCO3 alone and exhibited an antacid profile that was able to maintain the neutralising activity one pH-unit higher for an extended period of time.The results indicate that L. aestuans showed an antacid activity when combined with CaCO3. With further investigations of the active compound, mechanism of action and possible toxicity, the plant could form the basis of a novel antacid.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLaportea 3aactive ingredients 3aaerial parts 3acalcium carbonate 3achalk 3agastric acid 3amagnetism 3amechanism of action 3amixing 3amodels 3aneutralization 3apH 3apregnant women 3asecretion 3astomach 3atap water 3atitration 3atoxicity 3atraditional medicine 3aGhana 0aAntacid activity 0aLaportea aestuans (L.)

On days 3 or 4 of incubation, higher vascular density of YSMs (p <0.05 both of the days), relative expression of HIF-2 α mRNA (p <0.01 and p <0.001 days 3 and 4, respectively), VEGF-A mRNA (p <0.01 and p <0.001 days 3 and 4, respectively) and FLK-1 mRNA (p <0.001 and p <0.0001 day 3 and 4, respectively) were encountered in embryos incubated at 1378 masl as compared to those incubated at 355 masl.

However, detailed description of neural dynamics in symmetric brain regions in adult mammalian animals remains elusive. In this study, we describe an experimental procedure for measuring calcium dynamics through dual optical windows above bilateral primary somatosensory corticies (S1) in Thy1-GCaMP6s transgenic mice using 2-photon (2P) microscopy. This method enables recordings and quantifications of neural activity in bilateral mouse brain regions one at a time in the same experiment for a prolonged period in vivo. Key aspects of this method, which can be completed within an hour, include minimally invasive surgery procedures for creating dual optical windows, and the use of 2P imaging. Although we only demonstrate the technique in the S1 area, the method can be applied to other regions of the living brain facilitating the elucidation of structural and functional complexities of brain neural networks.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadults 3acalcium 3acerebral cortex 3aimage analysis 3amice 3amicroscopy 3asurgery 3atransgenic animals1 aZhao, Tingbao1 aXiong Wenhui,1 aWen, Shaonan1 aJin, Xiaoming1 aXu, Xiao-Ming0 tJournal of visualized experiments.g2019 Jan. 07, , no. 143 p.e56297-e56297dJournal of Visualized ExperimentswJournal:jnl4469330x1940-087X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3791/562973Available from publisher's site  uhttp://www.jove.com/video/56297/imaging-neural-activity-primary-somatosensory-cortex-using-thy1  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02998naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100005800151245010500209520170500314592002802019650001802047650001402065650001102079650002902090650001202119650002602131650001102157650001902168651001002187653005102197653002702248653001702275653001902292653002002311700001302331700002002344700001602364773011302380856008602493852000902579655001202588IND60705636620221118014035.0220719e20201210xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070563662DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.1233242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Xingquan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0437-107414aThe change pattern and driving factors of embodied SO2 emissions in China’s inter-provincial trade  aThis study analyzes the change pattern and driving factors of SO₂ emissions embodied in inter-provincial trade in China during 2007–2012 based on environmentally extended input-output analysis (EEIOA) and structural decomposition analysis (SDA). The results show that: (1) SO₂ emissions outsourced from highly developed coastal provinces to less developed inland provinces decreased sharply since 2007 while those from under-developed provinces like Henan and Hebei to the energy intensive provinces including Shanxi and Inner Mongolia have seen a significant increase. (2) The increased SO₂ emissions induced by final demand of construction and heavy sectors in less developed provinces in central and western China have transferred to mining and energy production sectors in the northwest and northern China majorly through intermediate products trade. (3) The rising final demands for local finished and imported final products caused by investment demand are the main driver for the increase of SO₂ emissions embodied in domestic imports in underdeveloped provinces in central and western China. Compared to the less developed inland provinces, the production and consumption modes of the developed coastal provinces are in transition to more favorable ways of reducing emissions embodied in domestic imports. Therefore, environment protection should center on reducing SO₂ emissions transfer among less developed provinces caused by investment demands, more specifically, less developed provinces need to rationally plan the development of construction and heavy sectors. Meanwhile, provinces rich in resources and energy need to cut down SO₂ emission through technical innovation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair pollution 3aemissions 3aenergy 3aenvironmental protection 3aimports 3ainput output analysis 3amining 3asulfur dioxide 3aChina 0aEnvironmentally extended input-output analysis 0aInter-provincial trade 0aSO2 emission 0aChange pattern 0aDriving factors1 aLiu, Wei1 aZhang, Jianqing1 aLi, Zhiping0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2020 Dec. 10, v. 276 p.123324-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.1233243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01951naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100001500188245007300203300001600276506007600292520076200368592002801130506003701158650000801195650002001203650001101223650001601234650001001250650001201260650001301272650001901285650002801304650002001332700001701352773009401369856008101463852000901544655001201553IND60082036020221207102715.0141015e201410  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008203602DNAL7 a10.1007/s11515-014-1330-22doi7 aPMC42835992pmcid7 a255686442pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Hongda10aRegulation and function of stimulus-induced phosphorylation of MeCP2  ap. 367-375.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aDNA methylation-dependent epigenetic regulation plays important roles in the development and function of the mammalian nervous system. MeCP2 is a key player in recognizing methylated DNA and interpreting the epigenetic information encoded in different DNA methylation patterns. Mutations in the MECP2 gene cause Rett syndrome, a devastating neurological disease that shares many features with autism. One interesting aspect of MeCP2 function is that it can be phosphorylated in response to diverse stimuli. Insights into the regulation and function of MeCP2 phosphorylation will help improve our understanding of how MeCP2 integrates environmental stimuli in neuronal nuclei to generate adaptive responses and may eventually lead to treatments for patients.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDNA 3aDNA methylation 3aautism 3aepigenetics 3agenes 3amammals 3amutation 3anervous system 3anervous system diseases 3aphosphorylation1 aChang, Qiang0 tFrontiers in biology.g2014 Oct., v. 9, no. 5 p.367-375dSpringer-Verlagx1674-79847nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11515-014-1330-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02323naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002700147245008500174300001600259520124000275592002801515650002901543650001301572650001501585650001101600650001101611650001001622651001101632700002101643700002301664700002401687700002601711700002301737773011101760856008101871852000901952655001201961IND50073666420221119092540.0150213e201404  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007366642DNAL7 a10.1007/s10658-013-0354-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSaucedo-Carabez, J.

Hass and Mendez avocado trees was evaluated in Grove 1 in Uruapan county: four trees were sunblotch-infected, four asymptomatic (molecularly positive), and four healthy. A further four healthy and four symptomatic trees were evaluated in Grove 2 in Tingambato county. There was a significant 75 % reduction in the total Hass fruit weight from symptomatic trees in Grove 1 (213 kg vs 751 kg in healthy trees) and a 52 % reduction (124 kg vs 255 kg) in Grove 2 (Tukey, p = 0.05). This reduction was more severe in Mendez: 83 % in Grove 1 (183 kg vs 1,053 kg) and 76 % in Grove 2 (82 kg vs 340 kg). Yield of asymptomatic trees was reduced to 58 % in Mendez and 30 % in Hass. The average weight of 100 fruits was reduced by 13–28 % in Hass and 20–27 % in Mendez in Groves 2 and 1 respectively. The equatorial diameter of 100 symptomatic fruits was 8 % lower in Hass in both groves, and 20–28 % lower in Mendez. The polar diameter decreased by 8–10 % in Hass and 10–11 % in Mendez. The incidence of symptomatic fruits was 46–62 % in Hass and 20–28 % in Mendez. Yield of ASBVd symptomatic Hass and Mendez trees was significantly reduced and fruit morphology negatively affected.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAvocado sunblotch viroid 3aavocados 3acrop yield 3afruits 3agroves 3atrees 3aMexico1 aTéliz-Ortiz, D.1 aOchoa-Ascencio, S.1 aOchoa-Martínez, D.1 aVallejo-Pérez, M.

Chromosomal karyotyping was done with in situ hybridization using two types of simple sequence repeats (SSR)s, (AAG)₅ and (AAC)₅ labeled with tetramethyl-rhodamine-5-dUTP and fluorescein-12-dUPT as a fluorescence, respectively. The two SSRs as cytogenetic markers revealed that the cytogenetic characteristics of the wheat chromosomes were remarkably a B genome. In this study, the chromosomal karyotype of Keumkang, a Korean hexaploid wheat cultivar, was the A, B, and D genomes used as a cytogenetic reference. The expressed signals from the two SSRs showed a difference in the chromosomal karyotype of chromosome 1B among the Korean hexaploid wheat. The distribution pattern and the degree of condensation for the (AAG)₅ and (AAC)₅ signals on the short arm of chromosome 1B were different in the Korean hexaploid wheat shown in descending order: Keumkang > Joeun > Johan > Olgeuru. Olgeuru had a lower level of distribution and condensation for the two SSRs signals compared to the other Korean hexaploid wheat. In the A genome, chromosome 7A showed an unbalanced expression of the (AAG)₅ signal on the distal region of the short and long arms in several Korean hexaploid wheat while Joeun, a Korean hexaploid wheat, showed a definite (AAG)₅ signal on the distal region of each arm of chromosome 7A. Among the Korean hexaploid wheat, Shinmichal1, a Korean hexaploid waxy wheat, had a chromosome with a unique expression pattern for (AAG)₅ and (AAC)₅ compared the other Korean hexaploid wheat. Those cytogenetic differences identified in this study are useful as an indicator to improve the cytogenetic diversity in the Korean wheat breeding program.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTriticum aestivum 3abreeding programs 3achromosomes 3acultivars 3afluorescence 3agenome 3ahexaploidy 3ain situ hybridization 3akaryotyping 3amicrosatellite repeats 3awheat1 aKang, Seong-Wook1 aKang, Taek-Gyu1 aPak, Chul-su,1 aKim, Changsoo1 aKang, Chon-Sik0 tJournal of crop science and biotechnology.g2018 Dec., v. 21, no. 5 p.491-497dThe Korean Society of Crop SciencewJournal:J000000101x1975-94797nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12892-018-0245-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02198naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094024003500130040001800165100002100183245010500204300001400309520099200323592002801315650001901343650001301362650001501375650001001390650001501400650002301415650000901438650000901447653001501456653001301471653000901484653000901493653001401502700001901516700001901535700001701554773011401571856008201685852000901767655001201776IND60624512120221122053301.0181203e19880101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062451212DNAL7 a10.1258/0023677887807466742doi4 a0023-6772(19880101)22:1L.67;1-  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBlackshaw, J.

Behavioural patterns were recorded to give some indication of the stress involved. Carbon dioxide induced collapse faster (11·2 ± 0·4 s) than chloroform(18·9 ± 0·4 s) or ether (> 60 s). With regard to the time taken to death, in carbon dioxide mice had the shortest time (48 ± 10 s) and mature rats had the longest time (135 ± 10 s). In chloroform, the only difference was the delayed onset of death (127 ± 10 s) in the chicken. Behavioural patterns were similar for the chicken in carbon dioxide and chloroform, except for wing flapping, even when unconscious, in carbon dioxide. Chloroform is recommended as more aesthetically acceptable for euthanasia of chickens. Carbon dioxide is recommended for the euthanasia of both rats and mice, considering behavioural criteria. Ether is unsuitable as a euthanasia method as it is dangerous, slow acting and an irritant.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon dioxide 3achickens 3achloroform 3adeath 3aeuthanasia 3alaboratory animals 3amice 3arats 0aEUTHANASIA 0aCHICKENS 0aRATS 0aMICE 0aBEHAVIOUR1 aFenwick, D.

R264-R265.  aLETTER  aCultivation may be described as a process of co-evolution and niche construction, with two species developing a mutualistic relationship through association, leading to coordinated change [1]. Cultivation is rare but taxonomically widespread, benefiting the cultivator, usually through increased access to food, and the cultivar, by improved growth and protection, driving co-evolutionary changes (Supplemental information). Humans cultivate more than food, producing clothing, construction materials, fuel, drugs, and ornaments. A population of male spotted bowerbirds Ptilonorhynchus (Chlamydera) maculata uses fruits of Solanum ellipticum (Figure 1A), not as food but as important components of their sexual display [2,3]. Here, we show that males indirectly cultivate plants bearing these fruit — the first example of cultivation of a non-food item by a species other than humans. Plants appear at bowers following male occupation (Figure 1B). Males benefit, exhibiting more fruit at their bowers. Plants benefit because fruit are deposited in better germination sites. Fruits from plants near bowers differ visually from those far from bowers, and look more similar to fruits that are preferred by males in choice tests.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSolanum ellipticum 3aclothing 3acoevolution 3aconstruction materials 3acultivars 3adrugs 3afruits 3afuels 3agermination 3ahumans 3amales 2aAnimals 2aFruit 2aGermination 2aMale 2aPasseriformes 2aSexual Behavior, Animal 2aSolanumxgrowth & development 0aQueensland1 aDingle, Caroline1 aIsden, Jess1 aSparfeld, Janka1 aGoldizen, Anne W.1 aEndler, John A.0 tCurrent biology.g2012 Apr. 24, v. 22, no. 8 p.R264-R265dElsevier Inc.x0960-98227nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2012.02.0573Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle04121naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100005600153245011800209300001400327520249900341592002802840650002202868650001202890650002002902650001602922650001402938650001502952650001002967650001002977650001102987650001102998650001403009650003003023650001603053650001803069650002503087650001603112651001603128653003203144653002203176653001603198653002103214653002303235653002703258700001703285700001803302700001803320700002803338773011603366856008803482852000903570655001203579IND60524584520221120125317.0190318e20160101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052458452DNAL7 a10.1016/j.prevetmed.2015.11.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBontje, D.M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3779-446010aAnalysis of Q fever in Dutch dairy goat herds and assessment of control measures by means of a transmission model  ap. 71-89.  aBetween 2006 and 2009 the largest human Q fever epidemic ever described occurred in the Netherlands. The source of infection was traced back to dairy goat herds with abortion problems due to Q fever. The first aim of control measures taken in these herds was the reduction of human exposure. To analyze Q fever dynamics in goat herds and to study the effect of control measures, a within-herd model of Coxiella burnetii transmission in dairy goat herds was developed. With this individual-based stochastic model we evaluated six control strategies and three herd management styles and studied which strategy leads to a lower Q fever prevalence and/or to disease extinction in a goat herd. Parameter values were based on literature and on experimental work. The model could not be validated with independent data.The results of the epidemiological model were:(1) Vaccination is effective in quickly reducing the prevalence in a dairy goat herd. (2) When taking into account the average time to extinction of the infection and the infection pressure in a goat herd, the most effective control strategy is preventive yearly vaccination, followed by the reactive strategies to vaccinate after an abortion storm or after testing BTM (bulk tank milk) positive. (3) As C. burnetii in dried dust may affect public health, an alternative ranking method is based on the cumulative amount of C. burnetii emitted into the environment (from disease introduction until extinction). Using this criterion, the same control strategies are effective as when based on time to extinction and infection pressure (see 2). (4) As the bulk of pathogen excretion occurs during partus and abortion, culling of pregnant animals during an abortion storm leads to a fast reduction of the amount of C. burnetii emitted into the environment. However, emission is not entirely prevented and Q fever will not be eradicated in the herd by this measure. (5) A search & destroy (i.e. test and cull) method by PCR of individual milk samples with a detection probability of 50% of detecting and culling infected goats – that excrete C. burnetii intermittently – will not result in eradication of Q fever in the herd. This control strategy was the least effective of the six evaluated strategies.Subject to model limitations, our results indicate that only vaccination is capable of preventing and controlling Q fever outbreaks in dairy goat farms. Thus, preventive vaccination should be considered as an ongoing control measure.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCoxiella burnetii 3aQ fever 3acontrol methods 3adairy goats 3aexcretion 3aextinction 3afarms 3aherds 3ahumans 3amodels 3apathogens 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aprobability 3apublic health 3astochastic processes 3avaccination 3aNetherlands 0aStochastic simulation model 0aCoxiella burnetii 0aDairy goats 0aControl measures 0aControl strategies 0aPreventive vaccination1 aBacker, J.A.1 aHogerwerf, L.1 aRoest, H.I.J.1 aRoermund, H.

New systems featuring low-activated ion mobility are important to improve the performance in such systems. Herein we report on a model system dealing with such improved properties. Li₀.₂CdP₂ was synthesized from the elements, lithium as structure stabilizer and CdI₂ as reaction promoters in sealed silica ampoules at 823 K. It crystallizes tetragonal, in space group I4₁22 (α-CdAs₂ structure type), with lattice parameters a = 7.6691(8) Å, c = 4.4467(4) Å and V = 261.53(4) Å³. After 24 h of storage in air lithium ions can be removed in a spontaneous delithiation reaction resulting in Li(OH)·H₂O formation on the surface of the crystals. Formed α′-CdP₂ adopts the α-CdAs₂ structure type. Both compounds consist of isolated cadmium atoms and helical 1∞[P⁻]-chains generating empty channels suitable to accommodate Li ions. The heavy atom structure was determined by X-ray diffraction methods while a full model including lithium was derived from a combined solid state NMR and quantum chemical calculation approach. An low activation barrier range in the order of 0.1 to 0.2 eV was determined by NMR spectroscopy pointing towards an extraordinary high Li mobility in Li₀.₂CdP₂. Of course a Cd-based solid will have certain disadvantages like toxicity and mass for storage applications but substitution of Cd by suitable lighter elements can solve this issue.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3aair 3acadmium 3acrystallization 3acrystals 3aenergy 3aions 3alithium 3amodels 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aquantum mechanics 3asemiconductors 3asilica 3astabilizers 3atoxicity1 aKrüger, I.1 aBachhuber, F.1 aWeihrich, R.1 aBarquera-Lozada, J.

For parasites, this theory predicts that parasite populations will evolve, or maintain, broader host ranges when selected in genetically diverse host populations relative to homogeneous host populations. To test this prediction, we selected the bacterial parasite Serratia marcescens to kill Caenorhabditis elegans in populations that were genetically heterogeneous (50% mix of two experimental genotypes) or homogeneous (100% of either genotype). After 20 rounds of selection, we compared the host range of selected parasites by measuring parasite fitness (i.e. virulence, the selected fitness trait) on the two focal host genotypes and on a novel host genotype. As predicted, heterogeneous host populations selected for parasites with a broader host range: these parasite populations gained or maintained virulence on all host genotypes. This result contrasted with selection in homogeneous populations of one host genotype. Here, host range contracted, with parasite populations gaining virulence on the focal host genotype and losing virulence on the novel host genotype. This pattern was not, however, repeated with selection in homogeneous populations of the second host genotype: these parasite populations did not gain virulence on the focal host genotype, nor did they lose virulence on the novel host genotype. Our results indicate that host heterogeneity can maintain broader host ranges in parasite populations. Individual host genotypes, however, vary in the degree to which they select for specialization in parasite populations.  aPublisher supplied data  aK12GM000680cNational Institute of General Medical Sciences  a1750553cDivision of Environmental Biology 3aCaenorhabditis elegans 3aSerratia marcescens 3aevolution 3agenotype 3ahost range 3aparasites 3aprediction 3avirulence1 aBaffoe‐Bonnie, Helena1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3381-30861 aPenley, McKenna J.1 aLin, Julie1 aOwens, Raythe1 aKhalid, Arooj1 aMorran, Levi T.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6422-03740 tJournal of evolutionary biology.g2020 June, v. 33, no. 6 p.773-782dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3867076x1010-061X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jeb.136083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02110naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245007000164300001600234520085600250592002801106650001501134650001301149650000901162650001201171650001301183650001401196650001201210650002301222650001701245650001601262650001301278650002001291650001301311651001001324700002401334700001701358700002101375700001301396700001801409700001801427700002101445773011701466856004801583852000901631655001201640IND50068685020221121003817.0130821e201011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006868502DNAL7 a10.1007/s10661-009-1225-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNayak, A.

Upon intense leaching acid saline soils and acid saline sodic may further develop typical characteristics of acidic soils and acidic sodic soil, respectively. The soil at Guptapara inundated almost due to tsunami with minimal pyrite oxidation has potential to develop into highly acidic soils upon drainage.

Using in situ infrared (IR) and Raman spectroscopy, we investigated the structure and stability of the α-Mg₃(HCOO)₆ framework at high pressures up to 13 GPa. We found that the framework structure was chemically stable under compression, while an irreversible crystal-to-crystal structural transition was observed above 2 GPa. This new phase is likely isostructural with microporous γ-Mg₃(HCOO)₆. In contrast, the α-Mg₃(HCOO)₆ framework loaded with guest molecules such as dimethylformamide and benzene exhibits higher stability to external pressure. Neither a new crystalline phase nor an amorphous material was observed under pressure up to 13 GPa.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aRaman spectroscopy 3aadsorption 3abenzene 3acoordination polymers 3adimethylformamide 3aformates 3aporosity 3aporous media1 aXu, Jun1 aHu, Yue1 aHuang, Yining1 aSong, Yang0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2015 May 26, v. 3, no. 22 p.11976-11984dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c5ta00476d3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02489naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245010600166300001800272500001900290500001100309520118200320592002801502596008201530596005401612596004301666650000801709650001501717650001401732650002001746650001101766650001301777650001501790650001601805650001301821700001501834773015001849856008301999852000902082655001202091IND60712248020221116203053.0210204e202010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071224802DNAL7 a10.1007/s00018-020-03522-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Zhenhua12aA chromatin perspective on metabolic and genotoxic impacts on hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells  ap. 4031-4047.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aReview  aFate determination in self-renewal and differentiation of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSCs and HPCs) is ultimately controlled by gene expression, which is profoundly influenced by the global and local chromatin state. Cellular metabolism directly influences the chromatin state through the dynamic regulation of the enzymatic activities that modify DNA and histones, but also generates genotoxic metabolites that can damage DNA and thus pose threat to the genome integrity. On the other hand, mechanisms modulating the chromatin state impact metabolism by regulating the expression and activities of key metabolic enzymes. Moreover, through regulating either DNA damage response directly or expression of genes involved in this process, chromatin modulators play active and crucial roles in guarding the genome integrity, breaching of which results in defective HSPC function. Therefore, HSPC function is regulated by the dynamic and two-way interactions between metabolism and chromatin. Here, we review recent advances that provide a chromatin perspective on the major impacts the metabolic and genotoxic factors can have on HSPC function and fate determination.  aPublisher supplied data  aR01DK105531cNational Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases  a128609-RSG-15-166-01-DMCcAmerican Cancer Society  a1354-19cLeukemia and Lymphoma Society 3aDNA 3aDNA damage 3achromatin 3agene expression 3agenome 3ahistones 3ametabolism 3ametabolites 3amutagens1 aJiang, Hao0 tCellular and molecular life sciences.g2020 Oct., v. 77, no. 20 p.4031-4047dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl55291x1420-682X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00018-020-03522-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01583naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100002400166245005600190300001800246520032300264592002800587650000800615650003000623650001700653650001100670650002900681650005300710650003600763650003000799650005100829650004200880650005100922700001800973773009300991856008101084990002301165852000901188655001201197IND60093920820221122001206.0141104e20120424xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009392082DNAL7 a225376292pmid7 a10.1016/j.cub.2012.03.0192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHolmberg, Christian10aReplication: DNA Building Block Synthesis On Demand  ap.

After cell immobilization in modified thin alginate layers, three types of β-lactam antibiotics (cefotaxime, carbenicillin, or timentin) at five different concentrations (100, 200, 300, 400, or 500 mg L⁻¹) were added to the culture medium. In 20-d-old cultures, a different number of cell colonies had formed and varied on average from 27 to 56% in carbenicillin- and cefotaxime-containing media, respectively. Supplementation of the culture media with antibiotics at concentrations higher than 100 mg L⁻¹ resulted in a decrease in plating efficiency in comparison with the controls. However, from all antibiotic treatments, except carbenicillin at concentrations of 400–500 mg L⁻¹, efficient plant regeneration occurred. For this reason, we believe that cefotaxime and timentin in the concentrations analyzed here may be used in complex in vitro procedures or valuable carrot cultures as a prophylactic agent for prevention against occasional contaminations.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acarbenicillin 3acarrots 3acefotaxime 3acultivars 3aculture media 3aendo-1,4-beta-glucanase 3aplantlets 3aprotoplasts1 aSkop, Lukasz0 tIn vitro cellular & developmental biology.g2014 Oct., v. 50, no. 5 p.568-575dSpringer-Verlagx1054-54767nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11627-014-9626-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02947naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245009400166300001600260520152700276592002801803650002001831650001801851650002101869650001801890650001101908650001801919650001701937650001301954650001601967650002301983650002402006650002102030650002702051650001302078650001402091650001202105650000902117650001102126650000902137650001802146700001602164700002202180700002702202773013402229856008102363852000902444655001202453IND60082036820221117234444.0141015e201410  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008203682DNAL7 a10.1007/s11627-014-9628-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSingh, Aneesha10aHigh-Frequency Regeneration by Abscisic Acid (ABA) from Petiole Callus of Jatropha curcas  ap. 638-645.  aJatropha curcas L. is attaining worldwide interest as an important biofuel crop. Experiments were conducted to improve the prevailing micropropagation technique as well as to develop a new ex vitro rooting method for J. curcas plant regeneration. Regeneration and ex vitro rooting efficiency was enhanced by augmenting the culture medium with abscisic acid (ABA). Different concentrations of 6-benzylaminopurine (BAP) and indole-3-butyric acid (IBA) were tested for callus generation from both in vitro and in vivo explants (leaf and petiole) on Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium. The best regenerative callus was achieved on MS medium supplemented with BAP (4.44 μM) and IBA (2.45 μM) from in vitro-cultured petioles. Highest regeneration (91%) was achieved by culturing petiole callus on MS medium supplemented with BAP (8.88 μM), IBA (0.49 μM), and ABA (1.9 μM), whereas 61% regeneration was obtained from in vitro leaf callus. Shoot proliferation and elongation was achieved on BAP (2.22 μM) and IAA (8.56 μM) with 10–13 shoots per explants. Highest rooting (65%) was achieved from M1 shoots (BAP, IAA, and ABA) on MS medium supplemented with IBA (2.45 μM), naphthaleneacetic acid NAA (0.54 μM), and 0.02% activated charcoal. Ex vitro rooting of 1-mo-old M1 shoots obtained from the charcoal-containing medium resulted optimum rooting (>72%) when transferred to polybags containing sterile sand. The plantlets were successfully acclimatized in soil with more than 98% survival rate in the greenhouse.  aPublisher supplied data 3aJatropha curcas 3aabscisic acid 3aactivated carbon 3abenzyladenine 3acallus 3aculture media 3aenergy crops 3aexplants 3agreenhouses 3aindole acetic acid 3aindole butyric acid 3amicropropagation 3anaphthaleneacetic acid 3apetioles 3aplantlets 3arooting 3asand 3ashoots 3asoil 3asurvival rate1 aJani, Kruti1 aSagervanshi, Amit1 aAgrawal, Pradeep Kumar0 tIn vitro cellular & developmental biology.g2014 Oct., v. 50, no. 5 p.638-645dSpringer-VerlagwJournal:jnl47889x1054-54767nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11627-014-9628-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02007naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002300094024002200117024001900139040001800158100002800176245009700204300001500301520082500316592002801141650002301169650002101192650001101213650002201224650002001246700002101266700002101287773015201308856006901460856009601529990002301625852000901648655001201657IND60643180120221118045801.0190510e20181012xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064318012DNAL7 a10.3791/566532doi7 aPMC62355172pmcid7 a303716552pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBlacha-Grzechnik, Agata10aRaman and ir spectroelectrochemical methods as tools to analyze conjugated organic compounds  ap. e56653.  aIn the presented work, two spectroelectrochemical techniques are discussed as tools for the analysis of the structural changes occurring in the molecule on the vibrational level of energy.

The Australian members of the genus are revised here on the basis of extensive new collections, examination of specimens in herbaria and comprehensive review of the literature and available type material. The existing species Lamprothamnium macropogon (A.Braun) Ophel, L. inflatum (Fil. & G.O.Allen ex Fil.) A.García & Karol and L. heraldii A.García & Casanova are retained, eight new species are described (L. australicum Casanova, L. beilbyae Casanova, L. capitatum Casanova, L. compactum Casanova, L. coorongense Casanova, L. diminutum Casanova, L. macroanthum Casanova and L. stipitatum Casanova) and two taxa variously treated at infraspecific rank in Lychnothamnus are transferred to Lamprothamnium at species rank (L. cockajemmyense Casanova, L. tasmanicum (A.Braun) Casanova). Neither L. papulosum (Wallr.) J.Groves nor L. succinctum (A.Braun) R.D.Wood are confirmed for Australia after examination of the type material of these species. Species are distinguished by the arrangement of the gametangia, morphology of the fertile whorls and characteristics of the oospores. Four of these species are dioecious and nine are monoecious, which supports published conjectures concerning the biogeography of charophyte species (Proctor (1980): J.

Better knowledge of emigration behavior would assist in the conservation and management of coenobitid populations by helping identify and protect the habitats they need to complete their life cycles. We cultured laboratory‐born individuals of five coenobitid species (Coenobita cavipes, C. purpureus, C. rugosus, C. violascens, and Birgus latro) from megalopae to early juveniles (first, second, and/or third crabs) in vessels containing seawater and a hard substrate, and analyzed their behavior and molting in conjunction with our published data for C. brevimanus. Our results confirm that the coenobitids migrated from sea to land at the megalopal stage. Megalopae and early juveniles tended to select shells based on their body size. Inland‐dwelling coenobitids, such as C. brevimanus, C. cavipes, and B. latro, had a longer duration from landing to first molt and had a prolonged first crab intermolt period compared with those of the beach‐dwelling coenobitids C. purpureus, C. rugosus, and C. violascens, probably because of the adaptive traits for migrating to inland habitats. Little burrowing behavior was observed by megalopae of B. latro, but they had a strong tendency to be cryptic under shelters. Additionally, megalopae and early juveniles of Coenobita spp. created and utilized burrows somewhat differently. Our results suggest that coenobitids require specific microhabitats for completing their early life stages in the wild. In particular, megalopae of B. latro may need structurally complex refuges to migrate from the sea.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBirgus latro 3abody size 3aburrows 3acrabs 3ajuveniles 3alarvae 3amicrohabitats 3amolting 3aseawater1 aHatta, Sora1 aIshikawa, Takuma1 aYamashita, Shota1 aDan, Shigeki1 aKitada, Shuichi0 tInvertebrate biology.g2015 Dec., v. 134, no. 4 p.318-331dAllen Pressx1077-83067nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ivb.121073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02958naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002600150245013600176300001600312520145900328592002801787650001201815650001101827650001601838650001101854650003101865650002101896650001501917650001701932650001101949650001901960650001001979650002601989650001502015650002402030650002902054650001102083650001002094650001102104653002702115653001102142653001702153653002902170653000802199653001902207700002302226773009702249856008502346852000902431655001202440IND60705637720221118014030.0201024e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070563772DNAL7 a10.1016/j.renene.2020.06.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGopalakrishnan, Arthi10aSulfonated porous carbon nanosheets derived from oak nutshell based high-performance supercapacitor for powering electronic devices  ap. 173-183.  aIn this work, we report sulfonated porous carbon nanosheets (SPC) derived from waste oak nutshell withered from acorn trees for supercapacitor electrodes. The SPC is synthesized via facile acidic hydrothermal pre-carbonization to retain robust carbon network followed by KOH activation to achieve porous carbon. The detailed material characterization reveals that the optimized SPC possesses micro-mesopores distribution with sulfur doping and partially graphitized carbon. The optimized SPC as a supercapacitor electrode delivers excellent specific capacitance of 398 F g⁻¹ (0.4 A g⁻¹) in a three-cell electrode and exhibits an outstanding energy density of 17 Wh Kg⁻¹ (200 W kg⁻¹) with remarkable 97% capacitance retention after 10000 cycles in symmetric supercapacitor cell. The superior performance is ascribed to the heteroatom doping, interconnected porous carbon network, and mesopore inclusion. Moreover, the symmetric cell exhibits 98.5% retention of capacitance after 10000 cycles in the neutral electrolyte, indicating its high electrochemical stability of carbon framework. Also, it can power a 3.5 V commercial green light-emitting diode (LED) for 5 min successfully. The sustainable strategy of producing doped porous carbon with impressive specific capacitance, outstanding cyclic stability, and capability of powering electronic device demonstrates its promising potential towards high-valued energy storage material.  aPublisher supplied data 3aQuercus 3aacorns 3acapacitance 3acarbon 3aelectrochemical capacitors 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3aelectrolytes 3aenergy 3aenergy density 3ahulls 3alight emitting diodes 3ananosheets 3apotassium hydroxide 3arenewable energy sources 3asulfur 3atrees 3awastes 0aBiomass-derived carbon 0aPorous 0aSulfur-doped 0aSymmetric supercapacitor 0aLED 0aEnergy storage1 aBadhulika, Sushmee0 tRenewable energy.g2020 Dec., v. 161 p.173-183dElsevier LtdwJournal:11970x0960-14817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.renene.2020.06.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01869naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002300094024002200117024001900139040001800158100002000176245010300196300001500299520064300314592002800957650002100985650004901006650002501055650001501080650002201095700002501117700002101142773015201163856006901315856010301384990002301487852000901510655001201519IND60643180220221118045814.0190510e20181018xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064318022DNAL7 a10.3791/566562doi7 aPMC62355512pmcid7 a303943692pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPluczyk, Sandra10aUsing cyclic voltammetry, uv-vis-nir, and epr spectroelectrochemistry to analyze organic compounds  ap. e56656.  aCyclic voltammetry (CV) is a technique used in the analysis of organic compounds.

In several cases, insects cause-specific feeding damage with ensuing herbivore-associated molecular patterns that invoke characteristic defense responses. During feeding on plant tissue, insects release oral secretions (OSs) containing a repertoire of molecules affecting plant defense (effectors). Some of these OS components might elicit a defense response to combat insect attacks (elicitors), while some might curb the plant defenses (suppressors). Few reports suggest that the synthesis and function of OS components might depend on the host plant and associated microorganisms. We review these intricate plant-insect interactions, during which there is a continuous exchange of molecules between plants and feeding insects along with the associated microorganisms. We further provide a list of commonly identified inducible plant produced defensive molecules released upon insect attack as well as in response to OS treatments of the plants. Thus, we describe how plants specialized and defense-related metabolism is modulated at innumerable phases by OS during plant-insect interactions. A molecular understanding of these complex interactions will provide a means to design eco-friendly crop protection strategies.  aPublisher supplied data 3ahost plants 3ametabolism 3aphytophagous insects 3aplant biochemistry 3aplant protection 3aplant tissues 0aEffector 0aElicitor 0aHerbivore insects 0aOral secretion 0aPlant defense 0aSuppressor1 aArchana Kumari,1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7510-21811 aShinde, Balkrishna A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7806-54241 aGiri, Ashok P.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5309-259X0 tPhytochemistry.g2022 Jan., v. 193 p.113008-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl44710x0031-94227nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.phytochem.2021.1130083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02524naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001700143245009700160300001600257520132200273592002801595650002001623650002401643650001501667650000901682650001601691650002601707650002301733650000701756650001501763650001301778650002401791650002101815650001401836650001701850651001101867700001701878773013201895856007802027852000902105655001202114IND60765333820221118234434.0220419e20131201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076533382DNAL7 a10.17221/594/2013-pse2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNogalska, A.14aThe effect of meat and bone meal on phosphorus concentrations in soil and crop plants &nbsp;  ap. 575-580.  aA four-year field experiment was conducted in north-eastern Poland. The aim of the study was to determine the direct and residual effects of increasing doses of meat and bone meal (MBM) on the available phosphorus content of soil and the total phosphorus content in crops above ground biomass or grain. Experimental factor I was MBM dose (1.0, 1.5, 2.0 and 2.5 t/ha/year, and 2.0, 3.0, 4.0 and 5.0 t/ha/every second year), and experimental factor II was the year of the study (four consecutive years). The application of increasing MBM doses to slightly acidic soil insignificantly decreased its pH, but it did not change soil classification. The use of MBM as a fertilizer increased the levels of available phosphorus, compared to the treatments with mineral fertilization. The grain of winter triticale and winter wheat and the green matter of maize contained higher concentrations of phosphorus after the MBM application, in comparison to the plants receiving mineral fertilization. Phosphorus uptake by winter wheat and maize plants (dry matter basis) was higher in treatments with MBM (in particular applied every second year) than in treatments with NPK fertilization. Irrespective of the frequency of MBM application, phosphorus uptake by winter rapeseed was considerably lower, compared to the control plants.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNPK fertilizers 3aaboveground biomass 3aacid soils 3acorn 3aenvironment 3afield experimentation 3ameat and bone meal 3apH 3aphosphorus 3arapeseed 3asoil classification 3atotal phosphorus 3atriticale 3awinter wheat 3aPoland1 aZalewska, M.0 tPlant, Soil and Environment.g, v. 59, no. 12 p.575-580dCzech Academy of Agricultural ScienceswJournal:17122x1214-11787nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.17221/594/2013-pse3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03275naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094024001800123040001800141100002400159245012900183300001600312520143700328592002801765650001601793650003901809650003001848650000801878650001001886650001601896650001101912650002201923650002501945650001501970650000901985650001301994650001502007650002602022650002802048650001302076650002202089651001002111651001202121651001202133653001902145653002102164653001102185653003102196653000802227653002302235700002502258700001902283700002302302700002402325700001702349700002002366700001802386700002002404773012902424856007502553852000902628655001202637IND60597667720221122233409.0180625e201704  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059766772DNAL7 a10.7589/2015-12-3292doi4 ajwdi-53-02-15  aAGLbengcAGL1 aO'Brien, Michael P.10aBrucellosis Transmission between Wildlife and Livestock in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem: Inferences from DNA Genotyping  ap. 339-343.  aThe wildlife of the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem carries brucellosis, which was first introduced to the area by cattle in the 19th century. Brucellosis transmission between wildlife and livestock has been difficult to study due to challenges in culturing the causative agent, Brucella abortus. We examined B. abortus transmission between American bison (Bison bison), Rocky Mountain elk (Cervus elaphus nelsoni), and cattle (Bos taurus) using variable number tandem repeat (VNTR) markers on DNA from 98 B. abortus isolates recovered from populations in Idaho, Montana, and Wyoming, US. Our analyses reveal interspecies transmission. Two outbreaks (2007, 2008) in Montana cattle had B. abortus genotypes similar to isolates from both bison and elk. Nevertheless, similarity in elk and cattle isolates from the 2008 outbreak suggest that elk are the likely source of brucellosis transmission to cattle in Montana and Wyoming. Brucella abortus isolates from sampling in Montana appear to be divided in two clusters: one found in local Montana elk, cattle, and bison; and another found mainly in elk and a bison from Wyoming, which is consistent with brucellosis having entered Montana via migration of infected elk from Wyoming. Our findings illustrate complex patterns of brucellosis transmission among elk, bison, and cattle as well as the utility of VNTRs to infer the wildlife species of origin for disease outbreaks in livestock.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBison bison 3aBrucella melitensis biovar Abortus 3aCervus canadensis nelsoni 3aDNA 3abison 3abrucellosis 3acattle 3adisease outbreaks 3adisease transmission 3aecosystems 3aelks 3agenotype 3agenotyping 3aminisatellite repeats 3atandem repeat sequences 3awildlife 3awildlife diseases 3aIdaho 3aMontana 3aWyoming 0aAmerican bison 0aBrucella abortus 0acattle 0across-species transmission 0aelk 0ainfectious disease1 aBeja-Pereira, Albano1 aAnderson, Neil1 aCeballos, Ruben M.1 aEdwards, William H.1 aHarris, Beth1 aWallen, Rick L.1 aCosta, Vânia1 aLuikart, Gordon0 tJournal of wildlife diseases.g2017 Apr., v. 53, no. 2 p.339-343dWildife Disease AssociationwJournal:1978x0090-35587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.7589/2015-12-3293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03700naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245014400169300001600313520202000329592002802349650001602377650001602393650002502409650001702434650002502451650001602476650001302492650001602505650002002521650001302541650001802554650001202572650003602584650001602620650002402636650002402660650001102684650002102695650002102716650002102737650001902758650001402777650001202791650001002803650001402813650001102827650002502838650001802863650001602881700001902897773011602916856008103032852000903113655001203122IND60082037120221117234632.0141015e201410  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008203712DNAL7 a10.1007/s11627-014-9609-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAhmed, Md Rafique10aChanges in activity of antioxidant enzymes and photosynthetic machinery during acclimatization of micropropagated Cassia alata L. plantlets  ap. 601-609.  aThe stimulatory effect of thidiazuron (TDZ) has been investigated in shoot multiplication for a simple, efficient, rapid, and commercially applicable regeneration protocol of an important medicinal plant, Cassia alata. Furthermore, the effects of an increased photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) on photosynthesis, the functioning of the photosynthetic apparatus, and the response of the antioxidant enzymatic system were studied during the ex vitro establishment of micropropagated plantlets. Multiple shoots were induced by culturing nodal explants excised from an aseptic seedling on Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium supplemented with various concentrations (1.0, 2.5, 5.0, 7.5, or 10.0 μM) of TDZ for different treatment durations (2, 3, 4, or 6 wk). The highest number of shoots (17.9 ± 0.3) and longest shoot length (4.6 ± 0.1 cm) were achieved when explants were exposed to 5.0 μM TDZ for 4 wk and subsequently subcultured on growth regulator-free MS medium for 8 wk. In vitro rooting of isolated shoots was best achieved on full-strength MS medium containing 0.5 μM indole-3-butyric acid (IBA). The micropropagated shoots with well-developed roots were successfully established in pots containing Soilrite™ followed by garden soil and grown in greenhouse with an 85% survival rate. During the acclimatization period, significant changes in the activity of the antioxidant enzymatic system were observed. An increase in superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity was measured throughout the acclimatization period. Likewise an upregulation of catalase (CAT), ascorbate peroxidase (APX), and glutathione reductase (GR) enzyme activities were also observed. Pigment (chlorophyll a and b and carotenoids) content in ex vitro-formed leaves was significantly higher compared with those grown in vitro. These observed changes reflected the ability of plants to develop an antioxidant enzymatic defense system aiding in survival against oxidative stress and in reducing release of free radicals.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSenna alata 3aacclimation 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3aascorbate peroxidase 3acarotenoids 3acatalase 3achlorophyll 3aenzyme activity 3aexplants 3afree radicals 3agardens 3aglutathione-disulfide reductase 3agreenhouses 3ahorticultural soils 3aindole butyric acid 3aleaves 3amedicinal plants 3amicropropagation 3aoxidative stress 3aphotosynthesis 3aplantlets 3arooting 3aroots 3aseedlings 3ashoots 3asuperoxide dismutase 3asurvival rate 3athidiazuron1 aAnis, Mohammad0 tIn vitro cellular & developmental biology.g2014 Oct., v. 50, no. 5 p.601-609dSpringer-Verlagx1054-54767nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11627-014-9609-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02244naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245007000157300001800227520101100245592002801256650004401284650002201328650001401350650001301364650001101377650001801388650001101406650001401417650001101431650001301442650001301455700001301468700001401481700001801495700001901513700001401532700001501546700002401561773014201585856007401727852000901801655001201810IND60671058620221122041540.0191002e20150331xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067105862DNAL7 a10.1039/c5ta00502g2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWei, Qiulong10aHydrated vanadium pentoxide with superior sodium storage capacity  ap. 8070-8075.  aSodium ion batteries (SIBs), as potential candidates for large-scale energy storage systems, have attracted great attention from researchers. Herein, a V₂O₅·nH₂O xerogel composed of thin acicular interconnected nanowire networks has been synthesized via a facile freeze-drying process. The interlayer spacing of V₂O₅·nH₂O is larger than that of orthorhombic V₂O₅ due to the intercalation of water molecules into the layer structure. As the cathode of a SIB, V₂O₅·nH₂O exhibits a high initial capacity of 338 mA h g⁻¹ at 0.05 A g⁻¹ and a high-rate capacity of 96 mA h g⁻¹ at 1.0 A g⁻¹. On the basis of combining ex-situ XRD and FTIR spectroscopy, the Na⁺ ion intercalation storage reactions are discussed in detail. By modeling calculations, the pseudocapacitive behavior makes a great contribution to the high capacities. Our work demonstrates that V₂O₅·nH₂O with large interlayer spacing is a promising candidate for high capacity sodium-based energy storage.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3abatteries 3acathodes 3aenergy 3afreeze drying 3amodels 3ananowires 3asodium 3avanadium 3axerogels1 aLiu, Jin1 aFeng, Wei1 aSheng, Jinzhi1 aTian, Xiaocong1 aHe, Liang1 aAn, Qinyou1 aMai, L.q(Liqiang),0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2015 Mar. 31, v. 3, no. 15 p.8070-8075dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c5ta00502g3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02632naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245017400172300001600346520124900362592002801611650001701639650002201656650001101678650001201689650001201701650001601713650001701729650001101746650001201757650001101769651002101780653002301801653002601824653002601850653001901876653003301895653002201928700002401950700002101974773009701995856008502092852000902177655001202186IND60705638020221118014030.0201024e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070563802DNAL7 a10.1016/j.renene.2020.06.0832doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRaveendran, Visal10aAssessing the ancillary service potential of electric vehicles to support renewable energy integration in touristic islands: A case study from Balearic island of Menorca  ap. 495-509.  aThe potential of e-mobility to participate in intermittency flattening ancillary services (AS) to support solar photo-voltaic (PV) grid integration is analysed in this paper. First, the capability of Plug-in Electric Vehicles (PEVs) to act as Energy Storage Systems (ESS) based on daily energy storage potential (ESP) with and without vehicle-to-grid (V2G) services is studied. Mobility behaviour and penetration levels of various categories of vehicles-cars, vans, trucks, buses and motorcycles in the island are modeled using traffic data from Menorca island. Next, ancillary service (AS) potential of 1000 PEVs to support solar PV grid integration is analysed. A crucial parameter of PEVs to offer uni-V2G services under aggregator to participate in hour-ahead AS market, termed achievable power capacity (APC), is explored. Results showed that, for bidirectional V2G services in summer, ESP can reach up to 100 MWh for minimum (P1) and 375 MWh for maximum (P6) penetration levels considered. The regulation potential for every 1000 private PEVs aggregated to a maximum of 4.6 MW and reserve potential to a maximum of 5.25 MW under coordinated charging. This reveals the great potential of PEVs in offering AS in small touristic islands.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase studies 3aelectric vehicles 3aenergy 3aislands 3amarkets 3amotorcycles 3asolar energy 3asummer 3atraffic 3atrucks 3aBalearic Islands 0aAncillary services 0aElectric vehicle (EV) 0aVehicle-to-grid (V2G) 0aEnergy storage 0aRenewable energy integration 0aFrequency control1 aAlvarez-Bel, Carlos1 aNair, Manjula G.0 tRenewable energy.g2020 Dec., v. 161 p.495-509dElsevier LtdwJournal:11970x0960-14817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.renene.2020.06.0833Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02800naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001500147245010700162300001600269520155800285592002801843650001001871650002601881650001601907650001901923650001201942650001801954650001801972650001301990650001302003650001102016650001602027650002702043650001902070650001202089700001602101700001202117700001802129700001302147773011602160856008102276852000902357655001202366IND60082037220221117234647.0141015e201410  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008203722DNAL7 a10.1007/s11627-014-9610-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Qing10aEmbryogenesis and haploid induction using anther culture in lovage (Levisticum officinale W.D.J. Koch)  ap. 525-533.  aAn efficient and robust protocol to induce embryogenesis in lovage (Levisticum officinale W.D.J. Koch) has been developed. Immature anthers, with most of the microspores at the late uninucleate stage, were used as explants, and embryogenesis was induced in medium with combinations of plant growth regulators including α-naphthalene acetic acid (NAA), 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D), and 6-benzylaminopurine (BAP). The frequencies of in vitro embryogenesis ranged from 0.42 to 18.25% depending on the combinations of plant growth regulators in the induction medium. Induced globular embryos successfully developed into heart and torpedo-staged embryos. Fresh anther explants produced the highest embryo formation rate (17.75%). Anthers treated at 4 ºC for 3, 5, or 8 d, significantly reduced the embryogenic response (to 3.52–7.85%). More embryos were induced when the sucrose content in the medium was increased from 3 to 6% (w/v), but significantly fewer embryos were produced when sucrose was 8% or more. Nearly 20% of fresh anthers were able to produce embryogenic structures when cultured on Murashige and Skoog medium supplemented with 10.74 μM NAA, 8.80 μM BAP, 9.05 μM 2,4-D, and 6% sucrose. Furthermore, when silver nitrate was added to the embryo induction medium at 90 μM, the frequency of anther browning decreased by 30% and the embryo formation rate increased to 24.75% of anthers cultured. In total, 418 plants were regenerated and cytological analysis confirmed 11 haploid lines from 187 samples randomly selected.  aPublisher supplied data 3a2,4-D 3aLevisticum officinale 3aacetic acid 3aanther culture 3aanthers 3abenzyladenine 3aembryogenesis 3aexplants 3ahaploidy 3alovage 3amicrospores 3anaphthaleneacetic acid 3asilver nitrate 3asucrose1 aRan, Yidong1 aYu, Bin1 aChen, Xiaoyan1 aWang, Di0 tIn vitro cellular & developmental biology.g2014 Oct., v. 50, no. 5 p.525-533dSpringer-Verlagx1054-54767nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11627-014-9610-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03239naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245013400166300001600300520152900316592002801845650003401873650001001907650002501917650001301942650001301955650002001968650001401988650001502002650002102017650001002038650001302048650001502061650001202076650001702088650001002105651001102115653004302126653002402169653004802193653002202241653003302263653002002296700005702316700002002373700001902393700002102412700002102433700001802454773012302472856008102595852000902676655001202685IND60604617720221117183449.0180717e20150802xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060461772DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jep.2015.05.0382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYen, Hung-Rong10aPrescription patterns of Chinese herbal products for patients with uterine fibroid in Taiwan: A nationwide population-based study  ap. 223-230.  aUterine fibroid (myoma) is one of the most common diseases in women. Although there are several studies on the efficacy of Chinese herbs, there is a lack of large-scale survey on the use of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) for the treatment of uterine fibroid. This study aimed to investigate the utilization of Chinese herbal products for patients with uterine fibroid, prescribed by licensed TCM doctors in Taiwan.A random sample comprised of one million individuals with newly diagnosed uterine fibroid between 2002 and 2010 from the Taiwanese National Health Insurance Research Database was analyzed. Demographic characteristics, TCM usage, the frequency as well as average daily dose of Chinese herbal formulas and the single herbs prescribed for patients with uterine fibroid, were analyzed.Overall, 35,786 newly diagnosed subjects with uterine fibroid were included. Majority of these patients (87.1%; n=31,161) had visited TCM clinics. Among them, 61.8% of their visits used Chinese herbal remedies. Patients less than 45 years of age tended to use TCM more frequently than elder patients. Gui-Zhi-Fu-Ling-Wan (Cinnamon Twig and Poria Pill) was the most frequently prescribed Chinese herbal formula, while San-Leng (Rhizoma Sparganii) was the most commonly prescribed single herb.Our study identified the characteristics and prescription patterns of TCM for patients with uterine fibroid in Taiwan. Further basic mechanistic studies and clinical trials are needed to confirm the therapeutic effects and mechanisms.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOriental traditional medicine 3aPoria 3aaverage daily intake 3abranches 3acinnamon 3aclinical trials 3adatabases 3ademography 3ahealth insurance 3aherbs 3apatients 3aphysicians 3asurveys 3atherapeutics 3awomen 3aTaiwan 0aComplementary and alternative medicine 0aGui-Zhi-Fu-Ling-Wan 0aNational health insurance research database 0aRhizoma Sparganii 0aTraditional Chinese medicine 0aUterine fibroid1 aChen, Ying-Yu1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9344-30591 aHuang, Tzu-Ping1 aChang, Tung-Ti1 aTsao, Jung Ying,1 aChen, Bor-Chyuan1 aSun, Mao-Feng0 tJournal of ethnopharmacology.g2015 Aug. 02, v. 171 p.223-230dElsevier Ireland LtdwJournal:jnl30651x0378-87417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jep.2015.05.0383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03308naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001500150245018800165300001600353520160300369592002801972650002502000650001702025650001402042650001502056650001402071650001102085650001902096650001402115650001802129650002102147650002002168650001002188650002702198650002302225650002002248650001802268650001302286650002102299650001402320653001402334653001702348653001602365653001902381653000902400653001402409700001502423700001402438700001702452700001402469700001502483700001502498773011202513856008402625852000902709655001202718IND60122515620221118052330.0150325e20140403xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012251562DNAL7 a10.1080/09712119.2013.8238642doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJang, H.Y.10aBeneficial effects of silymarin against nitric oxide-induced oxidative stress on cell characteristics of bovine oviduct epithelial cell and developmental ability of bovine IVF embryos  ap. 166-176.  aThe antioxidative effects of silymarin were examined against nitric oxide-induced oxidative stress on cell characteristics of bovine oviduct epithelial cell (BOEC) and developmental rates of bovine in vitro fertilisation (IVF) embryos. The cell viability and morphology in BOEC which were treated with sodium nitroprusside (SNP) declined, as concentrations of SNP increase. The additions of silymarin 50, 100 and 200 µM into SNP 1000 µM increased the cell viability inhibited by SNP 1000 µM alone, but addition of silymarin 500 µM into SNP 1000 µM group did not recover the inhibitory effect of SNP 1000 µM (p< 0.05). The levels of malondialdehyde (MDA), as the indicator of lipid peroxidation (LPO) in the treatments of SNPs increased with dose-dependant manners (p< 0.05), whereas additions of silymarin 50, 100 and 200 µM into SNP 1000 µM significantly decreased MDA levels by 1.6, 1.4 and 1.3 folds of control (p< 0.05). Antioxidant and Bcl-2 genes were expressed in control or SNP 1000 µM plus silymarin 200 µM treatment group, whereas pro-apoptotic genes (caspase-3 and Bax) were expressed only in SNP treatment groups. When bovine IVF embryos were co-cultured with BOEC supplemented with silymarin in the presence or absence of SNP, the development ability to blastocyst in 200 µM of silymarin alone was the highest among all treatments. These results suggest that silymarin has positive effects on cell characteristics such as viability, morphology and LPO of BOEC, and the increase of bovine IVF embryo development rate might be through antioxidative and anti-apoptotic actions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3aapoptosis 3ablastocyst 3acaspase-3 3acattle 3acell viability 3acoculture 3aembryogenesis 3aepithelial cells 3agene expression 3agenes 3ain vitro fertilization 3alipid peroxidation 3amalondialdehyde 3anitroprusside 3aoviducts 3aoxidative stress 3asilymarin 0asilymarin 0anitric oxide 0aantioxidant 0abovine embryos 0aBOEC 0aapoptosis1 aPark, I.C.1 aYuh, I.S.1 aCheong, H.T.1 aKim, J.T.1 aPark, C.K.1 aYang, B.K.0 tJournal of applied animal research.g2014 Apr. 3, v. 42, no. 2 p.166-176dTaylor & Francisx0974-18447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09712119.2013.8238643Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02789naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001600142245009000158300001600248520165300264592002801917650003501945650001001980650001401990650002702004650001302031650001502044650002402059650001302083650001002096651001902106700001702125700001602142700001702158700001502175773012702190856007702317852000902394655001202403IND60765334120221118234207.0220904e20120601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076533412DNAL7 a10.17221/5951-vetmed2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPavlata, L.10a&nbsp;Direct and indirect assessment of selenium status in sheep &ndash; a comparison  ap. 219-223.  aThe aim of this study was to determine the relationship between selenium concentration and activity of glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) in the whole blood of sheep and reference ranges for the activity of GSH-Px for evaluation of the selenium status of sheep in the Czech Republic. Selenium concentration and activity of glutathione peroxidase were determined in whole blood samples collected from 92 sheep in six herds. The GSH-Px activity in the samples was measured using the photometric method. Selenium in the sample was measured using the hydride technique atomic absorption spectrometry. Data on both parameters were processed using correlation and regression analysis in order to obtain reference values of GSH-Px for the indirect evaluation of the selenium status of sheep. The two variables showed a close and significant correlation (r = 0.95; P < 0.01). The regression line, defined by the equation y = 7.5857x &ndash; 121.87 (linear) or y = &ndash;0.0167x<sup>2</sup> + 11.993x &ndash; 355.57 (polynomial), allowed us to determine the GSH-Px activity of 637, resp. 677 &mu;kat/l as equivalent to selenium concentration in whole blood of sheep 100 &mu;g/l. Mean selenium concentration and mean GSH-Px activity found in whole blood samples were 123.42 &plusmn; 57.84 &mu;g/l and 814.34 &plusmn; 463.64 &mu;kat/l, respectively. In this study, a close dependence of GSH-Px activity on the selenium concentration in the blood of sheep was found. Activity values of GSH-Px were determined for use in the diagnosis of sufficient selenium status in sheep in the Czech Republic (GSH-Px activity greater than 600 &mu;kat/l of whole blood). &nbsp;  aPublisher supplied data 3aatomic absorption spectrometry 3ablood 3aequations 3aglutathione peroxidase 3ahydrides 3aphotometry 3aregression analysis 3aselenium 3asheep 3aCzech Republic1 aMisurova, L.1 aPechova, A.1 aHusakova, T.1 aDvorak, R.0 tVeterinární medicína.g, v. 57, no. 5 p.219-223dCzech Academy of Agricultural ScienceswJournal:21422x0375-84277nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.17221/5951-vetmed3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02694naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002300094024002200117024001900139040001800158100002500176245004300201300001500244520118500259592002801444650002401472650001501496650002001511650001301531650001301544650001201557650001301569650002301582650001001605650002001615650001201635650001101647650001101658700002601669700002401695700002301719700002401742700001801766700002401784700001901808700002201827773015201849856006902001856007402070990002302144852000902167655001202176IND60643180520221118045913.0190510e20180817xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064318052DNAL7 a10.3791/567052doi7 aPMC61281062pmcid7 a301760052pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDouglas, Jennifer E.10aTaste exam: a brief and validated test  ap. e56705.  aThe emerging importance of taste in medicine and biomedical research, and new knowledge about its genetic underpinnings, has motivated us to supplement classic taste-testing methods in two ways. First, we explain how to do a brief assessment of the mouth, including the tongue, to ensure that taste papillae are present and to note evidence of relevant disease. Second, we draw on genetics to validate taste test data by comparing reports of perceived bitterness intensity and inborn receptor genotypes. Discordance between objective measures of genotype and subjective reports of taste experience can identify data collection errors, distracted subjects or those who have not understood or followed instructions. Our expectation is that fast and valid taste tests may persuade researchers and clinicians to assess taste regularly, making taste testing as common as testing for hearing and vision. Finally, because many tissues of the body express taste receptors, taste responses may provide a proxy for tissue sensitivity elsewhere in the body and, thereby, serve as a rapid, point-of-care test to guide diagnosis and a research tool to evaluate taste receptor protein function.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiomedical research 3abitterness 3adata collection 3agenetics 3agenotype 3ahearing 3amedicine 3asensory evaluation 3ataste 3ataste receptors 3atissues 3atongue 3avision1 aMansfield, Corrine J.1 aArayata, Charles J.1 aCowart, Beverly J.1 aColquitt, Lauren R.1 aMaina, Ivy W.1 aBlasetti, Mariel T.1 aCohen, Noam A.1 aReed, Danielle R.0 tJournal of visualized experiments.g2018 Aug. 17, , no. 138 p.e56705-e56705dJournal of Visualized ExperimentswJournal:jnl4469330x1940-087X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3791/567053Available from publisher's site  uhttp://www.jove.com/video/56705/taste-exam-a-brief-and-validated-test  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02028naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100003300150245008700183300001600270500001500286520072300301592002801024650001501052650002301067650001201090650002501102650001301127650003301140650001901173650002201192651001201214651001201226651001101238651001301249651001401262653002901276653001701305653002301322653002501345700002501370773009401395856008401489852000901573655001201582IND60121940820221120111023.0150325e20120901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012194082DNAL7 a10.1080/0269249X.2012.6964952doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOgnjanova-Rumenova, Nadja G.10aMorphology and ultrastructure of the fossil freshwater diatom Aulacoseira temperei  ap. 107-119.  a2019-12-04  aOriginal material of Melosira temperei Pantocsek from Neogene lacustrine deposits in the Transylvanian Basin, Romania was studied using light and scanning electron microscopy.

Among the two microbial fuel cell (MFC) types, the one containing biocathode showed higher power density (54 mW/m²), current density (122 mA/m²) coulombic efficiency (33%), and substrate removal efficiency (94%) than the abiotic cathode containing MFC. Voltammetric analysis also witnessed higher and sustainable electron discharge for the MFC with biocathode, when compared with the abiotic cathode MFC. Over the tested period, both MFC have shown a cell voltage drop, after 150 and 165, days, for the MFC with biocathode and abiotic cathodes, respectively. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) based restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis identified 281 clones.

PEGylation (PEG: poly(ethylene glycol)) of CL–DNA complexes by addition of PEG2000-lipids yields sterically stabilized nanoparticles but strongly reduces their gene delivery efficacy. PEGylation-induced weakening of the electrostatic binding of CL–DNA nanoparticles to cells (leading to reduced uptake) has been considered as a possible cause, but experimental results have been ambiguous. Using quantitative live-cell imaging in vitro, we have investigated cell attachment and uptake of PEGylated CL–DNA nanoparticles with and without a custom synthesized RGD-peptide grafted to the distal ends of PEG2000-lipids. The RGD-tagged nanoparticles exhibit strongly increased cellular attachment as well as uptake compared to nanoparticles without grafted peptide. Transfection efficiency of RGD-tagged PEGylated CL–DNA NPs increases by about an order of magnitude between NPs with low and high membrane charge density (σM; the average charge per unit area of the membrane; controlled by the molar ratio of cationic to neutral lipid), even though imaging data show that uptake of RGD-tagged particles is only slightly enhanced by high σM. This suggests that endosomal escape and, as a result, transfection efficiency of RGD-tagged NPs is facilitated by high σM. We present a model describing the interactions between PEGylated CL–DNA nanoparticles and the anionic cell membrane which shows how the PEG grafting density and membrane charge density affect adhesion of nanoparticles to the cell surface.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acell membranes 3agene therapy 3aimage analysis 3amodels 3ananoparticles 3apolyethylene glycol 3atransfection 0aGene therapy 0aLive cell imaging 0aLiposome 0aNanoparticle 0aPolyethylene glycol 0aRGD peptide1 aChan, Chia-Ling1 aEwert, Kai K.1 aSilva, Bruno F.B.1 aLiang, Keng S.1 aJacovetty, Erica L.1 aCarragher, Bridget1 aPotter, Clinton S.1 aSafinya, Cyrus R.0 tBiomaterials.g2014 June, v. 35, no. 18 p.4996-5005dElsevier LtdwJournal:11782x0142-96127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biomaterials.2014.03.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02593naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001900149245005100168300001600219500000900235520133200244592002801576650002301604650002101627650001701648650002801665650001101693650001501704650001901719650002101738650001801759650002101777650001301798650001101811650002001822650001401842650002401856650001901880651001001899700002401909773012101933856008402054852000902138655001202147IND60665547020221120131218.0191228e200103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066554702DNAL7 a10.2135/cropsci2001.412577x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSmith, C.Wayne10aVitamin e concentration in upland cotton seeds  ap. 577-579.  aepub  aVitamin E, tocopherol, is a naturally occurring antioxidant that has been implicated in human health issues such as decreased risk of cardiovascular disease and some forms of cancer, improved immune functions, and in slowing the progress of degenerative diseases. Tocopherol affects plant health much as it does human health, i.e., by scavenging free radicals, thus protecting plant membrane integrity. Tocopherol is a strong antioxidant and increases oil oxidative stability in cottonseed oil. Little is known about the tocopherol content of cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) seed. ‘Acala 1517-88’ and ‘Acala 1517-SR2’ are reportedly higher in α-tocopherol than ‘Deltapine 50’ or ‘Stoneville 825.’ Objectives of this research were to determine the variability in vitamin E content among several current upland cotton genotypes grown during 1997 and 1998 at College Station, TX, and when grown at College Station and Chillicothe, TX, in 1997. Tocopherol was extracted from cotton seeds with hexane and levels were determined by HPLC. Years were significant for α- and δ-tocopherol and location was significant for β/γ-tocopherol. However, no differences were detected among 18 genotypes grown during 1997 and 1998 at College Station nor among 13 genotypes grown at College Station and Chillicothe during 1997.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGossypium hirsutum 3aalpha-tocopherol 3aantioxidants 3acardiovascular diseases 3acotton 3acottonseed 3acottonseed oil 3adelta-tocopherol 3afree radicals 3agamma-tocopherol 3agenotype 3ahexane 3aimmune response 3aneoplasms 3aoxidative stability 3arisk reduction 3aTexas1 aCreelman, Robert A.0 tCrop science.g2001 Mar., v. 41, no. 2 p.577-579dCrop Science Society of AmericawJournal:jnl44570x0011-183X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2135/cropsci2001.412577x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02833naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094040001800138100001800156245010800174300001800282520128600300592002801586650002201614650001301636650001401649650001701663650000901680650001401689650002001703650001901723650001201742650002001754650001501774653002501789653002701814653001501841653001801856653003001874653004601904700002001950700005801970700001702028700001802045700005802063700001702121773010202138856009002240852000902330655001202339IND60599701620221120061019.0180702e201406  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059970162DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biomaterials.2014.03.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChoi, Jae Won10aSmall intestine submucosa and mesenchymal stem cells composite gel for scarless vocal fold regeneration  ap. 4911-4918.  aThe purpose of this study is to demonstrate scarless vocal fold (VF) regeneration by using a composite gel composed of small intestine submucosa (SIS) and mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). A scar was made with an electrocoagulator on both VFs in 24 rabbits, followed by injection of either MSCs, SIS, or MSCs-SIS composite gel in the right side VF, while the left side VF was left untreated. VF scars were evaluated with in vivo fluorescence live imaging system (IFLIS), endoscopy, histology, and videokymography (VKG) after eight weeks. IFLIS demonstrated that SIS enabled the MSCs to survive and be engrafted in the VF. The histological analysis showed increased hyaluronic acid accumulation and controlled collagen deposition by MSCs-SIS composite gel. VKG analysis showed more favorable vibrations of MSCs-SIS injected VF, compared to other treatment group. In conclusion, the injectable SIS supplied a niche for the MSCs to stably settle down in scarred VFs and helped to regulate ECM synthesis. The ECM remodeling underwent by the surviving MSCs eventually led to the functional improvement of the VF. The results of the present investigation suggest that SIS-MSCs composite gel is a plausible biomaterial for prolonged survival of MSCs in VFs and promotes scarless VF healing.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiobased products 3acollagen 3aendoscopy 3afluorescence 3agels 3ahistology 3ahyaluronic acid 3aimage analysis 3arabbits 3asmall intestine 3astem cells 0aExtracellular matrix 0aMesenchymal stem cells 0aVocal fold 0aWound healing 0aSmall intestine submucosa 0aIn vivo fluorescence live imaging system1 aPark, Ju Kyeong1 aChang, Jae Won1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6596-931x1 aKim, Da Yeon1 aKim, Moon Suk1 aShin, Yoo Seob1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2007-11001 aKim, Chul-Ho0 tBiomaterials.g2014 June, v. 35, no. 18 p.4911-4918dElsevier LtdwJournal:11782x0142-96127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biomaterials.2014.03.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03486naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001600148245010200164300001600266520175300282592002802035596005902063596007502122596010002197650001802297650001402315650001502329650001902344650002402363650000902387650002202396650002602418650001902444650001402463650001302477650002902490650002302519650001202542650003702554700001602591700001802607700001802625700001302643700002002656700005402676700001802730773012802748856008302876852000902959655001202968IND60781290920221116161917.0220628e202206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078129092DNAL7 a10.1007/s11104-022-05381-w2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPan, Wankun10aPlant–microbial competition for amino acids depends on soil acidity and the microbial community  ap. 457-471.  aPURPOSE: Soil acidification influences competitive N uptake between plants and microorganisms. The mechanisms by which soil acidification affects competition between maize and microorganisms for organic N must be determined to understand N cycling and adjust the forms and levels of N fertilisation. METHODS: The uptake of glycine, mineral N after glycine decomposition, and NH₄⁺ by maize and microorganisms was investigated using ¹³C and ¹⁵N labelling. Microbial community composition biomarkers were analysed using phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) analysis. Mineralisation of organic N was monitored via CO₂ production, and gross NH₄⁺/NO₃⁻ production and consumption was assessed using ¹⁵N pool dilution. RESULTS: Soil acidification (pH from 7.6 to 5.1) increased the intact glycine uptake by maize roots (from 0.7 to 2.4% of added ¹⁵N) but decreased its uptake by microorganisms (from 32 to 2.4% of added ¹⁵N). Soil acidification altered the microbial community composition: the PLFA of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi and anaerobes decreased by 6- and 1.5-fold, respectively. Soil acidification reduced the decomposition rates of proteins, peptides, and amino acids as indicated by the CO₂ release. This corresponded to a gross NH₄⁺ production increase by 1.3-fold and a gross NO₃⁻ production decrease by 97%, compared with soil at pH 7.1. CONCLUSIONS: Acidification led to decreased microbial biomass, shift in the microbial community, and the strong decrease (10–15-fold) in amino acid uptake by microorganisms, and was beneficial to maize plants, which assimilated 2.4% of the N added as glycine. However, these quantities of N are insufficient for a substantial increase in the N nutrition of the plants.  aPublisher supplied data  a31872180cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a2020YFD1100402cNational Key Research and Development Program of China  a89-DON 1cWest-Siberian Interregional Science and Education Center’s project “TerrArctic” 3aacidification 3aanaerobes 3abiomarkers 3acarbon dioxide 3acommunity structure 3acorn 3amicrobial biomass 3amicrobial communities 3amineralization 3anutrition 3apeptides 3aphospholipid fatty acids 3asoil acidification 3asoil pH 3avesicular arbuscular mycorrhizae1 aTang, Sheng1 aZhou, Jingjie1 aLiu, Mengjiao1 aXu, Meng1 aKuzyakov, Yakov1 aMa, Qingxu1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2050-77251 aWu, Lianghuan0 tPlant and soil.g2022 June, v. 475, no. 1-2 p.457-471dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl49373x0032-079X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11104-022-05381-w3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02566naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245016300163300001800326520111000344592002801454650003001482650001401512650002101526650001501547650001601562650001901578650002801597650002801625650002301653650002001676650001301696650002401709650001801733650000901751650003701760650001901797650002001816650001401836650001501850700001901865700001901884773010301903856008102006852000902087655001202096IND60086494720221120103221.0141101e201211  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008649472DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fct.2012.08.0252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee, Eun-Ju10aLuteolin exerts anti-tumor activity through the suppression of epidermal growth factor receptor-mediated pathway in MDA-MB-231 ER-negative breast cancer cells  ap. 4136-4143.  aThis study investigated the inhibitory effect of luteolin on MDA-MB-231 estrogen receptor (ER) negative breast tumor growth both in vitro and in vivo. Study results showed that luteolin suppresses ³H thymidine incorporation indicating cell growth inhibition, and this was accompanied by cell cycle arrest at the G2/M and S stages and apoptotic activity. Further analyses showed that luteolin exhibited cell cycle arrest and apoptotic activity by decreasing AKT, PLK1, cyclin B₁, cyclin A, CDC2, CDK2, and Bcl-xL expression and increasing p21 and Bax expression. Underlying mechanisms of action exerted by luteolin included the down-regulation. EGFR mRNA expression followed by the inhibition of EGF-induced MAPK activation, including the phosphorylation of ERK, p38 and AKT. Luteolin-supplementation at 0.01% or 0.05% significantly reduced tumor burden in nude mice inoculated with MDA-MB-231 cells. In conclusion, luteolin effectively suppresses MDA-MB-231 ER-negative breast cancer cell growth, and its anticancer activity may be partly derived from inhibitory effects on EGFR-mediated cell survival.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanticarcinogenic activity 3aapoptosis 3abreast neoplasms 3acell cycle 3acell growth 3acell viability 3acyclin-dependent kinase 3aepidermal growth factor 3aestrogen receptors 3agene expression 3aluteolin 3amechanism of action 3amessenger RNA 3amice 3amitogen-activated protein kinase 3aneoplasm cells 3aphosphorylation 3athymidine 3atoxicology1 aOh, Seung-Yeon1 aSung, Mi-Kyung0 tFood and chemical toxicology.g2012 Nov., v. 50, no. 11 p.4136-4143dElsevier Ltdx0278-69157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fct.2012.08.0253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02404naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005100094040001800145100002100163245005100184300001600235500000900251520133700260592002801597650001601625650000901641650001201650650002401662650001401686650001601700650001501716650001001731650002301741650001301764650001001777700001601787773012001803856009801923852000902021655001202030IND60665547120221120120829.0191122e197905  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066554712DNAL7 a10.2135/cropsci1979.0011183X001900030009x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKenworthy, W.

The criteria were seed yield per se, efficiency expressed as the ratio seed weight]straw weight, and an index in which the ranks of the components seed yield and efficiency were weighted equally. Selection was based on S₁ progeny performance in a replicated nine-hill plot grown at one location. Composites of S₃ seeds from selected St progenies from each cycle within the three selection criteria were evaluated in four environments with 12 replications per environment to compare the effectiveness of each selection criterion for yield response. Only selection for seed yield per se was effective in significantly increasing the yield of the base population. An average yield increase of 134 ± 30 kg/ha/cyde of selection was observed for seed yield per se and 38 ± 55 kg/ha/cycle for the index. Yield decreased an average of 2 ± 47 kg/ha/cycle for selection based on efficiency. Selection for seed yield per se had no significant effect on the unselected traits of seed size, percent oil, and percent protein. The favorable yield response observed in this recurrent selection program suggests that this breeding scheme may be used to develop populations of greater diversity and productivity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGlycine max 3aoils 3aprogeny 3arecurrent selection 3aseed size 3aseed weight 3aseed yield 3aseeds 3aselection criteria 3asoybeans 3astraw1 aBrim, C.

Thus, the development of rapid, environmentally-friendly, economical and reliable assessment methods is challenging. Soil proximal sensors have become an important approach for SOM prediction worldwide, but require regional calibration. This work aimed to assess the efficiency of SOM content prediction using the Nix Pro™ color sensor and portable X-ray fluorescence (pXRF) spectrometry, either separately or combined. The type of soil horizon collected (A or B) was used as auxiliary input data. A total of 705 Brazilian variable soil samples were analyzed in the laboratory for SOM content and scanned by Nix Pro™ and pXRF. Via Nix Pro™, samples were analyzed both dry and moist since moisture changes their color. Prediction models were built using 70% of the data via the stepwise multiple linear regression (SMLR), support vector machine with linear kernel (SVM) and random forest (RF). Validation was performed with the remaining 30% of the data through the coefficient of determination (R²), the root mean square error (RMSE) and the residual prediction deviation (RPD). SOM content was predicted with good accuracy (R² = 0.73, RMSE = 1.09% and RPD = 2.00) using the RF algorithm trained with combined data from the Nix Pro™ and pXRF sensors. Soil horizons and Ca content were the two most important predictor variables. The combination of data obtained by Nix Pro™ and pXRF yielded accurate SOM predictions for a wide variety of Brazilian soils, in addition to being environmentally-friendly, without generating chemical waste.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-radiation 3aX-ray fluorescence spectroscopy 3acolor 3afluorescence 3aprediction 3aregression analysis 3asoil horizons 3asoil organic matter 3asupport vector machines 3awastes 0aProximal sensors 0aRandom forest 0apXRF 0aSoil color 0aSoil modeling, tropical soils 0aSOM 0apXRF 0aSMLR 0aSVM 0aRF 0aR2 0aRMSE 0aRPD 0aCEC 0aSOC 0aVis-NIR 0aLED 0aMG 0aRJ 0aSP 0aSC 0aADFE 0aSDD 0aNIST 0aCS 0aSD 0aCV 0aVIF 0a%IncMSE1 aSilva, Sérgio Henrique Godinho1 aAndrade, Renata1 aMancini, Marcelo1 aMelo, Leônidas Carrijo Azevedo1 aWeindorf, David C.1 aGuilherme, Luiz Roberto Guimarães1 aCuri, Nilton0 tGeoderma regional.g2022 Mar., v. 28 p.e00461-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23258x2352-00947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.geodrs.2021.e004613Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02746naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094040001800138100001200156245014500168300001800313520145600331592002801787650002401815650001901839650000901858650002101867650001301888653001001901653002101911653001801932653002501950653002401975700002401999700002402023700002402047700002302071700002102094700002002115773010202135856009002237852000902327655001202336IND60599701920221120082322.0180702e201406  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059970192DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biomaterials.2014.03.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWen, Yi10aCoassembly of amphiphilic peptide EAK16-II with histidinylated analogues and implications for functionalization of β-sheet fibrils in vivo  ap. 5196-5205.  aEAK16-II (AEAEAKAKAEAEAKAK) is one of the first building blocks of environmentally responsive materials. This self-assembling peptide undergoes solution-to-gel transition when transferred from a low to high ionic strength environment. Previously we have demonstrated the histidinylated analogue EAKIIH6 (AEAEAKAKAEAEAKAKHHHHHH) coassembles with the parent peptide to render His-tags as a functionalization mechanism in vitro and in vivo. The present study aimed to understand the pathways by which the analogue coassembles with EAK16-II. The results presented herein suggested two competing but not mutually exclusive events in the coassembly. Atomic force microscopic and gel electrophoretic data showed that EAKIIH6 self-sorted to high molecular weight species without EAK16-II. Self-sorting of EAKIIH6 was inhibited by the parent peptide in a concentration dependent manner. Injecting mixtures containing EAKIIH6 subcutaneously rendered His-tags detectable in live mice for at least 312 h, despite diluting the histidinylated analogue by 10–50 folds compared to a previous formulation. The study provided a formulation by which in vivo display of His-tags was attained without excess amphiphilic peptides. By increasing coassembling efficiency, the likelihood of generating immunogenic aggregates outside the main fibrils could be minimized. These findings provide insights for rational functionalization of in situ self-gelling materials.  aPublisher supplied data 3agel electrophoresis 3aionic strength 3amice 3amolecular weight 3apeptides 0aEAK16 0aCross-β fibrils 0aSelf-assembly 0aAmphiphilic peptides 0aProtein formulation1 aRoudebush, Shana L.1 aBuckholtz, Gavin A.1 aGoehring, Thomas R.1 aGiannoukakis, Nick1 aGawalt, Ellen S.1 aMeng, Wilson S.0 tBiomaterials.g2014 June, v. 35, no. 19 p.5196-5205dElsevier LtdwJournal:11782x0142-96127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biomaterials.2014.03.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01794naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245011300158300001800271520068700289592002800976650001101004650002301015650001301038650002201051650001301073650001301086650001701099700001601116700001601132700001301148700001301161700001601174700001401190773013301204856007401337852000901411655001201420IND60655977920221120025925.0190808e20190807xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065597792DNAL7 a10.1039/c9cc04036f2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMeng, Lingkun10aSynthesis of a 2D nitrogen-rich π-conjugated microporous polymer for high performance lithium-ion batteries  ap. 9491-9494.  aNovel 2D graphene analogues with high conductivity are highly demanded as anode materials for lithium-ion batteries (LIBs).

To reduce labor costs, breeders often use a multiple-seed procedure in which a single pod rather than a single seed is harvested from each plant and bulked. This paper studied the distribution of the proportion of original F₂ plants represented after advancing populations ranging from 100 to 600 plants from the F₂ to the F₆ generation when the multiple-seed procedure of SSD is used. Since the analytical solution to this problem is intractable, involving a 4-fold convolution of a hypergeometric distribution, a simulation was run in SAS to estimate this probability distribution. An increase in the size of the population advanced from the F₂ to the F₆ generation did not influence significantly the mean proportion of F₂ plants represented in the F₆ generation but decreased its variability. An increase in the number of seed per pod from two to six reduced the mean proportion of F₂ plants represented in the F₆ generation from 0.45 to 0.35, but did not decrease significantly the standard deviations of the distributions. Using the multiple-seed procedure, grain legume breeders could expect, on the average, that at least every third F₆ line would be derived from a different F₂ plant. This should generate considerable genetic variability for the selection for quantitatively inherited traits such as seed yield.  aPublisher supplied data 3agenetic variation 3ainheritance (genetics) 3alegumes 3apopulation size 3aprobability distribution 3aseed yield 3astandard deviation 3awages and remuneration1 aBeaver, James S.0 tCrop science.g2001 Sept., v. 41, no. 5 p.1513-1516dCrop Science Society of AmericawJournal:jnl44570x0011-183X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2135/cropsci2001.4151513x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02400naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002100152245011100173300001600284520115000300592002801450650001101478650001301489650001201502650001801514650001901532650001401551650002001565650002501585650001501610653001201625653000901637653001701646653002001663653002401683700001801707700001901725700002101744773011701765856008701882852000901969655001201978IND50060620320221119132641.0190318e201305  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006062032DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jfoodeng.2012.12.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPatel, Jaimin S.10aFouling behaviour of milk and whey protein isolate solution on doped diamond-like carbon modified surfaces  ap. 413-421.  aDoped diamond-like carbon (DLC) coated stainless steel surfaces were studied for their fouling behaviour with milk and whey protein isolate (WPI) solution at both laboratory and pilot-scale. Stainless steel (316 SS 2B) surfaces were modified with three different doped DLC coatings (DLC-1, DLC-2 and DLC-3) using plasma assisted chemical vapour deposition. At the laboratory-scale, the DLC-1 coated surface showed a statistically significant reduction in the mass of milk fouling deposits. However, at the pilot-scale, none of the modified surfaces offered significant benefit in fouling mitigation over the control stainless steel surface. Subsequently, in the laboratory-scale trials with a whey protein isolate (WPI) solution, the mass of fouling deposits for all doped DLC modified surfaces were about 35–40% lower in comparison to their controls when fouled for 120min. However, these benefits were reduced to less than 15% with longer fouling duration. Thus, the results obtained in this study found no commercial benefit of modified surfaces in fouling mitigation when fouled for longer times with skim milk, whole milk or WPI solution.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3acoatings 3afouling 3amilk deposits 3arisk reduction 3askim milk 3astainless steel 3awhey protein isolate 3awhole milk 0aFouling 0aMilk 0aWhey protein 0aSurface coating 0aDiamond-like carbon1 aBansal, Bipan1 aJones, Mark I.1 aHyland, Margaret0 tJournal of food engineering.g2013 May, v. 116, no. 2 p.413-421dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl34294x0260-87747nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jfoodeng.2012.12.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02015naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245011800166300001600284520045600300592002800756650002000784650001600804650001300820650003600833650001100869650001400880650002100894650002800915650001400943653001300957653002300970653002600993700001601019700002001035700002501055700002101080700001801101700002101119700002901140700003301169700001801202700002301220700002601243700002001269773012901289856008201418852000901500655001201509IND60517295920221118152447.0190803e201208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051729592DNAL7 a10.1017/S14792621120001592doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCockram, James10aScreening a diverse collection of Artemisia annua germplasm accessions for the antimalarial compound, artemisinin  ap. 152-154.  aThe antimalarial drug artemisinin (ART) is commercially extracted from the medicinal plant Artemisia annua L.

Here we aimed to identify soil gradients related to climate, management and main species in wet heathlands. METHODS: Soil nutrient levels, organic matter and acidity were studied at two soil depths on ninety plots from 18 sites in Erica mackayana wet heaths of NW Iberian Peninsula, in relation to presence and cover of structural plant species (shrubs and graminoids) at two scales: plot and site (landscape) scale. RESULTS: We identified one main soil gradient explained by soil organic matter (SOM), the effective cation exchange complex (eCEC), available phosphorus (P), and Aluminium-Calcium ratio (Al:Ca). Cattle density had a positive correlation with the main gradient in the surface layer, all other climate and management factors were unrelated to soil conditions. Molinia caerulea had a positive relation with SOM, eCEC, basic cations and low Al:Ca ratio. Erica cinerea showed the opposite reaction at both scales. Ulex gallii showed a negative correlation with C:N ratio at the plot scale and deeper layer. CONCLUSION: SOM accumulation, low nutrient levels and Al toxicity explain the uniqueness of E. mackayana heathland vegetation and soils. Main indicator species react to soil conditions at plot and landscape scales. Cattle density correlated positively with soil nutrient levels, but density of wild ponies is unrelated to soil conditions. Large herbivores, especially ponies, are needed for conservation management of these heathlands.  aPublisher supplied data  aED431C 2018/32cXunta de Galicia 3aErica cinerea 3aMolinia caerulea 3aUlex gallii 3aacidity 3acarbon nitrogen ratio 3acation exchange 3acattle 3aclimate 3agraminoids 3aheathlands 3aindicator species 3alandscapes 3aphosphorus 3aplant communities 3ashrubs 3asoil nutrients 3asoil organic matter 3atoxicity 3aIberian Peninsula1 aPontevedra-Pombal, Xabier1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1095-61670 tPlant and soil.g2022 June, v. 475, no. 1-2 p.565-580dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl49373x0032-079X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11104-022-05393-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03047naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094040001800138100002100156245012500177300001800302520160200320592002801922650002101950650001901971650002301990650003102013650001602044650001602060650000902076650001402085650001602099650001302115653001902128653002202147653001602169653002602185653002702211653002002238700002402258700002102282700001702303700002402320700003202344773010202376856009002478852000902568655001202577IND60599702320221120052312.0180702e201406  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059970232DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biomaterials.2014.03.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDavison, Noel L.10aLiposomal clodronate inhibition of osteoclastogenesis and osteoinduction by submicrostructured beta-tricalcium phosphate  ap. 5088-5097.  aBone graft substitutes such as calcium phosphates are subject to the innate inflammatory reaction, which may bear important consequences for bone regeneration. We speculate that the surface architecture of osteoinductive β-tricalcium phosphate (TCP) stimulates the differentiation of invading monocyte/macrophages into osteoclasts, and that these cells may be essential to ectopic bone formation. To test this, porous TCP cubes with either submicron-scale surface architecture known to induce ectopic bone formation (TCPs, positive control) or micron-scale, non-osteoinductive surface architecture (TCPb, negative control) were subcutaneously implanted on the backs of FVB strain mice for 12 weeks. Additional TCPs samples received local, weekly injections of liposome-encapsulated clodronate (TCPs + LipClod) to deplete invading monocyte/macrophages. TCPs induced osteoclast formation, evident by positive tartrate resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) cytochemical staining and negative macrophage membrane marker F4/80 immunostaining. No TRAP positive cells were found in TCPb or TCPs + LipClod, only F4/80 positive macrophages and foreign body giant cells. TCPs stimulated subcutaneous bone formation in all implants, while no bone could be found in TCPb or TCPs + LipClod. In agreement, expression of bone and osteoclast gene markers was upregulated in TCPs versus both TCPb and TCPs + LipClod, which were equivalent. In summary, submicron-scale surface structure of TCP induced osteoclastogenesis and ectopic bone formation in a process that is blocked by monocyte/macrophage depletion.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacid phosphatase 3abone formation 3acalcium phosphates 3agene expression regulation 3agiant cells 3amacrophages 3amice 3amonocytes 3aosteoclasts 3astaining 0aOsteoinduction 0aCalcium phosphate 0aOsteoclasts 0aForeign body response 0aSurface microstructure 0aOsteoimmunology1 aGamblin, Anne-Laure1 aLayrolle, Pierre1 aYuan, Huipin1 ade Bruijn, Joost D.1 aBarrère-de Groot, Florence0 tBiomaterials.g2014 June, v. 35, no. 19 p.5088-5097dElsevier LtdwJournal:11782x0142-96127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biomaterials.2014.03.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02657naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001700144245014300161300001600304500002000320520123300340592002801573650001801601650001601619650001301635650001601648650001401664650001601678650001801694650001601712650001501728650001901743650001401762650001101776650002401787650000901811650001201820650004201832650002601874650001801900650001001918650003001928700001901958773011101977856007802088852000902166655001202175IND60571726620221119162147.0170712e201704  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057172662DNAL7 a10.1002/jobm.2016005572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDuan, Deyong10aDetermination of the microbial community features of Haemaphysalis flava in different developmental stages by high‐throughput sequencing  ap. 302-308.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aIn this study, we analyzed the in vivo microbial community structure and diversity differences of Haemaphysalis flava (H. flava) in four developmental stages (egg, larva, nymph, and adult) to determine which bacterial genera could be propagated through transovarial transmission and transmitted by transstadial transmission during different developmental stages of H. flava. Paired‐end sequencing of the V3 region of the 16S ribosomal DNA (16S rDNA) of H. flava in four developmental stage samples was conducted using the Illumina MiSeq sequencing platform. The following operational taxonomic units (OTUs) of H. flava were obtained during the four developmental stages: 89 of egg, 111 of larva, 104 of nymph, and 106 of female adult tick. Sixty‐four of these OTUs had high similarity in the four developmental stages of H. flava. Eight bacterial genera had the highest abundances in all developmental stages, namely, Rickettsia, Coxiella, Pseudomonas, Ehrlichia, Escherichia, Acinetobacter, Citrobacter, and Cupriavidus. The nymph had the highest abundance of Coxiella, and the female adult tick had the highest abundance of Rickettsia. Staphylococcus and Wolbachia were detected in all developmental stages except the egg.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcinetobacter 3aCitrobacter 3aCoxiella 3aCupriavidus 3aEhrlichia 3aEscherichia 3aHaemaphysalis 3aPseudomonas 3aRickettsia 3aStaphylococcus 3aWolbachia 3aadults 3acommunity structure 3aeggs 3afemales 3ahigh-throughput nucleotide sequencing 3amicrobial communities 3aribosomal DNA 3aticks 3atransovarial transmission1 aCheng, Tianyin0 tJournal of basic microbiology.g2017 Apr., v. 57, no. 4 p.302-308dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx0233-111X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jobm.2016005573Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02471naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245010700167300001800274520139900292592002801691650001201719650001401731650001801745650001501763650001101778700001701789700001901806700001901825700001601844700001701860700001901877700001901896773009901915856008602014852000902100655001202109IND60577669120171221000000.0170810e20170613xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057766912DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.langmuir.7b011402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHan, Yandong10aUnraveling the Growth Mechanism of Silica Particles in the Stöber Method: In Situ Seeded Growth Model  ap. 5879-5890.  aIn this work, we investigated the kinetic balance between ammonia-catalyzed hydrolysis of tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS) and subsequent condensation over the growth of silica particles in the Stöber method. Our results reveal that, at the initial stage, the reaction is dictated by TEOS hydrolysis to form silanol monomers, which is denoted as pathway I and is responsible for nucleation and growth of small silica particles via condensation of neighboring silanol monomers and siloxane network clusters derived thereafter. Afterward, the reaction is dictated by condensation of newly formed silanol monomers onto the earlier formed silica particles, which is denoted as pathway II and is responsible for the enlargement in size of silica particles. When TEOS hydrolysis is significantly promoted, either at high ammonia concentration (≥0.95 M) or at low ammonia concentration in the presence of LiOH as secondary catalyst, temporal separation of pathways I and II makes the Stöber method reminiscent of in situ seeded growth. This knowledge advance enables us not only to reconcile the most prevailing aggregation-only and monomer-addition models in literature into one consistent framework to interpret the Stöber process but also to grow monodisperse silica particles with sizes in the range 15–230 nm simply but precisely regulated by the ammonia concentration with the aid of LiOH.  aPublisher supplied data 3aammonia 3acatalysts 3agrowth models 3ahydrolysis 3asilica1 aLü, Ziyang,1 aTeng, Zhaogang1 aLiang, Jinglun1 aGuo, Zilong1 aWang, Dayang1 aHan, Ming-Yong1 aYang, Wensheng0 tLangmuir.g2017 June 13, v. 33, no. 23 p.5879-5890dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.langmuir.7b011403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01396naa a2200265 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002400075024004200099040001800141100000700159245004000166300001400206520057200220592002800792650001800820650001400838650001500852650002800867773010200895852000900997856008901006990002301095655001201118991633498140742620221118162539.0181029e197601  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aCAIN7794408162DNAL7 a10.1097/00017285-197601000-000062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 a, 10aLeslie and Betty and the Hobgoblins  ap. 16-17.  aExtract: Recently, CBS and NBC produced television shows that were supposed to give the public a better understanding of the food we eat.

Direct and Correlated Responses among Secondary Traits  ap. 1315-1324.  aepub  aRecurrent selection for drought tolerance for three to eight cycles has increased grain yield (GY) under drought at flowering by 30 to 50% in three lowland tropical maize (Zea mays L.) populations. The relationships among secondary traits as a result of this selection have not been determined, however. The objectives of this study were to measure direct and correlated changes due to selection in secondary traits by evaluating cycles of selection and appropriate check entries at five water-stressed (mean yield 2.35, range 1.01–4.48 Mg ha⁻¹) and five well-watered environments (mean yield 7.96, range 5.81–10.40 Mg ha⁻¹). Under drought, changes per cycle with recurrent S₁ selection (P < 0.05) were as follows: GY 12.6%, fertile ears per plant (EPP) 8.9%, grains per fertile ear (GPE) 6.3%, grain number per square meter 12.2%, 1000 grain weight no change, anthesis-silking interval (ASI) −22.0%, days from sowing to 50% anthesis −0.7%, plant height −2.0%, primary tassel branch number −5.9%, and senesced leaf area 2.7%. Responses under well-watered conditions were smaller but generally of the same sign. Grain yield was strongly associated with grain number per square meter in both water-stressed and well-watered environments (r = 0. 96; r = 0.87; P < 0.001) Grain yield, EPP, and GPE were strongly correlated with ASI across entries under drought (r = −0.89, −0.93, −0.90; P < 0.001), though not when water was plentiful. The use of managed stress environments that consistently reveal genetic variation for these traits at specific times during crop development is endorsed for selection purposes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aZea mays 3acorn 3acorrelated responses 3adrought 3adrought tolerance 3aflowering 3agenetic variation 3agrain yield 3ainflorescences 3aleaf area 3aplant height 3arecurrent selection 3asowing 3awater stress1 aEdmeades, G.O.0 tCrop science.g1999 Sept., v. 39, no. 5 p.1315-1324dCrop Science Society of AmericawJournal:jnl44570x0011-183X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2135/cropsci1999.3951315x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02919naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245013100166300001800297520137000315592002801685650002101713650002501734650001401759650001801773650002901791650001901820650001501839650002801854650002101882650001601903650001101919650001001930650001701940650001601957650002201973650002401995650001302019650001502032700001902047700001902066700001902085700002002104700001602124700001802140700002002158700001802178773010302196856008102299852000902380655001202389IND60086495620221120103355.0141101e201211  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008649562DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fct.2012.08.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, Yŏn-suk,10aIn vitro protective effects of Thymus quinquecostatus Celak extracts on t-BHP-induced cell damage through antioxidant activity  ap. 4191-4198.  aThe purpose of this study was to evaluate the antioxidative activities of water and 70% ethanolic extracts from the Thymus quinquecostatus Celak (TQC) for natural antioxidant source. The antioxidant activities were compared with other natural and synthetic antioxidants. The levels of total polyphenols and flavonoids were also determined. The extracts were found to have different levels of antioxidant properties in a few kind of assay. The results showed that higher radical scavenging activity, reducing power and antioxidant capacity in FRAP than those of BHT as a positive control. In addition, the extracts from the TQC leaf and stem showed stronger antioxidant activity than that of vitamin C, α-tocopherol in ferric thiocyanate (FTC) and thiobarbituric acid (TBA) methods. Cytoprotective and anti-apoptotic effect of water extracts from TQC was also prevented t-BHP-induced toxicity in Chang liver cells. Therefore, these results indicate that TQC extracts have antioxidant properties through its ability to enhance the cell viability, reduction of production of ROS, inhibition of oxidative damage, mitochondria dysfunction and ultimately inhibition of cell apoptosis. Based on the results described above, it is suggested that TQC has the potential to protect liver on t-BHP-induced cell damage and should be considered as a prospective functional food.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalpha-tocopherol 3aantioxidant activity 3aapoptosis 3aascorbic acid 3abutylated hydroxytoluene 3acell viability 3aflavonoids 3afree radical scavengers 3afunctional foods 3ahepatocytes 3aleaves 3aliver 3amitochondria 3apolyphenols 3aprotective effect 3athiobarbituric acid 3atoxicity 3atoxicology1 aLee, Seung-Jae1 aHwang, Jin-Woo1 aKim, Eun-Kyung1 aKim, Sŏng-ŭn,1 aKim, Ee-Hwa1 aMoon, Sang-Ho1 aJeon, Byung-Tae1 aPark, Pyo-Jam0 tFood and chemical toxicology.g2012 Nov., v. 50, no. 11 p.4191-4198dElsevier Ltdx0278-69157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fct.2012.08.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03199naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094024002200132024001900154040001800173100002100191245009000212300001600302506007600318520124700394592002801641506003701669650001601706650000901722650001901731650000901750650001001759650001701769650001801786650002001804650001101824650001901835650004301854650001501897650001801912650002101930650003001951650001801981650000901999650001102008650002002019653002902039653003202068653004202100653003502142653003502177700002302212700002402235700002302259700001502282700002502297700006002322773009702382856008502479852000902564655001202573IND60590703720221207114139.0190131e20180315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059070372DNAL7 a10.1016/j.watres.2017.12.0232doi7 aPMC59995312pmcid7 a292787892pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJiang, Yu Sherry10aPortable platform for rapid in-field identification of human fecal pollution in water  ap. 186-195.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aHuman fecal contamination of water is a public health risk. However, inadequate testing solutions frustrate timely, actionable monitoring. Bacterial culture-based methods are simple but typically cannot distinguish fecal host source. PCR assays can identify host sources but require expertise and infrastructure. To bridge this gap we have developed a field-ready nucleic acid diagnostic platform and rapid sample preparation methods that enable on-site identification of human fecal contamination within 80 min of sampling. Our platform relies on loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) of human-associated Bacteroides HF183 genetic markers from crude samples. Oligonucleotide strand exchange (OSD) probes reduce false positives by sequence specifically transducing LAMP amplicons into visible fluorescence that can be photographed by unmodified smartphones. Our assay can detect as few as 17 copies/ml of human-associated HF183 targets in sewage-contaminated water without cross-reaction with canine or feline feces. It performs robustly with a variety of environmental water sources and with raw sewage. We have also developed lyophilized assays and inexpensive 3D-printed devices to minimize cost and facilitate field application.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aBacteroides 3acats 3across reaction 3adogs 3afeces 3afluorescence 3afreeze drying 3agenetic markers 3ahumans 3ainfrastructure 3aloop-mediated isothermal amplification 3amonitoring 3anucleic acids 3aoligonucleotides 3apolymerase chain reaction 3apublic health 3arisk 3asewage 3awater pollution 0aFecal indicator bacteria 0aFecal source identification 0aIsothermal nucleic acid amplification 0aPortable molecular diagnostics 0aDNA strand displacement probes1 aRiedel, Timothy E.1 aPopoola, Jessica A.1 aMorrow, Barrett R.1 aCai, Sheng1 aEllington, Andrew D.1 aBhadra, Sanchita1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4956-24050 tWater research.g2018 Mar. 15, v. 131 p.186-195dElsevier LtdwJournal:1966x0043-13547nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2017.12.0233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03858naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094040001800138100001600156245009100172300001800263520230500281592002802586650002502614650001802639650001802657650002302675650001302698650002102711650002002732650001102752650001202763650002602775650001702801650001302818650001302831650002302844650001802867650001202885650001402897653001802911653001502929653002102944653003302965700001202998700001303010700001103023700002003034700001503054700001603069700001803085773010203103856009003205852000903295655001203304IND60599702520221120052408.0180702e201406  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059970252DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biomaterials.2014.03.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJiao, Liang10aCryopreserved dentin matrix as a scaffold material for dentin-pulp tissue regeneration  ap. 4929-4939.  aCryopreservation has been identified as an efficient approach to preserve tissue engineered products for a long term. Our prior studies have suggested that the treated dentin matrix (TDM) could be an ideal bioactive scaffold for dental tissue regeneration. In this study, we hypothesize that the cryopreservation could effectively maintain the survival and viability of dentinogenesis-related proteins of TDM and the cryopreserved dentin matrix (CDM) would provide the suitable biological scaffold and inductive microenvironment for the regeneration of dentin-pulp like tissue. CDM-3 and CDM-6 were prepared by cryopreserving TDM in liquid nitrogen (−196 °C) with cryoprotectant for 3 months and 6 months, respectively. Various biological characteristics of CDM, including mechanical properties, cell proliferation, and odontogenesis ability, were investigated. To further evaluate the inductive capacity of CDM, human dental follicle cells were encapsulated within CDM, and implanted the scaffold into a mouse model for 8 weeks, and the grafts were harvested and assessed histologically. The CDM showed superior mechanical properties than TDM. Compared to TDM, CDM can release more dentinogenesis-related proteins due to the larger pore diameter. Cell proliferation with the addition of CDM extract liquid was similar to that of TDM in the first five days. Human dental follicle cells, under the effect of CDM extract liquid, highly expressed bone sialoprotein, collagen-1, alkaline phosphatase, indicating that CDM, regarded as the inductive microenvironment, plays an important role in odontogenesis. Most importantly, in vivo, CDM could induce dental follicle cells to regenerate new dentin-pulp like tissues, such as dentinal tubules, predentin, collagen fibers, nerves, and blood vessels which were positive for dentin sialophosphoprotein, dental matrix protein-1, Tubulin, and collagen-1. In conclusion, CDM is an ideal biological scaffold material for human dentin-pulp like tissue regeneration. These findings indicated that TDM could be preserved as the tissue engineering scaffold that is readily available for patient treatments. Furthermore, the success of cryopreservation of TDM may also provide an insight into preserving other bioactive scaffold materials of tissue engineering.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalkaline phosphatase 3aanimal models 3ablood vessels 3acell proliferation 3acollagen 3acryopreservation 3acryoprotectants 3ahumans 3aliquids 3amechanical properties 3anerve tissue 3anitrogen 3apatients 3atissue engineering 3atissue repair 3atubulin 3aviability 0aDentin matrix 0aStem cells 0aCryopreservation 0aBioactive scaffold materials1 aXie, Li1 aYang, Bo1 aYumei,1 aJiang, Zongting1 aFeng, Lian1 aGuo, Weihua1 aTian, Weidong0 tBiomaterials.g2014 June, v. 35, no. 18 p.4929-4939dElsevier LtdwJournal:11782x0142-96127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biomaterials.2014.03.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02436naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005100094040001800145100002000163245007300183300001600256500000900272520129800281592002801579650001601607650001901623650001401642650001601656650001101672650002001683650001401703650002101717650001301738650001801751700001801769700001701787700001801804773012101822856009801943852000902041655001202050IND60665548220221120141640.0191122e197711  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066554822DNAL7 a10.2135/cropsci1977.0011183X001700060028x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBhagsari, A.

Merr.] cultivars, four each in maturity groups V through VIII. Data were obtained on 12 to 16-day-old terminal leaflets attached to plants grown in a greenhouse. In three separate sets of measurements AP rates of the 16 cultivars ranged from 23 to 37 mg CO₂ dm⁻² hour⁻¹ and differences among cultivars were found in each of the three measurements. Significant differences among cultivars were also observed in Pr, T, and SLW. Mesophyll diffusion resistance (rₘ) calculated from AP and T data also differed among cultivars. Pr not only increased as AP increased but also accounted for a higher percentage of photosynthesis in cultivars with higher Pr. AP rate was positively correlated with T and negatively correlated with laminar plus stomatal (rₐ+rₐ) diffusion resistance and with r. The correlation of AP with SLW was significant in only one of three measurements. The determinate cultivars examined in this study display for most physiological parameters a similar range in cultivar performance as published reports for indeterminate cultivars.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGlycine max 3acarbon dioxide 3acultivars 3agreenhouses 3aleaves 3amaturity groups 3amesophyll 3aphotorespiration 3asoybeans 3atranspiration1 aAshley, D.

To study the retrotransposon-based polymorphisms, 18 primers based on the LTR sequences of Tvv1, Gret1 and Vine-1 were used. In the analysis of 41 cultivars, 517 IRAP, REMAP, AFLP and SSAP fragments were obtained, 83% of which were polymorphic. For IRAP, only the Tvv1Fa primer amplified DNA fragments. In the REMAP analysis, the Tvv1Fa-Ms14 primer combination only produced polymorphic bands, and the Vine-1 primers produced mainly ISSR fragments. The highest number of polymorphic fragments was found for AFLP. Both AFLP and SSAP showed a greater capacity for identifying clones, resulting in 15 and 9 clones identified, respectively. Together, all of the techniques allowed for the identification of 54% of the studied clones, which is an important step in solving one of the challenges that viticulture currently faces.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aVitis vinifera 3aamplified fragment length polymorphism 3aclones 3agermplasm 3amicrosatellite repeats 3aretrotransposons 3aviticulture 3awine cultivars 3awine grapes 2aAmplified Fragment Length Polymorphism Analysisxmethods 2aClone Cells 2aCluster Analysis 2aEcotype 2aElectrophoresis, Agar Gel 2aGenetic Markers 2aPhylogeny 2aPolymorphism, Genetic 2aRetroelementsxgenetics 2aVitisxgenetics 3aPortugal 0aPortugal1 aD’Onofrio, Claudio1 aMartín, Juan Pedro1 aOrtiz, Jesús María1 aDe Lorenzis, Gabriella1 aFerreira, Vanessa1 aPinto-Carnide, Olinda0 tMolecular biotechnology.g2012 Sept., v. 52, no. 1 p.26-39dSpringer-Verlagx1073-60857nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12033-011-9470-y  aDNAL 7aarticle02834naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245019800168300001600366520127400382592002801656650001601684650002001700650001301720650001901733650004301752650001601795650001501811650002601826650001301852650001801865650002901883650001701912653001501929653002001944653001501964653001701979653002201996653002202018700002002040700001702060700001802077700002502095773013802120856008502258852000902343655001202352IND60517296420221118152545.0160329e20160315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051729642DNAL7 a10.1080/03067319.2016.11603812doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMann, Oliver10aDevelopment and validation of a fully automated online-SPE–ESI–LC–MS/MS multi-residue method for the determination of different classes of pesticides in drinking, ground and surface water  ap. 353-372.  aThe present work describes a fully automated method based on online solid phase extraction–liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry for the determination of different classes of pesticides, including acidic and polar pesticides and six thiamethoxam metabolites. Sample preconcentration was performed by extracting 4 mL of the sample with a single styrene-divinylbenzene polymer. Elution of the compounds was done within the high performance liquid chromatography gradient and tandem mass spectrometry determination was performed in the selected reaction monitoring mode, by recording 1–3 transitions per compound. The overall pretreatment and analysis time per sample was less than 15 min. Method validation was performed in drinking, ground and surface water. For nearly all compounds a recovery between 70% and 120% could be achieved. The limit of detection ranges from 1.2 to 18 ng/L in drinking water and 3.0 to 23 ng/L in ground and surface water. The correlation coefficients for a calibration range of 0.05–2 µg/L are between 0.9915 and 0.9999. The limit of quantification (LOQ) for all compounds lies below the required limit of 0.1 µg/L, to fulfil the Council Directive 98/83/EC. Most of the compounds easily reach an LOQ below 0.05 µg/L.  aPublisher supplied data 3acorrelation 3adetection limit 3adrinking 3adrinking water 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3ametabolites 3amonitoring 3amultiresidue analysis 3apolymers 3asurface water 3atandem mass spectrometry 3athiamethoxam 0apesticides 0awater pollution 0aclopyralid 0athiamethoxam 0apolar metabolites 0aacidic pesticides1 aPock, Elisabeth1 aWruss, Klaus1 aWruss, Werner1 aKrska, R.q(Rudolf),0 tInternational journal of environmental analytical chemistry.g2016 Mar. 15, v. 96, no. 4 p.353-372dTaylor & Francisx1029-03977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03067319.2016.11603813Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03440naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002200139245011900161300001600280500002000296520183200316592002802148596008202176650001402258650001002272650001302282650002102295650002002316650000902336650001302345650001902358650002802377650001302405650001802418650002802436650002302464650001702487650002702504650002002531650001002551650002302561650001602584650001202600650001402612700002002626700006202646773013202708856007302840852000902913655001202922IND60684017620221118122603.0200216e202002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068401762DNAL7 a10.1111/rda.135992doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVarela, Elizabeth10aMembrane stability and mitochondrial activity of bovine sperm frozen with low‐density lipoproteins and trehalose  ap. 146-153.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aCryopreservation results in the destabilization of the sperm plasma membrane, leading to negative side effects such as premature cryocapacitation, apoptosis and the low mitochondrial activity of bovine spermatozoa. Low‐density lipoproteins (LDL) and trehalose have been used in seminal freezing to protect the integrity and stability of sperm membranes. Likewise, trehalose can increase the mitochondrial activity of sperm. The objective of this study was to evaluate the membrane stability and mitochondrial activity of bovine sperm after being frozen and treated with LDL sources and trehalose. Ten ejaculates from five bulls were cryopreserved under the treatments, CEY: chicken egg yolk (20% v/v); CCEY: centrifuged CEY (20% v/v); LDL: LDL (8% v/v); T: trehalose (100 mM); and TLDL: T (100 mM) plus LDL (8% v/v). After thawing, membrane stability and mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨM) were assessed by flow cytometry through the M‐540/Yopro‐1 and DiOC6/PI probes. The structural membrane integrity (SMI) was evaluated by fluorescence microscopy using SYBR14/PI dyes. A generalized linear model was adjusted, and the means were compared using the Tukey test. Centrifuged chicken egg yolk and LDL had a higher proportion of non‐cryocapacitated non‐apoptotic sperm (M−Y−), while CEY and T had the largest populations of cryocapacitated non‐apoptotic sperm (M+Y−) and cryocapacitated apoptotic sperm (M+Y+). Centrifuged chicken egg yolk also showed a higher proportion of sperm with high‐ΔΨM. Treatments that included egg yolk or purified LDL had a positive effect on SMI. Centrifuged chicken egg yolk has a superior cryoprotective effect on membrane stability and mitochondrial activity of bovine semen over the conventional use of CEY or the individual or simultaneous use of LDL and trehalose.  aPublisher supplied data  cNational University of Colombia and Colombian Polytechnic Jaime Isaza Cadavid 3aapoptosis 3abulls 3achickens 3acryopreservation 3acryoprotectants 3adyes 3aegg yolk 3aflow cytometry 3afluorescence microscopy 3afreezing 3alinear models 3alow density lipoprotein 3amembrane potential 3amitochondria 3amitochondrial membrane 3aplasma membrane 3asemen 3asperm capacitation 3aspermatozoa 3athawing 3atrehalose1 aRojas, Mauricio1 aRestrepo, Giovanni1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8427-44330 tReproduction in domestic animals.g2020 Feb., v. 55, no. 2 p.146-153dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl44391x0936-67687nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/rda.135993Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02759naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005700094040001800151100001900169245009100188300001600279520154400295592002801839650002001867650001001887650001501897650002201912650002301934650001901957650001801976650002201994651001902016653002502035653002502060653001902085653002102104700001702125773011902142856010302261852000902364655001202373IND50065149120221123005351.0151127e200502  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006514912DNAL7 a10.1658/1100-9233(2005)016[0121:TROTSB]2.0.CO;22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPakeman, R. J.14aThe role of the seed bank, seed rain and the timing of disturbance in gap regeneration  ap. 121-130.  aQuestion: Does the degree and timing of disturbance contribute significantly to the pattern and process of regeneration in plant communities as a consequence of the availability and number of species of propagules present?Location: Acid grassland at 230 m a.s.l., eastern Scotland, UK.Methods: Plots were surface disturbed or had their soil profile inverted at monthly intervals at 12 dates during a year. Seed bank and seed rain were assessed at each treatment time. The effect of disturbance intensity and timing on the regenerating vegetation was assessed.Results: Removing the seed bank significantly slowed regeneration, as it contributed 43 %% of developing cover after one year where it was present.At an individual seed level, seed in the seed rain had a much higher likelihood of contributing to the regenerating vegetation than a seed in the seed bank. Some species showed a reliance on the seed bank for regeneration, and hence there was a significant difference in the vegetation that developed between plots with the seed bank intact and those where it was removed. Winter disturbed plots (little seed rain) had slower rates of re-vegetation than summer disturbed plots. Timing had little effect on species composition, though a significantly higher cover of perennial forb species developed on the winter disturbed plots.Conclusion: Removing the contribution of the seed bank had a greater effect on the composition of regenerating vegetation than the effect of seasonal variation on the seed rain.Nomenclature: Stace (1997).  aPublisher supplied data 3adisturbed soils 3aforbs 3agrasslands 3aplant communities 3aseasonal variation 3aseed dispersal 3asoil profiles 3aspecies diversity 3aUnited Kingdom 0aSeasonal disturbance 0aSecondary succession 0aSeed dispersal 0aSpecies richness1 aSmall, J.

At least some of this increase is due to the natural conversion of abandoned agricultural lands into forests. However, little is known about how these new stands develop on abandoned agricultural lands in comparison with natural regeneration of existing forests. Specifically, knowledge of how black pine (Pinus nigra Arnold) naturally establishes and develops on abandoned agricultural lands is limited. In this study, we examined the density and growth of black pine saplings as well as some morphological and anatomical characteristics on an abandoned agricultural land (AAS). These data were compared with those observed in a naturally regenerated stand (NRS), and in a forest opening (FOS). The greatest sapling density was observed in the NRS site, while sapling growth and stem biomass were higher in AAS followed by NRS and FOS. Moreover, each study site exhibited site-specific morphological and anatomical traits in their saplings. Our findings showed that site treatments and overstory openness would both play crucial role for establishment and development of black pine.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPinus nigra 3aabandoned land 3aacreage 3abiomass 3aforests 3anatural regeneration 3aoverstory 3asapling growth1 aKeleş, Seray Özden1 aLoewenstein, Edward F.0 tEnvironmental monitoring and assessment.g2021 Sept., v. 193, no. 9 p.621-621dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl33242x0167-63697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-021-09403-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02937naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001400151245014000165300001600305520131300321592002801634650001201662650001101674650002601685650002001711650001701731650001601748650001601764650001201780650001501792650001201807650001901819650000901838650002401847650001701871650001801888650001201906650001901918650001701937650001001954651001701964653002801981653002002009653002702029653003202056653002202088700001502110700001302125700001702138773013402155856008502289852000902374655001202383IND60705989120221122183829.0200807e20200314xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070598912DNAL7 a10.1080/02571862.2019.16987772doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMotema, T10aResponse of soil organic matter indices and fractions after 37 years of wheat production management practices in semi-arid South Africa  ap. 136-143.  aThe current study evaluated the long-term response of soil organic matter (SOM) indices and fractions on wheat production management practices in the semi-arid region of South Africa. The treatments included three tillage methods (no-tillage, stubble mulch and ploughing), two residue disposal methods (no-burning and burning), and two weed control methods (chemical and mechanical). The soil samples were collected at 0–50, 50–100, 100–150, 150–250, 250–350 and 350–450 mm depth intervals to quantify total carbon (C), total nitrogen (N), C:N ratio, fulvic acid (CFA) humic acid, (CHA) and CHA:CFA ratio. Tillage methods significantly increased total C, CFA and CHA in the majority of the soil layers as compared to total N and C:N ratio. Residue disposal methods had few significant differences in total C, total N and C:N ratio. Weeding methods and treatment interactions had no significant difference in SOM indices and fractions. The results suggest that SOM of this semi-arid region, could be improved by tillage practices that encourage accumulation of crop residues rather than using mouldboard ploughing. Even though the grain yield was not affected by management practices, if the aim is towards the sustainable use of soil, soil quality should be prioritized more than the grain yield.  aPublisher supplied data 3aburning 3acarbon 3acarbon nitrogen ratio 3acontrol methods 3afulvic acids 3agrain yield 3ahumic acids 3amulches 3ano-tillage 3aplowing 3asemiarid zones 3asoil 3asoil organic matter 3asoil quality 3asoil sampling 3astubble 3atotal nitrogen 3aweed control 3awheat 3aSouth Africa 0acrop residue management 0ahumic fractions 0asandy loam Plinthosols 0asoil organic matter indices 0atillage practices1 aKotze, E.,1 aLoke, PF1 adu Preez, CC0 tSouth African journal of plant and soil =.g2020 Mar. 14, v. 37, no. 2 p.136-143dTaylor & FranciswJournal:2010x2167-034X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02571862.2019.16987773Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02257naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002000146245008400166300002000250500001900270520124100289592002801530650001101558650001501569650001901584650001601603700001501619700005901634773017301693856008001866852000901946655001201955IND60715531320221122230130.0201028e20201015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071553132DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.iecr.0c034492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNair, Mahesh M.10aDopant-Induced Tailoring of Isothermal Redox Properties of CaMnO₃ Perovskites  ap. 19406-19414.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aIn the present manuscript, we address the effects of B-site substitution (Fe and Co) on the redox performance of CaMnO₃, under the conditions of chemical looping combustion (CLC). The variations in composition and redox chemistry were found to be influenced by both the nature and the amount of the B-site components and the temperature of operation. The low-temperature (600 °C) performance was found to be enhanced by replacing Mn with 5% of Fe or Co, independently. At 750 °C, all of the materials were found to exhibit performance loss during the first few cycles. Even though these materials exhibited stable reduction and re-oxidation extents afterward, complete destruction of the perovskite structure was observed after 15 cycles. At 900 °C, the long-term redox performance variations were found to not depend on the presence of impurity phases and surface structure, indicating that the oxidation state of the cations and temperature were playing a more decisive role in determining the redox chemistry of these materials. All of the materials used in this study were found to selectively suppress the undesirable CH₄ splitting reaction and the resultant carbon deposition, which may be attributed to the basicity of Ca.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3acombustion 3aprocess design 3atemperature1 aYu, Ningyu1 aMahinpey, Nader1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8477-72280 tIndustrial & engineering chemistry process design and development.g2020 Oct. 15, v. 59, no. 43 p.19406-19414dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23342x1520-50457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.iecr.0c034493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02748naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002400144245010300168300001800271520131300289592002801602650002201630650001401652650001701666650001601683650001101699650002401710650002201734650001401756650001701770650001701787650003301804650001601837653001201853653001601865653002201881653000801903700001901911700001801930700001601948700001701964700002401981700002802005773014502033856007902178852000902257655001202266IND60767499920221118032215.0220218e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076749992DNAL7 a10.37992/2021.1204.1522doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBarik, Satyaprakash10aGenetic variability, character association and diversity studies in brinjal (Solanum melongena L.)  ap. 1102-1110.  aAn experiment was conducted to assess the existing variability in brinjal germplasm based on Mahalanobis's D² statistic based on nine quantitative traits. The germplasm accessions were classifed into six clusters, in which the highest inter-cluster distance was recorded between clusters III and IV. Cluster I exhibited a low mean estimate for days to 50% fowering; cluster VI showed high estimates of the mean for plant height, the number of primary branches per plant, average fruit weight, and 1000 seed weight. Cluster V recorded the highest number of fruits and fruit yields per plant. Principal component analysis revealed total variability of 53.09 per cent, contributed by PC 1 (30.83%) and PC 2 (23.07%). Traits viz., days to 50% fowering, plant height, an average number of branches per plant, fruit length, and 1000 seed weight contributed positive signifcant component loadings for the frst two PCs. High heritability and high GAM were also recorded for a number of fruits per plant, fruit yield per plant, fruit length, fruit girth, fruit weight, and 1000 seed weight. Fruit yield and the number of fruits per plant were positively and signifcantly associated with each other. Hence, simultaneous selection of these traits is advised for the genetic improvement in the brinjal breeding program.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSolanum melongena 3aeggplants 3afruit weight 3afruit yield 3afruits 3agenetic improvement 3agenetic variation 3agermplasm 3aheritability 3aplant height 3aprincipal component analysis 3aseed weight 0aBrinjal 0aCorrelation 0aGenetic diversity 0aPCA1 aPonnam, Naresh1 aAcharya, G.C.1 aSingh, T.H.1 aDash, Manasi1 aSahu, Gouri Shankar1 aMahapatra, Subrat Kumar0 tElectronic journal of plant breeding.g2021 Dec., v. 12, no. 4 p.1102-1110dIndian Society of Plant BreederswJournal:27365x0975-928X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.37992/2021.1204.1523Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01412naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100002900138245013200167300001800299520034200317592002800659650001200687650002200699650001400721650001500735650001400750700002000764700002200784700001800806700001800824700002100842773012900863856007300992852000901065655001201074IND60658028320221122210906.0190816e20061018xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065802832DNAL7 a10.1039/b610171b2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSandanayaka, Atula S.

In this study, we investigated an evaluation method of the overall performance of an exhaust gas purification system in a heavy-duty vehicle that complies with Japan’s latest emission regulations through activity tests of single and combined catalysts in a laboratory under simulated reaction gas conditions. The degradation rate of a simulated aged sample relative to a fresh sample was evaluated for a single selective catalytic reduction (SCR) catalyst and an SCR catalyst combined with a diesel oxidation catalyst and an ammonia slip catalyst. The results showed that the degradation of the SCR catalyst had a significant impact on the overall NOx purification performance of the system. The results and the evaluation method provide a useful reference for the improvement in the exhaust gas purification technology used in diesel vehicle engines.  aPublisher supplied data 3aJapan 3aammonia 3acatalysts 3aoxidation 3aprocess design1 aObuchi, Akira1 aYamamoto, Asuka1 aSuzuki, Shunsuke1 aMizushima, Norifumi0 tIndustrial & engineering chemistry process design and development.g2020 Oct. 13, v. 59, no. 43 p.19185-19193dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23342x1520-50457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.iecr.0c035133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02573naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092024002200127024001900149040001800168100001800186245011900204300001600323506007600339520115600415592002801571506003701599650002601636650003001662650001201692650001201704650001301716650002001729650001301749650001701762651001201779700002501791700001301816700002201829700001901851700001501870700002201885700002001907773009801927856008102025852000902106655001202115IND4408519020221207082856.0151024e200809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440851902DNAL7 a10.1007/s00436-008-1038-92doi7 aPMC25832342pmcid7 a185238012pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSarr, Ousmane10aMutations in PFCRT K76T do not correlate with sulfadoxine–pyrimethamine–amodiaquine failure in Pikine, Senegal  ap. 765-769.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aIn 2003, the high level of chloroquine (CQ) treatment failure for uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria cases has led Senegal to adopt a new combination therapy with sulfadoxine–pyrimethamine and amodiaquine (SP-AQ). From September through November 2004, we used the 14-day World Health Organization follow-up protocol to assess the therapeutic response in patients with uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria in an area of high prevalence of pfcrt T76 mutant allele and SP resistance mutations. Of the 82 patients who were recruited, 68 (82.9%) completed follow-up. The response of the patients to treatment was adequate clinical response for 63 out of 68 patients (92.6%), while five (7.4%) clinical failures were recorded, four early treatment failures, and one late treatment failure. The prevalence of the pfcrt T76 allele at day 0 was 59.5%. The two-sided Fisher’s exact test did not show an association between pfcrt T76 allele and treatment failure (p = 0.167). The transitory treatment is effective and safe. However, the presence of high levels of mutant alleles points out the need to closely monitor the new therapeutic regimen.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aPlasmodium falciparum 3aWorld Health Organization 3aalleles 3amalaria 3amutation 3anew combination 3apatients 3atherapeutics 3aSenegal1 aAhouidi, Ambroise D.1 aLy, Omar1 aDaily, Johanna P.1 aNdiaye, Daouda1 aNdir, Omar1 aMboup, Souleymane1 aWirth, Dyann F.0 tParasitology research.g2008 Sept., v. 103, no. 4 p.765-769dSpringer-Verlagx0932-01137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00436-008-1038-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02921naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100006200139245016200201300001600363500002000379520161400399592002802013596007802041650001302119650001202132650002302144650001102167650001402178650001802192650001702210650002102227650001002248650001102258650002202269651001002291700002402301773011602325856007302441852000902514655001202523IND60661137820221119083556.0190828e201909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066113782DNAL7 a10.1111/aec.127622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOrellana, José I.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4011-958910aPutative local adaptations modulate the interactions of the carnivorous plant Drosera uniflora Willd (1809) (Droseraceae) with cushion and shrub nurse plants  ap. 962-972.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aCushion and shrub plants are typical high mountain nurse plants. In Magellanic tundras of the Cordillera del Sarao on the coast of Chile, the carnivorous plant Drosera uniflora grows in association with cushions of Donatia fascicularis and the shrubs Chusquea montana var. nigricans and Lepidothamnus fonkii. The different microhabitats for recruitment, in addition to the limited gene flow of D. uniflora, enable us to hypothesise that this plant manifests putative local adaptations, expressed in seed germination and population abundance. Our aim was to evaluate the local adaptation of D. uniflora to cushion and shrub microhabitats by estimating germination and abundance. Local adaptation of seed germination was determined by means of reciprocal transplant experiments. Abundance was determined in small plots located inside, on the edge and outside the nurse plants. Seed origin and growth substrate play a decisive role in D. uniflora germination. Seeds that originate from cushions plant habitat and germinate in the same substrate do so in greater numbers than when those which originate from shrubby habitats. Conversely, seeds that originate from shrubby habitat and germinate in the same substrate do not exhibit significant differences. Abundance was always greater inside than outside of the nurse plants. We concluded that availability and quality of different microhabitats for seed germination and recruitment, together with a limited gene flow, would trigger putative local adaptations in D. uniflora, modulating a long history of interactions with the plants that act as nurse plants.  aPublisher supplied data  aProyect FNI 06/16cDirección de Investigación, Universidad de Los Lagos 3aChusquea 3aDrosera 3acarnivorous plants 3acoasts 3agene flow 3amicrohabitats 3anurse plants 3aseed germination 3aseeds 3ashrubs 3aspecies abundance 3aChile1 aValdivia, Carlos E.0 tAustral ecology.g2019 Sept., v. 44, no. 6 p.962-972dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl59958x1442-99857nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/aec.127623Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02937naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245008600168300001800254520138300272592002801655596005901683650001901742650004401761650001401805650002101819650001501840650001801855650001501873650001201888650001701900650002201917650001801939650001501957650001101972650001401983650003301997650002102030650001502051650002102066650002502087700001802112700001302130700001402143700001702157773016602174856008202340852000902422655001202431IND60637030320221118060142.0190413e201903  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063703032DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-019-04392-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Tingting10aRegeneration of 4-chlorophenol from spent powdered activated carbon by ultrasound  ap. 9161-9173.  aUltrasound-assisted regeneration of powdered activated carbon (PAC) saturated with 4-chlorophenol (4-CP) was investigated in this work. The variables, i.e., acoustic frequency, density levels, regenerating solution species, spent PAC mass, and the number of repeated cycle, were optimized. The UV–Vis spectra, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET), and pore structure analysis were used to characterize the regenerated PAC as compared to the virgin and spent PAC. The adsorption experiments indicated that the adsorption kinetics of 4-CP fitted well with the pseudo-second-order model, and the main chemisorption process was nonlinear and heterogeneous. The desorption results showed that the optimized regenerated conditions were identified as 40 kHz of frequency, 0.18 W/mL of sonication intensity, 0.1 M NaOH and 50% (v/v) ethyl alcohol mixture of regeneration solution, and 1 g/L of saturated PAC mass. Under this condition, the regeneration efficiency reached up to 86.81%. Hydroxylated oxidation products especially benzoquinone and hydroquinone were formed during ultrasound regeneration. Ultrasound mainly acted on surface functionalities, mesopores, and macropores of PAC through the hydroxyl radical oxidization resulted from the cavitation effect.  aPublisher supplied data  a51778012cNational Natural Science Foundation of China 3a4-chlorophenol 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aacoustics 3aactivated carbon 3aadsorption 3abenzoquinones 3adesorption 3aethanol 3ahydroquinone 3ahydroxyl radicals 3ahydroxylation 3amacropores 3amodels 3aoxidation 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asodium hydroxide 3asonication 3athermogravimetry 3aultrasonic treatment1 aYang, Yanling1 aLi, Xing1 aWang, Nan1 aZhou, Zhiwei0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research international.g2019 Mar., v. 26, no. 9 p.9161-9173dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-019-04392-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02421naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092040001800125100001700143245008900160300001400249520133900263592002801602650001101630650001601641650001701657650002001674650002401694650001601718650001101734650001201745650001901757650001901776650003901795650001601834700001801850700002401868773008801892856004601980852000902026655001202035IND4477816120221120114955.0120727e200010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447781612DNAL7 a10.1023/A:10267356058042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGálová, E.10aAnalysis of Some Barley Chlorophyll Mutants and Their Response to Temperature Stress  ap. 29-35.  aSix barley chlorophyll (Chl) mutants, viridis, flavoviridis, chlorina, xanhta, lutea, and albina, differed in the contents of Chl (a+b) and carotenoids (Cars). In accordance with their Chl-deficient phenotype, the Chl a and b and Car contents of mutants decreased from viridis to albina, only xantha had the same or even higher concentration of Cars as the wild type plant. The albina mutant completely lacked and xantha had a significantly reduced photosynthetic activity. We found quantitative differences in protein contents between wild type and mutant plants, with the lowest concentration per fresh mass in the albina mutant. Chl fluorescence analysis revealed that heat-treated barley leaves of both the wild type and Chl mutants had a lower photosystem 2 efficiency than the untreated ones. With 35S-methionine labelling and SDS-PAGE we found that six to nine de novo synthetized proteins appeared after heat shock (2 h, 42 °C) in the wild type and Chl mutants. In albina the expression of heat shock proteins (HSPs) was reduced to 50 % of that in the wild type. Hence mainly albina mutants, with a completely destroyed proteosynthetic apparatus of the chloroplasts, are able to synthesize a small set of HSPs. The albina mutant is a very useful tool for the study of different gene expression of chloroplast and nuclear DNA.  aPublisher supplied data 3abarley 3achlorophyll 3afluorescence 3agene expression 3aheat shock proteins 3aheat stress 3aleaves 3amutants 3anuclear genome 3aphotosystem II 3apolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 3atemperature1 aBöhmová, B.1 aŠevčovičová, A.0 tPhotosynthetica.g2000 Oct., v. 38, no. 1 p.29-35dSpringer-Verlagx0300-36047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1026735605804  aDNAL 7aarticle03099naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001200139245009200151300001800243520197700261592002802238650001602266650002102282650002002303650002002323650002402343650001202367650001902379650001402398650001502412650001402427700001902441700001702460700002202477700002502499773010502524856007502629852000902704655001202713IND60577880020221116195031.0170810e20131210xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057788002DNAL7 a10.1021/ma401833k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMa, Zhe10aShort-Term Flow Induced Crystallization in Isotactic Polypropylene: How Short Is Short?  ap. 9249-9258.  aThe so-called “short-term flow” protocol is widely applied in experimental flow-induced crystallization studies on polymers in order to separate the nucleation and subsequent growth processes [Liedauer et al. Int. Polym. Proc. 1993, 8, 236–244]. The basis of this protocol is the assumption that structure development during flow can be minimized and the rheological behavior, i.e., the viscosity, does not change noticeably. In this work we explore the validity of this assumption for short but strong flows and reveal the structure formation during the early stages of crystallization. Viscosity and structure evolution of an isotactic polypropylene (iPP, Mw ≈ 365 kg/mol and Mw/Mₙ = 5.4) melt at 145 °C are measured during the short-flow period (0.2–0.25 s) using the combination of a slit rheometer and fast X-ray scattering measurements. For high enough (apparent) shear rates (≥240 s–¹) a viscosity rise during flow is observed; i.e., the condition for “short-term flow” is not satisfied. With a time delay with respect to the viscosity rise, the development of shish is observed at a position halfway the length of slit, along the flow direction, by means of ultrafast time-resolved SAXS measurements. Depending on the shear rate, these shish are detected during (shear rates ≥ 400 s–¹) or after flow (240 s–¹ ≤ shear rates < 400 s–¹). For even lower shear rates of 160 and 80 s–¹, the viscosity does not change significantly, and instead of shish, oriented row nuclei (X-ray undetectable) are generated. These two shear conditions qualify as short-term flow. A full understanding of the coupled flow and crystallization phenomena requires that the transient and nonhomogeneous behaviors, both in flow and in flow gradient direction, have to be taken into account. This can only be done by a full numerical model, and therefore, the results presented in this paper also provide a valuable data set for future numerical studies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-radiation 3aX-ray scattering 3acrystallization 3adata collection 3amathematical models 3amelting 3apolypropylenes 3aprotocols 3arheometers 3aviscosity1 aBalzano, Luigi1 avan Erp, Tim1 aPortale, Giuseppe1 aPeters, Gerrit W.

This process is mediated by the interaction of the carbohydrate-binding domain with sugar structures on the cell surface, and this binding can be inhibited by pre-incubation of the lectin with its specific sugars. However, when incubated with insect cells, Orysata, a mannose-binding lectin from rice, caused aggregation of the cells, independent from carbohydrate binding activity. This phenomenon was observed for multiple insect cell lines, confirming the robustness of this phenotype. While the carbohydrate-dependent agglutination of red blood cells happens within minutes, the carbohydrate-independent aggregation of insect cells requires longer incubation times. Further analysis with the galactose-binding lectins SSA and Jacalin, validated the robustness of this lectin-induced, carbohydrate-independent aggregation in different insect cell lines. Since proteomic analysis revealed no changes in the proteome after treatment with the lectins, this cell aggregation is likely caused by the (in) activation or re-organization of the existing surface proteins. The use of inhibitors of phosphorylation and dephosphorylation, staurosporine (STS) and a phosphatase inhibitor (PPI) cocktail, pointed to dephosphorylation as a key mechanism in the lectin-induced, carbohydrate-independent aggregation of insect cells. Similar to contact inhibition, cell proliferation in cell aggregates was decreased. Analysis of the marker for cell proliferation, cyclin E, confirmed that aggregated cells enter a quiescent state. The current data offer a new perspective on the mechanism by which lectins execute their activities, specifically through lectin-induced phosphatase-mediated cell aggregation and proliferation inhibition, independent from their carbohydrate-binding activity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagglutination 3acarbohydrate binding 3acell proliferation 3acyclins 3adephosphorylation 3agalectins 3ainsect physiology 3ainsects 3aphenotype 3aphosphorylation 3aproteome 3aproteomics 3arice 3astaurosporine 3asugars 0aInsect cell 0aPlant lectin 0aOrysata 0aAggregation 0aPhosphatase 0aCell cycle1 aDe Schutter, Kristof1 aPauwels, Jarne1 aGevaert, Kris1 aVan Damme, Els J.M.1 aSmagghe, Guy0 tJournal of insect physiology.g2021 May,  June, v. 131 p.104241-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl45772x0022-19107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jinsphys.2021.1042413Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02957naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094024002200130024001900152040001800171100006400189245010000253300001800353506007600371520127100447592002801718596010501746506003701851650001801888650002201906650002501928650001501953650002501968650003701993650001702030650003202047650001902079651001502098700001902113700001902132700002002151700001902171700002102190700001902211773016602230856008202396852000902478655001202487IND60637030420221207140547.0190413e201903  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063703042DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-019-04281-42doi7 aPMC64696172pmcid7 a307157152pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchönlau, Christine1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4870-647010aAryl hydrocarbon receptor-mediated potencies in field-deployed plastics vary by type of polymer  ap. 9079-9088.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aPlastic is able to sorb environmental pollutants from ambient water and might act as a vector for these pollutants to marine organisms. The potential toxicological effects of plastic-sorbed pollutants in marine organisms have not been thoroughly assessed. In this study, organic extracts from four types of plastic deployed for 9 or 12 months in San Diego Bay, California, were examined for their potential to activate the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) pathway by use of the H4IIE-luc assay. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH), including the 16 priority PAHs, were quantified. The AhR-mediated potency in the deployed plastic samples, calculated as bio-TEQ values, ranged from 2.7 pg/g in polyethylene terephthalate (PET) to 277 pg/g in low-density polyethylene (LDPE). Concentrations of the sum of 24 PAHs in the deployed samples ranged from 4.6 to 1068 ng/g. By use of relative potency factors (REP), a potency balance between the biological effect (bio-TEQs) and the targeted PAHs (chem-TEQs) was calculated to 24–170%. The study reports, for the first time, in vitro AhR-mediated potencies for different deployed plastics, of which LDPE elicited the greatest concentration of bio-TEQs followed by polypropylene (PP), PET, and polyvinylchloride (PVC).  aPublisher supplied data  a223-2014-1064cSwedisch Research Council for Environment, Agricultural Sciences and Spatial Planning0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aambient water 3aaquatic organisms 3abioactive properties 3apollutants 3apoly(vinyl chloride) 3apolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 3apolyethylene 3apolyethylene terephthalates 3apolypropylenes 3aCalifornia1 aLarsson, Maria1 aLam, Monika M.1 aEngwall, Magnus1 aGiesy, John P.1 aRochman, Chelsea1 aKärrman, Anna0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research international.g2019 Mar., v. 26, no. 9 p.9079-9088dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-019-04281-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02745naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002000146245014800166300002000314500001900334520153600353592002801889650001301917650001101930650002201941650001901963650001301982650001301995700002102008700001902029700002202048700006302070773017302133856008002306852000902386655001202395IND60715531620221122204226.0201028e20201016xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071553162DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.iecr.0c035162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGolikov, Alexey10aExtended Rate Constant Distribution Model for Sorption in Heterogeneous Systems: 3. From Batch to Fixed-Bed Application and Predictive Modeling  ap. 19415-19425.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aHere, we have demonstrated that the recently developed extended rate constant distribution (RCD) model for sorption on heterogeneous sorbents can be applied to predict the column behavior of the sorbents using parameters determined from the sorption kinetics in batch. The suggested approach has been validated on the batch and fixed-bed experimental data of Cu(II), Cd(II), and Zn(II) ion sorption on a polyethyleneimine (PEI) cryogel. Although the average sorption rate constants decreased in the order Cu(II) > Zn(II) > Cd(II), “fast” and “slow” sorption centers with different affinities have been identified for all investigated ions. This explained why, depending on the experimental conditions (flow rate and metal ion concentrations), one or another ion from the mixture can adsorb preferentially on PEI in fixed-bed applications, while at long equilibration time, the ratio between adsorbed metal ions was determined by the sorbent affinity. We have also shown that sorption rate constants for the PEI cryogel determined from the batch data were ∼0.6 log units lower than those determined from fixed-bed experiments that proved higher sorption efficiency for this type of sorbent under dynamic conditions. The column efficiency coefficient introduced to the RCD model for the fixed-bed application allowed us to reveal intrinsic and operational defects in soft monolith sorbents materials, which originated from imperfection of fabrication or destruction of the porous structure at high flow rates, respectively.  aPublisher supplied data 3acryogels 3amodels 3apolyethyleneimine 3aprocess design 3asorbents 3asorption1 aMalakhova, Irina1 aPrivar, Yuliya1 aParotkina, Yuliya1 aBratskaya, Svetlana1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4954-04220 tIndustrial & engineering chemistry process design and development.g2020 Oct. 16, v. 59, no. 43 p.19415-19425dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23342x1520-50457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.iecr.0c035163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01473naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002500092040001800117100002000135245010800155300001600263500002000279520041800299592002800717650001100745650002200756650001900778650001400797650002300811650002300834650002000857650001600877651001800893773014300911852000901054856007201063655001201135IND2197473520221119123729.0200105e199811  iau|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND219747352DNAL7 a10.2307/12440642doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGould, Brian W.10aFactors Affecting the Timing of Purchasing of Butter, Margarine, and Blends: A Competing Goods Analysis  ap. 793-805.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe purchase dynamics of a subset of food fats and oils are investigated using event‐history analysis applied to a panel of U.S. households.

The surface snow samples were analyzed for the major water-soluble ions (SO42−, NO3−, F–, Cl–, Na+, K+, Ca2+, Mg2+, and NH4+) and trace element (Al, As, Mn, V, Cd, Cu, Pb, Zn, Fe, Cr, and Ni). The results indicated that the higher concentrations of NO3− and SO42− and the trace elements Zn, Pb, Cd, Ni, and Cu were likely attributable to enhanced local industrial emissions in East Asia especially in China. In addition, snow samples characterized by higher enrichment factors of trace elements (Cu, Cd, As, Zn, Pb) were indicative of an anthropogenic source. Emissions from fossil fuel combustion and biomass burning were likely important contributors to the chemical elements in seasonal snow with long-range transport. On the other hand, the large attribution of K+ appeared in the higher latitude demonstrated that biomass burning was a dominated factor of the chemical species in seasonal snow in the higher latitude of China than that in the lower latitude. Finally, an interannual comparison with the 2010 China snow survey also confirmed the source attributions of chemical speciation in seasonal snow in these regions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaluminum 3aammonium compounds 3aanthropogenic activities 3aarsenic 3aatmospheric chemistry 3abiomass 3aburning 3acadmium 3acalcium 3achemical speciation 3achlorides 3achromium 3acombustion 3acopper 3aemissions 3afluorides 3afossil fuels 3aions 3airon 3alatitude 3alead 3amagnesium 3amanganese 3anickel 3anitrates 3apotassium 3asnow 3asodium 3asulfates 3asurveys 3azinc 3aChina 0aWater-soluble ions 0aTrace elements 0aSeasonal snow 0aEnrichment factors1 aPu, Wei1 aZhang, Xueying1 aRen, Yong1 aHuang, Jianping0 tAtmospheric environment.g2015 Aug., v. 114 p.57-65dElsevier Ltdx1352-23107nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.atmosenv.2015.05.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03061naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100005300147245014100200300001600341520154200357592002801899650002001927650001601947650002701963650001401990650001202004650001102016650001402027650001802041650001802059650001502077650002502092650004302117650002802160650002002188650000902208650001902217650001702236650001202253651001002265700001602275700001602291700001602307700001702323700001402340773011002354856008202464852000902546655001202555IND60590268520221121052258.0180619e201804  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059026852DNAL7 a10.1007/s11119-017-9515-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMorari, F.1http://orcid.org/0000-0001-9081-868X10aOptimising durum wheat cultivation in North Italy: understanding the effects of site-specific fertilization on yield and protein content  ap. 257-277.  aVariable rate fertilization and precision harvesting could increase the potential for meeting durum wheat quality standards. Field spatial distribution of yield and protein content, and their interactions with soil properties and N fertilization were evaluated in an experiment on durum wheat in North Italy in 2011 and 2012. Variable rate fertilization was adopted in three management zones (MZs) with increasing soil fertility, and a foliar N was applied at flowering to investigate differences in protein quantity and quality. During the crop cycle, changes in crop biomass and N status were monitored through NDVI measurement, and grain was sampled in each MZ and gluten proteins extracted at harvest. Spatial variability of yield and protein content was mainly driven by soil texture and base fertilization in both the years, while foliar fertilization was not efficient in enhancing grain protein content. Variable rate fertilization partially mitigated the weather impact; however, unpredictable weather conditions resulted in low N use efficiency. High N rates were confirmed to provide high protein levels and enhance gluten proteins technological quality, but with a risk for the environment. The marked spatial variability in grain quality in terms of total protein and gluten protein content, and the ratio between glutenin/gliadin and high and low-molecular weight glutenin sub-units, suggested the implementation of zone harvesting as a strategy to exploit the positive interaction between grain quality and soil fertility.  aPublisher supplied data 3acrop production 3adurum wheat 3afertilizer application 3aflowering 3agliadin 3agluten 3aglutenins 3agrain protein 3agrain quality 3aharvesting 3anitrogen fertilizers 3anormalized difference vegetation index 3anutrient use efficiency 3aprotein content 3arisk 3asoil fertility 3asoil texture 3aweather 3aItaly1 aZanella, V.1 aSartori, L.1 aVisioli, G.1 aBerzaghi, P.1 aMosca, G.0 tPrecision agriculture.g2018 Apr., v. 19, no. 2 p.257-277dSpringer USwJournal:jnl58474x1385-22567nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11119-017-9515-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03240naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245016800167300001600335520180700351592002802158650001402186650002702200650001802227650001002245650001202255650001402267650001502281650001902296650001502315650001402330650002502344650002002369650001402389650001402403650001102417650001802428650001102446650001902457700002202476700002202498700001902520700002102539773010802560856008102668852000902749655001202758IND60573804420221117235106.0170725e201701  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057380442DNAL7 a10.1007/s00436-016-5301-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCamus, Alvin C.10aMyxobolus axelrodi n. sp.

Parasite impacts were unclear, as additional histopathological findings were present, including bacterial dermatitis and meningitis. Ethanol-preserved specimens pooled from multiple fish were used for morphological characterization of myxospores. Elongate, teardrop myxospores were 20.5 ± 0.7-μm (mean ± SD; range = 19.0–21.8 μm) long, 6.6 ± 0.5-μm (5.7–7.9 μm) wide, and 5.1 ± 0.4-μm (4.8–5.9 μm) thick (valvular width). Two, unequally sized, apical, pyriform polar capsules were in the same plane as the sutural ridge. The larger measured 9.9 ± 0.8-μm (8.0–11.2 μm) long and 3.8 ± 0.3-μm (3.2–4.8 μm) wide. The smaller was 4.1 ± 0.3-μm (3.5–4.5 μm) long and 2.0 ± 0.1-μm (1.8–2.3 μm) wide. Identical 1912 bp 18S rRNA sequences were obtained from two pooled spore samples from tetra brains, which did not match any sequences in the NCBI nr/nt database. Phylogenetically, these parasites grouped loosely within a clade containing Myxobolus spp. from other South American characins and Unicauda spp. from siluriform catfish. Myxospores shared some morphological similarities with Myxobolus inaequus from the unrelated glass knifefish (Order: Gymnotiformes), but were genetically divergent (<85 % similarity) from other myxozoan parasites of South American characins and shared few morphological features or tissue predilection sites. Based on host and tissue tropism, spore morphology, and 18S rRNA sequencing, we report this isolate as a previously unknown species, Myxobolus axelrodi n. sp.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMyxobolus 3aParacheirodon axelrodi 3aSternopygidae 3abrain 3acatfish 3adatabases 3adermatitis 3ahistopathology 3ameningitis 3amortality 3anucleotide sequences 3aornamental fish 3aparasites 3aphylogeny 3aretina 3aribosomal RNA 3aspores 3atissue tropism1 aDill, Jennifer A.1 aRosser, Thomas G.1 aPote, Linda M.1 aGriffin, Matt J.0 tParasitology research.g2017 Jan., v. 116, no. 1 p.387-397dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx0932-01137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00436-016-5301-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03908naa a2200661 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002200151245019500173300001600368520161900384592002802003650001602031650001402047650001102061650001202072650004102084650001402125650001102139650001302150650001102163650001902174650001002193650003202203650001002235650001602245651001102261653001002272653002502282653001102307653005102318653002802369653002402397653004202421653003302463653004702496653004102543653004102584653003202625653003102657653004102688653004002729653004202769700001902811700002802830700002002858700001802878700001902896700005602915700005702971773011103028856008603139852000903225655001203234IND60621747320221121045906.0190516e201906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062174732DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodres.2018.10.0932doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSabbatini, Andrea10aAroma characterization of a wild plant (Sanguisorba albanica) from Kosovo using multiple headspace solid phase microextraction combined with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry-olfactometry  ap. 514-522.  aA wild plant (Sanguisorba albanica) from Kosovo exhibits an appealing aroma, which was perceived as intensely fresh, green, and slightly sweetish with hints of cucumber, melon, and green tea. The characteristic aroma of S. albanica was analyzed for the first time by employing advanced molecular sensory techniques coupled with multiple headspace solid phase microextraction (MHS-SPME). Thirty-six different odor impressions were perceived, and 34 corresponding compounds were identified by a gas chromatography system equipped with a mass spectrometric detector and an olfactory detection port. By aroma dilution analysis, sixteen key odorants with flavor dilution factors higher than 16 were identified. Their respective concentrations were quantified by means of MHS-SPME according to the determined β values (0.43–0.83), and odor activity values (OAVs) were calculated. (E,Z)-2,6-Nonadienal (green, melon-like, and sweetish odor; OAV 20,046), followed by linalool (floral and citrus-like odor; OAV 10,563), (Z)-6-nonenal (cucumber-like, green, and melon-like odor; OAV 4200), ethyl isobutyrate (floral and fruity odor; OAV 1315), and (E)-2-nonenal (green and fatty odor; OAV 1062) were representative odorants contributing to the overall aroma of S. albanica. Differences between stems, leaves, and flowers of S. albanica with regard to the key odorants were also presented. Intensely green and floral aromas of the leaves and flowers were greatly attributed to (E,Z)-2,6-nonadienal and linalool, respectively. Apart from these compounds, (Z)-6-nonenal contributed to the overall aroma of the stems as well.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSanguisorba 3acucumbers 3aflavor 3aflowers 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3agreen tea 3aleaves 3alinalool 3amelons 3aodor compounds 3aodors 3asolid phase microextraction 3astems 3awild plants 3aKosovo 0aAroma 0aSanguisorba albanica 0aKosovo 0aMultiple headspace solid phase microextraction 0aAroma dilution analysis 0aOdor activity value 0aEthyl isobutyrate (PubChem CID: 7342) 0aLinalool (PubChem CID: 6549) 0a(E,Z)-2,6-Nonadienal (PubChem CID: 643731) 0a(E)-2-Nonenal (PubChem CID: 5283335) 0a(Z)-6-Nonenal (PubChem CID: 5362720) 0aHexanal (PubChem CID: 6184) 0aOctanal (PubChem CID: 454) 0a(Z)-3-Hexenol (PubChem CID: 5281167) 0a(Z)-3-Hexenal (PubChem CID: 643941) 0a(Z)-4-Heptenal (PubChem CID: 5362814)1 aJurnatan, Yana1 aFraatz, Marco Alexander1 aGovori, Sevdije1 aHaziri, Arben1 aMillaku, Fadil1 aZorn, Holger1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8383-81961 aZhang, Yanyan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2827-80420 tFood research international.g2019 June, v. 120 p.514-522dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl48420x0963-99697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodres.2018.10.0933Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02238naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002300146245013400169300002000303520110100323592002801424650002201452650001401474650001501488650001201503650000901515650001301524650002301537650001101560650002301571650002201594700001901616700002101635773012901656856008201785852000901867655001201876IND60566990520221118233849.0170417e20161006xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056699052DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.6b072002doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTaufique, M.

N.10aMechanistic Insight into the Attachment of Fullerene Derivatives on Crystal Faces of Methylammonium Lead Iodide Based Perovskites  ap. 22426-22432.  aRecent studies suggest that electron transport layers (ETLs) comprising [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM), employed in planar perovskite solar cells, reduce hysteresis by passivating the deep trap states, thereby underscoring the importance of interfacial structures. To gain physical insights into the PCBM–perovskite interfaces during solution processing, we performed molecular dynamics simulations of PCBMs solvated in chlorobenzene near (110) and (100) perovskite surfaces. Our results indicate strong orientational preferences of deposited PCBMs with the strongest associations between the carbonyl oxygen atom of PCBM and the terminating Pb and H atoms of (110) and (100) faces of perovskite, respectively. The phenyl moiety shows weak associations with the (100) perovskite surface enabling two-pronged anchoring that might facilitate charge transfer. In-plane ordering of PCBMs on perovskite surfaces indicates that a more densely packed monolayer is formed on the (110) surface compared to that on the (100) surface and might lead to more efficient electron transport.  aPublisher supplied data 3aelectron transfer 3afullerene 3ahysteresis 3aiodides 3alead 3amoieties 3amolecular dynamics 3aoxygen 3aphotovoltaic cells 3asimulation models1 aMortuza, S.

However, hydrogel-based carriers are primarily employed for delivering hydrophilic payloads while hydrophobic drugs cannot be efficiently delivered due to the lack of hydrophobic domains within conventional hydrogel matrices. Herein, we report that thermo- and photo-responsive hydrogels could be constructed from amphiphilic triblock copolymers, poly(N-isopropylacrylamide)-b-poly(4-acryloylmorpholine)-b-poly(2-((((2-nitrobenzyl)oxy)carbonyl) amino)ethyl methacrylate) (PNIPAM-b-PNAM-b-PNBOC), and the resulting hydrogels could be further engineered a new carrier for both hydrophilic gemcitabine (GCT) and hydrophobic doxorubicin (DOX). PNIPAM-b-PNAM-b-PNBOC triblock copolymers were first self-assembled into micelles with hydrophobic photosensitive PNBOC cores, hydrophilic PNAM inner shells, and thermoresponsive PNIPAM coronas below the lower critical solution temperature (LCST), while hydrogels of physically cross-linked micellar nanoparticles were achieved at elevated polymer concentrations and high temperatures above the critical gelation temperature (CGT). Rheological experiments revealed that the CGT was highly dependent on polymer compositions and concentrations, that is, a longer hydrophobic PNBOC block or a higher polymer concentration led to a decreased CGT. However, the CGT prior to UV irradiation (CGT0) could be drastically elevated after UV irradiation (CGTUV) as a result of UV irradiation-induced concurrently cross-linking and hydrophobic-to-hydrophilic transition within PNBOC cores. As such, gel-to-sol transition could be accomplished by either temperature decrease or exposure to UV irradiation at a fixed temperature lower than the CGTUV. Note that both GCT and DOX could be simultaneously encapsulated into the hydrogels due to the coexistence of extramicellar aqueous phase and hydrophobic micellar cores. Intriguingly, the subsequent co-release of GCT and DOX could be regulated by taking advantage of either temperature or UV irradiation-mediated gel-to-sol transitions.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiocompatibility 3acomposite polymers 3acrosslinking 3adoxorubicin 3agelatinization temperature 3ahydrogels 3ahydrophilicity 3ahydrophobicity 3amicelles 3ananoparticles 3aphotosensitivity 3asurfactants 3aultraviolet radiation 0aHydrogels 0aPhotoresponsive 0aThermoresponsive 0aSol-gel transition 0aDrug delivery1 aZhang, Guoying1 aLiu, Guhuan1 aHu, Jinming1 aLiu, Shiyong0 tJournal of Controlled Release.g2017 Aug. 10, v. 259 p.149-159dElsevier B.V.x0168-36597nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jconrel.2016.11.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03144naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245012800169300001800297520188500315592002802200650002502228650000902253650001602262650001602278650001702294650001002311650002302321650001202344651000902356651000902365653001502374653002402389653001402413653000902427700002602436700002002462773015702482856008602639852000902725655001202734IND60783632520221116192622.0220720e20220809xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078363252DNAL7 a10.1080/03067319.2020.17562782doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAmarloei, Ali10aStudy of particulate matters concentration and radiation rate in the atmosphere of Ilam city during middle east dust storms  ap. 2394-2402.  aThe possibility of suspending radioactive particles during dust storms from Iraq and entering Iran has always been a concern. The aim of this study was to investigate the particulate matter concentration during dusty days and the effect of dust storm on the irradiation rate in the atmosphere of the city of Ilam (capital of Ilam province). The concentration of particulate matter and radiation dose in the study area were monitored between March 2012 and February 2013 (1 year). Sampling was done every 6 days for periodical days. For the dusty days, samples were gathered according to the forecast information of dust plum entrance by the meteorological organisation. The results showed that the average and standard deviation of PM₁₀, PM₂.₅, and PM₁ concentrations in the periodic sampling (every 6 days) were 76.9 ± 57.1, 17.5 ± 10.5, and 8 ± 4 μg/m³, respectively, and in the dusty days were286 ± 164.8, 54.4 ± 30.3, and 14.6 ± 6.5 μg/m³, respectively. During the study period, the concentration of PM₁₀in 35 days were more than 150 μg/m³ (Dusty day), and June with 13 days was the highest number dusty days. The average radiation dose in normal and dusty days were 0.152 and 0.150 μSv/hr, respectively. The results of Mann–Whitney’s test showed that there was no significant difference between measured radiation in normal and dusty days (P > 0.05). Spearman test showed that there was no significant correlation between radiation doses and PM (PM₁₀, PM₂.₅, and PM₁) (P > 0.05). The results of the study show that dust storms and its concentration intensity did not affect the amount of radiation in the Ilam atmosphere. Because of the high density of the uranium element and its rapid sedimentation near the emission sources, the entry of this contamination related to dust storms to Ilam has not been proven.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanalytical chemistry 3adust 3adust storms 3airradiation 3aparticulates 3aplums 3astandard deviation 3auranium 3aIran 3aIraq 0aDust storm 0aparticulate matters 0aradiation 0aIlam1 aJonaidi Jafari, Ahmad1 aMazloomi, Sajad0 tInternational journal of environmental analytical chemistry.g2022 Aug. 09, v. 102, no. 10 p.2394-2402dTaylor & FranciswJournal:12218x1029-03977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03067319.2020.17562783Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04204naa a2200649 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002400147245011400171300001600285520237800301592002802679650002602707650002602733650001802759650001902777650002202796650001902818650002902837650002202866650002302888650002502911650001102936650000902947650000902956650001802965650001102983650001302994650001703007650001503024650002003039650001603059650001803075650000903093650002403102650000903126650001703135650001103152650001103163650001203174650002603186650001803212650001203230650001103242651001203253700002103265700001903286700001803305700002103323773010803344856008103452852000903533655001203542IND60573804620221117235154.0170725e201701  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057380462DNAL7 a10.1007/s00436-016-5302-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShukullari, Enstela10aParasites and vector-borne diseases in client-owned dogs in Albania: infestation with arthropod ectoparasites  ap. 399-407.  aTo establish the diversity and seasonality of ectoparasite infestation in client-owned dogs in Albania, 602 dogs visiting four small animal clinics in Tirana from March 2010 to April 2011 inclusive were examined for ectoparasites by full body search and total body comb. In addition, ear swab specimens collected from all dogs and scrapings taken from skin lesions suspicious of mite infestation were examined for parasitic mites. Overall, 93 dogs (15.4 %, 95%CI 12.6–18.6) were demonstrated to be infested, and nine species of ectoparasites were identified: Ixodes ricinus, 0.8 %; Rhipicephalus sanguineus s. l., 8.1 %; Demodex canis, 0.2 %; Sarcoptes scabiei, 0.7 %; Otodectes cynotis, 2.8 %; Ctenocephalides canis, 4.8 %; Ctenocephalides felis, 3.0 %; Pulex irritans, 0.2 %; and Trichodectes canis, 0.2 %. Single and multiple infestations with up to four species of ectoparasites concurrently were recorded in 67 (11.1 %, 95%CI 8.7–13.9) and 26 dogs (4.3 %, 95%CI 2.8–6.3), respectively. On univariate analysis, the category of breed (pure breed dogs vs. mixed-breed dogs), the dog’s purpose (pet, hunting dog, working dog), the housing environment (mainly indoors/indoors with regular outside walking vs. yard plus kennel/run), the history of ectoparasiticide treatment and the season of examination were identified as significant (p < 0.05) factors predisposing dogs to various ectoparasites, while the variables dog’s age, gender, the dog’s habitat (city, suburban, rural) and the presence/absence of other pets were not significant predictors. Multivariate logistic regression analysis for factors associated with overall ectoparasitism revealed that dogs treated with ectoparasiticides at least once per year (odds ratio [OR] = 0.24; p < 0.001) had a significantly lower risk of infestation compared with dogs not treated against ectoparasite infestation. Dogs examined during spring, summer and autumn (OR = 7.08, 7.43 and 2.48, respectively; all p < 0.001) had a significantly higher risk of infestation than dogs examined during winter. By providing basic data on the infestation with ectoparasites in client-owned, veterinary-cared-for dogs from Albania for the first time, the results of this survey should emphasize the need of an increase of attention to ectoparasites in dogs by both veterinarians and dog owners.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCtenocephalides canis 3aCtenocephalides felis 3aDemodex canis 3aIxodes ricinus 3aOtodectes cynotis 3aPulex irritans 3aRhipicephalus sanguineus 3aSarcoptes scabiei 3aTrichodectes canis 3aantiparasitic agents 3aautumn 3adogs 3aears 3aectoparasites 3agender 3ahabitats 3amixed breeds 3aodds ratio 3aparasitic mites 3aparasitoses 3apet ownership 3apets 3aregression analysis 3arisk 3askin lesions 3aspring 3asummer 3asurveys 3avector-borne diseases 3aveterinarians 3awalking 3awinter 3aAlbania1 aRapti, Dhimitër1 aVisser, Martin1 aPfister, Kurt1 aRehbein, Steffen0 tParasitology research.g2017 Jan., v. 116, no. 1 p.399-407dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx0932-01137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00436-016-5302-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02759naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002500152245010400177300001400281520169500295592002801990650001602018650001602034650001302050650003802063650001402101650001102115650001102126700002302137700002102160700002302181700002202204773008802226856008602314852000902400655001202409IND60095671320221118085410.0141104e20120615xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009567132DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfb.2012.02.0272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPaiva, José Gabriel10aInteraction of local and general anaesthetics with liposomal membrane models: A QCM-D and DSC study  ap. 65-74.  aThe behaviour of four local anaesthetics (lidocaine, levobupivacaine, ropivacaine and tetracaine) and one general anaesthetic (propofol) is compared when interacting with two types of model membranes: supported layers of liposomes and liposomes in solution. Several liposomal compositions were tested: dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine (DMPC), binary mixtures of DMPC with cholesterol (CHOL), and ternary mixtures of dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC), DMPC, and CHOL. A quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation, QCM-D, was used to assess changes in the properties of supported layers of liposomes. The effect of the anaesthetics on the phase behaviour of the liposomes in suspension was determined by differential scanning calorimetry. Both techniques show that all anaesthetics have a fluidizing effect on the model membranes but, apparently, the solid supported liposomes are less affected by the anaesthetics than the liposomes in solution. Although the different anaesthetics were compared at different concentrations, tetracaine and propofol seem to induce the strongest perturbation on the liposome membrane. The resistance of the liposomes to the anaesthetic action was found to increase with the presence of cholesterol, while adding DPPC to the binary mixture DMPC+CHOL does not change its behaviour. The novelty of the present work resides upon three points: (1) the use of supported layers of liposomes as model membranes to study interactions with anaesthetics; (2) application of QCM-D to assess changes of the adsorbed liposomes; (3) a comparison of the effect of local and general anaesthetics interacting with various model membranes in similar experimental conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanesthetics 3acholesterol 3acolloids 3adifferential scanning calorimetry 3alidocaine 3amodels 3aquartz1 aParadiso, Patrizia1 aSerro, Ana Paula1 aFernandes, Anabela1 aSaramago, Benilde0 tColloids and surfaces.g2012 June 15, v. 95 p.65-74dElsevier B.V.x0927-77657nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfb.2012.02.0273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03186naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004000092040001800132100001800150245011500168300001600283520185000299592002802149650001902177650001802196650001702214650001002231650001302241650002402254650001702278650002002295650001702315650001702332650001602349650001402365650001202379651001102391700002402402700002202426700002002448700001902468700001702487773014102504852000902645856008602654655001202740IND4470229820221119102333.0200511e20130101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447022982DNAL7 a10.1080/14620316.2013.115129802doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOvadia, Rinat10aEffects of plant growth regulators and high temperature on colour development in ‘Crimson Seedless’ grapes  ap. 387-392.  a‘Crimson Seedless’ is a red, seedless table grape (Vitis vinifera) variety which may not develop adequate colour during hot weather. This problem can be alleviated, in part, by applying abscisic acid (ABA). We were interested to determine whether a gibberellin (GA₃), which is used to improve the size of grape berries, might interfere with this response. We were also interested in examining whether short periods of high temperature would affect the response to ABA. In addition, we assessed the optimum time at which to apply ABA, and the role of ethylene in berry colour development. These experiments were conducted in commercial vineyards in Israel, and on detached berries held under controlled conditions. GA₃ had no effect on the response to ABA. There was a mixed response to ethylene, and to the application of ethylene inhibitors in the vineyard or in controlled studies in growth chambers. The best response in terms of colour development (i.e., anthocyanin levels) on detached berries occurred when 200 mg l–¹ ABA was applied in early August. A short period of high temperature did not affect the response to ABA, with similar accumulations of anthocyanins at 18ºC, 25ºC, or 38ºC for 24 h after ABA was applied. These results indicate that: (i) the practice of applying a GA₃ spray to increase berry size did not affect the berry response to ABA; (ii) the responsiveness of grape berries to ABA was maintained for an extended time after the initiation of veraison; (iii) a period of high temperature after the application of ABA did not compromise the response of detached berries to ABA; and (iv) the response of berries to ethylene was not maintained after harvest. The best treatment to enhance colour in ‘Crimson Seedless’ grapes was therefore 200 – 400 mg l–¹ ABA applied 2 – 3 weeks after veraison.  aPublisher supplied data 3aVitis vinifera 3aabscisic acid 3aanthocyanins 3acolor 3aethylene 3aethylene inhibitors 3agibberellins 3agrowth chambers 3asmall fruits 3atable grapes 3atemperature 3avineyards 3aweather 3aIsrael1 aOren-Shamir, Michal1 aKaplunov, Tatiana1 aZutahy, Yohanan1 aLichter, Amnon1 aLurie, Susan0 tJournal of horticultural science & biotechnology.g2013 Jan. 1, v. 88, no. 4 p.387-392dTaylor & FranciswJournal:12181x2380-40847nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14620316.2013.115129803Available from publisher's site 7aarticle02790naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002500152245012600177300001400303520129600317592002801613650002001641650001601661650001701677650002301694650001301717650001801730650002601748650001001774650001401784650001901798650002501817650001301842650000901855650001101864650001501875650002301890650003701913650002801950700002101978700002501999700002302024700001902047700001602066700001902082773008802101856008602189852000902275655001202284IND60095671420221118085426.0141104e20120615xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009567142DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfb.2012.02.0242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aArab Tehrany, Elmira10aElaboration and characterization of nanoliposome made of soya; rapeseed and salmon lecithins: Application to cell culture  ap. 75-81.  aHealth benefits of unsaturated fatty acids have been demonstrated over the last decades. Nanotechnology provided new process to produce particles such as liposomes and nanoliposomes made of pure phospholipids. These techniques are already used in pharmaceutics to augment the bioavailability and the bioefficiency of drugs. The aim of this paper is to characterize and evaluate the potential of nanoliposomes made of three lecithins (soya, rapeseed and salmon) on cell culture in order to use them in the future as drug delivery systems for tissue engineering. We began to measure, with zetasizer, the radius size of liposomes particles which are 125.5, 136.7 and 130.3nm respectively for rapeseed, soya and salmon lecithin. Simultaneously, solutions observed by TEM demonstrated the particles were made much of liposomes than droplet (emulsion). Finally, we found that the solutions of lecithins were enough stable over 5 days at 37°C to be used in culture medium. We investigated the effect of soya, rapeseed and salmon lecithin liposome from 2mg/mL to 5.2μg/mL on metabolic activity and cell proliferation on rat bone marrow stem cells (rBMSC) during 14 days. The results showed that the three lecithins (soya, rapeseed and salmon) improve cell proliferation at different concentration.  aPublisher supplied data 3abioavailability 3abone marrow 3acell culture 3acell proliferation 3acolloids 3aculture media 3adrug delivery systems 3adrugs 3aemulsions 3ananotechnology 3aphosphatidylcholines 3arapeseed 3arats 3asalmon 3astem cells 3atissue engineering 3atransmission electron microscopy 3aunsaturated fatty acids1 aKahn, Cyril J.F.1 aBaravian, Christophe1 aMaherani, Behnoush1 aBelhaj, Nabila1 aWang, Xiong1 aLinder, Michel0 tColloids and surfaces.g2012 June 15, v. 95 p.75-81dElsevier B.V.x0927-77657nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfb.2012.02.0243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02667naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005400150245017200204300002000376500001900396520136700415592002801782650003701810650002801847650001701875650001901892650001301911650001701924650001601941700001701957700001501974700005901989700001802048700001802066773011602084856008402200852000902284655001202293IND60709093620221120052725.0200902e20200810xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070909362DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.langmuir.0c020802doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Meng1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0195-188212aA Contrastive Investigation on the Anticorrosive Performance of Stearic Acid and Fluoroalkylsilane-Modified Superhydrophobic Surface in Salt, Alkali, and Acid Solution  ap. 10279-10292.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aStearic acid and fluoroalkylsilane are widely used in chemical modification to fabricate superhydrophobic surfaces in corrosion-resistant exploration. However, extensive works have just explored their anticorrosive performance in salt solution. Very rare work has focused on comparing their corrosion-resistant performance in corrosive solution (salt, alkali, and acid) systematically. In this study, two kinds of superhydrophobic surfaces were obtained on laser-processed rough IN304 surface after the stearic acid and FAS modification processes, respectively. The investigation and comparison of anticorrosion performance in salt, alkali, and acid electrolyte were carried out via potentiodynamic polarization and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurements. The promotion mechanism or impairing mechanism was further proposed based on the results of surface wettability, surface morphology, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Besides, the long-term anticorrosion performance and the stability of surface wettability were also investigated. It is hoped that these research findings could provide an explicit guidance of suitable anticorrosion methods selection for metals in different kinds of corrosive solution (salt, alkali, and acid), which will further raise the promising prospect of functional surfaces for practical applications in industry.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3adielectric spectroscopy 3aelectrolytes 3ahydrophobicity 3aindustry 3astearic acid 3awettability1 aZhang, Dawei1 aYang, Zhen1 aYang, Chengjuan1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6868-411X1 aTian, Yanling1 aLiu, Xianping0 tLangmuir.g2020 Aug. 10, v. 36, no. 34 p.10279-10292dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19170x1520-58277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.langmuir.0c020803Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02486naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002100152245014300173300001600316520103500332592002801367650001301395650001401408650001301422650001601435650002101451650001501472650002201487650001301509650001901522650001601541650002501557650001101582650001901593650002101612650002001633653001901653653003001672653001301702653001301715653002501728700002001753700002801773773010701801856008701908852000901995655001202004IND60536621220221116143742.0190409e201509  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053662122DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2015.04.1092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJadhav, Dipak A.10aEnhancing the power generation in microbial fuel cells with effective utilization of goethite recovered from mining mud as anodic catalyst  ap. 110-116.  aCatalytic effect of goethite recovered from iron-ore mining mud was studied in microbial fuel cells (MFCs). Characterization of material recovered from mining mud confirms the recovery of iron oxide as goethite. Heat treated goethite (550°C) and untreated raw goethite were coated on stainless-steel anode of MFC-1 and MFC-2, respectively; whereas, unmodified stainless-steel anode was used in MFC-3 (control). Fivefold increment in power was obtained in MFC-1 (17.1W/m3 at 20Ω) than MFC-3 (3.5W/m3). MFC with raw goethite coated anode also showed enhanced power (11W/m3). Higher Coulombic efficiency (34%) was achieved in MFC-1 than control MFC-3 (13%). Decrease in mass-transport losses and higher redox current during electrochemical analyses support improved electron transfer with the use of goethite on anode. Cheaper goethite coating kinetically accelerates the electron transfer between bacteria and anode, proving to be a novel approach for enhancing the electricity generation along with organic matter removal in MFC.  aPublisher supplied data 3abacteria 3acatalysts 3acoatings 3aelectricity 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3aelectron transfer 3agoethite 3aheat treatment 3airon oxides 3amicrobial fuel cells 3amining 3aorganic matter 3apower generation 3astainless steel 0aAnode catalyst 0aElectro-chemical analysis 0aGoethite 0aHematite 0aMicrobial fuel cells1 aGhadge, Anil N.1 aGhangrekar, Makarand M.0 tBioresource technology.g2015 Sept., v. 191 p.110-116dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46263x0960-85247nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2015.04.1093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02557naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100003100151245009700182300001600279520111300295536015301408592002801561650001501589650001501604650001501619650002601634650001501660650001601675650001601691650000901707653002101716653001701737653001501754700002601769700002601795700002401821700003501845700002001880773014001900856008602040852000902126655001202135IND60783632720221116192426.0220720e20220714xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078363272DNAL7 a10.1080/03601234.2022.20699822doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGonzalo Mayoral, Eliana S.10aGlyphosate, AMPA, and metsulfuron-methyl retention in the main horizons of a Typic Argiudoll  ap. 526-540.  aRetention is one of the processes controlling the behavior and fate of pesticides in soil. The objective of this work was to evaluate the adsorption and desorption of glyphosate, AMPA, and metsulfuron-methyl in the main horizons of a Typic Argiudoll destined for agricultural use. For this purpose, the batch equilibrium method was used at a range of concentrations for each compound. Desorption was performed in three consecutive steps after the adsorption experiment. The results obtained showed strong adsorption of glyphosate and AMPA in the three horizons, following the trend B > A > C, with weak desorption. Metsulfuron-methyl, on the other hand, showed weak adsorption in the three horizons, following the trend A > B > C, with relevant desorption. Our results allow us to identify metsulfuron-methyl as the compound that poses the greatest environmental risk in terms of the potential contamination of other areas and groundwater. However, despite their strong adsorption and weak desorption, glyphosate and AMPA also represent potential contaminants of other environmental matrices.  aFunding for this study was provided by PN Suelo 1134044 (INTA) and PICT 2014-1462 (FONCyT- Fondo para la Investigación Científica y Tecnológica).  aPublisher supplied data 3aArgiudolls 3aadsorption 3adesorption 3aenvironmental science 3aglyphosate 3agroundwater 3ametsulfuron 3arisk 0aFreundlich model 0asoil profile 0apesticides1 aAparicio, Virginia C.1 aDe Gerónimo, Eduardo1 aFernandes, Gracieli1 aRheinheimer dos Santos, Danilo1 aCosta, José L.0 tJournal of environmental science and health.g2022 July 14, v. 57, no. 7 p.526-540dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl11541x1532-41097nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03601234.2022.20699823Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02909naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245010700169500001400276520124600290592002801536650001601564650002401580650001001604650001801614650001001632650002401642650001301666650001901679650001301698650001701711650001301728650001601741650001101757650001401768650001101782650002201793650001501815650001901830650001101849650001401860650002001874700002101894700002501915700002801940700002301968700002401991700002102015700002602036700002402062700002302086773012802109856008502237852000902322655001202331IND60721696220221123013539.0201224e20201210xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072169622DNAL7 a10.3390/microorganisms81219582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWiatr, Marie 10aEchovirus-30 Infection Alters Host Proteins in Lipid Rafts at the Cerebrospinal Fluid Barrier In Vitro  aNAL-light  aEchovirus-30 (E-30) is a non-polio enterovirus responsible for meningitis outbreaks in children worldwide. To gain access to the central nervous system (CNS), E-30 first has to cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB) or the blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier (BCSFB). E-30 may use lipid rafts of the host cells to interact with and to invade the BCSFB. To study enteroviral infection of the BCSFB, an established in vitro model based on human immortalized brain choroid plexus papilloma (HIBCPP) cells has been used. Here, we investigated the impact of E-30 infection on the protein content of the lipid rafts at the BCSFB in vitro. Mass spectrometry analysis following E-30 infection versus uninfected conditions revealed differential abundancy in proteins implicated in cellular adhesion, cytoskeleton remodeling, and endocytosis/vesicle budding. Further, we evaluated the blocking of endocytosis via clathrin/dynamin blocking and its consequences for E-30 induced barrier disruption. Interestingly, blocking of endocytosis had no impact on the capacity of E-30 to induce loss of barrier properties in HIBCPP cells. Altogether, these data highlight the impact of E-30 on HIBCPP cells microdomain as an important factor for host cell alteration.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEnterovirus 3ablood-brain barrier 3abrain 3acell adhesion 3acells 3acerebrospinal fluid 3achildren 3achoroid plexus 3aclathrin 3acytoskeleton 3adynamins 3aendocytosis 3ahumans 3ainfection 3alipids 3amass spectrometry 3ameningitis 3amicroorganisms 3amodels 3apapilloma 3aprotein content1 aStaubach, Simon 1 aFigueiredo, Ricardo 1 aStump-Guthier, Carolin 1 aIshikawa, Hiroshi 1 aSchwerk, Christian 1 aSchroten, Horst 1 aHanisch, Franz-Georg 1 aRudolph, Henriette 1 aTenenbaum, Tobias 0 tMicroorganisms.g2020 Dec. 10, v. 8, no. 12dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27145x2076-26077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/microorganisms81219583Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02235naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100002300112245008000135300001400215500001900229520104800248592002801296650001401324650001301338650001401351650001701365650001701382650001501399650001301414651001001427653001401437653002501451653001001476653001801486700001701504700001701521700001701538700001701555700001601572700001901588700001901607700001401626773014001640852000901780655001201789IND60705164320221116195005.0200908e201203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070516432DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGangopadhyay, K.K.10aStability analysis of yield and its component traits in fenugreek germplasm  ap. 79-85.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aStability and sustainability index studies were performed in 55 fenugreek genotypes including four check varieties during rabi 2005–06 and 2006–07 at CCSHAU, Hisar; RAU, Pusa; NDUA&T, Faizabad and in rabi 2005–06 at NBPGR, New Delhi alongwith per se performance.

While PSNPs are also cytocompatible and degradable, PSNP integration into composite structures can be a useful approach to enhance carrier colloidal stability, drug-cargo loading stability, and endosome escape. Here, we explored PSNP polymer composites formed by coating of oxidized PSNPs with a series of poly[ethylene glycol-block-(dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate-co-butyl methacrylate)] (PEG-DB) diblock copolymers with varied molar ratios of dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate (D) and butyl methacrylate (B) in the random copolymer block. We screened and developed PSNP composites specifically toward intracellular delivery of microRNA inhibitory peptide nucleic acids (PNA). While a copolymer with 50 mol % B (50B) is optimal for early endosome escape in free polymer form, its pH switch was suppressed when it was formed into 50B polymer-coated PSNP composites (50BCs). We demonstrate that a lower mol % B (30BC) is the ideal PEG-DB composition for PSNP/PEG-DB nanocomposites based on having both the highest endosome disruption potential and miR-122 inhibitory activity. At a 1 mM PNA dose, 30BCs facilitated more potent inhibition of miR-122 in comparison to 40BC (p = 0.0095), 50BC (p < 0.0001), or an anti-miR-122 oligonucleotide delivered with the commercial transfection reagent Fugene 6. Using a live cell galectin 8-based endosome disruption reporter, 30BCs had greater endosomal escape than 40BCs and 50BCs within 2 h after treatment, suggesting that rapid endosome escape correlates with higher intracellular bioactivity. This study provides new insight on the polymer structure-dependent effects on stability, endosome escape, and cargo intracellular bioavailability for endosomolytic polymer-coated PSNPs.  aPublisher supplied data 3abioactive properties 3abioavailability 3acoatings 3acomposite polymers 3adrugs 3aethylene 3agalectins 3amicroRNA 3ananocomposites 3ananoparticles 3aoligonucleotides 3aoxidation 3apH 3apeptides 3asilicon 3atransfection 0aporous silicon nanoparticles 0aendosomal escape 0agalectin-8 0amicro-RNA 0apeptide nucleic acid1 aFletcher, R.

This paper considers both the influence of thermal stratification and the presence of a single obstacle on pollutant dispersion in turbulent boundary layers (TBLs). Turbulent flow over a fence with line sources of pollutant in its vicinity is simulated by means of Large-Eddy Simulations. Separate ‘driver’ simulations are done to generate the inflow TBL for several levels of stratification. Using these inflow TBLs the flow development and pollutant dispersion behind the fence, up to 100 fence heights, h, is investigated. It is shown that the decay of velocity and temperature deficit is independent of stability, while the decay of Reynolds stress and concentration excess decreases with increasing stability. For neutral cases the influence of the obstacle is gone after approximately 75h, while for stable cases near the ground the flow is still accelerated compared to the undisturbed case. The fence does cause a local reduction of stratification and thereby increased pollutant dispersion. However, neglecting the effect of buoyancy results in an underestimation of pollutant concentration by a factor 2.5 at 75h downstream of the emission source for the most stable case.  aPublisher supplied data 3aatmospheric chemistry 3ageometry 3apollutants 3aprediction 3atemperature profiles 3aturbulent flow 3aurban areas 0aStratification 0aBoundary layer 0aObstacle 0aPollutant dispersion 0aTurbulence 0aWake1 aPourquie, M.J.B.M.1 aJonker, H.J.J.0 tAtmospheric environment.g2015 July, v. 113 p.236-246dElsevier Ltdx1352-23107nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.atmosenv.2015.05.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01484naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002500092040001800117100001900135245003800154300001400192500002000206520056200226592002800788650001900816650001100835650000900846650001400855650001100869650002400880650002300904650000900927773014100936852000901077856007201086655001201158IND2201623120221121220831.0200105e199902  iau|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220162312DNAL7 a10.2307/12444512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMahul, Olivier10aOptimum Area Yield Crop Insurance  ap. 75-82.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThis article considers the problem of the optimal design of crop insurance when the indemnity is based upon the aggregate yield of a surrounding area. The optimal area yield crop insurance contract depends on the individual beta coefficient which measures the sensitivity of farm yield to area yield. Indemnity payments are made whenever the realized area yield is lower (higher) than a critical yield if the beta coefficient is positive (negative). The optimal contract contains a “disappearing deductible” if the beta coefficient is higher than unity.  aPublisher supplied data 3acrop insurance 3ayields 3aarea 3aequations 3adesign 3amathematical models 3afarmers' attitudes 3arisk0 tAmerican journal of agricultural economics.g1999 Feb., v. 81, no. 1 p.75-82dOxford University PresswJournal:jnl44932x0002-90927nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2307/12444513Available from publisher's site 7aarticle03369naa a2200649 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100002000154245010600174520166400280592002801944650001701972650001501989650001102004650001202015650001602027650001802043650002102061650002502082650001502107650002002122650001602142650001102158653001302169653002802182653002102210653001602231653002502247653002102272653000702293653000902300653000802309653000702317653000902324653000702333653000802340653000902348653000702357653000902364653000802373653000802381653000802389653000802397653000702405653000902412700001702421700002002438700002802458700002102486773010202507856008902609852000902698655001202707IND60778162120221120234809.0220929e202211  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077816212DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biotechadv.2022.1079872doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPardilhó, Sara10aMarine macroalgae in a circular economy context: A comprehensive analysis focused on residual biomass  aThe accumulation of Marine Macroalgal Waste (MMW) - drifted marine macroalgae - is a growing phenomenon. The lack of appropriate management protocols for this residual biomass leaves it mostly unmanaged or disposed of in landfills. Such inappropriate solutions lead to negative environmental impacts, health concerns and coastal degradation, representing an opportunity to develop the bioeconomy. Although a relevant number of studies exists on the use of edible marine macroalgae for several purposes, there is generally a lack of information concerning MMW valorisation, at both local and global scales. This review thus explores the ecological and biotechnological potential for the establishment of a new approach for MMW valorisation based in the circular and blue economies. It is supported in literature on the use of residual biomass whenever possible and also includes studies with fresh biomass to extrapolate, considering known characteristics of MMW; consequently, a roadmap for its utilisation is provided. The review includes characteristics of various seaweeds, MMW accumulation worldwide and traditional uses, together with the development of alternative and integrated valorisation strategies. By analysing a large number of studies, it was possible to perceive a clear potential to explore MMW to obtain renewable fuels, especially biogas and bioethanol and for use in agricultural activities. Allied to this, the extraction of value-added compounds, such as lipids, pigments, phenolic compounds and specific polysaccharides is highlighted, aiming to contribute to the development of an economically feasible zero-waste biorefinery approach.  aPublisher supplied data 3abioeconomics 3abioethanol 3abiogas 3abiomass 3abiorefining 3abiotechnology 3acircular economy 3aeconomic feasibility 3amacroalgae 3apolysaccharides 3avalue added 3awastes 0aSeaweeds 0aMarine macroalgal waste 0aBiomass recovery 0aBiorefinery 0aCascade valorisation 0aCircular economy 0aAD 0aASTM 0aC:N 0aFA 0aFAME 0aMM 0aMMW 0aMUFA 0aPT 0aPUFA 0aSFA 0aSHF 0aSSF 0aVFA 0aVS 0aWWTP1 aCotas, João1 aPereira, Leonel1 aOliveira, Maria Beatriz1 aDias, Joana Maia0 tBiotechnology advances.g2022 Nov., v. 60 p.107987-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:6288x0734-97507nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biotechadv.2022.1079873Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03019naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002000152245013100172300001600303520176400319592002802083650002502111650001602136650001502152650001602167650002302183650001602206650000902222650001502231650001602246653001902262653002102281653002802302653001702330700001402347700001502361700001302376773012402389856008702513852000902600655001202609IND60766678920220221000000.0220209e20020301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076667892DNAL7 a10.1556/agrokem.51.2002.1-2.302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKuti, László,10aFluctuation of the Groundwater Level, and Its Consequences in the Soil-Parent Material-Groundwater System of a Sodic Grassland  ap. 253-262.  aOur data verified the relationship between meteorological factors and the fluctuation of the groundwater level. The rate of evaporation dominantly affected the rise and depth of the groundwater level. It is characteristic for the study site that there is an inverse relationship between the elevation of the groundwater observation wells and the depth of groundwater, and the difference between the levels of groundwater in the separate wells reflected the differences in the elevation between the wells. Our observations refuted our previous assumptions, as in the wells not only the concentration of salts changed but also the chemical type of the water. This can be attributed with great probability to the lateral flow of the groundwater, which is caused by the vertical fluctuation, but can be caused by other geological factors as well. We reached the conclusion that the vertical and sometimes lateral movement of the groundwater affects the development of soils in a given area. It means that the reason behind the mosaic-like appearance of the soil cover of a given area can be searched in the local differences of the chemical composition of the groundwater, which is a major factor of the spatial variability of the salt accumulation of soils. The observations and analytical results point to that the soils of the study site have developed under the effect of fluctuating groundwater and the elevation is a dominant factor of the spatial variability of the soil salt accumulation. The level of groundwater, the flow of groundwater and its composition show relationship with the surface elevation, and their effect is modified by the geological stratification, which results in a variable appearance of soil salt accumulation and native vegetation.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical composition 3aevaporation 3agrasslands 3agroundwater 3aindigenous species 3aprobability 3asoil 3asoil salts 3awater table 0asoil formation 0agroundwater flow 0agroundwater composition 0asalinization1 aTóth, T.1 aKerék, B.1 aet al., 0 tAgrokémia és talajtan.g2002 Mar. 1, v. 51, no. 1-2 p.253-262dAkadémiai KiadówJournal:J000000044x1588-27137nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1556/agrokem.51.2002.1-2.303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03174naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100002900154245008100183520165600264592002801920650001801948650001501966650001501981650001801996650001002014650002102024650002202045650002102067650001502088650002202103650001902125653001502144653002602159653001602185653001602201653002202217653002002239653002102259653001602280653001902296700002302315700001902338700002002357700003002377700003002407700001902437773010202456856008902558852000902647655001202656IND60778162220221120234757.0220929e202210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077816222DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biotechadv.2022.1079882doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDawiec-Liśniewska, Anna10aNew trends in biotechnological applications of photosynthetic microorganisms  aAs a source of several valuable products, photosynthetic microorganisms (microalgae and cyanobacteria) have many applications in biomedical, electrochemical, and urban-space fields. Microalgal and cyanobacterial (photoautotrophs) implementations have been the subject matter of several reviews, which mainly focused on exploring effective methods of their harvesting, optimal cultivation conditions, energy conversion efficiency, and new strategies for microalgal health-promoting compound recovery. This review highlights recent investigations into biomedical, urban, environmental, and electrical engineering microalgae and cyanobacteria applications over the last seven years. A brief historical outline of advances in photoautotroph-based technologies is presented prior to an exploration of the important role of these microorganisms in combating global warming and food and energy insecurity. Special attention is given to the photosynthetic oxygen production of algae and the possibility of treating hypoxia-associated diseases such as cancer or tissue injuries. Photoautotroph applications in microrobotics, drug delivery and wound healing systems, biosensors, and bioelectronics are also introduced and discussed. Finally, we present emerging fabrication techniques, such as additive manufacturing, that unleash the full potential of autotrophic, self-sufficient microorganisms at both the micro- and macroscales. This review constitutes an original contribution to photoautotroph biotechnology and is thought to be impactful in determining the future roles of microalgae and cyanobacteria in medical, electrical, or urban space applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCyanobacteria 3aautotrophs 3abiosensors 3abiotechnology 3adrugs 3aelectrochemistry 3aenergy conversion 3afunctional foods 3amicroalgae 3aoxygen production 3aphotosynthesis 0aMicroalgae 0aDrug delivery systems 0aMicrorobots 0aBioprinting 0aArtificial tissue 0aFunctional food 0aBiophotovoltaics 0aUrban space 0aImmobilization1 aPodstawczyk, Daria1 aBastrzyk, Anna1 aCzuba, Krystian1 aPacyna-Iwanicka, Kornelia1 aOkoro, Oseweuba Valentine1 aShavandi, Amin0 tBiotechnology advances.g2022 Oct., v. 59 p.107988-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:6288x0734-97507nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biotechadv.2022.1079883Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01926naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245020100166300001400367520083100381592002801212650001201240650002601252650001701278650001601295650001701311650002001328700001701348700001901365773013701384856008201521852000901603655001201612IND60590269320221121021443.0180619e201801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059026932DNAL7 a10.1134/S10623604180100832doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZakharov, V.M.10aRole of assessment of the health of the environment for characterizing the impact of environmental factors on human health (Assessment of health of humans and the environment: Possible approaches)  ap. 12-17.  aThe assessment of the role of environmental factors in providing human health is very important. However, the obtaining of such assessments in practice is associated with considerable difficulties. Certain information on the environmental auspiciousness for the health of living beings can be obtained by using the health of environment methodology associated with the assessment of the condition of natural populations of different species of animals and plants by the developmental homeostasis. The experience of parallel studies of the health of humans and the environment indicates the prospects of using such estimates for a approximate characterization of the auspiciousness of a certain impact or quality of the environment to human health as well as for interpreting the results obtained in environmental epidemiology.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimals 3aenvironmental factors 3aepidemiology 3ahomeostasis 3ahuman health 3aplants (botany)1 aRevich, B.A.1 aTrofimov, I.E.0 tRussian journal of developmental biology.g2018 Jan., v. 49, no. 1 p.12-17dPleiades PublishingwJournal:jnl4237922x1062-36047nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1134/S10623604180100833Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02827naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002000146245010600166300001600272500001900288520135000307592002801657650001101685650001601696650001901712650001901731650001701750650001401767650001401781650001701795650001801812650002101830650001201851650001201863650001401875650001601889650001501905651001101920653002301931653001801954653001501972653001901987700001702006700002202023700002102045700002302066773013102089856008002220852000902300655001202309IND60711546420221121090531.0200928e20200801xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071154642DNAL7 a10.2478/prolas-2020-00362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKučāne, Linda10aEpidemiological, Clinical and Morphological Characteristics of Immunoglobulin a Nephropathy in Latvia  ap. 227-231.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aImmunoglobulin A nephropathy (IgAN) is the most common chronic glomerulopathy with variable clinical manifestations. IgAN diagnostics became possible in Latvia in 2013. The study aim was to describe IgAN manifestations in the Latvian population by analysing epidemiological, clinical, histological data, and reveal factors that might determine the course of the disease. The retrospective, one-centre study included biopsy-proven IgAN patients over a five-year period in the Nephrology Centre at Pauls Stradiņš Clinical University Hospital. Data from inpatient and outpatient medical records were collected. The study included 69 patients with histologically confirmed IgAN (23% of all renal biopsies): 52% men with mean age of 37. More than a half of them had hypertension, changes in urinalysis and kidney structure, and GFR < ml/min before the biopsy. Pathology data stratified by MEST-C score were: M1 (93%), E1 (5%), S1 (81%), T1 and T2 (24%), C1 (18%). 20% started renal replacement therapy (RRT). Proteinuria, obesity, hyperuricemia, high total MEST-C score, and low serum C3 were associated with a worse prognosis. As a significant part of patients start RRT in the five-year period after the biopsy, the disease course is not benign. IgAN in the study population was diagnosed with clinical and histological signs of advanced disease.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiopsy 3ablood serum 3adisease course 3aglomerulopathy 3ahemodialysis 3ahistology 3ahospitals 3ahypertension 3ahyperuricemia 3aimmunoglobulin A 3akidneys 3aobesity 3aprognosis 3aproteinuria 3aurinalysis 3aLatvia 0aglomerulonephritis 0akidney biopsy 0anephrology 0akidney disease1 aPopova, Anna1 aKuzema, Viktorija1 aLejnieks, Aivars1 aPētersons, Aivars0 tProceedings of the Latvian Academy of Sciences.g2020 Aug. 01, v. 74, no. 4 p.227-231dSciendowJournal:21686x2255-890X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2478/prolas-2020-00363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03838naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100003600147245019300183300001600376520193000392592002802322650002202350650001902372650002502391650001702416650001902433650001102452650002002463650001302483650002202496650001702518650001702535650001902552650004102571650001502612650001102627650002002638650002802658650002702686650002802713650001302741650002102754650000902775651001802784700003202802700003002834700002402864700002602888700003702914700004902951700003203000700001803032773010803050856008103158852000903239655001203248IND60573805220221117235157.0170725e201701  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057380522DNAL7 a10.1007/s00436-016-5305-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPoliti, Flávio Augusto Sanches10aInsecticidal activity of an essential oil of Tagetes patula L.

In this sense, natural products can play a major role. Tagetes patula, popularly known as dwarf marigold, is a plant native to North America with biocide potential. The aim of this work was to evaluate the biological activity of T. patula essential oil (EO) against adult common bed bugs via exposure to dry residues by the Impregnated Paper Disk Test (IPDT) using cypermethrin as a positive control. We selected the enzyme acetylcholinesterase as a target for modeling studies, with the intent of investigating the molecular basis of any biological activity of the EO. Chemical analysis of the EO was performed using gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Additionally, oral and dermal acute toxicity tests were performed according to Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) guidelines. The sulforhodamine B assay (SRB) was performed to verify the cytotoxicity of EO to HaCaT cells. The EO eliminated 100 % of the bed bugs at 100 mg mL⁻¹ with an LC₅₀ value of 15.85 mg mL⁻¹. GC-MS analysis identified α-terpinolene, limonene, piperitenone, and piperitone as major components of the mixture. Molecular modeling studies of these major compounds suggested that they are acetylcholinesterase inhibitors with good steric and electronic complementarity. The in vitro cytotoxicity evaluation revealed a LC₅₀ = 37.06 μg mL⁻¹ and in vivo acute toxicity showed an LC₅₀ >4000 mg kg⁻¹, indicating that the EO presents low risk of toxic side effects in humans. The T. patula essential oil components provide a promising strategy for controlling bed bug populations with low mammalian toxicity. These findings pave the way for further in vivo studies aimed at developing a safe and effective insecticide.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCimex lectularius 3aTagetes patula 3aacetylcholinesterase 3aactive sites 3aacute toxicity 3aadults 3aadverse effects 3abiocides 3achemical analysis 3acypermethrin 3acytotoxicity 3aessential oils 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3aguidelines 3ahumans 3ain vivo studies 3ainsecticidal properties 3ainsecticide resistance 3alethal concentration 50 3alimonene 3amolecular models 3arisk 3aNorth America1 aNascimento, Juliana Damieli1 ada Silva, Alexander Alves1 aMoro, Isabela Jacob1 aGarcia, Mariana Lopes1 aGuido, Rafael Victório Carvalho1 aPietro, Rosemeire Cristina Linhari Rodrigues1 aGodinho, Antônio Francisco1 aFurlan, Maysa0 tParasitology research.g2017 Jan., v. 116, no. 1 p.415-424dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx0932-01137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00436-016-5305-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle05152naa a2200805 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002100111024003100132040001800163100001800181245015800199300001800357520269700375592002803072650001303100650000803113650001303121650001903134650001203153650001003165650001603175650001403191650001903205650001703224650001603241650001803257650001503275650001703290650002003307650001403327650001703341650001103358650001803369650001403387650001203401650001803413650001203431650000903443650001303452650001903465650001203484650002803496650000703524650001703531650002203548650004703570650001203617650002903629650002303658650002103681650001103702650002603713650002103739650002603760651002903786700001903815700001703834700002003851700001403871773009903885856011203984856007704096956013904173961001304312852000904325655001204334IND4462346320221120130658.0141101e201106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446234632DNAL7 a216057772pmid7 a10113/538702hdl7 a10.3168/jds.2010-40112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAguerre, M.J.10aEffect of forage-to-concentrate ratio in dairy cow diets on emission of methane, carbon dioxide, and ammonia, lactation performance, and manure excretion  ap. 3081-3093.  aHolstein cows housed in a modified tie-stall barn were used to determine the effect of feeding diets with different forage-to-concentrate ratios (F:C) on performance and emission of CH₄, CO₂ and manure NH₃-N. Eight multiparous cows (means ± standard deviation): 620±68kg of body weight; 52±34 d in milk and 8 primiparous cows (546±38kg of body weight; 93±39 d in milk) were randomly assigned to 1 of 4 air-flow controlled chambers, constructed to fit 4 cows each. Chambers were assigned to dietary treatment sequences in a single 4×4 Latin square design. Dietary treatments, fed as 16.2% crude protein total mixed rations included the following F:C ratio: 47:53, 54:46, 61:39, and 68:32 [diet dry matter (DM) basis]. Forage consisted of alfalfa silage and corn silage in a 1:1 ratio. Cow performance and emission data were measured on the last 7 d and the last 4 d, respectively of each 21-d period. Air samples entering and exiting each chamber were analyzed with a photo-acoustic field gas monitor. In a companion study, fermentation pattern was studied in 8 rumen-cannulated cows. Increasing F:C ratio in the diet had no effect on DM intake (21.1±1.5kg/d), energy-corrected milk (ECM, 37.4±2.2kg/d), ECM/DM intake (1.81±0.18), yield of milk fat, and manure excretion and composition; however, it increased milk fat content linearly by 7% and decreased linearly true protein, lactose, and solids-not-fat content (by 4, 1, and 2%, respectively) and yield (by 10, 6, and 6%, respectively), and milk N-to-N intake ratio. On average 93% of the N consumed by the cows in the chambers was accounted for as milk N, manure N, or emitted NH₃-N. Increasing the F:C ratio also increased ruminal pH linearly and affected concentrations of butyrate and isovalerate quadratically. Increasing the F:C ratio from 47:53 to 68:32 increased CH₄ emission from 538 to 648g/cow per day, but had no effect on manure NH₃-N emission (14.1±3.9g/cow per day) and CO₂ emission (18,325±2,241g/cow per day). In this trial, CH₄ emission remained constant per unit of neutral detergent fiber intake (1g of CH₄ was emitted for every 10.3g of neutral detergent fiber consumed by the cow), but increased from 14.4 to 18.0g/kg of ECM when the percentage of forage in the diet increased from 47 to 68%. Although the pattern of emission within a day was distinct for each gas, emissions were higher between morning feeding (0930h) and afternoon milking (1600h) than later in the day. Altering the level of forage within a practical range and rebalancing dietary crude protein with common feeds of the Midwest of the United States had no effects on manure NH₃-N emission but altered CH₄ emission.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHolstein 3aair 3aair flow 3aalfalfa silage 3aammonia 3abarns 3abody weight 3abutyrates 3acarbon dioxide 3acattle feeds 3acorn silage 3acrude protein 3adairy cows 3adairy manure 3adietary protein 3aexcretion 3afermentation 3aforage 3agas emissions 3alactation 3alactose 3alipid content 3amethane 3amilk 3amilk fat 3amilk fat yield 3amilking 3aneutral detergent fiber 3apH 3atrue protein 2aAmmoniaxanalysis 2aAnimal Nutritional Physiological Phenomena 2aAnimals 2aCarbon Dioxidexanalysis 2aCattlexphysiology 2aDietxveterinary 2aFemale 2aLactationxphysiology 2aManurexanalysis 2aMethanexbiosynthesis 3aMidwestern United States1 aWattiaux, M.A.1 aPowell, J.M.1 aBroderick, G.A.1 aArndt, C.0 tJournal of dairy science.g2011 June, v. 94, no. 6 p.3081-3093dElsevier Inc.x0022-03027nnas40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/538703Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3168/jds.2010-40113Available from publisher's site  aARIS submissionbhttp://parking.nal.usda.gov/shortterm/111518_Effect_of_forage_to_concentrate_ratio_in_dairy_cow_diets_on_emission.pdf  aUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle02960naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002000152245009100172300001600263520170500279592002801984650002502012650002802037650001302065650002302078650001202101650001102113650001302124650001802137650001002155650001602165650000902181650001402190650001702204650001002221650001602231700002202247700001502269700002202284700002302306773009002329856008602419852000902505655001202514IND60095672120221118085409.0141104e20120615xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009567212DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfb.2012.02.0352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKarimi, Mahvash10aInvestigating wettability alteration during MEOR process, a micro/macro scale analysis  ap. 129-136.  aWettability alteration is considered to be one of the important mechanisms that lead to increased oil recovery during microbial enhanced oil recovery (MEOR) processes. Changes in wettability will greatly influence the petrophysical properties of the reservoir rocks and determine the location, flow and distribution of different fluids inside the porous media. Understanding the active mechanisms of surface wettability changes by the bacteria would help to optimize the condition for more oil recovery. As the mechanisms behind wettability alteration are still poorly understood, the objective of this study is to investigate the wettability alteration at pore scale and find the most effective mechanism of wettability changes in different cases. The experiments were performed on different substrates at fresh condition or aged in crude oil to mimic various wetting conditions. Using an Enterobacter cloacae strain, the influence of bacterial metabolites, bacterial adhesion and bacterial solution with two different carbon sources on wettability were determined for different aging periods. Contact angle measurements were used to quantify the wettability alteration of the solid surfaces. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) experiments were also utilized to combine the macroscopic measurements of wettability with the microscopic study of the surface changes. It was found that the surface wettability could vary from neutral- or oil-wet to water-wet state. Bacterial adhesion and biofilm formation seems to be the dominant mechanism of wettability alteration. The aged glass surfaces regained their initial water wetness where the bacteria could remove the polar and asphaltene compounds from them.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEnterobacter cloacae 3aatomic force microscopy 3abacteria 3abacterial adhesion 3abiofilm 3acarbon 3acolloids 3acontact angle 3aglass 3ametabolites 3aoils 3apetroleum 3aporous media 3arocks 3awettability1 aMahmoodi, Maziyar1 aNiazi, Ali1 aAl-Wahaibi, Yahya1 aAyatollahi, Shahab0 tColloids and surfaces.g2012 June 15, v. 95 p.129-136dElsevier B.V.x0927-77657nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfb.2012.02.0353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03028naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001700155245010800172300001600280520168600296592002801982650001402010650001002024650001602034650001102050650001502061650001102076650001602087650001502103650001602118653002902134653002102163653002402184653001802208653002502226653003402251700005802285700001602343700002602359773011002385856009002495852000902585655001202594IND60583027920221120214750.0200503e201711  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058302792DNAL7 a10.1016/j.landurbplan.2017.07.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDupont, Lien10aTesting the validity of a saliency-based method for visual assessment of constructions in the landscape  ap. 325-338.  aThis paper aims at evaluating a method for objective visual assessment of constructions in the landscape based on saliency, which is defined as the distinct perceptual quality by which an item in the world stands out from its surroundings and therefore attracts attention (conspicuity). Photographic simulations of public facility buildings, water towers and transmission towers inserted in a rural environment are created in different designs, colours and sizes. Their corresponding saliency maps, which are computationally generated predictions of the human viewing pattern, are calculated and compared with the saliency map of the original landscape photograph through a correlation analysis. Higher correlations indicate a smaller visual contrast from a landscape point of view of minimizing the visual disturbance. The method can also be used to generate eye-catching designs such as landmarks. The output of the saliency method is compared to human assessments of visual integration obtained using a photo-questionnaire. The results demonstrate that the saliency method is sensitive to differences in colour and size. In addition, the outcome is consistent with people’s subjective assessments. For design differences, this is less the case, probably because more factors than just the visual aspect are involved when choosing a design. The method could thus be useful when scenarios only differing in size and colour are to be compared. It is fast and easy which allows the assessment of many different scenarios and viewpoints. This could be valuable for designing more effective and all-round visual impact mitigation measures integrated in the design of a construction.  aPublisher supplied data 3abuildings 3acolor 3acorrelation 3ahumans 3alandscapes 3apeople 3aphotographs 3aprediction 3arural areas 0aPhotographic simulations 0aRural landscapes 0aPhoto-questionnaire 0aSaliency maps 0aCorrelation analysis 0aLandscape planning and design1 aOoms, Kristien1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4921-75531 aAntrop, M.,1 aEetvelde, Veerle van,0 tLandscape and urban planning.g2017 Nov., v. 167 p.325-338dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12405x0169-20467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.landurbplan.2017.07.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02798naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002500150245013100175300001400306520125100320592002801571650002501599650001601624650002101640650001701661650001201678650001301690650002301703650001501726650001801741650001201759650001401771650002201785650001601807650001401823650003301837650001401870653001401884653001401898653002501912653001901937653001201956653002101968653002501989700006202014773012202076856008502198852000902283655001202292IND60621748320221121135423.0190410e201812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062174832DNAL7 a10.1016/j.plaphy.2018.10.0262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGautam, Janesh Kumar10aAPD1, the unique member of Arabidopsis AP2 family influences systemic acquired resistance and ethylene-jasmonic acid signaling  ap. 92-99.  aArabidopsis AP2 FAMILY PROTEIN INVOLVED IN DISEASE DEFENSE (APD1) is a member of AP2/EREBP super-family that positively regulates SA biosynthesis and defense against virulent bacterial pathogens. Here we report additional roles of APD1 in plant defense and development. We show that APD1 function is required for light-mediated defense against bacterial pathogens and systemic acquired resistance (SAR). We demonstrate that APD1 function is not required for generating SAR mobile signal at the site of primary inoculation but is required at the distal end for SAR manifestation. In addition, the APD1 function is required for PTI-induced callose deposition, defense against necrotrophic pathogen Botrytis cinerea and Alternaria alternata, which are ethylene (ET) or ethylene-Jasmonate (JA) dependent responses. Development of seedling under dark and ET is partly dependent on APD1. The mutant apd1 plants are non-responsive towards exogenous ACC application regarding apical hook formation and hypocotyl shortening, however, possess WT-like ET-mediated root growth inhibition. JA-mediated root growth inhibition is also impaired in apd1 seedlings. Altogether our results suggest that APD1 impacts multiple aspects of plant growth and development.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAlternaria alternata 3aArabidopsis 3aBotrytis cinerea 3abiosynthesis 3acallose 3aethylene 3agrowth retardation 3ahypocotyls 3ajasmonic acid 3amutants 3apathogens 3aplant development 3aroot growth 3aseedlings 3asystemic acquired resistance 3avirulence 0aAt4g13040 0aAP2/EREBP 0aPseudomonas syringae 0aSalicylic acid 0aCallose 0aBotrytis cinerea 0aAlternaria alternata1 aNandi, Ashis Kumar1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5286-23290 tPlant physiology and biochemistry.g2018 Dec., v. 133 p.92-99dElsevier Masson SASwJournal:jnl41590x0981-94287nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.plaphy.2018.10.0263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02975naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245015200171500001400323520140900337592002801746650003301774650002601807650001301833650003001846650002901876650001101905650001901916650001301935650001401948650002201962650001901984650002602003650001402029650001702043650001402060650001302074650002102087700002002108700001802128700001902146700002202165700002102187700001802208700002102226773012802247856008502375852000902460655001202469IND60721696920221118055007.0201224e20201211xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072169692DNAL7 a10.3390/microorganisms81219642doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChang, Ya-Ting 10aCombination of Colistin and Azidothymidine Demonstrates Synergistic Activity against Colistin-Resistant, Carbapenem-Resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae  aNAL-light  aCarbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) is listed as an urgent threat by the World Health Organization because of the limited therapeutic options, rapid evolution of resistance mechanisms, and worldwide dissemination. Colistin is a common backbone agent among the “last-resort” antibiotics for CRE; however, its emerging resistance among CRE has taken the present dilemma to the next level. Azidothymidine (AZT), a thymidine analog used to treat human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, has been known to possess antibacterial effects against Enterobacteriaceae. In this study, we investigated the combined effects of AZT and colistin in 40 clinical isolates of colistin-resistant, carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae (CCRKP). Eleven of the 40 isolates harbored Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase. The in vitro checkerboard method and in vivo nematode killing assay both revealed synergistic activity between the two agents, with fractional inhibitory concentration indexes of ≤0.5 in every strain. Additionally, a significantly lower hazard ratio was observed for the nematodes treated with combination therapy (0.288; p < 0.0001) compared with either AZT or colistin treatment. Toxicity testing indicated potentially low toxicity of the combination therapy. Thus, the AZT–colistin combination could be a potentially favorable therapeutic option for treating CCRKP.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHuman immunodeficiency virus 3aKlebsiella pneumoniae 3aNematoda 3aWorld Health Organization 3aantibacterial properties 3aassays 3abeta-lactamase 3acolistin 3aevolution 3aimmunosuppression 3amicroorganisms 3aresistance mechanisms 3asynergism 3atherapeutics 3athymidine 3atoxicity 3atoxicity testing1 aYang, Zongying,1 aLu, Po-Liang 1 aLin, Shang-Yi 1 aWang, Liang-Chun 1 aWang, Sheng-Fan 1 aHsieh, Ya-Ju 1 aTseng, Sung-Pin 0 tMicroorganisms.g2020 Dec. 11, v. 8, no. 12dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27145x2076-26077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/microorganisms81219643Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02059naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001900139245013000158300002000288520085900308592002801167650001901195650001201214650001801226650002501244650001701269650002301286650001201309650001801321650001301339700002201352700002101374700001801395700002101413700002101434773013401455856007501589852000901664655001201673IND60538710120221121053013.0160815e20121107xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053871012DNAL7 a10.1021/ja307762b2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDecamps, Laure10aBiosynthesis of F0, Precursor of the F420 Cofactor, Requires a Unique Two Radical-SAM Domain Enzyme and Tyrosine as Substrate  ap. 18173-18176.  aCofactors play key roles in metabolic pathways. Among them F₄₂₀ has proved to be a very attractive target for the selective inhibition of archaea and actinobacteria. Its biosynthesis, in a unique manner, involves a key enzyme, F₀-synthase. This enzyme is a large monomer in actinobacteria, while it is constituted of two subunits in archaea and cyanobacteria. We report here the purification of both types of F₀-synthase and their in vitro activities. Our study allows us to establish that F₀-synthase, from both types, uses 5-amino-6-ribitylamino-2,4(1H,3H)-pyrimidinedione and tyrosine as substrates but not 4-hydroxylphenylpyruvate as previously suggested. Furthermore, our data support the fact that F₀-synthase generates two 5′-deoxyadenosyl radicals for catalysis which is unprecedented in reaction catalyzed by radical SAM enzymes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aActinobacteria 3aArchaea 3aCyanobacteria 3abiochemical pathways 3abiosynthesis 3acatalytic activity 3aenzymes 3afree radicals 3atyrosine1 aPhilmus, Benjamin1 aBenjdia, Alhosna1 aWhite, Robert1 aBegley, Tadhg P.1 aBerteau, Olivier0 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2012 Nov. 07, v. 134, no. 44 p.18173-18176dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fja307762b3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02724naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002200146245009400168300001600262500001900278520133900297592002801636650003401664650001501698650001701713650002001730650002401750650002001774650001601794650003501810650001301845651001501858653001601873653002101889653003101910653002401941700002301965700002401988700002402012700002202036773013102058856008002189852000902269655001202278IND60711546720221121090452.0200928e20200801xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071154672DNAL7 a10.2478/prolas-2020-00392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZatybekov, Alibek10aEffect of Population Size on Genome-Wide Association Study of Agronomic Traits in Soybean  ap. 244-251.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aSoybean is increasingly becoming one of the main oilseeds crops in Kazakhstan, with a major growing area in the south-eastern part of the country. The comparative assessment of small-size (108) and medium-size (276 accessions) collections of soybean originated from five regions of the world was made in field trials in Almaty region (south-east of Kazakhstan). The full collection was genotyped using the Illumina iSelect 6K SNP (single nucleotide polymorphism) array that allowed observation of 4651 polymorphic SNPs. The genome-wide association study (GWAS) was conducted using the following six important agronomic traits: flowering time, seed maturation time, plant height, number of fertile nodes, number of seeds per node, and thousand seed weight. In total, GWAS using TASSEL package identified 56 stable QTNs (quantitative trait nucleotdies) for all the studied traits, including 42 QTNs detected using the medium-size collection. It was shown that the medium-size population, in comparison with the small-size population, was preferable for the detection of significant associations. A comparative analysis of the data with previously published results suggested that 36 of the stable 56 QTNs were presumably novel associations. The revealed QTNs can be used in the molecular breeding projects for soybean yield improvement.  aPublisher supplied data 3agenome-wide association study 3agenotyping 3aplant height 3apopulation size 3aquantitative traits 3aseed maturation 3aseed weight 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 3asoybeans 3aKazakhstan 0aGlycine max 0ayield components 0aIlluminia genotyping array 0aassociation mapping1 aTuruspekov, Yerlan1 aDoszhanova, Botakoz1 aDidorenko, Svetlana1 aAbugalieva, Saule0 tProceedings of the Latvian Academy of Sciences.g2020 Aug. 01, v. 74, no. 4 p.244-251dSciendowJournal:21686x2255-890X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2478/prolas-2020-00393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03130naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001200150245009900162300001400261520187600275592002802151650002202179650001402201650002302215650001102238650002002249650001702269650000902286650001302295650001702308650001802325650001102343650000702354650001502361700001802376700001402394700001702408700001802425700003502443773009002478856008402568990002302652852000902675655001202684IND60092475920221119084205.0141103e20120117xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009247592DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cattod.2011.09.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSi, Rui10aStructure sensitivity of the low-temperature water-gas shift reaction on Cu–CeO₂ catalysts  ap. 68-80.  aWe have investigated the structure sensitivity of the water-gas shift (WGS) reaction on Cu–CeO₂ catalysts prepared at the nanoscale by different techniques. On the surface of ceria, different CuOₓ structures exist. We show here that only the strongly bound Cu–[Oₓ]–Ce species, probably associated with the surface oxygen vacancies of ceria, are active for catalyzing the low-temperature WGS reaction. Weakly bound CuOₓ clusters and CuO nanoparticles are spectator species in the reaction. Isolated Cu²⁺ ions doping the ceria surface are not active themselves, but they are important in that they create oxygen vacancies and can be used as a reservoir of copper to replenish surface Cu removed by leaching or sintering. Accordingly, synthesis techniques such as coprecipitation that allow for extensive solubility of Cu in ceria should be preferred over impregnation, deposition–precipitation, ion exchange or another two-step method whereby the copper precursor is added to already made ceria nanocrystals. For the synthesis of different structures, we have used two methods: a homogeneous coprecipitation (CP), involving hexamethylenetetramine as the precipitating agent and the pH buffer; and a deposition–precipitation (DP) technique. In the latter case, the ceria supports were first synthesized at the nanoscale with different shapes (rods, cubes) to investigate any potential shape effect on the reaction. Cu–CeO₂ catalysts with different copper contents up to ca. 20at.% were prepared. An indirect shape effect of CeO₂, manifested by the propensity to form oxygen vacancies and strongly bind copper in the active form, was established; i.e. the water-gas shift reaction is not structure-sensitive. The apparent activation energy of the reaction on all samples was similar, 50±10kJ/mol, in a product-free (2% CO–10% H₂O) gas mixture.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactivation energy 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3acopper 3acoprecipitation 3aion exchange 3aions 3aleaching 3ananocrystals 3ananoparticles 3aoxygen 3apH 3asolubility1 aRaitano, Joan1 aLee, Lan,1 aZhang, Lihua1 aChan, Siu-Wai1 aFlytzani-Stephanopoulos, Maria0 tCatalysis today.g2012 Jan. 17, v. 180, no. 1 p.68-80dElsevier B.V.x0920-58617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cattod.2011.09.0083Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02329naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001400152245007800166300001600244520103800260592002801298650001301326650001801339650001201357650000901369650001501378650001401393650001301407650001701420650003101437650001901468650001601487650001701503650001501520653001701535653001201552653000901564653001801573653001701591700001701608700001501625700001601640773010701656856008701763852000901850655001201859IND60536622020221116143551.0190409e201509  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053662202DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2015.04.1172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGil, M.V.10aGrindability and combustion behavior of coal and torrefied biomass blends  ap. 205-212.  aBiomass samples (pine, black poplar and chestnut woodchips) were torrefied to improve their grindability before being combusted in blends with coal. Torrefaction temperatures between 240 and 300°C and residence times between 11 and 43min were studied. The grindability of the torrefied biomass, evaluated from the particle size distribution of the ground sample, significantly improved compared to raw biomass. Higher temperatures increased the proportion of smaller-sized particles after grinding. Torrefied chestnut woodchips (280°C, 22min) showed the best grinding properties. This sample was blended with coal (5–55wt.% biomass). The addition of torrefied biomass to coal up to 15wt.% did not significantly increase the proportion of large-sized particles after grinding. No relevant differences in the burnout value were detected between the coal and coal/torrefied biomass blends due to the high reactivity of the coal. NO and SO2 emissions decreased as the percentage of torrefied biomass in the blend with coal increased.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCastanea 3aPopulus nigra 3abiomass 3acoal 3acombustion 3aemissions 3agrinding 3anitric oxide 3aparticle size distribution 3asulfur dioxide 3atemperature 3atorrefaction 3awood chips 0aTorrefaction 0aBiomass 0aCoal 0aCo-combustion 0aGrindability1 aGarcía, R.,1 aPevida, C.1 aRubiera, F.0 tBioresource technology.g2015 Sept., v. 191 p.205-212dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46263x0960-85247nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2015.04.1173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04079naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002500146245015700171300001600328500001900344520234200363592002802705650002502733650001602758650001702774650001302791650001102804650001602815650001402831650001902845650001902864650004002883650001702923650002802940650001302968650001702981650001302998650002003011650001803031650001803049653003103067653001103098653002303109653003103132700002003163700002503183700001903208700002603227700001903253700002103272773013103293856008003424852000903504655001203513IND60711546820221121090426.0200928e20200801xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071154682DNAL7 a10.2478/prolas-2020-00402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDruva-Lūsīte, Ieva10aPhysiological Performance of a Coastal Marsh Plant Hydrocotyle vulgaris in Natural Conditions in Relation to Mineral Nutrition and Mycorrhizal Symbiosis  ap. 252-262.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aFluctuating soil salinity and competition for light are the main factors affecting plant distribution and performance in coastal salt marshes. The aim of the present study was to assess plant performance by means of non-destructive instrumental methods in a highly heterogeneous natural habitat. More specifically, environmental factors affecting growth and physiological performance of a clonal plant Hydrocotyle vulgaris L. were investigated. Changes in soil salinity, soil mineral characteristics, leaf nutrient concentrations, morphological parameters, chlorophyll fluorescence, and mycorrhizal symbiosis were analysed in different experimental plots of naturally growing H. vulgaris plants. The dynamic nature of interaction between sea water flooding-affected changes in soil salinity and competition-dependent changes in light availability led to micro-environmental heterogeneity differentially affecting physiological performance and growth of H. vulgaris in natural conditions. Plant growth was mostly affected by intensity of photosynthetically active radiation in the respective plots. Increased growth rate in shaded conditions specifically pointed to shade tolerance strategy of H. vulgaris. High heterogeneity of mineral nutrients between the plots was established. However, considerable plasticity of metabolism in respect to highly variable soil concentration of mineral nutrients together with effective mineral adaptation mechanisms ensured optimal supply of material for growth. Photochemistry of photosynthesis was only marginally affected by differences in microenvironmental conditions as shown by respective changes in chlorophyll a fluorescence parameters. Mycorrhizal symbiosis was stimulated by moderately increasing soil salinity and suppressed by relatively high salinity. When the effect of soil salinity was omitted, intensity of mycorrhizal symbiosis was positively associated with intensity of photo-synthetically active radiation. In general, a relatively high stable level of photosynthetic performance across a wide range of micro-environmental conditions indicates an adequate level of physiological adaptation of H. vulgaris to conditions of a coastal salt marsh. The present data clearly reflect complex interactions between environmental factors and plastic physiological responses of H. vulgaris.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHydrocotyle vulgaris 3achlorophyll 3afluorescence 3ahabitats 3aleaves 3amycorrhizae 3anutrition 3aphotochemistry 3aphotosynthesis 3aphotosynthetically active radiation 3aplant growth 3apopulation distribution 3asalinity 3asalt marshes 3aseawater 3ashade tolerance 3asoil minerals 3asoil salinity 0achlorophyll a fluorescence 0agrowth 0anatural conditions 0aphotosynthetic performance1 aKarlsons, Andis1 aAndersone-Ozola, Una1 aIeviņa, Baiba1 aNečajeva, Jevgeņija1 aSamsone, Ineta1 aIevinsh, Gederts0 tProceedings of the Latvian Academy of Sciences.g2020 Aug. 01, v. 74, no. 4 p.252-262dSciendowJournal:21686x2255-890X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2478/prolas-2020-00403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01706naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245008900169300001400258500001100272520063600283592002800919650002500947650001900972650001000991650001201001650002001013650002301033650001601056650001801072700001801090700002001108773013701128856008201265852000901347655001201356IND60590269820221121020550.0180619e201801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059026982DNAL7 a10.1134/S106236041801006X2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTishevskaya, N.V.10aEffect of lymphocyte morphogenetic activity on organism reactivity and resistibility  ap. 48-59.  aReview  aIn addition to their role in physiological and reparative regeneration of tissues, lymphoid cells are involved in the implementation of protective and adaptive reactions not related to immune response.

The Dystric Ustochrepts (Velem) soil formed on metamorphic schist parent material and had forest vegetation, while the Typic Medisaprists (Zalavár) soil developed on peat parent material and had marsh vegetation. Based on this study the spatial variability of surface pH samples indicate that the TIM sampling procedure should be improved. Ten to thirty samples must be collected at each site to be able to monitor changes of 0.2 pH units. If only one sample is taken at each site yearly, spatial difference in pH or other parameters are likely to obscure differences which may be occurring over time. The colloidal composition (organic matter and clay minerals), influenced by parent material, vegetation, and precipitation, showed a close relationship with the acidity factors, such as pH, HAC ₁ and EAC ₁ values. The pH values were the lowest in the Velem and Oltárc soils where the annual precipitation was the highest (750-800 mm), and in the Karád soil, where the annual precipitation was 650-700 mm. The Gödöllő soil had the highest pH values, probably due to the lowest amount of rainfall (550-600 mm) and the disturbance. The Zalavár soil had fairly high pH throughout the profile probably due to a fluctuating water table. The HAC ₁ and EAC ₁ values were the highest in the Velem soil when compared to the other mineral soils. The pH values were the lowest at this site. The HAC ₁ and EAC ₁ values were lower in the other three forest soils, at the Karád, Oltárc, and Gödöllő sites. The Zalavár soil had fairly high HAC ₁ values in the H3, H4 and H5 horizons, probably due to the very high OM content, which provided a lot of H ⁺ ions that can dissociate from the exchange sites. The E4/E6 ratios were closely related to the decomposition or humification rate in the upper and the subsurface horizons with accumulation of low molecular weight soluble fraction in the deeper horizon. The mineralogical analysis showed similar compositions for the soils developed on loess (Karád and Oltárc), or aeolian sand (Gödöllő), where the major minerals were vermiculite, mica, kaolinite, and chlorite. A different mineral composition (mica, vermiculite, clintonite, and kaolinite) was observed for the Velem site, where the parent material was metamorphic schist. The four mineral soils are forest soils, with a predominant downward water movement, thus with fairly intensive leaching process. However, there was a distinct difference among the soils formed on loess (Karád and Oltárc), or aeolian sand (Gödöllő), and the soil (Velem) developed on metamorphic schist parent material. The soils at the Karád, Oltárc, and the Gödöllő sites were less acidified, with higher pH, and lower HAC ₁ , and EAC ₁ values as compared to the Velem soil, even if the precipitation was very high. The calcareous loess parent material probably compensated for the higher precipitation and the resulting leaching process at the Karád and the Oltárc sites. The Gödöllő soil received a very low amount of precipitation, which resulted in a low degree of weathering, with higher pH, and lower HAC ₁ , and EAC ₁ values. However, the metamorphic schist parent material probably contributed to a lower pH and lower buffering of the developing soil. Based on the chemical and physical analyses, we concluded that among the soil forming factors, precipitation and parent material had the greatest influence on the acidity characteristics of the examined soils. The parent material influenced the mineralogy of the developing soil, which then influenced the pH, HAC ₁ , EAC ₁ , and CEC values of the soil. In order to substantiate these tendencies more samples from a wider array of geological regions are needed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHaplustalfs 3aacidity 3aclay 3aeolian sands 3aforests 3ahumification 3akaolinite 3aloess 3amarshes 3amica 3amineral content 3amolecular weight 3aorganic matter 3apeat 3arain 3asoil pH 3avermiculite 3awater table 3aHungary 0acation exchange capacity1 aMichéli, E.1 avan Scoyoc, G.

CH4 is responsible for approximately 20% of the Earth's warming since pre-industrial times. Knowledge of the sources of CH4 is crucial due to the recent substantial interannual variability of growth rates and uncertainties regarding individual sources. The prevailing paradigm is that methanogenesis carried out by methanogenic archaea occurs primarily under strictly anaerobic conditions. However, in the past decade, studies have confirmed direct CH4 release from three important kingdoms of eukaryotes—Plantae, Animalia and Fungi—even in the presence of oxygen. This novel CH4 production pathway has been aptly termed “aerobic CH4 production” to distinguish it from the well-known anaerobic CH4 production pathway, which involves catalytic activity by methanogenic archaeal enzymes. In this review, we collated recent experimental evidence from the published literature and documented this novel pathway of direct CH4 production and emission by eukaryotes. The mechanisms involved in this pathway may be related to protective strategies of eukaryotes in response to changing environmental stresses, with CH4 a by-product or end-product during or at the end of the process(es) that originates from organic methyl-type compounds. Based on the existing, albeit uncertain estimates, plants seem to contribute less to the global CH4 budget (3–24%) compared to previous estimates (10–37%). We still lack estimates of CH4 emissions by animals and fungi. Overall, there is an urgent need to identify the precursors for this novel CH4 source and improve our understanding of the mechanisms of direct CH4 production and the impacts of environmental stresses. An estimate of this new CH4 source, which was not considered as a CH4 source by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) (2013), could be useful for better quantitation of the global CH4 budget.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAnimalia 3aArchaea 3aanaerobic conditions 3aanimals 3aatmospheric chemistry 3abyproducts 3acarbon dioxide 3acatalytic activity 3aenvironmental impact 3aenzymes 3aeukaryotic cells 3afungi 3aglobal warming 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3agreenhouse gases 3amethane 3amethane production 3amethanogens 3aoxygen 3aplants (botany) 3auncertainty 0aGreenhouse gas 0aReactive oxygen species 0aMethane budget 0aClimate change1 aChen, Huai1 aZhu, Qiuan1 aShen, Yan1 aWang, Xue1 aWang, Meng1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5291-56221 aPeng, Changhui0 tAtmospheric environment.g2015 Aug., v. 115 p.26-35dElsevier Ltdx1352-23107nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.atmosenv.2015.05.0193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02938naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002300151245015800174500001400332520139700346592002801743650001801771650001901789650001301808650002401821650001601845650001001861650004201871650001601913650001301929650003101942650001501973650000701988650002201995651001502017700002702032700002402059700002502083700002502108700002502133700002602158700002602184700002402210773012802234856008502362852000902447655001202456IND60721697220221123035821.0201224e20201211xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072169722DNAL7 a10.3390/microorganisms81219672doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNazina, Tamara  N.10aSoehngenia longivitae sp. nov., a Fermenting Bacterium Isolated from a Petroleum Reservoir in Azerbaijan, and Emended Description of the Genus Soehngenia  aNAL-light  aA methanogenic enrichment growing on a medium with methanol was obtained from a petroleum reservoir (Republic of Azerbaijan) and stored for 33 years without transfers to fresh medium. High-throughput sequencing of the V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene revealed members of the genera Desulfovibrio, Soehngenia, Thermovirga, Petrimonas, Methanosarcina, and Methanomethylovorans. A novel gram-positive, rod-shaped, anaerobic fermentative bacterium, strain 1933Pᵀ, was isolated from this enrichment and characterized. The strain grew at 13–55 °C (optimum 35 °C), with 0–3.0% (w/v) NaCl (optimum 0–2.0%) and in the pH range of 6.7–8.0 (optimum pH 7.0). The 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity, the average nucleotide identity (ANI) and in silico DNA–DNA hybridization (dDDH) values between strain 1933Pᵀ and the type strain of the most closely related species Soehngenia saccharolytica DSM 12858ᵀ were 98.5%, 70.5%, and 22.6%, respectively, and were below the threshold accepted for species demarcation. Genome-based phylogenomic analysis and physiological and biochemical characterization of the strain 1933Pᵀ (VKM B-3382ᵀ = KCTC 15984ᵀ) confirmed its affiliation to a novel species of the genus Soehngenia, for which the name Soehngenia longivitae sp. nov. is proposed. Genome analysis suggests that the new strain has potential in the degradation of proteinaceous components.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDesulfovibrio 3aMethanosarcina 3abacteria 3acomputer simulation 3adegradation 3agenes 3ahigh-throughput nucleotide sequencing 3amethanogens 3amethanol 3anucleic acid hybridization 3aoil fields 3apH 3asequence homology 3aAzerbaijan1 aBidzhieva, Salimat  K.1 aGrouzdev, Denis  S.1 aSokolova, Diyana  S.1 aTourova, Tatyana  P.1 aParshina, Sofiya  N.1 aAvtukh, Alexander  N.1 aPoltaraus, Andrey  B.1 aTalybly, Azhdar  K.0 tMicroorganisms.g2020 Dec. 11, v. 8, no. 12dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27145x2076-26077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/microorganisms81219673Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01918naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245006700169300001600236520089300252592002801145650001401173650001501187650001701202650001101219650002301230650001201253650001401265700003001279700002101309700002001330700002001350773010801370856008101478852000901559655001201568IND60573805720221117235248.0170725e201701  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057380572DNAL7 a10.1007/s00436-016-5275-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFranken, Gabriele10aMalaria relapses were already known before 1900—a discussion  ap. 185-189.  aFor a long time, only two phases of the life cycle of the agents of malaria parasites were known: the cycle inside the mosquito body and the cycle in the red blood cells of humans as intermediate hosts. A possible tissue development cycle inside humans, however, had already been proposed before 1900. In general, Pieter Klaesz Pel is considered the first scientist who has described such a tissue cycle. However, a closer look at Pel’s work shows that he still followed an old (conservative) way of thinking, since he still referred to “malaria poison and malaria miasma.” Thus, the first idea of a possible tissue cycle must be searched in the work of earlier scientists. Referring to their observations on malaria, Vassilij Danilevsky, Arman Ruffer, Camillo Golgi and Battista Grassi suspected developing parasites in internal organs, before they can be found in the bloodstream.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCulicidae 3ablood flow 3aerythrocytes 3ahumans 3aintermediate hosts 3amalaria 3aparasites1 aBruijns-Pötschke, Marita1 aRichter, Joachim1 aMehlhorn, Heinz1 aLabisch, Alfons0 tParasitology research.g2017 Jan., v. 116, no. 1 p.185-189dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx0932-01137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00436-016-5275-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01705naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002500092040001800117100002400135245006600159300001600225500002000241520067600261592002800937650001500965650000900980650002000989650002201009650003201031650001701063651001801080700002401098700002101122773014301143852000901286856007201295655001201367IND2201626920221121150300.0200105e199902  iau|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220162692DNAL7 a10.2307/12444572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHurley, Terrance M.14aThe Structure of Wages and Benefits in the U.S. Pork Industry  ap. 144-163.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aPork production has evolved from relatively small, family‐run operations toward large‐scale operations with several employees. Important questions about the structure of compensation in this rapidly changing labor market are answered using probit and ordered probit models and data from a national survey of pork producers and their employees. The results suggest (i) the structure of wages in pork production is consistent with more developed labor markets; (ii) employees earn a wage premium for using advanced technology and working in larger operations; and (iii) employees are willing to accept lower wages in exchange for better benefits and working conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3awage rates 3apork 3aprobit analysis 3acosts and returns 3alivestock and meat industry 3alabor market 3aUnited States1 aKliebenstein, James1 aOrazem, Peter F.0 tAmerican journal of agricultural economics.g1999 Feb., v. 81, no. 1 p.144-163dOxford University PresswJournal:jnl44932x0002-90927nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2307/12444573Available from publisher's site 7aarticle02374naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002000144245012400164300002000288520089200308592002801200650001301228650001201241650002101253650000901274650001401283650001901297650001301316650001301329650001301342653001001355653001901365653002601384653002101410653002601431700001801457700002001475700001901495700001501514700001601529700001601545700001801561700001601579700005601595773014201651856007801793852000901871655001201880IND60709094620221120033524.0200902e20200622xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070909462DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.0c075772doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHong, Changhyun10aComprehensive Study of the Growth Mechanism and Photoelectrochemical Activity of a BiVO₄/Bi₂S₃ Nanowire Composite  ap. 39713-39719.  aA BiVO₄/Bi₂S₃ composite comprising Bi₂S₃ nanowires on top of a BiVO₄ film was prepared via hydrothermal reaction. Because additional Bi³⁺ ions were not delivered during the reaction, BiVO₄ served as the Bi³⁺ ion source for the development of Bi₂S₃. A detailed growth mechanism of the nanowire was elucidated by an analysis of the concentration gradient of Bi³⁺ and S²– ions during the reaction. The in situ growth was followed by the etching of BiVO₄ to Bi³⁺ and VO₄³– ions and regrowth to Bi₂S₃, which resulted in the rapid evolution of nanowires on the BiVO₄ substrate. The fabricated BiVO₄/Bi₂S₃NW composite exhibited an improved photoelectrochemical activity compared to other Bi₂S₃ samples. The improved efficiency was mainly attributed to both improved charge separation and effective adhesion obtained by the in situ growth.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadhesion 3abismuth 3aelectrochemistry 3aions 3ananowires 3aphotochemistry 3aregrowth 3asulfides 3avanadium 0aBiVO4 0aBi2S3 nanowire 0aBiVO4/Bi2S3 composite 0agrowth mechanism 0aphotoelectrochemistry1 aKim, Yong-il,1 aSeo, Jong Hyeok1 aKim, Ji-Hyeon,1 aMa, Ahyeon1 aLim, Yun Ji1 aSeo, Dongho1 aBaek, So Yeon1 aJung, Haeun1 aNam, Ki-min,1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1718-58760 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2020 June 22, v. 12, no. 35 p.39713-39719dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.0c075773Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02852naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100002100137245007000158300001600228520136300244592002801607650004401635650001201679650001201691650002901703650000901732650001501741650002001756650002501776650001301801650001301814650002301827650002401850650001601874651001101890653003301901653001701934653001901951653001901970653003001989653002102019653002402040700002102064700001902085700002102104700002602125773010202151856007202253852000902325655001202334IND60766675920221116222543.0220209s2022    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076667592DNAL7 a10.1071/SR193962doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPressler, Yamina10aContinental-scale measurements of soil pyrogenic carbon in Europe  ap. 103-113.  aPyrogenic carbon (PyC), the product of incomplete biomass combustion, is a key component of soil organic carbon (SOC) because it can persist in soils for centuries to millennia. Quantifying PyC across large spatial scales remains a significant challenge in constraining the global carbon cycle. We measured PyC in topsoils across Europe using molecular marker (benzene polycarboxylic acids, BPCA) and spectroscopic techniques (Diffuse Reflectance Infrared Fourier Transform Spectroscopy, DRIFTS). We developed a calibration between BPCA and DRIFTS, but the calibration was less reliable (Y -variance explained=0.62) than previous reports due to low soil PyC content and heterogeneity of soil matrices. Thus, we performed multiple regressions to identify drivers of PyC distribution using only the measured BPCA data. PyC content varied widely among soils, contributing 0&#x2013;24% of SOC. Organic carbon was the strongest predictor of soil PyC content, but mean annual temperature, clay, and cation exchange capacity also emerged as predictors. PyC contributes a smaller proportion of SOC in European soils compared to other geographic regions. Comparing soil PyC measurements to PyC production rates in high latitude and Mediterranean regions suggests that transport, degradation, and recombustion are important mechanisms regulating soil PyC accumulation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3abenzene 3abiomass 3acation exchange capacity 3aclay 3acombustion 3agenetic markers 3aglobal carbon budget 3alatitude 3aresearch 3asoil heterogeneity 3asoil organic carbon 3atemperature 3aEurope 0abenzene polycarboxylic acids 0ablack carbon 0acarbon cycling 0aEuropean soils 0amid-infrared spectroscopy 0apyrogenic carbon 0asoil organic matter1 aBoot, Claudia M.1 aAbiven, Samuel1 aLugato, Emanuele1 aFrancesca Cotrufo, M.0 tSoil research.g2022, v. 60, no. 2 p.103-113dCSIRO PublishingwJournal:jnl44751x1838-675X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1071/SR193963Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02589naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100006300152245009300215300001600308520099500324592002801319650000801347650001201355650001901367650002001386650001401406650001301420650001301433650001101446650001501457650001701472650001701489650001801506650001301524650001101537650001901548650001201567650001801579650001601597653002001613653001801633653001301651653002201664653001101686700006001697700002501757700007401782773010701856856008701963852000902050655001202059IND60621745920221117110910.0190410e201812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062174592DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biombioe.2018.10.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMonir, Minhaj Uddin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3968-541X10aGasification of lignocellulosic biomass to produce syngas in a 50 kW downdraft reactor  ap. 335-345.  aLignocellulosic biomass gasification shows a pronounced prospective to replace fossil fuels. In this study, the gasification of coconut shell with charcoal using a 50 kW downdraft reactor was investigated. The controlling parameter of temperature and pressure were used to verify the production of gas during the gasification process with air. The higher contents of cellulose and hemicellulose than lignin in the sample were found to gasify better, as evident from structural analysis. The gasifier produces a combustible gas with a H2, CO, CO2 and CH4 concentrations of 8.44, 15.38, 5.38 and 1.62 mol.% respectively, at a total flow of air of 30 m3 h−1. The results revealed that 30 wt% charcoal in the feedstock was effectively gasified to generate syngas comprising over 30 mol.% of syngas with a lower heating value of 3.27 MJ/Nm3. Thus, the co-gasification of lignocellulosic biomass with charcoal may contribute to affordable and environmentally friendly syngas energy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3abiomass 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbon monoxide 3acellulose 3acharcoal 3acoconuts 3aenergy 3afeedstocks 3afossil fuels 3agasification 3ahemicellulose 3ahydrogen 3alignin 3alignocellulose 3amethane 3asynthesis gas 3atemperature 0aCo-gasification 0aCoconut shell 0aCharcoal 0aDowndraft reactor 0aSyngas1 aAbd Aziz, Azrina1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2856-64631 aKristanti, Risky Ayu1 aAbdullah, Abu Yousuf Mohammad,1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4105-39370 tBiomass and bioenergy.g2018 Dec., v. 119 p.335-345dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl3929140x0961-95347nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biombioe.2018.10.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02819naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004100092040001800133100001800151245017600169300001600345520129100361592002801652650001301680650002501693650001701718650002501735650001101760650001301771650002001784650001301804650003601817650002101853650000701874650001501881650001701896650001701913650001801930650001001948650002501958700001201983700001801995700001902013700002502032700001502057700001402072700001902086773011202105856008702217852000902304655001202313IND4467615320221119080603.0141110e201102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446761532DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envexpbot.2010.09.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAli, Shafaqat14aThe ecotoxicological and interactive effects of chromium and aluminum on growth, oxidative damage and antioxidant enzymes on two barley genotypes differing in Al tolerance  ap. 185-191.  aThe effects of single or combined stress of aluminum (Al) and chromium (Cr) on plant growth, root dehydrogenase, oxidative stress and antioxidative enzymes were studied using two barley genotypes differing in Al tolerance in a hydroponic experiment.

Under Al or Cr stress, the activities of antioxidative enzymes, including superoxide dismutase (SOD), peroxidase (POD), ascorbate peroxidase (APX), glutathione reductase (GR) and catalase (CAT), were dramatically increased in plant tissues. Gebeina, an Al-tolerant genotype, had less oxidative damage than Shang 70-119, an Al-sensitive genotype. The extent of oxidative damage induced by Cr varied with the pH of the culture solution, with lower pH values (4.0) being more severe than higher pH values (6.5). The combination of Cr and Al caused a further decrease in plant growth, a decrease in root dehydrogenase activity and an increase in MDA and H₂O₂ contents as well as the activities of antioxidative enzymes. There was also a marked difference between the two barley genotypes in the extent of increased antioxidative enzyme activity under the Cr and Al stresses.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaluminum 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3aascorbate peroxidase 3abarley 3achromium 3aenzyme activity 3agenotype 3aglutathione-disulfide reductase 3aoxidative stress 3apH 3aperoxidase 3aplant growth 3aplant stress 3aplant tissues 3aroots 3asuperoxide dismutase1 aBai, Pu1 aZeng, Fanrong1 aCai, Shengguan1 aShamsi, Imran Haider1 aQiu, Boyin1 aWu, Feibo1 aZhang, Guoping0 tEnvironmental and experimental botany.g2011 Feb., v. 70, no. 2-3 p.185-191dElsevier B.V.x0098-84727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envexpbot.2010.09.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02398naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002400152245011000176300001600286520108500302592002801387650001501415650001401430650002501444650001301469650001301482650001301495650001201508650002101520650001001541650001701551650001101568650000701579650001701586650002101603650002001624700004001644700003001684700003101714700002201745773009001767856008601857852000901943655001201952IND60095669420221118084831.0141104e20120615xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009566942DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfb.2012.02.0452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMartinez, María J.10aInterfacial and foaming interactions between casein glycomacropeptide (CMP) and propylene glycol alginate  ap. 214-221.  aProteins and polysaccharides are widely used in food formulation. While most of the proteins are surface active, only few polysaccharides can adsorb at the air–water interface; this is the case of propylene glycol alginates (PGA). It is known that casein glycomacropeptide (CMP), a bioactive polypeptide derived from κ-casein by the action of chymosin, presents a great foaming capacity but provides unstable foams. So, the objective of this work was to analyze the impact of mixing CMP and a commercial variety of PGA, Kelcoloid O (KO), on the interfacial and foaming properties at pH 7.0. It was determined the surface pressure isotherm, the dynamics of adsorption and the foaming properties for CMP, KO and the mixed system CMP–KO. CMP dominated the surface pressure of CMP–KO mixed system. The presence of KO synergistically improved the viscoelastic properties of surface film. The foaming capacity of CMP was altered by KO. KO foam presented a higher stability than CMP foam and it controlled the stability against drainage and the initial collapse in the mixed foam.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3aalginates 3abioactive properties 3achymosin 3acolloids 3adrainage 3afoaming 3afoaming capacity 3afoams 3akappa-casein 3amixing 3apH 3apolypeptides 3apropylene glycol 3aviscoelasticity1 aPizones Ruiz-Henestrosa, Víctor M.1 aCarrera Sánchez, Cecilio1 aRodríguez Patino, Juan M.1 aPilosof, Ana M.R.0 tColloids and surfaces.g2012 June 15, v. 95 p.214-221dElsevier B.V.x0927-77657nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfb.2012.02.0453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02743naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002700111040001800138100001500156245010800171300001800279520099700297592002801294650001601322650001201338650002201350650001301372650001901385650003101404650001301435650001501448650001101463650002001474650002601494650002501520650001401545650002001559650001801579650002401597650002101621650003901642650002401681651001001705653001101715653001901726653001201745653001901757653001201776653001601788700001601804700001801820700001601838700001901854700002001873700001901893773013301912852000902045856007502054655001202129IND4470222320221118005758.0160905e20130703xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447022232DNAL7 a237568532pmid7 a10.1021/jf400943h2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Wenhao10aPhysicochemical Properties of A- and B-Starch Granules Isolated from Hard Red and Soft Red Winter Wheat  ap. 6477-6484.  aLarge A- and small B-starch granules separated from hard red and soft red winter wheat grains were investigated for their morphological, structural, and physicochemical properties. A-granules displayed a disk or lenticular shape, and B-granules showed a spherical or polygonal shape according to SEM. XRD analysis showed that both A- and B-granules had A-type crystallinity. A-granules contained a higher amount of amylose and a lower protein content and amylopectin/amylose ratio than B-granules. A-type granules exhibited a higher hydrolysis extent and swelling power and a lower iodine affinity than did B-granules. A-granules showed a higher peak, trough, breakdown and final viscosity, and gelatinization enthalpy than did B-granules, while B-granules exhibited a higher gelatinization temperature. The study demonstrated that the A- and B-granules separated from both hard red and soft red winter wheat grains exhibited a similar structure and very different physicochemical properties.  aPublisher supplied data 3aamylopectin 3aamylose 3acrystal structure 3aenthalpy 3agelatinization 3agelatinization temperature 3agranules 3ahydrolysis 3aiodine 3aprotein content 3asoft red winter wheat 3aswelling (materials) 3aviscosity 2aFlourxanalysis 2aParticle Size 2aChemical Phenomena. 2aSeedsxchemistry 2aStarchxchemistryxultrastructure. 2aTriticumxchemistry 0aChina 0astarch 0aswelling power 0apasting 0agelatinization 0aamylose 0aamylopectin1 aShan, Yulin1 aXiao, Xinlong1 aLuo, Qingui1 aZheng, Jianmei1 aOuyang, Shaohui1 aZhang, Guoquan0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2013 July 03, v. 61, no. 26 p.6477-6484dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-51187nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fjf400943h3Available from publisher's site 7aarticle02191naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001700146245008700163300002000250520111200270592002801382650002301410650002401433650001101457650002501468650001401493650002301507650002001530650001501550650001601565700002301581700001701604773012901621856008201750852000901832655001201841IND60566989220180615000000.0170417e20161006xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056698922DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.6b067072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMaras, Emile10aStability Diagram of Janus and Core–Shell Configurations in Bimetallic Nanowires  ap. 22670-22680.  aAlloy nanoparticles can exhibit several different structures due to segregation and phase separation. In the case of an alloy with a tendency to phase separate, the core–shell (CS) configuration and the so-called “Janus” one are the most commonly observed configurations. For a given alloy, the relative stability of these configurations depends on the size of the particle, the temperature, and the chemical composition. Using canonical Monte Carlo simulation on a rigid lattice, we study the stability diagram of bimetallic nanowires and its evolution as a function of the length of nanowires. We consider successively alloys with a weak and strong superficial segregation tendency. The simplicity of this 1D system allows us to extract the pertinent energetic parameters that control the relative stabilities. Furthermore, we find that the critical temperature decreases when increasing the size of the system. Phase diagrams and stability diagrams are compared and discussed in terms of the behavior of an assembly in mutual equilibrium with each other or of an assembly of isolated nanoparticles.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMonte Carlo method 3aalloy nanoparticles 3aalloys 3achemical composition 3ananowires 3aphysical chemistry 3aphysical phases 3aseparation 3atemperature1 aBerthier, Fabienne1 aLegrand, B.,0 tThe Journal of Physical Chemistry C.g2016 Oct. 06, v. 120, no. 39 p.22670-22680dAmerican Chemical Societyx1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.jpcc.6b067073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02974naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245010300165300001400268500001100282520147700293592002801770650001801798650002501816650002701841650002001868650001001888650001301898650001301911650001101924650001801935650001601953650002301969650001901992650001202011650001302023650003002036650001402066651002002080651001002100651001002110651002002120651002302140700001902163700002102182700002302203700002202226773010602248856008102354852000902435655001202444IND60573803020221117235247.0170725e201701  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057380302DNAL7 a10.1007/s00436-016-5278-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAhmad, Rumana10aNeurocysticercosis: a review on status in India, management, and current therapeutic interventions  ap. 21-33.  aReview  aTapeworms (cestodes) are segmented flatworms responsible for causing diseases that may prove fatal and difficult to treat in the absence of proper treatment and efficient drugs. Neurocysticercosis (NCC) is a common parasitic infection of the central nervous system and a major contributor to epilepsy caused by the metacestode (larva) of the human tapeworm Taenia solium, characterized by a range of pathological symptoms including epileptic seizures, headaches, and hydrocephalus. Cysticercosis is considered as a “biological imprint” of the socioeconomic development of a community in general and a country in particular. It is the single most common cause of epilepsy in the resource-poor endemic regions of the world, including most of South and Central America, India, Southeast Asia, China, and sub-Saharan Africa. A vast degree of variation in the neuropathology and clinical symptoms of NCC often makes it difficult to diagnose and manage. To add to it, emerging drug resistance to known anti-parasitic agents, together with the inability of these agents to prevent re-infection and relapse, further complicates the disease scenario. The aim of the current review was to provide the latest update on NCC with special emphasis on the Indian scenario, along with current and novel methods of diagnosis as well as scope of development for novel detection techniques, novel targets for drug development, and therapeutic interventions, as well as future challenges.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTaenia solium 3aantiparasitic agents 3acentral nervous system 3adrug resistance 3adrugs 3aepilepsy 3aheadache 3ahumans 3ahydrocephalus 3amethodology 3aneurocysticercosis 3aneuropathology 3arelapse 3aseizures 3asocioeconomic development 3atapeworms 3aCentral America 3aChina 3aIndia 3aSouth East Asia 3aSub-Saharan Africa1 aKhan, Tahmeena1 aAḥmad, Bilāl,1 aMiśra, Aparṇā,1 aBalapure, Anil K.0 tParasitology research.g2017 Jan., v. 116, no. 1 p.21-33dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx0932-01137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00436-016-5278-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02895naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100001800137245009000155300001600245520158000261592002801841650001101869650001901880650001501899650002801914650000701942650001301949650001301962650002401975650002801999650001002027651001602037653002302053653006002076653003902136653002102175653001202196653002102208700002002229700001702249773010202266856007202368852000902440655001202449IND60766676120221116221917.0220209s2021    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076667612DNAL7 a10.1071/SR203132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLambie, S. M.10aPriming of carbon decomposition in 27 dairy grazed soils after bovine urine additions  ap. 124-136.  aContext Soil organic matter (SOM) plays a vital role in carbon (C) storage and agricultural sustainability. Additions of bovine urine to soils can cause positive priming of soil C decomposition and represents a pathway for SOM loss. However, data is limited to a few soils. Aims We investigated the priming response to bovine urine of 27 dairy grazed pasture soils from the North Island of New Zealand. Methods Soils from Allophanic, Gley, Recent and Brown soil orders were collected. 14 C-labelled dairy cow urine was applied (1000kgNha&#x2212;1) to undisturbed soil cores and carbon dioxide (CO2) fluxes measured (25&#xb0;C) for 21days. Urine applications were repeated, and CO2 measured for a further 21days (25&#xb0;C). Water was the control treatment. Key results CO2 fluxes rapidly increased after both urine additions by 86&#xb1;1% 24h after the first urine addition, and 68&#xb1;4% after the second. Positive, negative and no priming were observed, and the mean absolute deviation of priming ranged between 200 and 1000&#x3bc;gCg&#x2212;1 , and variability was greater after the second urine addition. Urine induced changes in pH and electrical conductivity (EC) had no effect on priming, and soil C contents were correlated to cumulative CO2 , but not priming, and varied over time. Conclusions Factors affecting soil priming remain elusive and priming was highly variable within and between soil types. Implications The impacts of bovine urine on C pools requires further investigation to determine if, or when, urine patches are potential pathways for soil C loss.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3acarbon dioxide 3adairy cows 3aelectrical conductivity 3apH 3apastures 3aresearch 3asoil organic matter 3asustainable agriculture 3aurine 3aNew Zealand 0abuffering capacity 0acumulative urine effect on soil electrical conductivity 0acumulative urine effect on soil pH 0anegative priming 0apasture 0apositive priming1 aMason, N.

Different approaches have been applied to target the isolation of new bioactive metabolites from plant extracts. In this study, bioactive natural products were isolated from the crude organic extract of the mangrove plant Avicennia lanata collected from the east coast of Peninsular Malaysia in the Setiu Wetlands, Terengganu, using HRESI-LCMS-based metabolomics-guided isolation and fractionation. Isolation work on the crude extract A. lanata used high-throughput chromatographic techniques to give two new naphthofuranquinone derivatives, hydroxyavicenol C (1) and glycosemiquinone (2), along with the known compounds avicenol C (3), avicequinone C (4), glycoquinone (5), taraxerone (6), taraxerol (7), β-sitosterol (8) and stigmasterol (9). The elucidation and identification of the targeted bioactive compounds used 1D and 2D-NMR and mass spectrometry.

Current treatment is surgery followed by radiation and intravenous chemotherapy. However, drawbacks for current chemotherapeutics lie in the fact that they develop resistance and do not achieve therapeutic concentrations in the lymphatic system. We hypothesize that a three-drug nanoscale drug delivery system, tailored for lymphatic uptake, administered subcutaneously, will have decreased drug resistance and therefore offer better therapeutic outcomes. We prepared and characterized nanoparticles (NPs) with docetaxel, everolimus, and LY294002 in polyethyleneglycol-block-poly(ε-caprolactone) (PEG–PCL) polymer with different charge distributions by modifying the ratio of anionic and neutral end groups on the PEG block. These NPs are similarly sized (~48nm), with neutral, partially charged, or fully charged surface. The NPs are able to load ~2mg/mL of each drug and are stable for 24h. The NPs are assessed for safety and efficacy in two transgenic metastatic melanoma mouse models. All the NPs were safe in both models based on general appearance, weight changes, death, and blood biochemical analyses. The partially charged NPs are most effective in decreasing the number of melanocytes at both the proximal (sentinel) lymph node (LN) and the distal LN from the injection site. The neutral NPs are efficacious at the proximal LN, while the fully charged NPs have no effect on either LNs. Thus, our data indicates that the NP surface charge and lymphatic efficacy are closely tied to each other and the partially charged NPs have the highest potential in treating metastatic melanoma.  aPublisher supplied data 3agenetically modified organisms 3adrug delivery systems 3aintravenous injection 3amelanocytes 3adrugs 3ainjection site 3amelanoma 3ametastasis 3asurgery 3aanimal models 3alymph nodes 3apolymers 3adeath 3ananoparticles 3ablood 3amortality 3adrug resistance 0adrug therapy 0aMelanoma transgenic mouse model 0aLymphatic drug delivery 0aCombination therapy 0aMelanoma treatment 0aNanoparticles1 aKyryachenko, Sergiy1 aChagani, Sharmeen E.1 aAlany, Raid G.1 aRao, Deepa A.1 aIndra, Arup K.1 aAlani, Adam W.G.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9214-93170 tJournal of Controlled Release.g2015 Dec. 28, v. 220 p.503-514dElsevier B.V.x0168-36597nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jconrel.2015.11.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04219naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100005500147245014000202300001600342520254700358592002802905650002202933650001702955650001502972650001702987650002603004650001203030650001003042650002303052650001603075650002603091650002303117650001503140650002603155650001203181650000903193650001103202650001203213650000903225650001803234650001203252651001003264700002103274700002903295700002103324700002103345700002403366700002803390700002803418773012803446856008203574852000903656655001203665IND60590267120221122053949.0180619e201802  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059026712DNAL7 a10.1007/s11104-017-3535-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRiotte, Jean1http://orcid.org/0000-0002-5563-191310aOrigin of silica in rice plants and contribution of diatom Earth fertilization: insights from isotopic Si mass balance in a paddy field  ap. 481-501.  aBACKGROUND AND AIMS: The benefits of Si for crops is well evidenced but the biogeochemical cycle of Si in agriculture remains poorly documented. This study aims at identifying and quantifying the Si sources (primary and secondary soil minerals, amorphous silica, irrigation, Si-fertilizer) to rice plants. METHOD: Field experiments were carried out with and without application of diatomaceous earth (DE) under rice and bare conditions to determine the water and dissolved mass balance in paddy fields (Karnataka, Southern India). The fate of the Si brought by irrigation (DSi) (uptake by rice, uptake by diatoms, adsorption) was assessed through a solute mass balance combined with silicon isotopic signatures. RESULTS: Above the ground-surface, about one third of the DSi flux brought by borewell irrigation (545 mmol Si.m⁻²) to bare plots and half of DSi in rice plots were removed from solution within minutes or hours following irrigation. Such rate is consistent with the rate of DSi adsorption onto Fe-oxyhydroxides but not with diatom blooms. In rice and rice + DE experiments, the isotopic fractionation factor (³⁰ε) between bore well and stagnant water compositions is close to −1 ‰, i.e. the isotopic fractionation factor known for rice, indicating that above-ground DSi removal would be dominated by plant uptake upon adsorption. Within the soil layer, pore water DSi decreases much faster in rice experiments than in bare ones, demonstrating the efficiency of DSi rice uptake upon adsorption. Total irrigation-DSi to plant-Si would then represent 24 to 36% in rice experiments (over 1460 ± 270 mmol Si m⁻² in biomass) and 15 to 23% in rice + DE ones (over 2250 ± 180 mmol Si m⁻²). The δ³⁰Si signature of whole plants was significantly different in the rice + DE plot analyzed, 0.99 ± 0.07 ‰, than in the rice one, 1.29 ± 0.07 ‰. According to these δ³⁰Si signatures, the main Si source from the soil would be the amorphous silica pool (ASi). A slight contribution of DE to the rice plant could be detected from the Si isotopic signature of rice. CONCLUSIONS: The δ³⁰Si signatures of the various soil-plant compartments, when associated to Si mass balance at soil-plant scale, constitute a reliable proxy of the Si sources in paddy fields. The solute Si balance is controlled by rice uptake in rice plots and by adsorption in bare ones. The main Si sources for the rice plants were soil ASi, irrigation Si and to a lesser extent Si fertilizer when it was applied.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillariophyceae 3aOryza sativa 3aadsorption 3aalgal blooms 3abiogeochemical cycles 3abiomass 3acrops 3adiatomaceous earth 3afertilizers 3afield experimentation 3airon oxyhydroxides 3airrigation 3aisotope fractionation 3apaddies 3arice 3asilica 3asilicon 3asoil 3asoil minerals 3asolutes 3aIndia1 aSandhya, Kollalu1 aPrakash, NagabovanalliB.1 aAudry, Stéphane1 aZambardi, Thomas1 aChmeleff, Jérôme,1 aBuvaneshwari, Sriramulu1 aMeunier, Jean-Dominique0 tPlant and soil.g2018 Feb., v. 423, no. 1-2 p.481-501dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl49373x0032-079X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11104-017-3535-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02014naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001400150245011600164300002000280500001900300520077000319592002801089650002101117650001701138650002401155650001401179650002501193650001101218650001101229650001201240650001601252700005601268700001801324700001401342700006301356773011601419856008401535852000901619655001201628IND60709092020221120072758.0200902e20200802xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070909202DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.langmuir.0c014772doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSaito, Yu12aA Different Silica Surface: Radical Oxidation of Poly(methylsilsesquioxane) Thin Films and Particles (Tospearl)  ap. 10110-10119.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aSurfaces that exhibit the reactivity of silica toward surface modification (silanol condensation) were prepared by treating thin films and particles of poly(methylsilsesquioxane) with aqueous potassium persulfate at elevated temperature. Parallel experiments were carried out using a highly cross-linked poly(dimethylsiloxane). Advancing (θA) and receding (θR) water contact angles for all of these oxidized surfaces were θA/θR = ∼10/∼0°, and these low values remain unchanged for months. Reactions of these silica-like surfaces with a range of functional silane reagents indicate that the surface silanol concentration is sufficient to prepare covalently attached monolayers of similar surface density to those prepared using silicon wafers as substrates.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical bonding 3acrosslinking 3adissolved potassium 3aoxidation 3apotassium persulfate 3asilane 3asilica 3asilicon 3atemperature1 aWang, Liming1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9470-21121 aZheng, Peiwen1 aBian, Pei1 aMcCarthy, Thomas J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0414-010X0 tLangmuir.g2020 Aug. 02, v. 36, no. 34 p.10110-10119dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19170x1520-58277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.langmuir.0c014773Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02925naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002600140245010900166500001400275520143400289592002801723650001301751650001401764650001501778650001501793650001001808650001801818650001101836650001601847650001601863650002001879650001501899650001101914650001201925650001201937650002201949650002201971650001301993650001402006650001602020651002102036651001502057700002402072700002302096700002502119700002302144700001802167773012702185856007402312852000902386655001202395IND60721694420221123013858.0201224e20201126xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072169442DNAL7 a10.3390/md181205922doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDi Lorenzo, Flaviana 14aThe Structure of the Lipid A of Gram-Negative Cold-Adapted Bacteria Isolated from Antarctic Environments  aNAL-light  aGram-negative Antarctic bacteria adopt survival strategies to live and proliferate in an extremely cold environment. Unusual chemical modifications of the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and the main component of their outer membrane are among the tricks adopted to allow the maintenance of an optimum membrane fluidity even at particularly low temperatures. In particular, the LPS’ glycolipid moiety, the lipid A, typically undergoes several structural modifications comprising desaturation of the acyl chains, reduction in their length and increase in their branching. The investigation of the structure of the lipid A from cold-adapted bacteria is, therefore, crucial to understand the mechanisms underlying the cold adaptation phenomenon. Here we describe the structural elucidation of the highly heterogenous lipid A from three psychrophiles isolated from Terra Nova Bay, Antarctica. All the lipid A structures have been determined by merging data that was attained from the compositional analysis with information from a matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI) time of flight (TOF) mass spectrometry (MS) and MS² investigation. As lipid A is also involved in a structure-dependent elicitation of innate immune response in mammals, the structural characterization of lipid A from such extremophile bacteria is also of great interest from the perspective of drug synthesis and development inspired by natural sources.  aPublisher supplied data 3abacteria 3abranching 3acold zones 3adesorption 3adrugs 3aextremophiles 3aflight 3aglycolipids 3ainformation 3ainnate immunity 3aionization 3alength 3alipid A 3amammals 3amass spectrometry 3amembrane fluidity 3amoieties 3asynthesis 3atemperature 3aAntarctic region 3aAntarctica1 aCrisafi, Francesca 1 aLa Cono, Violetta 1 aYakimov, Michail  M.1 aMolinaro, Antonio 1 aSilipo, Alba 0 tMarine drugs.g2020 Nov. 26, v. 18, no. 12dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21403x1660-33977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/md181205923Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01781naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002500092040001800117100001900135245013100154300001600285500002000301520071800321592002801039650001601067650001401083650002401097650002301121650002301144700002001167700002401187700002001211773014301231852000901374856007201383655001201455IND2197472520221119123652.0200105e199811  iau|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND219747252DNAL7 a10.2307/12440582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBierlen, Ralph10aCredit Constraints, Farm Characteristics, and the Farm Economy: Differential Impacts on Feeder Cattle and Beef Cow Inventories  ap. 708-723.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aA recurrent topic in the macroeconomic literature is the financial accelerator—the notion that informational asymmetries introduce inefficiencies to financial markets which amplify and propagate the effects of real or monetary shocks. With the purpose of finding empirical evidence that is consistent with a financial accelerator operating in the cattle sector, inventory investment models are estimated with an appended cash flow variable. The inclusion of cash flow is motivated by the notion that investment by credit‐constrained farms should be sensitive to movements in internal funds. Results are consistent with the financial accelerator operating in the feeder cattle but not in the cow‐calf sector.  aPublisher supplied data 3ainventories 3abeef cows 3aagricultural credit 3acash flow analysis 3aeconometric models1 aDixon, Bruce L.1 aAhrendsen, Bruce L.1 aBarry, Peter J.0 tAmerican journal of agricultural economics.g1998 Nov., v. 80, no. 4 p.708-723dOxford University PresswJournal:jnl44932x0002-90927nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2307/12440583Available from publisher's site 7aarticle02145naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002500092040001800117100001800135245006900153300001600222500002000238520108400258592002801342650001501370650001501385650000801400650001601408650002301424650001401447650001601461650002601477650001701503651001801520700002101538773014301559852000901702856007201711655001201783IND2197471720221119123650.0200105e199811  iau|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND219747172DNAL7 a10.2307/12440552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGisser, Micha10aDo Farm Workers Earn Less? An Analysis of the Farm Labor Problem  ap. 669-682.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aDuring the four decades extending from 1950 to 1960, the ratio of the farm to nonfarm wage fluctuated between 0.45 and 0.55. We employ the Oaxaca technique and the Public Use Microdata Sample of the 1990 Census to decompose the farm/nonfarm wage differential. We also use the American Chamber of Commerce Research Association (ACCRA) cost‐of‐living data to measure the impact of the farm/nonfarm cost‐of‐living index on the wage gap. First, we find that the observed wage gap is reduced by half when nominal wages are deflated by the (ACCRA) cost‐of‐living index. Second, by applying the Oaxaca method separately to a subsample of young employees and a subsample of old employees we find that while for the subsample of employees younger than thirty‐five years the real wage gap practically vanishes, the gap for the subsample of employees who are thirty‐five years of age and over is higher than that of the total sample. This finding lends strong support to the hypothesis that between 1950 and 1970 the process of farm out‐migration was positively selective.  aPublisher supplied data 3awage rates 3afarm labor 3aage 3arural areas 3aeconometric models 3aequations 3alabor force 3arural urban migration 3alabor market 3aUnited States1 aDávila, Alberto0 tAmerican journal of agricultural economics.g1998 Nov., v. 80, no. 4 p.669-682dOxford University PresswJournal:jnl44932x0002-90927nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2307/12440553Available from publisher's site 7aarticle01308naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245008600158300001800244520028500262592002800547650002200575650001300597650002100610650002600631700001300657700001800670700001500688700001900703700001200722700001900734773013400753856007400887852000900961655001200970IND60638918620221120105853.0190501e20160719xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063891862DNAL7 a10.1039/c6cc04070e2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXie, Tongqing10aUV gelation of single-component polyacrylates bearing dinitrobenzoate side groups  ap. 9383-9386.  aPolyacrylates bearing dinitrobenzoate side groups undergo sol–gel–sol transformations in DMF or THF solutions regulated by alternating UV light and dark conditions.

In such organisms, β-lactam resistance arises principally from β-lactamase production. Although carbapenems escape the activity of most β-lactamases, due in the class A enzymes to slow deacylation of the covalent acylenzyme intermediate, carbapenem-hydrolyzing class A β-lactamases are now disseminating in clinically relevant bacteria. The reasons why carbapenems are substrates for these enzymes, but inhibit other class A β-lactamases, remain to be fully established. Here, we present crystal structures of the class A carbapenemase SFC-1 from Serratia fonticola and of complexes of its Ser70 Ala (Michaelis) and Glu166 Ala (acylenzyme) mutants with the carbapenem meropenem. These are the first crystal structures of carbapenem complexes of a class A carbapenemase. Our data reveal that, in the SFC-1 acylenzyme complex, the meropenem 6α-1R-hydroxyethyl group interacts with Asn132, but not with the deacylating water molecule. Molecular dynamics simulations indicate that this mode of binding occurs in both the Michaelis and acylenzyme complexes of wild-type SFC-1. In carbapenem-inhibited class A β-lactamases, it is proposed that the deacylating water molecule is deactivated by interaction with the carbapenem 6α-1R-hydroxyethyl substituent. Structural comparisons with such enzymes suggest that in SFC-1 subtle repositioning of key residues (Ser70, Ser130, Asn132 and Asn170) enlarges the active site, permitting rotation of the carbapenem 6α-1R-hydroxyethyl group and abolishing this contact. Our data show that SFC-1, and by implication other such carbapenem-hydrolyzing enzymes, uses Asn132 to orient bound carbapenems for efficient deacylation and prevent their interaction with the deacylating water molecule.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGram-negative bacteria 3aSerratia 3aactive sites 3abeta-lactamase 3acrystal structure 3acrystallography 3adrugs 3ahydrolysis 3ameropenem 3amolecular dynamics 3amutants1 aChudyk, Ewa I.1 avan der Kamp, Marc W.1 aCorreia, A.q(Antonio),1 aMulholland, Adrian J.1 aSpencer, James0 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2012 Nov. 07, v. 134, no. 44 p.18275-18285dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fja304460j3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01891naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002700150245011800177300001400295520091300309592002801222650001201250650001401262650002301276650001101299650001201310700003001322700002001352773008901372856008401461990002301545852000901568655001201577IND60092473020221119084402.0141103e20120105xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009247302DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cattod.2011.07.0382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aÁlvaro-Muñoz, Teresa10aUse of different templates on SAPO-34 synthesis: Effect on the acidity and catalytic activity in the MTO reaction  ap. 27-34.  aSAPO-34 molecular sieves have been synthesized with different structure directing agents. Although materials with the same framework structure (CHA type) are obtained in all cases, they possess different physicochemical properties, especially textural parameters and crystal size. These catalysts have been tested in the MTO process. All the samples exhibited high activity and selectivity to short chain olefins at the initial stages of the reaction, but they deactivate rapidly with time on stream, especially at high space velocity. It has been observed an important influence of the external surface, crystal size and acidity on the activity, selectivity and lifetime of the different samples. Thus, the sample synthesized with tetraethylammonium hydroxide as structure directing agent rendered the best catalytic performance owing to its higher external surface, smaller crystal size and higher acidity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacidity 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3asieves 3astreams1 aMárquez-Álvarez, Carlos1 aSastre, Enrique0 tCatalysis today.g2012 Jan. 5, v. 179, no. 1 p.27-34dElsevier B.V.x0920-58617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cattod.2011.07.0383Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02899naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001600139245009300155300002000248520135200268592002801620650001701648650000801665650002301673650002101696650001301717650001701730650004101747650000901788650002401797650001601821650001301837650004401850650001901894650001701913650001101930650003701941650001301978650002601991700002502017700001702042700001802059700001302077700001602090700001602106700001602122700001302138773013402151856007502285852000902360655001202369IND60538708320221122060642.0160815e20121107xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053870832DNAL7 a10.1021/ja305198p2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Renhong10aRadical-Involved Photosynthesis of AuCN Oligomers from Au Nanoparticles and Acetonitrile  ap. 18286-18294.  aWe show here the first radical route for the direct photosynthesis of AuCN oligomers with different sizes and shapes, as evidenced by TEM observations, from an Au nanoparticle/benzaldehyde/CH₃CN ternary system in air under UV-light irradiation. This photochemical route is green, mild, and universal, which makes itself distinguishable from the common cyanidation process. Several elementary reaction steps, including the strong C–C bond dissociation of CH₃CN and subsequent •CN radical addition to Au, have been suggested to be critical in the formation of AuCN oligomers based on the identification of •CN radical by in situ EPR and the radical trapping technique, and other reaction products by GC-MS and ¹H NMR, and DFT calculations. The resulting solid-state AuCN oligomers exhibit unique spectroscopic characters that may be a result of the shorter Au–Au distances (namely, aurophilicity) and/or special polymer-like structures as compared with gold cyanide derivatives in the aqueous phase. The nanosized AuCN oligomers supported on mesoporous silica showed relatively good catalytic activity on the homogeneous annulation of salicylaldehyde with phenylacetylene to afford isoflavanones employing PBu₃ as the cocatalyst under moderate conditions, which also serves as evidence for the successful production of AuCN oligomers.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetonitrile 3aair 3acatalytic activity 3achemical bonding 3acyanides 3adissociation 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3agold 3ahydroxybenzaldehyde 3airradiation 3ananogold 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aphotosynthesis 3aporous media 3asilica 3atransmission electron microscopy 3atrapping 3aultraviolet radiation1 aKobayashi, Hisayoshi1 aTong, Jiawei1 aYan, Xiaoqing1 aTang, Yu1 aZou, Shihui1 aJin, Jiabin1 aYi, Wuzhong1 aFan, Jie0 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2012 Nov. 07, v. 134, no. 44 p.18286-18294dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fja305198p3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03966naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245012700172300001600299500001500315520222700330592002802557650001602585650001302601650001902614650001802633650001402651650001302665650002802678650001102706650002102717650000902738650002702747650001902774650002302793650002302816650001602839650002002855650002002875653001702895653002202912653000902934653002202943653001602965653002002981700001703001700001703018700001703035700001203052700001703064700001703081700001803098700005503116773009903171856008503270852000903355655001203364IND60583026120221120132721.0171008e20151228xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058302612DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jconrel.2015.11.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuang, Pingsheng10aCo-delivery of doxorubicin and 131I by thermosensitive micellar-hydrogel for enhanced in situ synergetic chemoradiotherapy  ap. 456-464.  a2019-12-06  aCombined chemoradiotherapy is potent to defeat malignant tumor. Concurrent delivery of radioisotope with chemotherapeutic drugs, which also act as the radiosensitizer, to tumor tissues by a single vehicle is essential to achieve this objective. To this end, a macroscale injectable and thermosensitive micellar-hydrogel (MHg) depot was constructed by thermo-induced self-aggregation of poly(ε-caprolactone-co-1,4,8-trioxa[4.6]spiro-9-undecanone)-poly(ethyleneglycol)-poly(ε-caprolactone-co-1,4,8-trioxa[4.6]spiro-9-undecanone) (PECT) triblock copolymer micelles (Ms), which could not only serve as a micellar drug reservoir to locally deliver concentrated nano chemotherapeutic drugs, but also immobilize radioisotopes at the internal irradiation hot focus. Doxorubicin (DOX) and iodine-131 labeled hyaluronic acid (131I-HA) were used as the model therapeutic agents. The aqueous mixture of drug-loaded PECT micelles and 131I-HA exhibited sol-to-gel transition around body temperature. In vitro drug release study indicated that PECT/DOX Ms were sustainedly shed from the native PECT/DOX MHg formulation, which could be internalized by tumor cells with rapid intracellular DOX release. This hydrogel formulation demonstrated considerable in vitro antitumor effect as well as remarkable radiosensitization. In vivo subcutaneous injection of PECT MHg demonstrated that 131I isotope was immobilized stably at the injection location and no obvious indication of damage to major organs were observed as indicated by the histopathological analysis. Furthermore, the peritumoral injection of chemo-radiation therapeutic agents-encapsulated MHg formulation on tumor-bearing nude mice resulted in the desired combined treatment effect, which significantly improved the tumor growth inhibition efficiency with minimized drug-associated side effects to major organs. Consequently, such a thermosensitive MHg formulation, which enabled the precise control over the dosage and ratio of combination therapeutic agents to obtain the desired therapeutic effect with a single drug administration and reduced side effects, holds great potential for spatiotemporally delivery of multiple bioactive agents for sustained combination therapy.  aPublisher supplied data 3adoxorubicin 3amicelles 3ahistopathology 3aradionuclides 3ahydrogels 3aisotopes 3aantineoplastic activity 3amodels 3abody temperature 3amice 3asubcutaneous injection 3aneoplasm cells 3agrowth retardation 3acomposite polymers 3airradiation 3ahyaluronic acid 3aadverse effects 0adrug therapy 0aChemoradiotherapy 0a131I 0aMicellar hydrogel 0aDoxorubicin 0aTumor treatment1 aZhang, Yumin1 aWang, Weiwei1 aZhou, Junhui1 aSun, Yu1 aLiu, Jinjian1 aKong, Deling1 aLiu, Jianfeng1 aDong, Anjie1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9195-79720 tJournal of Controlled Release.g2015 Dec. 28, v. 220 p.456-464dElsevier B.V.x0168-36597nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jconrel.2015.11.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03664naa a2200649 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245011400165300001600279520174800295592002802043650000802071650002202079650002102101650001402122650001802136650001502154650001302169650001802182650001802200650003802218650002102256650002002277650002102297650002102318650000902339650001802348650001602366650001202382650003902394650003002433650002202463650002502485650002502510650003302535650002202568650001802590650001602608650001302624700001802637700001702655700002002672700001802692700001702710700002302727700001902750700001902769700001602788773010802804856008102912852000902993655001203002IND60573803720221117235255.0170725e201701  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057380372DNAL7 a10.1007/s00436-016-5298-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNabi, Habibun10aInduction of specific humoral immune response in mice immunized with ROP18 nanospheres from Toxoplasma gondii  ap. 359-370.  aToxoplasmosis is one of the most common zoonotic protozoal diseases. Recent advances in biotechnology have produced recombinant protein, which are immunogenic, and progress in nano-pharmaceutics has generated encapsulated protein in nanospheres, which are suitable for vaccine delivery. DNA was extracted from Toxoplasma gondii oocysts and was confirmed through nested PCR and sequencing. The 1665 bp of ROP18 was cloned into the easy vector system: pGEM-T by the T-A cloning method. DH5α bacteria were transfected with pGEM-ROP18. ROP18 was subcloned from pGEM-ROP18 into pET28-ROP18. BL21 bacteria were transfected with pET28-ROP18. Thus, rROP18 protein was expressed in BL21 bacteria by induction at different concentrations of isopropyl β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside. Protein expression was confirmed through SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. The immunoblot of rROP18 was recognized by anti-HIS antibodies and sera from infected mice at 67 kDa. Recombinant ROP18 protein was encapsulated in nanoparticles with PLGA and was characterized through scanning electron microscopy. Intraperitoneal immunizations with rROP18 protein and intranasal immunization of nanospheres were carried out in mice, and the immune response was detected by ELISA. Results showed that rROP18 in nanospheres administered intra-nasally elicited elevated responses of specific IgA and IgG2a as compared to groups inoculated intra-nasally with rROP18 alone, or injected subcutaneously with rROP18 in montanide adjuvant. It was concluded that nanospheres of ROP18 would be a non-invasive approach to develop vaccination against T. gondii. Further experiments are needed to determine the cellular response to these nanospheres in a mouse model for chronic toxoplasmosis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aToxoplasma gondii 3aWestern blotting 3aadjuvants 3aanimal models 3aantibodies 3abacteria 3abiotechnology 3aencapsulation 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3ahumoral immunity 3aimmune response 3aimmunoglobulin A 3aimmunoglobulin G 3amice 3ananoparticles 3ananospheres 3aoocysts 3apolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aprotein synthesis 3aprotozoal infections 3arecombinant proteins 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asequence analysis 3atoxoplasmosis 3avaccination 3avaccines1 aRashid, Imran1 aAhmad, Nisar1 aDurrani, Aneela1 aAkbar, Haroon1 aIslam, Saher1 aBajwa, Amna Arshad1 aShehzad, Wasim1 aAshraf, Kamran1 aImran, Nyla0 tParasitology research.g2017 Jan., v. 116, no. 1 p.359-370dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx0932-01137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00436-016-5298-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02449naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001800144242011600162245011300278300001400391520124100405592002801646650002101674650001501695650001401710650002001724650001501744650003201759650001001791653001601801653001601817653002501833653003101858773011101889856007802000852000902078655001202087IND60711544820221121090525.0200928e20200918xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071154482DNAL7 a10.2478/fsmu-2020-00042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPadari, Allar10aMathematical analysis and modification possibilities of Ozolinš’ taper curve on the example of Hiiumaa pines10aOzolinši tüvemoodustaja matemaatiline analüüs ja modifitseerimise võimalused Hiiumaa männikute näitel  ap. 34-53.  aThis paper discloses algorithms for calculating the volume and lateral area of a stem or part of the stem (assortment) using the integral of the Ozolinš’ stem taper curve. An algorithm was also developed to change the taper curve constants in case another diameter was measured higher than the breast height. The experiment was performed with 580 Scots pines (Pinus Sylvestris L.) measured in Hiiumaa, which included height, diameter at breast height and diameter from the root collar at a height of 5 m. The volumes of tree stem and assortments were estimated with both – the original and corrected (with the measured additional diameter) Ozolinš’ taper curve. Using the original Ozolinš’ taper curve, the stem volume of pines in Hiiumaa is estimated at 4% higher according to the analysis results of 580 measured trees. In the case of Hiiumaa Scots pines (Pinus Sylvestris L.), it is recommended to use 119.717, −289.805 and 1152.016 as the values of the coefficients a₀, a₁ and a₂, respectively, of the Ozolinš’ taper curve equation. In conclusion, for a more accurate assessment of the forest reserve, it is recommended to measure one additional diameter at 5 to 8 m above the root collar on some or all trees.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPinus sylvestris 3aalgorithms 3aequations 3aforest reserves 3aroot crown 3atree and stand measurements 3atrees 0ataper curve 0astem volume 0avolume of assortment 0alateral area of assortment0 tMetsanduslikud uurimused.g2020 Sept. 18, v. 72, no. 1 p.34-53dSciendowJournal:jnl24762x1736-87237nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2478/fsmu-2020-00043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03029naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245010400167300001400271520184900285592002802134650001602162650001502178650001402193650002302207650001502230650001102245650001302256650001202269650001402281650003302295650001602328650001302344700001802357700001902375700002002394773008902414856008402503990002302587852000902610655001202619IND60092473520221119084222.0141103e20120105xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009247352DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cattod.2011.06.0362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAkhtar, M.N.10aAromatization of alkanes over Pt promoted conventional and mesoporous gallosilicates of MEL zeolite  ap. 61-72.  aAromatization of hexane and propane was investigated over Pt promoted mesoporous gallium-containing HZSM-11 with controlled mesoporosity generated by desilication. Prepared catalysts were characterized by nitrogen adsorption, X-ray powder diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, Fourier transform infrared of chemisorbed pyridine, and NH₃ temperature programmed desorption confirming the development of intracrystalline mesoporosity of Ga-containing HZSM-11. The catalytic activities, which were compared in the aromatization of n-hexane and propane, increased upon desilication. The aromatization of n-hexane decreased in the following order, Pt/mesoporous GaZSM-11≫Pt/conventional GaZSM-11≫mesoporous GaZSM-11>conventional GaZSM-11. Hexane conversion reached 70.1% over mesoporous Pt/GaZSM-11 with Si/Ga of 61, as compared with 29.6 and 24.9% for corresponding mesoporous and conventional GaZSM-11 (Si/Ga=94), respectively, for experiments at liquid hour space velocity of 3.6h⁻¹, and 540°C. Comparison of BTX (benzene–toluene–xylene) selectivity at the conversion level of ∼21.0% revealed that Pt/mesoporous GaZSM-11 is more selective than corresponding mesoporous and conventional GaZSM-11. The BTX selectivity over Pt/mesoporous GaZSM-11 (Si/Ga=94), which showed strong dependence on the conversion, reached 28.2%, whereas over corresponding mesoporous and conventional GaZSM-11catalysts reached 19.1% and 5.5%, respectively. A higher conversion and better selectivity can be attributed to the improved accessibility to the active extra-framework Ga species owing to the generation of mesopores inside the zeolite particles and shortening the contact time. It is worth mentioning that the prepared catalysts exhibited quite low activity in propane aromatization but exhibiting similar trends as for hexane aromatization.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-radiation 3aadsorption 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3adesorption 3ahexane 3anitrogen 3apropane 3apyridines 3ascanning electron microscopy 3atemperature 3azeolites1 aAl-Yassir, N.1 aAl-Khattaf, S.1 aČejka, Jiří,0 tCatalysis today.g2012 Jan. 5, v. 179, no. 1 p.61-72dElsevier B.V.x0920-58617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cattod.2011.06.0363Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01852naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002000144242009000164245006300254300001400317520064200331592002800973650001901001650002001020650001201040650002301052650001101075650001101086650003201097650001001129651001201139653001401151653001401165653001401179653001401193653001601207653002101223773011101244856007801355852000901433655001201442IND60711545020221121124109.0200928e20200918xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071154502DNAL7 a10.2478/fsmu-2020-00062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKasesalu, Heino10aThe results of cultivating tree and shrub species of Far-Eastern origin at Järvselja10aKaug-Ida päritoluga puittaimede kasvatamisest Järvseljal  ap. 64-74.  aThis paper is based on a data set of more than 90 years of experience in cultivation of tree and shrub species of Far-Eastern origin at Järvselja Training and Experimental Forest District.

The poly(l-lysine) (PLL) backbone is self-assembled onto the surface by charged-based interactions between the lysine groups and the negatively charged silicon oxide surface, whereas the poly(N-(2-hydroxypropyl)methacrylamide) [poly(HPMA)] side chains, grown by reversible addition–fragmentation chain-transfer (RAFT) polymerization, provide antifouling properties to the surface. First, the PLL–poly(HPMA) coatings are synthesized in a bottom-up fashion through a grafting-from approach. In this route, the PLL is self-assembled onto a surface, after which a polymerization agent is immobilized, and finally HPMA is polymerized from the surface. In the second explored route, the PLL is modified in solution by a RAFT agent to create a macroinitiator. After self-assembly of this macroinitiator onto the surface, poly(HPMA) is polymerized from the surface by RAFT. In the third and last route, the whole PLL–poly(HPMA) bottlebrush is initially synthesized in solution. To this end, HPMA is polymerized from the macroinitiator in solution and the PLL–poly(HPMA) bottlebrush is then self-assembled onto the surface in just one step (grafting-to approach). Additionally, in this third route, we also design and synthesize a bottlebrush polymer with a PLL backbone and poly(HPMA) side chains, with the latter containing 5% carboxybetaine (CB) monomers that eventually allow for additional (bio)functionalization in solution or after surface immobilization. These three routes are evaluated in terms of ease of synthesis, scalability, ease of characterization, and a preliminary investigation of their antifouling performance. All three coating procedures result in coatings that show antifouling properties in single-protein antifouling tests. This method thus presents a new, simple, versatile, and highly scalable approach for the manufacturing of PLL-based bottlebrush coatings that can be synthesized partly or completely on the surface or in solution, depending on the desired production process and/or application.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantifouling activities 3alysine 3apolymerization 3apolymers 3asilica1 aKuzmyn, Andriy R.1 aScheres, Luc1 aBaggerman, Jacob1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9058-65911 aSmulders, Maarten M.

The present study proposes a generalized cross‐entropy approach to estimate activity‐specific input allocations that are consistent with the aggregate information. The proposed method does not require behavioral assumptions (e.g., profit maximization) but does accommodate behavioral restrictions as well as nonsample information about the plausible factor shares across enterprises.

Till date, there are several rootstocks evolved of which some have become commercial in many advanced countries. Different types of grafting and budding methods have been tried in grape with varying success rates. Hence, to standardize the same for Pusa Urvashi, different rootstocks (Dogridge A, Salt Creek, 1613 and H-144) involving different grafting methods (wedge, side and bench grafting) were tried. The grafting factors like month (February, March and August) and grafting height (15, 30 and 45 cm) were standardized using one-year-old rootstocks under glasshouse conditions. The highest graft take success was registered in wedge followed by side in all the three months, while for bench grafting, the highest graft take was recoded in the month of February. The graft take was the maximum at the height of 30 cm, while the minimum was noted at 15 cm. Of the three grafting months, February was found the best with respect to percentage graft success and survival. Dogridge A as rootstock was proven most compatible with Pusa Urvashi as compared to other rootstocks.  aPublisher supplied data 3agrapes 3agreenhouses 3arootstocks 3astreams 3aviticulture 0aGrafting technique 0agrape 0aseason1 aSingh, S.K.1 aHare Krishna,1 aPatel, V.B.0 tIndian journal of horticulture.g2012 Mar., v. 69, no. 1 p.13-19dHorticultural Society of India (Regd.)wJournal:2099x0974-01127nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle01993naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001800152245013900170300001600309520084800325592002801173650001401201650001501215650001201230650002001242650001301262650002201275650001601297653001201313653001401325653000901339653001901348653002501367700002401392773010701416856008701523852000901610655001201619IND60536620520221116143717.0190409e201509  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053662052DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2015.04.1022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFarobie, Obie12aA comparative study of biodiesel production using methanol, ethanol, and tert-butyl methyl ether (MTBE) under supercritical conditions  ap. 306-311.  aIn this study, biodiesel production under supercritical conditions among methanol, ethanol, and tert-butyl methyl ether (MTBE) was compared in order to elucidate the differences in their reaction behavior.

The reaction kinetics of biodiesel production was also compared for supercritical methanol, ethanol, and MTBE.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiodiesel 3acanola oil 3aethanol 3afuel production 3amethanol 3areaction kinetics 3atemperature 0aBiomass 0aBiodiesel 0aMTBE 0aSpiral reactor 0aSupercritical fluids1 aMatsumura, Yukihiko0 tBioresource technology.g2015 Sept., v. 191 p.306-311dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46263x0960-85247nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2015.04.1023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02890naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001300147245011600160300001600276520132500292592002801617650001501645650002001660650001401680650001401694650001401708650001001722650001301732650001101745650001701756650002001773650003801793650002101831650002401852650001901876650001901895650002201914650001701936650001501953650001701968700002001985700001902005700001902024700001502043700001402058700001802072700001702090700001302107700001802120773010802138856008102246852000902327655001202336IND60573804020221117235218.0170725e201701  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057380402DNAL7 a10.1007/s00436-016-5283-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Shan10aMitochondrial pathways are involved in Eimeria tenella-induced apoptosis of chick embryo cecal epithelial cells  ap. 225-235.  aAccumulating evidence suggests that Eimeria tenella severely damages the intestinal mucosa in infected poultry, resulting in deadly haemorrhagic typhlocolitis and major economic losses. Damage to host tissue is believed to arise mainly from apoptosis, which is, in general, intimately related to mitochondrial function. However, it is unclear whether mitochondria-dependent apoptotic pathways are specifically involved in parasite-induced apoptosis of chick embryo cecal epithelial cells. Because the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (MPTP) and caspase-9 are important elements in these pathways, we studied the effects of their respective inhibitors (i.e., cyclosporine A [CsA] and Z-LEHD-FMK, respectively) in primary cultures of chicken embryonic cecum epithelial cells using histopathological techniques, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labelling (TUNEL) assays, flow cytometry (FCM) and ELISA. Results indicated that the inhibitors significantly decreased (p < 0.01) DNA injury, apoptosis and caspase-9 and caspase-3 activity of chick embryo cecal epithelial cells at 24, 48, 72, 96 and 120 h after E. tenella infection. Thus, our data supported that mitochondria-dependent apoptotic pathways were involved in apoptosis of parasitised chick embryo cecal epithelial cells.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA damage 3aEimeria tenella 3aapoptosis 3acaspase-3 3acaspase-9 3acecum 3achickens 3achicks 3acyclosporine 3aembryo (animal) 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3aepithelial cells 3afinancial economics 3aflow cytometry 3ahistopathology 3aintestinal mucosa 3amitochondria 3aparasitism 3apermeability1 aZheng, Ming-xue1 aXu, Huan-cheng1 aCui, Xiao-zhen1 aZhang, Yan1 aZhang, Li1 aYang, Sha-sha1 aXu, Zhi-yong1 aBai, Rui1 aSun, Xu-guang0 tParasitology research.g2017 Jan., v. 116, no. 1 p.225-235dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx0932-01137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00436-016-5283-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02999naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002100152245008700173300001200260520164700272592002801919650002601947650001901973650001301992650001402005650001402019650001802033650001702051650002102068650001602089650001502105650001302120651001902133653002902152653002602181653002102207653004302228653003302271700001802304700002302322700001602345773008502361856008602446852000902532655001202541IND60547333820221120072739.0170502e201508  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054733382DNAL7 a10.1016/j.atmosenv.2015.05.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCoello, Jonathan13aAn AIS-based approach to calculate atmospheric emissions from the UK fishing fleet  ap. 1-7.  aThe fishing industry is heavily reliant on the use of fossil fuel and emits large quantities of greenhouse gases and other atmospheric pollutants. Methods used to calculate fishing vessel emissions inventories have traditionally utilised estimates of fuel efficiency per unit of catch. These methods have weaknesses because they do not easily allow temporal and geographical allocation of emissions. A large proportion of fishing and other small commercial vessels are also omitted from global shipping emissions inventories such as the International Maritime Organisation's Greenhouse Gas Studies. This paper demonstrates an activity-based methodology for the production of temporally- and spatially-resolved emissions inventories using data produced by Automatic Identification Systems (AIS). The methodology addresses the issue of how to use AIS data for fleets where not all vessels use AIS technology and how to assign engine load when vessels are towing trawling or dredging gear. The results of this are compared to a fuel-based methodology using publicly available European Commission fisheries data on fuel efficiency and annual catch. The results show relatively good agreement between the two methodologies, with an estimate of 295.7 kilotons of fuel used and 914.4 kilotons of carbon dioxide emitted between May 2012 and May 2013 using the activity-based methodology. Different methods of calculating speed using AIS data are also compared. The results indicate that using the speed data contained directly in the AIS data is preferable to calculating speed from the distance and time interval between consecutive AIS data points.  aPublisher supplied data 3aatmospheric chemistry 3acarbon dioxide 3adredging 3aemissions 3afisheries 3afishing boats 3afossil fuels 3agreenhouse gases 3ainventories 3apollutants 3ashipping 3aUnited Kingdom 0aGreenhouse gas emissions 0aAtmospheric pollution 0aUK fishing fleet 0aAutomatic Identification Systems (AIS) 0aShipping emissions inventory1 aWilliams, Ian1 aHudson, Dominic A.1 aKemp, Simon0 tAtmospheric environment.g2015 Aug., v. 114 p.1-7dElsevier Ltdx1352-23107nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.atmosenv.2015.05.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02833naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002000144245016200164300001500326520158600341592002801927650001601955650001101971650001601982650002101998650001402019650001302033650001402046650002102060650001102081651001202092653001302104653001302117653001202130653001302142653001702155700001902172700002102191773011202212856007802324852000902402655001202411IND60711545220221121124138.0200928e20200918xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071154522DNAL7 a10.2478/fsmu-2020-00082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHytönen, Jyrki14aThe effect of planting, seeding and soil preparation on the regeneration success of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) on drained peatlands – 10-year results  ap. 91-106.  aWe studied the effect of regeneration (planting/seeding) and soil preparation methods (no soil preparation/scalping/mounding) on the regeneration success of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) on three drained peatland Scots pine stands in northern Finland. After ten years, planting and sowing showed no differences in the total number of Scots pine seedlings (one seedling per sowing spot accepted) with the exception of the Sievi experiment. Without soil preparation the total number of Scots pine seedlings was 350–600 per ha. Scalping increased the number of Scots pine seedlings to 550–900 per ha, with the exception of seeding at Sievi. In mounded plots, with the exception of seeded plots at the Sievi site, the number of planted or seeded seedlings was 1,325–2,350 per ha. The number of crop seedlings in all the experiments and for all the soil preparation treatments reached the target of 2,000 seedlings per ha if naturally regenerated Scots pine, Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) H. Karst.) or birch (Betula spp.) seedlings were accepted as such. Moose (Alces alces L.) damage in Scots pine crop seedlings ranged from 4% in Sievi to 65% in Simo. The proportion of planted or seeded Scots pines of the crop seedlings was 23% in unprepared plots, 30% in scalped plots and 75% in mounded plots. Mounding increased the share of Scots pine seedlings in the overall crop seedlings. Planted seedlings were taller than seeded seedlings. Planting in mounds gave the best overall results in terms of the number of crop seedlings and their height ten years after the treatment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAlces alces 3aBetula 3aPicea abies 3aPinus sylvestris 3apeatlands 3aplanting 3aseedlings 3asite preparation 3asowing 3aFinland 0amounding 0ascalping 0aseeding 0apeatland 0aregeneration1 aHökkä, Hannu1 aSaarinen, Markku0 tMetsanduslikud uurimused.g2020 Sept. 18, v. 72, no. 1 p.91-106dSciendowJournal:jnl24762x1736-87237nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2478/fsmu-2020-00083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03602naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245014500166300001600311506011700327506007600444520182700520592002802347506003702375650002202412650002502434650001302459650002002472650001902492650001302511650001102524650002002535650001302555650001802568650001602586650001802602650001502620650001802635650001302653651001402666653001302680653003702693653002402730653002702754653002002781700002902801700003202830773011802862856008302980852000903063655001203072IND60778161120221207091414.0220802e202208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077816112DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jglr.2022.05.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHurst, Nia R.10aTemperature, redox, and amendments alter wetland soil inorganic phosphorus retention dynamics in a Laurentian Great Lakes priority watershed  ap. 935-943.  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aSurface water phosphorus loading must be reduced to improve water quality and decrease harmful algal blooms. Many wetlands have a natural capacity to retain inorganic reactive PO₄³⁻ via soil sorption. However, soil PO₄³⁻ retention capacity is finite and may be limited by soil legacy phosphorus effects in agricultural and urban areas. This study evaluated soil PO₄³⁻ retention in soils from a wetland constructed on former agricultural land in the Lake Erie, Maumee River watershed targeted for nutrient load reduction. Soil PO₄³⁻ sorption isotherms were evaluated under cool (10 °C), warm (22°), aerobic, and anaerobic treatments to determine changes in PO₄³⁻ retention due to environmental conditions and estimate seasonal changes in PO₄³⁻ sorption. The soils displayed a strong capacity for PO₄³⁻ retention by sorption. However, results indicate that cooler temperatures and anaerobic conditions decreased PO₄³⁻ sorption and lowered retention rates at PO₄³⁻ concentrations observed in the region. Soil amendment experiments investigated opportunities to increase PO₄³⁻ retention because many soils display elevated phosphorus concentrations due to historic land use, limiting their ability to adsorb additional PO₄³⁻. Amendments increased PO₄³⁻ retention capacity compared to unamended soils in the presence of high PO₄³⁻ concentrations, suggesting soil PO₄³⁻ retention can be improved in areas where natural storage capacity has been exhausted. Results from this study can inform natural resources managers in the Laurentian Great Lakes and elsewhere when identifying potential nutrient reduction wetland locations and assist with developing operational guidelines to optimize PO₄³⁻ retention and water quality improvements using wetlands.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aagricultural land 3ainorganic phosphorus 3aland use 3apoisonous algae 3apollution load 3aresearch 3arivers 3asoil amendments 3asorption 3asurface water 3atemperature 3awater quality 3awatersheds 3awetland soils 3awetlands 3aLake Erie 0aWetlands 0aSoil phosphorus storage capacity 0aConstructed wetland 0aLaurentian Great Lakes 0aSoil amendments1 aVanZomeren, Christine M.1 aBerkowitz, Jacob F.,d1979-0 tJournal of Great Lakes research.g2022 Aug., v. 48, no. 4 p.935-943dElsevier B.V.wJournal:2035x0380-13307nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jglr.2022.05.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01828naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094024002200122024001900144040001800163100006800181245010900249300002000358506007600378520043100454592002800885506003700913650002100950650002300971650002600994650001901020650001501039700001801054700001701072700002301089700002301112700001601135700002101151700002701172773013601199856007401335852000901409655001201418IND60638919420221207132335.0190501e20160818xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063891942DNAL7 a10.1039/c6cc04127b2doi7 aPMC50156522pmcid7 a274913572pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPoelmaThese authors contributed equally to this work., Saemi O.10aControlled drug release to cancer cells from modular one-photon visible light-responsive micellar system  ap. 10525-10528.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aWe present a one-photon visible light-responsive micellar system for efficient, on-demand delivery of small molecules.

Four commercial vineyards in Virginia were sampled in 2012 and 2013 to study the basic biology, seasonality, and distribution pattern of H. halys in vineyards. At each vineyard, two blocks were selected. Weekly 3-min timed count visual samplings were performed in border and interior sections from late May until mid-September. Overwintering adult bugs were first detected in vineyards in May; however, the timing of first detection differed among vineyards. Egg masses were found primarily in June and July, and were usually found on the lower surface of grape leaves, although they were occasionally on the upper leaf surface, on the berry, or on the rachis. All developmental stages of H. halys were found in vineyards, suggesting that grape can serve as a reproductive host for H. halys. Substantial variation in H. halys densities was found among vineyards and throughout the growing season. The first instars were found on egg masses and after molting, dispersed throughout the grape vines. The date on which the first egg mass was collected was considered as a biofix. Based on a degree—day model, there were sufficient degree—days for completion of a generation in Virginia vineyards. Significantly higher numbers of H. halys were collected in border sections compared with interior sections.

An attempt was made to develop a low-cost foldable solar dryer to aid self-reliance of homesteads. The novel solar dryer was based on light-weight foldable skeleton and UV stabilized polyethylene enclosure with a solar powered forced air circulation system. The developed solar dryer with a capacity to dry 50 coconuts in a batch (100 splits) could reduce the moisture level of freshly harvested coconut kernels from 48 per cent (d. b.) to a safe moisture level below 7 per cent (d. b.) on fifth day of drying. Though drying period of developed solar dryer was similar to the conventional sun drying method, the quality of copra produced was indisputably superior. The fungal infection in the copra was substantially lowered (9%) compared to open sun drying (35%) by virtue of the hygienic and protected drying in the enclosed drying chamber. The developed solar dryer is useful for drying other food products also as it can provide complete protection of the materials against dust, insect and unseasonal precipitation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCOVID-19 infection 3acoconut meal 3acoconuts 3adust 3afood supply chain 3afungi 3ahygiene 3ainsects 3apolyethylene 3askeleton 3asolar dryers 3aventilation systems 3awater content 0aCoconut 0aDrying curve 0aSolar dryer 0aSun drying1 aKhatawkar, Dipak S.1 aBovas, J.J.L.1 aPrasad, A.1 aJames, A.0 tAgricultural engineering today.g2021 June, v. 45, no. 2 p.1-7dIndian Society of Agricultural EngineerswJournal:2069x2230-72657nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.52151/aet2021452.15323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02404naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002800148245014900176300001800325520111700343592002801460650001401488650002001502650001501522650001901537650001401556650000901570650001301579650002001592650001001612650001601622650001801638650001501656700003001671700002501701700002301726773016601749856008201915852000901997655001202006IND60637026320221118055951.0190413e201903  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063702632DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-019-04286-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJayaraman, Kamalakannan10aEffect of hydrogen addition on performance, emission, and combustion characteristics of Deccan hemp oil and its methyl ester–fuelled CI engine  ap. 8685-8695.  aA vegetable oil–fueled diesel engine operation is characterized by low brake thermal efficiency and relatively high smoke emission. Conversion of vegetable oil to biodiesel results in slight improvement in efficiency and smoke emission, but the values are not comparable with diesel. In this work, a single-cylinder diesel engine’s performance is evaluated by inducting hydrogen in small quantities in the intake manifold along with Deccan hemp oil (DHO) and its methyl ester (DHOME) as the pilot fuel. The tests were conducted at part-load and full-load conditions at an engine speed of 1500 rpm. Results indicate an increase in brake thermal efficiency from 29.7 to 32.6% and from 27.3 to 29.6% at full load with hydrogen-induced DHOME and DHO engine operation. Unburned-hydrocarbon emissions, carbon monoxide emission, and smoke emission reduced for both the fuels. However, NOx levels increased for the two fuels because hydrogen induction causes high combustion rates and high temperature in the combustion chamber. Hydrogen induction leads to high premixed combustion resulting in high peak pressures.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiodiesel 3acarbon monoxide 3acombustion 3adiesel engines 3aemissions 3ahemp 3ahydrogen 3anitrogen oxides 3asmoke 3atemperature 3avegetable oil 3avegetables1 aBabu, Geetha Narayanasamy1 aDhandapani, Gopinath1 aVaruvel, Edwin Geo0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research international.g2019 Mar., v. 26, no. 9 p.8685-8695dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-019-04286-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03077naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245018200168300001800350520146900368592002801837650002001865650002801885650002601913650001101939650000901950650001501959650000901974650000901983650001201992650001502004650001002019650001702029650001202046650001102058650001102069650001602080650002202096650001202118650001302130653002602143653001802169653002802187653001602215653002502231700001702256700001802273700002402291773012702315856008402442852000902526655001202535IND60122139420150626000000.0150325e20131201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012213942DNAL7 a10.1080/03235408.2013.7953562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAhmed, A.A.I.10aProtection of potato crop against Phthorimaea operculella (Zeller) infestation using frass extract of two noctuid insect pests under laboratory and storage simulation conditions  ap. 2409-2419.  aThe oviposition deterrent effect of water extract of Spodoptera littoralis and Agrotis ipsilon larval frass on Phthorimaea operculella adult females was studied using two types of larval food “Natural host and Semi-artificial diet” under laboratory and storage simulation (semi-field) conditions. Extracted frass of fed larvae on semi-artificial diet showed complete oviposition deterrent effect at treatments with 4th, 5th and 6th instars of S. littoralis , also at treatments with 1st–3rd and 6th instars of A. ipsilon , while the same effect was observed when the larvae fed on castor oil leaves as a natural host only at treatment with frass extract of A. ipsilon 6th instar larvae. Presence of low amounts of phenols and flavonoids in water extract of A. ipsilon larval frass resulted in relatively more effect as oviposition deterrent to fertile adult females on treated oviposition sites, while the opposite effect was obtained in S. littoralis larval frass experiments. At semi-field experiments, the percentage reduction of laid eggs reached 100% after two days at treatments with frass extracts of 4th and 5th S. littoralis larval instars and A. ipsilon 6th instar larvae fed on semi-artificial diet and/or castor oil leaves. Percentage reduction of laid eggs for untreated sacks reached 93.24 and 48.95% after 2 and 30 days, respectively, when placed between treated sacks, in comparison with the mean number of laid eggs for isolated control.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAgrotis ipsilon 3aPhthorimaea operculella 3aSpodoptera littoralis 3aadults 3abags 3acastor oil 3adiet 3aeggs 3afemales 3aflavonoids 3afrass 3ainsect pests 3ainstars 3alarvae 3aleaves 3aoviposition 3aoviposition sites 3aphenols 3apotatoes 0aoviposition deterrent 0afrass extract 0aPhthorimaea operculella 0apotato crop 0anoctuid insect pests1 aHashem, M.Y.1 aMohamed, S.M.1 aKhalil, S.H.

The results reveal an enhanced reactivity of both alkali metals with phosphorous at slightly elevated pressures. This enables the synthesis of Li₃P and Na₃P at room temperature (RT) starting from element precursors, bypassing the established chemical synthesis methods. Both compounds undergo a pressure-induced phase transition from the hexagonal Na₃As-type structure (stable at ambient conditions) towards a Fm3̄m (FCC) structure that remains stable up to 20 GPa. Attempts to synthesize compounds with higher alkali metal content (such as Li₅P) using high-temperature and -pressure conditions (up to 2000+ K and 30 GPa), inspired by recent theoretical predictions, were not successful.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3aambient temperature 3achemical reactions 3aphase transition 3asynthesis1 aRode, Kristen1 aGreenberg, Eran1 aPrakapenka, Vitali B.1 aSmith, Jesse S.1 aKunz, Martin1 aPickard, Chris J.1 aStavrou, Elissaios0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2020 Oct. 27, v. 8, no. 41 p.21797-21803dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d0ta08563d3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03019naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100003500149245012100184300001600305520153800321592002801859650002401887650001701911650000901928650002701937650001901964650001801983650001502001650002602016650001302042650003002055650000902085650000902094650001202103651001302115653001802128653002002146653001702166700003302183700003102216700002902247700002302276700003702299773010802336856008402444852000902528655001202537IND60632993620221122001739.0190719e201810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063299362DNAL7 a10.1016/j.still.2018.05.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBenedito Mendes Brito, Wildson10aSpatial variability of soil physical properties in Archeological Dark Earths under different uses in southern Amazon  ap. 103-111.  aThe Amazon region has soils of an anthropic formation called Anthropogenic Dark Earths (ADEs). These soils present a higher fertility and are physically different to adjacent local soils. This study aimed to investigate the conditions and spatial behavior of soil physical attributes in ADE areas cultivated with cocoa, coffee, and grassland in southern Amazon. Mapping of three ADE areas was carried out by using sampling grids of 80 m × 56 m with regular spacing of 8 m for the grassland area and 48 m × 88 m with a spacing of 6 m × 8 m for the cocoa and coffee areas. These soils were sampled at the grid crossing points at depths of 0.00–0.05; 0.05–0.10 and 0.10–0.20 m, totaling 88 points in each area. Soil physical analyses of texture, macroporosity, microporosity, total porosity, bulk density, θFC (moisture field capacity), penetration resistance, and aggregate stability were carried out. The data were submitted to descriptive statistics, geostatistics, and multivariate statistics. In the ADE area cultivated with grassland, the attributes showing moderate and weak levels of spatial dependence were those with a greater spatial continuity, i.e. texture, penetration resistance, macroporosity, microporosity, and volumetric moisture. A similar behavior was observed in the ADE areas cultivated with coffee (sand, density, penetration resistance, macroporosity, and microporosity) and cocoa (silt, clay, penetration resistance, macroporosity, and mean weight diameter of aggregates).  aPublisher supplied data 3aaggregate stability 3abulk density 3aclay 3adescriptive statistics 3afield capacity 3ageostatistics 3agrasslands 3amultivariate analysis 3aporosity 3aresistance to penetration 3asand 3asilt 3atexture 3aAmazonia 0aGeostatistics 0aAnthropic soils 0aMultivariate1 aCampos, Milton César Costa,1 aCampos Mantovanelli, Bruno1 ada Cunha, José Mauricio1 aFranciscon, Uilson1 aRodrigues Soares, Marcelo Dayron0 tSoil & tillage research.g2018 Oct., v. 182 p.103-111dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl32961x0167-19877nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.still.2018.05.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02754naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245017200169300001600341520147100357592002801828650001401856650001901870650001001889650001801899650001301917650001401930650001401944650001601958650001201974650001101986650001301997650001802010650001502028700002002043700001802063700002002081700001802101773012202119856008202241852000902323655001202332IND60620353420221121224838.0200122e201809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062035342DNAL7 a10.1134/S00329452180501442doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKuzishchin, K.

In this river system with a complex geomorphology, mikizha spawns in tundra-type tributaries, and each tributary is characterized by a certain combination of size, water content, hydrological, and thermic regime. Therefore, the spawning conditions, as well as spatial distribution and biological characteristics of the progeny, are variable. Based on the mark-recapture data, mikizha intensively migrates within the river system, and it does not show any fidelity to certain sites; the spawners can enter different tributaries in various years. Based on the variation of morphometric characters, the difference between the juveniles from various tributaries is absent. The results of allozyme variation show that, despite a mosaic structure of the habitats, mikizha of the Kol River is represented by a single population with a common genofond. Based on the results of this study, it is concluded that mikizha of the Kol River is a single and highly integrated population despite the factors facilitating the diversity. A mechanism of a stable population unity is connected with the within-river migrations, and the spawners are redistributed in different tributaries of the river during each year. This redistribution is directed against the founder effect and gene drift.  aPublisher supplied data 3aallozymes 3afounder effect 3agenes 3ageomorphology 3ahabitats 3ahydrology 3ajuveniles 3amorphometry 3aprogeny 3arivers 3aspawning 3awater content 3awatersheds1 aGruzdeva, M.

The particles do not adsorb at the oil–water interface but remain dispersed in the aqueous phase between surfactant-coated droplets. A critical zeta potential of the particles of ca. +18 mV is necessary for the stabilization of the novel emulsions, suggesting that the electrical double-layer repulsions between particles and between particles and oil droplets are responsible for their stability. By bubbling N₂ into the emulsions, demulsification occurs following transformation of DDMA molecules from the surface-active cationic form to the surface-inactive neutral form and desorption from the oil–water interface. Bubbling CO₂ into the demulsified mixtures, cationic DDMA molecules are re-formed, which adsorb to the droplet interfaces, ensuring stable emulsions after homogenization. Compared with Pickering emulsions and traditional emulsions, the amount of switchable surfactant and number of like-charged particles required for stabilization are significantly reduced, which is economically and environmentally benign for practical applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaluminum oxide 3acarbon dioxide 3adesorption 3adroplets 3aemulsions 3ahomogenization 3ananoparticles 3anitrogen 3aoil-water interface 3aoils 3asurfactants 3azeta potential1 aXu, Lifei1 aLin, Qi1 aPei, Xiaomei1 aJiang, Jianzhong1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3984-66581 aZhu, Haiyan1 aCui, Zhenggang1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0006-96361 aBinks, Bernard P.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3639-80410 tLangmuir.g2019 Feb. 26, v. 35, no. 11 p.4058-4067dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19170x1520-58277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.langmuir.8b041593Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03556naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094024002200127024001900149040001800168100002800186245012200214300001100336506007600347520181600423592002802239506003702267650002202304650001402326650001102340650002102351650002502372650001402397650002102411650001902432650001502451650001102466650002102477650001902498650002602517650002902543650001202572650001902584650001002603650001902613651001802632700002202650700002702672700002002699700002002719700002002739700002902759773011402788856007902902852000902981655001202990IND60573289520221207120433.0170725e201112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057328952DNAL7 a10.1186/1472-6882-11-302doi7 aPMC30955732pmcid7 a214962452pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBright-Gbebry, Mireille10aUse of multivitamins, folic acid and herbal supplements among breast cancer survivors: the black women's health study  ap. 30.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) use, including herbals and multivitamin supplements, is quite common in the U.S., and has been shown to be highest in breast cancer survivors. However, limited data are currently available for CAM usage among African Americans. Thus, we sought to determine the prevalence of multivitamins, folic acid and herbal supplement usage in African American breast cancer survivors, and to compare the characteristics of users and nonusers. METHODS: A cohort study of breast cancer survivors, who completed the 1999 Black Women's Health Study questionnaire and self-reported having been diagnosed with breast cancer between 1995 and 1999, comprised the study population. In this study, the intake of natural herbs, multivitamins and folic acid at least three days per week within the past two years was used as a proxy for typical usage of this complimentary alternative medicine (CAM) modality. RESULTS: A total of 998 breast cancer survivors were identified. Overall, 68.2% had used either herbals or multivitamin supplements or both. The three most frequently used herbals were garlic (21.2%), gingko (12.0%), and echinacea (9.4%). The multivariate analysis determined that single marital status (OR = 1.58; 95%CI: 1.04-2.41), and alcohol consumption of 1-3 drinks per week (OR = 1.86, 95%CI: 1.28-2.68) were significantly associated with increased herbal use. Multivitamin use was significantly lower among obese women (OR = 0.66, 95%CI: 0.46-0.94) and current smokers (OR = 0.53, 95%CI: 0.34-0.82). CONCLUSIONS: A significant number of African American breast cancer survivors are using herbals and multivitamins as CAM modality. Additional research is needed to understand the impact of herbals and multivitamins in African American breast cancer survivors.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAfrican Americans 3aEchinacea 3aGinkgo 3aalcohol drinking 3aalternative medicine 3abeverages 3abreast neoplasms 3acohort studies 3afolic acid 3agarlic 3aherbal medicines 3amarital status 3amultivariate analysis 3amultivitamin supplements 3aobesity 3aquestionnaires 3awomen 3awomen's health 3aUnited States1 aMakambi, Kepher H1 aRohan, JoyAnn Phillips1 aLlanos, Adana A1 aRosenberg, Lynn1 aPalmer, Julie R1 aAdams-Campbell, Lucile L0 tBMC complementary and alternative medicine.g2011 Dec., v. 11, no. 1 p.30-30dBioMed Centralx1472-68827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1472-6882-11-303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02844naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245019600167520101900363592002801382650001901410650001601429650001301445650001601458650002901474650000901503650002701512650001401539650002001553650003101573650001001604650002101614650001001635650002101645650001001666650002301676650001501699650001201714650001501726650005301741650005301794650001701847650001501864653001101879653001001890653002101900653003201921653001301953700001701966700001801983700001802001700001802019700001502037773009502052856008602147852000902233655001202242IND60647909620221118154836.0190801e201911  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064790962DNAL7 a10.1016/j.meatsci.2019.06.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFan, Yixuan10aEffects of algae supplementation in high-energy dietary on fatty acid composition and the expression of genes involved in lipid metabolism in Hu sheep managed under intensive finishing system  aThis study aims to investigate the effect of algae supplementation in high-energy diet (HE diet) on lipid metabolism of intensive feeding sheep. The lambs were assigned to two groups and received a standard diet (ST diet, 8.40 MJ/kg) or a HE diet (9.70 MJ/kg) based on corn, wheat bran, soybean meal. Each group was divided into two subgroups: control and algae supplement (3%, DM basis). The body fat, serum cholesterol, and oleic acid in the liver and muscle increased in lambs receiving the HE diet. However, after supplementing the microalgae (Schizochytrium sp.) in the HE diet, these parameters were all reduced. In addition, EPA, DHA and CLA cis-9, trans-11 in muscle and liver increased. Algae supplementation also altered the expression of lipid metabolism-related genes, including up-regulated FADS2, ELOVL2, SCD, CPT1α and SREBF-1, and down-regulated PPARα and PPARγ. In conclusion, algae supplementation in ST and HE diets increased n-3PUFA and improved metabolic disorder caused by the HE diet.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSchizochytrium 3ablood serum 3abody fat 3acholesterol 3aconjugated linoleic acid 3acorn 3afatty acid composition 3afinishing 3agene expression 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3ahigh energy diet 3alambs 3alipid metabolism 3aliver 3ametabolic diseases 3amicroalgae 3amuscles 3aoleic acid 3aperoxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha 3aperoxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma 3asoybean meal 3awheat bran 0aMuscle 0aLiver 0aHigh-energy diet 0aPolyunsaturated fatty acids 0aHu sheep1 aRen, Caifang1 aMeng, Fanxing1 aDeng, Kaiping1 aZhang, Guomin1 aWang, Feng0 tMeat science.g2019 Nov., v. 157 p.107872-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8541x0309-17407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.meatsci.2019.06.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02624naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001500147245006800162300001600230520111100246592002801357650002001385650001801405650001401423650000901437650001701446650001301463650000901476650001101485650002201496650001601518650002801534650001901562650001001581650001101591650001501602650002101617650002601638653001401664653001201678653000801690653002201698653002001720653001301740653002701753653001801780700001401798773019101812856008202003852000902085655001202094IND60517657520221120061026.0190730e201406  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051765752DNAL7 a10.1017/S00439339140002822doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTURTOI, M.10aDecontamination of egg shells using ultraviolet light treatment  ap. 265-278.  aDecontamination of egg shells is required to improve the microbiological safety of the fresh hen eggs used for human consumption or for hatching. Conventional chemical decontamination methods involving quaternary ammonium disinfectant, sodium hydroxide, phenol, hydrogen peroxide or formaldehyde, leave residues on egg shells that may damage the cuticle layer. Therefore new techniques of egg shells decontamination, such as ultraviolet (UV) radiation, have been developed. This review aims to evaluate the data from available literature and to provide a general review of UV light treatment application for egg shell decontamination. Data shows that UV treatment was effective for the inactivation of the bacterial population present on clean egg shells and recently contaminated shells. Combined treatments such as UV light with ozone or hydrogen peroxide (H₂O₂) improved the inactivation of microorganisms. Recent advances in science and engineering indicate that treatment with UV light has a competitive advantage in comparison with traditional egg shell sanitation treatments for decontamination.  aPublisher supplied data 3adecontamination 3adisinfectants 3aegg shell 3aeggs 3aformaldehyde 3ahatching 3ahens 3ahumans 3ahydrogen peroxide 3amethodology 3amicrobiological quality 3amicroorganisms 3aozone 3aphenol 3asanitation 3asodium hydroxide 3aultraviolet radiation 0aegg shell 0achicken 0ahen 0aultraviolet light 0adecontamination 0abacteria 0aSalmonella enteritidis 0anucleic acids1 aBORDA, D.0 tWorld's poultry science journal.g2014 June, v. 70, no. 2 p.265-278dCambridge University Press on behalf of World&#x0027;s Poultry Science AssociationwJournal:jnl45575x1743-47777nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S00439339140002823Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02775naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002400147245014800171300001600319520129600335592002801631650001701659650001901676650002301695650001301718650001901731650001801750650001001768650001201778650001001790650001101800650001301811650001901824650001301843650000701856650001801863650002201881650001701903700002101920700002201941700002101963700001701984700001902001700002002020700002002040773011902060856008102179852000902260655001202269IND60124034320221120053155.0150421e201505  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012403432DNAL7 a10.1007/s11274-015-1832-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHatakeyama, Takashi10aMineralization of melamine and cyanuric acid as sole nitrogen source by newly isolated Arthrobacter spp. using a soil-charcoal perfusion method  ap. 785-793.  aMelamine belongs to the s-triazine family, and industrially used as raw product in many ways all over the world. Melamine has been reported for human harmful effects and detected from some crops, soil and water. To remove melamine from the polluted environment, the efficient melamine-mineralizing microorganisms have been needed. We newly isolated three melamine-degrading bacteria from the same upland soil sample using soil–charcoal perfusion method. These bacteria were classified as Arthrobacter sp. MCO, Arthrobacter sp. CSP and Microbacterium sp. ZEL by 16S rRNA genes sequencing analysis. Both Arthrobacter species completely degraded melamine within 2 days, and consumed melamine as a sole nitrogen source. Both strains also grew in cyanuric acid as sole nitrogen source, and released small quantities of ammonium ions. These strains are the first identified bacteria that can mineralize both melamine and cyanuric acid as sole initial nitrogen source in Arthrobacter sp. Although ammeline and ammelide intermediates were detected, these strains possess none of the known genes encoding melamine degrading enzymes. Since the Arthrobacter strains also degraded melamine in a high pH liquid medium, they present as potential bioremediation agents in melamine-polluted environments.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArthrobacter 3aMicrobacterium 3aammonium compounds 3abacteria 3abioremediation 3abiotechnology 3acrops 3aenzymes 3agenes 3ahumans 3amelamine 3amineralization 3anitrogen 3apH 3aribosomal RNA 3asequence analysis 3aupland soils1 aTakagi, Kazuhiro1 aYamazaki, Kenichi1 aSakakibara, Futa1 aItō, Kōji,1 aTakasu, Eiichi1 aNaokawa, Takuji1 aFujii, Kunihiko0 tWorld journal of microbiology & biotechnology.g2015 May, v. 31, no. 5 p.785-793dSpringer-Verlagx0959-39937nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11274-015-1832-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01853naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002100140245004900161300001800210520085600228592002801084650001401112650001701126650002301143650001001166650001401176650001801190650001001208700003401218700002301252700002201275773013501297856007401432852000901506655001201515IND60661460320221120113209.0190829e20190827xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066146032DNAL7 a10.1039/c8cs00947c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuang, Huan-Ming10aCatalytic cascade reactions by radical relay  ap. 4626-4638.  aRadical cascade reactions are an attractive tool for the rapid construction of complex molecular architectures. Although a large number of powerful radical cascades have been developed, stoichiometric amounts of reagents and/or additives are often required to mediate these processes. Radical relay strategies, in which radical character is recycled, require only a catalytic amount of reagent and are particularly attractive as they promise cascades that are high in atom economy. This tutorial review highlights recent advances in this rapidly developing area by setting out and dissecting the reaction designs underpinning state-of-the-art processes involving radical relays. Advances in the field of radical relay cascades will open the door to more efficient synthesis with far-reaching benefits for the makers and end-users of complex molecules.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadditives 3aarchitecture 3acatalytic activity 3adoors 3arecycling 3astoichiometry 3awills1 aGarduño-Castro, Monserrat H.1 aMorrill, Charlotte1 aProcter, David J.0 tChemical Society reviews.g2019 Aug. 27, v. 48, no. 17 p.4626-4638dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:20471x1460-47447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c8cs00947c3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03295naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100005400139245017400193300001800367500002000385520154100405592002801946596008601974596013102060650002002191650001602211650001602227650000902243650001002252650002002262650001802282650001602300650001702316650000902333650003002342650003502372700001602407700001602423700005702439700005402496700001602550700005402566773012302620856007302743852000902816655001202825IND60710982420221121220953.0200915e202010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071098242DNAL7 a10.1111/are.147472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChi, Meili1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3736-710810aIdentification of three SNPs in smad4 gene by tetra‐primer ARMS PCR and analysis of their associations with growth traits in gynogenetic populations of Culter alburnus  ap. 4043-4053.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThree single nucleotide polymorphisms, c.1462C > T, c.1663G > T and c.2023G > A, in smad4 gene were isolated and typed in a normal population (meio‐G0), a first‐generation gynogenetic population (meio‐G1) and a second‐generation gynogenetic population (meio‐G2) in topmouth culter (Culter alburnus) by using the tetra‐primer amplification refractory mutation system (ARMS) PCR. The homozygosity of different loci in the three populations was analysed to study the efficiency of gene purification in this fish. Correlation of the three populations to seven growth traits (body length, body weight, body thickness, body height, total length, caudal peduncle length and caudal peduncle height) was estimated. Results showed that homozygosity and homozygosity rates of three SNP loci from meio‐G0 to meio‐G2 increased obviously, and the average homozygosity of c.1462C > T and c.1663G > T loci was 0.930 and 0.880 in meio‐G2 population, which was significantly higher than that in meio‐G0 population. In the meio‐G1 and meio‐G2 populations, correlation of seven growth traits with the CC genotype was significantly higher than that with the TT and TC genotypes in the c.1462C > T locus (p < .05). These results suggested that the CC genotype in the c.1462C > T locus could be an advantage mutation that stably affects the growth of different generations of this fish. It may be used as a potential molecular marker for gene‐assisted selection to improve a range of growth traits in topmouth culter.  aPublisher supplied data  aLQ18C190001cNatural Science Foundation for Young Scientists of Zhejiang Province  a2016C02055‐1cMajor Science and Technology Programs for Agriculture (Aquaculture) New Variety Selection of Zhejiang Province 3aCulter alburnus 3abody length 3abody weight 3afish 3agenes 3agenetic markers 3agrowth traits 3agynogenesis 3ahomozygosity 3aloci 3apolymerase chain reaction 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism1 aJia, Yongyi1 aYu, Junjian1 aZheng, Jianbo1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6795-02521 aLiu, Shili1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3929-649X1 aCheng, Shun1 aGu, Zhimin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1849-87030 tAquaculture research.g2020 Oct., v. 51, no. 10 p.4043-4053dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl53865x1355-557X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/are.147473Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02597naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100001700166245012300183300001600306520112000322592002801442650002701470650001601497650001301513650002601526650001001552650001101562650001301573650001701586650001301603650001301616650002401629650001201653650004001665650002801705650002001733650005001753650001101803650002801814650004901842700001301891700001301904700001301917700001801930773008601948856004802034852000902082655001202091IND50069566320221120181603.0130928e201310  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006956632DNAL7 a238132492pmid7 a10.1007/s11262-013-0943-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Shihua10aIdentification of a conserved B-cell epitope in the equine arteritis virus (EAV) N protein using the pepscan technique  ap. 292-297.  aThe nucleocapsid (N) gene of equine arteritis virus (EAV) is highly conserved between isolates, and the N protein is an important antigen that induces immunity when horses are infected with EAV. This study describes the identification of a linear B-cell epitope on the N protein using the pepscan technique with a monoclonal antibody (mAb) 2B1 directed against the N protein. The N protein was divided into 11 overlapping peptides, each containing 16 amino acids associated with six overlapping amino acids. The fragments were expressed as MBP fusion proteins that were then used to probe the 2B1 mAb. The minimal epitope sequence was confirmed step-by-step using single amino acid residue deletion. One completely conserved linear epitope (³⁸KPPAQP⁴³) was identified that matched with EAV-positive serum in Western blots, thereby revealing the importance of these six amino acids of the epitope for antibody-epitope binding activity. This finding not only contributes to our understanding of the antigenic structure of the N protein of EAV but also has potential for the development of diagnostic techniques.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEquine arteritis virus 3aamino acids 3aantigens 3adiagnostic techniques 3agenes 3ahorses 3aimmunity 3anucleocapsid 3apeptides 3aproteins 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAnimals 2aEquartevirusxgeneticsximmunology. 2aDNA Mutational Analysis 2aEpitope Mapping 2aEpitopes, B-Lymphocytexgeneticsximmunology. 2aHorses 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aNucleocapsid Proteinsxgeneticsximmunology.1 aQi, Ting1 aGuo, Wei1 aLu, Gang1 aXiang, Wenhua0 tVirus genes.g2013 Oct., v. 47, no. 2 p.292-297dSpringer-Verlagx0920-85697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11262-013-0943-x  aDNAL 7aarticle02535naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002200151245013200173300001300305520108800318592002801406650001701434650002301451650002501474650001501499650001501514650001501529650002701544650002301571650001201594650002601606650001701632650002201649653002601671653001101697653002101708653002301729653002701752653001801779700001801797700001901815700002401834773011301858856008501971852000902056655001202065IND60631504220221122095509.0190226e20190102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063150422DNAL7 a10.1080/08941920.2018.14895682doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMizrahi, Me’ira12aA Systematic Review of the Socioeconomic Factors that Influence How Marine Protected Areas Impact on Ecosystems and Livelihoods  ap. 4-20.  aMarine protected areas (MPAs) are among the most widely accepted methods of marine management. MPAs are not, however, always placed such that they can maximize impact on conservation and livelihoods. Current MPA guidelines fall short in focusing primarily on biophysical criteria, overlooking interrelated socioeconomic factors. We identified 32 socioeconomic factors that influence whether MPA placement has an impact on biodiversity and/or livelihoods and weighted the quality of evidence using a novel “Evidence for Impact” Score. Results suggest that stakeholder engagement, poverty, population density, and strong leadership have most potential to positively impact biodiversity and/or livelihoods, but the direction of impact (i.e., positive or negative) can be context-dependent. We found a generally poor evidence base for impact evaluation of socioeconomic factors: though some factors were highly cited, few studies actually evaluate impact. Results indicate the need for a more interdisciplinary approach to MPA placement and more empirical studies that assess impact.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiodiversity 3aempirical research 3aenvironmental impact 3aguidelines 3aleadership 3alivelihood 3amarine protected areas 3apopulation density 3apoverty 3asocioeconomic factors 3astakeholders 3asystematic review 0aConservation planning 0aimpact 0amarine fisheries 0amarine livelihoods 0amarine protected areas 0asocioeconomic1 aDiedrich, Amy1 aWeeks, Rebecca1 aPressey, Robert L.,0 tSociety & natural resources.g2019 Jan. 2, v. 32, no. 1 p.4-20dRoutledgewJournal:jnl45063x1521-07237nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/08941920.2018.14895683Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02258naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002500139245012400164300001600288520111300304592002801417650002401445650001801469650001901487650000901506650001601515650001001531650001401541650002401555650001201579650001101591650002201602651001001624700001701634700001401651773012501665856007301790852000901863655001201872IND60466723720221122033032.0151127e201512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6046672372DNAL7 a10.1111/fme.121562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCarter‐Lynn, K. P.10aPopulation characteristics of channel catfish near the northern edge of their distribution: implications for management  ap. 530-538.  aChannel catfish, Ictalurus punctatus (Rafinesque), populations in six lakes in northern Idaho, USA, were sampled to describe their population characteristics. During the summers of 2011 and 2012, 4864 channel catfish were sampled. Channel catfish populations had low to moderate catch rates, and length structure was dominated by fish <400 mm. Channel catfish were in good body condition. All populations were maintained by stocking age‐1 or age‐2 fish. Growth of fish reared in thermally enriched environments prior to stocking was fast compared to other North American channel catfish populations. After stocking, growth of channel catfish declined rapidly. Once stocked, cold water temperatures, prey resources and (or) genetic capabilities limited growth. Total annual mortality of age 2 and older channel catfish was generally <40%. Tag returns indicated that angler exploitation was low, varying from 0 to 43% among lakes. This research provides insight on factors regulating channel catfish population dynamics and highlights important considerations associated with their ecology and management.  aPublisher supplied data 3aIctalurus punctatus 3aanimal growth 3abody condition 3acold 3afarmed fish 3alakes 3amortality 3apopulation dynamics 3arearing 3asummer 3awater temperature 3aIdaho1 aQuist, M.

The problem can be managed by complementing the use of Fe-efficient plant type with a suitable Fe management strategy. In the present paper, we report the effect of eight iron management practices to resolve the problem of iron (Fe) chlorosis through the use of an iron deficiency tolerant (IDTR) and iron deficiency susceptible (IDSR) rice genotype, i.e. Pusa 33 and ADT 39, respectively. Fe deficiency tolerance of these genotypes was related to the root release of PS which enabled a higher uptake of Fe in the IDTR than the IDSR under Fe deficiency. In general, IDTR performed better than the IDSR as evident from a significant increase in total iron, active iron, chlorophyll content and grain and straw yield. IDSR produced the highest grain and straw yield under slow iron release nano clay complex source. Grain Fe content of the IDTR and IDSR increased by 18.9 and 13.4%, respectively, under recommended dose of Fe. The results identified the most effective soil management strategies for the alleviating Fe deficiency chlorosis and improving Fe nutrition of both IDTR and IDSR genotypes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aInceptisols 3aOryza sativa 3achlorophyll 3achlorosis 3aclay 3agenotype 3airon 3anutrient deficiencies 3anutritive value 3arice 3asoil management 3astraw 0aAerobic rice 0achlorophyll content 0aFe deficiency 0arice genotypes 0aleaf greenness index (SPAD)1 aPandey, Raghu Nath1 aSingh, Bhupinder1 aSingh, Geeta1 aMeena, Mahesh Chand1 aDatta, Samar C.1 aPradhan, Sanatan1 aMeena, Amrit Lal0 tArchiv für Acker- und Pflanzenbau und Bodenkunde.g2019 Aug. 24, v. 65, no. 10 p.1387-1400dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl4585x1476-35677nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03650340.2019.15667093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03062naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002600147245014700173300001800320520169800338592002802036650002402064650001502088650001602103650002402119650001402143650002002157650004402177650002202221650001302243650001202256650001802268650001402286650001202300650001202312650001302324700001602337700002402353700002202377700002002399700002202419773010602441856004802547852000902595655001202604IND50066025120221123033403.0130428e201306  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006602512DNAL7 a10.1007/s11947-012-0818-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSantagapita, Patricio10aModification of Transverse NMR Relaxation Times and Water Diffusion Coefficients of Kiwifruit Pericarp Tissue Subjected to Osmotic Dehydration  ap. 1434-1443.  aThe objective of the present study was to evaluate cellular compartment modifications of kiwifruit (Actinidia deliciosa) outer pericarp tissue caused by osmotic treatment in a 61.5 % sucrose solution, through the quantification of transverse relaxation time (T ₂) and water self-diffusion coefficient (D w) obtained by low field nuclear magnetic resonance means. Raw material ripening stage was taken into account as an osmotic dehydration (OD) process variable by analyzing two different kiwifruit groups, low (LB) and high (HB) °Brix. Three T ₂ values were obtained of about 20, 310, and 1,250 ms, which could be ascribed to the proton populations, located in the cell walls, in the cytoplasm/extracellular space, and in the vacuoles, respectively. According to T ₂ intensity values, vacuole protons represented between 47 and 60 % of the total kiwifruit protons, for LB and HB kiwifruits, respectively. The leakage of water leading to vacuole shrinkage seemed to cause concentration of solutes, retained by the tonoplast, making the vacuole T ₂ value decrease along the OD. As expected, the D w values of raw kiwifruits were lower than the value of the free pure water. The water mobility (and hence D w), depending on the kiwifruit distinctive cellular structures and solutes, decreased even more during OD due to water loss and sugar gain phenomena. D w represents an average value of the diffusion coefficient of the whole kiwifruit tissue protons. In order to obtain D w values specific for each cellular compartment, a multiple component model fitting was also used. According to these results, the vacuole water self-diffusion coefficient (D w,ᵥ) was much higher than D w.  aPublisher supplied data 3aActinidia deliciosa 3acell walls 3adiffusivity 3aextracellular space 3akiwifruit 3amagnetic fields 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aosmotic treatment 3apericarp 3aprotons 3araw materials 3ashrinkage 3asolutes 3asucrose 3avacuoles1 aLaghi, Luca1 aPanarese, Valentina1 aTylewicz, Urszula1 aRocculi, Pietro1 aRosa, Marco Dalla0 tFood and bioprocess technology.g2013 June, v. 6, no. 6 p.1434-1443dSpringer-Verlagx1935-51307nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11947-012-0818-5  aDNAL 7aarticle02648naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002200151245008700173300001800260520140200278592002801680650000901708650002001717650001401737650001601751650002701767650001501794650003001809653003801839653002701877653002301904653004401927653004101971700002002012773014802032856008502180852000902265655001202274IND60644793120190906000000.0190522e20190824xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064479312DNAL7 a10.1080/03650340.2019.15667102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCastellini, Mirko10aPedotransfer functions for estimating soil water retention curve of Sicilian soils  ap. 1401-1416.  aPedotransfer functions (PTFs) make use of routinely surveyed soil data to estimate soil properties but their application to soils different from those used for their development can yield inaccurate estimates. This investigation aimed at evaluating the water retention prediction accuracy of eight existing PTFs using a database of 217 Sicilian soils exploring 11 USDA textural classes. PTFs performance was assessed by root mean square differences (RMSD) and average differences (AD) between estimated and measured data. Extended Nonlinear Regression (ENR) technique was adopted to recalibrate or develop four new PTFs and Wind’s evaporation method was applied to validate the effectiveness of the relationships proposed. PTFs evaluation resulted in RMSD and AD values in the range 0.0630–0.0972 and 0.0021–0.0618 cm³ cm–³, respectively. Best and worst performances were obtained respectively by PTF-MI and PTF-ZW. ENR allowed to recalibrate PTF-MI and PTF-ZW with improvements of RMSD (0.0594 and 0.0508 cm³ cm–³) and to develop two relationships that improved RMSD by 75–78% as compared to PTF-MI. The results confirmed the potential of ENR technique in calibrating existing PTFs or developing new ones. Validation conducted with an independent dataset suggested that recalibrated/developed PTFs represent a viable alternative for water retention estimation of Sicilian soils.  aPublisher supplied data 3aUSDA 3adata collection 3adatabases 3aevaporation 3apedotransfer functions 3aprediction 3asoil water characteristic 0aParametric pedotransfer functions 0awater retention models 0aevaporation method 0aextended nonlinear regression technique 0apedotransfer functions recalibration1 aIovino, Massimo0 tArchiv für Acker- und Pflanzenbau und Bodenkunde.g2019 Aug. 24, v. 65, no. 10 p.1401-1416dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl4585x1476-35677nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03650340.2019.15667103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02114naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001800139245009600157300001600253520109500269592002801364650001601392650001801408650001801426650000901444650001601453650001101469650001401480650001101494650002101505651001201526700001901538773012501557856007301682852000901755655001201764IND60466723920221122043848.0151127e201512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6046672392DNAL7 a10.1111/fme.121552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHakala, J.

These data were used with an age‐structured model to assess performance of a 356‐mm minimum length limit (MLL), a 406‐mm MLL and a 330‐ to 406‐mm protected slot length limit (SLL) compared to the present harvest regulation of no MLL. Mean annual exploitation varied from 12 to 22% each year and was generally highest for fish > 330 mm; total annual mortality was 44%. Models predicted a 49–153% increase in numbers of Alabama bass reaching 432 mm, a 22–66% decline in numbers harvested and only moderate declines in yield (5–25%) with the alternative harvest regulations compared to current conditions. The SLL may be an acceptable compromise to allow Allatoona Reservoir anglers to still harvest fish while also improving Alabama bass size structure.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMicropterus 3aage structure 3aanimal growth 3abass 3abody length 3amodels 3amortality 3aspring 3awater reservoirs 3aGeorgia1 aSammons, S.

Adipocyte fatty acid‐binding protein (A‐FABP, FABP4) is a relevant mediator of lipid metabolism and several comorbidities development. Aim of the study was to explore the possible role of FABP4 in psoriasis and assess its relationship with disease activity, inflammation or metabolic disturbances, and impact of systemic treatment. Fasting blood samples were obtained from 33 patients with active plaque‐type psoriasis before and after 12 weeks of therapy and from 11 healthy volunteers. Serum FABP4 concentrations were analyzed by the enzyme‐linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and statistically analyzed for their correlations with clinical outcomes and the treatment introduced. Serum FABP4 levels were significantly increased in psoriatics compared to controls (p = 0.03). No relationship between the protein and psoriasis severity expressed through psoriasis area and severity index (PASI) was noted (p = 0.57). FABP4 did not correlate with CRP (p = 0.41), lipid profile, and body mass index (BMI) nor the glucose level or liver enzyme activity. FABP4 significantly correlated with morphotic blood elements. After total therapy, FABP4 did not statistically change (p = 0.07), but significantly decreased after administering acitretin (p = 0.03). FABP4 is a potential marker of psoriasis and clinical outcome after therapy with acitretin. Adipocyte‐type FABP may be related to hematological disorders or obesity‐mediated comorbidities in psoriasis.  aPublisher supplied data  aProject No: N/ST/MN/17/002/1149cMedical University of Bialystok 3aadipocytes 3ablood serum 3abody mass index 3aenzyme activity 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3afatty acid-binding proteins 3aglucose 3ainflammation 3alipid composition 3alipid metabolism 3aliver 3ametabolic syndrome 3apsoriasis 3atherapeutics1 aKiluk, Paulina1 aŚwiderska, Magdalena1 aMaciaszek, Magdalena1 aMyśliwiec, Hanna1 aFlisiak, Iwona0 tLipids.g2019 Aug., v. 54, no. 8 p.445-452dJohn Wiley & Sons, Inc.wJournal:jnl46279x0024-42017nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/lipd.121733Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03402naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001500145245021700160300002000377520153800397592002801935596011101963650001202074650002702086650001702113650001602130650002202146650001302168650001502181650001902196650002002215650001502235650001202250650001902262650001602281653003502297653002502332653005002357653001902407653002902426700005702455700005202512700005302564700006002617773014202677856008002819852000902899655001202908IND60783233220221118060900.0220719e20220629xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078323322DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.est.2c011402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGan, Qimao10aCosolvent-Assisted Interfacial Polymerization toward Regulating the Morphology and Performance of Polyamide Reverse Osmosis Membranes: Increased m-Phenylenediamine Solubility or Enhanced Interfacial Vaporization?  ap. 10308-10316.  aCosolvent-assisted interfacial polymerization (IP) can effectively enhance the separation performance of thin film composite (TFC) reverse osmosis (RO) membranes. However, the underlying mechanisms regulating the formation of their polyamide (PA) rejection films remain controversial. The current study reveals two essential roles of cosolvents in the IP reaction: (1) directly promoting interfacial vaporization with their lower boiling points and (2) increasing the solubility of m-phenylenediamine (MPD) in the organic phase, thereby indirectly promoting the IP reaction. Using a series of systematically chosen cosolvents (i.e., diethyl ether, acetone, methanol, and toluene) with different boiling points and MPD solubilities, we show that the surface morphologies of TFC RO membranes were regulated by the combined direct and indirect effects. A cosolvent favoring interfacial vaporization (e.g., lower boiling point, greater MPD solubility, and/or higher concentration) tends to create greater apparent thickness of the rejection layer, larger nanovoids within the layer, and more extensive exterior PA layers, leading to significantly improved membrane water permeance. We further demonstrate the potential to achieve better antifouling performance for the cosolvent-assisted TFC membranes. The current study provides mechanistic insights into the critical roles of cosolvents in IP reactions, providing new tools for tailoring membrane morphology and separation properties toward more efficient desalination and water reuse.  aPublisher supplied data  aSRFS2021-7S04cResearch Grants Council, University Grants Committeedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100002920 3aacetone 3aantifouling activities 3adesalination 3aethyl ether 3afilms (materials) 3amethanol 3apolyamides 3apolymerization 3areverse osmosis 3asolubility 3atoluene 3avolatilization 3awater reuse 0areverse osmosis (RO) membranes 0apolyamide morphology 0acosolvent-assisted interfacial polymerization 0aMPD solubility 0ainterfacial vaporization1 aPeng, Lu Elfa1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3223-46081 aGuo, Hao1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0688-54311 aYang, Zhe1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0753-39021 aTang, Chuyang Y.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7932-64620 tEnvironmental science & technology.g2022 June 29, v. 56, no. 14 p.10308-10316dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23339x1520-58517nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.2c011403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03448naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245011000164300001600274520186800290592002802158650001902186650002702205650001002232650002402242650002602266650002002292650001102312650001502323650001402338650001102352650002002363650002302383650001002406650001202416650001802428651001202446653001902458653001202477653002002489653002002509653002202529653001802551653001102569653002002580700002002600700001602620773019102636856008202827852000902909655001202918IND60517658220221120052000.0190730e201406  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051765822DNAL7 a10.1017/S004393391400035X2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTUYTTENS, F.10aBroiler production in Flanders, Belgium: current situation and producers’ opinions about animal welfare  ap. 343-354.  aThe aim of this paper is to provide up-to-date information about the status of broiler production in Flanders (the northern region of Belgium) and the opinion of Flemish broiler producers on animal welfare. Our review revealed that intensification of Flemish broiler production has continued, as characterised by a decreasing number of production plants with up-scaled production. Results of a quantitative survey of Flemish broiler producers showed that the typical broiler house is 21 years old and houses 35,000 mixed-sex Ross broilers indoors on wood shavings or straw. The commonly-used modal management implies thinning one-fifth of the flock at the age of 35 days. The remaining broilers are slaughtered when they are 42 days old and weigh an average of 2.4 kg. The median unassisted mortality rate is 2% and another 0.5% are culled. Further scaling-up of production units is not viewed favourably by producers, particularly as related to consumer acceptance. Producers state they place great importance on animal welfare and do not agree that broiler welfare is poor. A small minority of producers plan to invest in improving broiler welfare in the near future. They see few advantages in paying more attention to broiler welfare or providing outdoor access to improve their public image and consumer acceptance. Producers define animal welfare mainly in terms of good health, feeding and housing and consider aspects that relate to the birds’ ability to express appropriate behaviour as less important. We discuss how this concept of ‘animal welfare’ corresponds to that reported by other people with farming backgrounds. Unfortunately this belief contradicts the perception of citizens and consumers and the assumptions underlying the proposed European standards for monitoring farm animal welfare as developed by the Welfare Quality® consortium.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal welfare 3aattitudes and opinions 3abirds 3aconsumer acceptance 3afarmed animal species 3afarming systems 3aflocks 3amonitoring 3amortality 3apeople 3apoultry housing 3apoultry production 3astraw 3asurveys 3awood shavings 3aBelgium 0aanimal welfare 0aBelgium 0abroiler chicken 0afarmer attitude 0aproduction system 0aquestionnaire 0asurvey 0awelfare quality1 aVANHONACKER, F.1 aVERBEKE, W.0 tWorld's poultry science journal.g2014 June, v. 70, no. 2 p.343-354dCambridge University Press on behalf of World&#x0027;s Poultry Science AssociationwJournal:jnl45575x1743-47777nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S004393391400035X3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02729naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002600147245007500173300001400248520149200262592002801754650002001782650001501802650000901817650001901826650001701845650002501862650001501887650002101902653003301923653002101956653002501977653002802002653001002030653001502040700001802055700001802073700003202091773009402123856008102217852000902298655001202307IND60545042920221119145426.0160901e201501  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054504292DNAL7 a10.1016/j.rse.2014.09.0192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRios, Ricardo Araújo10aEstimating determinism rates to detect patterns in geospatial datasets  ap. 11-20.  aThe analysis of temporal geospatial data has provided important insights into global vegetation dynamics, particularly the interaction among different variables such as precipitation and vegetation indices. Nevertheless, this analysis is not a straightforward task due to the complex relationships among different systems driving the dynamics of the observed variables. Aiming at automatically extracting information from temporal geospatial data, we propose a new approach to detect stochastic and deterministic patterns embedded into time series and illustrate its effectiveness through an analysis of global geospatial precipitation and vegetation data captured over a 14 year period. By knowing such patterns, we can find similarities in the behavior of different systems even if these systems are characterized by different dynamics. In addition, we developed a novel determinism measure to evaluate the relative contribution of stochastic and deterministic patterns in a time series. Analyses showed that this measure permitted the detection of regions on the global map where the radiation absorbed by the vegetation and the incidence of rain occur with similar patterns of stochasticity. The methods developed in this study are generally applicable to any spatiotemporal data set and may be of particular interest for the analysis of the vast amount of remotely sensed geospatial data currently being collected routinely as part of national and international monitoring programs.  aPublisher supplied data 3adata collection 3amonitoring 3arain 3aremote sensing 3aspatial data 3atime series analysis 3avegetation 3avegetation index 0aEmpirical mode decomposition 0aDeterminism rate 0aTime series analysis 0aSpatiotemporal analysis 0aFAPAR 0aVegetation1 aParrott, Lael1 aLange, Holger1 aMello, Rodrigo Fernandes de0 tRemote sensing of environment.g2015 Jan., v. 156 p.11-20dElsevier Inc.x0034-42577nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rse.2014.09.0193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02892naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245005800170300001600228520137300244592002801617650001401645650002501659650002101684650001701705650002001722650002401742650001401766650002001780650002501800650001901825650001801844650001001862650001401872650000901886653003001895653003601925653002701961653003501988653003302023700001302056700001602069700001502085700001602100773019102116856008202307852000902389655001202398IND60517658320221123045231.0190730e201406  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051765832DNAL7 a10.1017/S00439339140003612doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSHAHID MAHMOOD, M.14aThe development of hydropericardium syndrome vaccines  ap. 355-364.  aHydropericardium syndrome (HPS) is a fatal disease of broiler chickens causing high mortality and heavy economic losses in various countries. More than 100 million birds have been affected by this destructive disease in less than two years worldwide. As it is a viral disease, the only solution is to vaccinate chickens. Different types of vaccines are being used against this disease in different areas of the world. Liver organ inactivated vaccines are more extensively used to control the disease initially. These vaccines have many drawbacks regarding their dose, un-predictable immune response and secondary bacterial infections. Following this, oil adjuvant vaccine was used to control the disease, however the handling stress and the formation of granuloma at the site of injection remains a problem. Consequently there is a need for cell culture adapted and attenuated vaccines, which can be administered through oral routes. A chicken embryo-adapted inactivated vaccine has shown good results but requires a continuous supply of specific, pathogen-free chicken embryos and a continuous life killing process. The continuous cell lines are a more promising solution for the production of cell culture-adapted and attenuated vaccines, which are safer, more economical and easy to administer. The following review discusses the development of modern HPS vaccines.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadjuvants 3abacterial infections 3abroiler chickens 3acell culture 3adisease control 3afinancial economics 3agranuloma 3aimmune response 3ainactivated vaccines 3ainjection site 3alive vaccines 3aliver 3amortality 3aoils 0ahydropericardium syndrome 0aliver organ inactivated vaccine 0aoil adjuvanted vaccine 0achicken embryo adapted vaccine 0acell culture adapted vaccine1 aAli, S.,1 aHUSSAIN, I.1 aAslam, A.,1 aRAFIQUE, A.0 tWorld's poultry science journal.g2014 June, v. 70, no. 2 p.355-364dCambridge University Press on behalf of World&#x0027;s Poultry Science AssociationwJournal:jnl45575x1743-47777nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S00439339140003613Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03427naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094024002700124024003400151040001800185100006300203245009800266300001800364500002000382506002800402506003000430520163500460592002802095596004502123506003702168650002902205650002302234650002402257650001202281650002302293650002002316650001302336650002002349650001802369650001202387650001202399650001402411650001002425650001702435650001602452650001602468650001402484700006502498700005702563700002202620773012702642856007302769903002202842852000902864655001202873IND60608868520221207095559.0180813e201809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060886852DNAL7 a10.1111/jfd.128332chorus7 a10.1111/jfd.128332doi7 a10.1111/jfd.128332chorusOpen  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShoemaker, Craig A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5478-120X10aInfluence of native catfish mucus on Flavobacterium columnare growth and proteolytic activity  ap. 1395-1402.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aResource is Open Access  aWiley License Information  aFlavobacterium columnare causes columnaris disease of farmed and wild freshwater fish. Skin mucus is an important factor in early stages of columnaris pathogenesis, albeit little studied. Our objectives were to (a) characterize the terminal glycosylation pattern (TGP) of catfish mucus, (b) determine the growth of F. columnare in formulated water (FW)‐containing channel catfish (Ictalurus punctatus) or hybrid catfish (Ictalurus punctatus X Ictalurus furcatus) mucus and (c) examine extracellular protease activity of two F. columnare isolates differing in virulence. The TGP of catfish mucus by lectin binding was as follows: alpha‐D‐mannose/alpha‐D‐glucose >N‐acetyl‐beta‐D‐glucosamine >N‐acetyl‐beta‐D‐glucosamine/N‐acetylneuraminic acid >N‐acetyl‐D‐galactosamine >alpha‐D‐galactose/N‐acetyl‐alpha‐D‐galactosamine >beta‐D‐galactose = alpha‐L‐fucose. Virulence studies demonstrated isolate AL‐02‐36 was highly virulent in channel catfish fry (0.1 g) with cumulative mortality of 90%‐100% versus 60% for isolate ALG‐00‐530 at equivalent doses (~3 × 10⁶ CFU/ml); a similar result was observed in larger (0.7 g) catfish. In multiple experiments, F. columnare replicated (2‐3 logs) and survived (28 days) in formulated water‐containing catfish mucus. Highly virulent isolate AL‐02‐36 possessed at least 2.5‐ to fivefold higher protease activity following growth in mucus than the less virulent ALG‐00‐530. Flavobacterium columnare utilized catfish mucus as a nutrient source and mucus presence modulated extracellular protease production.  aPublisher supplied data  cUSDAdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/1000001990 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aFlavobacterium columnare 3aIctalurus furcatus 3aIctalurus punctatus 3acatfish 3acolumnaris disease 3aenzyme activity 3afish fry 3afreshwater fish 3aglycosylation 3ahybrids 3alectins 3amortality 3amucus 3apathogenesis 3aproteinases 3aproteolysis 3avirulence1 aLaFrentz, Benjamin R.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7358-51081 aPeatman, Eric1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0634-72511 aBeck, Benjamin H.0 tJournal of fish diseases.g2018 Sept., v. 41, no. 9 p.1395-1402dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl10108x0140-77757nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jfd.128333Available from publisher's site  aVersion of Record  aDNAL 7aarticle02314naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001300147245012100160300001600281520122700297592002801524650001801552650001901570650001101589650001401600650001301614650001601627653002201643653002301665653002801688700001601716700001701732773012501749856008101874852000901955655001201964IND60569015820221119170432.0190318e20170915xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056901582DNAL7 a10.1016/j.lwt.2017.05.0262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIftiqar,10aEnrichment of β-carotene from palm oil using supercritical carbon dioxide pretreatment-solvent extraction technique  ap. 262-266.  aEnriching natural 10 g/100 g β-carotene concentrate further is both meaningful and challenging issue. In this paper, a two-step technique has been reported to boost the concentration of natural β-carotene. Supercritical carbon dioxide (SC-CO2) was utilized to preconcentrate 10 g/100 g β-carotene made from crude palm oil followed with a solvent extraction. In the first step, the β-carotene concentration was preconcentrated to 16.7 g/100 g from 10 g/100 g when pretreating conditions were as follows: extraction temperature 60 °C, extraction pressure 20 MPa, extraction time 3 h, and CO2 flow rate 22 kg/h, In the second step, the β-carotene was boosted to 58.7 g/100 g from 16.7 g/100 g when the ratio of the preconcentrated sample and n-hexane solvent was 4:200 (g:mL), and the processing temperature was −5 °C. This is attributed to that SC-CO2 was able selectively to remove the impurities such as oil fraction. Removing impurities enable further purification of the beta-carotene with hexane extraction. The pretreatment of removing oil fraction using supercritical (SC-CO2) plays a vital role in the enrichment of β-carotene from 10 g/100 g β-carotene concentrates to higher content.  aPublisher supplied data 3abeta-carotene 3acarbon dioxide 3ahexane 3apalm oils 3asolvents 3atemperature 0aSupercritical CO2 0aSolvent extraction 0aβ-carotene concentrate1 aTan, Huijun1 aZhao, Yaping0 tLebensmittel-Wissenschaft + Technologie.g2017 Sept. 15, v. 83 p.262-266dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl1644x0023-64387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lwt.2017.05.0263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03598naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001800149245015600167300001400323520194000337592002802277650002102305650001202326650002202338650000902360650002702369650000902396650001302405650001302418650000802431650002202439650003202461650003202493650003202525650001402557650001002571650002202581650001002603650002302613651002102636653002102657653001202678653001602690653001302706653002202719700001902741700001802760700002202778700002102800773013002821856008402951852000903035655001203044IND60539617520221119230133.0190318e201401  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053961752DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jembe.2013.10.0242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBanks, Janaya10aCombining bio-logging and fatty acid signature analysis indicates spatio-temporal variation in the diet of the southern elephant seal, Mirounga leonina  ap. 79-90.  aQuantifying the foraging ecology of apex predators is crucial for understanding the predator–prey interactions in marine ecosystems. This is particularly important in the Southern Ocean ecosystem, where year-round studies are logistically and financially impractical. Detailed investigations into the diet of wide-ranging southern hemisphere marine predators, therefore, need to be quantified spatio-temporally. We coupled tracking data with fatty acid signature analysis (FASA) to investigate the foraging ecology of a wide-ranging Southern Ocean marine predator, the southern elephant seal (Mirounga leonina). Seal foraging areas varied spatially and over time, but seals concentrated their activities in three broad geographic regions (i) off the East Antarctic Continental Shelf (S-ACC), (ii) at the edge of the pack ice north of the Ross Sea (SE-RS) and (iii) north of the Sub-Antarctic Front (SE-SAF). There were significant differences in the fatty acid (FA) composition of the blubber from the seals that used these different regions. Seals foraging in the SE-SAF had blubber high in short chained mono-unsaturated fatty acids (SC-MUFAs), compared to those from the S-ACC and SE-RS habitats, which contained more poly-unsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs). Comparisons with FAs of known prey species in the region indicated that blubber collected from seals using the shelf and pelagic habitats (i.e. S-ACC and SE-SAF) were likely to have higher proportions of fish in the diet and, conversely, those from the pack-ice habitat (i.e. SE-RS) were more likely to have a cosmopolitan diet, i.e. an evenly mixed diet of fish and squid. Seal diet also varied annually, within the shelf and pelagic habitats changing from a diet relatively high in fish, to a diet relatively high in squid. Coupling tracking data with FASA is a powerful technique to investigate the spatio-temporal variations in the diet of wide-ranging marine predators.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMirounga leonina 3ablubber 3acontinental shelf 3adiet 3afatty acid composition 3afish 3aforaging 3ahabitats 3aice 3amarine ecosystems 3amonounsaturated fatty acids 3apolyunsaturated fatty acids 3apredator-prey relationships 3apredators 3aseals 3aspatial variation 3asquid 3atemporal variation 3aAntarctic region 0aAnnual variation 0aBlubber 0aFatty acids 0aForaging 0aSpatial variation1 aLea, Mary-Anne1 aWall, Stephen1 aMcMahon, Clive R.1 aHindell, Mark A.0 tJournal of experimental marine biology and ecology.g2014 Jan., v. 450 p.79-90dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11705x0022-09817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jembe.2013.10.0243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03378naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005900148245017200207300002000379520139700399592002801796596007001824650004201894650002201936650002501958650002601983650001902009650001402028650001202042650001002054650002102064650002302085650001002108650001502118650002102133650001702154650001402171650001302185650001702198650001902215650001302234650001402247700002502261700002302286700001702309700002502326700001902351700001702370700001302387700002402400700002702424700002602451700002502477700001602502773015402518856008302672852000902755655001202764IND60777133120221117225953.0220514e202205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077713312DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-021-17854-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYankey, Richard1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2661-392410aMetabolic properties, gene functions, and biosafety analysis reveal the action of three rhizospheric plant growth-promoting bacteria of Jujuncao (Pennisetum giganteum)  ap. 38435-38449.  aThis study aimed to identify the specific genes associated with plant growth promotion and cadmium tolerance in three bacteria strains associated with Pennisetum giganteum as well as to determine their biosafety levels in their potential use as biofertilizers for promoting plant growth and phytoremediation activities. The plant growth-promoting (PGP) abilities of Enterobacter cloacae strain RCB980 (A3), Klebsiella pneumonia strain kpa (A4), and Klebsiella sp. strain XT-2 (A7) were determined by a growth promotion trial and through testing for PGP traits such as 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC) deaminase enzyme production, phosphorus solubilization, siderophore synthesis, and indole-3 acetic acid (IAA) production. The genes that potentially contribute to the beneficial activities of these three strains were identified through an analysis of their genomes. To establish the biosafety of the candidate PGPB, a pathological study was undertaken whereby 20 Kunming mice were injected intraperitoneally to study and analyze the effects of the strains on growth and lung paraffin sections of the mice. The strains had no obvious toxicity effect on the tested mice and were therefore not considered as highly virulent strains. These strains are thus considered non-toxic, safe, and highly recommended for use in environmental remediation strategies and agricultural production.  aPublisher supplied data  a2018L3003cfujian provincial department of science and technology 3a1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid 3aCenchrus caudatus 3aEnterobacter cloacae 3aKlebsiella pneumoniae 3abiofertilizers 3abiosafety 3acadmium 3agenes 3agrowth promotion 3aindole acetic acid 3alungs 3aphosphorus 3aphytoremediation 3aplant growth 3apollution 3aresearch 3asiderophores 3asolubilization 3atoxicity 3avirulence1 aOmoor, Ibrahim N.

The analysis reveals that even in a generally medium-sized city as Ioannina (120,000 habitants), PM₁₀ levels exceed the European Union’s standards (mean daily PM₁₀<50 μg/m³) quite often during the cold period of the year. The diurnal and intra-annual patterns of PM₁₀ indicate that road traffic and residential heating are the main contributors of PM₁₀ in the city, while residential heating is the main contributor during the cold period of the year, leading to very high concentrations (80 μg/m³) around 10 p.m. The inter-annual variation over the study period 2010–2012 and 2014–2017, constrained by the availability of quality surface PM₁₀ measurements, shows that apart from meteorological parameters (e.g., wind speed, rain, and daily minimum temperature), which are significantly correlated with PM₁₀, social-economic factors also determine the levels of atmospheric particulate matter. Indeed, during the years of deep austerity, in the middle of the study period, the number of days with poor and very poor conditions, defined according to the European Air Quality Index, has increased. This resulted from a decrease of consumption of conventional fuels for residential heating (e.g., oil) and the strengthened use of alternative and cheaper solutions such as wood or pellet burning, which emit more particulate matter.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEuropean Union 3aair 3aair quality 3acold 3aheat 3aoils 3aparticulates 3arain 3asoil pollution 3atemperature 3atraffic 3awater 3awind speed 3awood 3aGreece1 aHatzianastassiou, N.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6119-17931 aMarkozannes, G.1 aRizos, E.

Different responses of Se biomarkers after supplementation with selenomethionine and sodium selenite have been observed and some of them could be due to genetic polymorphisms, mainly single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Brazil nuts are known to be the richest natural source of Se.Investigate how genetic variations in selenoprotein genes modulate biomarkers of Se status in response to Brazil nut supplementation.The SU.BRA.NUT study was a four month interventional trial which involved healthy volunteers of both genders, selected in University of Sao Paulo. The supplementation was done with one Brazil nut a day for 8 weeks, followed by 8 weeks of washout. Blood samples were collected at 5 time points: baseline, 4 and 8 weeks of supplementation and 4 and 8 weeks of washout for analysis of five biomarkers of Se status – erythrocyte GPx1 (Glutathione Peroxidase 1) activity, plasma GPx3 activity, plasma Se, erythrocyte Se, and plasma selenoprotein P. The gene expression of GPX1, SELENOP, SELENOF and SELENOS was done before and after 8 weeks of supplementation. The volunteers were genotyped for SNPs in GPX1 (rs1050450, rs3811699 and rs1800699), GPX4 (rs713041), SELENOP (rs3877899 and rs7579), SELENOF (rs5845) and SELENOS (rs34713741).A total of 130 volunteers finished the protocol. The concentrations of four biomarkers of Se status increased significantly after 4 and 8 weeks of supplementation, being modulated by gender. In addition, erythrocyte GPx1 activity was associated with rs1050450, rs713041 and rs5845. Plasma Se was associated with rs7579 and selenoprotein P with plasma Se at baseline. Nut supplementation significantly increased GPX1 mRNA expression only in subjects with CC genotype at rs1050450. SELENOP mRNA expression was significantly lower in subjects with GG genotype at rs7579 before and after supplementation.Genetic variations in GPX1 and SELENOP genes are associated with different responses of molecular and biochemical biomarkers of Se status after Brazil nut supplementation in healthy Brazilians. The SU.BRA.NUT study was registred at www.clinicaltrials.gov as NCT 03111355.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBrazil nuts 3abiomarkers 3ablood sampling 3aerythrocytes 3agender 3agene expression 3agenes 3agenetic variation 3agenotype 3agenotyping 3aglutathione peroxidase 3ahuman health 3amessenger RNA 3aselenium 3aselenomethionine 3aselenoproteins 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 3asodium selenite 3aBrazil 0aGlutathione peroxidase 0aSNPs 0aSelenium 0aPolymorphisms 0aNutrigenetics 0aSe 0aSec 0aSNP 0aGPx 0aGPX1 0aGPX3 0aGPX4 0aSELENOP 0aSELENOS 0aSELENOF 0aSePP 0aSU.BRA.NUT1 aRogero, Marcelo M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0517-16451 aGuerra-Shinohara, Elvira M.1 aBarbosa, Fernando1 aDesmarchelier, Charles1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9970-70891 aBorel, Patrick1 aSneddon, Alan A.1 aHesketh, John E.1 aCozzolino, Silvia M.F.0 tClinical nutrition.g2019 Apr., v. 38, no. 2 p.539-548dElsevier LtdwJournal:J000000059x0261-56147nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.clnu.2018.03.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03169naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002500149245013400174300001200308520181300320592002802133650001102161650001002172650001502182650003002197650001402227650001802241650001402259650001302273650002202286650001102308650001302319651001102332653002402343653003002367653001702397653002202414653002602436653001702462700002302479773012802502856008402630852000902714655001202723IND60539617820221119225648.0190318e201402  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053961782DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jembe.2013.10.0282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStraughan, Nicole A.10aOntogenetic changes in shell preferences and resource partitioning by the hermit crabs Pagurus hirsutiusculus and P. granosimanus  ap. 1-8.  aOntogenetic shifts in resource use can serve to reduce mortality and intraspecific competition, but can also increase a population's likelihood of extinction. We examined the ontogeny of shell type (i.e. snail species) preferences as well as shell type usage in the field in 2 sympatric species of intertidal hermit crabs, Pagurus hirsutiusculus and P. granosimanus, on Vancouver Island, Canada. An experiment examining shell type preferences by 4 hermit crab size classes, spanning a broad range of juvenile and adult sizes, found that both species have well-defined shell type preferences throughout benthic life; shell type occupancy at 7 field sites was largely consistent with shell type preferences. In addition, shell type preferences in both species changed during ontogeny, in terms of the preferred shell types but also in the diversity of shell types that were used, which decreased with increasing crab size. Thus, as a cohort of hermit crabs grows from newly settled juveniles to full-sized adults, the availability of suitable shells will depend on different snail species; shell availability at different stages of ontogeny would thus be controlled by independent mechanisms. In addition, similar-sized hermit crabs of the 2 species mostly ignored the shell types used by the other species, a resource partitioning that would facilitate coexistence. If shell availability limits the local abundance of these hermit crab species, as previously suggested, our findings indicate they would be limited by different resources (i.e. shells produced by different snail species). The lack of correlation between the abundance estimates of the 2 species at our 7 field sites supports the hypothesis that the local abundance of P. hirsutiusculus and P. granosimanus is controlled by independent factors.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadults 3acrabs 3aextinction 3aintraspecific competition 3ajuveniles 3alittoral zone 3amortality 3aontogeny 3apopulation growth 3asnails 3asympatry 3aCanada 0aEarly benthic phase 0aInterspecific competition 0aMicrohabitat 0aOntogenetic shift 0aPopulation regulation 0aResource use1 aGosselin, Louis A.0 tJournal of experimental marine biology and ecology.g2014 Feb., v. 451 p.1-8dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11705x0022-09817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jembe.2013.10.0283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02873naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100006100139245007100200300001400271500002000285520156900305592002801874596007501902650001601977650001101993650001302004650001502017650001102032650001602043650001002059650001402069650002202083650002302105650001302128650001602141650001102157651001002168700006002178773013102238856007302369852000902442655001202451IND60685780020221122004451.0200307e202003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068578002DNAL7 a10.1111/ens.123922doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYamamoto, Satoshi1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0123-911210aPopulation abundance gradient of Inurois punctigera along altitude  ap. 23-27.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aA winter geometrid moth, Inurois punctigera, shows sympatric and genetically isolated seasonal populations (i.e. early‐ and late‐winter populations) in the cold regions of Japan, whereas it shows only mid‐winter populations in the warm regions. Variation in adult flight phenology on a large geographic scale along latitudinal environmental gradients has been described, but the phenological variation on a more local scale along altitudinal environmental gradients has not yet been characterized. In the present study, we assessed the flight phenology at high‐ and low‐elevation areas in Mt. Rokko, Hyogo, Japan. First, we revealed that flight period was not disrupted in mid‐winter, even at high‐elevation areas (>660 m) but the population abundance was much lower in high‐elevation areas than in low‐elevation areas. Then, in the following two seasons, we investigated I. punctigera abundance, winter harshness (i.e. winter temperature) and their host plant abundance in nine closely located stations in Mt. Rokko. A generalized linear mixed model analysis indicated a greater effect of winter temperature on I. punctigera abundance compared to available food resources, suggesting that differences in winter harshness among elevation shapes the gradient of I. punctigera abundance along altitude. Our findings suggest that harsh conditions during winter function as selective agents on mid‐winter types of I. punctigera, and this could be involved in the divergence between sympatric early‐ and late‐winter populations of I. punctigera.  aPublisher supplied data  aKAKENHI Grant no. 18975041cJapan Society for the Promotion of Science 3aGeometridae 3aadults 3aaltitude 3acold zones 3aflight 3ahost plants 3amoths 3aphenology 3aspecies abundance 3astatistical models 3asympatry 3atemperature 3awinter 3aJapan1 aMatsuhisa, Seiko1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3595-61710 tEntomological science.g2020 Mar., v. 23, no. 1 p.23-27dJohn Wiley & Sons Australia, LtdwJournal:jnl3774063x1343-87867nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ens.123923Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03513naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245014800169300001600317520169900333592002802032650002302060650001202083650002202095650001602117650001502133650001602148650002302164650001202187650001702199650001602216650001102232650001102243650001402254650000702268650000902275650001402284650002402298650002602322650001102348650001302359650002102372651001402393651001202407653002402419653002602443653001602469653002302485653001202508653001102520700001702531700001802548700002202566700001802588700001802606700001802624700001602642773011202658856008402770852000902854655001202863IND60125812120221123013105.0150428e20150330xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012581212DNAL7 a10.1080/09064710.2014.9977872doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aÖsterholm, P.10aGroundwater management of acid sulfate soils using controlled drainage, by-pass flow prevention, and subsurface irrigation on a boreal farmland  ap. 110-120.  aSulfide-bearing anoxic sediments are found in coastal regions around the world including Australia and the Baltic. Upon lowering of the groundwater by drainage, they are oxidized and form acid sulfate soils (pH < 4) that mobilize plenty of potentially toxic metals into watercourses with serious environmental consequences. Being highly valued for their excellent crop yields, there is an urgent need to find management solutions that minimize the oxidation. In this study, possibilities to manage the groundwater with controlled subsurface drainage (CD) and subsurface irrigation (CDI), which included a vertical plastic sheet to prevent by-pass flow into the main drain, was examined on a Boreal farmland in Western Finland. During a 3-year study, the groundwater in the reference field (Ref) with conventional subsurface drainage pipes at 1.1–1.4 m depth typically dropped down to almost 2 m in the end of summers (September) due to evapotranspiration exceeding precipitation. CD delayed the groundwater drop, shortening the time of oxidation. In CDI system, the groundwater could be kept at c. 1 m or shallower throughout the summers, thereby preventing oxidation of critical sulfide horizons in the lower subsoil. Differences in total discharge and soil geochemistry features were small during the course of the study period. Salt accumulation seemed to be a small risk for crop growth but the capillary rise of acidity to the surface horizon may be increased in CDI, possibly increasing the need for surface liming. A “floating groundwater antenna,” indicating groundwater fluctuations, proved to be an easy and reliable tool to farmers for proper management of controlled drainage.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacid sulfate soils 3aacidity 3aagricultural land 3acapillarity 3acrop yield 3adrain pipes 3aevapotranspiration 3afarmers 3ageochemistry 3agroundwater 3aliming 3ametals 3aoxidation 3apH 3arisk 3asediments 3asubsurface drainage 3asubsurface irrigation 3asummer 3atoxicity 3awater management 3aAustralia 3aFinland 0acontrolled drainage 0asubsurface irrigation 0agroundwater 0aacid sulfate soils 0aacidity 0ametals1 aVirtanen, S.1 aRosendahl, R.1 aUusi-Kämppä, J.1 aYlivainio, K.1 aYli-Halla, M.1 aMäensivu, M.1 aTurtola, E.0 tActa agriculturæ Scandinavica.g2015 Mar. 30, v. 65, no. sup1 p.110-120dTaylor & Francisx1651-19137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09064710.2014.9977873Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02644naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002500147245014500172300001600317520125300333592002801586650002301614650001701637650000901654650001801663650002601681650002001707650001501727650002001742650000901762650001601771650001901787653001001806653001401816653002301830653000901853653001601862700002201878700002501900700002201925700002401947773012501971856008102096852000902177655001202186IND60569016220221119170408.0190318e20170915xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056901622DNAL7 a10.1016/j.lwt.2017.05.0302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBernáldez, Victoria14aThe influence of ecophysiological factors on growth, aflR gene expression and aflatoxin B1 production by a type strain of Aspergillus flavus  ap. 283-291.  aMaize is prone to infection by Aspergillus flavus, which can contaminate the product with aflatoxins. The objective of this study was to examine the impact that interactions between water activity (aw) and temperature may have on growth, the expression of a biosynthetic regulatory gene (aflR) and aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) production by a strain of A. flavus on a maize-based medium. Results showed that there were some differences between lag phases and growth rates of A. flavus. The optimum growth rate for A. flavus was at 30 °C and 0.99 aw. No growth occurred at 0.90 aw and 20 °C. Both temperature and aw had an influence on the relative aflR gene expression and AFB1 production by A. flavus; however, the results for AFB1 production were not consistent with the effects on gene expression or growth. These findings provide data that are useful to better understand the conditions which represent higher risks from AFB1 production. However, the aflR expression was not a good indicator of AFB1 production alone. Thus, further molecular studies of other AF-related genes should be done. These results are discussed in the context of harvesting and storage of maize and the prevailing environmental conditions to minimise AFB1 contamination.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAspergillus flavus 3aaflatoxin B1 3acorn 3aecophysiology 3aenvironmental factors 3agene expression 3aharvesting 3aregulator genes 3arisk 3atemperature 3awater activity 0aMaize 0aAflatoxin 0aAspergillus flavus 0aaflR 0aEnvironment1 aCórdoba, Juan J.1 aMagan, N.q(Naresh),1 aPeromingo, Belén1 aRodríguez, Alicia,0 tLebensmittel-Wissenschaft + Technologie.g2017 Sept. 15, v. 83 p.283-291dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl1644x0023-64387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lwt.2017.05.0303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02771naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245010100169300002000270520154600290592002801836650002001864650001101884650001501895650001401910650001301924700001301937700001601950700001801966700002001984700001502004700005202019700005802071700005202129773012202181856008502303852000902388655001202397IND60759835120221122033927.0211214e20211124xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075983512DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.macromol.1c019582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFeng, Fengfeng10aCrystallization of Precise Side-Chain Giant Molecules with Tunable Sequences and Functionalities  ap. 11093-11100.  aSide-chain giant molecules, constructed from giant monomers by precision synthesis, are viewed as a size-amplified analogue of conventional linear polymers. The molecular accuracy in terms of composition, sequence, topology, and functionality makes these precise macromolecules an ideal platform to investigate the interplay of various molecular parameters in their hierarchical assembly processes. In this study, we studied the crystallization of two sets of amphiphilic side-chain giant molecules with elegantly designed chain sequences and functionalities. When crystallizing from dilute solutions, they form well-defined two-dimensional (2D) crystals with a unique sequence-independent feature. In-depth structural characterization suggested a sandwich-like configuration with head-to-head packing of the side-chain components. Interestingly, the chain stem orientation is supposed to be perpendicular to the normal direction of the nanosheet crystals, which was distinct from the classic folded-chain model of conventional linear polymers. Besides, by intentionally altering the functional groups of the non-crystalline moieties to be non-ionic, cationic, or anionic, we proposed that the solvation effect played a key role in inhibiting the crystal stacking along the surface normal direction and thus in stabilizing the 2D crystals. Our findings revealed the unique crystallization behavior of precise side-chain giant molecules and might provide a strategy to engineer 2D nanomaterials with pre-programmed compositions and functions.  aPublisher supplied data 3acrystallization 3amodels 3ananosheets 3asolvation 3atopology1 aShao, Yu1 aWu, Wenjing1 aLi, Xiangqian1 aHong, Chengyang1 aJin, Liang1 aYue, Kan1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1450-02791 aZhang, Wen-Bin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8746-07921 aLiu, Hao1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8390-26960 tMacromolecules.g2021 Nov. 24, v. 54, no. 23 p.11093-11100dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23616x1520-58357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.macromol.1c019583Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03021naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245013500168300001800303500001900321520145300340592002801793596021601821650001202037650001402049650003602063650001702099650001802116650002402134650001202158650001102170650002202181650001602203650002002219650002802239650001002267700002402277700001602301700005502317773012402372856008202496852000902578655001202587IND60689174320221119025754.0200419e202004  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068917432DNAL7 a10.1007/s11033-020-05393-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMahendra, V.

Insulin a key hormone, under certain conditions aggregates and forms pathological amyloid fibrils. Several polyphenols have been studied extensively to elucidate their inhibitory effect on amyloid formation. In the present study, we used insulin as an amyloid model to test the mechanism and efficacy of rutin as an anti-amyloidogenic molecule. By using electron microscopy, dynamic light scattering and circular dichroism spectroscopy, we show that rutin inhibits the insulin aggregate and fibril formation. Further, rutin interacts with insulin directly and inhibits fibril formation in a dose-dependent manner as demonstrated by micro scale thermophoresis experiments. The molecular docking study predicted the potential binding pocket of rutin at the interface of chain A and chain B of insulin thereby preventing it from forming the aggregates. Since, rutin is a natural anti-oxidant, we studied its role in diminishing amyloid fibril induced cytotoxicity and apoptosis. Rutin, decreases the insulin amyloid fibrils-induced Neuro-2a cytotoxicity by reducing reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels which in turn downregulates Bax and upregulates Bcl-2 and pBad proteins. These findings suggest the potential action of rutin in preventing protein misfolding, cell death, and serves as a lead structure to design novel anti-amyloidosis compounds.  aPublisher supplied data  aCouncil of Scientific and Industrial Research, India (Council of Scientific and Industrial Research, India (12th Five Year Plan Project NUTRI-ARM (BSC0404)cCouncil of Scientific and Industrial Research, India 3aamyloid 3aapoptosis 3acircular dichroism spectroscopy 3acytotoxicity 3adose response 3aelectron microscopy 3ainsulin 3amodels 3amolecular biology 3apolyphenols 3aprotein folding 3areactive oxygen species 3arutin1 aYogendra Prasad, K.1 aGanesan, P.1 aKumar, Ravi1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8441-032X0 tMolecular biology reports.g2020 Apr., v. 47, no. 4 p.2811-2820dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl5510x0301-48517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11033-020-05393-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01714naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245010900159300001800268500001400286520039000300592002800690650002100718650002800739650001900767650002000786650001900806650001600825650002100841650002600862650002600888653000900914653002000923653001900943653002900962700002100991700002401012773018501036856007401221852000901295655001201304IND60692182720221120155212.0200502e20120623xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069218272DNAL7 a10.1271/bbb.1200412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYAMANAKA, Yuki10aInduction of YdeO, a Regulator for Acid Resistance Genes, by Ultraviolet Irradiation in Escherichia coli  ap. 1236-1238.  aNAL-light  aYdeO, an AraC-type transcription factor, is an important regulator in the induction of acid-resistance genes in Escherichia coli.

Although inadequate protection of habitat on federal lands was the primary reason for listing, the status of lynx in the lower 48 states is not well understood. Thus, we initiated a telemetry study to assess the status of a lynx population in northern Maine, USA. In this manuscript, we present findings on a source of mortality not previously documented. Between 1999 and 2011, we captured 187 lynx, equipped 85 with radio‐collars, and investigated mortalities when they occurred. Predation was the leading source of mortality and accounted for ≥18 of 65 mortalities, 14 of which were attributed to fishers (Martes pennanti). Although fisher predation did not appear to restrict population growth during this study, we recommend that lynx and fishers be monitored where the species coexist to better inform management decisions. © 2018 The Wildlife Society.  aPublisher supplied data  cMaine Section 6 Endangered Species Grants  cFederal Aid in Wildlife Restoration  cDavis Conservation Foundation  cSweet Water Trust  cDefenders of Wildlife  cMaine State Wildlife Grants  cLynx System Developers  cPlum Creek Foundation  cUnited States Fish and Wildlife Service Northeast Region Science Support funds  cWildlife Conservation Society  cMaine Wildlife Conservation and Restoration Program  cMaine Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife  cNational Fish and Wildlife Foundation  cMaine Outdoor Heritage Fund  cNational Council of Air and Stream Improvement, Inc.  cInternational Paper 3aLynx canadensis 3aMartes pennanti 3ageographical distribution 3ahabitats 3amortality 3apopulation growth 3apredation 3aradio frequency identification 3atelemetry 3athreatened species 3aCanada 3aMaine1 aVashon, Jennifer H.1 aJohnson, Erica L.1 aCrowley, Shannon M.1 aVashon, Adam D.0 tjournal of wildlife management.g2018 Nov., v. 82, no. 8 p.1775-1783dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl46144x0022-541X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jwmg.215383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02649naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002000140245010500160300001800265500001900283520121900302592002801521650002101549650001201570650002601582650001801608650001801626650002901644650003001673650001301703650001901716650002201735650001201757653002201769653001701791653002401808700001901832700001701851700001701868700001901885700001901904773018501923856007402108852000902182655001202191IND60692182820221120155250.0200502e20120623xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069218282DNAL7 a10.1271/bbb.1200452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLIM, Byung-Kwan10aRole of the Myristoylation Site in Expressing Exogenous Functional Proteins in Coxsackieviral Vector  ap. 1173-1176.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aWe generated a cardiotropic replication-competent chimeric coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3) to express alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH). Although exogenously expressed ADH was found by Western blot analysis, its enzyme function was repressed. To define the factor that inhibits the enzymatic function of ADH, we introduced a site-directed mutation at the second amino acid (MGAQEF···) of the CVB3 VP0 capsid protein, effectively changing glycine to alanine. This glycine is known to be a myristoylation site during viral capsid protein maturation in infected cells. In contrast to the unmodified virus, ADH expression and enzymatic function were readily detectable in the mutated rCVB3-ADH (G2A) virus. While expression of ADH required mutation of the CVB3 VP0 myristoylation site for proper function, another chimeric virus that expresses green fluorescent protein (rCVB3-GFP (G or A)) worked independently of the myristoylation site. Indeed, infected HeLa cells displayed GFP under a fluorescent microscope. These results indicate that the myristoylation site in the VP0 capsid protein inhibited the expression of enzymatically active ADH but not GFP. VP0 myristoylation is dispensable for chimeric CVB3 virus replication.  aPublisher supplied data 3aWestern blotting 3aalanine 3aalcohol dehydrogenase 3abiotechnology 3acoat proteins 3afluorescence microscopes 3agreen fluorescent protein 3amutation 3amyristoylation 3avirus replication 3aviruses 0acoxsackievirus B3 0aviral vector 0amyristoylation site1 aYUN, Soo-hyeon1 aJU, Eun-Seon1 aGIL, Chae-Ok1 aKIM, Duk-Kyung1 aJEON, Eun-Seok0 tBioscience, biotechnology, and biochemistry.g2012 June 23, v. 76, no. 6 p.1173-1176dJapan Society for Bioscience, Biotechnology, and AgrochemistrywJournal:18959x1347-69477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1271/bbb.1200453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02937naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245009600168300001400264520165800278592002801936650001501964650001101979650001201990650001102002650001902013650001702032650001302049650000902062650001802071650001102089650002502100650001402125650001402139650001802153650001102171650001602182650001102198651001002209700002902219700002402248700001802272773008302290856008502373852000902458655001202467IND60084467920221116224645.0141101e201205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008446792DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecolind.2011.04.0292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHerva, Marta10aNew insights on ecological footprinting as environmental indicator for production processes  ap. 84-90.  aThe ecological footprint (EF) has reached worldwide popularity in the last decade as an interesting environmental indicator, and its applications have been extended to different fields. However, shortcomings of the methodology behind the EF calculations have been reported and the need for further improvements has been remarked, especially when this indicator is applied to measure the sustainability of production processes. This paper deals with three controversial aspects of the EF. First, the influence on estimates of using regional or global factors was explored; thus, a specific CO₂ absorption rate was assessed for Galicia (NW Spain) using two different methodologies. These were applied to assess the EF of a ceramic industry (manufacture of bricks in baked clay) typical from Galicia, and the results were compared to the case when a global rate was employed. Another aim of the paper was to assess the effect of incorporating acidifying emissions, which are generally excluded from EF appraisals (as well as any other emissions apart from CO₂). With this purpose, the critical load concept was applied to the same case study in order to analyze the impact of acidifying emissions derived from the burning of fuel oil or natural gas for the drying and firing stages of a ceramic production process, as well as their influence in the EF figure. Finally, a methodology that models a closed cycle for wastes – including hazardous ones – through a plasma process was presented and analyzed, assessing the influence of carbon content and observing the likely contribution that considering waste production can have on the EF calculation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3abricks 3aburning 3acarbon 3acarbon dioxide 3acase studies 3aceramics 3aclay 3acritical load 3adrying 3aecological footprint 3aemissions 3afuel oils 3amanufacturing 3amodels 3anatural gas 3awastes 3aSpain1 aGarcía-Diéguez, Carlos1 aFranco-Uría, Amaya1 aRoca, Enrique0 tEcological indicators.g2012 May, v. 16 p.84-90dElsevier Ltdx1470-160X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2011.04.0293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02750naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100006000140245008500200300001800285500002000303520144200323592002801765596004701793650002201840650002201862650001001884650002401894650001501918700001801933700001801951700006401969700001702033700001902050700002002069700005902089773013202148856007502280852000902355655001202364IND60787145820221120202443.0220807e201811  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078714582DNAL7 a10.1002/jwmg.215442doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNelson, David M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2755-553510aCarcass age and searcher identity affect morphological assessment of sex of bats  ap. 1582-1587.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aCarcasses provide an important resource for assessing the vulnerability of bat species and sexes to threats, but the reliability of sex data derived from the external morphology (sexₘₒᵣₚₕ) of bat carcasses remains uncertain. We used genetic‐based assessment of sex (sexgₑₙ) to evaluate the effect of carcass age and searcher identity on sexₘₒᵣₚₕ‐based assessments of eastern red (Lasiurus borealis) and hoary (Lasiurus cinereus) bat carcasses identified by 15 different searchers at a wind‐energy facility. The proportion of carcasses for which sexₘₒᵣₚₕ was unknown increased from 0.11 for those recovered within a day of death, to 0.56 within 2–3 days of death, and to ≥0.82 at ≥4 days after death. The proportion of carcasses for which sexₘₒᵣₚₕ was correct decreased from 0.9 for those recovered within a day of death, to 0.65 within 2–3 days of death, and to 0.25 at ≥4 days after death. The proportion of sexₘₒᵣₚₕ misidentifications of the 108 fresh carcasses (collected within 24 hours of death) varied (0.0–0.43) among searchers. These results suggest that sexₘₒᵣₚₕ‐based assessments should be limited to fresh carcasses. Furthermore, additional training of people who collect and identify bat carcasses from renewable‐energy facilities may improve the accuracy of sexₘₒᵣₚₕ data obtained from carcasses. © 2018 The Wildlife Society.  aPublisher supplied data  aF15AC00759cU.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 3aLasiurus borealis 3aLasiurus cinereus 3adeath 3awildlife management 3awind power1 aNagel, Juliet1 aTrott, Regina1 aCampbell, Caitlin J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8199-77751 aPruitt, Lori1 aGood, Rhett E.1 aIskali, Goniela1 aGugger, Paul F.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4464-84530 tjournal of wildlife management.g2018 Nov., v. 82, no. 8 p.1582-1587dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl46144x0022-541X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jwmg.215443Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02146naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100005300142245010000195300002000295520092400315592002801239650002201267650002501289650001501314650001001329650001101339650001901350650001801369650001401387700001901401700005301420700005801473700001801531773015001549856007601699852000901775655001201784IND60672115120221118052632.0191009e20190916xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067211512DNAL7 a10.1021/jacs.9b084052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Hui1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1094-882610aProbing Single Molecule Binding and Free Energy Profile with Plasmonic Imaging of Nanoparticles  ap. 16071-16078.  aMeasuring binding between molecules is critical for understanding basic biochemical processes, developing molecular diagnosis, and screening drugs. Here we study molecular binding at the single molecule level by attaching nanoparticles to the molecular binding pairs. We track the thermal fluctuations of the individual nanoparticles with sub-nanometer precision using a plasmonic scattering imaging technique and show that the fluctuations are controlled by the molecular binding pairs rather than by the nanoparticles. Analysis of the thermal fluctuations provides unique information on molecular binding, including binding energy profile, effective spring constant, and switching between single and multiple molecular binding events. The method provides new insights into molecular binding and also allows one to differentiate nonspecific binding from specific binding, which has been a difficult task in biosensors.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGibbs free energy 3abiochemical pathways 3abiosensors 3adrugs 3aenergy 3aimage analysis 3ananoparticles 3ascreening1 aTang, Zhuodong1 aWang, Yan1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9668-41091 aMa, Guangzhong1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1197-659X1 aTao, Nongjian0 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2019 Sept. 16, v. 141, no. 40 p.16071-16078dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19166x1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jacs.9b084053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02908naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245008800168300001800256520180700274592002802081650000802109650001102117650001902128650001802147650003502165650001502200650001402215650000902229650003002238650001902268650001502287700001802302700001702320773010702337856008102444852000902525655001202534IND60438742420221122193635.0151023e201510  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6043874242DNAL7 a10.1007/s00299-015-1826-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMikami, Masafumi10aParameters affecting frequency of CRISPR/Cas9 mediated targeted mutagenesis in rice  ap. 1807-1815.  aKEY MESSAGE : Frequency of CRISPR/Cas9-mediated targeted mutagenesis varies depending on Cas9 expression level and culture period of rice callus. Recent reports have demonstrated that the CRISPR/Cas9 system can function as a sequence-specific nuclease in various plant species. Induction of mutation in proliferating tissue during embryogenesis or in germline cells is a practical means of generating heritable mutations. In the case of plant species in which cultured cells are used for transformation, non-chimeric plants can be obtained when regeneration occurs from mutated cells. Since plantlets are regenerated from both mutated and non-mutated cells in a random manner, any increment in the proportion of mutated cells in Cas9- and guide RNA (gRNA)-expressing cells will help increase the number of plants containing heritable mutations. In this study, we examined factors affecting mutation frequency in rice calli. Following sequential transformation of rice calli with Cas9- and gRNA- expression constructs, the mutation frequency in independent Cas9 transgenic lines was analyzed. A positive correlation between Cas9 expression level and mutation frequency was found. This positive relationship was observed regardless of whether the transgene or an endogenous gene was used as the target for CRISPR/Cas9-mediated mutagenesis. Furthermore, we found that extending the culture period increased the proportion of mutated cells as well as the variety of mutations obtained. Because mutated and non-mutated cells might proliferate equally, these results suggest that a prolonged tissue culture period increases the chance of inducing de novo mutations in non-mutated cells. This fundamental knowledge will help improve systems for obtaining non-chimeric regenerated plants in many plant species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRNA 3acallus 3acultured cells 3aembryogenesis 3agenetically modified organisms 3agerm cells 3aplantlets 3arice 3asite-directed mutagenesis 3atissue culture 3atransgenes1 aToki, Seiichi1 aEndo, Masaki0 tPlant cell reports.g2015 Oct., v. 34, no. 10 p.1807-1815dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx0721-77147nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00299-015-1826-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03371naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245010000167300001600267520167100283536032101954592002802275650001702303650001402320650001402334650001402348650002302362650001602385650001802401650001302419650002502432650001702457653002502474653002502499653001402524653001602538700002302554700001702577700002002594700001902614700001902633700001402652700001402666773011402680856008602794852000902880655001202889IND60733471320221117234546.0220827e20200101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073347132DNAL7 a10.1080/13880209.2020.17117832doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHe, Shou-Di10aOridonin suppresses autophagy and survival in rheumatoid arthritis fibroblast-like synoviocytes  ap. 146-151.  aOridonin exhibits various pharmacological and physiological activities, including antioxidant, antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, pro-apoptotic, anticancer and neurological effects. However, its role in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is yet to be revealed. We evaluated the effects of oridonin on the survival and autophagy of RA-fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLSs). RA-FLSs were treated with oridonin at serial concentrations of 0, 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10 µg/mL for 24, 48 and 72 h. Then, cell proliferation and apoptosis were measured. A GFP-LC3 plasmid was transfected into the cells to determine autophagy. Oridonin suppressed RA-FLS proliferation in a dose-dependent manner. The half maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC₅₀) of oridonin at 24, 48 and 72 h were 8.28, 7.88 and 8.35 µg/mL, respectively. Treatment with oridonin for 24 h increased apoptosis by 4.1%, and increased the protein levels of Bax and cleaved caspase-3 but significantly decreased the levels of IL-1β in the culture supernatant (p < 0.05). In addition, 6 h of oridonin treatment significantly decreased the number of GFP-LC3 punctate dots and inhibited the protein levels of ATG5 and Beclin1 by 80.01% and 42.12%, respectively. Chloroquine (CQ) significantly reinforced the effects of oridonin on inhibition of autophagy, suppression of proliferation, and induction of apoptosis in RA-FLSs (p < 0.05). Our results indicate that treatment with oridonin in combination with CQ inhibits autophagy and cell proliferation and induces apoptosis in RA-FLSs more effectively than treatment oridonin alone. This finding indicates that oridonin is a potential therapeutic agent for RA.  aThis work was supported by the Guangdong Science and Technology Research Project (2017A020215129); Shenzhen Scientific Technology Basic Research Project (JCYJ20160429183052202); Shenzhen Health and Family Planning Research Project (201606050); and the Shenzhen Nanshan District Scientific Research Project (2015021).  aPublisher supplied data 3aantioxidants 3aapoptosis 3aautophagy 3acaspase-3 3acell proliferation 3achloroquine 3adose response 3aplasmids 3arheumatoid arthritis 3atherapeutics 0aChloroquine Oridonin 0arheumatoid arthritis 0aautophagy 0achloroquine1 aHuang, Sheng-Guang1 aZhu, Hui-Jun1 aLuo, Xiao-Guang1 aLiao, Kang-Han1 aZhang, Jie-Yao1 aTan, Ning1 aLi, De-Yu0 tPharmaceutical biology.g2020 Jan. 1, v. 58, no. 1 p.146-151dTaylor & FranciswJournal:2153x1744-51167nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13880209.2020.17117833Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01578naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002600151245011500177300001400292520046300306592002800769650001000797650001400807650001900821651001000840653000800850653000700858653000800865653000700873653002600880653002000906653001200926653001900938653001900957700002600976773009601002856008501098852000901183655001201192IND60609975720221122170435.0180824e201702  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060997572DNAL7 a10.1016/j.econlet.2016.11.0372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOto-Peralias, Daniel,14aThe consequences of persistent inequality on social capital: A municipal-level analysis of blood donation data  ap. 53-57.  aThis paper advances the hypothesis that persistent inequality affects cultural traits and undermines social capital.

In this work, we report the charge transport properties of conjugated oligomers with oxazole anchors, focusing on the role of the heteroatom substitution position in terminal oxazole groups. Our results show that oxazole serves as an efficient anchor group to form stable gold–molecule–gold junctions. We further observe quantum interference (QI) effects in oxazole-terminated phenylene molecular junctions, including destructive QI in meta-substituted phenyl rings and constructive QI in para-substituted phenyl rings containing terminal oxazole groups with the same chemical constitution on both termini (i.e., O₅O₅ (5-oxazolyl) or O₄O₄ (4-oxazolyl) linkages on both termini). Surprisingly, meta-substituted phenyl rings with nonequivalent constitutions (i.e., O₄O₅ oxazole terminal linkages) show unexpectedly higher conductance as compared to para-substituted analogues. These results suggest that charge transport in oxazole-terminated molecules is determined by the heteroatom substitution position of the oxazole anchor in addition to the aryl substitution pattern of the π-conjugated core. Our results further show that conjugated molecules with homogeneous oxazole linkages obey a quantum circuit rule such that GO₄₋ₚ₋O₄/GO₄₋ₘ₋O₄ = GO₅₋ₚ₋O₅/GO₅₋ₘ₋O₅, where G is molecular conductance. Overall, our work provides key insight into the development of new chemistries for molecular circuitry in the rapidly advancing field of single molecule electronics.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaromatic compounds 3aelectrodes 3aelectronics 3ananowires 3aoxazoles1 aYu, Hao1 aSchwieter, Kenneth1 aChen, Kejia1 aLi, Bo1 aLiu, Yun1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7077-363X1 aMoore, Jeffrey,1 aSchroeder, Charles M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6023-22740 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2019 Sept. 13, v. 141, no. 40 p.16079-16084dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19166x1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jacs.9b084273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02528naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001800146245007200164300002000236520128100256592002801537650001501565650001401580650001401594650001301608650001601621650001701637650002001654650001901674650001501693650000701708650001501715650003401730650002101764700002001785700002401805700006301829773013701892856008002029852000902109655001202118IND60606170320180918000000.0180724e20180508xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060617032DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.8b032712doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRouster, Paul10aFunctionalized Titania Nanosheet Dispersions of Peroxidase Activity  ap. 11455-11463.  aNanocomposites of titania nanosheets (TNS), horseradish peroxidase (HRP), and poly(diallyldimethylammonium chloride) (PDADMAC) were prepared, and their colloidal and functional stabilities were assessed. HRP quantitatively adsorbed on bare TNS, and the adsorption process did not affect the charging and aggregation behavior of the colloidal system. The obtained TNS–HRP composite was functionalized by PDADMAC to stabilize the enzyme on the surface and to maintain good colloidal stability. Depending on the PDADMAC dose applied, its adsorption on TNS–HRP led to charge reversal of the particles from negative to positive. The formation of a saturated polyelectrolyte layer on the TNS–HRP (TNS–HRP–PDADMAC) gave rise to highly stable colloids, and especially the resistance against salt-induced aggregation was excellent. The enzymatic activity of different systems was investigated as a function of the pH of the medium and over time. The results indicated that HRP remained enzymatically active upon immobilization, and in addition, the pH range of application broadened compared to its native form. The developed TNS–HRP–PDADMAC system can thus be used in a wider pH range and possesses the advantages of a heterogeneous catalyst compared to the bare enzyme.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3acatalysts 3achlorides 3acolloids 3adispersions 3aelectrolytes 3aenzyme activity 3ananocomposites 3ananosheets 3apH 3aperoxidase 3aquaternary ammonium compounds 3atitanium dioxide1 aPavlovic, Marko1 aSáringer, Szilárd1 aSzilágyi, István,1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7289-09790 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2018 May 08, v. 122, no. 21 p.11455-11463dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23573x1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.8b032713Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03425naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002300150245012100173300001600294520193700310592002802247650002802275650002202303650002102325650000902346650002002355650002902375650001502404650001602419650001702435650001602452650001502468650002102483650001302504650002002517650001202537650001302549651001102562653002402573653002902597653002902626653002502655653002102680653002502701773011202726856008402838852000902922655001202931IND60125812820221123012937.0150428e20150430xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012581282DNAL7 a10.1080/09064710.2014.9773392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStenrød, Marianne10aLong-term trends of pesticides in Norwegian agricultural streams and potential future challenges in northern climate  ap. 199-216.  aEffective plant protection practices and use of chemical pesticides are a prerequisite for maintaining yields of sufficient quality and quantity in conventional agriculture today. Despite regulatory efforts to ensure safe use, reports have indicated that residual amounts of pesticides and their metabolites occur in surface and ground water and may have non-target effects on aquatic organisms. The objective of the present study was to identify environmental challenges of pesticide use in the northern climate by evaluating long-term pesticide monitoring data compiled by the Norwegian Agricultural Environmental Monitoring Programme. Pesticide use data and pesticide concentrations measured in stream water from six small agricultural catchments in Norway were analysed. Observed trends in pesticide detection frequencies, measured concentrations and cumulative risk from the six monitoring sites were compared. The results demonstrated the need for continued focus on the herbicides metribuzin and aclonifen, and potential concerns regarding use of the fungicide prothioconazole and the insecticide imidacloprid. The six monitoring sites represented the diversity of intensively cropped areas in Norway and differed with respect to estimated cumulative risk. Vegetable and potato cropping areas showed not only the highest level of total environmental risk, but also a statistically significant decreasing trend over the monitoring period. Cereal cropping areas exhibited no statistically significant time-dependent trends in the studied parameters but did show an increase in fungicide use that requires continued attention. The need for risk assessment of mixture toxicity effects and improved monitoring strategy is also discussed. In conclusion, the present results imply that the current global focus on multiple stressors and mixture toxicity of pesticides in stream water is equally relevant in cold climatic conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural watersheds 3aaquatic organisms 3aclimatic factors 3acold 3acumulative risk 3aenvironmental monitoring 3afungicides 3agroundwater 3aimidacloprid 3ametabolites 3ametribuzin 3aplant protection 3apotatoes 3arisk assessment 3astreams 3atoxicity 3aNorway 0aagricultural stream 0acold climatic conditions 0aenvironmental risk index 0atime-dependent trend 0amixture toxicity 0apesticide monitoring0 tActa agriculturæ Scandinavica.g2015 Apr. 30, v. 65, no. sup2 p.199-216dTaylor & Francisx1651-19137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09064710.2014.9773393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02966naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245010900170300001600279520180400295592002802099650002302127650002102150650001402171650002002185650001402205650001902219650001902238650001802257650002402275653002902299653001602328653002102344700001802365773011402383856008602497852000902583655001202592IND60733471620221117234555.0220827e20200101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073347162DNAL7 a10.1080/13880209.2020.17191652doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJiang, Jinsong10aMatrine protects PC12 cells from lipopolysaccharide-evoked inflammatory injury via upregulation of miR-9  ap. 314-320.  aMatrine is a well-known anti-inflammatory quinolizidine alkaloid derived from leguminous plant Sophora flavescens Ait. (Leguminosae). This study was designed to uncover the potential application of matrine in treating spinal cord injury (SCI). Neuron-like PC12 cells in experimental groups were pre-treated with/without matrine (200 μM) for 24 h and then stimulated by lipopolysaccharide (LPS, 5 μg/mL) for 12 h. PC12 cells in control group were cultured in complete medium. CCK-8 assay, flow cytometry, qRT-PCR, western blot and ELISA were performed to evaluate cell damage. Moreover, after cells were transfected with miR-9 inhibitor for 48 h, above indicators were tested again. qRT-PCR and western blot were also conducted to uncover the downstream effectors and signalling pathways for matrine. LPS (5 μg/mL) decreased cell viability about 50%. Matrine (200 μM) decreased cell viability about 0%, 13.8% and 30% at 24 h, 48 h and 72 h, respectively. The loss of viability, stimulation of apoptosis, and release of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α) evoked by LPS were attenuated by the pre-treatment of matrine partly. Meanwhile, LPS reduced miR-9 expression about 60%, but matrine completely reversed LPS-decreased miR-9 level. By silencing miR-9 expression, the protective properties of matrine towards PC12 cells were impeded. Besides, matrine inhibited the activation of JNK and NF–κB pathways even under the condition of LPS. And the impact of matrine on the signalling were attenuated by miR-9 silencing. This paper provided in vitro evidence that matrine was able to protect PC12 cells against LPS-evoked damage. The neuroprotective properties of matrine may be due to its regulation of miR-9 expression as well as JNK and NF–κB pathways.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSophora flavescens 3aWestern blotting 3aalkaloids 3aanimal injuries 3aapoptosis 3acell viability 3aflow cytometry 3ainterleukin-6 3alipopolysaccharides 0aSpinal cord injury (SCI) 0aJNK pathway 0aNF–κB pathway1 aWang, Guangji0 tPharmaceutical biology.g2020 Jan. 1, v. 58, no. 1 p.314-320dTaylor & FranciswJournal:2153x1744-51167nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13880209.2020.17191653Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02424naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001500150245009100165300002000256520107300276592002801349650002701377650001701404650001001421650002401431650001201455650003701467700001601504700001601520700001801536700001801554700001401572700005401586700005701640700005701697700005601754773012201810856008501932852000902017655001202026IND60759835720221122054619.0211214e20211201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075983572DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.macromol.1c020512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Jing10aZ/E Effect on Phase Behavior of Main-Chain Liquid Crystalline Polymers Bearing AIEgens  ap. 10740-10749.  aThe structure–property relationship of luminescent liquid crystalline polymers (LLCPs) with AIEgens has attracted much attention. However, the effect of the AIEgen configuration on the properties is still unclear because of the difficulty in designing LLCPs with a single configuration. In addition, it is expected that this effect can be amplified through constructing the AIEgen on the backbone of LLCPs. Herein, for the first time, we have synthesized two kinds of main-chain polyesters with a single configuration of an AIEgen, E-PM7 and Z-PM7, via melt polycondensation. Interestingly, E-PM7 shows two coexisting phases of rectangular columnar and smectic liquid crystalline phases, whereas Z-PM7 exhibits no liquid crystalline properties. Moreover, E-PM7 with AIE behavior and liquid crystalline properties can be used to prepare fluorescent patterns printed on flexible films and glass substrates through the photocyclization of AIE units, which endows this kind of material with promising applications ranging from anti-counterfeiting to information storage.  aPublisher supplied data 3acondensation reactions 3afluorescence 3aglass 3ainformation storage 3aliquids 3astructure-activity relationships1 aJiang, Qian1 aCao, Shuang1 aSun, Chenchen1 aZhang, Yuping1 aQiu, Yuan1 aWang, Hong1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5201-78461 aYin, Guochuan1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1003-84781 aLiao, Yonggui1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2943-15011 aXie, Xiaolin1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5097-74160 tMacromolecules.g2021 Dec. 01, v. 54, no. 23 p.10740-10749dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23616x1520-58357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.macromol.1c020513Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02509naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002100139245011800160300001400278500002000292520099700312592002801309596005701337596005901394596005901453596005901512650001801571650001401589650002401603650001101627650001101638650001501649650001601664650001501680650002301695650002301718650001401741651002801755651001101783700005601794773013101850856007301981852000902054655001202063IND60685780820221123024503.0200307e202003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068578082DNAL7 a10.1111/ens.123932doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGYÖRGY, Zoltán10aHost‐plant range expansion to Gymnocladus dioica by an introduced seed predatory beetle Megabruchidius dorsalis  ap. 28-32.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aA seed predatory beetle, Megabruchidius dorsalis (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae: Bruchinae) native to the Oriental region was first found to utilize a North American Gymnocladus dioica (Fabaceae: Caesalpinioideae) in its introduced area in Central Europe. A maximum of three adult exit holes were found on a single seed. Host‐plants of the bruchine beetle have been reviewed from its native and introduced regions, including a host record of Gleditsia fera from Taiwan. Our review indicated the beetle's strict oligophagy on caesalpinioid Gleditsia species. On the contrary, our finding suggests that the beetle's host‐range extends to the caesalpinioid Umtiza clade. On the plant side, this study provides a counterexample to the enemy release hypothesis that predicts fewer predators/parasites in an organism's range of introduction than in their native range; Gy. dioica is attacked by the seed predator in its introduced region, whereas in its native range it is free from seed predators.  aPublisher supplied data  a17H04612cJapan Society for the Promotion of Science  aJP23405008cJapan Society for the Promotion of Science  aJP25430194cJapan Society for the Promotion of Science  aJP26304016cJapan Society for the Promotion of Science 3aChrysomelidae 3aGleditsia 3aGymnocladus dioicus 3aUmtiza 3aadults 3agranivores 3ahost plants 3ahost range 3aindigenous species 3aintroduced species 3aparasites 3aCentral European region 3aTaiwan1 aTUDA, Midori1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8727-71810 tEntomological science.g2020 Mar., v. 23, no. 1 p.28-32dJohn Wiley & Sons Australia, LtdwJournal:jnl3774063x1343-87867nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ens.123933Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03387naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002300150245012400173300001600297520169800313592002802011650002202039650002802061650001202089650001502101650001202116650001802128650002302146650002502169650001802194651001502212651001202227651001202239651001202251651001102263651001402274651001102288651001102299653002802310653001902338653001102357653001502368653001502383653002002398700002102418700002302439700002902462700001602491700001902507700002202526700002002548700002402568773011202592856008402704852000902788655001202797IND60125812920221123012903.0150428e20150430xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012581292DNAL7 a10.1080/09064710.2014.9936902doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPengerud, Annelene10aTemporal trends in phosphorus concentrations and losses from agricultural catchments in the Nordic and Baltic countries  ap. 173-185.  aThis paper in a uniform manner examines temporal trends in phosphorus (P) concentrations and losses from small and well-monitored agricultural catchments in the Nordic and Baltic countries. Thirty-four catchments (range 0.1–33 km ²) in Norway (8), Denmark (5), Sweden (8), Finland (4), Estonia (3), Latvia (3) and Lithuania (3) were selected for the study. The time series ranged from 10 (2002–2011) to 21 years (1989–2009). The monthly P concentration and loss time series were tested for significant monotone trends (p < 0.05; two-sided test) using the partial Mann–Kendall test with stream discharge as an explanatory variable. The results show a large variation in concentrations and losses of total phosphorus (TP) among the 34 studied catchments, where the long-term mean annual losses varied from 0.09 to 7.5 kg TP ha ⁻¹. In addition, a large interannual variability in losses within catchments was found with up to a factor of 23 between years within the same catchment. Six catchments showed downward temporal trends in the TP loss time series. One upward trend in TP losses was detected in a catchment in south-west Sweden. Eight downward trends were detected in the TP concentration time series. Overall, our results show (1) a huge variability in mean P losses and concentrations among catchments, (2) a huge temporal variability in losses within catchments and (3) few detectable changes in P losses and concentrations over the study period. The results showcase the need for implementation of mitigation strategies towards reduced P losses from agricultural landscapes in the Nordic/Baltic Sea region in order to improve P water quality and ecology in surface waters.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural land 3aagricultural watersheds 3aecology 3aphosphorus 3astreams 3asurface water 3atemporal variation 3atime series analysis 3awater quality 3aBaltic Sea 3aDenmark 3aEstonia 3aFinland 3aLatvia 3aLithuania 3aNorway 3aSweden 0aagricultural catchments 0aconcentrations 0alosses 0amonitoring 0aphosphorus 0atemporal trends1 aStålnacke, Per,1 aBechmann, Marianne1 aBlicher-Mathiesen, Gitte1 aIital, Arvo1 aKoskiaho, Jari1 aKyllmar, Katarina1 aLagzdins, Ainis1 aPovilaitis, Arvydas0 tActa agriculturæ Scandinavica.g2015 Apr. 30, v. 65, no. sup2 p.173-185dTaylor & Francisx1651-19137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09064710.2014.9936903Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03623naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002300148245007000171300001600241520220900257592002802466650001302494650002402507650001402531650001002545650001802555650001402573650002602587650001302613650001902626653001802645653001402663653001902677653001302696653000802709653000702717653000702724653000802731653000702739653000702746653000702753653000702760653000702767700002002774700002002794700002102814700001902835700002502854773011002879856008302989852000903072655001203081IND60635119220221116215910.0191004e201904  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063511922DNAL7 a10.1016/j.clnu.2018.04.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHartl, Wolfgang H.10aCalorie intake and short-term survival of critically ill patients  ap. 660-667.  aThe association between calorie supply and outcome of critically ill patients is unclear. Results from observational studies contradict findings of randomized studies, and have been questioned because of unrecognized confounding by indication. The present study wanted to re-examine the associations between the daily amount of calorie intake and short-term survival of critically ill patients using several novel statistical approaches.9661 critically ill patients from 451 ICUs were extracted from an international database. We examined associations between survival time and three pragmatic nutritional categories (I: <30% of target, II: 30–70%, III: >70%) reflecting different amounts of total daily calorie intake. We compared hazard ratios for the 30-day risk of dying estimated for different hypothetical nutrition support plans (different categories of daily calorie intake during the first 11 days after ICU admission). To minimize indication bias, we used a lag time between nutrition and outcome, we particularly considered daily amounts of calorie intake, and we adjusted results to the route of calorie supply (enteral, parenteral, oral).1974 patients (20.4%) died in hospital before day 30. Median of daily artificial calorie intake was 1.0 kcal/kg [IQR 0.0–4.1] in category I, 12.3 kcal/kg [9.4–15.4] in category II, and 23.5 kcal/kg [19.5–27.8] in category III. When compared to a plan providing daily minimal amounts of calories (category I), the adjusted minimal hazard ratios for a delayed (from day 5–11) or an early (from day 1–11) mildly hypocaloric nutrition (category II) were 0.71 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.54 to 0.94) and 0.56 (95% CI, 0.38 to 0.82), respectively. No substantial hazard change could be detected, when a delayed or an early, near target calorie intake (category III) was compared to an early, mildly hypocaloric nutrition.Compared to a severely hypocaloric nutrition, a mildly hypocaloric nutrition is associated with a decreased risk of death. In unselected critically ill patients, this risk cannot be reduced further by providing amounts of calories close to the calculated target.ID number ISRCTN17829198, website http://www.isrctn.org.  aPublisher supplied data 3aInternet 3aconfidence interval 3adatabases 3adeath 3aenergy intake 3ahospitals 3aobservational studies 3apatients 3arisk reduction 0aCritical care 0aNutrition 0aCaloric supply 0aSurvival 0aICU 0aHR 0aCI 0aBMI 0akg 0aOI 0aEN 0aPN 0aMV1 aBender, Andreas1 aScheipl, Fabian1 aKuppinger, David1 aDay, Andrew G.1 aKüchenhoff, Helmut,0 tClinical nutrition.g2019 Apr., v. 38, no. 2 p.660-667dElsevier LtdwJournal:J000000059x0261-56147nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.clnu.2018.04.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03565naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002900149245010300178300001400281520204700295592002802342650002002370650001902390650001102409650001002420650000902430650002202439650001602461650000902477650001502486650001602501650001602517651001002533651001102543653001502554653002402569653001902593653001802612653001302630700001502643700003202658700002802690700001802718700002102736700002002757700003202777773014502809856008402954852000903038655001203047IND60539618620221119223847.0190318e201402  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053961862DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jembe.2013.11.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMarshall, Christopher D.10aScaling of bite performance with head and carapace morphometrics in green turtles (Chelonia mydas)  ap. 91-97.  aAdult green turtles (Chelonia mydas) are unusual relative to other sea turtles in that they are predominately herbivorous. This herbivorous diet is reflected in the serrated morphology of their beak, bite performance and the relative morphometrics of their heads. Recent bite performance data in loggerhead turtles (Caretta caretta), which are known for their durophagous capability, have demonstrated that bite force is correlated with head morphometrics. The objective of this study was to characterize bite force in green turtles and correlate bite performance with head and carapace morphometrics. We predicted that maximum bite force in green turtles would be less in magnitude relative to loggerheads, but would be positively correlated with head morphometrics. Therefore, mass, straight carapace length, straight carapace width, greatest head width, height, and length were collected with bite force from free-ranging green turtles from Punta Abreojos, Baja California Sur, Mexico and Otsuchi, Japan. Subjects ranged from 10.9 to 48kg, with straight carapace length and width ranged from 40.6cm to 71.9cm (mean=56.3±8.5cm) and from 33.5cm to 55.9cm (mean=44.8±5.7cm), respectively. A bite force apparatus was used to collect bite performance from subjects. The maximum bite force was 303N. Mean head width, head height, and head length were 8.7±1.2, 8.2±1.1, and 11.5±1.5cm, respectively. Bite force was lower in magnitude than reported for loggerhead turtles as predicted but still strong enough to process algal and plant matter, as well as crush many hard prey items. Simultaneous measurements of body and head size, and the use of non-linear reduced major axis regression, show that bite force scaled isometrically relative to body size and head size. Simple correlation showed that all logged transformed morphometrics were good predictors of logged bite performance, but an AICc-based weighted regression showed that body mass, followed by head width and head height, were better predictors of bite force than carapace size.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCaretta caretta 3aChelonia mydas 3aadults 3aalgae 3abeak 3abody measurements 3acorrelation 3adiet 3aherbivores 3amorphometry 3asea turtles 3aJapan 3aMexico 0aBite force 0aFeeding Performance 0aMarine turtles 0aMorphometrics 0aChelonia1 aWang, John1 aRocha-Olivares, Axayácatl,1 aGodínez Reyes, Carlos,1 aFisler, Shara1 aNarazaki, Tomoko1 aSato, Katsufumi1 aSterba-Boatwright, Blair D.0 tJournal of experimental marine biology and ecology.g2014 Feb., v. 451 p.91-97dElsevier B.V.aElsevier B.V.wJournal:11705x0022-09817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jembe.2013.11.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01451naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002300139245011400162300001600276520050400292592002800796650002300824650002300847650001700870650001800887650001200905650002200917700002300939773010300962856007501065852000901140655001201149IND60578643120221118024637.0170813e20130201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057864312DNAL7 a10.1021/ol303465c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBess, Elizabeth N.10aDistinctive Meta-Directing Group Effect for Iridium-Catalyzed 1,1-Diarylalkene Enantioselective Hydrogenation  ap. 646-649.  aAn iridium-catalyzed asymmetric hydrogenation of 1,1-diarylkenes is described.

We demonstrated its utilization for protein expression, localization, protein–protein interaction, and the investigation of PCD-related processes. Plant protoplasts are an important and versatile cell system that is widely used in the analysis of gene characterization and diverse signaling pathways. Programmed cell death (PCD) occurs throughout the life of plants from embryogenesis to fertilization. The maize nucellus undergoes typical PCD during development of the embryo sac. The nucellus protoplast shows potential for use in research of PCD-related processes. No studies have reported previously the isolation and transfection of nucellus protoplasts. In this study, conditions for the isolation and transfection of maize nucellus protoplasts were established. The maize protoplast system can be used for protein expression, localization, and protein–protein interaction. We applied this system to investigate PCD-related processes. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis revealed that transient expression of MADS29 in the maize nucellus protoplast increases Cys-protease gene transcript level. In addition, β-glucuronidase and luciferase activity assays showed that MADS29 could enhance the promoter activities of the Cys-protease gene. Thus, we demonstrated the potential of a highly efficient maize nucellus protoplast system for transient gene expression and investigation of PCD-related processes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aapoptosis 3aassays 3abeta-glucuronidase 3acorn 3aembryo sac 3aembryogenesis 3agene expression 3agenes 3aluciferase 3amessenger RNA 3anucellus 3aprotein synthesis 3aprotein-protein interactions 3aprotoplasts 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3asignal transduction 3atransfection1 aYi, Qiang1 aSong, Qiaoheng1 aGu, Yong1 aZhang, Junjie1 aHu, Yufeng1 aLiu, Hanmei1 aLiu, Yinghong1 aYu, Guowu1 aHuang, Yubi0 tPlant cell reports.g2015 July, v. 34, no. 7 p.1239-1251dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx0721-77147nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00299-015-1783-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02561naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001300140245008300153300001400236500002000250520138400270592002801654650002201682650002001704650001001724650002401734650001301758650001501771650001401786650002001800650001501820650001501835650001101850650002401861651001101885700002601896700001701922773012801939856007502067852000902142655001202151IND60787146420221120212251.0220807e201901  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078714642DNAL7 a10.1002/jwmg.215802doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYue, Sam10aInforming snake roadkill mitigation strategies in Taiwan using citizen science  ap. 80-88.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aDespite their prevalence in roadkill in East Asia, there has been little research on snake mortality along roads, even though the region's fauna contains some of the highest proportions of threatened or data‐deficient reptiles. We analyzed citizen‐collected roadkill data from Taiwan, comprising >11,000 records of snake roadkill from 2006–2017. We used maximum entropy environmental niche modeling to predict roadkill sighting patterns across snake species differing in habitat use, foraging behavior, and taxonomic group. Roadkill sightings were highest in low to mid‐elevation (i.e., 0–2,000 m) forests and strips of farmland or shrubland that cut through forests; these areas likely support high snake abundances or dispersal activity. Sightings were lowest in urban areas and at high elevations (i.e., >2,000 m), likely because of unfavorable habitat conditions. Road density had little influence on roadkill sightings; areas with dense roads may be of lower habitat quality and contain fewer snakes. Roadkill sighting patterns differed among snake species with different habitat use and behavior. Natural history and landscape factors should be considered in roadkill mitigation design to reduce snake roadkill effectively. We recommend the use of similar citizen‐science projects elsewhere to supplement conservation planning. © 2018 The Wildlife Society.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural land 3acitizen science 3afauna 3ahabitat preferences 3ahabitats 3alandscapes 3amortality 3anatural history 3aroad kills 3ashrublands 3asnakes 3awildlife management 3aTaiwan1 aBonebrake, Timothy C.1 aGibson, Luke0 tjournal of wildlife management.g2019 Jan., v. 83, no. 1 p.80-88dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl46144x0022-541X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jwmg.215803Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02580naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100006000147245008600207300001400293520123200307592002801539650001501567650002101582650001301603650001501616650002501631650002101656650001701677650003101694650001301725650001401738653001701752653002701769653001401796653002001810700001901830700001701849700002101866700001801887700002701905700001901932773008101951856008102032852000902113655001202122IND60569017020221119170421.0170709e20170701xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056901702DNAL7 a10.1016/j.lfs.2017.05.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKhan, Abdul Arif1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8748-184110aColorectal cancer-inflammatory bowel disease nexus and felony of Escherichia coli  ap. 60-67.  aColorectal cancer (CRC) has a multifactorial etiology. Although the exact cause of CRC is still elusive, recent studies have indicated microbial involvement in its etiology. Escherichia coli has emerged as an important factor in CRC development since the bacterium can cause changes in the gut that lead to cancerous transformation. A number of studies indicate that chronic inflammation induced by microorganisms, including E. coli, during inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) predisposes an individual to CRC. The evidence that support the role of E. coli in the etiology of CRC, through IBD, is not limited only to chronic inflammation. The growth of E. coli as an intracellular pathogen during IBD and CRC enable the bacteria to modulate the host cell cycle, induce DNA damage and accumulate mutations. These are some of the contributing factors behind the etiology of CRC. The present article considers the current status of the involvement of E. coli, through IBD, in the etiology of CRC. We discuss how intracellular E. coli infection can cause changes in the gut that can eventually lead to cellular transformation. In addition, the recent management strategies that target E. coli for prevention of CRC are also discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA damage 3aEscherichia coli 3abacteria 3acell cycle 3acolorectal neoplasms 3adigestive system 3ainflammation 3ainflammatory bowel disease 3amutation 3apathogens 0aInflammation 0aIntracellular pathogen 0aInfection 0aCancer etiology1 aKhān, Jākir,1 aMalik, Abdul1 aKalam, Mohd Abul1 aCash, Phillip1 aAshraf, Mohd.

This study investigates the protective effects of different compatibility proportions of AR and ASR on cardiac dysfunction in a C57BL/6 mouse model of myocardial infarction (MI). MI mice were induced by ligation of the left coronary artery and divided into six groups: sham, vehicle, 10 mg/kg/d simvastatin and combinations of AR and ASR at different ratios, including 1:1 (AR 2.5 g/kg + ASR 2.5 g/kg), 3:1 (AR 3.75 g/kg + ASR 1.25 g/kg) and 5:1 (AR 4.17 g/kg + ASR 0.83 g/kg). Both AR–ASR combinations and simvastatin were dissolved in saline solution and given daily by gavage. The left ventricle function, infarct size, heart tissue injury, apoptosis of cardiomyocytes, leukocyte infiltrates, capillary density and expression of cleaved caspase-3, cleaved caspase-9, Bcl-2, Bax, Bad, IL-1β, IL-6, VEGF, p-Akt and p-eNOS were analysed. Different combinations of AR and ASR improve cardiac function and reduce infarct size (61.15% vs. 39.3%, 42.65% and 45.5%) and tissue injury through different mechanisms. When AR was combined with ASR at ratio of 1:1, the inflammation and cardiomyocyte apoptosis were suppressed (p < 0.05, p < 0.01). The combination ratio of 3:1 exerted effect in promoting angiogensis (p < 0.05). In the combination of AR and ASR at 5:1 ratio, angiogenesis was significantly improved (p < 0.01) and the apoptosis was inhibited (p < 0.05). Our results reflect the regulation of multiple targets and links in herb pairs and provide an important basis for the use of AR and ASR combinations in the treatment of MI.  aThis study was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China [Grant number: 81603329], Program of International S&T Cooperation Project of China [Grant number: 2015DFA30430] and Natural Science Foundation of Tianjin Municipal Government [Grant number: 16JCZDJC36300].  aPublisher supplied data  a81603329a2015DFA30430  a16JCZDJC36300 3aAngelica sinensis 3aangiogenesis 3aapoptosis 3acardiac output 3acardiomyocytes 3acaspase-3 3acaspase-9 3acoronary vessels 3ainfarction 3ainflammation 3ainterleukin-6 3aleukocytes 3amice 3amyocardial infarction 3asimvastatin 3asodium chloride 0aApoptosis 0ainflammation 0aangiogenesis1 aSong, Min1 aZhang, Lusha1 aLi, Chunxiao1 aFang, Zhirui1 aCoffie, Joel Wake1 aZhang, Liyuan1 aMa, Lulu1 aFang, Leyu1 aWang, Chian Yi,1 aYang, Wenjie1 aLi, Fanggang1 aGao, Xiumei1 aWang, Hong0 tPharmaceutical biology.g2020 Jan. 1, v. 58, no. 1 p.165-175dTaylor & FranciswJournal:2153x1744-51167nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13880209.2020.17255813Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02274naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002600146245015800172300002000330520090600350592002801256650001601284650001701300650002101317650001501338650002201353650002001375650001801395650002301413650001701436700002101453700001601474700005501490700005701545700006001602773013701662856008001799852000901879655001201888IND60606170820221120185143.0180724e20180521xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060617082DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.8b033062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAboelazm, Eslam A.

In the presence of magnetic field, well-defined hierarchical Co₃O₄ nanostructures with higher electroactive surface area are formed during the electrodeposition process. Electrochemical analysis shows that the enhanced Co₃O₄ nanostructures exhibit excellent charge storage capabilities of 1273 F g–¹ at 1 A g–¹, approximately 4 times higher than the electrodeposited Co₃O₄ that is formed without magnetic field effect. It also reveals the high cycling stability of enhanced Co₃O₄ nanostructures, with 96% capacitance retention at 5000 charge discharge cycles. The results manifest the enhancement of Co₃O₄ recovery from spent lithium-ion batteries, which can be the potential electrode material for supercapacitor application.  aPublisher supplied data 3acapacitance 3acobalt oxide 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3alithium batteries 3amagnetic fields 3ananomaterials 3aphysical chemistry 3asurface area1 aAli, Gomaa A.

Simultaneously, we aimed at sustaining the stability of viscosity, representing the physicochemical state of beta-glucan. Total folate contents were determined microbiologically and vitamers for selected samples by UHPLC.Folate in yeast cells comprised mainly 5-methyltetrahydrofolate and tetrahydrofolate. Folate production by microbes in YPD medium was different to that in cereal fermentations where vitamers included 5-methyltetrahydrofolate, 5,10-methenyltetrahydrofolate and formylated derivatives. Microbes producing significant amounts of folate without affecting viscosity were Saccharomyces cerevisiae ALKO743 and Candida milleri ABM4949 among yeasts and Pseudomonas sp. ON8 and Janthinobacterium sp. RB4 among bacteria. Net folate production was up to 120ng/g after 24h fermentation and could increase during 2-week storage. Glucose addition increased the proportion of 5-methyltetrahydrofolate. Streptococcus thermophilus ABM5097, Lactobacillus reuteri, and Propionibacterium sp. ABM5378 produced folate but in lower concentrations.Both endogenous and added microbes contribute to folate enhancement. Selection of microbes with folate producing capability and limited hydrolytic activity will enable the development of products rich in folate and beta-glucan.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCandida humilis 3aJanthinobacterium 3aLactobacillus reuteri 3aPropionibacterium 3aPseudomonas 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3aStreptococcus thermophilus 3abarley 3abeta-glucans 3afermentation 3aglucose 3alactic acid bacteria 3amodels 3aoat bran 3aoats 3atetrahydrofolic acid 3aviscosity 3ayeasts 0aFolate 0aFermentation 0aBarley 0aOat 0aBeta-glucan 0aViscosity1 aEdelmann, Minnamari1 aNyström, Laura1 aSontag-Strohm, Tuula1 aSalovaara, Hannu1 aKivelä, Reetta1 aHerranen, Mirkka1 aKorhola, Matti1 aPiironen, Vieno0 tInternational journal of food microbiology.g2014 Apr. 17, v. 176 p.38-48dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl35565x0168-16057nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijfoodmicro.2014.01.0183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03079naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002400150245014000174520176200314592002802076650001602104650002202120650001502142650001302157650001702170650002602187650001602213650002202229650002502251650001602276650001402292653001302306653003302319653001902352653001902371653002402390653001202414700001802426773011902444856008502563852000902648655001202657IND60771893220221120164858.0220621e202207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077189322DNAL7 a10.1016/j.susmat.2022.e004232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSingh, Aswani Kumar12aA comparative appraisal of sustainable strategy in Ultrasonic Assisted Grinding of Nimonic 80A using novel green atomized cutting fluid  aThe grinding of nickel-based super-alloys creates enormous challenges during machining in the form of low thermal conductivity, high strength, and toughness at elevated temperatures. Besides this, the emissions from cutting fluids and their disposal are also a concern for the environment. In order to overcome these problems associated with Conventional Grinding (CG), the present research attempt focuses on modifying the mechanism of the grinding process by harnessing the dual advantages of Ultrasonic Assisted Grinding (UAG) and ultrasonically atomized novel green cutting fluid to achieve better performance and enhanced sustainability. The investigations of cutting forces, Coefficient of Friction (CoF), surface integrity, and chip morphology have been done for different grinding approaches. Then, based on the acquired data, a comparative study has been carried out to investigate the effect of ultrasonic vibration and atomized cutting fluid on the CG operation. A significant reduction in grinding forces by 66.22% and 52.66% for normal and tangential cutting force, respectively, and surface roughness by 46.48% has been observed during Ultrasonic Assisted Grinding with Ultrasonically Atomized Fluid (UaFUAG) as compared to the CG. Moreover, minimum CoF has been seen in the UaFUAG process with a reduction of 30.42% as compared to CG. Further, Life Cycle Analysis (LCA) of different grinding processes has been performed by taking three indicators, viz. human health, ecology, and ecosystem. Subsequently, the Product Sustainability Index (PSI) study was evaluated, and the UaFUAG strategy was found 46.06% more sustainable than the CG process. This result can be a contributing step towards the realization of sustainable grinding processes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aatomization 3acomparative study 3aecosystems 3afriction 3ahuman health 3alife cycle assessment 3asuperalloys 3asurface roughness 3athermal conductivity 3aultrasonics 3avibration 0aGrinding 0aUltrasonic assisted grinding 0aAtomized fluid 0aSustainability 0aLife cycle analysis 0aNimonic1 aSharma, Varun0 tSustainable materials and technologies.g2022 July, v. 32 p.e00423-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23531x2214-99377nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.susmat.2022.e004233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02383naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001900152245008700171300001800258520131200276592002801588650000801616650001701624650002401641650001101665650001101676650001501687650002201702650001501724650001501739650001801754651002101772700001901793700002001812773008201832856008601914852000902000655001202009IND60084979320221119171923.0141101e201302  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008497932DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apenergy.2012.09.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJung, Sungmoon10aWind energy potential assessment considering the uncertainties due to limited data  ap. 1492-1503.  aA new Bayesian approach is proposed to estimate the annual energy production (AEP) of a site where construction of wind turbines is considered. The approach uses long-term wind speeds of a nearby weather station and short-term wind speeds near the target site. Uncertainties exist due to the limited amount of data in the target site, in addition to the inherent uncertainties in the wind speed, the air density, the surface roughness exponent, and the power performance of the turbine. The proposed method systematically addresses these uncertainties and provides the distribution of the AEP. For illustration, we used the wind speed data near Yeosu, Korea, and the power performance curve of a 3MW turbine. For the site and the turbine studied, the range given by the 95% confidence interval corresponded to 8.9% of the mean AEP, and the range given by the 99% confidence interval corresponded to 11.9% of the mean AEP. Benefits of using the Bayesian approach compared to the classical statistical inference was also illustrated with the case study. The proposed approach provides a more conservative estimation considering the uncertainties due to the limited amount of data. Distributions of parameters of the prediction model are also provided, which enables a more detailed analysis of the prediction.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3acase studies 3aconfidence interval 3aenergy 3amodels 3aprediction 3asurface roughness 3awind power 3awind speed 3awind turbines 3aKorean Peninsula1 aArda Vanli, O.1 aKwon, Soon-Duck0 tApplied energy.g2013 Feb., v. 102 p.1492-1503dElsevier Ltdx0306-26197nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2012.09.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02427naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100006600149245010100215300001800316520126200334592002801596650001201624650001001636650001301646650001101659650001101670650001701681650001701698650001301715650001601728700002501744700002701769700005801796773011801854856008401972852000902056655001202065IND60783230320220719000000.0220719e20220624xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078323032DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.biochem.2c001842doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aElenbaas, Barend O.

This loss is thought to be a consequence of membrane disruption, caused by the aggregation of islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP) into amyloid fibrils. However, the molecular mechanisms of IAPP aggregation in the presence of membranes have remained unclear. Here, we use kinetic analysis to elucidate the aggregation mechanism of IAPP in the presence of mixed zwitterionic and anionic lipid membranes. The results converge to a model in which aggregation on the membrane is strongly dominated by secondary nucleation, that is, the formation of new nuclei on the surface of existing fibrils. The critical nucleus consists of a single IAPP molecule, and anionic lipids catalyze both primary and secondary nucleation, but not elongation. The fact that anionic lipids promote secondary nucleation implies that these events take place at the interface between the membrane and existing fibrils, demonstrating that fibril growth occurs at least to some extent on the membrane surface. These new insights into the mechanism of IAPP aggregation on membranes may help to understand IAPP toxicity and will be important for the development of therapeutics to prevent β-cell death in type II diabetes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aamyloid 3adeath 3akinetics 3alipids 3amodels 3apolypeptides 3atherapeutics 3atoxicity 3azwitterions1 aKhemtemourian, Lucie1 aKillian, J.

Consequently because it is a primary source of energy, due to its higher level of inclusion in poultry diets (60-70%), it contributes approximately 30% of the protein requirement of poultry. However, maize, like other cereals, is deficient in certain essential amino acids, such as lysine and tryptophan. Therefore, to meet the requirements of these essential amino acids, farmers and feed producers usually supplement poultry rations with synthetic amino acids. Quality protein maize (QPM), with almost double the lysine and tryptophan levels, is no different from that of normal maize (NM) in terms of the quantity of energy and protein it contains. Consequently, inclusion of QPM in poultry formulations will enable the feed manufacturer to produce feeds requiring minimal or no additional supplementation of crystalline amino acids particularly lysine and tryptophan. This review examines the available research on the nutritional value of QPM in poultry for its commercial exploitation as a feed material.  aPublisher supplied data 3acorn 3adiet 3aenergy 3aessential amino acids 3aessential fatty acids 3afarmers 3afeed formulation 3afeeds 3alysine 3anutritive value 3apigments 3apoultry 3aprotein requirement 3atryptophan 0aquality protein maize 0anutritive value 0apoultry1 aPRAKASH, B.1 aRAMA RAO, S.V.1 aRAJU, M.V.L.N.1 aSHYAM SUNDER, G.0 tWorld's poultry science journal.g2013 Dec., v. 69, no. 4 p.877-888dCambridge University Press on behalf of World&#x0027;s Poultry Science AssociationwJournal:jnl45575x1743-47777nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S00439339130008713Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03981naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100005800145245007700203300001800280500002000298520245800318592002802776650003402804650002502838650001302863650001702876650002502893650001702918650001802935650002402953650001602977650001702993650001103010650004303021650002003064650002103084650001903105650001903124650002503143650001603168650001203184700002503196700002503221700002803246773012503274856007903399852000903478655001203487IND60608865720221117223308.0180813e201808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060886572DNAL7 a10.1111/1750-3841.142842doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNowak, Dariusz1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5493-194910aAntioxidant Properties and Phenolic Compounds of Vitamin C‐Rich Juices  ap. 2237-2246.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aMany studies have shown that bioactive compounds, for example, polyphenols, and so on can play an important role in reducing oxidative stress and protect against various diseases. The sources of these compounds in the human diet include mainly fruit and good quality fruit juices, which may contain polyphenols but also other phytochemicals such as vitamin C. The purpose of the study was to analyze the antioxidant properties of vitamin C‐rich juices, which underwent mild processing. The content of total polyphenols (TP, FBBB), total flavonoids (TF), total anthocyanins (TA), and vitamin C as well as the antioxidant capacity (DPPH, ABTS) were evaluated in commercial fruit juices rich in vitamin C (acerola, gojiberry, sea buckthorn, wild rose, cranberry, Japanese quince). Moreover, phenolic acids and selected flavonoids were determined by HPLC methods. Among the examined fruit juices, acerola and wild rose juices contained the highest amounts of vitamin C and total polyphenols, and had the highest antioxidant capacity. Acerola owes its high antioxidant properties mainly to vitamin C, whereas the antioxidant capacity of wild rose is also attributed to its rich content of flavonoids and phenolic acids. Sea buckthorn juice and Japanese quince juice had a lower antioxidant capacity, yet higher than determined for gojiberry and cranberry juices. Total anthocyanins were the highest in cranberry juice. The results showed that the analyzed juices were a valuable source of natural antioxidants. Generally, vitamin C‐rich juices are also good source of polyphenols. Vitamin C and polyphenols act synergistically and define the antioxidant properties of juices. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: Bioactive compounds, for example, polyphenols play an important role in reducing oxidative stress and protect against various diseases. Sources of natural antioxidants in human diet include mainly fruit and good quality fruit juices. The study showed that the juices from acerola, gojiberry, sea buckthorn, wild rose, cranberry, Japanese quince were a valuable source of natural polyphenols and vitamin C. These compounds act synergistically and define the antioxidant properties of juices. Among all examined samples, acerola and wild rose juices seem to be the most valuable. Moreover, it's worth noticing that juices underwent mild processing (cold pressed and low pasteurization) retained more bioactive compounds, which affected their higher quality.  aPublisher supplied data 3a2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl 3aHippophae rhamnoides 3aacerolas 3aanthocyanins 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3aascorbic acid 3abioactive compounds 3acranberries 3afruit juices 3afruits 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3ahuman nutrition 3aoxidative stress 3apasteurization 3aphenolic acids 3aphytopharmaceuticals 3apolyphenols 3aquinces1 aGośliński, Michał1 aWojtowicz, Elżbieta1 aPrzygoński, Krzysztof,0 tJournal of food science.g2018 Aug., v. 83, no. 8 p.2237-2246dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl48587x0022-11477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1750-3841.142843Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02006naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245008500158300002000243500002000263520095200283592002801235650001801263650001101281650002701292650001601319650001501335650002401350700001801374700002801392700002301420773014201443856007401585852000901659655001201668IND60651739020221119233624.0190712e20150929xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065173902DNAL7 a10.3390/su710133512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChoi, Jin Ouk10aLEED Credit Review System and Optimization Model for Pursuing LEED Certification  ap. 13351-13377.  aJournal Article  aIncorporating sustainability in construction can result in desirable building attributes and project life cycle.

In these insects, one of the metabolic adaptations to cold stress is the synthesis of responsive proteins. Using proteomic analysis, an investigation aimed to a better understanding of the molecular adaptation mechanisms to cold stress was carried out in Ostrinia furnacalis larva. Proteins were extracted from the larval hemolymph collected from both control and overwintering larva. By polyethylene glycol precipitation, approximately 560 protein spots were separated and visualized on two‐dimensional (2D) gels after silver staining. Eighteen protein spots were found to be upregulated in overwinter larval plasma in different patterns. As an initial work, 13 of these proteins were identified using MALDI TOF/TOF MS. The differentially overexpressed proteins include heat shock 70 kDa cognate protein, small heat shock protein (sHSP), putative aliphatic nitrilase, arginine kinase, phosphoglyceromutase, triosephosphateisomerase, and glutathione transferase. Alterations in the levels of these proteins were further confirmed by qPCR. This study is the first analysis of differentially expressed plasma proteins in O. furnacalis diapause larvae under extremely low temperature conditions and gives new insights into the acclimation mechanisms responsive to cold stress. Our results also support the idea that energy metabolism, alanine and proline metabolism, and antioxidative reaction act in the cold acclimation of O. furnacalis diapause larvae.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOstrinia furnacalis 3aacclimation 3aalanine 3aarginine kinase 3ablood proteins 3acold 3acold stress 3adiapause 3aenergy metabolism 3agels 3agene expression regulation 3aglutathione transferase 3aheat shock proteins 3ahemolymph 3ainsects 3alarvae 3anitrilase 3aoverwintering 3apolyethylene glycol 3aproline 3aproteomics 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3asilver 3atemperate zones 3atemperature1 aPan, Yiou1 aPeng, Tianfei1 aYang, Shuang1 aLu, Xin1 aWang, Zhenying1 aXi, Jinghui0 tArchives of insect biochemistry and physiology.g2015 Dec., v. 90, no. 4 p.195-208dAlan R.

Not only do POM-OFs present a wide range of configurable structures, but also a have a vast array of physical properties which reflect the properties of the various ‘modular’ molecular inputs. Here we describe the methodologies that can be used to construct POM-OF materials with important catalytic, electronic, and structural properties and discuss the advantages compared to the metal organic framework analogues. We also show that it is possible to construct POM-OF materials and design and/or fine tune their functionality by manipulating the initially generated building block libraries as well as by controlling the self-assembly towards the specific intermediate (POM) species which is the chemical and structural “information” carrier of the targeted POM-OF material.  aPublisher supplied data 3aarchitecture 3acoordination polymers 3aphysical properties 3atopology1 aVilà-Nadal, Laia1 aCronin, Leroy0 tChemical Society reviews.g2014 July 21, v. 43, no. 16 p.5679-5699dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:20471x1460-47447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c4cs00097h3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01483naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100005900140245004700199300001600246500002000262520053900282592002800821596006400849650001300913650001000926650001200936650001600948650001600964773011700980856007501097852000901172655001201181IND60775716520221121221756.0220427e202205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077571652DNAL7 a10.1002/ppp3.102612doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSuetsugu, Kenji1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7943-416410aArisaema: Pollination by lethal attraction  ap. 196-200.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aFemale individuals in the genus Arisaema are the only plants known to imprison their pollinators permanently.

Calculation of lava flow volume from thermal images collected by helicopter surveys has been largely used during the last decade for monitoring subaerial effusive eruptions. However, due to the depths where volcanic activity occurs, monitoring submarine volcanic eruptions is a very difficult task. The 2011–2012 submarine volcanic eruption at El Hierro, Canary Islands, has provided a unique and excellent opportunity to monitor eruptive processes occurring on the seabed. The use of a hand-held thermal camera during daily helicopter flights allowed us to estimate for the first time the daily and total erupted magma volumes from a submarine eruption. The volume of magma emitted during this eruption has been estimated at 300Mm3, giving an average effusion rate of ~25m3s−1. Thermal imagery by helicopter proved to be a fast, inexpensive, safe and reliable technique of monitoring volcanic eruptions when they occur on the shallow seabed.  aPublisher supplied data 3acameras 3aimage analysis 3alava 3amonitoring 3aremote sensing 3asurveys 3avolcanic activity 3aCanary Islands 0aShallow submarine eruption 0aThermal airborne monitoring 0aErupted volume 0aEffusion rate 0aEl Hierro 0aCanary Islands1 aCalvari, Sonia1 aRamos, António,1 aPérez, Nemesio M.,1 aMárquez, Antonio,1 aQuevedo, Roberto1 aBarrancos, José1 aPadrón, Eleazar1 aPadilla, Germán D.1 aLópez, Dina1 aRodríguez Santana, Angel,1 aMelián, Gladys V.1 aDionis, Samara1 aRodríguez, Fátima1 aCalvo, David1 aSpampinato, Letizia0 tRemote sensing of environment.g2014 Nov., v. 154 p.219-225dElsevier Inc.x0034-42577nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rse.2014.08.0273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02333naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001600152245013000168300001800298520134800316592002801664650000801692650001501700650001901715650003101734650000901765650001601774650001101790700001501801700001401816773008201830856008601912852000901998655001202007IND60084979520221119171947.0141101e201302  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008497952DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apenergy.2012.09.0182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, H.G.12aA performance analysis of a novel system of a dual loop bottoming organic Rankine cycle (ORC) with a light-duty diesel engine  ap. 1504-1513.  aA small-scale organic Rankine cycle (ORC) can be used to harness the waste heat from an internal combustion engine. In this paper, the characteristic of a novel system combining a vehicular light-duty diesel engine with a dual loop ORC, which recovers waste heat from the engine exhaust, intake air, and coolant, is analyzed. A high temperature loop recovers the exhaust heat, whereas a low temperature loop recovers the residual heat from the high temperature loop and the waste heat from both the intake air and the coolant. A performance map of the light-duty diesel engine is created using an engine test bench. The heat waste from the exhaust, the intake air, and the coolant are calculated and compared throughout the engine’s entire operating region. Based on these data, the working parameters of the dual loop ORC are defined, and the performance of the combined engine–ORC system is evaluated across this entire region. The results show that the net power of the low temperature loop is higher than that of the high temperature loop, and the relative output power improves from 14% to 16% in the peak effective thermal efficiency region and from 38% to 43% in the small load region. In addition, the brake specific fuel consumption (bsfc) of the combined system decreases significantly throughout the engine’s operating region.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3acombustion 3adiesel engines 3aenergy use and consumption 3aheat 3atemperature 3awastes1 aWang, E.H.1 aFan, B.Y.0 tApplied energy.g2013 Feb., v. 102 p.1504-1513dElsevier Ltdx0306-26197nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2012.09.0183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02671naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002700150245011800177300001800295520126000313592002801573650001901601650001101620650001301631650001701644650001501661650001301676700002001689700002401709700006301733700002501796700006101821700006301882700007001945700005802015773011902073856008402192852000902276655001202285IND60631501920221123032154.0190226e20190206xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063150192DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.macromol.8b024972doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMaroon, Christopher R.10aElimination of CO₂/N₂ Langmuir Sorption and Promotion of “N₂-Phobicity” within High-Tg Glassy Membranes  ap. 1589-1600.  aWe demonstrate that the CO₂/N₂ gas separation performance of alkoxysilyl-substituted vinyl-added polynorbornenes (VAPNBs) may be significantly enhanced via incorporation of the monomer 5-tris(2-methoxyethoxy)silyl-2-norbornene. As the molar ratio of this monomer is increased, substantial increases in CO₂/N₂ selectivity are realized with minimal decrease in CO₂ permeability. This trend ignores the traditional permeability/selectivity “trade-off” relationship and yields an optimal membrane whose performance reaches the 2008 upper bound for CO₂/N₂ separations. Though the inclusion of 5-tris(2-methoxyethoxy)-silyl-2-norbornene units was initially hypothesized to maximize CO₂ solubility, detailed gas sorption studies reveal that these highly glassy materials essentially lack any Langmuir sorption component and indicate that their improved CO₂/N₂ selectivity is due to decreased N₂ solubility within the matrix. Computational modeling suggests that the source of this apparent “N₂-phobicity” is likely explained through comparative analyses of polymer–polymer and polymer–gas interactions. Lastly, mixed-gas permeation tests are performed to provide a more realistic look at real-world gas separation performance.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon dioxide 3amodels 3anitrogen 3apermeability 3asolubility 3asorption1 aTownsend, Jacob1 aGmernicki, Kevin R.1 aHarrigan, Daniel J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5541-34811 aSundell, Benjamin J.1 aLawrence, John A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8159-06361 aMahurin, Shannon M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3792-16311 aVogiatzis, Konstantinos D.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7439-38501 aLong, Brian K.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2691-61940 tMacromolecules.g2019 Feb. 06, v. 52, no. 4 p.1589-1600dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23616x1520-58357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.macromol.8b024973Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04259naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002400155245017800179300001400357520266700371592002803038650001803066650000803084650001003092650002203102650001903124650001003143650002003153650001403173650001703187650000903204650002703213650002303240650001003263650001003273650001203283650002503295650001603320653002303336653001803359653000803377653002003385653001903405700002003424700001603444700002203460700002003482773012803502856009003630852000903720655001203729IND60541114620221120051635.0190318e20140417xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054111462DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijfoodmicro.2014.02.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMusavian, Hanieh S.10aCombined steam and ultrasound treatment of broilers at slaughter: A promising intervention to significantly reduce numbers of naturally occurring campylobacters on carcasses  ap. 23-28.  aSteam or hot water decontamination treatment of broiler carcasses is hampered by process limitations due to prolonged treatment times and adverse changes to the epidermis. In this study, a combination of steam with ultrasound (SonoSteam®) was investigated on naturally contaminated broilers that were processed at conventional slaughter speeds of 8,500 birds per hour in a Danish broiler plant. Industrial-scale SonoSteam equipment was installed in the evisceration room, before the inside/outside carcass washer. The SonoSteam treatment was evaluated in two separate trials performed on two different dates. Numbers of naturally occurring Campylobacter spp. and TVC were determined from paired samples of skin excised from opposite sides of the breast of the same carcass, before and after treatments. Sampling was performed at two different points on the line: i) before and after the SonoSteam treatment and ii) before the SonoSteam treatment and after 80min of air chilling. A total of 44 carcasses were examined in the two trials. Results from the first trial showed that the mean initial Campylobacter contamination level of 2.35 log10 CFU was significantly reduced (n=12, p<0.001) to 1.40 log10 CFU after treatment. A significant reduction (n=11, p<0.001) was also observed with samples analyzed before SonoSteam treatment (2.64 log10 CFU) and after air chilling (1.44 log10 CFU).In the second trial, significant reductions (n=10, p<0.05) were obtained for carcasses analyzed before (mean level of 2.23 log10 CFU) and after the treatment (mean level of 1.36 log10 CFU). Significant reductions (n=11, p<0.01) were also found for Campylobacter numbers analyzed before the SonoSteam treatment (2.02 log10 CFU) and after the air chilling treatment (1.37 log10 CFU). The effect of air chilling without SonoSteam treatment was determined using 12 carcasses pre- and postchill. Results showed insignificant reductions of 0.09 log10 from a mean initial level of 2.19 log10 CFU.Numbers of TVC before treatments ranged between 3.47 and 4.79 log10 CFU. In all cases, TVC was significantly (p<0.001, n=45 in each trial) reduced by approximately 0.7 log10 CFU.An authorized sensory panel at the Danish Veterinary and Food Administration concluded that broiler carcasses treated with SonoSteam were acceptable for purchase. These conclusions were based on organoleptic differences (smell, skin/meat consistency, texture and color) of treated vs. untreated carcasses.Results obtained from this study suggest that steam–ultrasound treatment of carcasses at broiler processing plants can significantly reduce numbers of Campylobacter on naturally contaminated broilers.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCampylobacter 3aair 3abirds 3achicken carcasses 3acold treatment 3acolor 3adecontamination 3aequipment 3aevisceration 3ameat 3ameat processing plants 3asensory evaluation 3asmell 3asteam 3atexture 3aultrasonic treatment 3aultrasonics 0aSteam–ultrasound 0aCampylobacter 0aTVC 0aBroiler carcass 0aSlaughterhouse1 aKrebs, Niels H.1 aNonboe, Ulf1 aCorry, Janet E.L.1 aPurnell, Graham0 tInternational journal of food microbiology.g2014 Apr. 17, v. 176 p.23-28dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl35565x0168-16057nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijfoodmicro.2014.02.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02783naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245012900170520143400299592002801733650002401761650001501785650001601800650001001816650000901826650001101835650001501846650002201861650001601883650002201899650001801921653002701939653001501966653001601981653001901997653001402016653003202030700002602062700001802088700001802106773011902124856008502243852000902328655001202337IND60771893520221120164844.0220621e202207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077189352DNAL7 a10.1016/j.susmat.2022.e004262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMadani, Sepideh10aSimulation of perovskite solar cells using molybdenum oxide thin films as interfacial layer for enhancing device performance  aOrganic-inorganic hybrid perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have the issue of interdiffusion at the interfaces that causes undesirable phenomena affecting device efficiency and stability. In this paper, we have investigated MoOₓ thin films as interlayer between the hole transport material and gold electrode and develop a model using the SCAPS solar cell simulator as a function of the interlayer film thickness to enhance device efficiency and stability. First, different thicknesses (2, 5, 10, 50, and 100 nm) of MoOₓ films were deposited on glass substrate by electron beam evaporation (e-beam) and their physical, chemical, optical, and electronic properties for PSC were examined. In this research, uniform, homogeneous and pinhole free MoOₓ films with high transmittance (˃ 80%), very low surface roughness, and resistivity were obtained from the 5 and 10 nm thick samples. In addition, the 10 nm film has shown the lowest photoluminescence emission. Using SCAPS solar cell simulation software and including MoOₓ thin films as passivation layer, the performance of the PSCs for a Pb-based and Pb-free perovskite absorber were modelled. Results showed that the 10 nm MoOₓ film is found to provide the best benefit to the device performance with enhanced power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 16.9% and 12.4% for the lead-based MAPb(I₁₋ₓBrₓ)₃ and lead-free (MASnI₃) perovskite solar cells, respectively.  aPublisher supplied data 3acomputer simulation 3aelectrodes 3aevaporation 3aglass 3agold 3amodels 3amolybdenum 3aphotoluminescence 3asolar cells 3asurface roughness 3atransmittance 0aPerovskite solar cells 0aInterfaces 0aPassivation 0aMoOx thin film 0aStability 0aSCAPS solar cell simulation1 aTesfamichael, Tuquabo1 aMotta, Nunzio1 aWang, Hongxia0 tSustainable materials and technologies.g2022 July, v. 32 p.e00426-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23531x2214-99377nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.susmat.2022.e004263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04353naa a2200721 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100007100140245007400211300001600285500002000301520219500321592002802516596003402544596002002578650002402598650001202622650001902634650001202653650001202665650001502677650000902692650001402701650001102715650002002726650000902746650001602755650001902771650001902790700001902809700002002828700002102848700002302869700002002892700002502912700002702937700001902964700001802983700002203001700002703023700002003050700005703070700003303127700002303160700001903183700001903202700004203221700002203263700002603285700002203311700002103333700001603354700001403370700002203384773011703406856007503523961001203598852000903610655001203619IND60775716720221121221849.0220427e202205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077571672DNAL7 a10.1002/ppp3.102402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEsperon‐Rodriguez, Manuel1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3649-213410aAssessing climate risk to support urban forests in a changing climate  ap. 201-213.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aSOCIETAL IMPACT STATEMENT: Globally, cities are planning for resilience through urban greening initiatives as governments understand the importance of urban forests in improving quality of life and mitigating climate change. However, the persistence of urban forests and the ecosystem benefits they provide are threatened by climate change, and systematic assessments of causes of tree dieback and mortality in urban environments are rare. Long‐term monitoring studies and adaptive management are needed to identify and prevent climate change‐driven failures and mortality. Research and monitoring when coupled with systematic forecasting will enable governments to incorporate climate change resilience into urban forestry planning. Future scenarios in which urban forests are resilient or in decline will depend on the management and planning actions we make today. SUMMARY: The management of urban forests is a key element of resilience planning in cities across the globe. Urban forests provide ecosystem services as well as other nature‐based solutions to 4.2 billion people living in cities. However, to continue to do so effectively, urban forests need to be able to thrive in an increasingly changing climate. Trees in cities are vulnerable to extreme heat and drought events, which are predicted to increase in frequency and severity under climate change. Knowledge of species' vulnerability to climate change, therefore, is crucial to ensure provision of desired ecosystem benefits, improve species selection, maintain tree growth and reduce tree mortality, dieback and stress in urban forests. Yet, systematic assessments of causes of tree dieback and mortality in urban environments are rare. We reviewed the state of knowledge of tree mortality in urban forests globally, finding very few frameworks that enable detection of climate change impacts on urban forests and no long‐term studies assessing climate change as a direct driver of urban tree dieback and mortality. The effects of climate change on urban forests remain poorly understood and quantified, constraining the ability of governments to incorporate climate change resilience into urban forestry planning.  aPublisher supplied data  cBiodivERsA COFUND 2015‐2016  cHort Innovation 3aadaptive management 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3adieback 3adrought 3aecosystems 3aheat 3amortality 3apeople 3aquality of life 3arisk 3atree growth 3atree mortality 3aurban forestry1 aRymer, Paul D.1 aPower, Sally A.1 aBarton, David N.1 aCariñanos, Paloma1 aDobbs, Cynnamon1 aEleuterio, Ana Alice1 aEscobedo, Francisco J.1 aHauer, Richard1 aHermy, Martin1 aJahānī, ʻAlī,1 aOnyekwelu, Jonathan C.1 aÖstberg, Johan1 aPataki, Diane1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7209-514X1 aRandrup, T.

In each herd, four batches consisting of four sows each with five ear-tagged piglets were included. Nasal swabs and/or blood were sampled from the sows and/or the piglets prior to farrowing and at weeks 1, 3, and 5 and at the end of the nursery period. Clinical examinations were performed at each sampling time. The sows and piglets were tested for IAV and IAV antibodies in nasal swabs and blood samples, respectively. The results revealed three enzootically infected herds, where the majority of the pigs were infected during the first 5 weeks after birth. Infected piglets of only 3 days of age were detected in the farrowing unit, where the sows were also shedding virus. In all herds, low to moderate numbers of infected pigs (ranging from 3.6 to 20.7%) were found to be virus positive in nasal swabs at two consecutive sampling times. Furthermore, clinical signs of respiratory disease were associated with IAV detection. The findings of this study documented that IAV can persist in herds and that piglets as young as 3 days can be infected despite the presence of maternally derived antibodies.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aInfluenza A virus 3aantibodies 3ablood 3ablood sampling 3aclinical examination 3afarrowing 3aherds 3alongitudinal studies 3anose 3apiglets 3arespiratory tract diseases 3asigns and symptoms (animals and humans) 3asows 3aviruses1 aLarsen, Inge1 aKristensen, Charlotte Sonne1 aKrog, Jesper Schak1 aWacheck, Silke1 aLarsen, Lars Erik0 tVeterinary research.g2019 Dec., v. 50, no. 1 p.36-36dBioMed CentralwJournal:jnl4142873x1297-97167nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13567-019-0655-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03238naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100006400147245015300211300001600364520158800380592002801968650002401996650003802020650003002058650002102088650002002109650001302129650001102142650001702153650000902170650000902179650001802188650001102206650001402217650002202231650001902253650001002272650002002282650001102302650001502313650000902328700002702337700002602364700002502390700002302415700002502438773016702463856008102630852000902711655001202720IND60644790420221116200008.0190522e201906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064479042DNAL7 a10.1007/s40093-018-0232-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOguntade, Oladele A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0825-508910aAssessment of composted kitchen waste and poultry manure amendments on growth, yield and heavy metal uptake by Jute mallow Corchorus olitorius Linn.  ap. 187-195.  aPURPOSE: This study was carried out to compare the effects of composted kitchen waste (KW) and poultry manure (PM) soil amendments on growth, yield and heavy metal uptake in edible leaf of Corchorus olitorius. METHODS: Kitchen waste and PM composted for 8 weeks were applied as soil amendment at the rate of 0 (no amendment), 5, 10 and 15 t ha⁻¹. Corchorus seeds were sown 2 weeks after incorporation of amendment. Compost amendments were the main treatments while application rates were in sub-plots. Treatments were replicated three times in a randomized complete block design. Corchorus were harvested 6 weeks after sowing, following which growth and yield parameters were measured. Concentrations of manganese (Mn), iron (Fe), copper (Cu) and zinc (Zn) in leaf tissue and plant uptake were also determined. RESULTS: Result showed that PM increased Corchorus leaf production than KW. Poultry manure significantly (p ≤ 0.01) increased Cu accumulation in leaf. Bioaccumulation of Cu was 0.005 and 0.011 mg kg⁻¹ for KW and PM, respectively. The metals except Zn in leaf tissue showed significant (p ≤ 0.01) correlation with both fresh and dry weights of Corchorus. Despite high concentration of heavy metals in the compost, bioaccumulation in leaf was lower than maximum allowable limit of 0.1 mg kg⁻¹ for Cu and 0.3 mg kg⁻¹ for Mn, Fe and Zn in vegetables by WHO/FAO/FEPA. CONCLUSION: Soil amended with composted KW and PM promoted Corchorus growth and yield. Accumulations of heavy metals in leaf tissue are within allowable limit for vegetables.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCorchorus olitorius 3aFood and Agriculture Organization 3aWorld Health Organization 3aapplication rate 3abioaccumulation 3acomposts 3acopper 3aheavy metals 3airon 3ajute 3akitchen waste 3aleaves 3amanganese 3amanure amendments 3apoultry manure 3aseeds 3asoil amendments 3asowing 3avegetables 3azinc1 aOlagbenro, Titilola S.1 aOdusanya, Olubunmi A.1 aOlagunju, Solomon O.1 aAdewusi, Kayode M.1 aAdegoke, Adedotun T.0 tInternational journal of recycling of organics waste in agriculture.g2019 June, v. 8, no. 2 p.187-195dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:21645x2195-32287nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s40093-018-0232-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02739naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001500140245015600155300002000311500002000331520150600351592002801857650001101885650002001896650002101916650002301937650002801960650003001988650002402018650001902042651001002061700001602071700001102087700001602098700001402114773014202128856007402270852000902344655001202353IND60651739620221119233657.0190712e20150930xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065173962DNAL7 a10.3390/su710134692doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Huimin10aMulti-Scale Measurement of Regional Inequality in Mainland China during 2005–2010 Using DMSP/OLS Night Light Imagery and Population Density Grid Data  ap. 13469-13499.  aJournal Article  aThis study used the Night Light Development Index (NLDI) to measure the regional inequality of public services in Mainland China at multiple scales. The NLDI was extracted based on a Gini Coefficient approach to measure the spatial differences of population distribution and night light distribution. Population data were derived from the dataset of China’s population density grid, and night light data were acquired from satellite imagery. In the multi-scale analysis, we calculated the NLDI for China as a whole, eight economic regions, 31 provincial regions, and 354 prefectural cities for the two years of 2005 and 2010. The results indicate that Southwest China and Northwest China are the regions with the most unequal public services, with NLDI values of 0.7116 and 0.7251 for 2005, respectively, and 0.6678 and 0.6304 for 2010, respectively. In contrast, Northern Coastal China had the lowest NLDI values of 0.4775 and 0.4312 for 2005 and 2010, respectively, indicating that this region had the most equal public services. Also, the regional inequality of Mainland China in terms of NLDI has been reduced from 0.6161 to 0.5743 during 2005–2010. The same pattern was observed from the provincial and prefectural analysis, suggesting that public services in Mainland China became more equal within the five-year period. A regression analysis indicated that provincial and prefectural regions with more public services per capita and higher population density had more equal public services.  aPublisher supplied data 3acities 3adata collection 3aeconomic regions 3apopulation density 3apopulation distribution 3apublic services and goods 3aregression analysis 3aremote sensing 3aChina1 aYang, Hutao1 aLi, Xi1 aJin, Huiran1 aLi, Deren0 tSustainability.g2015 Sept. 30, v. 7, no. 10 p.13469-13499dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2270x2071-10507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su710134693Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02109naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002400140245008800164300001800252500001900270520117400289592002801463650003601491650001801527650001901545700002101564700001701585773013401602856007401736852000901810655001201819IND60661458420221122033843.0190829e20140707xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066145842DNAL7 a10.1039/c4cs00104d2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPescitelli, Gennaro10aApplication of electronic circular dichroism in the study of supramolecular systems  ap. 5211-5233.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aChiral supramolecular architectures constitute crucial structural and functional elements in living systems and have been long mimicked by chemists to synthesize new artificial systems endowed with desired properties and functions. Among several techniques to study noncovalent chiral assemblies or aggregates, electronic circular dichroism (ECD) plays a key role because many mechanisms responsible for the appearance of ECD bands occur through space, and therefore are intrinsically sensitive to intermolecular interactions, from short to long-range. The aim of this tutorial review is to emphasize the different kinds of information which can be obtained specifically when chiral supramolecular species are characterized by means of ECD spectroscopy. We will survey several typical applications of ECD in the context of supramolecular chemistry, ranging from the simple detection of chiral aggregates or complexes, to the definition of stoichiometric ratios between the partners, the derivation of thermodynamic and kinetic parameters such as binding and rate constants, and ultimately to the refinement of the most plausible structure of the supramolecular species.  aPublisher supplied data 3acircular dichroism spectroscopy 3astoichiometry 3athermodynamics1 aDi Bari, Lorenzo1 aBerova, Nina0 tChemical Society reviews.g2014 July 7, v. 43, no. 15 p.5211-5233dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:20471x1460-47447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c4cs00104d3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02364naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245010400163300001600267520101300283592002801296650002101324650001601345650001101361650002401372650001501396650000901411650002001420650001801440650002401458650000901482650002001491650002501511650001701536651001201553653001801565653002001583653000901603653001201612653001201624773019101636856008201827852000901909655001201918IND60517655620221120071329.0190730e201312  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051765562DNAL7 a10.1017/S00439339130009372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYakubu, A.,10aCharacterisation of the local Muscovy duck in Nigeria and its potential for egg and meat production  ap. 931-938.  aResearch results and facts about indigenous Muscovy duck production in Nigeria are reviewed with the aim of assessing its current status and delivering relevant information to stakeholders and other potential beneficiaries. There are large variations in phenotypic and biochemical characteristics of indigenous Muscovy ducks in the country, which could serve as a basis for genetic improvement. These ducks have the potential for a mean live weight of 2.73 and 1.52 kg and dressing percentage of 71.2% and 69.8% for drakes and ducks, respectively. Under scavenging, backyard farming conditions, the ducks can lay between 60 and 80 eggs each per year, and about 100 and 125 eggs per bird per year with an egg weight of about 72g under improved management conditions. The morphological, meat and egg attributes of local Muscovy ducks may be exploited in management decisions geared towards ensuring an increase in productivity, thereby making an important contribution to food security in a developing economy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCairina moschata 3abody weight 3adrakes 3adressing percentage 3aegg weight 3aeggs 3afarming systems 3afood security 3agenetic improvement 3ameat 3ameat production 3aphenotypic variation 3astakeholders 3aNigeria 0aMuscovy ducks 0acharacteristics 0aeggs 0acarcass 0aNigeria0 tWorld's poultry science journal.g2013 Dec., v. 69, no. 4 p.931-938dCambridge University Press on behalf of World&#x0027;s Poultry Science AssociationwJournal:jnl45575x1743-47777nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S00439339130009373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02550naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245006900166300001800235520158800253592002801841650001201869650002101881650001301902650002601915650001101941651001401952700002101966700002201987700002802009773009702037856008102134852000902215655001202224IND60121705720221120222331.0150319e201504  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012170572DNAL7 a10.1007/s10530-014-0785-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBugnot, Ana B.10aCommunity-level impacts of the invasive isopod Cirolana harfordi  ap. 1149-1161.  aThe invasive isopod Cirolana harfordi occurs in great densities in oyster-beds in Sydney Harbour and is the second most abundant taxon in terms of biomass. A previous observational study did not find any relationships between densities of C. harfordi and variability in local assemblage structure; this result could, however, be confounded by the enormous variation in the composition of the assemblage between locations. Using manipulative experiments in mesocosms to standardise for such local contingencies, this study evaluated the impacts of this invasive species on assemblages in experimental oyster-beds. We deployed experimental oyster-beds among natural oyster-beds in locations within Hawkesbury River, Australia, where C. harfordi was absent, to be colonised by the assemblage of organisms for 2 months. C. harfordi were then introduced to these experimental oyster-beds in mesocosms. Assemblages in invaded experimental oyster-beds were compared to those in non-invaded experimental oyster-beds in mesocosms and in natural oyster-beds in Sydney Harbour. The results showed no change in the structure of assemblages where C. harfordi were introduced, and those assemblages were similar to those in natural oyster-beds, thus supporting the initial patterns observed in the field. The evidence did not support the general assumption that non-indigenous species with high biomass and abundance cause impacts on local assemblages. This quantitative assessment of the potential impact of C. harfordi provides valuable information for managers to decide on control strategies.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiomass 3ainvasive species 3amanagers 3aobservational studies 3arivers 3aAustralia1 aColeman, Ross A.1 aFigueira, Will F.1 aMarzinelli, Ezequiel M.0 tBiological invasions.g2015 Apr., v. 17, no. 4 p.1149-1161dSpringer-Verlagx1387-35477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10530-014-0785-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02757naa a2200853 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002300149245007100172300001400243520073000257592002800987650002801015650001701043650001701060650001701077650001201094650001401106653000901120653001101129653001401140653001301154653000601167653000601173653000601179653000901185653000601194653000901200653000901209653000901218653000701227653000701234653001101241653000701252653000901259653000901268653000801277653001101285653001101296653000901307653000801316653000701324653000801331653000901339653001001348653000801358653001201366653000801378653000901386653000901395653000801404653000901412653000901421653001001430653000901440653000801449653000801457653002301465653002701488653002701515653001501542653002801557653001701585653002801602700002301630700002101653773012501674856008301799852000901882655001201891IND60611902920221122123801.0180904e201709  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061190292DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cocis.2017.07.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNatfji, Az Alddien10aFeasibility of polymer-drug conjugates for non-cancer applications  ap. 51-66.  aPolymer-drug conjugates have been intensely studied in the context of improving cancer chemotherapy and yet the only polymer-drug conjugate on the market (Movantik®) has a different therapeutic application (relieving opioid-induced constipation).

As with many ornamental plants, the information on the etiology of peony diseases is incomplete with varying amounts of detailed descriptive material; sometimes validation of Koch’s postulates is also lacking. In a survey to identify the range of diseases of peony in the United States, samples were obtained from 12 states. Fungal and oomycete plant pathogens recovered from symptomatic, diseased tissue were identified by morphology and BLAST identification of the internal transcribed spacer, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase, the 28s large subunit, and/or cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 gene nucleotide sequences for representative isolates. Ten fungal or oomycete genera were identified, and Koch’s postulates were confirmed for selected plant pathogens found during this survey. New disease reports are generated for several states, including five genera never previously reported on peonies in the United States: a Botryosphaeria sp., multiple Colletotrichum spp., Mycocentrospora acerina, a Phoma sp., and Pilidium concavum. The information gained from this survey will provide plant disease diagnosticians and growers a more comprehensive resource for understanding the regional prevalence of peony diseases and subsequently making better disease management decisions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBotryosphaeria 3aColletotrichum 3aMycocentrospora acerina 3aOomycetes 3aPaeonia lactiflora 3aPhoma 3acut flowers 3acytochrome-c oxidase 3adisease control 3afungi 3agenes 3aglyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase 3agrowers 3ahybrids 3ainternal transcribed spacers 3alandscapes 3aornamental plants 3aplant pathogens 3asurveys 3aUnited States 0aornamentals 0aPilidium concavum1 aChastagner, Gary A.0 tPlant health progress.g2019 Nov. 11, v. 20, no. 4 p.250-254dThe American Phytopathological SocietywJournal:6160x1535-10257nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/PHP-09-19-0065-S3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02968naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001700145245012200162300001800284500002000302500001500322520162100337592002801958650001701986650001602003650001302019650002002032650001402052650001402066650001602080650001602096650003102112650001202143650001102155650001302166653001102179700002002190700002002210700001902230700006002249773012502309856007902434852000902513655001202522IND60608866320221117223451.0180813e201808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060886632DNAL7 a10.1111/1750-3841.142212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee, Sang Mi10aDetermination of Volatiles and Carotenoid Degradation Compounds in Red Pepper Fermented by Lactobacillus parabuchneri  ap. 2083-2091.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  a2019-12-06  aRed pepper (Capsicum annuum L.) has been used as one of key ingredients in certain fermented foods due to it providing a unique hot and spicy sensation. In this study, volatile compounds—including degradation compounds of carotenoids—in fermented red pepper inoculated with Lactobacillus parabuchneri were investigated. In total, the contents of certain alcohols, benzene and its derivatives, esters, hydrocarbons, lactones, pyrazines, and terpenes were increased in red pepper inoculated with L. parabuchneri, while those of aldehydes, sulfur‐containing compounds, and ketones decreased during the fermentation period. The contents of some degradation compounds of carotenoids (β‐ionone, β‐cyclocitral, α‐ionone, and β‐damascenone) increased significantly with the fermentation period. In particular, the content of β‐damascenone—which could form by the degradation of neoxanthin—increased gradually during fermentation, but this compound was not detected in 0‐day samples. These findings indicate that the contents of certain volatiles—including degradation compounds of carotenoids—in fermented red pepper inoculated with L. parabuchneri can change markedly during the fermentation process. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: This study investigated the changes of volatiles and carotenoids degradation compounds in fermented red pepper inoculated with Lactobacillus parabuchneri during fermentation. These results could be used to improve the quality of red pepper‐based products and in the development of certain fermented foods, including Gochujang (fermented red pepper paste) and kimchi.  aPublisher supplied data 3afermentation 3abeta-ionone 3alactones 3aCapsicum annuum 3apyrazines 3aaldehydes 3acarotenoids 3aingredients 3aLactobacillus parabuchneri 3abenzene 3akimchi 3aalcohols 0aesters1 aLee, Joo-Young,1 aCho, Youn Jeung1 aKim, Moon Seok1 aKim, Young‐Suk1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1343-56470 tJournal of food science.g2018 Aug., v. 83, no. 8 p.2083-2091dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl48587x0022-11477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1750-3841.142213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03139naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100001600166245011900182300001800301520118200319592002801501650001101529650001101540650001001551650002001561650001301581650002701594650001301621650001801634650001801652650001501670650001001685650007101695650002001766650006201786650001301848650001101861650001601872650002701888650002801915650005601943650001401999650001502013650005202028650002702080650005202107650002702159650001602186651001002202651002502212700001502237700001602252700001702268700001702285700001602302700001502318773009902333856004802432852000902480655001202489IND50070242820221117202559.0131029e201311  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007024282DNAL7 a237547432pmid7 a10.1007/s00705-013-1753-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSai, Lintao10aClinical and molecular epidemiology of norovirus infection in adults with acute gastroenteritis in Ji’nan, China  ap. 2315-2322.  aAcute gastroenteritis caused by human noroviruses (NoVs) has become an important public health problem worldwide. This study was carried out to investigate the rates of NoV infections and the genetic characteristics of NoVs in adult outpatients with acute gastroenteritis in Ji'nan, a large eastern city in China. A total of 480 fecal samples were collected from outpatients at the Shandong University Qilu Hospital between June 2010 and May 2011. Of the collected samples, 42 (42/480, 8.75 %) were positive for NoVs by RT-PCR, and seven different genotypes were identified: GI-1, GI-4, GII-1, GII-3, GII-4, GII-6 and GII-13, of which GII-4 was the most prevalent (29/42, 69.0 %). Phylogenetic and Simplot analyses showed that three recombinant strains were detected: two GII-4 polymerase/GII-3 capsid recombinants and one GII-6 polymerase/GII-4 capsid recombinant. This study indicated that NoV was a common causative agent of sporadic acute gastroenteritis in adults in Ji'nan, China, and that NoV GII-4 was the predominant strain during this period. Three recombinant strains were identified in which GII-6 polymerase/GII-4 capsid was detected for the first time in China.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadults 3acapsid 3afeces 3agastroenteritis 3agenotype 3amolecular epidemiology 3apatients 3apublic health 2aAcute Disease 2aAdolescent 2aAdult 2aCaliciviridae Infectionsxepidemiologyxphysiopathologyxvirology. 2aFecesxvirology 2aGastroenteritisxepidemiologyxphysiopathologyxvirology. 2aGenotype 2aHumans 2aMiddle Aged 2aMolecular Epidemiology 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aNorovirusxclassificationxgeneticsxpathogenicity. 2aPhylogeny 2aPrevalence 2aRNA, Viralxgeneticsxisolation & purification. 2aRecombination, Genetic 2aReverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 2aYoung Adult 3aChina 0aChinaxepidemiology.1 aWang, Gang1 aShao, Lihua1 aLiu, Haihong1 aZhang, Yajun1 aQu, Chunmei1 aMa, Lixian0 tArchives of virology.g2013 Nov., v. 158, no. 11 p.2315-2322dSpringer-Verlagx0304-86087nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00705-013-1753-0  aDNAL 7aarticle02388naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100006000147245010600207300001600313520108000329592002801409650002501437650002501462650001301487650002101500650001301521650002001534650001001554650000901564653002101573653002401594653001601618653001701634653001701651653001501668700002101683700002301704773013601727856008101863961001301944852000901957655001201966IND60680921220221120221239.0200110e20191217xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068092122DNAL7 a10.1094/PHP-09-19-0068-RS2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCopes, Warren E.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7360-750610aControl of Pseudomonas amygdali pv. loropetali on Metal, Wood, and Loropetalum chinense Stem Surfaces  ap. 270-277.  aClorox Germicidal Bleach, Cuproxat, Green-Shield II, KleenGrow, Virkon S, and ZeroTol 2.0 were evaluated for their ability to inactivate Pseudomonas amygdali pv. loropetali on stainless steel (SS), pressure-treated wood (PtW), and loropetalum stem sections.

Green-Shield II at 0.5% product and KleenGrow at 0.8% product nearly eliminated the bacterium on SS, while causing a significant reduction without elimination on PtW. Cuproxat and ZeroTol 2.0 were not effective against this bacterium in these applications. Clorox and KleenGrow were evaluated further for their ability to kill P. amygdali pv. loropetali on loropetalum stems, which was used as a preliminary surrogate for vegetative stem cuttings. Only Clorox eliminated bacteria from stem surfaces, but the bacterial inoculum level appeared to affect efficacy. Several disinfestants are commercially available that kill P. amygdali pv. loropetali on production surfaces.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLoropetalum chinense 3aPseudomonas amygdali 3abacteria 3ableaching agents 3ainoculum 3astainless steel 3astems 3awood 0achemical control 0ahorticultural crops 0aornamentals 0adisinfestant 0adisinfectant 0asanitation1 aMavrodi, Olga V.1 aMavrodi, Dmitri V.0 tPlant health progress.g2019 Dec. 17, v. 20, no. 4 p.270-277dThe American Phytopathological SocietywJournal:6160x1535-10257nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/PHP-09-19-0068-RS3Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle02663naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001900139245013700158300001800295500000900313520162700322592002801949650001401977650001301991650001402004650001002018650001002028650001102038650001802049650002202067650001302089650001602102773011302118856007302231852000902304655001202313IND60466721920221121020827.0151127e201512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6046672192DNAL7 a10.1111/mec.134442doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRyberg, Martin10aMolecular operational taxonomic units as approximations of species in the light of evolutionary models and empirical data from Fungi  ap. 5770-5777.  aNEWS  aDuring the last couple of decades, an increasing number of studies use sequence clusters as units for taxonomic diversity. It is well known that such molecular operational taxonomic units (MOTUs) do not necessarily correspond to species, but they are treated as such when measuring diversity and testing theories. Here, I show that data from studies of molecular evolution and species diversification of fungi indicate that commonly used cut‐offs are likely to lump species in many cases. At the same time, empirical studies show that the mean within‐species variation is close to these cut‐offs. That the within‐species variation estimates are plausible is supported by coalescence modelling under a range of parameter settings. In addition, studies using crossing tests to delimit species show that there often is an overlap in within‐ and between‐species distances. The available data therefore indicate that sequence clusters are likely to misrepresent species. However, to keep a biological relevance, MOTUs should be kept in close agreement with species. Studies using them should therefore asses how sensitive the results are to differences between MOTUs and species – something that is rarely done. An even better solution is to directly include the uncertainty in species delimitation in the analyses, but in many cases, we need to increase our knowledge of taxonomy and evolution to do this accurately. Even if the empirical data referred to here pertain to the “barcoding” region of rDNA in fungi, there is nothing indicating that the situation is substantially better for other taxa or genes.  aPublisher supplied data 3abarcoding 3acrossing 3aevolution 3afungi 3agenes 3amodels 3aribosomal DNA 3aspecies diversity 3ataxonomy 3auncertainty0 tMolecular ecology.g2015 Dec., v. 24, no. 23 p.5770-5777dBlackwell Scientific Publicationsx0962-10837nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/mec.134443Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03126naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245008700167300001400254520147600268592002801744650001901772650002701791650001901818650001601837650001301853650002001866650001401886650001701900650000901917650001101926650001101937650001601948650001501964650001801979650001401997650001602011651001802027651001902045653001502064653002702079653001902106653001902125653001202144700001302156700001902169700001302188700001702201700001702218700001602235700001702251773018902268856008202457852000902539655001202548IND60517655920221120061028.0190730e201403  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051765592DNAL7 a10.1017/S00439339140000262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTHRELFALL, E.J.10aEgg-borne infections of humans with salmonella: not only an S. enteritidis problem  ap. 15-26.  aThe principal salmonella serovar associated with infections linked to eggs and egg products in the UK, most European countries and North America is Salmonella enteritidis. However, other serovars have also been implicated in a number of egg-associated outbreaks, most notably S. typhimurium exhibiting a range of phage types. The present article reviews human egg-associated salmonellosis associated with non-S. enteritidis serovars, predominantly in the European Union (EU) but also world-wide, using information from published literature and epidemiological databases. There are also brief reviews of S. enteritidis and of mechanisms leading to egg contamination by salmonella. The numbers of egg-associated infections caused by non-S. enteritidis serovars are fairly substantial (for example 22% of outbreaks and 11.5% of more than 20,000 cases in the EU in 2008), and such infections have resulted in hospitalisations and deaths. Furthermore, in parts of the world where S. enteritidis historically has not penetrated laying hen breeding flocks, egg-related salmonellosis is a problem associated specifically with non-S. enteritidis serovars. Control measures to limit the incidence of S. enteritidis and S. typhimurium in poultry flocks are vital. It is therefore important that close surveillance of salmonellosis incidence and serovars in laying flocks is used to establish suitable biosecurity and vaccination programmes throughout EU Member States and elsewhere.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEuropean Union 3aSalmonella Enteritidis 3abacteriophages 3abiosecurity 3abreeding 3acontrol methods 3adatabases 3aegg products 3aeggs 3aflocks 3ahumans 3alaying hens 3amonitoring 3asalmonellosis 3aserotypes 3avaccination 3aNorth America 3aUnited Kingdom 0aSalmonella 0aegg-related infections 0aS. enteritidis 0aS. typhimurium 0acontrol1 aWAIN, J.1 aPeters, Thies,1 aLANE, C.1 aDE PINNA, E.1 aLITTLE, C.L.1 aWALES, A.D.1 aDAVIES, R.H.0 tWorld's poultry science journal.g2014 Mar., v. 70, no. 1 p.15-26dCambridge University Press on behalf of World&#x0027;s Poultry Science AssociationwJournal:jnl45575x1743-47777nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S00439339140000263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02328naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002200152245010000174300001600274520127300290592002801563650000801591650001901599650001601618650003101634650001801665650001501683650000901698650001401707650002001721650001601741700001701757700001701774773008001791856008601871852000901957655001201966IND60084980320221119164512.0141101e201302  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008498032DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apenergy.2012.05.0472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVan de Beld, Bert14aThe use of pyrolysis oil and pyrolysis oil derived fuels in diesel engines for CHP applications  ap. 190-197.  aThe objective of the work presented in this paper is to contribute to the development of CHP systems based on conventional diesel engines but fuelled with pyrolysis oil or pyrolysis oil derived fuels. Experiments have been carried out using a one-cylinder, 20kWₑ diesel engine, which was adapted to enable the feeding of different fuels and the monitoring of its performance. Apart from the introduction of a completely new stainless steel fuel injection system also specific measures have been implemented to overcome the difficult and slow ignition behavior of pyrolysis oil. Pyrolysis oil could be successfully combusted provided the air inlet temperature was increased to 100–120°C at an engine compression ratio of 17.6. This temperature can be reduced by approximately 40°C when the compression ratio is increased to 22.4. Generally, pyrolysis oil fuelling led to an increase in CO emission and a decrease in NOₓ emission. Apparently, peak temperatures in the cylinder are lower upon fuelling pyrolysis oil. A ‘duration’ experiment of 40h was carried out while fuelling pyrolysis oil, without any notable effect on flue gas emissions and fuel consumption. This is considered as a very promising result, but further long-term testing will be required.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3adiesel engines 3adiesel fuel 3aenergy use and consumption 3agas emissions 3amonitoring 3aoils 3apyrolysis 3astainless steel 3atemperature1 aHolle, Elmar1 aFlorijn, Jan0 tApplied energy.g2013 Feb., v. 102 p.190-197dElsevier Ltdx0306-26197nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2012.05.0473Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03030naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100006400139245008100203300001800284500001900302500002000321520158900341592002801930596006401958650002202022650001402044650001302058650001802071650001102089650001702100650000902117650002402126650002102150650001402171650002202185650001502207650002202222650002302244650001102267650001102278650001602289700002102305700001902326773012102345856007302466852000902539655001202548IND60710980920221122021101.0200915e202009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071098092DNAL7 a10.1111/mec.155552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZamora‐Terol, Sara1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7822-319710aReconstructing marine plankton food web interactions using DNA metabarcoding  ap. 3380-3395.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aKnowledge of zooplankton in situ diet is critical for accurate assessment of marine ecosystem function and structure, but due to methodological constraints, there is still a limited understanding of ecological networks in marine ecosystems. Here, we used DNA‐metabarcoding to study trophic interactions, with the aim to unveil the natural diet of zooplankton species under temporal variation of food resources. Several target consumers, including copepods and cladocerans, were investigated by sequencing 16S rRNA and 18S rRNA genes to identify prokaryote and eukaryote potential prey present in their guts. During the spring phytoplankton bloom, we found a dominance of diatom and dinoflagellate trophic links to copepods. During the summer period, zooplankton including cladocerans showed a more diverse diet dominated by cyanobacteria and heterotrophic prey. Our study suggests that copepods present trophic plasticity, changing their natural diet over seasons, and adapting their feeding strategies to the available prey spectrum, with some species being more selective. We did not find a large overlap of prey consumed by copepods and cladocerans, based on prey diversity found in their guts, suggesting that they occupy different roles in the trophic web. This study represents the first molecular approach to investigate several zooplankton–prey associations under seasonal variation, and highlights how, unlike other techniques, the diversity coverage is high when using DNA, allowing the possibility to detect a wide range of trophic interactions in plankton communities.  aPublisher supplied data  a2016‐04685cSwedish Research Council ‐ Vetenskapsrådet 3aBacillariophyceae 3aCladocera 3aCopepoda 3aDNA barcoding 3aMiozoa 3aalgal blooms 3adiet 3aecological function 3aeukaryotic cells 3afood webs 3amarine ecosystems 3aplasticity 3aprokaryotic cells 3aseasonal variation 3aspring 3asummer 3azooplankton1 aNovotny, Andreas1 aWinder, Monika0 tMolecular ecology.g2020 Sept., v. 29, no. 17 p.3380-3395dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl48811x0962-10837nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/mec.155553Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03158naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094024002200121024001900143040001800162100003300180245009700213300001800310500001500328506007600343520166700419592002802086506003702114650002502151650002702176650000902203650002502212650002002237650002402257650001602281650001102297650002202308650001902330650001502349650002202364650001402386653001002400700002202410700002402432700002502456773011302481856007302594852000902667655001202676IND60466722120221207093655.0151127e201512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6046672212DNAL7 a10.1111/mec.134372doi7 aPMC47373952pmcid7 a265097902pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGonzalez‐Quevedo, Catalina10aDrift, not selection, shapes toll‐like receptor variation among oceanic island populations  ap. 5852-5863.  a2019-12-06  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aUnderstanding the relative role of different evolutionary forces in shaping the level and distribution of functional genetic diversity among natural populations is a key issue in evolutionary and conservation biology. To do so accurately genetic data must be analysed in conjunction with an unambiguous understanding of the historical processes that have acted upon the populations. Here, we focused on diversity at toll‐like receptor (TLR) loci, which play a key role in the vertebrate innate immune system and, therefore, are expected to be under pathogen‐mediated selection. We assessed TLR variation within and among 13 island populations (grouped into three archipelagos) of Berthelot's pipit, Anthus berthelotii, for which detailed population history has previously been ascertained. We also compared the variation observed with that found in its widespread sister species, the tawny pipit, Anthus campestris. We found strong evidence for positive selection at specific codons in TLR1LA, TLR3 and TLR4. Despite this, we found that at the allele frequency level, demographic history has played the major role in shaping patterns of TLR variation in Berthelot's pipit. Levels of diversity and differentiation within and across archipelagos at all TLR loci corresponded very closely with neutral microsatellite variation and with the severity of the bottlenecks that occurred during colonization. Our study shows that despite the importance of TLRs in combating pathogens, demography can be the main driver of immune gene variation within and across populations, resulting in patterns of functional variation that can persist over evolutionary timescales.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aToll-like receptor 4 3amicrosatellite repeats 3aloci 3aToll-like receptor 3 3ainnate immunity 3awildlife management 3avertebrates 3acodons 3aAnthus campestris 3agene frequency 3ademography 3agenetic variation 3apathogens 0agenes1 aSpurgin, Lewis G.1 aIllera, Juan Carlos1 aRichardson, David S.0 tMolecular ecology.g2015 Dec., v. 24, no. 23 p.5852-5863dBlackwell Scientific Publicationsx0962-10837nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/mec.134373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03141naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100006100139245007600200300001800276500001900294500002000313520159800333592002801931596005301959596005802012596004302070596004202113650003502155650001502190650001402205650002102219650002202240650001002262650002002272650001802292650001202310650002002322650001402342650001402356700005702370700001902427700002202446773012102468856007302589852000902662655001202671IND60710981020221121221201.0200915e202009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071098102DNAL7 a10.1111/mec.154522doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMcDonald, Cait A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8291-608710aIncapacitating effects of fungal coinfection in a novel pathogen system  ap. 3173-3186.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aAs globalization lowers geographic barriers to movement, coinfection with novel and enzootic pathogens is increasingly likely. Novel and enzootic pathogens can interact synergistically or antagonistically, leading to increased or decreased disease severity. Here we examine host immune responses to coinfection with two closely related fungal pathogens: Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd) and Batrachochytrium salamandrivorans (Bsal). Both pathogens have had detrimental effects on amphibian populations, with Bd now largely enzootic, while Bsal is currently spreading and causing epizootics. Recent experimental work revealed that newts coinfected with Bd and Bsal had significantly higher mortality than those infected with either pathogen alone. Here we characterize host immunogenomic responses to chytrid coinfection relative to single infection. Across several classes of immune genes including pattern recognition receptors, cytokines, and MHC, coinfected host gene expression was weakly upregulated or comparable to that seen in single Bd infection, but significantly decreased when compared to Bsal infection. Combined with strong complement pathway downregulation and keratin upregulation, these results indicate that coinfection with Bd and Bsal compromises immune responses active against Bsal alone. As Bsal continues to invade naïve habitats where Bd is enzootic, coinfection will be increasingly common. If other Bd‐susceptible species in the region have similar responses, interactions between the two pathogens could cause severe population and community‐level declines.  aPublisher supplied data  cCornell Atkinson Center for a Sustainable Future  aDEB‐1523551cNSF Postdoctoral Fellowship in Biology  cCornell Center for Vertebrate Genomics  aD19ZO‐412cMorris Animal Foundation 3aBatrachochytrium dendrobatidis 3acomplement 3acytokines 3adisease severity 3aenzootic diseases 3afungi 3agene expression 3aglobalization 3akeratin 3amixed infection 3amortality 3apathogens1 aLongo, Ana V.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5112-12461 aLips, Karen R.1 aZamudio, Kelly R.0 tMolecular ecology.g2020 Sept., v. 29, no. 17 p.3173-3186dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl48811x0962-10837nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/mec.154523Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02572naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100003400147245013000181300001600311520122100327592002801548650002201576650001601598650002301614650001301637650001601650650002101666650001401687650001901701700002401720700003901744700002501783700003901808700002601847700003501873700002701908700002501935773011201960856008102072852000902153655001202162IND60124033120221122130816.0150421e201505  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012403312DNAL7 a10.1007/s11240-014-0700-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCorrêa, João Paulo Oliveira10aIn vitro photoautotrophic potential and ex vitro photosynthetic competence of Pfaffia glomerata (Spreng.) Pedersen accessions  ap. 289-300.  aThis study aimed to investigate whether the in vitro photoautotrophic potential and 20 hydroxyecdysone (20E) production of six Pfaffia glomerata accessions could be correlated to photosynthetic performance and biomass accumulation under ex vitro conditions in a greenhouse environment. Our results showed that P. glomerata accessions displayed varying photosynthetic rates that may have resulted in differential biomass accumulation both in vitro and ex vitro. Accessions A4, A13 and A43 showed the highest dry weight under in vitro photoautotrophic conditions, coinciding with the higher photosynthetic rates of the same accessions in greenhouse. They also showed the highest 20E mass per plant ex vitro. Production of 20E in vitro also varied among accessions, with the highest total mass achieved by accessions A4 and A43. In addition to having the potential for optimizing propagation by reducing the duration of the in vitro culture stage and lessening death rate during acclimatization, the use of these genotypes with higher in vitro photoautotrophic potential can guarantee highly productive plants ex vitro because the biomass accumulation pattern observed in vitro matched that under greenhouse conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPfaffia glomerata 3aacclimation 3abiomass production 3agenotype 3agreenhouses 3ain vitro culture 3amortality 3aphotosynthesis1 aVital, Camilo Elber1 aPinheiro, Marcos Vinícius Marques1 aBatista, Diego Silva1 aAzevedo, Jéssica Fernanda Laísca1 aSaldanha, Cleber Witt1 ada Cruz, Ana Cláudia Ferreira1 aDaMatta, Fábio Murilo1 aOtoni, Wagner Campos0 tPlant cell, tissue, and organ culture.g2015 May, v. 121, no. 2 p.289-300dSpringer-Verlagx0167-68577nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11240-014-0700-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03068naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245014500169300001600314520158900330592002801919650001901947650002001966650001501986650001802001650001002019650001502029650002302044650001602067650001902083650000902102650001302111650001802124650002302142650001002165653002102175653002702196653001902223653004302242653001802285700001902303700002302322700001702345700002602362773009602388856008102484852000902565655001202574IND60545041220221119150859.0160901e201412  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054504122DNAL7 a10.1016/j.rse.2014.09.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPulliainen, Jouni10aSemi-empirical modeling of the scene reflectance of snow-covered boreal forest: Validation with airborne spectrometer and LIDAR observations  ap. 303-311.  aThis work aims at the development and validation of a zeroth order radiative transfer (RT) approach to describe the visible band (555nm) reflectance of conifer-dominated boreal forest for the needs of remote sensing of snow. This is accomplished by applying airborne and mast-borne spectrometer data sets together with high-resolution information on forest canopy characteristics. In case of aerial spectrometer observations, tree characteristics determined from airborne LIDAR observations are applied to quantify the effect of forest canopy on scene reflectance. The results indicate that a simple RT model is feasible to describe extinction and reflectance properties of both homogeneous and heterogeneous forest scenes (corresponding to varying scales of satellite data footprints and varying structures of forest canopies). The obtained results also justify the application of apparent forest canopy transmissivity to describe the influence of forest to reflectance, as is done e.g. in the SCAmod method for the continental scale monitoring of fractional snow cover (FSC) from optical satellite data. Additionally, the feasibility of the zeroth order RT approach is compared with the use of linear mixing model of scene reflectance. Results suggest that the non-linear RT approach describes the scene reflectance of a snow-covered boreal forest more realistically than the linear mixing model (in case when shadows on tree crowns and surface are not modeled separately, which is a relevant suggestion when considering the use of models for large scale snow mapping applications).  aPublisher supplied data 3aboreal forests 3adata collection 3aextinction 3aforest canopy 3alidar 3amonitoring 3aradiative transfer 3areflectance 3aremote sensing 3asnow 3asnowpack 3aspectrometers 3astatistical models 3atrees 0aSnow reflectance 0aRemote sensing of snow 0aBoreal forests 0aSpace-borne observed scene reflectance 0aSeasonal snow1 aSalminen, Miia1 aHeinilä, Kirsikka1 aCohen, Juval1 aHannula, Henna-Reetta0 tRemote sensing of environment.g2014 Dec., v. 155 p.303-311dElsevier Inc.x0034-42577nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rse.2014.09.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03237naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001900145245012100164300002000285520142700305592002801732596011101760596007801871650001701949650002601966650001401992650001602006650001502022650001502037650001902052650002002071650003702091653003302128653001202161653001602173700005202189700005302241700001602294700005402310700005202364700006002416700006002476773014202536856008002678852000902758655001202767IND60783231520221118060841.0220719e20220708xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078323152DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.est.1c086912doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhou, Shenghua10aUnveiling the Growth of Polyamide Nanofilms at Water/Organic Free Interfaces: Toward Enhanced Water/Salt Selectivity  ap. 10279-10288.  aThe permeance and selectivity of a reverse osmosis (RO) membrane are governed by its ultrathin polyamide film, yet the growth of this critical film during interfacial polymerization (IP) has not been fully understood. This study investigates the evolution of a polyamide nanofilm at the aqueous/organic interface over time. Despite its thickness remaining largely constant (∼15 nm) for the IP reaction time ranging from 0.5 to 60 min, the density of the polyamide nanofilm increased from 1.25 to 1.36 g cm–³ due to the continued reaction between diffused m-phenylenediamine and dangling acyl chloride groups within the formed polyamide film. This continued growth of the polyamide nanofilm led to a simultaneous increase in its crosslinking degree (from 50.1 to 94.3%) and the healing of nanosized defects, resulting in a greatly enhanced rejection of 99.2% for NaCl without sacrificing water permeance. Using humic acid as a molecular probe for sealing membrane defects, the relative contributions of the increased crosslinking and reduced defects toward better membrane selectivity were resolved, which supports our conceptual model involving both enhanced size exclusion and healed defects. The fundamental insights into the growth mechanisms and the structure–property relationship of the polyamide nanofilm provide crucial guidance for the further development and optimization of high-performance RO membranes.  aPublisher supplied data  aSRFS2021-7S04cResearch Grants Council, University Grants Committeedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100002920  a104006008cUniversity of Hong Kongdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100003803 3acrosslinking 3aenvironmental science 3aevolution 3ahumic acids 3ananosheets 3apolyamides 3apolymerization 3areverse osmosis 3astructure-activity relationships 0agrowth of polyamide nanofilm 0adefects 0aselectivity1 aLong, Li1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7951-32761 aYang, Zhe1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0753-39021 aSo, Sik Lui1 aGan, Bowen1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5496-56631 aGuo, Hao1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0688-54311 aFeng, Shien-Ping1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3941-13631 aTang, Chuyang Y.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7932-64620 tEnvironmental science & technology.g2022 July 08, v. 56, no. 14 p.10279-10288dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23339x1520-58517nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.1c086913Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01362naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002200139245010700161300001800268500000900286520050500295592002800800650001200828650001400840650001100854700002400865773011300889856007301002852000901075655001201084IND60466722320221122002124.0151127e201512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6046672232DNAL7 a10.1111/mec.134432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTibayrenc, Michel10aReproductive clonality in protozoan pathogens—truth or artifact?

Thus, developing decontamination strategies to eliminate or reduce this pathogen in chicken is crucial. The objective of the current study was to investigate the antimicrobial activity of malic acid (MA) and acetic acid (AA) or their combination against Salmonella on chicken breast at 4 °C for 10 days. The effect of storage temperature (4 and 21 °C) on Salmonella inactivation was also investigated for up to 21 days. Five serovars of Salmonella were inoculated in a model Mueller‐Hinton (MH) broth system to a level of about 7 log₁₀ CFU/mL and the broth was treated with 5 mg/mL of each of MA, AA or their combination. AA was more effective than MA in the model system at 21 °C, where it resulted in total elimination of Salmonella, but MA was more effective in eliminating Salmonella at 4 °C. However, the combined MA and AA solutions were more effective than either MA or AA alone. When applying washing solutions containing 5 mg/mL of either of MA, AA, or their combination to chicken breast inoculated with about 5 log₁₀ CFU/g, the MA+AA washing solution was the most effective. It resulted in complete elimination of Salmonella from chicken breast and rendered a significant reduction in mesophilic aerobic bacteria and lactic acid bacteria numbers. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: This study indicates that the use of a washing solution containing MA and AA could improve the safety and extend the shelf life of raw chicken by substantially reducing Salmonella and contaminating microflora on the product.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSalmonella 3aacetic acid 3aaerobes 3aantimicrobial properties 3abreast meat 3achicken meat 3adecontamination 3alactic acid bacteria 3amalic acid 3amodels 3apathogens 3araw chicken meat 3aserotypes 3ashelf life 3awashing1 aAl‐Holy, Murad A.1 aAbu Ghoush, Mahmoud H.1 aAl‐Nabulsi, Anas A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9592-055X1 aQatatsheh, Ala A.1 aShahbaz, Hafiz M.1 aOsaili, Tareq M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6166-13881 aHolley, Richard A.0 tJournal of food science.g2018 Aug., v. 83, no. 8 p.2197-2203dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl48587x0022-11477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1750-3841.142863Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02281naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002600147245010400173300001400277520094600291592002801237650002101265650001601286650001801302650000901320650002001329650001901349650002001368650001201388650001601400650001301416650001601429653001601445653001201461653001701473653001401490653001901504653002101523700002301544773018901567856008201756852000901838655001201847IND60517656420221120071312.0190730e201403  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051765642DNAL7 a10.1017/S00439339140000752doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aARCZEWSKA-WŁOSEK, A.10aNutrition as a modulatory factor of the efficacy of live anticoccidial vaccines in broiler chickens  ap. 81-92.  aThere has been growing interest in the development of natural methods of coccidiosis prophylaxis. Vaccination against coccidiosis with live oocysts is regarded as effective in the control of avian coccidiosis, but in some conditions, such as poor sanitary management or incorrect application of the vaccine, may lead to poorer performance, measured as reduced weight gain and feed efficiency, in comparison with prophylactically medicated birds. Such reports are the reason for widespread reluctance to use anticoccidial vaccine in broilers. This paper reviews broiler studies in which nutritional methods as performance and/or immune-supporting factor with regard to anticoccidial vaccination were investigated. The results of some of the studies presented in the article indicate that feed additives with immunostimulating properties, along with proper protein levels in the diet, may have a beneficial effect in cocci-vaccinated broilers.  aPublisher supplied data 3abroiler chickens 3acoccidiosis 3acoccidiostats 3adiet 3adisease control 3afeed additives 3afeed conversion 3aoocysts 3avaccination 3avaccines 3aweight gain 0acoccidiosis 0aEimeria 0alive vaccine 0anutrition 0afeed additives 0abroiler chickens1 aŚWIĄTKIEWICZ, S.0 tWorld's poultry science journal.g2014 Mar., v. 70, no. 1 p.81-92dCambridge University Press on behalf of World&#x0027;s Poultry Science AssociationwJournal:jnl45575x1743-47777nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S00439339140000753Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03872naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100006400140245012400204300001600328500002000344520187800364592002802242596005302270650002202323650002502345650001402370650001602384650001602400650001402416650003302430650002002463650001902483650002502502650002302527650002402550650001002574650002002584650001302604650001302617650002102630650002402651650004302675650002802718650001602746650001602762650001102778650001702789650001702806700005702823700006602880700005702946700006003003773013503063856007503198852000903273655001203282IND60775717820221121211642.0220427e202204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077571782DNAL7 a10.1002/ame2.122172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNazar‐Zadeh, Mahsa1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5002-434810aRoyal‐jelly‐based apitherapy can attenuate damages to male reproductive parameter following nicotine administration  ap. 133-140.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aBACKGROUND: Nicotine administration can generate severe oxidative stress and lipid peroxidation.

METHODS: Forty‐eight male BALB/c mice were divided into 8 groups (n = 6): saline, 3 different doses of royal jelly (100, 150, and 200 mg/kg body weight (BW) per day), nicotine (1.5 mg/kg), and 3 different groups of Nic + Roy (1.5 mg/kg of Nic + 100, 150, and 200 mg/kg BW per day of royal jelly). Nicotine was administrated intraperitoneally, and royal jelly was prescribed orally for 10 consecutive days. Serum levels of hormones (testosterone, luteinizing hormone, and follicle‐stimulating hormone), total antioxidant capacity, nitric oxide (NO) status, malondialdehyde levels, sperm DNA fragmentation, sperm parameters, histopathological changes (H&E staining), immunohistochemistry against apoptotic proteins, and gene expression of Bcl‐2, p53, Caspase‐3, and Nrf2 (real‐time PCR) were assessed to evaluate the molecular and histological changes. RESULTS: Hormone levels, sperm parameters, and status of antioxidants were decreased significantly (p < .05) following nicotine administration. Moreover, royal jelly treatment normalized hormonal and antioxidant characteristics, decreased apoptotic gene expression, increased Nfr2 gene expression, and restored histopathological alteration to the physiological status significantly (p < .05). CONCLUSION: Royal jelly upregulates the antioxidant status, inhibits the mitochondrial‐dependent apoptosis pathway, and increases the rate of proliferation. This therapeutic agent effectively protected the testis against nicotine‐associated damages by antioxidant and anti‐apoptotic effects.  aPublisher supplied data  a96067cKermanshah University of Medical Sciences 3aDNA fragmentation 3aantioxidant activity 3aapoptosis 3ablood serum 3abody weight 3acaspase-3 3afollicle-stimulating hormone 3agene expression 3ahistopathology 3aimmunohistochemistry 3alipid peroxidation 3aluteinizing hormone 3amales 3amalondialdehyde 3amedicine 3anicotine 3aoxidative stress 3aphysiological state 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3areactive oxygen species 3aroyal jelly 3aspermatozoa 3atestes 3atestosterone 3atherapeutics1 aJalili, Cyrus1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5097-79741 aNikgoftar Fathi, Amene1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4740-063X1 aGhanbari, Ali1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8080-28091 aBakhtiari, Mitra1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0871-90120 tAnimal models and experimental medicine.g2022 Apr., v. 5, no. 2 p.133-140dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:28349x2576-20957nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ame2.122173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03226naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002000139245013700159300001800296520180100314592002802115650001202143650001402155650001302169650004202182650001802224650000902242650002702251650002202278650002502300650001402325651001102339700002302350700002102373700002102394700001902415700001902434700001902453700002002472700002202492700002202514700002502536773011302561856007302674852000902747655001202756IND60466722420221122014809.0151127e201512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6046672242DNAL7 a10.1111/mec.134252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKuo, Hao‐Chih10aSpeciation processes in putative island endemic sister bat species: false impressions from mitochondrial DNA and microsatellite data  ap. 5910-5926.  aCases of geographically restricted co‐occurring sister taxa are rare and may point to potential divergence with gene flow. The two bat species Murina gracilis and Murina recondita are both endemic to Taiwan and are putative sister species. To test for nonallopatric divergence and gene flow in these taxa, we generated sequences using Sanger and next‐generation sequencing, and combined these with microsatellite data for coalescent‐based analyses. MtDNA phylogenies supported the reciprocally monophyletic sister relationship between M. gracilis and M. recondita; however, clustering of microsatellite genotypes revealed several cases of species admixture suggesting possible introgression. Sequencing of microsatellite flanking regions revealed that admixture signatures stemmed from microsatellite allele homoplasy rather than recent introgressive hybridization, and also uncovered an unexpected sister relationship between M. recondita and the continental species Murina eleryi, to the exclusion of M. gracilis. To dissect the basis of these conflicts between ncDNA and mtDNA, we analysed sequences from 10 anonymous ncDNA loci with *beast and isolation‐with‐migration and found two distinct clades of M. eleryi, one of which was sister to M. recondita. We conclude that Taiwan was colonized by the ancestor of M. gracilis first, followed by the ancestor of M. recondita after a period of allopatric divergence. After colonization, the mitochondrial genome of M. recondita was replaced by that of the resident M. gracilis. This study illustrates how apparent signatures of sympatric divergence can arise from complex histories of allopatric divergence, colonization and hybridization, thus highlighting the need for rigorous analyses to distinguish between such scenarios.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalleles 3agene flow 3agenotype 3ahigh-throughput nucleotide sequencing 3aintrogression 3aloci 3amicrosatellite repeats 3amitochondrial DNA 3amitochondrial genome 3amonophyly 3aTaiwan1 aChen, Shiang‐Fan1 aFang, Yin‐Ping1 aCotton, James A.1 aParker, Joe D.1 aCsorba, Gabor,1 aLim, Burton K.1 aEger, Judith L.1 aChen, Chia‐Hong1 aChou, Cheng‐Han1 aRossiter, Stephen J.0 tMolecular ecology.g2015 Dec., v. 24, no. 23 p.5910-5926dBlackwell Scientific Publicationsx0962-10837nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/mec.134253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03216naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001800155245015400173300001400327520158600341592002801927650002101955650003101976650001502007650001202022650001602034650001902050650001702069650001002086650002502096650001202121650002002133650002402153650002902177650001102206653001502217653002702232653003802259653003102297653002602328653001102354700001502365700001702380700002002397700001602417700001502433700001202448773012702460856009002587852000902677655001202686IND60541115620221122130858.0190318e20140502xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054111562DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijfoodmicro.2014.02.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aThevenard, B.10aResponse of S. thermophilus LMD-9 to bacitracin: Involvement of a BceRS/AB-like module and of the rhamnose–glucose polysaccharide synthesis pathway  ap. 89-97.  aStreptococcus thermophilus is a lactic acid bacterium of major importance to the dairy industry as it is found in numerous cheeses and is one of the two bacterial species involved in the fermentation of yogurt. Bacterial two-component signal transduction systems (TCSs) play important roles in the process of bacterial environmental adaptation. S. thermophilus LMD-9 possesses eight such TCS systems; however, their functions have thus far been only poorly investigated. Here, we focused on two of the TCSs in LMD-9, TCS06 and TCS07, whose encoding genes are located close to each other on the chromosome, and are associated with those of ABC transporters. TCS06 homologs are frequently found in Lactobacillales, but their function has not yet been determined, while TCS07 and its upstream potential ABC transporter are homologous to the BceRS/AB system, which is involved in bacitracin resistance in Bacillus and Streptococcus species. To investigate the function(s) of TCS06 and TCS07, we constructed and characterized deletion mutants and performed transcriptional analysis in the presence and absence of bacitracin. We show here that both TCS06 and TCS07 regulate the genes in their close vicinity, in particular those encoding ABC transporters. We propose that the response of S. thermophilus to bacitracin includes i) a bacitracin export system, regulated by TCS07 and constituting a BceRS/AB-like detoxification module, and ii) the modification of cell-envelope properties via modulation of rhamnose–glucose polysaccharide synthesis, at least partially regulated by TCS06.  aPublisher supplied data 3aABC transporters 3aStreptococcus thermophilus 3abacitracin 3acheeses 3achromosomes 3adairy industry 3afermentation 3agenes 3alactic acid bacteria 3amutants 3apolysaccharides 3asignal transduction 3atranscription (genetics) 3ayogurt 0aAntibiotic 0aDetoxification modules 0aRhamnose–glucose polysaccharide 0aStreptococcus thermophilus 0aTwo-component systems 0aYogurt1 aBesset, C.1 aChoinard, S.1 aFourcassié, P.1 aBoyaval, P.1 aMonnet, V.1 aRul, F.0 tInternational journal of food microbiology.g2014 May 02, v. 177 p.89-97dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl35565x0168-16057nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijfoodmicro.2014.02.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02431naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245012100167300001800288500001500306520097600321592002801297650001301325650001801338650001401356650002201370650001301392650002601405650001201431653002301443700005301466700001701519700001701536700002001553700005001573700005601623700006301679700005501742773011901797856008401916852000902000655001202009IND60631503120221122133541.0190226e20190204xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063150312DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.macromol.8b026412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYuan, Zhenyu10aRedox-Controlled Voltage Responsive Micelles Assembled by Noncovalently Grafted Polymers for Controlled Drug Release  ap. 1400-1407.  a2019-12-06  aVoltage responsive micelles prepared from noncovalently grafted amphiphilic polymers were reported. The noncovalent amphiphilic polymers were prepared through the host–guest interaction between β-cyclodextrin (β-CD) grafted dextran (Dex-CD) and ferrocene (Fc) terminated poly(ε-caprolactone) (PCL-Fc). Because of the presence of Fc groups, the inclusion complex between Fc and β-CD can be reversibly controlled by an external stimulating voltage, leading to reversible formation and disassembly of the micelles. The occurrence of the inclusion complex between Fc and β-CD was confirmed by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and the 2D NOESY spectrum. Furthermore, meloxicam was selected as a model drug to test the controlled release performance of these voltage responsive micelles. It was found that the release rate and the final cumulative release amount of meloxicam can be effectively controlled by the external voltage, which may be of use in controlled drug delivery.  aPublisher supplied data 3amicelles 3aillicit drugs 3ameloxicam 3abeta-cyclodextrin 3apolymers 3adrug delivery systems 3adextran 0aelectric potential1 aWang, Jie1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2227-19711 aWang, Yiming1 aZhong, Yujie1 aZhang, Xinsheng1 aLi, Li1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5100-734X1 aWang, Junyou1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4693-850X1 aLincoln, Stephen F.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0329-19961 aGuo, Xuhong1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1792-85640 tMacromolecules.g2019 Feb. 04, v. 52, no. 4 p.1400-1407dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23616x1520-58357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.macromol.8b026413Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02425naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245006900167300001600236520101500252592002801267650002001295650001101315650001901326650001501345650001901360650001501379650001701394650002901411650001501440651001101455653002101466653001801487653002801505653003101533653002701564653001301591653001501604653001901619653002501638700002601663700001901689700001801708700001901726773009601745856008101841852000901922655001201931IND60545041420221119150713.0160901e201412  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054504142DNAL7 a10.1016/j.rse.2014.08.0362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRahlf, Johannes10aComparison of four types of 3D data for timber volume estimation  ap. 325-333.  aThe study compares the accuracy of timber volume prediction based on four different three-dimensional remote sensing data sets in one study area in southern Norway: airborne laser scanning (ALS), stereo aerial photogrammetry (AP), satellite interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) based on the TanDEM-X mission, and satellite radargrammetry based on the TerraSAR-X mission.

The cross-validated root mean squared error (RMSE) relative to the observed mean was used as the measure of goodness-of-fit. ALS provided the most accurate prediction at plot level with RMSE=19%, followed by AP (31%), InSAR (42%), and radargrammetry (44%). At stand level the methods' performances were equally ordered, with RMSE values of 12–23%.

TMV has been classified as a seedborne virus in tobacco, with infection of developing seedlings thought to occur from contact with the TMV-infected seed coat. The mechanism of TMV transmission through seed was studied in seed of the K 326 cultivar of flue-cured tobacco. Cross pollinations were performed to determine the effect of parental tissue on TMV infection in seed. Dissection of individual tobacco seeds into seed coat, endosperm, and embryo was performed to determine TMV location within a seed, while germination tests and separation of the developing seedling into seed coat, roots, and cotyledons were conducted to estimate the percent transmission of TMV. A reverse-transcriptase quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) assay was developed and used to determine TMV concentrations in individual seed harvested from pods that formed on plants from TMV-infected and noninfected crosses. The results showed maternal transmission of TMV to tobacco seed and seedlings that developed from infected seed, not paternal transmission. RT-qPCR and endpoint PCR assays were also conducted on the separated seed coat, endosperm, and embryo of individual seed and separated cotyledons, roots, and seed coats of individual seedlings that developed from infected tobacco seed to identify the location of the virus in the seed and the subsequent path the virus takes to infect the developing seedling. RT-qPCR and endpoint PCR assay results showed evidence of TMV infection in the endosperm and embryo, as well as in the developing seedling roots and cotyledons within 10 days of initiating seed germination. To our knowledge, this is the first report of TMV being detected in embryos of tobacco seed, demonstrating that TMV is seedborne and seed-transmitted in flue-cured tobacco.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNicotiana tabacum 3aRNA-directed DNA polymerase 3aTobacco mosaic virus 3acotyledons 3acrops 3acultivars 3aendosperm 3aflue-cured tobacco 3aplant diseases and disorders 3aplant viruses 3apods 3apollination 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3aroots 3aseed coat 3aseed germination 3aseedlings 3aviruses 0aRT-qPCR 0aseedborne transmission 0aseed transmission 0avirology1 aHoak, Jessica M.1 aEllis, Bradley W.1 aBrown, Jessica A.1 aSit, Tim L.1 aWilkinson, Carol A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7998-35771 aReed, T.

Published research has indicated that the significantly lower levels of organic minerals had a positive influence on the production performance of meat poultry and improved the production performance of laying hens and their heavy line hybrid parents. This has major impacts not only in terms of more efficient utilisation of chelated minerals in poultry diets, but also for less excretion of unused inorganic minerals into the environment, which is a major problem in many countries.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal nutrition 3abroiler chickens 3acholesterol 3adiet 3aexcretion 3ahybrids 3alaying hens 3alaying performance 3aminerals 3aparents 3apoultry meat 3atissues 0achelates 0apoultry 0achickens 0anutrition 0acholesterol1 aMilošević, N.,1 aSTANAĆEV, V.Ž.1 aPUVAČA, N.1 aMILIĆ, D.1 aPAVLOVSKI, Z.0 tWorld's poultry science journal.g2014 Mar., v. 70, no. 1 p.105-112dCambridge University Press on behalf of World&#x0027;s Poultry Science AssociationwJournal:jnl45575x1743-47777nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S00439339140000993Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02696naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245011800168300001600286500001500302520124500317592002801562650001201590650001701602650001601619650004101635650001801676650001401694650001701708650001401725650001301739650003001752650001901782650002201801650003101823650001001854650001201864650001601876650001901892653001301911700002001924700002001944700002001964700001601984773011202000856008102112852000902193655001202202IND60124033420221120073808.0150421e201505  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012403342DNAL7 a10.1007/s11240-014-0703-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aParray, Javid A.10aInteraction of rhizobacterial strains for growth improvement of Crocus sativus L. under tissue culture conditions  ap. 325-334.  a2019-12-04  aThe co-cultivation of tissue explants with beneficial microbes induces numerous developmental and metabolic alterations in the resulting plantlets conferring enhanced tolerance to abiotic and biotic stresses. In the present study we have co-cultivated plant growth promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) exhibiting multiple plant growth promoting activities with the in vitro raised saffron cormlets for evaluating various morphogenetic responses like proliferation, germination and weight increment of cormlets. The results obtained indicate the significant effect of Pseudomonas sp., Bacillus subtilis and Pantoea sp. in weight increment of cormlets. Proliferation of cormlets was also significantly improved with Pantoea sp. + Bacillus subtilus + Pseudomonas sp. on MS liquid medium. Similarly, the co-cultivation with Acinetobacter haemolyticus, Accintobacter lwoffii and Pantoea sp. resulted in 100 % germination of cormlets. The root system of cormlets was found denser and thicker than the control cormlets. However, rhizobacterial cormlets exhibited lower values of root length than non-treated cormlets. This study represents earliest report across the globe with suitable and reproducible protocol for corm development through PGPRs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPantoea 3aplant growth 3agermination 3aplant growth-promoting rhizobacteria 3abiotic stress 3aplantlets 3aroot systems 3acoculture 3aexplants 3abeneficial microorganisms 3aCrocus sativus 3aBacillus subtilis 3aAcinetobacter haemolyticus 3acorms 3asaffron 3aPseudomonas 3atissue culture 0aBacillus1 aKamili, Azra N.1 aReshi, Zafar A.1 aQadri, Raies A.1 aJan, Sumira0 tPlant cell, tissue, and organ culture.g2015 May, v. 121, no. 2 p.325-334dSpringer-Verlagx0167-68577nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11240-014-0703-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01455naa a2200277 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003600092040001800128100002600146245006100172300001600233520059600249592002800845650000900873650001300882650002100895650001300916650001800929700001700947773011000964852000901074856008201083655001201165IND8803080920221120164438.0181024e198804  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND880308092DNAL7 a10.1177/0040517588058004062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFleischfresser, B.

More extensive sorption was observed from neutral than from either basic or acidic solvents. These results may be rationalized in terms of acid-base interactions between solvent, wool, and carboxylic acids. Basic solvents inhibit sorption by competing with the wool for the acids, whereas acidic solvents inhibit sorption by competing with the carboxylic acids for the wool. Water, an amphoteric solvent, gives limited sorption of acids compared with that found from neutral solvents.  aPublisher supplied data 3awool 3asorption 3acarboxylic acids 3asolvents 3awool industry1 aSmith, G.

Chemical composition of CPS and reference pigments (calcium phosphates (CP) and calcium silicates (CS)) was investigated in relation to molar ratio of substrates and pH value of reaction medium. Steel corrosion inhibition efficiency (η) for the pigments was evaluated using electrochemical noise (EN), polarization resistance (POL) and Tafel (TAF) techniques. XRD and FT-IR data indicated that CPS are mixtures of the relevant CP and CS pigments. The EN, POL and TAF data revealed a sinusoidal relation between η and P:Si molar ratio in the substrates (at pH = 8.5 or 11). The best anticorrosive features were observed for CPS prepared at Si molar excess (pH = 8.5) (ηEN = 99%, ηPOL = 73% and ηTAF = 85%). Probably, the synergistic effect was resulted by a specific content and molar ratio of Ca, P₂O₅ and Si in the CPS-based electrolytes.  aPublisher supplied data 3acalcium 3acalcium phosphates 3acalcium silicate 3achemical composition 3acoprecipitation 3acorrosion 3aelectrochemistry 3apH 3apowders 3asteel 3asynergism 3atechnology 0aCo-precipitation 0aPhosphate pigment 0aCalcium phosphate 0aCa-exchange silica 0aZn-free phosphates, 0aElectrochemical method1 aKowalczyk, Krzysztof1 aGrzmil, Barbara0 tPowder technology.g2020 Aug., v. 373 p.660-670dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11732x0032-59107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.powtec.2020.07.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02892naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094024002200128024001900150040001800169100002000187245013600207300001800343506007600361520143300437592002801870506003701898650000801935650001501943650002201958650002701980650001202007650002302019650001602042650001502058650001102073650002102084650002302105650001202128650001402140700002102154700002402175700002402199773012002223856008202343852000902425655001202434IND60565665820221207050955.0170325e20170309xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056566582DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcb.6b119762doi7 aPMC53469692pmcid7 a281350922pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLakhani, Bharat10aEvolutionary Covariance Combined with Molecular Dynamics Predicts a Framework for Allostery in the MutS DNA Mismatch Repair Protein  ap. 2049-2061.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aMismatch repair (MMR) is an essential, evolutionarily conserved pathway that maintains genome stability by correcting base-pairing errors in DNA. Here we examine the sequence and structure of MutS MMR protein to decipher the amino acid framework underlying its two key activitiesrecognizing mismatches in DNA and using ATP to initiate repair. Statistical coupling analysis (SCA) identified a network (sector) of coevolved amino acids in the MutS protein family. The potential functional significance of this SCA sector was assessed by performing molecular dynamics (MD) simulations for alanine mutants of the top 5% of 160 residues in the distribution, and control nonsector residues. The effects on three independent metrics were monitored: (i) MutS domain conformational dynamics, (ii) hydrogen bonding between MutS and DNA/ATP, and (iii) relative ATP binding free energy. Each measure revealed that sector residues contribute more substantively to MutS structure–function than nonsector residues. Notably, sector mutations disrupted MutS contacts with DNA and/or ATP from a distance via contiguous pathways and correlated motions, supporting the idea that SCA can identify amino acid networks underlying allosteric communication. The combined SCA/MD approach yielded novel, experimentally testable hypotheses for unknown roles of many residues distributed across MutS, including some implicated in Lynch cancer syndrome.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDNA 3aDNA repair 3aGibbs free energy 3aadenosine triphosphate 3aalanine 3abase pair mismatch 3acoevolution 3acovariance 3agenome 3ahydrogen bonding 3amolecular dynamics 3amutants 3aneoplasms1 aThayer, Kelly M.1 aHingorani, Manju M.1 aBeveridge, David L.0 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2017 Mar. 09, v. 121, no. 9 p.2049-2061dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-52077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.jpcb.6b119763Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02351naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002500150245015300175300001600328520091900344592002801263650002701291650002001318650001101338650001901349650002401368650001301392650002301405650001001428650001301438650001601451650001901467650002001486650001001506653001401516653001301530653001401543653001601557653001601573653001001589700002001599700002301619700002401642773011001666856008401776852000901860655001201869IND60121880820221117233449.0150325e20140512xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012188082DNAL7 a10.1080/01904167.2013.8734622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCordovilla, M.

After transplanting, two-month-old plants received nutrient solutions supplemented with 0, 50, and 100 mM sodium chloride (NaCl) for 21 d. Thyme and lavender grown alone were each more tolerant to salt stress than thyme and lavender grown together. In the 100 mM NaCl treatment, all lavender plants grown with thyme died. In thyme, the carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) contents of the roots increased. Ethylene production in thyme was stimulated by salinity only in plants that interacted with lavender. However, in lavender, ethylene production was not influenced by the presence of thyme. The production of essential oils (EOs) was increased by salinity in thyme plants, whereas the EO production of lavender plants depended on the presence of thyme.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLavandula angustifolia 3aThymus vulgaris 3acarbon 3aessential oils 3aethylene production 3anitrogen 3anutrient solutions 3aroots 3asalinity 3asalt stress 3asalt tolerance 3asodium chloride 3athyme 0aC content 0alavender 0aN content 0ainteraction 0asalt stress 0athyme1 aBueno, Milagros1 aAparicio, Carolina1 aUrrestarazu, Miguel0 tJournal of plant nutrition.g2014 May 12, v. 37, no. 6 p.875-888dTaylor & Francis Groupx1532-40877nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01904167.2013.8734623Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01162naa a2200253 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003600092040001800128100001700146245007200163300001600235520036100251592002800612650000900640650001700649650001300666650001600679773011000695852000900805856008200814655001200896IND8803080620221120164641.0181024e198804  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND880308062DNAL7 a10.1177/0040517588058004022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWalls, G.

The effects of four magnesium levels [0, 0.5, 1, and 22 millliMolar (mM) magnesium as magnesium sulfate (MgSO ₄.5H ₂O)], and three salinity levels [0, 45 and 90 mM sodium chloride (NaCl)] on growth and the chemical composition of pistachio seedlings (Pistacia vera L.) cv. ‘Badami-e-Zarand’ was studied in sand culture under greenhouse conditions. The experiment was set up as a completely randomized design (CRD) with four replications. After 28 weeks the growth parameters of biomass, leaf number, leaf area and stem height were measured. The results demonstrated that salinity decreased biomass, leaf area and stem height; the application of 2 mM magnesium (Mg) significantly reduced biomass, leaf number, leaf area and stem height; salinity stress increased concentrations of sodium (Na) and potassium (K) in shoot as well as Na concentration in root; however, it decreased Mg and calcium (Ca) concentrations in shoot, as well as Mg, Ca, and K concentrations in root. The application of 2 mM Mg reduced K and Ca concentrations in shoot and Na and K concentrations in root.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPistacia vera 3abiomass 3acalcium 3achemical composition 3acrop production 3agreenhouses 3airrigated farming 3aleaf area 3aleaves 3amagnesium 3amagnesium sulfate 3apistachios 3apotassium 3asalinity 3asalt stress 3asand 3aseedlings 3asemiarid zones 3ashoots 3asodium 3asodium chloride 3asoil salinization 0aleaf number 0astem height 0anutrient 0apotassium1 aMozafari, V.1 aTajabadipour, A.1 aHokmabadi, H.0 tJournal of plant nutrition.g2014 May 12, v. 37, no. 6 p.889-906dTaylor & Francis Groupx1532-40877nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01904167.2013.8734633Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03178naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100005800153245012300211300002000334500001900354520172400373592002802097650001602125650001602141650001102157650002102168650001202189650004402201650000902245650001402254650001502268650001602283650001902299650003202318700006202350700001902412700002202431700002102453700002102474700001802495773012302513856008702636852000902723655001202732IND60713672620210419000000.0201023e20200915xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071367262DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.energyfuels.0c024532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYalaoui, Imane1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5392-187210aProbing Multiscale Structure and Dynamics of Waxy Crude Oil by Low-Field NMR, X-ray Scattering, and Optical Microscopy  ap. 12429-12439.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aWax deposition is one of the major concerns for waxy crude oil production and transportation. A better understanding and prediction of fluid properties related to this issue require knowledge of the medium structuration at scales ranging from nanometers (molecules) to a few micrometers (crystals). For this purpose, the behavior of a waxy crude oil in the bulk was compared to that of a model oil over a wide range of temperatures above and below the wax appearance temperature. The combined use of cross-polarized microscopy (CPM) and the implementation of innovative techniques for the field such as small- and wide-angle X-ray scattering and low-field nuclear magnetic resonance has provided a more precise idea of the structure of these two types of fluids. If the nature of the orthorhombic crystals and their lamellar shape are identical for both fluids, a very appreciable difference is highlighted in their chain axis dimensions. The n-paraffin crystal size is larger than 120 nm in the model oil. In crude oil, it is only about 1–10 nm with a long-range order in the directions perpendicular to the chain axis and a monomolecular thickness in the chain axis. Moreover, from the model oil CPM images, we observed aggregates of lamellar shape crystals. Because the model oil does not contain asphaltenes and resins, the crystals are larger and the branches divide significantly less than in crude oil, which results in a trapped liquid proton population unobservable in the model oil. All these observations give a vision of the structure of n-paraffin crystals. It is made of aggregates of relatively dense lamellae in the center and more aerated lamellae at the periphery, which split into several branches.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-radiation 3aasphaltenes 3aenergy 3alight microscopy 3aliquids 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aoils 3apetroleum 3aprediction 3atemperature 3atransportation 3awide-angle X-ray scattering1 aChevalier, Thibaud1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8658-36941 aLevitz, Pierre1 aDarbouret, Myriam1 aPalermo, Thierry1 aVinay, Guillaume1 aBarré, Loïc0 tEnergy & fuels.g2020 Sept. 15, v. 34, no. 10 p.12429-12439dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23338x1520-50297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.energyfuels.0c024533Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02597naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002800145245007600173300001600249520156700265592002801832650002401860650002601884650001201910650001101922650001901933650001201952650001201964650001501976650001701991650001002008650002002018650001702038651001802055773009302073856004802166852000902214655001202223IND4465740420221118053243.0120307e201204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446574042DNAL7 a10.1007/s10584-012-0421-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAnderegg, William R. L.10aComplex aspen forest carbon and root dynamics during drought : A letter  ap. 983-991.  aDrought-induced vegetation mortality has been documented on every vegetated continent in recent decades and constitutes a major uncertainty in climate change impacts on terrestrial ecosystems and carbon cycle feedbacks. While recent research has focused on specific failure mechanisms during drought-induced forest die-off, a broader understanding of the physiology of trees under drought, especially changes in growth and carbon allocation, is needed for determining the sensitivity of forests to drought and interacting mechanisms during forest mortality. I present here multi-tissue and high-resolution temporal dynamics of tree carbon resources during moderate experimental and natural drought in trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides) forests, a major forest type in western North America that recently experienced widespread drought-induced die-off. Drought led to substantial declines in inferred carbon uptake. Tree carbohydrate concentrations, however, largely increased in concert with substantial decreases in growth and severe declines in root biomass. These findings highlight that growth declines, especially in fine roots which are important to water uptake, and increased carbon allocation to root non-structural carbohydrates are key responses to drought in aspen and could play an important role in widespread die-off. They suggest multi-year consequences of drought and carbon-hydraulic interconnections. They underscore the need for a more integrated multi-tissue, multi-process, and multi-year perspective of climate-induced forest mortality.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPopulus tremuloides 3abiogeochemical cycles 3abiomass 3acarbon 3aclimate change 3adie-off 3adrought 3aecosystems 3aforest types 3aroots 3atree physiology 3awater uptake 3aNorth America0 tClimatic change.g2012 Apr., v. 111, no. 3-4 p.983-991dSpringer-Verlagx0165-00097nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10584-012-0421-9  aDNAL 7aarticle02435naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005500150245015200205300001600357500001900373520102500392592002801417650001301445650000901458650002401467650001401491650001401505650001401519650001901533650001901552653004201571653003801613653002501651653002901676653002801705700005601733700001601789700001501805773009901820856008501919852000902004655001202013IND60701484620221121051919.0200819e202008  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070148462DNAL7 a10.1016/j.powtec.2020.07.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYuan, Shuai1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9636-080910aIndividual enrichment of manganese and iron from complex refractory ferromanganese ore by suspension magnetization roasting and magnetic separation  ap. 689-701.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aOwing to its complex characteristics, the large-scale utilization of ferromanganese ore is limited by the traditional processes. In this study, suspension magnetization roasting and magnetic separation technology was proposed, and the thermodynamics, phase and magnetic transformation, and microstructure evolution of the main minerals were systematically investigated during roasting. Results show that iron concentrate with iron grade of 68.31% at a recovery of 96.34% can be obtained in the magnetic separation concentrate, and manganese concentrate with manganese grade of 33.70% at a recovery of 86.83% can be obtained in magnetic separation tailings under optimum conditions. Pyrolusite and braunite were reduced to weak magnetic manganosite, and weak magnetic hematite was selectively transformed into strong magnetic magnetite. Many cracks appeared in the ores owing to the multiple reduction and dehydration reactions of ferromanganese ore, which was favorable for grinding and separation of manganese and iron.  aPublisher supplied data 3ahematite 3airon 3amagnetic separation 3amagnetism 3amagnetite 3amanganese 3amicrostructure 3athermodynamics 0aComplex refractory ferromanganese ore 0aSuspension magnetization roasting 0aPhase transformation 0aMicrostructure evolution 0aMagnetic transformation1 aZhou, Wentao1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0453-15411 aHan, Yuexin1 aLi, Yanjun0 tPowder technology.g2020 Aug., v. 373 p.689-701dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11732x0032-59107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.powtec.2020.07.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02989naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100003500148245009500183300001600278520198600294592002802280650001802308650001202326650001402338650001602352650001302368651000902381700001802390700005802408773011702466856008302583852000902666655001202675IND60743389520221119034226.0211117e202107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074338952DNAL7 a10.1007/s10228-020-00794-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlavi-Yeganeh, Mohammad Sadegh12aA new ponyfish, Deveximentum mekranensis (Teleostei: Leiognathidae), from the Gulf of Oman  ap. 437-444.  aA new species of ponyfish, Deveximentum mekranensis, is described based on specimens collected from the Gulf of Oman. The new species is distinguishable from its congeners by the following combination of characters: dark dots arranged in a grid pattern on dorsolateral body without vertical lines, naked cheek and anterior breast, a single monocuspid preorbital spine, 70–85 lateral-line scales, and relatively slender body (body depth 37–49% of standard length). Deveximentum mekranensis is the closest in molecular phylogeny to Deveximentum indicium (Monkolprasit 1973), both composing a monophyletic clade. Although both species share a naked cheek, a single monocuspid preorbital spine and a comparatively slender body, D. mekranensis is distinguishable from D. indicium by having dark dots on dorsolateral body without vertical lines (vs. vertical markings composed of short vertical lines and dots) and fewer lateral-line scales (70–85 vs. 86–111). Deveximentum mekranensis is apparently similar to Deveximentum mazavasaoka (Baldwin and Sparks 2011) in the pattern of dark dots dorsolaterally on the body. However, the former can be distinguished from the latter by having a naked anterior breast (vs. almost fully scaly). Deveximentum hanedai (Mochizuki and Hayashi 1989) has an oblong body without dark vertical lines on posterior dorsolateral body. Deveximentum mekranensis is distinguishable from D. hanedai by lacking irregular vertical dark bands on anterior dorsolateral body and having a single preorbital spine (vs. two preorbital spines), and additionally more lateral-line scales (70–85 vs. 62–70). Deveximentum mekranensis differs from Deveximentum insidiator (Bloch 1787) in the pattern of anterior dorsolateral body (irregular vertical bands absent vs. present), and from Deveximentum interruptum (Valenciennes in Cuvier and Valenciennes 1835) and Deveximentum megalolepis (Mochizuki and Hayashi 1989) in lacking scales on cheek and anterior breast.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLeiognathidae 3abreasts 3amonophyly 3anew species 3aresearch 3aOman1 aKhajavi, Mina1 aKimura, Seishi1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6844-58640 tIchthyological research.g2021 July, v. 68, no. 3 p.437-444dSpringer JapanwJournal:jnl4124684x1341-89987nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10228-020-00794-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02278naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245013500168300001600303520097100319592002801290650001501318650002001333650001601353650001101369650001201380650001301392650001301405650002101418650002501439650001101464650004001475650001101515650001201526650001101538653001601549653002301565653001401588653001501602653001201617773011001629856008401739852000901823655001201832IND60121881020221117233449.0150325e20140512xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012188102DNAL7 a10.1080/01904167.2013.8734642doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRiga, Patrick10aFlower abscission in pepper plants grown under different regimes of nitrogen fertilization and photosynthetically active radiation  ap. 907-927.  aThe effect of nitrogen fertilization on flower abscission in pepper was studied under different growth regimes. The pepper plants were irrigated with 4, 9, and 14 meq L ⁻¹of nitrate (N4, N9, and N14). The plants were grown in winter under a low level (639 mol m ⁻²) of cumulative photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) (L PAR), and in spring under a high level (1074 mol m ⁻²) of cumulative PAR (H PAR). The number of flowers and flower abscission were higher under H PAR than under L PAR. Flower abscission was higher in response to treatment N4, than in response to treatments N9 and N14, while the flower number was significantly lower. Flower abscission was strongly correlated with growth-related parameters as well as with the carbon or nitrogen contents in plants. Neither the sucrose fluxes nor the amino acid fluxes through the flower pedicels were affected by nitrogen supply.

The review focused on the natural regeneration of maritime pine within its most representative areas (Portugal, Spain, and France). First, a brief characterisation of the main phases of the natural regeneration of maritime pine is described. Next, information on the factors affecting the natural regeneration of the species is provided, highlighting its positive and negative effects. Finally, management proposals are presented to promote the natural regeneration of maritime pine species. Numerous factors influencing the natural regeneration of maritime pine were identified. Fires and climatic factors can intervene in all three regeneration phases (seeding, germination, and seedling survival and development). The natural regeneration failure of maritime pine species can be aggravated in drier scenarios. Forest management plays an important role as it can promote the natural regeneration of the species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPinus pinaster 3aforest management 3agermination 3anatural regeneration 3aseedlings 3asowing 3aFrance 3aPortugal 3aSpain1 aCerveira, Adelaide 1 aSoares, Paula 1 aFonseca, Teresa 0 tForests.g2022 Feb. 26, v. 13, no. 3dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2257x1999-49077nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/f130303863Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02380naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002000139245013900159300001600298520131100314592002801625650001101653650001501664650001301679650001201692650001401704650001401718650001301732650001301745651001301758700001701771773017201788856007301960852000902033655001202042IND60080380720221120062312.0140728e201409  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008038072DNAL7 a10.1111/aje.121262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAtickem, Anagaw10aLivestock‐wildlife conflicts in the Ethiopian highlands: assessing the dietary and spatial overlap between mountain nyala and cattle  ap. 343-351.  aLivestock grazing is an increasing conservation challenge throughout protected wildlife areas in Africa. We report here on a negative correlation in abundance between cattle and the mountain nyala across seven study areas in the Bale Mountains of Ethiopia, and investigate if this can be explained by similarity in feeding ecology and spatial overlap. Mountain nyala foraging behaviour was studied using scan sampling of 17 GPS/VHF‐collared animals, while faecal sampling of both species was used to quantify abundance and spatial overlap. We found that female and male mountain nyala grazed during 87% and 50% of the feeding observations respectively. Although mountain nyala has earlier been classified as a browser, our findings indicate a feeding ecology closer to a grazer. The overall spatial overlap between mountain nyala and cattle was 22%, with a range of 2.4–100% among areas, and illegal cattle grazing was common. Based on the negative correlation in abundance, the similarity in feeding ecology and the relatively high spatial overlap we speculate that a competitive interaction between mountain nyala and cattle might occur. Our findings points to the potential for existence of a wildlife‐cattle conflict also in the Ethiopian highlands, as frequently reported in savannah ecosystems.  aPublisher supplied data 3acattle 3aecosystems 3aforaging 3agrazing 3ahighlands 3amountains 3asavannas 3awildlife 3aEthiopia1 aLoe, Leif E.0 tAfrican journal of ecology.g2014 Sept., v. 52, no. 3 p.343-351dPublished for the East African Wild Life Society by Blackwell Scientific Publicationsx0141-67077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/aje.121263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03151naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006500148245012200213300001600335520161700351592002801968596005201996596008702048596005602135650002002191650001302211650001102224650000902235650002202244650000902266650002202275650000902297650001402306650001302320650002502333651001202358651001102370651001002381700001802391700002202409700002302431700001802454773011702472856008302589852000902672655001202681IND60743389720221119034035.0211117e202107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074338972DNAL7 a10.1007/s10228-020-00797-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIglésias, Samuel P.,1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2926-977010aGobius xoriguer, a new offshore Mediterranean goby (Gobiidae), and phylogenetic relationships within the genus Gobius  ap. 445-459.  aGobius xoriguer sp. nov., a new ofshore species of goby (Teleostei: Gobiidae: Gobiinae) is described based on three specimens collected in 2010, 2012 and 2018 in the western Mediterranean, off Menorca (Spain), in the Gulf of Lion and off Corsica (France), at 51–104 m depth on coralline algae sea bed. It is easily distinguishable from its Atlantic-Mediterranean congeners by the combination of the following characters: large eyes, ~27–28% of head length; anterior nostril with a small triangular process; 14 soft rays on D2, 13 soft rays on A; enlarged first dorsal fin rays (adult males), with third D1 spine the longest, 23–27 % SL; uppermost P fin rays not free from membrane; long V-shape pelvic fins with vestigial frenum; 50–51 scales on LL; head oculoscapular canal with pores σ, λ, κ, ω, α, β, ρ, ρ1, ρ2, and preopercular canal with pores γ, δ, ε present; row x1 ending anteriorly behind pore β; a groove section between pore ρ and ρ1; suborbital row d discontinuous with large gap below suborbital rows 3 and 4; rows o separated; seven enlarged orange blotches on body side; white dotes on cheek and opercle on an orange background. With a known maximum size of 64 mm TL, it is among the smaller species of Gobius. Bayesian inference and Maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree topologies based on mitochondrial DNA COI sequences (barcoding region), including most Atlantic-Mediterranean Gobius species, support Gobius gasteveni Miller 1974 as the closest relative to Gobius xoriguer sp. nov. These sister species exhibit a high genetic divergence of 9.5% (uncorrected p-distance).  aPublisher supplied data  a1192217cGrant Agency of the Charles University  aDKRVO 2019-2023/6.III.c National MuseumcMinistry of Culture of the Czech Republic  a00023272cMinistry of Culture of the Czech Republic 3aBayesian theory 3aGobiidae 3aadults 3afins 3agenetic variation 3ahead 3amitochondrial DNA 3anose 3aphylogeny 3aresearch 3astatistical analysis 3aCorsica 3aFrance 3aSpain1 aVukić, Jasna1 aSellos, Daniel Y.1 aSoukupová, Tereza1 aŠanda, Radek0 tIchthyological research.g2021 July, v. 68, no. 3 p.445-459dSpringer JapanwJournal:jnl4124684x1341-89987nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10228-020-00797-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02797naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002900139245011100168300001600279500002000295520160700315592002801922650001601950650001601966650001901982650001102001650001502012650002002027650001302047650002002060650001402080650001902094650001402113700002402127700005902151773011902210856007302329852000902402655001202411IND60649072420221116143700.0190702e201907  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064907242DNAL7 a10.1111/vsu.132362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChapman, Hannah‐Sophie10aArthrodesis of the metacarpophalangeal and metatarsophalangeal joints to treat osteoarthritis in 17 horses  ap. 850-857.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aOBJECTIVE: To describe arthrodesis of the metacarpophalangeal (MCP) or metatarsophalangeal (MTP) joint with a locking compression plate (LCP) and a metallic tension band and report the outcome of horses treated for osteoarthritis (OA) with this technique. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective case series. ANIMALS: Seventeen horses with OA of the MCP or MTP joint treated with arthrodesis. METHODS: Medical records (2004‐2017) of horses treated for OA with arthrodesis of the MCP or MTP joint with an LCP and metallic tension band were reviewed. Preoperative variables included age, sex, breed, affected limb, and lameness grade. Surgical variables included implants used, surgery time, postoperative angle of joint, intraoperative complications, and anesthetic recovery method. Outcome was obtained from medical records and phone interviews. RESULTS: Lameness was scored as 4 out of 5 (range, 2‐4) in 13 of 17 horses. All horses survived to discharge and were alive >6 months postoperatively, without any report of long‐term complications. All horses were allowed unrestricted turnout, and 1 horse was lightly ridden. No postoperative infections or implant failures were reported. The only complications consisted of cast sores (n = 4). CONCLUSION: Arthrodesis of the MCP/MTP joint was associated with acceptable morbidity and good long‐term outcomes in these 17 horses with OA refractory to medical management. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: The morbidity and prognosis after fetlock arthrodesis for OA seem more favorable than reported in horses treated with traumatic disruption of the suspensory apparatus.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanesthetics 3aarthrodesis 3ahorse diseases 3ahorses 3ainterviews 3ajoints (animal) 3alameness 3amedical records 3amorbidity 3aosteoarthritis 3aprognosis1 aRichardson, Dean W.1 aOrtved, Kyla F.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0398-24440 tVeterinary surgery.g2019 July, v. 48, no. 5 p.850-857dJohn Wiley & Sons, Inc.wJournal:jnl10192x0161-34997nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/vsu.132363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02809naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001400146245009900160300001800259520153400277592002801811650001301839650002501852650001601877650001101893650002101904650000901925650002301934650001201957650001301969700001701982700001701999700001502016700001702031700001802048700001802066700001602084700001802100700001802118700001602136773012002152856008202272852000902354655001202363IND60565666320221119035040.0170325e20170309xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056566632DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcb.6b124722doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChe, Xing10aSingle Mutations Reshape the Structural Correlation Network of the DMXAA–Human STING Complex  ap. 2073-2082.  aSubtle changes in protein sequences are able to alter ligand–protein interactions. Unraveling the mechanism of such phenomena is important for understanding ligand–protein interactions, including the DMXAA–STING interaction. DMXAA specifically binds to mouse STING instead of human STING. However, the S162A mutation and a newly discovered E260I mutation endow human STINGᴬQ with DMXAA sensitivity. Through molecular dynamics simulations, we revealed how these single mutations alter the DMXAA–STING interaction. Compared to mutated systems, structural correlations in the interaction of STINGᴬQ with DMXAA are stronger, and the correlations are cross-protomers in the dimeric protein. Analyses on correlation coefficients lead to the identification of two key interactions that mediate the strong cross-protomer correlation in the DMXAA–STINGᴬQ interaction network: DMXAA–267T–162S* and 238R–260E*. These two interactions are partially and totally interrupted by the S162A and E260I mutations, respectively. Moreover, a smaller number of water molecules are displaced upon DMXAA binding to STINGᴬQ than that on binding to its mutants, leading to a larger entropic penalty for the former. Considering the sensitivity of STINGᴬQ and two of its mutants to DMXAA, a strong structural correlation appears to discourage DMXAA–STING binding. Such an observation suggests that DMXAA derivatives, which are deprived of hydrogen-bond interaction with both 162S* and 267T, are potential agonists of human STING.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagonists 3aamino acid sequences 3acorrelation 3ahumans 3ahydrogen bonding 3amice 3amolecular dynamics 3amutants 3amutation1 aDu, Xiao-Xia1 aCai, Xiaoxia1 aZhang, Jun1 aXie, Wen Jun1 aLong, Zhuoran1 aYe, Zhao-Yang1 aZhang, Heng1 aYang, Lijiang1 aSu, Xiao-Dong1 aGao, Yi Qin0 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2017 Mar. 09, v. 121, no. 9 p.2073-2082dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-52077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.jpcb.6b124723Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02488naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001900139245011600158300001600274520126300290592002801553650002301581650002901604650002601633650001001659650001201669650001201681650001501693650001901708650001501727650001301742650001801755650001201773650002701785650001101812651001301823773017201836856007302008852000902081655001202090IND60080381020221121051848.0140728e201409  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008038102DNAL7 a10.1111/aje.121142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGandiwa, Edson10aVegetation factors influencing density and distribution of wild large herbivores in a southern African savannah  ap. 274-283.  aUnderstanding factors influencing large herbivore densities and distribution in terrestrial ecosystems is a fundamental goal of ecology. This study examined environmental factors influencing the density and distribution of wild large herbivores in Gonarezhou National Park, Zimbabwe. Vegetation and surface water were predicted to have a stronger influence than anthropogenic‐related disturbances (livestock grazing, fires, settlements and poaching) on the density and distribution of wild large herbivores. Aerial survey data for seven common wild large herbivores conducted in 2007 and 2009 and environmental data were collected. Only grass cover explained a significant proportion of the variation in large herbivore densities and distribution. Moreover, only two species densities significantly differed across the Gonarezhou, namely impala and zebra. In contrast, buffalo, elephant, giraffe, kudu and nyala densities did not differ significantly across the Gonarezhou. Overall, the findings only partly support the study prediction. The study results suggest the need to further investigate the roles of environmental factors at smaller scales in order to tease out their relative strengths in influencing density and distribution of large herbivores.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAepyceros melampus 3aTragelaphus strepsiceros 3aenvironmental factors 3afires 3agrasses 3agrazing 3aherbivores 3anational parks 3aprediction 3asavannas 3asurface water 3asurveys 3aterrestrial ecosystems 3azebras 3aZimbabwe0 tAfrican journal of ecology.g2014 Sept., v. 52, no. 3 p.274-283dPublished for the East African Wild Life Society by Blackwell Scientific Publicationsx0141-67077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/aje.121143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03353naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245007900169300001400248520179800262592002802060650002502088650002402113650002002137650001002157650001302167650001902180650001502199650001002214650001802224650001202242650001102254650001202265650001402277650001502291650002202306650001502328650001102343650000902354650001102363650001302374650001102387651001002398653001602408653001702424653001502441653001502456653002102471653001202492700002202504700002202526700001902548773010202567856008502669852000902754655001202763IND60546253420221117223020.0160903e20140215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054625342DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jenvman.2014.01.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFogli, Simona10aMowing regime has different effects on reed stands in relation to habitat  ap. 56-62.  aReed (Phragmites australis) is widespread in aquatic habitats in Europe where it plays an important ecological role, especially as stabilizer of lake and river shores and as filter against pollutants. Reed is also abundant in ecotones towards terrestrial habitats, especially fen meadows, where its expansion can out-compete rare slowly-growing fen species. Therefore, defining appropriate guidelines for managing reed in wetlands has to consider differences in the ecological roles that reed plays in different wetland habitats. In a small pre-alpine lake in N Italy, we mowed reed stands in three plant communities located along a transect from the lake shore to the periphery. In each community, three areas were subjected to reed mowing in late winter, as traditionally done in the past. Three additional areas were subjected to mowing in winter and summer, while three areas served as un-treated controls. Summer mowing was carried out in August, when the nesting period of birds was concluded. Mowing in winter did not affect reed aboveground biomass (RAB) in any community but enhanced the efficiency of removing nutrients by reducing litter accumulation in the soil. Mowing in winter and summer only slightly decreased RAB in the riparian community, not at all in the intermediate community but significantly diminished RAB in fen meadows. Phosphorus deficiency and/or reduced competition with other species probably accounted for RAB reduction in fen meadows. In conclusion, winter mowing can be overall recommended for preventing eutrophication of littoral habitats while summer mowing is advisable for preventing reed expansion in fen meadows. However, the timing of summer mowing has to be defined considering all requirements needed for optimal management of each individual site.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPhragmites australis 3aaboveground biomass 3aaquatic habitat 3abirds 3aecotones 3aeutrophication 3aguidelines 3alakes 3alittoral zone 3ameadows 3amowing 3anesting 3anutrients 3aphosphorus 3aplant communities 3apollutants 3arivers 3asoil 3asummer 3awetlands 3awinter 3aItaly 0aCompetition 0aConservation 0aFen meadow 0aManagement 0aPriority habitat 0aWetland1 aBrancaleoni, Lisa1 aLambertini, Carla1 aGerdol, Renato0 tJournal of environmental management.g2014 Feb. 15, v. 134 p.56-62dElsevier Ltdx0301-47977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2014.01.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03004naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001600139245013800155300001600293500002000309520172700329592002802056650001002084650002002094650001102114650001402125650001602139650001502155650001402170650002002184650002002204700006502224700005702289700002302346700001702369700001902386773011902405856007302524852000902597655001202606IND60649072620221116143719.0190702e201907  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064907262DNAL7 a10.1111/vsu.131842doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPye, Jannah10aPreoperative factors associated with resection and anastomosis in horses presenting with strangulating lesions of the small intestine  ap. 786-794.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aOBJECTIVE: To determine if preoperative and intraoperative clinical variables correlate with resection and anastomosis (RA) in horses presenting with strangulating small intestinal (SI) lesions. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective case series. ANIMALS: Horses undergoing exploratory celiotomy for a strangulating SI lesion (n = 243). METHODS: The records of horses undergoing surgical correction for strangulating SI lesions from January 1, 2000 to December 31, 2017 were reviewed. Horses were categorized as treated with RA or not treated with RA. Obtained information included history, signalment, clinical findings, diagnostic test results, intraoperative findings, and survival to discharge. Univariable and multivariable analyses were used to compare data between horses treated with RA vs those not treated with RA (P = .05). RESULTS: In total, 172 SI lesions were resected, and 71 were not resected. Horses that had gastric reflux at admission to the hospital (odds ratio [OR] 5.56; 95% CI 1.76, 17.59) and horses with amotile SI according to abdominal ultrasonography (OR 9.69; 95% CI 3.09, 30.37) were more likely to undergo RA. Increased difference between peritoneal fluid and blood lactate was higher in horses that underwent RA (OR 1.55; 95% CI 1.12, 2.13). Survival to hospital discharge was lower in the group of horses that underwent RA compared with horses that did not undergo RA. CONCLUSION: Resection and anastomosis of strangulating SI lesions was associated with several preoperative variables. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: This study highlights the value of preoperative diagnostic procedures in aiding intraoperative decision making and prognostication in horses presenting with strangulating SI lesions.  aPublisher supplied data 3ablood 3adecision making 3ahorses 3ahospitals 3alactic acid 3aodds ratio 3aresection 3asmall intestine 3aultrasonography1 aEspinosa‐Mur, Pablo1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4385-10001 aRoca, Rodrigo1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5023-10671 aKilcoyne, Isabelle1 aNieto, Jorge1 aDechant, Julie0 tVeterinary surgery.g2019 July, v. 48, no. 5 p.786-794dJohn Wiley & Sons, Inc.wJournal:jnl10192x0161-34997nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/vsu.131843Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01637naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002100139245015000160300001800310520066900328592002800997650001101025650000901036650001901045650001301064700002401077700002201101700002301123773010501146856007501251852000901326655001201335IND60577845320221119194952.0170810e20130813xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057784532DNAL7 a10.1021/ma401169q2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOlah, Michael

The polymers are prepared in high yields with short polymerization times and are accessible in lengths extending to thousands of repeating units. End-caps are introduced with a variety of functional groups, which provides access to polymers with selective response properties. The end-capped polymers are stable to acid, base, and heat, but depolymerize completely within minutes of removal of the end-cap and treatment of the un-end-capped polymer with base.  aPublisher supplied data 3aethers 3aheat 3apolymerization 3apolymers1 aRobbins, Jessica S.1 aBaker, Matthew S.1 aPhillips, Scott T.0 tMacromolecules.g2013 Aug. 13, v. 46, no. 15 p.5924-5928dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fma401169q3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01693naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001100150245008000161300001200241520065700253592002800910650001100938650002200949650001100971650001400982653001100996653002301007653001301030653001601043653001801059700001301077700001501090700001301105773012001118856008401238852000901322655001201331IND60121881520221117233511.0150325e20140101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012188152DNAL7 a10.1080/02773813.2013.7992132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFu, Y.10aPyrolysis Products of Lignin in Open and Sealed Vessels Studied by Py-GC-MS  ap. 1-7.  aThe pyrolysis products of lignin in open and sealed vessels were studied by pyrolysis—gas chromatography—mass spectrometry (Py-GC-MS).

Herein, we have constructed a novel TiO₂@UiO-66-NH₂ nanocomposite through a convenient one-step solvothermal technique. The TiO₂@UiO-66-NH₂ nanocomposite displayed outstanding adsorption and photodegradation performances toward TC in aqueous solution under restricted space and visible light illumination. The improved catalytic ability was mainly caused by the enhanced adsorption property and the successful transfer of photogenerated electrons to the conduction band of TiO₂@UiO-66-NH₂. Importantly, the photocatalyst efficiency was not tremendously decreased even after the fourth round of recycling, indicating its good stability and reusability. We believe that our study could be conducive to the future design and accomplishment of MOF surface interactions with organic pollutants, expanding the application of MOFs and photocatalysts for elimination of pollutants from wastewater.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3aaqueous solutions 3acoordination polymers 3aenergy 3alight 3alighting 3ananocomposites 3aphotocatalysis 3aphotocatalysts 3aphotolysis 3atetracycline 3awastewater 3awater purification1 aFang, Xiuxuan1 aZhu, Yingzhi1 aMa, Na1 aDai, Wei1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9377-11510 tEnergy & fuels.g2020 Sept. 14, v. 34, no. 10 p.12911-12917dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23338x1520-50297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.energyfuels.0c024853Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02715naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002100152245014300173300001400316500001500330520107400345592002801419650002201447650001101469650002001480650002501500650000901525650004201534650001401576650005201590650002101642650001301663650001201676650000801688650001401696651001101710651001001721653001901731653002701750653000801777653003101785653002001816700002001836700003001856700003301886700002301919700001901942700002101961773009601982856008602078852000902164655001202173IND60590498820221118072557.0180313e20180302xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059049882DNAL7 a10.1016/j.virusres.2018.01.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMaganga, Gael D.10aMolecular characterization of complete genome of a canine distemper virus associated with fatal infection in dogs in Gabon, Central Africa  ap. 21-25.  a2019-12-06  aCanine distemper (CD) is the most deadly disease in dogs with mortality rates reaching 50%. The pathological agent, the CD virus (CDV), generally causes a severe systemic disease, although the nervous form can coexist with the acute catarrhal form in the same individual. In this study, we describe an outbreak of 18 cases of CD that occurred in 2015 in a German Shepherd dog population in northwestern Gabon. In addition, we determined the sequence of the CDV genotype associated with this fatal distemper infection in Gabon and compared it with other published CDV sequences. The CDV was detected using RT-PCR on cDNA from RNA of harvested brains and other organs. The identification was confirmed by sequencing amplicons. Moreover, we obtained the whole genome sequence using high-throughput sequencing. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that Gabonese CDV strain clustered with European strains belonging to the Europe genotype.

As the domestic sector of Saudi Arabia is the largest consumer of electricity, the needs of energy efficiency (EE) must start in the homes of its inhabitants. Due to a harsh climate most of the year plus the cheapest electricity rates in the world, the EE culture is finding it difficult to penetrate the population. The Government of Saudi Arabia is striving hard to focus the EE programmes on the industrial and commercial sectors. With the proposed introduction of the Efficient Management of Electrical Energy Regulation, and amendments, EE within the commercial and industrial sector would be further enhanced. These developments, coupled with the recent increase in energy cost worldwide, spells a real need to develop local experts with the required knowledge and experience in EE. This article discusses various aspects of EE and certification of Energy Managers in terms of academic requirements as well as the accreditation requirements needed from training institutes. Various technical aspects of the process have been discussed in view of labour-market requirements and perspective.  aPublisher supplied data 3acertification 3aclimate 3aelectricity 3aenergy costs 3aenergy efficiency 3aexperts 3ahuman resources 3aindustry 3amanagers 3aoils 3aSaudi Arabia 0aEnergy managers 0aEnergy efficiency 0aCertification methods1 aHussain, Ahmad1 aMobarak, Youssef0 tEnergy Policy.g2014 Jan., v. 64 p.203-208dElsevier Ltdx0301-42157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enpol.2013.08.0693Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01956naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001700139245011200156300001800268520103500286592002801321650002101349650002101370650002701391650001601418650002501434700001801459773010501477856007501582852000901657655001201666IND60577845520221119195321.0170810e20130813xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057784552DNAL7 a10.1021/ma401210z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCasalini, R.10aDensity Scaling of the Structural and Johari–Goldstein Secondary Relaxations in Poly(methyl methacrylate)  ap. 6364-6368.  aDielectric spectra were obtained on a low molecular weight poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) over a range of temperatures (331 < T (K) < 386) at pressures approaching 0.8 GPa. The α relaxation times, τα, superpose when plotted versus T/ρᵞ, where ρ is density and γ a material constant, in accord with results for many other van der Waals liquids and polymers. However, the Johari–Goldstein (JG) relaxation times, τJG, do not conform to this density scaling for the same value of the exponent γ. Likewise, the frequency separation of the α and JG loss peaks in the spectrum increases with pressure for constant τα; that is, state points having the same α relaxation time and same peak breadth have different τJG. Similar results were obtained on a lower molecular weight PMMA, for which there was less overlap of the two peaks. The implication is that density scaling of the segmental relaxation times originates in the glass transition dynamics, not, as recently suggested, in higher frequency secondary processes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aglass transition 3amolecular weight 3apolymethylmethacrylate 3atemperature 3avan der Waals forces1 aRoland, C.

Its biofilm potential, cellulose production, and the expression of type 1 pili and curli fimbriae were measured by in vitro assays. The strain was highly pathogenic in the zebrafish embryo model of infection, where it killed all embryos within 24 h post inoculation (hpi) at doses as low as 1000 colony forming units. Zebrafish embryos inoculated with similar doses of commensal E. coli strains showed no signs of disease, and cleared the bacteria within 24 h. E. coli K46 colonized the murine gut at the same level as the uropathogenic E. coli (UPEC) reference strain CFT073 in CBA/J mice after oral inoculation, but infected the murine bladder significantly less than CFT073 after transurethral inoculation. Type 1 pili were clearly expressed by E. coli K46, while curli fimbriae and cellulose production were weakly expressed. The ability to produce biofilm varied in different growth media, but overall E. coli K46 was a poorer biofilm producer compared to the reference strain E. coli UTI89. In conclusion, the zebrafish lethality model provides further evidence that E. coli K46 is highly pathogenic and might be useful in future studies to identify bacterial virulence factors.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDanio rerio 3aanimal models 3abacteria 3abiofilm 3abladder 3acellulose 3aculture media 3adigestive system 3afimbriae 3ain vitro studies 3alambs 3amice 3amortality 3aoral administration 3asepticemia 3auropathogenic Escherichia coli 3avirulence1 aBarber, AmeliaE.1 aNorton, J.Paul1 aMulvey, MatthewA.1 aL’Abée-Lund, TrineM.1http://orcid.org/0000-0002-3886-61390 tVeterinary research.g2017 Dec., v. 48, no. 1 p.3-3dBioMed CentralwJournal:jnl4142873x1297-97167nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13567-016-0407-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02512naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002600151245010500177300001800282520123200300592002801532596004401560596005101604596005201655650001501707650001901722650001401741650002001755650001801775650001801793650001801811700002601829700001901855700001901874700002001893773011901913856008502032852000902117655001202126IND60624850020221117025258.0181206e20170501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062485002DNAL7 a10.1093/bioinformatics/btw7932doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLafond-Lapalme, Joël12aA new method for decontamination of de novo transcriptomes using a hierarchical clustering algorithm  ap. 1293-1300.  aMotivation: The identification of contaminating sequences in a de novo assembly is challenging because of the absence of information on the target species. For sample types where the target organism is impossible to isolate from its matrix, such as endoparasites, endosymbionts and soil-harvested samples, contamination is unavoidable. A few post-assembly decontamination methods are currently available but are based only on alignments to databases, which can lead to poor decontamination. Results: We present a new decontamination method based on a hierarchical clustering algorithm called MCSC. This method uses frequent patterns found in sequences to create clusters. These clusters are then linked to the target species or tagged as contaminants using classic alignment tools. The main advantage of this decontamination method is that it allows sequences to be tagged correctly even if they are unknown or misaligned to a database.

In the present study, a systematic review and a meta‐analysis of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) were conducted aiming to evaluate the effect of magnesium supplementation on type 2 diabetes (T2D) associated cardiovascular risk factors in both diabetic and nondiabetic individuals. METHODS: PubMed, Scopus, Cochrane, Web of Science and Google Scholar databases were searched from inception to 30 June 2016 aiming to identify RCTs evaluating the effect of magnesium supplementation on T2D associated cardiovascular risk factors. The data were analysed using a random effect model with inverse variance methodology. Sensitivity analysis, risk of bias analysis, subgroup analysis, meta‐regression and publication bias analysis were also conducted for the included studies using standard methods. RESULTS: Following magnesium supplementation, a significant improvement was observed in fasting plasma glucose (FPG) [weighted mean difference (WMD) = −4.641 mg dL⁻¹, 95% confidence interval (CI) = −7.602, −1.680, P = 0.002], high‐density lipoprotein (HDL) (WMD = 3.197 mg dL⁻¹, 95% CI = 1.455, 4.938, P < 0.001), low‐density lipoprotein (LDL) (WMD = −10.668 mg dL⁻¹, 95% CI = −19.108, −2.228, P = 0.013), plasma triglycerides (TG) (WMD = −15.323 mg dL⁻¹, 95% CI = −28.821, −1.826, P = 0.026) and systolic blood pressure (SBP) (WMD = −3.056 mmHg, 95% CI = −5.509, −0.603, P = 0.015). During subgroup analysis, a more beneficial effect of magnesium supplementation was observed in diabetic subjects with hypomagnesaemia. CONCLUSIONS: Magnesium supplementation can produce a favourable effect on FPG, HDL, LDL, TG and SBP. Therefore, magnesium supplementation may decrease the risk T2D associated cardiovascular diseases, although future large RCTs are needed for making robust guidelines for clinical practice.  aPublisher supplied data 3ablood glucose 3acardiovascular diseases 3aconfidence interval 3adatabases 3adeath 3aguidelines 3ahigh density lipoprotein 3alow density lipoprotein 3amagnesium 3ameta-analysis 3amodels 3anoninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 3apatients 3arandomized clinical trials 3arisk factors 3asystematic review 3asystolic blood pressure 3atriacylglycerols 3avariance1 aGarg, R.0 tJournal of human nutrition and dietetics.g2017 Oct., v. 30, no. 5 p.621-633dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx0952-38717nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jhn.124543Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02834naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001500142245010400157300002000261520123500281592002801516596009201544596011601636596007501752596005701827596009201884650002101976650001901997650001302016650001802029650001802047650001302065650001402078650001102092700002002103700001502123700005102138773014902189856007702338852000902415655001202424IND60793374220221121154128.0220914e20220829xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079337422DNAL7 a10.1021/jacs.2c052992doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Huimin10aRapid Screening of Bimetallic Electrocatalysts Using Single Nanoparticle Collision Electrochemistry  ap. 16480-16489.  aThe pace of nanomaterial discovery for high-performance electrocatalysts could be accelerated by the development of efficient screening methods. However, conventional electrochemical characterization via drop-casting is inherently inaccurate and time-consuming, as such ensemble measurements are serially performed through nanocatalyst synthesis, morphological characterization, and performance testing. Herein, we propose a rapid electrochemical screening method for bimetallic electrocatalysts that combines nanoparticle (NP) preparation and performance testing at the single NP level, thus avoiding any inhomogeneous averaging contribution. We employed single NP collision electrochemistry to realize in situ electrodeposition of a precisely tunable Pt shell onto individual parent NPs, followed by instantaneous electrocatalytic measurement of the newborn bimetallic core–shell NPs. We demonstrated the utility of this approach by screening bimetallic Au–Pt NPs and Ag–Pt NPs, thereby exhibiting promising electrocatalytic activity at optimal atomic ratios for methanol oxidation and oxygen reduction reactions, respectively. This work provides a new insight for the rapid screening of other bimetallic electrocatalysts.  aPublisher supplied data  a19ZR1472100cNatural Science Foundation of Shanghaidhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100007219  a2018SHZDZX03cScience and Technology Commission of Shanghai Municipalitydhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100003399  a201901cXiamen University Opening Project of PCOSSdhttps://doi.org/NA  a92061108cMajor Research Projectdhttps://doi.org/NA  aNAcNational Ten Thousand Talent Program for Young Top-Notch Talentdhttps://doi.org/NA 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectroplating 3amethanol 3ananocatalysts 3ananoparticles 3aneonates 3aoxidation 3aoxygen1 aZhang, Xuanxuan1 aSun, Zehui1 aMa, Wei1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0916-01500 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2022 Aug. 29, v. 144, no. 36 p.16480-16489dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19166x1520-51267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jacs.2c052993Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02702naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094024002200133024001900155040001800174100002400192245011600216300001800332506007600350520154600426592002801972506003702000650001902037650002402056650001902080651000902099700002102108700002202129773011902151856008502270852000902355655001202364IND60624850120221207083853.0181206e20170501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062485012DNAL7 a10.1093/bioinformatics/btw7942doi7 aPMC58603812pmcid7 a284536692pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHanslovsky, Philipp10aImage-based correction of continuous and discontinuous non-planar axial distortion in serial section microscopy  ap. 1379-1386.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aMotivation: Serial section microscopy is an established method for detailed anatomy reconstruction of biological specimen. During the last decade, high resolution electron microscopy (EM) of serial sections has become the de-facto standard for reconstruction of neural connectivity at ever increasing scales (EM connectomics). In serial section microscopy, the axial dimension of the volume is sampled by physically removing thin sections from the embedded specimen and subsequently imaging either the block-face or the section series. This process has limited precision leading to inhomogeneous non-planar sampling of the axial dimension of the volume which, in turn, results in distorted image volumes. This includes that section series may be collected and imaged in unknown order. Results: We developed methods to identify and correct these distortions through image-based signal analysis without any additional physical apparatus or measurements. We demonstrate the efficacy of our methods in proof of principle experiments and application to real world problems.

Various bismuth-based nanocomposites have been developed and investigated, out of which, bismuth titanates have been explored a lot for their environmental applications. They are aurivillus type of compounds belonging to the family of layered perovskites. Bismuth titanates and their nanocomposites possess the ability to degrade persistent organic pollutants, present in water and wastewater, including various dyes (rhodamine blue, methyl orange, congo red, methylene blue, malachite green, brilliant red, acid orange, acid blue), organic compounds (phenol, methanol, formic acid, salicylic acid, p –chlorophenol), pharmaceutical compounds (sulpha methoxazole, ciprofloxacin, tetracycline, carbamazepine, gatifloaxin, 17β-Estradiol) etc. In this review, the various synthesis methods of bismuth titanates are discussed. This work reviews characterization and applications of Bi₂Ti₂O₇, Bi₄Ti₃O₁₂, Bi₂Ti₄O₁₁, Bi₈Ti₄O₁₄, Bi₂₀TiO₃₂ etc. For environmental remediation. Usage of these nanomaterials are in the form of slurry or immobilized system. However, future perspectives involving more research related to the development of novel bismuth-based nanocomposite materials with superior photocatalytic properties, easy recoverability, and practicability for real systems. Further, challenges related to fabrication of pure bismuth titanates, morphology and development of bismuth titanate photocatalyst are also stated. Some novel bismuth titanate nanocomposite photocatalysts including fiber-based photocatalyst, photocatalytic membrane, floating photocatalyst etc. are also discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3abismuth 3aciprofloxacin 3aformic acid 3amalachite green 3amethanol 3amethyl orange 3amethylene blue 3ananocomposites 3aphenol 3aphotocatalysis 3aphotocatalysts 3aremediation 3arhodamines 3asalicylic acid 3aslurries 3atetracycline 3awastewater 3awastewater treatment 0aBismuth titanate 0aPhotocatalytic degradation 0aVisible-light photocatalyst 0aPersistent organic compounds 0aWastewater treatment1 aBarai, Divya P.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0602-31851 aBhanvase, Bharat A.0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2021 Oct. 10, v. 318 p.128563-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2021.1285633Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02131naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002900151245007600180300001600256520081200272592002801084650001801112650001001130650001301140650002001153650001001173650001301183650002401196650001201220650002101232650001301253650002501266650001201291650002401303650001101327653002201338653001301360653001001373653001501383653001001398653001301408700002801421700001801449773008801467856008501555852000901640655001201649IND60529706120221117191012.0160723e201602  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052970612DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tibtech.2015.11.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRosales Mendoza, Sergio,10aFood-Grade Organisms as Vaccine Biofactories and Oral Delivery Vehicles  ap. 124-136.  aThe use of food-grade organisms as recombinant vaccine expression hosts and delivery vehicles has been explored during the past 25 years, opening new avenues for vaccinology. Considering that oral immunization is a beneficial approach in terms of costs, patient comfort, and protection of mucosal tissues, the use of food-grade organisms can lead to highly advantageous vaccines in terms of costs, easy administration, and safety. The organisms currently used for this purpose are bacteria (Lactobacillus and Bacillus), yeasts, algae, plants, and insect species. Herein, a comparative and updated scenario on the production of oral vaccines in food-grade organisms is provided and placed in perspective.

L.10aIsotopic variation across the Audubon's–myrtle warbler hybrid zone  ap. 1179-1191.  aDifferences in seasonal migratory behaviours are thought to be an important component of reproductive isolation in many organisms. Stable isotopes have been used with success in estimating the location and qualities of disjunct breeding and wintering areas. However, few studies have used isotopic data to estimate the movements of hybrid offspring in species that form hybrid zones. Here, we use stable hydrogen to estimate the wintering locations and migratory patterns of two common and widespread migratory birds, Audubon's (Setophaga auduboni) and myrtle (S. coronata) warblers, as well as their hybrids. These two species form a narrow hybrid zone with extensive interbreeding in the Rocky Mountains of British Columbia and Alberta, Canada, which has been studied for over four decades. Isotopes in feathers grown on the wintering grounds or early on migration reveal three important patterns: (1) Audubon's and myrtle warblers from allopatric breeding populations winter in isotopically different environments, consistent with band recovery data and suggesting that there is a narrow migratory transition between the two species, (2) most hybrids appear to overwinter in the south‐eastern USA, similar to where myrtle warblers are known to winter, and (3) some hybrid individuals, particularly those along the western edge of the hybrid zone, show Audubon's‐like isotopic patterns. These data suggest there is a migratory divide between these two species, but that it is not directly coincident with the centre of the hybrid zone in the breeding range. We interpret these findings and discuss them within the context of previous research on hybrid zones, speciation and migratory divides.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMyrtus communis 3aSetophaga 3abirds 3abreeding 3afeathers 3ahybrids 3ahydrogen 3amigratory behavior 3areproductive isolation 3aseasonal variation 3astable isotopes 3awinter 3aAlberta 3aBritish Columbia 3aRocky Mountain region 3aUnited States1 aBrelsford, A.1 aIrwin, D.

Prevailing neoliberal and efficiency-based mindsets tend to focus on avoiding risk and creating “fail-safe” systems. In the last decade, resilience thinking has emerged as a means to transition from risk-averse, and command-and-control governance approaches towards those that are more adaptive, innovative and collaborative. To examine the practical usefulness of a resilience thinking approach, we used a complex, multi-layered case study of Tasmanian coastal governance. Drawing on the diverse expertise and a variety of key governance actors, we identified crucial problems being experienced with the Tasmanian coastal governance regime and discussed potential contributions of resilience thinking to address them. Thematic analysis of the results revealed three major contributions: resilience thinking (1) provides a way to think about change and uncertainty; (2) is compatible with proactive and entrepreneurial leadership; and (3) effectively considers issues of scale in the decision-making process. We conclude by offering practical suggestions towards devolved leadership and improved cross-scale collaboration, and consider the possibility of a hybrid resilience and risk-based approach to coastal management and governance.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase studies 3acoastal zone management 3adecision making 3aentrepreneurship 3aenvironmental governance 3aleadership 3arisk 3auncertainty 3aAustralia 0aCoastal governance 0aResilience thinking 0aDecision-making 0aSocial-ecological systems 0aRisk management 0aEntrepreneurial leadership1 aMitchell, Michael1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1082-30731 aClément, Sarah,1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5422-622X0 tJournal of environmental management.g2020 Jan. 01, v. 253 p.109662-dElsevier LtdwJournal:2018x0301-47977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2019.1096623Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03011naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100004100142245006400183300002000247520102700267592002801294596007501322596007501397596008101472596008101553596008101634596008401715596008401799650000801883650001401891650002001905650001301925650002301938700002501961700001901986700005302005700001502058700001902073700005602092700002402148700005902172700007402231773015002305856007702455852000902532655001202541IND60793374420221121154118.0220914e20220905xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079337442DNAL7 a10.1021/jacs.2c057262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKankanamalage, Dilanka V.

Walpita10aDNA Strand Displacement Driven by Host–Guest Interactions  ap. 16502-16511.  aBase-pair-driven toehold-mediated strand displacement (BP-TMSD) is a fundamental concept employed for constructing DNA machines and networks with a gamut of applications─from theranostics to computational devices. To broaden the toolbox of dynamic DNA chemistry, herein, we introduce a synthetic surrogate termed host–guest-driven toehold-mediated strand displacement (HG-TMSD) that utilizes bioorthogonal, cucurbit[7]uril (CB[7]) interactions with guest-linked input sequences. Since control of the strand-displacement process is salient, we demonstrate how HG-TMSD can be finely modulated via changes to the structure of the input sequence (including synthetic guest head-group and/or linker length). Further, for a given input sequence, competing small-molecule guests can serve as effective regulators (with fine and coarse control) of HG-TMSD. To show integration into functional devices, we have incorporated HG-TMSD into machines that control enzyme activity and layered reactions that detect specific microRNA.  aPublisher supplied data  aCHEc, National Science Foundationdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100000001  aCHEc, National Science Foundationdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100000001  aCHE-1807486cNational Science Foundationdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100000001  aCHE-2003879cNational Science Foundationdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100000001  aCHE-2100898cNational Science Foundationdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100000001  a1S10OD020117cNational Institutes of Healthdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100000002  a5RL5GM118966cNational Institutes of Healthdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100000002 3aDNA 3achemistry 3aenzyme activity 3amicroRNA 3aprecision medicine1 aTran, Jennifer H.

The batteries comprise high content of valuable metals including lithium, cobalt, nickel, and manganese; hence, their recycling is imperative. This study develops a supercritical fluid extraction process using supercritical CO₂ solvent with tributyl phosphate–nitric acid and hydrogen peroxide adduct to recover the four metals from the LIBs of electric vehicles. A full factorial design of experiment is utilized to determine the effect of temperature, pressure and adduct to solid ratio on the extraction. The extraction is optimized using empirical models, leading to 90% metal extraction. The addition of hydrogen peroxide improves the extraction by reducing metals to more soluble forms in supercritical CO₂. A systematic investigation is performed to elucidate the process mechanism. The developed process can help management of end-of-life LIBs, conserve of natural resources, and promote the circular economy.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon dioxide 3acircular economy 3acobalt 3aelectric vehicles 3ahydrogen peroxide 3alithium 3alithium batteries 3amanganese 3anickel 3asolvents 3asupercritical fluid extraction 3atemperature 0aSupercritical fluid extraction 0asupercritical carbon dioxide 0arecycling 0alithium-ion battery 0alithium 0acobalt1 aAzimi, Gisele0 tResources, conservation, and recycling.g2022 Dec., v. 187 p.106628-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11928x0921-34497nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.resconrec.2022.1066283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01742naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245008900170300001600259520057900275592002800854650001000882650001300892650001300905650002200918653002200940653003700962653002500999653003301024653005601057653001601113700001901129700001901148700001901167773008801186856008501274852000901359655001201368IND60529706220221117191007.0160723e201602  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052970622DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tibtech.2015.12.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTeotia, Sachin10aEssential RNA-Based Technologies and Their Applications in Plant Functional Genomics  ap. 106-123.  aGenome sequencing has not only extended our understanding of the blueprints of many plant species but has also revealed the secrets of coding and non-coding genes.

Initially, the transferrin receptor antibody (TfR Ab) functionalized Fe₃O₄@ZnO nanocomposites, followed by loading with doxorubicin (Dox) and denoted as Fe₃O₄@ZnO/Dox/TfR Ab, were prepared as an all-in-one system allowing for a targeted drug delivery with simultaneous concurrent chemoradiotherapy and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) monitoring. The diagnostic and therapeutic functionalities for HCC were evaluated in vitro and in a murine orthotopic models using cell viability assays, cell cycle tests, histopathological examinations, and serum biochemistry tests. The results demonstrated that Fe₃O₄@ZnO/Dox/TfR Ab could deliver Dox into the targeted HCC SMMC-7721 cells to enhance its chemotherapeutic efficiency. Besides, with the addition of short term and low dose X-ray illumination, the Fe₃O₄@ZnO nanocomposites showed excellent radiosensitizer properties, further attacking the cancer cells. Tumor cells were also mostly arrested at G2/M, resulting in a distinct inhibition of cell proliferation. In vivo, after the treatment, a noninvasive visualization monitoring through MRI showed that tumor growth was significantly suppressed by the targeted chemoradiotherapy mediated by Fe₃O₄@ZnO/Dox/TfR Ab. Therefore, Fe₃O₄@ZnO nanocomposites could mediate the theranostic strategy for hepatocellular carcinoma.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-radiation 3aantibodies 3ablood chemistry 3acell cycle 3acell proliferation 3acell viability 3adoxorubicin 3adrug therapy 3ahepatoma 3ahistopathology 3alighting 3amagnetic resonance imaging 3amice 3amodels 3amonitoring 3ananocomposites 3aneoplasm cells 3aprecision medicine 3atransferrin receptors 3aviability assays1 aPatel, Nishant1 aDing, Shuang1 aXiong, Jian1 aWu, Pingping0 tBiomaterials science.g2016 Jan. 26, v. 4, no. 2 p.288-298dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26911x2047-48497nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c5bm00361j3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02934naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002000140245016200160300002000322520143500342592002801777650001601805650001301821650002601834650002101860650001501881650001701896650001601913650001101929650001901940650001201959650002201971650002201993650002002015650002002035700001802055700002002073700002502093700002302118700002202141700002002163700001702183700002502200773014402225856007402369852000902443655001202452IND60642613820221119101248.0190507e20171031xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064261382DNAL7 a10.1039/c7ta05134d2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDas, Amit Kumar10aFabrication of an advanced asymmetric supercapacitor based on a microcubical PB@MnO₂ hybrid and PANI/GNP composite with excellent electrochemical behaviour  ap. 22242-22254.  aMetal Organic Framework (MOF) based supercapacitors are one of the best energy storage devices for future portable electronics. In this study, we report in detail the design and low-cost fabrication of an advanced asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) which was assembled with a Prussian blue (PB)/MnO₂ (PB@MnO₂) hybrid as the positive electrode and a polyaniline (PANI)/graphene nanoplatelet (GNP) (PG) composite as the negative electrode with aq. KNO₃ electrolyte. Both the electrodes were made by the coating of the respective electrode materials on conducting stainless steel (SS) fabric. The MOF based positive electrode material, i.e., the PB@MnO₂ hybrid was synthesized via reducing agent assisted chemical bath deposition of MnO₂ nanolayers on faradaic PB microcubes and showed an appreciable specific capacitance (Cₛₚ) of 608 F g⁻¹ at 1 A g⁻¹ current density in the three-electrode measurement and the assembled PB@MnO₂//PG ASC device manifests favourable Cₛₚ of 98 F g⁻¹ at 1 A g⁻¹. Moreover, this ASC device exhibits significant energy density of 16.5 W h Kg⁻¹ at the power density of 550 W Kg⁻¹ along with notable long-term cycling stability (retention of 93% capacitance even after 4000 cycles of charging and discharging). Thus, the obtained results reflect the great potential of the ASC device for exploring state-of-art futuristic applications as an advanced energy storage system.  aPublisher supplied data 3acapacitance 3acoatings 3acoordination polymers 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3aelectrolytes 3aelectronics 3aenergy 3aenergy density 3afabrics 3amanganese dioxide 3apotassium nitrate 3areducing agents 3astainless steel1 aBera, Ranadip1 aMaitra, Anirban1 aKaran, Sumanta Kumar1 aParia, Sarbaranjan1 aHalder, Lopamudra1 aSi, Suman Kumar1 aBera, Aswini1 aKhatua, Bhanu Bhusan0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2017 Oct. 31, v. 5, no. 42 p.22242-22254dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c7ta05134d3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03134naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100005100147245016000198520128000358592002801638650001701666650002101683650003201704650001401736650002301750650001901773650002501792650002601817650002001843650001601863650001401879650001301893650001101906650002901917650001501946650002301961650002101984650002402005650000702029650002102036650001102057650001302068650002302081650001602104650001202120650000902132653001102141653002102152653002102173653002602194653002502220700001802245700005702263773012202320856008102442852000902523655001202532IND60670263520221120213329.0200121e202001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067026352DNAL7 a10.1016/j.lwt.2019.1086922doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCao, Xi1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1441-841910aPurification and characterization of an extracellular lipase from Trichosporon sp. and its application in enrichment of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids  aLipase catalysis has become the most promising technique for enrichment of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) due to its mild and green conditions. In this study, Trichosporon sp. F1-2 was newly isolated from oil-contaminated sludge, and its extracellular lipase was purified using ammonium sulfate precipitation and DEAE-Sepharose chromatography. The molecular weight of the lipase was estimated to be 32.6 kDa. The optimal temperature and pH for lipase activity were 50 °C and 8.0, respectively, and the optimal storage conditions were found to be temperatures below 45 °C and pH 7.0–9.0. The lipase did not require metal ions as cofactors and was significantly inhibited by Zn²⁺. It was stable in various organic solvents with different log P values, and n-hexane, toluene, dichloromethane, diethyl ether and glycerol even enhanced its activity. It had sn-1,3 regioselectivity and the highest activity towards a medium-chain fatty acid (C8) ester. This study demonstrated the lipase has good potential as a catalyst in enrichment of EPA and DHA in fish oil. The content of EPA and DHA reached 22.9 and 25.4 mol%, respectively, using 100 U of the lipase within 24 h, and the enrichment efficiency of DHA was higher than that of EPA.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTrichosporon 3aammonium sulfate 3acarboxylic ester hydrolases 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3achromatography 3adocosahexaenoic acid 3aeicosapentaenoic acid 3aenzyme activity 3aethyl ether 3afish oils 3aglycerol 3ahexane 3amedium chain fatty acids 3ametal ions 3amethylene chloride 3amolecular weight 3aomega-3 fatty acids 3apH 3aregioselectivity 3asludge 3asolvents 3astorage conditions 3atemperature 3atoluene 3azinc 0aLipase 0aTrichosporon sp. 0aCharacterization 0aEicosapentaenoic acid 0aDocosahexaenoic acid1 aLiao, Linmeng1 aFeng, Fengqin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5528-93100 tLebensmittel-Wissenschaft + Technologie.g2020 Jan., v. 118 p.108692-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl1644x0023-64387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lwt.2019.1086923Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03663naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100007200139245012400211300001600335500001900351500001100370520189200381592002802273596004202301596002702343596002602370596009102396596003402487650001502521650002102536650002302557650002502580650002002605650001502625650001202640650001502652650002002667650001502687651001402702700006002716700006502776700006102841700006102902773013602963856007303099852000903172655001203181IND60714446420221121052913.0201024e202011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071444642DNAL7 a10.1111/afe.124022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDittrich‐Schröder, Gudrun1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5700-627610aInvasive gall‐forming wasps that threaten non‐native plantation‐grown Eucalyptus: diversity and invasion patterns  ap. 285-297.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aREVIEW  aGall‐forming hymenopterans of Eucalyptus species are highly successful invaders causing significant damage in non‐native plantation forests. To date, at least 16 of these species have been recorded as invasive eucalypt gall formers, of which less than half are known from Australia where they are thought to be native. About 80% of the species have become invasive only in the last two decades, <10%, of which were known from Australia beforehand. Two species, Leptocybe invasa and Ophelimus maskelli are global invaders that have become established in 43 and 23 countries, respectively, since 2000. They belong to a large number of wasps that cause similar damage and that could become invasive in the future. The problem of identification is exacerbated by the fact that many species lack taxonomic descriptions; over 80% of the invasive eucalypt gall wasps were first described from their invasive range. The small number of taxonomists able to identify these insects slows accurate diagnoses. Even when initial identifications have been made, these may be confused with morphologically similar but distinct cryptic species, which may differ in their host range and natural enemy interactions. Furthermore, detailed information regarding their biology and native distribution is typically sparse or unknown. This lack of information delays the initiation of management actions because breeding for resistance and biological control requires accurate identification of the target pest. The gall‐forming hymenopterans associated with Eucalyptus represent an important group on which to focus the development of pre‐emptive quarantine, monitoring and potential management options. Given the global nature of invasions by these insects, an international and collaborative research approach is required, where knowledge and tools for study can be shared in a more effective manner.  aPublisher supplied data  cNational Sirex Coordination Committee  cPlant Health Australia  cHQPlantations Pty Ltd  cQueensland Department of Agriculture and Fisheries, Forest and Wood Products Australia  cAdvance Queensland Fellowship 3aEucalyptus 3aLeptocybe invasa 3abiological control 3acooperative research 3acryptic species 3aentomology 3aforests 3ahost range 3anatural enemies 3aquarantine 3aAustralia1 aHurley, Brett P.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8702-55471 aWingfield, Michael J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9346-20091 aNahrung, Helen F.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3351-306X1 aSlippers, Bernard1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1491-38580 tAgricultural and forest entomology.g2020 Nov., v. 22, no. 4 p.285-297dBlackwell Publishing LtdwJournal:jnl58336x1461-95557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/afe.124023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02196naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001900149245007700168300001300245520103900258592002801297650001001325650001501335650001401350650001801364650001201382650001701394650002001411650001801431650001301449650001601462653002501478653002901503653002801532700001901560700002401579773010301603856008301706852000901789655001201798IND60592946620221120120736.0180413e20180401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059294662DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ydbio.2018.01.0192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHan, Albert Y.10aMolecular specification of facial branchial motor neurons in vertebrates  ap. 5-13.  aOrofacial muscles are critical for life-sustaining behaviors, such as feeding and breathing. Centuries of work by neuroanatomists and surgeons resulted in the mapping of bulbar motor neurons in the brainstem and the course of the cranial nerves that carry their axons. Despite the sophisticated understanding of the anatomy of the region, the molecular mechanisms that dictate the development and maturation of facial motor neurons remain poorly understood. This fundamental problem has been recently revisited by physiologists with novel techniques of studying the rhythmic contraction of orofacial muscles in relationship to breathing. The molecular understanding of facial motor neuron development will not only lead to the comprehension of the neural basis of facial expression but may also unlock new avenues to generate stem cell-derived replacements. This review summarizes the current understanding of molecular programs involved in facial motor neuron generation, migration, and maturation, including neural circuit assembly.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaxons 3abrain stem 3abreathing 3amotor neurons 3amuscles 3anerve tissue 3aneural networks 3aphysiologists 3asurgeons 3avertebrates 0aEmbryonic patterning 0aMotor neuron development 0aOrofacial motor neurons1 aGupta, Sandeep1 aNovitch, Bennett G.0 tDevelopmental biology.g2018 Apr. 01, v. 436 p.5-13dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12382x0012-16067nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ydbio.2018.01.0193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02516naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001300140245011100153300002000264520123800284592002801522650001101550650001401561650001401575650001701589650001201606650001701618650002401635650003301659650001101692650001901703650002001722700001701742700001701759700001501776700001401791700001701805700001801822700001501840773014401855856007401999852000902073655001202082IND60642614020221119101417.0190507e20170829xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064261402DNAL7 a10.1039/c7ta05145j2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGao, Shu10aPoly(vinylidene fluoride)-based hybrid gel polymer electrolytes for additive-free lithium sulfur batteries  ap. 17889-17895.  aThe permeation of dissolved lithium polysulfides across the porous polyolefin-based commercial separator is a major hindrance for using lithium sulfur batteries (LSBs). In this work, the poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF)-based gel polymer electrolyte (GPE) with a compact morphology to block polysulfide penetration is prepared using a simple solution-casting method, and the strategy of incorporating poly(ethylene oxide) and nano zirconium dioxide is applied to guarantee electrolyte uptake and Li⁺ mobility. Superior to the commercial separator with liquid electrolyte, the LSB assembled with additive-free GPE exhibits a high initial capacity of 1429 mA h g⁻¹, coulombic efficiency of 96% at 0.2C and improved rate performance. After 500 cycles at 1C, the LSB could still deliver a capacity of 847.2 mA h g⁻¹, with a low fading rate of 0.05%. The LSB with high sulfur loading (5.2 mg cm⁻²) could attain a high areal capacity of 4.6 mA h cm⁻². Results of scanning electron microscopy suggest that such a hybrid GPE could effectively protect the lithium anode from polysulfide corrosion. Therefore, this novel membrane of hybrid PVDF-based GPE provides a simple and effective method to establish high-performance LSBs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanodes 3abatteries 3acorrosion 3aelectrolytes 3alithium 3apermeability 3apolyethylene glycol 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asulfur 3athermoplastics 3azirconium oxide1 aWang, Kangli1 aWang, Ruxing1 aJiang, Mao1 aHan, Jing1 aGu, Tiantian1 aCheng, Shijie1 aJiang, Kai0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2017 Aug. 29, v. 5, no. 34 p.17889-17895dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c7ta05145j3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03103naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100006000147245014300207506010400350506007600454520143800530592002801968506003701996650001402033650002502047650000902072650001402081650001402095650001802109650001002127650003302137650001402170650001002184650001302194650002202207653002602229653001402255653001302269653001002282653001402292700006102306700001702367700002202384773012402406856008202530852000902612655001202621IND60773025320221207064441.0220426e20220501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077302532DNAL7 a10.1016/j.lwt.2022.1134222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSinkovič, Lovro1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6123-808510aMacro/microelements, nutrients and bioactive components in common and Tartary buckwheat (Fagopyrum spp.) grain and stone-milling fractions  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe study aimed to determine variations in macro/microelements, nutrients and bioactive components in grain and stone-milled fractions of common and Tartary buckwheat cultivated over three consecutive years. Whole grain were milled to obtain several fractions: light flour, semolina, three or four bran fractions, and hulls. Dry matter, crude protein, crude fat, macro- and microelements, total antioxidant capacity, rutin and quercetin contents, and compounds with antioxidative potential were determined. Crude protein in buckwheat samples ranged from 2.9% to 35.7%, and crude fat from 0.2% to 10.1%. Bioactive compounds were significantly higher in Tartary buckwheat samples, especially for semolina and bran fractions. The multi-elemental compositions of these buckwheat species were comparable, while the differences between the milling fractions varied considerably for K, P, Mg, S, Fe and Zn. Principal component analysis for 20 parameters derived from 45 samples showed good discrimination for buckwheat whole grain, light flour and hulls for both species, for Tartary buckwheat bran and semolina, and for common buckwheat bran and semolina. The profiles of compounds with antioxidant potential were significantly different between the buckwheat species, as well as for hulls and bran fractions compared with the other fractions. In general, harvest year did not have any significant impact on any of the parameters analysed.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aFagopyrum 3aantioxidant activity 3abran 3abuckwheat 3acrude fat 3acrude protein 3aflour 3aprincipal component analysis 3aquercetin 3arutin 3asemolina 3awhole grain foods 0aBuckwheat composition 0aNutrients 0aElements 0aRutin 0aQuercetin1 aDeželak, Matjaž1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9298-45821 aKopinč, Rok1 aMeglič, Vladimir0 tLebensmittel-Wissenschaft + Technologie.g2022 May 01, v. 161 p.113422-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl1644x0023-64387nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lwt.2022.1134223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03427naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245016900170300001400339520173400353592002802087650001102115650002402126650002002150650001202170650001502182650001602197650003302213650001802246650001102264650001102275650001702286650003202303650001002335650002502345650002302370651001002393651001802403653002502421653002602446653001702472653002002489700001402509700001802523700001402541700001802555700001902573700001302592700001202605700002302617700001302640773010102653856008602754852000902840655001202849IND60537852920221121003824.0190408e201401  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053785292DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecoleng.2013.10.0202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLin, Yong-ming14aThe succession characteristics of soil erosion during different vegetation succession stages in dry-hot river valley of Jinsha River, upper reaches of Yangtze River  ap. 13-26.  aDeclining vegetation coverage caused by serious soil erosion in dry-hot river valley of the Jinsha River has resulted in a vicious cycle of environmental deterioration and aggravated soil erosion. In order to identify the relationship between vegetation succession and transformation of soil erosion, the methods of “space replacing time” and 137Cs technique have been used to analyze community structure of vegetation and distribution characteristics of 137Cs contents in the slopes and vegetation units of five succession stages, which included native grassland, shrub, sapling forest, half-mature forest and near mature forest in Jiangjiagou gully, Dongchuan city, Yunnan province. We found, during the course of succession, the number of species in communities increased with vegetation development and succession, but the 137Cs loss decreased with vegetation succession. Following the succession, near mature forest had the highest 137Cs inventory and native grassland had the lowest 137Cs inventory in both slopes and vegetation units. Principal component analysis showed that 137Cs inventory was significantly positively correlated with average crown diameter of tree (ACDT), species number, tree coverage and average tree height. Average crown diameter of shrub (ACDS) and average shrub height were also positively related to 137Cs inventory but to a lesser extent. Based on the results of our study, we illustrated the improvement of soil erosion control through soil conservation and water regulation with vegetation succession. Consequently, the results suggest that community features significantly affect soil erosion, through which we can evaluate and predict the soil erosion intensity of different vegetation.  aPublisher supplied data 3acesium 3acommunity structure 3aerosion control 3aforests 3agrasslands 3ainventories 3aprincipal component analysis 3aradionuclides 3arivers 3ashrubs 3asoil erosion 3atree and stand measurements 3atrees 3avegetation structure 3awater conservation 3aChina 3aYangtze River 0aDry-hot river valley 0aVegetation succession 0aSoil erosion 0a137Cs technique1 aCui, Peng1 aGe, Yong-gang1 aChen, Can1 aWang, Dao-jie1 aWu, Cheng-zhen1 aLi, Jian1 aYu, Wei1 aZhang, Guang-shuai1 aLin, Han0 tEcological engineering.g2014 Jan., v. 62 p.13-26dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11630x0925-85747nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoleng.2013.10.0203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03397naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094024002200131024001900153040001800172100001400190245010400204300001400308506007600322520148100398592002801879506003701907650003101944650001501975650002501990650001002015650003002025650001902055650001302074650000902087650003702096650001202133650001302145650002002158650001102178650002402189650002902213653002602242653001602268653002302284653001302307653002802320653001002348653002402358653001802382653002802400653002002428700001802448700001502466700002402481700002002505700002102525700001702546773010402563856008302667852000902750655001202759IND60592946720221207133737.0180413e20180401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059294672DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ydbio.2018.02.0072doi7 aPMC59126982pmcid7 a294547062pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMeng, Yue10aGATA6 phosphorylation by Erk1/2 propels exit from pluripotency and commitment to primitive endoderm  ap. 55-65.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe transcription factor GATA6 and the Fgf/Ras/MAPK signaling pathway are essential for the development of the primitive endoderm (PrE), one of the two lineages derived from the pluripotent inner cell mass (ICM) of mammalian blastocysts. A mutant mouse line in which Gata6-coding exons are replaced with H2BGFP (histone H2B Green Fluorescence Protein fusion protein) was developed to monitor Gata6 promoter activity. In the Gata6-H2BGFP heterozygous blastocysts, the ICM cells that initially had uniform GFP fluorescence signal at E3.5 diverged into two populations by the 64-cell stage, either as the GFP-high PrE or the GFP-low epiblasts (Epi). However in the GATA6-null blastocysts, the originally moderate GFP expression subsided in all ICM cells, indicating that the GATA6 protein is required to maintain its own promoter activity during PrE linage commitment. In embryonic stem cells, expressed GATA6 was shown to bind and activate the Gata6 promoter in PrE differentiation. Mutations of a conserved serine residue (S264) for Erk1/2 phosphorylation in GATA6 protein drastically impacted its ability to activate its own promoter. We conclude that phosphorylation of GATA6 by Erk1/2 compels exit from pluripotent state, and the phosphorylation propels a GATA6 positive feedback regulatory circuit to compel PrE differentiation. Our findings resolve the longstanding question on the dual requirements of GATA6 and Ras/MAPK pathway for PrE commitment of the pluripotent ICM.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aGATA transcription factors 3ablastocyst 3aembryonic stem cells 3aexons 3agreen fluorescent protein 3aheterozygosity 3ahistones 3amice 3amitogen-activated protein kinase 3amutants 3amutation 3aphosphorylation 3aserine 3asignal transduction 3atranscription (genetics) 0aEmbryonic development 0aBlastocysts 0aPrimitive endoderm 0aEpiblast 0aLineage differentiation 0aGATA6 0aPromoter activation 0aTranscription 0aRas/MAPK signal pathway 0aPhosphorylation1 aMoore, Robert1 aTao, Wensi1 aSmith, Elizabeth R.1 aTse, Jeffrey D.1 aCaslini, Corrado1 aXu, Xiang-Xi0 tDevelopmental biology.g2018 Apr. 01, v. 436 p.55-65dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12382x0012-16067nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ydbio.2018.02.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03536naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245018600167500002200353506011700375506007600492520153500568583033502103592002802438506003702466650002702503650002102530650002802551650003402579650001602613650001702629650001202646650002002658650002402678650001402702650001202716650001602728650001802744650000902762650001202771650001502783651001002798653000902808653001802817700001902835773011902854856004802973852000903021655001203030IND60773025520221207065125.0220411e20220401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077302552DNAL7 a10.1016/j.lwt.2022.1134242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMaruta, Hiroshi10aRETRACTED: Lactobacillus and other probiotic bacteria: Their anti-melanogenicity and longevity promoting activities are closely linked through the major ‘pathogenic’ kinase PAK1  aPre-press version  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aPAK1-deficient mutant of Caenorhabditis elegans lives 60% longer than the wild-type. Interestingly, PAK1-deficient mutant of melanocytes produces less melanin (only a half compared with the wild-type) in the presence of either serum (PDGF) or α-MSH (alpha-melanocyte stimulating hormone). These observations clearly indicate that the major “pathogenic” kinase PAK1 is responsible for both shortening the healthy lifespan, and PDGF/α-MSH-dependent melanogenesis. For screening of PAK1-blocking probiotic bacteria or their products, their anti-melanogenic as well as longevity promoting properties were examined. Recently it was found that C. elegans fed with Lactobacillus rhamnosus in Xinjiang cheese lives 40% longer than the worm fed with the standard Escherichia coli. Interestingly, a Chinese traditional medicine called “ChiBai” fermented with the L. rhamnosus also inhibited the α-MSH-induced melanogenesis, and this bacteria itself produces butyric acid that blocks the oncogenic HDAC (histone deacetylase)-PAK1 signaling pathway. These findings strongly suggest, if not proven, that anti-melanogenic activity of Lactobacillus and many other probiotic bacteria could serve as a reliable indicator for their longevity promoting activity. In this context, a popular Japanese Lactobacillus-fermented milk drink called “Calpis”, developed a century ago, and recently proven to inhibit the melanogenesis by suppressing the PAK1-dependent Tyrosinase gene expression, could potentially prolong our healthy lifespan.  aRetracted: 2022, p.113424, 10.1016/j.lwt.2022.113424zThis article has been withdrawn at the request of the author(s) and/or editor.

However, little information is currently available concerning the influence of MPs derived from PCF (PCF-MPs) on the crop-soil system. Therefore, we investigated the impacts of PCF-MPs (0, 0.01, 0.1, 1% w/w) on the growth of maize cultivars (ZNT 488 & ZTN 182), rhizosphere metabolites, microbial community, and soil properties. The effects of PCF-MPs on plant growth varied with plant cultivars and exposure doses. MPs had no influence on the growth of ZNT 488, but significantly improved the plant performance of ZTN 182 at higher doses. PCF-MPs insignificantly altered the rhizosphere metabolite profile of two maize cultivars. Although soil PAEs contents and the microbial communities were unchanged, the phyla Fibrobacteres and Verrucomicrobia (associated with plant growth-promotion) were increased significantly in ZTN 182. Moreover, PCF-MPs stimulated the soil urease, acid phosphatase and nitrate reductase activities, especially the phytase activity in ZTN 182. Besides, significant alterations in soil properties were also discovered in a cultivar-dependent manner. Overall, our study highlighted that the potential environmental risk assessment of PCF-MPs is still needed, even though PCF-MPs did not show negative effect on maize growth and rhizosphere metabolic profiles.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFibrobacteres 3aVerrucomicrobia 3aacid phosphatase 3acorn 3acultivars 3aenvironmental assessment 3afertilizers 3agrowth promotion 3ametabolites 3amicrobial communities 3amicroplastics 3anitrate reductase 3aphytases 3aplant growth 3apollution 3arhizosphere 3aurease 0aMicroplastic pollution 0aZea mays 0aPolymer 0aFertilizer 0aSoil-plant system1 aLiu, Weitao1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1352-02431 aMeng, Lingzuo1 aWu, Jiani1 aZeb, Aurang1 aCheng, Liping1 aLian, Yuhang1 aSun, Hongwen0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2021 Oct. 10, v. 318 p.128571-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2021.1285713Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02556naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003000092040001800122100002500140245011600165300001800281500000900299520146500308592002801773650001501801650002001816650001901836650001501855650002901870650001601899650001501915700002101930700001801951700002001969773013101989852000902120856007702129655001202206IND4447132120221122031932.0191228e201011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444713212DNAL7 a10.2136/vzj2009.01652doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKoyama, Christian N.10aVariability of Surface Soil Moisture Observed from Multitemporal C-Band Synthetic Aperture Radar and Field Data  ap. 1014-1024.  aepub  aThe study aimed to analyze the spatial variability of surface soil moisture at different spatial scales based on field measurements and remote sensing estimates. Multitemporal Envisat satellite Advanced Synthetic Aperture Radar (ASAR) data were used to derive the surface soil moisture utilizing an empirical C-band retrieval algorithm. Eight wide-swath (WS) images with a spatial resolution of 150 m acquired between February and October 2008 were used to determine the surface soil moisture contents. The accuracy of the surface soil moisture retrievals was evaluated by comparison with in situ measurements. This comparison yielded a root mean square error of 5% (v/v). Based on our in situ measurements as well as remote sensing results, the relationship of the coefficient of variation of the spatial soil moisture patterns and the mean soil moisture was analyzed at different spatial scales ranging from the catchment scale to the field scale. Our results show that the coefficient of variation decreases at all scales with increasing soil moisture. The gain of this relationship decreases with scale, however, indicating that at a given soil moisture state, the spatial variation at the large scale of whole catchments is larger than at the field scale. Knowledge of the spatial variability of the surface soil moisture is important to better understand energy exchange processes and water fluxes at the land surface as well as their scaling properties.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3aenergy transfer 3aremote sensing 3asoil water 3asynthetic aperture radar 3avadose zone 3awatersheds1 aKorres, Wolfgang1 aFiener, Peter1 aSchneider, Karl0 tVadose zone journal.g2010 Nov., v. 9, no. 4 p.1014-1024dSoil Science Society of AmericawJournal:jnl3674032x1539-16637nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2136/vzj2009.01653Available from publisher's site 7aarticle02917naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002900139245011600168300001600284500001900300500002000319520128500339592002801624596005301652596005001705596003201755596005101787596000901838596003101847596001501878650002101893650001801914650001101932650001501943650001101958650001201969650001301981650003001994650001102024650001002035650001402045650001502059650002302074650002302097650001002120700002202130700001702152773013602169856007302305852000902378655001202387IND60714446720221121084721.0201024e202011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071444672DNAL7 a10.1111/afe.123942doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJahant‐Miller, Chelsea10aSpatial and temporal changes in male gypsy moth wing morphology reflect host tree phenology and habitat quality  ap. 390-400.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe size of adult gypsy moths, (Lymantria dispar L.), a capitalbreeder, is correlated with environmental conditions experienced as larvae. Proxies for adult size such as wing length may provide information about habitat quality and population density. We used male gypsy moths collected from pheromone traps at intervals through the flight season to assess phenological change in wing length. Consistent with a previous study conducted at our reference site, we found that wing length declines seasonally, likely resulting from phenological reduction in host foliage quality. This pattern was evident at our reference site over 8 years, and at our experimental sites with low‐density populations in 3 years. We assessed forest quality using two unique metrics, basal area of red oak (Quercus rubra), a high quality host tree, and a composite value generated from a published ranking of tree species quality for gypsy moth. We did not find a relationship between these metrics and wing length, although we found that the mean size of males was larger in stands with oak. Mean wing length in outbreak populations was significantly smaller reflecting density related processes such as intraspecific competition, although there was no significant seasonal effect on wing length.  aPublisher supplied data  aDEB‐1556111cDivision of Environmental Biology  a11‐JV‐11242303‐053cU.S. Forest Service  cNational Science Foundation  cUSDA Forest Service, Northern Research Station  cUSDA  cUniversity of Rhode Island  cUSDA APHIS 3aLymantria dispar 3aQuercus rubra 3aadults 3aentomology 3aflight 3aforests 3ahabitats 3aintraspecific competition 3aleaves 3amales 3aphenology 3apheromones 3apopulation density 3aseasonal variation 3atrees1 aTobin, Patrick C.1 aParry, Dylan0 tAgricultural and forest entomology.g2020 Nov., v. 22, no. 4 p.390-400dBlackwell Publishing LtdwJournal:jnl58336x1461-95557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/afe.123943Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02748naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003000092040001800122100002100140245011400161300001800275500000900293520150700302592002801809650001701837650002001854650001901874650001601893650002301909650001501932650000901947650001501956650002501971650001601996700002402012700002302036700002102059700002102080700002002101773013102121852000902252856007702261655001202338IND4447132220221122031921.0191228e201011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444713222DNAL7 a10.2136/vzj2009.01582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWohlfahrt, Georg10aInsights from Independent Evapotranspiration Estimates for Closing the Energy Balance: A Grassland Case Study  ap. 1025-1033.  aepub  aWhen using the eddy covariance (EC) method for measuring the ecosystem–atmosphere exchange of sensible and latent heat, it is not uncommon to find that these two energy fluxes fall short of the available energy by 20 to 30%. As the causes for the energy imbalance are still under discussion, it is currently not clear how the energy balance should be closed. The objective of this study was to use independent measurements of evapotranspiration (ET) for empirically devising how to best close the energy balance. To this end, the ET of a temperate mountain grassland was quantified during two measurement campaigns using both an open- and a closed-path EC system, lysimeters, and an approach scaling up leaf-level stomatal conductance to canopy-level transpiration. Our study showed that both EC systems underestimated ET measured independently by lysimeters and the upscaling approach. The best correspondence with independently measured ET was achieved by assigning the entire energy imbalance to ET and by adjusting the ET according to the average energy balance ratio during the first and second measurement campaigns, respectively. Due to a large spatial variability in ET during the first measurement campaign and given large differences in spatial scale between the EC and the independent methods, we are more confident with the comparison of approaches during the second measurement campaign and thus recommend forcing energy balance closure by adjusting for the average energy balance ratio.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase studies 3aeddy covariance 3aenergy balance 3aenergy flow 3aevapotranspiration 3agrasslands 3aheat 3alysimeters 3astomatal conductance 3avadose zone1 aIrschick, Christoph1 aThalinger, Bettina1 aHörtnagl, Lukas1 aObojes, Nikolaus1 aHammerle, Albin0 tVadose zone journal.g2010 Nov., v. 9, no. 4 p.1025-1033dSoil Science Society of AmericawJournal:jnl3674032x1539-16637nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2136/vzj2009.01583Available from publisher's site 7aarticle02828naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100006300139245009700202300001600299500001900315500002000334520143200354592002801786596004501814596006701859596005101926650001901977650002101996650001002017650002102027650001102048650001502059650001202074650001502086650002602101700006102127773013602188856007302324961001202397852000902409655001202418IND60714446820221121084730.0201024e202011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071444682DNAL7 a10.1111/afe.123822doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMayfield, Albert E.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2277-678510aDifferential sunlight exposure affects settling behaviour of hemlock woolly adelgid crawlers  ap. 309-318.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aPrevious research demonstrated that elevated sunlight improves carbon balance and growth of eastern hemlock (Tsuga canadensis (L.) Carrière) seedlings infested with the invasive hemlock woolly adelgid (Adelges tsugae Annand). This study examined the hypothesis that elevated visible and ultraviolet sunlight directly affects the settling behaviour of A. tsugae crawlers. Hemlock seedlings were manually infested with equal densities of A. tsugae and placed into artificial shade treatments (0%, 40% and 80% shade). The density of settled nymphs of the ensuing generation on shaded seedlings was three times higher than the density on unshaded seedlings. Adelges tsugae ovisacs were also attached to hydrated hemlock branches placed beneath acrylic filter treatments that selectively allowed transmission of various sunlight wavelengths. The proportion of adelgid crawlers that settled on the branch (vs. dropping from it) was higher beneath filters that blocked the widest spectrum of solar radiation (opaque and amber filters) than beneath full sun. In the March‐April trial, exposure to full sun and the full visible spectrum only (clear‐UV filter) significantly increased the proportion of crawlers that settled on the bottom (vs. top) side of the branch. Our results suggest that A. tsugae crawlers are negatively phototactic and/or thermotactic, with behaviour influenced more by visible light than ultraviolet light.  aPublisher supplied data  cCamcore, North Carolina State University  cUSDA Forest Service, Forest Health Protection, Southern Region  cUSDA Forest Service, Southern Research Station 3aAdelges tsugae 3aTsuga canadensis 3aamber 3aartificial shade 3acarbon 3aentomology 3aforests 3aphototaxis 3aultraviolet radiation1 aJetton, Robert M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2839-44460 tAgricultural and forest entomology.g2020 Nov., v. 22, no. 4 p.309-318dBlackwell Publishing LtdwJournal:jnl58336x1461-95557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/afe.123823Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/FS  aDNAL 7aarticle02388naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001500140245010400155300002000259520118500279592002801464650001701492650001601509650002101525650001501546650002201561650001901583650001501602650001301617650002101630700001901651700001901670700001801689700001801707700001801725700001901743773014501762856007401907852000901981655001201990IND60642614520221119101504.0190507e20170912xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064261452DNAL7 a10.1039/c7ta05160c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJu, Peiwen10a3D walnut-shaped TiO₂/RGO/MoO₂@Mo electrode exhibiting extraordinary supercapacitor performance  ap. 18777-18785.  aRational architectural design is the key to improve specific capacitance. Herein, we present a facile one-step hydrothermal process for the fabrication of a TiO₂/RGO/MoO₂ composite with an unprecedented 3D walnut-shaped hierarchical nanostructure, in which amorphous TiO₂ is decorated on the RGO (reduced graphene oxide)/MoO₂ surface via a Mo-involved in situ growth route on Mo net (TiO₂/RGO/MoO₂@Mo). This 3D structure coated with ultrafine arched nanorods is a great breakthrough in electrochemical performances of TiO₂– or MoO₂-based electrodes as it exhibits an extraordinary areal capacitance of 3927 mF cm⁻² at 3 mA cm⁻² (i.e. 1636 F g⁻¹ at 1.25 A g⁻¹) with only 3.5% capacitance loss after 5000 cycles. Such an excellent performance is benefitted from the following factors: (i) amorphous TiO₂ sculptured MoO₂ blocky particles supply more active-site accessibility and facilitate the accommodation of volume expansion. (ii) Arched MoO₂ nanorods as well as the walnut-shaped spheres of the composite provide electron transfer paths. (iii) RGO is a soft scaffold, which relieves the volume expansion during the charge/discharge processes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactive sites 3acapacitance 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3aelectron transfer 3agraphene oxide 3amolybdenum 3ananorods 3atitanium dioxide1 aZhu, Zhaoqiang1 aShao, Xiaoxiao1 aWang, Shengqi1 aZhao, Chunhua1 aQian, Xiuzhen1 aZhao, Chongjun0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2017 Sept. 12, v. 5, no. 35 p.18777-18785dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c7ta05160c3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02944naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001800139245009700157300001400254500002000268520130800288592002801596650001901624650002201643650003301665650002801698650001001726650002001736650002201756650001601778650001001794650001101804650001301815650001101828650001501839650003001854650001801884650002001902650002501922700002101947700001701968700001801985700001802003700002202021700001602043700002102059700002102080700001802101700003702119700002102156700001402177773009302191856007302284852000902357655001202366IND60580549220221119160023.0170921e201710  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058054922DNAL7 a10.1111/tpj.136302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWai, Ching M.10aTemporal and spatial transcriptomic and microRNA dynamics of CAM photosynthesis in pineapple  ap. 19-30.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe altered carbon assimilation pathway of crassulacean acid metabolism (CAM) photosynthesis results in an up to 80% higher water‐use efficiency than C₃ photosynthesis in plants making it a potentially useful pathway for engineering crop plants with improved drought tolerance. Here we surveyed detailed temporal (diel time course) and spatial (across a leaf gradient) gene and microRNA (miRNA) expression patterns in the obligate CAM plant pineapple [Ananas comosus (L.) Merr.]. The high‐resolution transcriptome atlas allowed us to distinguish between CAM‐related and non‐CAM gene copies. A differential gene co‐expression network across green and white leaf diel datasets identified genes with circadian oscillation, CAM‐related functions, and source‐sink relations. Gene co‐expression clusters containing CAM pathway genes are enriched with clock‐associated cis‐elements, suggesting circadian regulation of CAM. About 20% of pineapple microRNAs have diel expression patterns, with several that target key CAM‐related genes. Expression and physiology data provide a model for CAM‐specific carbohydrate flux and long‐distance hexose transport.

Three oleaginous bacteria (i.e. DS-1, DS-6, and DS-7) were screened on the basis of their lipid accumulation (>20% lipid content) and productivity on a glucose-based medium. The effect of different carbon sources (i.e. lactose, sucrose, starch, glucose, and xylose) on lipid accumulation capacity of the bacterial isolates was evaluated. The rod-shaped oleaginous bacterium DS-7 could accumulate 90% lipid with 1.2 g/l·d lipid productivity using lactose as a sole source of carbon. The bacteria could efficiently utilize dairy wastewater (~50% reduction in BOD) with reasonably high lipid accumulation (72.78%), biomass production (4.29 g/l) and lipid productivity (0.727 g/l·d). The lipids accumulated by bacterium DS-7 were mostly neutral lipids and contained fatty acids of chain length C14:0-C18:0, as confirmed by nile red staining and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and gas chromatography (GC) analysis of fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) revealed that transesterified bacterial lipids from the isolated bacteria DS-7 are suitable for biodiesel applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3abacteria 3abiochemical oxygen demand 3abiodiesel 3abiomass production 3acarbon 3afatty acid methyl esters 3afatty acids 3afeedstocks 3afuel production 3agas chromatography 3aglucose 3alactose 3alipid content 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3astaining 3astarch 3asucrose 3atriacylglycerols 3awastewater 3axylose 0aDairy wastewater 0aBiodiesel 0aOleaginous bacteria 0aLipid productivity 0aRenewable feedstock1 aDutta, Kasturi1 aVerma, Priyanka1 aDaverey, Achlesh1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4480-01411 aSahoo, Deepak Kumar0 tJournal of environmental management.g2019 Dec. 15, v. 252 p.109686-dElsevier LtdwJournal:2018x0301-47977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2019.1096863Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02326naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002300145245013600168300001800304500001900322500002000341520090900361592002801270596005501298596005901353650002201412650002901434650001601463650001201479650001801491650001101509650002101520650001101541650001201552650001301564650001401577650002901591700006401620773013201684856007901816852000901895655001201904IND60714447220221121150138.0201024e202010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071444722DNAL7 a10.1111/1462-2920.151232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHubert, Cameron L.12aA universal oyster infection model demonstrates that Vibrio vulnificus Type 6 secretion systems have antibacterial activity in vivo  ap. 4381-4393.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aWith the rapid increase of aquaculture contributing to sustainable food security, comes the need to better understand seafood associated diseases. One of the major aquatic bacterial genera responsible for human infections from seafood is Vibrio, especially from oysters. Currently, in vivo study of bacterial interactions within oysters is limited by the inability to promote high‐level uptake of bacteria by oysters. This study has therefore evolved current natural marine snow protocols to generate ‘artificial’ marine snow, into which bacteria can be incorporated to facilitate extensive uptake by oysters. This presents an adaptable model for bacterial study within filter‐feeding shellfish. Using this model, we demonstrate for the first time the antibacterial activity of Vibrio vulnificus Type 6 secretion systems in vivo, revealing an important role for the T6SS in V. vulnificus ecology.  aPublisher supplied data  aNE/L002434/1cNatural Environment Research Council  aNE/L002434/1cThe Natural Environment Research Council 3aVibrio vulnificus 3aantibacterial properties 3aaquaculture 3aecology 3afood security 3ahumans 3amarine sediments 3amodels 3aoysters 3aseafoods 3ashellfish 3atype VI secretion system1 aMichell, Stephen Ll.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1413-49610 tEnvironmental microbiology.g2020 Oct., v. 22, no. 10 p.4381-4393dJohn Wiley & Sons, Inc.wJournal:jnl3867075x1462-29127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1462-2920.151233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04137naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002200153245014900175300001400324520272300338592002803061650001003089650001703099650001203116650001503128650001603143650001103159650001503170650001203185650002003197650001603217650002503233650001503258653001703273653001403290653001703304653002803321653002403349653002803373653002703401700001903428700002203447773010103469856008803570852000903658655001203667IND60592947320221120130759.0210201e201803  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059294732DNAL7 a10.1016/j.earscirev.2018.01.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRinderer, Michael10aAssessing structural, functional and effective hydrologic connectivity with brain neuroscience methods: State-of-the-art and research directions  ap. 29-47.  aWhile the concept of connectivity has gained popularity in fields like hydrology and ecology, little agreement exists on its definition, which hinders its use in both scientific and legal contexts. In contrast, neuroscientists have developed not only strong conceptualizations of connectivity but also tools to quantify it: a clear distinction is made between structural connectivity, which is determined from brain anatomy; functional connectivity, which is estimated based on statistical dependencies between neuronal electric timeseries; and effective connectivity, which infers causal relations from the same timeseries based on the assumption that “true” interactions occur with a certain time delay. The motivation of this review arose from the hypothesis that connectivity-related statistical techniques, which are applied to timeseries of electrical currents measured by placing electrodes on the scalp of the human brain, could also apply to high-frequency hydrological timeseries acquired to characterize catchment response to precipitation. Here we bring together existing conceptualizations of structural, functional and effective connectivity in hydrology and ecology and compare them with those used in brain neuroscience. We then summarize the most important brain connectivity measures and their associated mathematical frameworks before evaluating the potential of those measures to help advance our understanding of hydrologic connectivity properties – in terms of the frequency, magnitude, timing, duration and rate of water movement linking two disparate locations. Lastly, we present a short case study where a selection of brain connectivity measures is applied to 35 groundwater and streamflow timeseries from a Swiss catchment to infer subsurface flow-driven hydrologic connectivity. Our literature review combined with our short case study suggest that an ensemble of functional and effective connectivity measures should be used and constrained not only by structural connectivity measures but also by interpretation thresholds in order to make results parsimonious. We highlight challenges associated with transferring brain connectivity measures to hydrology, especially those related to choosing the appropriate length and sampling frequency of input timeseries when assessing perennial versus ephemeral connectivity, appropriately detecting and differentiating noisy from indirect connections, and interpreting unbounded connectivity measures. We then offer recommendations for future research and propose that hydrologists use a common classification system encompassing all potential connectivity assessment approaches and measures in order to facilitate scientific communication.  aPublisher supplied data 3abrain 3acase studies 3aecology 3aelectrodes 3agroundwater 3ahumans 3amotivation 3aneurons 3aneurophysiology 3astream flow 3atime series analysis 3awatersheds 0aConnectivity 0aHydrology 0aNeuroscience 0aStructural connectivity 0aTimeseries analysis 0aFunctional connectivity 0aEffective connectivity1 aAli, Genevieve1 aLarsen, Laurel G.0 tEarth-science reviews.g2018 Mar., v. 178 p.29-47dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11685x0012-82527nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.earscirev.2018.01.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02902naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094024002200121024001900143040001800162100002400180245010000204300001300304500002000317506007600337520128500413592002801698506003701726650001601763650001701779650002101796650001501817650002701832650001701859650001601876650002201892650001101914650001201925650001401937650001901951650001501970650001201985650002201997650002002019650001102039700002102050700002402071700001602095700002002111700002002131700002302151773009202174856007302266852000902339655001202348IND60580549520221207081720.0170921e201710  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058054952DNAL7 a10.1111/tpj.136402doi7 aPMC56379022pmcid7 a287418582pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWoolfenden, Hugh C.12aA computational approach for inferring the cell wall properties that govern guard cell dynamics  ap. 5-18.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aGuard cells dynamically adjust their shape in order to regulate photosynthetic gas exchange, respiration rates and defend against pathogen entry. Cell shape changes are determined by the interplay of cell wall material properties and turgor pressure. To investigate this relationship between turgor pressure, cell wall properties and cell shape, we focused on kidney‐shaped stomata and developed a biomechanical model of a guard cell pair. Treating the cell wall as a composite of the pectin‐rich cell wall matrix embedded with cellulose microfibrils, we show that strong, circumferentially oriented fibres are critical for opening. We find that the opening dynamics are dictated by the mechanical stress response of the cell wall matrix, and as the turgor rises, the pectinaceous matrix stiffens. We validate these predictions with stomatal opening experiments in selected Arabidopsis cell wall mutants. Thus, using a computational framework that combines a 3D biomechanical model with parameter optimization, we demonstrate how to exploit subtle shape changes to infer cell wall material properties. Our findings reveal that proper stomatal dynamics are built on two key properties of the cell wall, namely anisotropy in the form of hoop reinforcement and strain stiffening.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aArabidopsis 3abiomechanics 3acell respiration 3acell walls 3acellulose microfibrils 3agas exchange 3aguard cells 3amechanical stress 3amodels 3amutants 3apathogens 3aphotosynthesis 3aprediction 3astomata 3astomatal movement 3astress response 3aturgor1 aBourdais, Gildas1 aKopischke, Michaela1 aMiedes, Eva1 aMolina, Antonio1 aRobatzek, Silke1 aMorris, Richard J.0 tplant journal.g2017 Oct., v. 92, no. 1 p.5-18dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx0960-74127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/tpj.136403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02855naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003000092040001800122100001600140245011500156300001800271500000900289520177800298592002802076650001602104650002702120650001102147650001502158650001502173650001202188650001602200650001502216700001502231700001502246700001502261773013102276852000902407856007702416655001202493IND4447133020221122035433.0191228e201011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444713302DNAL7 a10.2136/vzj2010.00502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchelle, H.10aAnalysis of the Agreement of Soil Hydraulic Properties Obtained from Multistep-Outflow and Evaporation Methods  ap. 1080-1091.  aepub  aAccurate knowledge of the soil hydraulic properties is necessary to simulate water flow and solute transport in unsaturated soils. The multistep-outflow and evaporation methods are frequently used transient experimental methods for the simultaneous determination of the water retention and hydraulic conductivity functions in the laboratory. Despite the wide application of the two methods, relatively little attention has been paid to verifying the agreement of soil hydraulic properties obtained from them. Our objective was to compare the soil hydraulic properties obtained from the inversely evaluated multistep-outflow method with those received from a simplified evaporation method. We conducted outflow and evaporation experiments on two different soil types and compared the soil hydraulic functions obtained from both experiments. Parameter estimation was performed by applying parametric models of different complexity and flexibility and a free-form approach to avoid parameterization errors. We found that the two methods gave very similar results when the observed processes in the experiments could be well described by the applied models. Problems arose in cases where parametric models were not able to fit the observations of one or both experimental types. This illustrates the necessity of avoiding parameterization errors in the soil hydraulic properties when results of different experiments are compared. The measurement ranges of the two methods where the results are reliable are noticeably different. Extrapolation of hydraulic functions to the moisture range not covered by the experiments is a potential source of error for flow predictions. It is crucial to acknowledge that such errors cannot be identified by applying one of the methods alone.  aPublisher supplied data 3aevaporation 3ahydraulic conductivity 3amodels 3aprediction 3asoil types 3asolutes 3avadose zone 3awater flow1 aIden, S.C.1 aPeters, A.1 aDurner, W.0 tVadose zone journal.g2010 Nov., v. 9, no. 4 p.1080-1091dSoil Science Society of AmericawJournal:jnl3674032x1539-16637nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2136/vzj2010.00503Available from publisher's site 7aarticle02884naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002500139245014000164300001600304500002000320520152100340592002801861650001701889650001101906650001001917650001501927650001601942650001501958650001201973650001501985650001102000650001702011650001602028650001202044650001302056650001602069650001702085650001202102650001202114650001202126650001802138700001902156700001802175700002002193773009502213856007302308852000902381655001202390IND60580549620221119155949.0170921e201710  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058054962DNAL7 a10.1111/tpj.136332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRotsch, Alexander H.10aCentral metabolite and sterol profiling divides tobacco male gametophyte development and pollen tube growth into eight metabolic phases  ap. 129-146.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aWhile changes in the transcriptome and proteome of developing pollen have been investigated in tobacco and other species, the metabolic consequences remain rather unclear. Here, a broad range of metabolites was investigated in close succession of developmental stages. Thirteen stages of tobacco male gametophyte development were collected, ranging from tetrads to pollen tubes. Subsequently, the central metabolome and sterol composition were analyzed by GC‐mass spectrometry (MS), monitoring 77 metabolites and 29 non‐identified analytes. The overall results showed that development and tube growth could be divided into eight metabolic phases with the phase including mitosis I being most distinct. During maturation, compounds such as sucrose and proline accumulated. These were degraded after rehydration, while γ‐aminobutyrate transiently increased, possibly deriving from proline breakdown. Sterol analysis revealed that tetrads harbor similar sterols as leaves, but throughout maturation unusual sterols increased. Lastly, two further sterols exclusively accumulated in pollen tubes. This study allows a deeper look into metabolic changes during the development of a quasi‐single cell type. Metabolites accumulating during maturation might accelerate pollen germination and tube growth, protect from desiccation, and feed pollinators. Future studies of the underlying processes orchestrating the changes in metabolite levels might give valuable insights into cellular regulation of plant metabolism.  aPublisher supplied data 3agametophytes 3aleaves 3amales 3ametabolism 3ametabolites 3ametabolome 3amitosis 3amonitoring 3apollen 3apollen tubes 3apollinators 3aproline 3aproteome 3arehydration 3aspectroscopy 3asterols 3asucrose 3atobacco 3atranscriptome1 aKopka, Joachim1 aFeussner, Ivo1 aIschebeck, Till0 tplant journal.g2017 Oct., v. 92, no. 1 p.129-146dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx0960-74127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/tpj.136333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02601naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100007000151245012400221520120000345592002801545650001501573650001501588650001601603650002001619650001601639650001501655650001401670650001501684650002301699650002201722653002101744653003501765653001901800653001501819653001101834653001001845700006101855700005901916773010901975856008602084852000902170655001202179IND60670264420221121034621.0200210e201911  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067026442DNAL7 a10.1016/j.soilbio.2019.1076082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRaymond-Léonard, Laura J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7324-784312aA novel set of traits to describe Collembola mouthparts: taking a bite out of the broad chewing mandible classification  aThe use of functional traits in arthropod ecology has gained in popularity and could be a valuable tool to predict consumer-resource interactions among soil invertebrates. Currently, Collembola feeding strategies are categorized very broadly with either piercing-sucking or chewing mouthparts, despite the diversity of resources they consume. This study described and measured a new set of Collembola mandibular traits in order to better discriminate chewing species based on their mouthpart morphology. Then, we evaluated whether these consumer traits covaried with various litter quality resource traits (physical, chemical or microbial). Out of our 50 studied species, 42 clustered significantly in seven new chewing mandible functional groups. Neither body length, nor phylogeny, were adequate proxies for this set of mandibular traits given tremendous variation across closely related species. Furthermore, when covariation with litter traits occurred, Collembola mandibular traits explained just as much covariation as species composition. These novel traits describing Collembola mouthparts could be a promising venue for predicting feeding interactions of Collembola and their resources.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCollembola 3aarthropods 3abody length 3afeeding methods 3amastication 3amouthparts 3aphylogeny 3aprediction 3asoil invertebrates 3aspecies diversity 0aFunctional trait 0aConsumer-resource interactions 0aForaging trait 0aSpringtail 0aLitter 0aIDENT1 aGravel, Dominique1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4498-70761 aHanda, I.

The present study uses two ACTH-responsive adrenocortical cell-lines, to examine the role of CRTC on Star transcription. Here we show that ACTH-induced Star primary transcript or heteronuclear RNA (hnRNA), parallels rapid increases in nuclear levels of the 3 isoforms of CRTC; CRTC1, CRTC2 and CRTC3. Furthermore, ACTH promotes recruitment of CRTC2 and CRTC3 by the Star promoter and siRNA knockdown of either CRTC3 or CRTC2 attenuates the increases in ACTH-induced Star hnRNA. Using pharmacological inhibitors of PKA, MAP kinase and calcineurin, we show that the effects of ACTH on Star transcription and CRTC nuclear translocation depend predominantly on the PKA pathway. The data provides evidence that CRTC2 and CRTC3, contribute to activation of Star transcription by ACTH, and that PKA/CRTC-dependent pathways are part of the multifactorial mechanisms regulating Star transcription.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acAMP-dependent protein kinase 3acell lines 3acorticotropin 3amessenger RNA 3amitogen-activated protein kinase 3asmall interfering RNA 3asteroidogenic acute regulatory protein 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranscriptional activation 0aCRTC 0aStAR 0aCREB 0aSteroidogenesis 0aAdrenal cortex 0aTranscription1 aHuang, Victoria1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4037-9898 https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4037-9898 https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4037-98981 aOlah, Mark1 aTrinh, Loc1 aLiu, Ying1 aHazell, Georgina1 aConway-Campbell, Becky1 aZhao, Zidong1 aMartinez, Antoinec(Microbiologist)1 aLefrançois-Martinez, Anne-Marie1 aLightman, Stafford1 aSpiga, Francesca1 aAguilera, Greti0 tMolecular and cellular endocrinology.g2019 Oct. 04, dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12477x0303-72077nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.mce.2019.1106123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02018naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245009000166300001600256520098400272592002801256650001301284650001501297650001101312650000901323650002501332650001301357653002401370653002401394653000901418700001601427700002101443773011101464856008401575852000901659655001201668IND60121878620221122044024.0150325e20140223xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012187862DNAL7 a10.1080/01904167.2013.8604602doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShaver, Tim10aEvaluation of two crop canopy sensors for nitrogen recommendations in irrigated maize  ap. 406-419.  aCrop canopy sensors can provide valuable information about in-field nitrogen (N) variability in maize (Zea mays L.) and can serve as the basis for in-season N recommendations. However, few studies have been conducted to determine how the sensors compare. Therefore, a study was conducted using the two most prominent crop canopy sensors (NTech's GreenSeeker™ red and Holland Scientific's Crop Circle™ amber) to determine if the different sensors recommended different amounts of N at the V12 maize growth stage. Results show that each sensor recommended the same amount of N at the V12 growth stage (N recommendations by sensor were not significantly different). The N algorithms developed for each sensor also calculated unbiased N recommendations suggesting that the methodology of algorithm development was valid as was the estimate of required N at maize growth stage V12. Therefore, both crop canopy sensors performed equally in terms of N recommendations in this study.  aPublisher supplied data 3aZea mays 3aalgorithms 3acanopy 3acorn 3adevelopmental stages 3anitrogen 0acrop canopy sensors 0anitrogen management 0aNDVI1 aKhosla, Raj1 aWestfall, Dwayne0 tJournal of plant nutrition.g2014 Feb. 23, v. 37, no. 3 p.406-419dTaylor & Francis Groupx1532-40877nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01904167.2013.8604603Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04023naa a2200733 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245014500167300001600312520192000328592002802248650001702276650002502293650001202318650001202330650001102342650002602353650001102379650002402390650001102414650002802425650002202453650002202475650002302497650000902520650000902529650001402538650001402552650001102566650002102577650001402598650001902612650001502631650002202646650001402668650003302682650001102715650001102726650002902737650001702766650001802783650002202801650001202823650001602835650001702851650001502868650000902883651001502892653001802907653002902925653002502954653001802979700002002997700003003017700002003047773011803067856008303185852000903268655001203277IND60532622020221119135707.0190415s2015    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053262202DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ufug.2015.08.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMarozas, Vitas10aComparison of neophyte communities of Robinia pseudoacacia L. and Acer negundo L. in the eastern Baltic Sea region cities of Riga and Kaunas  ap. 826-834.  aIn this study, we examined the species composition of neophyte communities of Robinia pseudoacacia and Acer negundo and compared the site conditions of the urban environment of two cities—Riga and Kaunas. Eighty-five plots of A. negundo and R. pseudoacacia communities were selected. Within each plot, all of the vascular plant species were recorded, and their abundance was estimated in 2014. Composite soil samples of the 0–10cm mineral topsoil were collected for the estimation of the soil chemical properties at nine systematically distributed points in each sample plot. The soil pHKCL, exchangeable bases, total nitrogen, total organic matter, C/N ratio, and concentrations of the elements (P, K, Ca, Mg, Fe, Mn, Zn, Cu, Na, Pb, Cd, and Ni) were estimated. Canonical correspondence analysis was used to analyse the vegetation data. An indicator species analysis was carried out. The relationship between the soil chemical parameters was assessed by principal component analysis, and the results showed that structure and composition of the plant communities of A. negundo and R. pseudoacacia differed. The number of species was lower and the herb layer was more developed in R. pseudoacacia communities, whereas the structure of communities differed between Riga and Kaunas. The cover of the shrub layer was more developed in Riga. The number of species in A. negundo communities was similar, whereas the number of species in R. pseudoacacia communities was lower in Kaunas. Alien species were more frequent in Riga. Neophyte communities in Kaunas were more homogenous. The soil in communities in Riga had more carbon, was richer in nutrients and more acidic than in Kaunas. R. pseudoacacia grew in more fertile soils than A. negundo communities. The differences between the neophyte communities in Riga and Kaunas were caused by differing geological parameters, soil development and urbanization effects.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcer negundo 3aRobinia pseudoacacia 3acadmium 3acalcium 3acarbon 3acarbon nitrogen ratio 3acities 3acommunity structure 3acopper 3acorrespondence analysis 3aground vegetation 3aindicator species 3aintroduced species 3airon 3alead 3amagnesium 3amanganese 3anickel 3anitrogen content 3anutrients 3aorganic matter 3aphosphorus 3aplant communities 3apotassium 3aprincipal component analysis 3ashrubs 3asodium 3asoil chemical properties 3asoil ecology 3asoil sampling 3aspecies diversity 3atopsoil 3aurban areas 3aurbanization 3avegetation 3azinc 3aBaltic Sea 0aAlien species 0aSoil chemical properties 0aSynanthrophic plants 0aUrban forests1 aCekstere, Gunta1 aLaivin̦š, M.q(Māris),1 aStraigyte, Lina0 tUrban forestry & urban greening.g2015, v. 14, no. 4 p.826-834dElsevier GmbHwJournal:jnl893556x1618-86677nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ufug.2015.08.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02321naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245010300166300001600269520086600285592002801151650001801179650001001197650001001207650001201217650002301229650001601252650001401268650001101282650001501293650001501308650001101323650001101334650001401345650001001359650000901369650001701378651001001395653004601405653001801451653002601469653001501495700001701510700001501527700001401542700001401556700001701570773011101587856008401698852000901782655001201791IND60121878720221122034145.0150325e20140223xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012187872DNAL7 a10.1080/01904167.2013.8643052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMeng, C.

However, the causes of shoot dieback have not been determined. The results of leaf analysis and correction experiment showed that leaf boron (B) concentrations were highly correlated with leaf area (P < 0.01), spring shoot length (P < 0.01), and spring shoot numbers sprouting from one old shoot (P < 0.05). Foliar application of B at 2.0 g L –¹ of borax was more effective on correcting shoot dieback than foliar application of Zn at 2.0 g L –¹ of zinc sulfate and of molybdenum (Mo) at 2.0 g L –¹ of ammonium molybdate. Boron application increased fruit yields by 1.23–2.15 times compared with the control. Shoot dieback resulted mainly from B deficiency in the red bayberry trees.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMorella rubra 3aborax 3aboron 3adieback 3afoliar application 3afruit yield 3aleaf area 3aleaves 3amolybdates 3amolybdenum 3ashoots 3aspring 3asprouting 3atrees 3azinc 3azinc sulfate 3aChina 0ared bayberry (Myrica rubra Sieb. et Zuca) 0ashoot dieback 0anutritional diagnosis 0acorrection1 aJiang, P.

However, most analyses of gene expression in stress responses examine individual stresses. In this report, we compare gene expression in individual and combined stresses. We show that combined stress treatments with salt, mannitol and heat induce a unique pattern of gene expression that is not a simple merge of the individual stress responses. Under multiple stress conditions, expression of most heat and salt stress‐responsive genes increased to levels similar to or higher than those measured in single stress conditions, but osmotic stress‐responsive genes increased to lower levels. Genes up‐regulated to higher levels under multiple stress condition than single stress conditions include genes for heat shock proteins, heat shock regulators and late embryogenesis abundant proteins (LEAs), which protect other proteins from damage caused by stresses, suggesting their importance in multiple stress condition. Based on this analysis, we identify candidate genes for engineering crop plants tolerant to multiple stresses.  aPublisher supplied data 3acrops 3aengineering 3agene expression 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3ahabitats 3aheat 3aheat shock proteins 3aheat stress 3amannitol 3aplant proteins 3aplant response 3astress response 2aArabidopsisxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aDesert Climate 2aEnvironment 2aGene Expression Profiling. 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plant 2aGenes, Plant 2aGenetic Association Studies 2aGenome, Plantxgenetics 2aRegulatory Sequences, Nucleic Acidxgenetics 2aStress, Physiologicalxgenetics 2aTranscriptomexgenetics 2aUp-Regulationxgenetics1 aOSHIMA, YOSHIMI1 aMITSUDA, NOBUTAKA1 aOHME‐TAKAGI, MASARU0 tPlant, cell and environment.g2014 Sept., v. 37, no. 9 p.2024-2035dBlackwell Sciencex0140-77917nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/pce.122743Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02597naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002200148245006900170300001600239520149300255592002801748650001601776650001401792650001101806650001301817650001301830650000801843650001101851650001201862651001501874700002801889700002201917700002201939700002301961773011301984856008202097990002302179852000902202655001202211IND60095153320221122041408.0141104e20110515xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009515332DNAL7 a10.1016/j.epsl.2011.02.0522doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWinberry, J. Paul10aDynamics of stick–slip motion, Whillans Ice Stream, Antarctica  ap. 283-289.  aThe stick–slip motion and associated seismic emissions of Whillans Ice Stream (WIS), West Antarctica are two of the many recent observations of unexpected ice sheet behavior that are challenging traditional models of rapid glacier motion. Here we find that the WIS slip events repeatedly nucleate from a sticky-spot located in the middle of the ice stream, acting similar to an asperity in traditional models of earthquake physics. This region shows less motion than surrounding areas during the inter-slip periods, thus, concentrating stress and producing a pulse of seismic energy at the onset of slip. The propagating rupture breaks through an additional asperity in the northern part of the ice stream, producing another pulse of seismic energy 6–12min after initiation. Both asperities are regions of higher hydraulic potential than surrounding regions, suggesting they may have greater bed friction due to reduced water lubrication. Tidal pacing of the stress accumulation combined with fault healing controls the applied stress at failure, with higher stress giving faster propagation of the rupture front and higher slip velocities; these differences are reflected in the timing of the teleseismic arrivals. Our results highlight both the great sensitivity of large ice streams to small changes in external forcing and the importance of limited regions of the subglacial bed in controlling their motion, as well as providing insights to the mechanics of repeating earthquakes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aearthquakes 3aemissions 3aenergy 3afriction 3aglaciers 3aice 3amodels 3astreams 3aAntarctica1 aAnandakrishnan, Sridhar1 aWiens, Douglas A.1 aAlley, Richard B.1 aChristianson, Knut0 tEarth and planetary science letters.g2011 May 15, v. 305, no. 3-4 p.283-289dElsevier B.V.x0012-821X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.epsl.2011.02.0523Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02432naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001800139245011300157520128500270592002801555650003001583650001201613650001701625650001201642650001101654650001501665650002401680650000901704650002801713651001001741700002001751700001401771700001801785700002001803700002001823773012001843856007401963852000902037655001202046IND60771280820221123040957.0220325e20220319xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077128082DNAL7 a10.3390/f130304802doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Jiajun 10aImproved Prediction of Forest Fire Risk in Central and Northern China by a Time-Decaying Precipitation Model  aWith the increase in extreme climate events, forest fires burn in much larger areas. Therefore, it is important to accurately predict forest fire frequencies. Precipitation is an important factor that affects the probability of future forest fires. Previous models used average precipitation values, but the attenuation of precipitation was not considered. In this study, a time-decaying precipitation algorithm was used to calculate the comprehensive precipitation index. This method can better represent the effect of precipitation in predicting the occurrence of forest fires. Moreover, observed fire spots were converted into a continuous density of fire spots. The structure of the prediction model is more realistic, which is conducive to obtaining higher-precision prediction results. Additionally, the support vector machine (SVM) regression model was used to construct a forest fire warning model. When the comprehensive precipitation index was compared with the average precipitation value, the accuracy of the four forest areas in central and northern China in the test set was improved by approximately 10%. The findings are relevant to forest ecologists and managers for future mitigation of forest fires, and also for successful prediction of other fire-prone areas.  aPublisher supplied data 3aatmospheric precipitation 3aclimate 3aforest fires 3aforests 3amodels 3aprediction 3aregression analysis 3arisk 3asupport vector machines 3aChina1 aWang, Xiaoqing 1 aYu, Ying 1 aYuan, Xinzhe 1 aQuan, Xiangyin 1 aHuang, Haifeng 0 tForests.g2022 Mar. 19, v. 13, no. 3dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2257x1999-49077nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/f130304803Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02720naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002900151245008100180300001600261520128300277592002801560650002101588650002401609650002201633650001801655650001601673650001901689650001801708650001001726650002101736650001401757650000701771650001901778650001601797650001801813650001401831650003401845653002401879653001201903653001201915700002501927700002601952700002601978773013902004856008602143852000902229655001202238IND60786442220221122041552.0220803e20220809xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078644222DNAL7 a10.1080/10498850.2022.20931482doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAyodeji  Ahmed, Ayeloja10aEffect of Post Slaughter Time Interval (PSI) on the Quality of Heteroclarias  ap. 649-657.  aPost-slaughter time interval (PSI) plays an important role in the resultant quality of fish product. However, there is little information on the effect of PSI on heteroclarias, which is the most cultured fish in the study area. Forty-two samples of heteroclarias (average weight 500 ± 10.0 g) were collected, euthanized using salt, and stored at ambient temperature (27 ± 3°C); samples were collected at 0, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, and 24 hours for sensory, histological, proximate, biochemical, and microbial assessments using standard procedures. Data obtained were analyzed using SPSS 16.0 version. Most sensory attributes were retained for 12 hours PSI; however, crude protein, minerals, and pH were reduced significantly (p < .05) with increased PSI, and the total volatile base nitrogen, peroxide value, and free fatty acid increased significantly (p < .05) with increased PSI. The total viable count, total fungal count, total coliform count, fecal coliform count, and Escherichia coli also increased significantly (p < .05) with increased PSI but were within acceptable limits for good-quality fish. Heteroclarias should not be delayed beyond 12-hour PSI before preserving or processing in order to get best-quality raw material (fish) for consumers.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aambient temperature 3acoliform bacteria 3acrude protein 3afarmed fish 3afecal bacteria 3afish products 3afoods 3afree fatty acids 3ahistology 3apH 3aperoxide value 3aplate count 3araw materials 3aslaughter 3atotal volatile basic nitrogen 0aPost-slaughter time 0asensory 0aquality1 aWasiu Adeyemi, Jimoh1 aKehinde Joseph, Titus1 aEniola Racheal, Lawal0 tJournal of aquatic food product technology.g2022 Aug. 09, v. 31, no. 7 p.649-657dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl47704x1547-06367nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10498850.2022.20931483Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03091naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001900146245013600165300001800301520182800319592002802147650001502175650002402190650001202214650001302226650002302239650001102262650001302273650001602286650001302302650000702315650001502322650001302337650002502350650001602375700002502391700002102416700002002437773012102457856008202578852000902660655001202669IND60565663920221119035308.0170325e20170323xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056566392DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcb.7b000352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShin, Jae Yoon10aFirst Evidence of Vibrationally Driven Bimolecular Reactions in Solution: Reactions of Br Atoms with Dimethylsulfoxide and Methanol  ap. 2486-2494.  aWe present evidence for vibrational enhancement of the rate of bimolecular reactions of Br atoms with dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) and methanol (CH₃OH) in the condensed phase. The abstraction of a hydrogen atom from either of these solvents by a Br atom is highly endoergic: 3269 cm–¹ for DMSO and 1416 or 4414 cm–¹ for CH₃OH, depending on the hydrogen atom abstracted. Thus, there is no thermal abstraction reaction at room temperature. Broadband electronic transient absorption shows that following photolysis of bromine precursors Br atoms form van der Waals complexes with the solvent molecules in about 5 ps and this Br•–solvent complex undergoes recombination. To explore the influence of vibrational energy on the abstraction reactions, we introduce a near-infrared (NIR) pump pulse following the photolysis pulse to excite the first overtone of the CH (or OH) stretch of the solvent molecules. Using single-wavelength detection, we observe a loss of the Br•–solvent complex that requires the presence of both photolysis and NIR pump pulses. Moreover, the magnitude of this loss depends on the NIR wavelength. Although this loss of reactive Br supports the notion of vibrationally driven chemistry, it is not concrete evidence of the hydrogen-abstraction reaction. To verify that the loss of reactive Br results from the vibrationally driven bimolecular reaction, we examine the pH dependence of the solution (as a measure of the formation of the HBr product) following long-time irradiation of the sample with both photolysis and NIR pump beams. We observe that when the NIR beam is on-resonance, the hydronium ion concentration increases fourfold as compared to that when it is off-resonance, suggesting the formation of HBr via a vibrationally driven hydrogen-abstraction reaction in solution.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3aambient temperature 3abromine 3aconcrete 3adimethyl sulfoxide 3aenergy 3ahydrogen 3airradiation 3amethanol 3apH 3aphotolysis 3asolvents 3avan der Waals forces 3awavelengths1 aShaloski, Michael A.1 aCrim, F.

Different strategies have been developed and applied to combat PRRS at farm level. The broad variety of available intervention strategies makes it difficult to decide on the most cost-efficient strategy for a given farm situation, as it depends on many farm-individual factors like disease severity, prices or farm structure. Aim of this study was to create a simulation tool to estimate the cost-efficiency of different control strategies at individual farm level. Baseline is a model that estimates the costs of PRRS, based on changes in health and productivity, in a specific farm setting (e.g. farm type, herd size, type of batch farrowing).The model evaluates different intervention scenarios: depopulation/repopulation (D/R), close & roll-over (C&R), mass vaccination of sows (MS), mass vaccination of sows and vaccination of piglets (MS + piglets), improvements in internal biosecurity (BSM), and combinations of vaccinations with BSM. Data on improvement in health and productivity parameters for each intervention were obtained through literature review and from expert opinions. The economic efficiency of the different strategies was assessed over 5 years through investment appraisals: the resulting expected value (EV) indicated the most cost-effective strategy. Calculations were performed for 5 example scenarios with varying farm type (farrow-to-finish – breeding herd), disease severity (slightly – moderately – severely affected) and PRRSV detection (yes – no). The assumed herd size was 1000 sows with farm and price structure as commonly found in Germany. In a moderately affected (moderate deviations in health and productivity parameters from what could be expected in an average negative herd), unstable farrow-to-finish herd, the most cost-efficient strategies according to their median EV were C&R (€1′126′807) and MS + piglets (€ 1′114′649). In a slightly affected farrow-to-finish herd, no virus detected, the highest median EV was for MS + piglets (€ 721′745) and MS (€ 664′111). Results indicate that the expected benefits of interventions and the most efficient strategy depend on the individual farm situation, e.g. disease severity. The model provides new insights regarding the cost-efficiency of various PRRSV intervention strategies at farm level. It is a valuable tool for farmers and veterinarians to estimate expected economic consequences of an intervention for a specific farm setting and thus enables a better informed decision.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPorcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus 3abiosecurity 3abreeding 3acost effectiveness 3adisease severity 3aeconomic impact 3aexpert opinion 3afarm structure 3afarmers 3afarms 3afarrowing 3aherd size 3amodels 3apiglets 3aporcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome 3aprices 3asows 3aswine production 3avaccination 3aveterinarians 3aGermany 0aPRRSV epidemiology 0aPRRS control 0aCost of interventions 0aFarm-level measures 0aEconomic modelling1 aAlarcon, P.1 aRushton, James,1 aJolie, R.1 aFiebig, K.1 aJimenez, M.1 aGeurts, V.1 aNathues, C.0 tPreventive veterinary medicine.g2018 Apr. 01, v. 152 p.89-102dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl34182x0167-58777nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.prevetmed.2018.02.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02817naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100003400139245018900173300001800362520152200380592002801902650002101930650001501951650001401966650002301980650002102003650001802024650002102042650001902063650001902082650001802101650001202119650001602131700002502147700002802172700003002200773010502230856007502335852000902410655001202419IND60577842920180802000000.0170810e20130813xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057784292DNAL7 a10.1021/ma400894t2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAguirre-Chagala, Yanet

Effect of Hydrophobic Block Chemistry on Nanoparticle Properties  ap. 5871-5881.  aThe organocatalytic copolymerization of a derivative of trimethylene carbonate bearing protected 1,3-diols and d,l-lactide was studied. Homopolymerization of the cyclic carbonate from a PEG macroinitiator exhibited a controlled character, obeying pseudo first-order kinetics up to a conversion of ∼60%. Longer reactions resulted in more polydisperse materials. Kinetics of copolymerization with DLLA showed a considerable accelerative effect of the ester on the polymerizability of the carbonate, attributed to relief of steric limitations that characterize the polymerization of this and other bulky cyclic carbonates. Postpolymerization hydrogenolysis, conveniently adjusted though catalyst concentration, yielded functional poly(ester carbonate)s (PECs) with enhanced chain mobility and hydrophilicity compared to protected analogues. PEG-b-PECs were further used as stabilizers for the formation of fluorophore nanoparticles via flash nanoprecipitation. Nanoparticle size and core properties were discussed in terms of hydrophobic block chemistry. The regulation offered by organocatalysts for the synthesis of diol-functionalized PECs with precise molecular characteristics provides access to biodegradable materials with readily tunable physicochemical properties through controlled installation of reactive handles. In the context of hydrophobic solute encapsulation, regulated functionalization allows fine-tuning of nanoparticle core properties, ultimately impacting solute loading, release, and stability.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiodegradability 3acarbonates 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3acopolymerization 3aencapsulation 3afluorescent dyes 3ahydrophilicity 3ahydrophobicity 3ananoparticles 3asolutes 3astabilizers1 aSantos, José Luís,1 aHerrera-Nájera, Rafael1 aHerrera-Alonso, Margarita0 tMacromolecules.g2013 Aug. 13, v. 46, no. 15 p.5871-5881dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fma400894t3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02778naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245015600172300001600328520107900344592002801423650001701451650002901468650001601497650001301513650002101526650002401547650001201571650001501583650002101598650000901619650001401628650002001642650001301662650001601675650002101691650002001712650001501732650001701747650002001764650001401784650001701798650001301815650000901828653001601837653002901853653002901882653001901911653002001930700002301950700002301973773011101996856008402107852000902191655001202200IND60121879020221120194258.0150325e20140223xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012187902DNAL7 a10.1080/01904167.2013.8643082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNimnoi, Pongrawee10aCo-inoculation of soybean (glycine max) with actinomycetes and bradyrhizobium japonicum enhances plant growth, nitrogenase activity and plant nutrition  ap. 432-446.  aThe aim of this study was to determine the potential of the endophytic actinomycetes that produce plant growth promoters used as co-inoculants with Bradyrhizobium japonicum to promote the growth of soybean. These endophytes exhibited the potential to enhance plant growth, nitrogenase activity of root nodules and plant nutrient uptake. Co-inoculum of B. japonicum with Nocardia alba conferred the maximum yield of root and shoot dry weight. All single-inoculated actinomycetes strains had the ability to enhance plant growth. Noc. alba and Nonomuraea rubra increased total plant dry weight up to 2.14-fold and 2.11-fold, respectively, when compared to the uninoculated controls. Co-inoculations of B. japonicum with each of Noc. alba , Non. Rubra , and Actinomadura glauciflava increased acetylene reduction activity up to 1.7 to 2.7-fold. For plant mineral composition, all of co-inoculation treatments significantly increased the nutrient levels of nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), potassium (K), calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg), iron (Fe) and zinc (Zn) within a soybean plant.  aPublisher supplied data 3aActinomadura 3aBradyrhizobium japonicum 3aGlycine max 3aNocardia 3aNonomuraea rubra 3aacetylene reduction 3acalcium 3aendophytes 3agrowth promotion 3airon 3amagnesium 3amineral content 3anitrogen 3anitrogenase 3anutrient content 3anutrient uptake 3aphosphorus 3aplant growth 3aplant nutrition 3apotassium 3aroot nodules 3asoybeans 3azinc 0aGlycine max 0aendophytic actinomycetes 0aBradyrhizobium japonicum 0aco-inoculation 0aplant nutrition1 aPongsilp, Neelawan1 aLumyong, Saisamorn0 tJournal of plant nutrition.g2014 Feb. 23, v. 37, no. 3 p.432-446dTaylor & Francis Groupx1532-40877nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01904167.2013.8643083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03877naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100006100153245010600214300002000320500001900340520234600359592002802705650001802733650001102751650001502762650001102777650001902788650001302807650002202820650004402842650001402886650001902900650001102919700006802930700005402998700002303052700002403075700006603099700006003165773012203225856008703347852000903434655001203443IND60713670820210419000000.0201023e20200826xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071367082DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.energyfuels.0c022712doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCampuzano, Felipe1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7172-309510aFuel and Chemical Properties of Waste Tire Pyrolysis Oil Derived from a Continuous Twin-Auger Reactor  ap. 12688-12702.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aTire pyrolysis oil (TPO) is a complex mixture of hydrocarbons (HC), and it is one of the useful fractions obtained from the pyrolysis of waste tires (WT). As a result of its high energy density (HHV ∼ 43 MJ/kg), TPO use as a fuel in combustion systems is a promising approach for recycling WT. However, fundamental fuel characteristics and combustion properties of TPO are still unexplored, which stand as a bottleneck for potential applications. This work pursues a comprehensive understanding of the structural characteristics of a TPO produced in a lab-scale twin-auger reactor as a first step toward defining applications and upgrading strategies. Therefore, advanced analytical techniques such as Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FT-ICR MS) and ¹H and ¹³C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy were utilized. In addition, we also present the characterization of a TPO obtained from adding CaO to WT, as a low-cost catalytic material for its in situ upgrading, herein named TPO[CaO]. FT-ICR MS results revealed the significant presence of pure HC (HC₍TPO₎ = 74.9% and HC₍TPO[CₐO]₎ = 78.6%) and HC containing one sulfur atom (S₁) (S₁₍TPO₎ = 14.3% and S₁₍TPO[CₐO]₎ = 13.9%). HC compounds were found mainly in the form of triaromatics (26%), tetra-aromatics (13 and 15%), and penta-aromatics (22 and 30%), while S₁ compounds were found mainly in the form of dibenzothiophene (31%) and benzonaphthothiophene (34%). The resolved compounds by means of FT-ICR MS exhibited an average double bond equivalent (DBE) number of 11.3 and 12.2 for TPO and TPO[CaO], respectively. These high DBE values were indicators of the significant presence of condensed aromatic structures. ¹H NMR analysis showed that hydrogen atoms in methylene (CH₂), methyl (CH₃), and naphthenic groups and hydrogen atoms in aromatic structures make up more than 80% of both fuels. Similarly, carbon atoms in paraffinic groups (both CH₂ and CH₃) and protonated carbons in aromatic rings together form more than 50% of the carbon atoms in TPO and TPO[CaO]. The information reported in this work provides new insights into the structural characteristics of the TPO obtained in a promising technology as the twin-auger reactor for its use as a fuel, as well as for the design of upgrading strategies.  aPublisher supplied data 3acalcium oxide 3acarbon 3acombustion 3aenergy 3aenergy density 3ahydrogen 3amass spectrometry 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3apyrolysis 3apyrolysis oils 3asulfur1 aAbdul Jameel, Abdul Gani1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2219-48141 aZhang, Wen1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8847-16641 aEmwas, Abdul-Hamid1 aAgudelo, Andrés F.1 aMartínez, Juan Daniel1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5075-51351 aSarathy, S.

However, the involvement of MaNAC1 in propylene‐induced cold tolerance of banana fruits is not understood. In the present work, the possible involvement of MaNAC1 in cold tolerance of banana fruits was investigated. MaNAC1 was noticeably induced by cold stress or following propylene treatment during cold storage. Transient protoplast assays showed that MaNAC1 promoter was activated by cold stress and ethylene treatment. Yeast one‐hybrid (Y1H), electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) and transient expression assays demonstrated MaNAC1 as a novel direct target of MaICE1, and that the ability of MaICE1 binding to MaNAC1 promoter might be enhanced by MaICE1 phosphorylation and cold stress. Moreover, yeast two‐hybrid (Y2H) and bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) analyses revealed physical interaction between MaNAC1 and MaCBF1, a downstream component of inducer of C‐repeat binding factor (CBF) expression 1 (ICE1) in cold signalling. Taken together, these results suggest that the cold‐responsive MaNAC1 may be involved in cold tolerance of banana fruits through its interaction with ICE1–CBF cold signalling pathway, providing new insights into the regulatory activity of NAC TF.  aPublisher supplied data 3abananas 3acold 3acold storage 3acold stress 3acold tolerance 3aelectrophoresis 3aethylene 3afluorescence 3afruits 3agenes 3aphosphorylation 3apropylene 3aripening 3atranscription factors 3ayeasts 2aAdaptation, Physiologicalxdrug effects 2aAlkenesxpharmacology 2aCold Temperature 2aElectrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay 2aEthylenesxpharmacology 2aFluorescence 2aFruitxdrug effectsxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plantxdrug effects 2aLuciferasesxmetabolism 2aMusaxdrug effectsxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aPhosphorylationxdrug effects 2aPlant Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aPromoter Regions, Geneticxgenetics 2aProtein Bindingxdrug effects 2aStress, Physiologicalxdrug effects 2aTranscription Factorsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aTwo-Hybrid System Techniques1 aKUANG, JIAN‐FEI1 aLU, WANG‐JIN1 aCHEN, JIAN‐YE0 tPlant, cell and environment.g2014 Sept., v. 37, no. 9 p.2116-2127dBlackwell Sciencex0140-77917nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/pce.123033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02308naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245011200171300001600283520090200299592002801201650001401229650002001243650002101263650001601284650001901300650000901319650001301328650001601341650001901357650001101376650002001387650002501407650001101432650002501443650000901468653000901477653003101486653002101517653003101538700001801569700001701587700001801604773011101622856008401733852000901817655001201826IND60121879120221120184221.0150325e20140223xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012187912DNAL7 a10.1080/01904167.2013.8643092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAshraf, M.

A decrease in growth and yield related parameters were observed under salt stress, which was ameliorated in plants that received Zn foliar spray. Similar effects of salinity and Zn foliar spray were noted on photosynthetic rate, transpiration rate, stomatal conductance, water use efficiency, and water relations of plants. Salt induced increase in sodium (Na) content and decrease in other macro- and micronutrients contents were also reversed by Zn.

These particles mainly stick to the combustion chamber wall and represent a material loss. To predict the amount of particle-wall contacts in such furnaces, a numerical model based on transient multiphase flow calculations is presented in this work. The proposed model differs from the current state-of-the-art CFD models as follows: Instead of using the commonly used RANS turbulence models (realizable-k-ε model, Reynolds stress model) and steady state calculations, large eddy simulations (LES) of the multiphase flow in the furnace in combination with a type of RANS mesh were performed. Furthermore, the applicability of the LES technique was evaluated by comparing the numerical results to measurements. It was found that the proposed numerical model provides more accurate prediction performance than applying common RANS turbulence models.  aPublisher supplied data 3acombustion 3afurnaces 3aprediction 3aturbulent flow 0aBoiler slag particles 0aParticle-wall contacts 0aEffects of turbulence modeling 0aLarge eddy simulations 0aMultiphase flow 0aComputational fluid dynamics1 aGerhardter, Hannes1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5759-80481 aHochenauer, Christoph1 aTomazic, Peter0 tPowder technology.g2020 Aug., v. 373 p.497-509dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11732x0032-59107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.powtec.2020.06.0733Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03908naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245011500165300001200280520249400292592002802786650005002814650000802864650001302872650001202885650001902897650001702916650001602933650001502949650002102964650001302985650001502998650002403013650001203037650002203049650003103071650001803102650001103120651001603131700002003147700002003167700002003187700001603207773011303223856008103336852000903417655001203426IND60572827520221120180801.0170718e201705  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057282752DNAL7 a10.1007/s12665-017-6666-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYu, Soonyoung10aComparison of volatile organic compounds in stormwater and groundwater in Seoul metropolitan city, South Korea  ap. 338.  aVolatile organic compounds (VOCs) detected in stormwater were compared with VOCs present in emission sources, air, groundwater, and influent to sewage treatment plants in Seoul to understand their fate and transport in the urban hydrological system. Stormwater is a carrier of non-point source pollutants and contains VOCs from land surfaces and air. Samples of stormwater and influent to sewage treatment plants were collected and analyzed for 61 VOCs, while the VOCs in emission sources, air and groundwater were investigated through literature reviews for comparison. The results showed that the most frequently detected VOCs in stormwater were similar to those in air. However, the atmospheric concentrations of benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylenes (BTEX), and methyl tertiary-butyl ether (MTBE) were too low to explain their frequent detection and high concentrations in stormwater. As a result, land surfaces seem to be a primary source of these VOCs in stormwater. Comparison of the VOCs in stormwater and groundwater showed that toluene and MTBE were frequently detected in both media, but more often and at higher concentrations in stormwater. This finding indicates that stormwater recharge is a source of toluene and MTBE in groundwater. Regarding groundwater, land surfaces seem to be a primary source of toluene, while urban air is the primary source in the case of MTBE. Specifically, the MTBE values in air were sufficiently high to explain its levels in groundwater, which had continually increased and remained low afterward. Furthermore, the high ratios of TEX (toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylenes) to benzene and MTBE in stormwater indicated that TEX had additional sources other than vehicles, most likely hydrocarbon solvents. These solvents seem to be a primary source of TEX and other frequently detected VOCs in stormwater. However, trichloroethylene (TCE), tetrachloroethylene (PCE) and their dechlorination intermediates were far more frequently detected and at higher concentrations in groundwater than in stormwater. Additionally, their concentrations frequently exceeded the water-quality criteria. It seems that halogenated solvents had produced contamination plumes of these chlorinated VOCs in the Seoul aquifer. Based on VOCs detected in Seoul, stormwater was mixed with groundwater in combined sewers and flowed into sewage treatment plants. The results imply that organic solvents should be handled with extreme care to protect groundwater quality.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBTEX (benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, xylene) 3aair 3aaquifers 3abenzene 3adechlorination 3aethylbenzene 3agroundwater 3apollutants 3asewage treatment 3asolvents 3astormwater 3atetrachloroethylene 3atoluene 3atrichloroethylene 3avolatile organic compounds 3awater quality 3axylene 3aSouth Korea1 aLee, Pyeong-Koo1 aYun, Seong-Taek1 aHwang, Sang-il,1 aChae, Gitak0 tEnvironmental earth sciences.g2017 May, v. 76, no. 9 p.338-338dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx1866-62807nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12665-017-6666-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02187naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003200111040001800143100002100161245010300182300001800285520090300303592002801206650001601234650002501250650001801275650002201293650003301315650008101348650002901429650002801458650002801486650001401514650003401528700001901562773017801581856004501759852000901804655001201813IND4490777520221119081559.0120602e201206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND449077752DNAL7 a217649842pmid7 a10.1099/ijs.0.035659-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSakamoto, Mitsuo10aBacteroides sartorii is an earlier heterotypic synonym of Bacteroides chinchillae and has priority  ap. 1241-1244.  aStrains of the recently proposed species Bacteroides chinchillae share more than 99.4 % 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity with the type strain of Bacteroides sartorii although these two species do not appear to be similar from their published descriptions.

AFB₁ was found in 19.05% of muscle samples. Despite the values below the limits in feed and the low levels in tissues, results revealed exposure to aflatoxins. Therefore, aflatoxin limits in regulations regarding aquaculture are needed, as well as monitoring of fish feed contamination and aflatoxin residues in edible fish tissues.  aThis work was supported by Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico (CNPq) under grant [number 307391/2016-7].  aPublisher supplied data 3aOreochromis niloticus 3aaquaculture 3afeed contamination 3afish 3afish feeds 3afoods 3aliver 3amuscles 3atechnology 3aBrazil 0aAFB1 0afish farming 0amycotoxins 0aHPLC1 aGomes, Amanda Larissa1 aBurbarelli, Maria Fernanda de Castro1 aBedoya-Serna, Carolina Maria1 aVasquez-Garcia, Andrea1 aChaguri, Milena Penteado1 ade Sousa, Ricardo Luiz Moro1 aFernandes, Andrezza Maria0 tJournal of aquatic food product technology.g2022 Aug. 09, v. 31, no. 7 p.726-734dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl47704x1547-06367nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10498850.2022.20958793Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03681naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245011000168300001300278520253500291592002802826650001602854650002002870650000902890650002602899650001302925650001102938650001302949650001402962650001602976651001802992651002103010700001903031700002103050773011003071856008203181990002303263852000903286655001203295IND60095154020221120161513.0141104e20110601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009515402DNAL7 a10.1016/j.epsl.2011.03.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRadic, Amandine10aIron isotopes in the seawater of the equatorial Pacific Ocean: New constraints for the oceanic iron cycle  ap. 1-10.  aThis study presents the isotopic compositions and concentrations of dissolved and particulate iron from two seawater profiles of the western and central equatorial Pacific Ocean, sampled during the EUCFe cruise. Most of the δ⁵⁶Fe values are positive (relative to IRMM-14), from +0.01 to +0.58‰ in the dissolved fraction (DFe) and from −0.02 to +0.46‰ in the particulate fraction (PFe). The mean measurement uncertainty of ±0.08‰ (2SD) allows the observation of significant variations. Most of the isotope variations occur in the vertical and not in the horizontal direction, implying that each isotope signature is preserved over long distances within a water mass. The thermocline waters of the Papua New Guinea (PNG) area, mostly influenced by sedimentary inputs, display a mean δ⁵⁶DFe value of +0.37‰ (±0.15‰, 2SD). This isotopic signature suggests that the process releasing dissolved iron into the seawater in this area is a non reductive dissolution of sediments (discharged by local rivers and likely re-suspended by strong boundary currents), rather than Dissimilatory Iron Reduction (DIR) within the sediment (characterized by negative δ⁵⁶DFe). These positive δ⁵⁶DFe values seem to be the result of a mean isotopic fractionation of Δ⁵⁶FeDFₑ₋PFₑ=+0.20‰ (±0.11‰, 2SD) produced by the non reductive dissolution. At 0°N, 180°E, the Fe isotope signature of the Equatorial Undercurrent (EUC) waters is identical to that of the PNG station within the range of the uncertainty. This suggests that the dissolved iron feeding the EUC, and ultimately the eastern Pacific high nutrient low chlorophyll area, is of PNG origin, likely released by a non reductive dissolution of terrigenous sediments. Significant Fe removals are observed within the thermocline and the intermediate waters between the PNG and the open ocean stations. The corresponding isotopic fractionations appear to be small, with Δ⁵⁶Feᵣₑₘₒᵥₑd₋SW Fₑ values of −0.30±0.31‰ to −0.18±0.12‰ (2SD) for DFe removal and of −0.10±0.04‰ to −0.05±0.31‰ (2SD) for PFe removal. In the chlorophyll maximum of the open ocean station, the isotopic fractionation associated with biological uptake is estimated at Δ⁵⁶Feₚₕyₜₒ₋DFₑ=−0.25±0.10‰ to -0.13±0.11‰ (2SD). Although these fractionations are based on a limited dataset and need to be further constrained, they appear to be small and to limit the transformations of the iron source signatures within the ocean.  aPublisher supplied data 3achlorophyll 3adata collection 3airon 3aisotope fractionation 3aisotopes 3arivers 3aseawater 3asediments 3auncertainty 3aPacific Ocean 3aPapua New Guinea1 aLacan, Patchi,1 aMurray, James W.0 tEarth and planetary science letters.g2011 June 1, v. 306, no. 1-2 p.1-10dElsevier B.V.x0012-821X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.epsl.2011.03.0153Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle04002naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002800148245023900176300001800415520213700433592002802570650002002598650001502618650001302633650001402646650001802660650002402678650001602702650001702718650002102735650001902756650000902775650001102784650002802795650001002823653002602833653001702859653002702876653002402903700002102927700002802948700002402976700001703000700001403017700002003031700002303051700001903074700002003093700006203113773018103175856008303356852000903439655001203448IND60726708120221119231923.0211127e202106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072670812DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jand.2020.12.0172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDucharme-Smith, Kirstie10aNative Youth Participating in the Together on Diabetes 12-Month Home-Visiting Program Reported Improvements in Alternative Healthy Eating Index-2010 Diet Quality Domains Likely to Be Associated With Blood Pressure and Glycemic Control  ap. 1125-1135.  aThe Together on Diabetes (TOD) intervention was a home-visiting diabetes prevention and management program for Native youth.(1) Examine the impact of the TOD program on diet quality using the Alternative Healthy Eating Index (AHEI-2010); (2) determine association between diet quality and cardiometabolic health.The TOD program was conducted from October 2012 to June 2014 and was evaluated using a pretest-posttest study design from baseline to 12 months. Dietary intake was assessed using a food frequency questionnaire.There were 240 participants between 10 and 19 years of age from 4 reservation-based, rural tribal communities in the southwestern United States that had been diagnosed with T2DM or prediabetes or were identified as at risk based on body mass index and a qualifying laboratory test.Youth were taught a 12-lesson curriculum on goal setting, nutrition, and life skills education.Behavioral and physiologic outcomes related to diabetes.Changes in AHEI-2010 score and associations with cardiometabolic measures were tested, over time, using adjusted longitudinal linear mixed-effects models.The study sample reported an average energy intake of 2016 kcal/d (±1260) and AHEI-2010 score of 47.4 (±7.4) (range: 0-110, higher = better diet quality), indicating low diet quality at baseline. At 12 months’ follow-up, there was a reduction in kilocalories (mean = −346 kcal/d; P < .001), sugar-sweetened beverages (mean = −2 fluid oz/d; P = .032), red/processed meat (mean = −1.5 oz/d; P = .008), and sodium (mean = −650 mg/d; P < .001) but no change in AHEI-2010 score (P = .600). The change in systolic blood pressure from baseline to 12 months for participants within the highest AHEI-2010 quartile group was significantly larger than the change in participants within the lowest quartile group (mean = −5.90 mm Hg; P = .036).Despite stable AHEI-2010 scores during follow-up, there were improvements in diet quality domains likely to be associated with cardiometabolic health. Home-visiting programs like TOD are promising interventions for decreasing dietary intake of poor-quality foods.  aPublisher supplied data 3abody mass index 3acurriculum 3adiabetes 3adietetics 3aenergy intake 3aexperimental design 3afood intake 3afood quality 3aglycemic control 3aprocessed meat 3arisk 3asodium 3asystolic blood pressure 3ayouth 0aNative American youth 0aDiet quality 0aCardiometabolic health 0aDiabetes prevention1 aChambers, Rachel1 aGarcia Larsen, Vanessa,1 aLarzelere, Francene1 aKenney, Anne1 aReid, Ray1 aNelson, Leonela1 aRichards, Jennifer1 aBegay, Marissa1 aBarlow, Allison1 aRosenstock, Summer1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6710-46890 tJournal of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics.g2021 June, v. 121, no. 6 p.1125-1135dElsevier Inc.aAcademy of Nutrition and DieteticswJournal:J000001156x2212-26727nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jand.2020.12.0173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01502naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006500148245011700213300001800330520043100348592002800779596006600807650001600873650001500889650001500904650001100919650001400930700005900944773010601003856008201109852000901191655001201200IND60743388020221119033720.0210707e202107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074338802DNAL7 a10.1007/s00726-021-03017-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSousa, Cristina E.

The structural parameters of these vanes have a significant impact on the separation performance of the AFC. A multi-objective optimization study of guide vanes was conducted using a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model previously proposed by the present authors, support vector machine (SVM), and non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-II (NSGA-II). The obtained Pareto optimal solutions demonstrate that the separation efficiency and pressure drop increase as the number and wrapping angle of the guide vane increase; further, they decrease as the outlet angle and width of the guide vane increase. Moreover, the correlation between the separation efficiency and the pressure drop in the Pareto front was regressed to facilitate the design of the guide vane to achieve the desired separation performance. The research results can provide useful guidance for the design and optimization of AFCs.  aPublisher supplied data 3afluid mechanics 3amodels 3asupport vector machines 0aAxial flow cyclone 0aGuide vane 0aMulti-objective optimization 0aComputational fluid dynamics 0aData-driven surrogate model1 aYu, Bo1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4231-69141 aSun, Dongliang0 tPowder technology.g2020 Aug., v. 373 p.637-646dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11732x0032-59107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.powtec.2020.06.0783Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03077naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002600153245012300179300002000302500001900322520150600341592002801847650004401875650002201919650001401941650001701955650002301972650002001995650001502015650002102030650001502051650001102066650003702077650001202114650001302126650001902139650001402158650002902172650002102201650003702222700006802259700006102327773012302388856008702511852000902598655001202607IND60713671220221118065052.0201023e20200914xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071367122DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.energyfuels.0c022872doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMadhura, T.

Here, we report the preparation of a nanocomposite material consisting of different weight percentages of reduced graphene oxide-supported (5, 10, and 20 wt %) cobalt oxide nanoparticles (rGO–Co₃O₄). The corresponding modified electrodes exhibited bifunctional electrocatalytic behavior toward both glucose oxidation and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). The rGO–Co₃O₄ nanocomposite material is prepared and characterized by thermogravimetry analysis, X-ray diffraction, diffuse reflectance spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, selected area electron diffraction, the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller method, the Barret–Joyner–Halenda method, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, and electrochemical analysis. Among different weight percentages of rGO, 10 wt % GO in the rGO–Co₃O₄ nanocomposite-modified electrode shows stable electrooxidation of glucose with a rapid response time of 1 s with a 0.4 μM limit of detection and a 1008 μA mM–¹ cm–² sensitivity. In addition, rGO–Co₃O₄ (10 wt % GO)-modified electrodes show less negative potential with a large kinetic current and better catalytic durability for ORR. Thus, rGO–Co₃O₄ (10 wt % GO) is employed as a bifunctional catalyst in cost-effective GFCs and obtains a power density output of 0.7319 mW cm–².  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3acatalysts 3acobalt oxide 3acost effectiveness 3adetection limit 3adurability 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3aenergy 3aenergy-dispersive X-ray analysis 3aglucose 3agraphene 3ananocomposites 3aoxidation 3areflectance spectroscopy 3athermogravimetry 3atransmission electron microscopy1 aGnana Kumar, Georgepeter1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7011-34981 aRamaraj, Ramasamy1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2242-54830 tEnergy & fuels.g2020 Sept. 14, v. 34, no. 10 p.12984-12994dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23338x1520-50297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.energyfuels.0c022873Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02344naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003600111040001800147100002300165245003800188300001600226520094200242592002801184650001901212650000901231650001301240650002101253650001401274650001101288650001501299650001301314650001601327650001201343650005401355650002801409650000901437650002001446650005401466650000901520700002001529700002301549700002001572700002301592700002301615773013201638852000901770856008301779655001201862IND4477118320221119193703.0181016e200303  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447711832DNAL7 a126617292pmid7 a10.1177/1040638703015002132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGhisleni, Gabriele10aPulmonary Carcinosarcoma in a Cat  ap. 170-173.  aA Domestic Shorthaired cat was presented with coughing and severe respiratory distress. Thoracic radiographs revealed a lobar mass and numerous additional cavitated intrapulmonary masses. The cat was euthanized and submitted for necropsy. Histological examination of the large mass revealed 2 distinct neoplastic components consisting of bronchial adenocarcinoma admixed with neoplastic areas composed of highly atypical undifferentiated spindle cells (sarcomatous component). Simultaneous expression of vimentin and cytokeratin by a subpopulation of neoplastic epithelial cells and by rare neoplastic spindle cells was identified. On the basis of histology and immunohistochemical results, a diagnosis of primary pulmonary carcinosarcoma with intrapulmonary epithelial metastases was made. Pulmonary carcinosarcoma is a well-known pathological entity in humans.

The present study was conducted to evaluate the effect of drip lateral lengths and system operating pressures on water and fertilizer application uniformity at the Indian Agricultural Research Institute (IARI), New Delhi, India. The following parameters of nutrients and water were studied to design and evaluate the performance of drip irrigation systems: (i) uniformity coefficient; (ii) discharge variation; (iii) distribution uniformity; (iv) statistical uniformity. Drip‐line lengths and system operating pressures (P < 0.05 and P < 0.01) significantly affect the different parameters of fertilizer and water application. The highest values of uniformity coefficient (99.2%), statistical uniformity (99.2%) and distribution uniformity (97.4%) for irrigation water were observed at a pressure of 1.5 kg cm⁻² with a 25 m long drip‐line. Lower values of discharge variation (2.65%) and coefficient of variation (0.04) were observed at the same operating pressure (1.5 kg cm⁻²) and drip‐line length. However, the lowest value of the uniformity coefficient (88.1%), statistical uniformity (93.7%) and distribution uniformity (93.2%) for irrigation water were recorded at 0.5 kg cm⁻² pressure with a 100 m long drip‐line length. The highest values of urea, potassium and phosphorus distribution uniformity were found to be 97.8, 97.1 and 98.2%, respectively, at 1.5 kg cm⁻² pressure with 25 m long drip‐line, and lower values of urea, potassium and phosphorus distribution uniformity (93.1, 92.6 and 93.2%, respectively) were recorded at 0.5 kg cm⁻² pressure with a 100 m long drip‐line. Water and fertilizer distribution uniformity decreased with increase in drip‐line length, and increased with increase in system operating pressure.

As a prerequisite of ecosystem stability facing climate changes of uncertain predictions, the reforestation management promoting locally adapted resources of broad genetic diversity should be prioritized, especially in nature conservation areas. In our case study carried out in the national park, Krkonoše Mountains (the Giant Mountains, the Czech Republic), we demonstrated a tree breeding strategy aiming at maximizing genetic diversity. More than four hundred unique Norway spruce accessions were genotyped on 15 microsatellite loci (Nₑ = 5.764, I = 1.713 and Hₑ = 0.685). Two core collection selection approaches were proposed to establish a new deployment population providing local gene sources of high genetic diversity. Namely, the Core Hunter selection algorithm, with average entry-to-nearest-entry distance (EN) optimization, was applied to identify the most diverse core collection set with the highest genetic diversity parameters obtained for 57 selected individuals (Nₑ = 6.507, I = 1.807, and Hₑ = 0.731). The latter core collection method proposed is innovative, based on choosing appropriate genotypes from a clustered heatmap. For simplicity, we demonstrated the principle of selection strategy on a reduced dataset. It is vital to promote panmixia of a newly established production population from a core collection to complete the conservation breeding effort. Thus, we demonstrated the utilization of the Optimum Neighborhood Algorithm (ONA) deployment that outperformed other deployment algorithms, especially in the case of balanced clone representation and uneven shapes of planting plots. We believe that the case study presented can be generalized and considered as a guideline for analogical tree breeding intentions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPicea abies 3aalgorithms 3abark beetles 3acase studies 3aclimate 3adata collection 3aecological balance 3aforest trees 3aforests 3agenes 3agenetic variation 3agenotyping 3aguidelines 3amicrosatellite repeats 3anational parks 3areforestation 3aCzech Republic1 aDvořák, Jakub 1 aKorecký, Jiří 0 tForests.g2022 Mar. 21, v. 13, no. 3dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2257x1999-49077nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/f130304893Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03596naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006500148245019300213300001800406520180400424592002802228650002502256650002802281650001302309650001702322650002602339650001602365650001202381650002602393650001602419650002002435650001302455650001602468650001202484650001002496650002002506650001602526650001402542650001702556650001702573650001802590650001602608650000902624650002502633700002302658700002202681700002402703700002302727700002202750700002502772700002402797773010602821856008202927852000903009655001203018IND60743388220221119033733.0210707e202107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074338822DNAL7 a10.1007/s00726-021-03021-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aErukainure, Ochuko L.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0489-338X12aL-leucine stimulation of glucose uptake and utilization involves modulation of glucose – lipid metabolic switch and improved bioenergetic homeostasis in isolated rat psoas muscle ex vivo  ap. 1135-1151.  aThe antidiabetic effect of l-leucine has been attributed to its modulatory effect on glucose uptake and lipid metabolism in muscles. However, there is a dearth on its effect on glucose metabolism in muscles. Thus, the present study investigated the effect of l-leucine – stimulated glucose uptake on glucose metabolism, dysregulated lipid metabolic pathways, redox and bioenergetic homeostasis, and proteolysis in isolated psoas muscle from Sprague Dawley male rats. Isolated psoas muscles were incubated with l-leucine (30–240 μg/mL) in the presence of 11.1 mMol glucose at 37 ˚C for 2 h. Muscles incubated in only glucose served as the control, while muscles not incubated in l-leucine and/or glucose served as the normal control. Metformin (6.04 mM) was used as the standard antidiabetic drug. Incubation with l-leucine caused a significant increase in muscle glucose uptake, with an elevation of glutathione levels, superoxide dismutase, catalase, E-NTPDase and 5’nucleotidase activities. It also led to the depletion of malondialdehyde and nitric oxide levels, ATPase, chymotrypsin, acetylcholinesterase, glycogen phosphorylase, glucose-6-phosphatase, fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase and lipase activities. There was an alteration in lipid metabolites, with concomitant activation of glycerolipid metabolism, fatty acid metabolism, and fatty acid elongation in mitochondria in the glucose-incubated muscle (negative control). Incubation with l-leucine reversed these alterations, and concomitantly deactivated the pathways. These results indicate that l-leucine-enhanced muscle glucose uptake involves improved redox and bioenergetic homeostasis, with concomitant suppressed proteolytic, glycogenolytic and gluconeogenetic activities, while modulating glucose – lipid metabolic switch.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetylcholinesterase 3aadenosinetriphosphatase 3acatalase 3achymotrypsin 3afatty acid metabolism 3afatty acids 3aglucose 3aglucose-6-phosphatase 3aglutathione 3aglycemic effect 3aglycogen 3ahomeostasis 3aleucine 3amales 3amalondialdehyde 3ametabolites 3ametformin 3amitochondria 3anitric oxide 3aphosphorylase 3aproteolysis 3arats 3asuperoxide dismutase1 aSalau, Veronica F.1 aAtolani, Olubunmi1 aRavichandran, Rahul1 aBanerjee, Priyanka1 aPreissner, Robert1 aKoorbanally, Neil A.1 aIslam, Md.

We report new trace element (106 samples) and Sr, Nd and Pb (double spike) isotope data from 72 ridge axis samples and 9 off-axis seamount samples between 5 and 11°S, as well as U–Th–Ra disequilibria data for the seamounts. The U-series data constrain the age of one sample from Seamount D, furthest (120km) east of the shallowest part of the ridge, to be <10,000yrs old and the samples from the other three seamounts closer to the ridge to be younger than 240,000yrs. As can be most clearly discerned on a diagram of ²⁰⁸Pb/²⁰⁶Pb vs. ¹⁴³Nd/¹⁴⁴Nd, at least four distinct components are required to explain the geochemical variations along the ridge: 1) a common depleted (D-MORB-like) component in samples near and north of the Ascension Fracture Zone (4.8–7.6°S), representing the most depleted compositions sampled thus far along the mid-Atlantic ridge, 2) an enriched component upwelling beneath Ascension Island and the northern A1 ridge segment (segment numbers increase from A1 to A4 going south from the Ascension Fracture Zone), 3) an enriched component upwelling beneath the A2 ridge segment, and 4) an enriched component upwelling beneath the line of seamounts east of the A3 segment and the A3 and A4 segments. The A1 and the A3+A4 segment lavas form well-defined mixing arrays, which extend from Ascension Island and the A3 seamounts respectively to the depleted D-MORB component, interpreted to reflect local ambient mantle. We propose that the enriched components represent different packages of subducted ocean crust and/or ocean island basalt (OIB) type volcanic islands and seamounts that have either been recycled through 1) the shallow mantle, upwelling passively beneath the ridge system or 2) the deep mantle via an actively upwelling heterogeneous mantle plume that interacts with the ridge system.  aPublisher supplied data 3abasalt 3aislands 3aisotopes 3alava 3alead 3amixing 3astrontium 3avolcanic activity 3aAscension1 aHauff, Folkmar1 aKokfelt, Thomas F.1 aHaase, Karsten1 aGarbe-Schönberg, Dieter1 aWerner, Reinhard0 tEarth and planetary science letters.g2011 June 1, v. 306, no. 1-2 p.86-97dElsevier B.V.x0012-821X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.epsl.2011.03.0323Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03790naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002300148245011500171300001800286520172400304592002802028596007302056596008302129596008302212596008302295596008702378650001602465650001102481650001502492650001202507650001302519650001602532650000902548650001802557650001602575650001502591650002302606650001502629650001102644650001502655650002202670650002102692650001202713650002802725650001402753650002002767650001502787700002802802700002402830700002202854700002902876700002302905700006302928773010602991856008203097852000903179655001203188IND60743388320221119033828.0210707e202107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074338832DNAL7 a10.1007/s00726-021-03019-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZanandrea, Rodrigo10aPaternal exposure to excessive methionine altered behavior and neurochemical activities in zebrafish offspring  ap. 1153-1167.  aAn increase in plasma L-methionine (Met) levels, even if transitory, can cause important toxicological alterations in the affected individuals. Met is essential in the regulation of epigenetic mechanisms and its influence on the subsequent generation has been investigated. However, few studies have explored the influence of a temporary increase in Met levels in parents on their offspring. This study evaluated the behavioral and neurochemical effects of parental exposure to high Met concentration (3 mM) in zebrafish offspring. Adult zebrafish were exposed to Met for 7 days, maintained for additional 7 days in tanks that contained only water, and then used for breeding. The offspring obtained from these fish (F1) were tested in this study. During the early stages of offspring development, morphology, heart rate, survival, locomotion, and anxiety-like behavior were assessed. When these animals reached the adult stage, locomotion, anxiety, aggression, social interaction, memory, oxidative stress, and levels of amino acids and neurotransmitters were analyzed. F1 larvae Met group presented an increase in the distance and mean speed when compared to the control group. F1 adult Met group showed decreased anxiety-like behavior and locomotion. An increase in reactive oxygen species was also observed in the F1 adult Met group whereas lipid peroxidation and antioxidant enzymes did not change when compared to the control group. Dopamine, serotonin, glutamate, and glutathione levels were increased in the F1 adult Met group. Taken together, our data show that even a transient increase in Met in parents can cause behavioral and neurochemical changes in the offspring, promoting transgenerational effects.  aPublisher supplied data  a001cCoordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior  a133202/2018-6cConselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico  a304450/2019-7cConselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico  a420695/2018-4cConselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico  a17/2551-0000977-0cFundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado do Rio Grande do Sul 3aDanio rerio 3aadults 3aaggression 3aanxiety 3adopamine 3aepigenetics 3afish 3aglutamic acid 3aglutathione 3aheart rate 3alipid peroxidation 3alocomotion 3amemory 3amethionine 3aneurotransmitters 3aoxidative stress 3aprogeny 3areactive oxygen species 3aserotonin 3asocial behavior 3atoxicology1 aWiprich, Melissa Talita1 aAltenhofen, Stefani1 aRubensam, Gabriel1 ados Santos, Tiago Marcon1 aWyse, Angela T.

The purification and concentration of oocysts present in 190 fecal samples from chickens raised in extensive, semi-intensive and intensive production systems were accomplished by centrifugal flotation in Sheather's solution and were followed by the extraction of genomic DNA. The detection and molecular characterization of Cryptosporidium species and genotypes were performed using three nested polymerase chain reaction (nested PCR) protocols targeting the 18S rRNA gene followed by sequencing of the amplified fragments. Subgenotyping of C. meleagridis was performed using a nested PCR reaction targeting the gp60 gene. Sample identified as Cryptosporidium sp. genetically similar to Cryptosporidium xiaoi and Cryptosporidium bovis by 18S rRNA gene sequencing were further analyzed by nested PCR targeting the actin gene and subsequent sequencing of the amplified fragment. Positive amplification for Cryptosporidium spp. was observed in 12.6% (24/190) of the samples, including C. baileyi (9.8%; 18/190), C. meleagridis (0.5%, 1/190), C. parvum (2.1%; 4/190) and Cryptosporidium sp. (0.5%; 1/190). Subgenotyping of C. meleagridis revealed the presence of the zoonotic subtype IIIgA23G3R1. Sequencing of the 18S rRNA gene and the actin gene fragments revealed a Cryptosporidium genotype in an extensive poultry system genetically related to C. xiaoi and C. bovis. There was no significant difference in the frequency of positive results obtained by the three nested PCR protocols (p > 0.05); additionally, the agreement obtained by Kappa index ranged from substantial (0.70) to almost perfect (0.9).  aPublisher supplied data 3aCryptosporidium bovis 3aDNA 3aactin 3achickens 3afeces 3agenes 3agenetic similarity 3agenotype 3aoocysts 3apolymerase chain reaction 3apoultry production 3aproduction technology 3aribosomal RNA 3asequence analysis 3aBrazil 0aCryptosporidiosis 0aDiagnosis 0aMolecular characterization 0aDomestic chicken 0aBrazil1 aKurahara, Brayan1 aNakamura, Alex Akira1 ada Silva Camargo, Vinícius1 aFerrari, Elis Domingos1 ada Silva, Giane Serafim1 aNagata, Walter Bertequini1 aMeireles, Marcelo Vasconcelos0 tPreventive veterinary medicine.g2018 Mar. 01, v. 151 p.73-78dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl34182x0167-58777nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.prevetmed.2018.01.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02556naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002700151245012100178300001800299520130500317592002801622650001301650650001201663650001801675650001701693650001701710650001401727650001301741650001901754650001501773650001101788653002101799653001601820653002501836653001801861653003101879773015301910856008602063852000902149655001202158IND60786443220221122052504.0220803e20221018xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078644322DNAL7 a10.1080/10643389.2021.19445882doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aÁlvarez-Ayuso, Esther10aStabilization and encapsulation of arsenic-/antimony-bearing mine waste: Overview and outlook of existing techniques  ap. 3720-3752.  aArsenic and antimony are metalloids that exhibit similar geochemical behavior and are often found in the same mineral associations, co-occurring in mine waste derived from ore exploitation. Due to their adverse effects on ecosystems and human health, techniques to limit their release into the environment from mine wastes and the consequent pollution of surrounding areas are of great interest. This review addresses the geochemical behavior of these two metalloids in mining environments and presents an overview of the main strategies used to stabilize or encapsulate As- or Sb-bearing mine waste, highlighting and comparing their shortcomings and advantages. Several approaches have been investigated, including the 1) establishment of surface covers, 2) application of amendments, 3) solidification using cementing or geopolymer, and 4) application of protecting coatings. Several of these methods have exhibited potential for treating As mine waste. However, the weathering state, composition, and final fate of wastes are determining factors affecting treatment effectiveness. Regarding Sb mine waste, only cementation processes have shown some good performance. Further research effort is required to develop effective passivating coatings or stabilization methods to treat these mine wastes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantimony 3aarsenic 3aencapsulation 3ageochemistry 3ahuman health 3apollution 3apolymers 3asolidification 3atechnology 3awastes 0aToxic metalloids 0amine wastes 0ageochemical behavior 0astabilization 0aJörg Rinklebe and Lena Ma0 tCritical reviews in environmental science and technology.g2022 Oct. 18, v. 52, no. 20 p.3720-3752dTaylor & FranciswJournal:12197x1547-65377nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10643389.2021.19445883Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03156naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001600153245013600169300002000305500001900325520175900344592002802103650001902131650001402150650002002164650001102184650001302195650001802208650000902226650001402235650001702249700001602266700001502282700001702297700001502314700001702329700001702346700001602363700005702379700005502436773012302491856008702614852000902701655001202710IND60713671520221118064955.0201023e20200922xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071367152DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.energyfuels.0c023572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXun, Suhang10aFew Layer g-C₃N₄ Dispersed Quaternary Phosphonium Ionic Liquid for Highly Efficient Catalytic Oxidative Desulfurization of Fuel  ap. 12379-12387.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aFunctionalized ionic liquids (ILs) have been considered as efficient catalysts for oxidative desulfurization (ODS), but the further industrial applications are hampered by the poor separability with oil phase after reaction and large dosage. In this work, few-layered graphitic carbon nitride (g-C₃N₄) with high specific surface area was prepared via thermal oxidation and employed as a carrier to construct supported ionic liquid catalyst for ODS. A functional quaternary phosphonium ionic liquid [(C₆H₁₃)₃PC₁₄H₂₉]₃PMo₁₂O₄₀ (abbreviated as C₁₄PPMo) was synthesized and immobilized on g-C₃N₄. Then, the as-prepared samples were characterized by FT-IR, DRS, XRD, N₂ adsorption–desorption isotherm, XPS, SEM, and TEM, systematically. It was found that few layer g-C₃N₄ had a large specific surface area (194.89 m² g–¹), which was conducive to the high dispersion of C₁₄PPMo IL. The obtained support catalyst C₁₄PPMo/g-C₃N₄ exhibited outstanding catalytic ability on the oxidation of dibenzothiophene (DBT), and the desulfurization efficiency could reach 100% with a small dosage of IL under optimal conditions. The oxidative products of DBT and 4,6-dimethyldibenzothiophene (4,6-DMDBT) were the homologous sulfones and proved by GC-MS, and the proposed reaction processes were studied, respectively. Since the supported IL was a heterogeneous catalyst and no additional solvent was added, C₁₄PPMo IL could be separated and repossessed readily after the reaction. Moreover, the recycle ability of C₁₄PPMo/g-C₃N₄ on the oxidation of both DBT and 4,6-DMDBT were investigated simultaneously, and both of the desulfurization activities could still remain above 90% after 6 times cycling.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon nitride 3acatalysts 3adesulfurization 3aenergy 3agraphene 3aionic liquids 3aoils 3aoxidation 3asurface area1 aTi, Qiutong1 aWu, Linlan1 aHe, Minqiang1 aWang, Chao1 aChen, Linlin1 aYang, Wenshu1 aZhu, Linhua1 aZhu, Wenshuai1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1265-47091 aLi, Huaming1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9538-53580 tEnergy & fuels.g2020 Sept. 22, v. 34, no. 10 p.12379-12387dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23338x1520-50297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.energyfuels.0c023573Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02340naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100003200138245010100170300001600271500002000287520113200307592002801439650001101467650001101478650002301489650001301512650001601525650001801541650001901559650000701578650001301585650002801598650001201626650001601638650001001654651000901664700002301673700001801696773012301714856007201837852000901909655001201918IND60588175520221120092310.0180103e201707  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058817552DNAL7 a10.1002/ird.21072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDarzi‐Naftchali, Abdullah10aDiagnosing Drainage Problems in Coastal Areas Using Machine‐Learning and Geostatistical Models  ap. 428-438.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThis study focuses on diagnosing drainage problems in the coastal areas of Iran by using geostatistical methods, support vector machines (SVMs) and the adaptive neuro‐fuzzy inference system (ANFIS). Groundwater level (WD) and quality were monitored at 37 shallow wells scattered over a 25 000 ha area at different times. Using prepared raster maps of pH, ESP, EC and WD by the best method, drainage problems were categorized into eight classes. Both SVM and ANFIS models significantly improved predicted data for pH, ESP, EC and WD compared with geostatistical models, while SVMs provided slightly better results which were used for further analysis. More than 60% of the area needs drainage to lower the groundwater table in pre‐planting and post‐harvest periods, while during the growing seasons, more than about 72% of the area requires drainage for salinity control. Based on the results, identifying drainage problems at basin scale is possible with cost‐efficient machine learning models with minimum time and data requirements and investment for detailed field surveys.

This was achieved by carrying out a detailed time series assessment of the phytoplankton community composition and nutritional components (carbohydrates, crude protein and lipids) from July 2008 to October 2009 on a weekly basis for each lake. Lesser Flamingos were estimated visually from the lake shore of the sampling sites. In Lake Nakuru, Lesser Flamingos had a significant positive relationship with lipids and Arthrospira biomass but a negative relationship with small cyanoprokaryotes. For Lake Bogoria, no significant differences were observed as the Arthrospira was available throughout the sampling period though the flamingo numbers still fluctuated. We concluded that the nutritional composition and quality of the phytoplankton community influence the temporal and spatial abundance of Lesser Flamingos although other factors such as the prevailing environmental conditions may take precedence.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArthrospira 3aPhoenicopteridae 3abiomass 3acarbohydrates 3acommunity structure 3acrude protein 3adiet 3aenvironmental factors 3alakes 3alipids 3aphytoplankton 3atime series analysis1 aGruber, Martin1 aOduor, Steve Omondi1 aSchagerl, Michael0 tHydrobiologia.g2013 June, v. 710, no. 1 p.83-93dSpringer-Verlagx0018-81587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-012-1105-1  aDNAL 7aarticle02997naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001500147245009200162300001400254520164300268592002801911650001301939650001301952650002201965650001301987650001702000650001102017650000902028650002002037650001802057650001802075650002002093650001702113650001602130653003102146653001802177653002602195653002602221653001802247700001302265700001602278700001702294700001402311773010002325856008102425852000902506655001202515IND60547165020221121023753.0160903e20150601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054716502DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jes.2014.12.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTang, Ying10aUnraveling the size distributions of surface properties for purple soil and yellow soil  ap. 81-89.  aSoils contain diverse colloidal particles whose properties are pertinent to ecological and human health, whereas few investigations systematically analyze the surface properties of these particles. The objective of this study was to elucidate the surface properties of particles within targeted size ranges (i.e. >10, 1–10, 0.5–1, 0.2–0.5 and <0.2μm) for a purple soil (Entisol) and a yellow soil (Ultisol) using the combined determination method. The mineralogy of corresponding particle-size fractions was determined by X-ray diffraction. We found that up to 80% of the specific surface area and 85% of the surface charge of the entire soil came from colloidal-sized particles (<1μm), and almost half of the specific surface area and surface charge came from the smallest particles (<0.2μm). Vermiculite, illite, montmorillonite and mica dominated in the colloidal-sized particles, of which the smallest particles had the highest proportion of vermiculite and montmorillonite. For a given size fraction, the purple soil had a larger specific surface area, stronger electrostatic field, and higher surface charge than the yellow soil due to differences in mineralogy. Likewise, the differences in surface properties among the various particle-size fractions can also be ascribed to mineralogy. Our results indicated that soil surface properties were essentially determined by the colloidal-sized particles, and the <0.2μm nanoparticles made the largest contribution to soil properties. The composition of clay minerals within the diverse particle-size fractions could fully explain the size distributions of surface properties.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEntisols 3aUltisols 3aX-ray diffraction 3acolloids 3ahuman health 3aillite 3amica 3amontmorillonite 3ananoparticles 3aparticle size 3asoil properties 3asurface area 3avermiculite 0aParticle size distribution 0aSoil colloids 0aSurface charge number 0aSpecific surface area 0aClay minerals1 aLi, Hang1 aLiu, Xinmin1 aZhu, Hualing1 aTian, Rui0 tJournal of Environmental Sciences.g2015 June 01, v. 32 p.81-89dElsevier B.V.x1001-07427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jes.2014.12.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02810naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100005600144245014200200300002000342500001900362520135000381592002801731650002401759650001901783650001301802650001401815650002201829653003901851653001601890653002201906653001401928653002401942700001301966700001701979700001701996700002102013700001802034700001602052700005202068700001502120773014202135856007802277852000902355655001202364IND60733908620221121222616.0210414e20210330xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073390862DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.1c022182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Tingting1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0896-370110aEfficient and Stable Carbon-Based Perovskite Solar Cells via Passivation by a Multifunctional Hydrophobic Molecule with Bidentate Anchors  ap. 16485-16497.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aSurface passivation has demonstrated to be an effective strategy to improve the power conversion efficiency (PCE) and long-term stability of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Passivation treatment can effectively reduce the density of defect states at the surface and grain boundaries of perovskite films. Herein, a passivation agent of 2-amino-5-(trifluoromethyl)pyridine (5-TFMAP) with bidentate groups is applied to passivate perovskite CH₃NH₃PbI₃ films for the first time. Two types of electron-rich nitrogen atoms from both the pyridine ring and the amino group provide strong interaction with the under-coordinated Pb²⁺. Additionally, the trifluoromethyl group offers a hydrophobic property and improves moisture stability of the as-fabricated PSCs. It is found that the 5-TFMAP passivation layer can effectively reduce the defect states, promote better carrier transport, and suppress non-radiation recombination of the perovskite films. The best PCE of carbon-based PSCs passivated by the 5-TFMAP agent achieves a high efficiency of 14.96% compared with that of 11.90% for the control PSCs. Moreover, the long-term stability of PSCs with the 5-TFMAP passivation treatment is greatly improved, and its PCE can maintain 80% of its original PCE after being stored for 1200 h with a relative humidity of around 35% at room temperature.  aPublisher supplied data 3aambient temperature 3ahydrophobicity 3anitrogen 3apyridines 3arelative humidity 0acarbon-based perovskite solar cell 0apassivation 0abidentate anchors 0ainterface 0along-term stability1 aZou, Kai1 aLv, Shaoshen1 aTang, Hebing1 aZhang, Yingxiang1 aChen, Yonghua1 aChen, Lixin1 aLi, Zhen1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1177-28181 aHuang, Wei0 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2021 Mar. 30, v. 13, no. 14 p.16485-16497dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.1c022183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03333naa a2200985 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245007300169300001600242520106800258592002801326650001701354650001001371650001601381650002101397650002001418650001101438650001301449650000901462650002401471650001801495650002101513650001701534653000801551653000901559653000801568653000901576653000801585653000901593653000901602653000901611653000901620653000801629653000801637653000801645653000801653653000901661653000901670653000801679653000801687653000801695653001501703653000701718653000801725653000901733653000701742653001501749653000801764653000801772653000901780653000901789653000801798653001101806653001001817653000701827653001001834653000901844653000701853653000901860653000901869653000901878653000901887653000701896653000701903653002001910653001301930653001201943653001401955653002501969653002301994653002202017653002102039653001902060700002002079700002102099700002702120773009802147856008102245852000902326655001202335IND60606304920221121032149.0180725e20160115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060630492DNAL7 a10.1016/j.lfs.2015.12.0432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRameshrad, Maryam10aRat aorta as a pharmacological tool for in vitro and in vivo studies  ap. 190-204.  aRat aorta assay provides a low cost and rapid platform, especially for preclinical in vivo models.

The rat aorta is used for angiogenesis modeling to integrate the benefits of the both in vivo and in vitro models. These explain the importance and usage of rat aorta in researches.Furthermore, about 4503 articles have been published with the key word “rat aorta” in title or abstract from 1955 until the end of 2013 in Medline. In this review, these articles were organized into two main categories: in vivo and in vitro studies. The in vitro section focused on the rat aorta model, as a tool for evaluate the mechanism of vasodilation, vasoconstriction and angiogenesis. In the in vivo section, the most important usage of this tissue was evaluated. Also, the vasotonic signaling pathways in the vessel are explained briefly and some rat aorta applications in vitro and in vivo have been discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aangiogenesis 3aaorta 3aendothelium 3ain vitro studies 3ain vivo studies 3amodels 3amyocytes 3arats 3asignal transduction 3asmooth muscle 3avasoconstriction 3avasodilation 0aBH4 0acGMP 0aCOX 0acNOS 0aDAG 0aDMEM 0aeNOS 0aEDHF 0aEGTA 0aETB 0aETA 0aFBS 0a5HT 0aiNOS 0aIP3R 0aIP3 0aIHC 0aKIR 0aMAP kinase 0aNO 0aNOS 0anNOS 0aPG 0aPI3-kinase 0aPKG 0aPKC 0aROCC 0aRyRs 0aROS 0aRT-PCR 0aRASMC 0asG 0aSERCA 0aSKCa 0aSR 0aTXA2 0atNOS 0aVSMC 0aVOCC 0aVP 0aVC 0aVascular tissue 0aIn vitro 0aIn vivo 0aRat aorta 0aPharmacological tool 0aSignaling pathways 0aVascular response 0aVasoconstriction 0aVasorelaxation1 aBabaei, Hossein1 aAzarmi, Yadollah1 aFouladi, Daniel Fadaei0 tLife sciences.g2016 Jan. 15, v. 145 p.190-204dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11720x0024-32057nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lfs.2015.12.0433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02799naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100002800141245009400169520129700263592002801560650001901588650002001607650002201627650001501649650001201664650001101676650001201687650001101699650002001710650001001730650001201740650001401752650001401766650001101780650001501791650001401806650000901820650002001829650001501849650001201864650001801876650001701894650001001911651001701921700003901938700002201977700002401999700003102023773011902054856007502173852000902248655001202257IND60715295220221118010030.0201026e20200929xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071529522DNAL7 a10.3390/land91003612doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiebenberg, W. Adriaan,10aExtent of Soil Acidity in No-Tillage Systems in the Western Cape Province of South Africa  aRoughly 90% of farmers in the Western Cape Province of South Africa have converted to no-tillage systems to improve the efficiency of crop production. Implementation of no-tillage restricts the mixing of soil amendments, such as limestone, into soil. Stratification of nutrients and pH is expected. A soil survey was conducted to determine the extent and geographical spread of acid soils and pH stratification throughout the Western Cape. Soil samples (n = 653) were taken at three depths (0–5, 5–15, 15–30 cm) from no-tillage fields. Differential responses (p ≤ 0.05) between the two regions (Swartland and southern Cape), as well as soil depth, and annual rainfall influenced (p ≤ 0.05) exchangeable acidity, Ca and Mg, pH₍KCₗ₎, and acid saturation. A large portion (19.3%) of soils (specifically in the Swartland region) had at least one depth increment with pH₍KCₗ₎ ≤ 5.0, which is suboptimal for wheat (Triticum aestivum), barley (Hordeum vulgare), and canola (Brassica napus). Acid saturation in the 5–15 cm depth increment in the Swartland was above the 8% threshold for production of most crops.

This is because of their safe nature, low cost, and good mechanical characteristics. However, conventional hydrogel electrolytes face limitation at subzero temperatures. Herein, we report an antifreezing, safe, and nontoxic gel electrolyte based on the poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA)/Zn/ethylene glycol system. The optimal gel electrolyte membrane exhibits a high ionic conductivity (15.03 mS cm–¹ at room temperature) and promising antifreezing performance (9.05 mS cm–¹ at −20 °C and 3.53 mS cm–¹ at −40 °C). Moreover, the antifreezing gel electrolyte can suppress the growth of Zn dendrites to display a uniform Zn plating/stripping behavior. Also, a flexible antifreezing Zn-ion hybrid supercapacitor fabricated with the optimum antifreezing gel electrolyte membrane exhibits excellent electrochemical properties. The supercapacitor possesses a high specific capacity of 247.7 F g–¹ at room temperature under a high working voltage of 2 V. It also displays an outstanding cyclic stability at room temperature. Moreover, the supercapacitor shows an extraordinary electrochemical behavior and cyclic stability over up to 30 000 cycles at −20 °C under a current load of 5 A g–¹, demonstrating its outstanding low-temperature electrochemical performance. Besides, the antifreezing supercapacitor device also offers high flexibility under different deformation conditions. Therefore, it is believed that this work provides a simplistic method of realizing the application of flexible antifreezing Zn-ion energy storage devices in a subzero-temperature environment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aambient temperature 3adeformation 3aelectric potential difference 3aelectrochemical capacitors 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrolytes 3aelectronics 3aethylene glycol 3aface 3agraphene 3ahydrogels 0aantifreezing gel electrolyte 0agraphene electrode 0aZn-ion hybrid supercapacitor 0alow-temperature performance 0aelectrochemical properties1 aKhanam, Zeba1 aAhmad, Sultan,1 aWang, Ting1 aWang, Hengtai1 aSong, Shenhua1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8523-57380 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2021 Apr. 01, v. 13, no. 14 p.16454-16468dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.1c022423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03820naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100003000164245016400194300001600358520182900374592002802203650002202231650002302253650001902276650001602295650002502311650001102336650000902347650001702356650002402373650000902397650001202406650008302418650003702501650003202538650004002570650002402610650004102634650000902675650001402684650000902698650002502707650003102732650001702763650007602780650001302856651001102869700002902880700002102909700002102930700002702951700003802978773011203016856008103128852000903209655001203218IND4479514720221119161130.0141111e20120830xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447951472DNAL7 a227281682pmid7 a10.1016/j.jep.2012.06.0212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTaciany Bonassoli, Vivian10aSubchronic administration of Trichilia catigua ethyl-acetate fraction promotes antidepressant-like effects and increases hippocampal cell proliferation in mice  ap. 179-184.  aETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Trichilia catigua preparations have been popularly used in Brazil as a tonic for the treatment of fatigue, stress, impotence, and memory deficits. We recently demonstrated an antidepressant-like effect of acute administration of the Trichilia catigua ethyl-acetate fraction (EAF) in mice. The aim of the present study was to evaluate whether subchronic Trichilia catigua EAF administration maintains its antidepressant-like effects and whether these effects are related to hippocampal neurogenesis. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Trichilia catigua EAF (200 and 400mg/kg) was orally administered to mice for 14 day. The animals were tested in the forced swim test (FST) or tail suspension test (TST). After behavioral testing, the animals received bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU; 200mg/kg, i.p.) and were euthanized 24h, 7 day, or 15 day later. The brains were assayed for BrdU and doublecortin (DCX) immunohistochemistry to detect cell proliferation/survival and neurogenesis, respectively. RESULTS: Subchronic administration of 400mg/kg Trichilia catigua EAF promoted antidepressant-like effects in mice in both the FST and TST. The antidepressant-like effect was accompanied by an increase in cell proliferation in the dentate gyrus (DG) of the hippocampus 24h after the treatments were discontinued. This proliferative effect, however, did not influence cell survival or neurogenesis because no change in the number of BrdU- or DCX-positive cells was detected 7 or 15 day after the last EAF administration compared with controls. CONCLUSIONS: Trichilia catigua EAF produced antidepressant-like effects and induced hippocampal cell proliferation in mice. The results contribute information on the pharmacological and molecular mechanisms involved in the antidepressant-like effect of Trichilia catigua EAF.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTrichilia catigua 3acell proliferation 3acell viability 3ahippocampus 3aimmunohistochemistry 3amemory 3amice 3aneurogenesis 3aoral administration 3atail 2aAnimals 2aAntidepressive Agentsxadministration & dosagexpharmacologyxtherapeutic use. 2aCell Proliferationxdrug effects 2aCell Survivalxdrug effects 2aDepressionxdrug therapyxetiology. 2aHindlimb Suspension 2aHippocampusxcytologyxdrug effects. 2aMale 2aMeliaceae 2aMice 2aMice, Inbred Strains 2aNeurogenesisxdrug effects 2aPhytotherapy 2aPlant Extractsxadministration & dosagexpharmacologyxtherapeutic use. 2aSwimming 3aBrazil1 aMicheli Chassot, Janaine1 aLonghini, Renata1 aMilani, Humberto1 aMello, João Carlos P.1 ade Oliveira, Rúbia Maria Weffort0 tJournal of ethnopharmacology.g2012 Aug. 30, v. 143, no. 1 p.179-184dElsevier Ireland Ltdx0378-87417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jep.2012.06.0213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02059naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001500148245004900163300001600212520099700228592002801225650002901253650004301282650001901325650002001344653001001364653002501374653002401399653001501423653002001438700001801458700001801476700001601494773009601510856008201606852000901688655001201697IND60558450020221122054203.0170606e201701  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055845002DNAL7 a10.1016/j.trac.2016.10.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTang, Feng10aHydrophilic materials in sample pretreatment  ap. 172-184.  aSample pretreatment is a fundamental and essential step in almost all analytical procedures, especially for the analysis of biological and environmental samples with complex matrix.

We initiated a field experiment with four treatments: ambient conditions (CKs), CO2 concentration elevated to ~ 500μmol/mol (FACE), temperature elevated by ca. 2°C (T) and combined elevation of CO2 concentration and temperature (FACE+T). A multilevel sampling probe was designed to collect the soil gas at four different depths, namely, 7cm, 15cm, 30cm and 50cm. Methane concentrations were higher during the rice season and decreased with depth, while lower during the wheat season and increased with depth. Compared to CK, mean methane concentration was increased by 42%, 57% and 71% under the FACE, FACE+T and T treatments, respectively, at the 7cm depth during the rice season (p<0.05). Mean methane diffusion effluxes to the 7cm depth were positive in the rice season and negative in the wheat season, resulting in the paddy field being a source and weak sink, respectively. Moreover, mean methane diffusion effluxes in the rice season were 0.94, 1.19 and 1.42mgC/(m2·hr) in the FACE, FACE+T and T treatments, respectively, being clearly higher than that in the CK. The results indicated that elevated atmospheric CO2 concentration and temperature could significantly increase soil profile methane concentrations and their effluxes from a rice–wheat field annual rotation ecosystem (p<0.05).  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon dioxide 3aclimate change 3aecosystems 3afield experimentation 3afree air carbon dioxide enrichment 3amethane 3apaddies 3arice 3asoil air 3asoil profiles 3asoil temperature 3awheat 3aChina 0aPaddy field 0aT-FACE 0aClimate change 0aCH4 concentration 0aSoil profile 0aDiffusion efflux1 aChen, Zhaozhi1 aZhang, Man1 aZhang, Heng1 aZhang, Xuhui1 aPan, Genxing1 aZou, Jianwen1 aXiong, Zhengqin0 tJournal of Environmental Sciences.g2015 June 01, v. 32 p.62-71dElsevier B.V.x1001-07427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jes.2014.11.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02432naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100002400141245012200165520127000287592002801557650001701585650001101602650002201613650003501635650001901670650002001689650001201709650002301721650003301744650001901777651001001796700003301806700002801839773011901867856007501986852000902061655001202070IND60715295320221118010044.0201026e20200930xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071529532DNAL7 a10.3390/land91003622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCorrea-Parra, Juan 10aTowards a Walkable City: Principal Component Analysis for Defining Sub-Centralities in the Santiago Metropolitan Area  aThis article presents a methodology for evaluating the potential for an urban area to become a 15-min city based on its existing essential urban functions. To elaborate this methodology, the research focused on the Metropolitan Area of Santiago de Chile, by identifying 28 urban functions and applying principal component analysis to review how these georeferenced variables are grouped into synthetic components that illustrate the walkability of each block concerning access to these functions. Variables are mapped by GIS software to review where concentrations of essential urban functions occur and where there is a need to increase availability of these missing uses. One of the findings of this study in the Metropolitan Area of Santiago is that essential urban functions provided by the state present a relatively equitable distribution in the metropolis. In contrast, essential urban functions provided by the market are highly concentrated in specific clusters, segregating walkability areas in the metropolitan space. The methodology presented here is replicable for other cities, and the findings offer a critical perspective on land management and urban planning for this case study, where normative frameworks must change to implement the 15-min city.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase studies 3acities 3acomputer software 3ageographic information systems 3ageoreferencing 3aland management 3amarkets 3ametropolitan areas 3aprincipal component analysis 3aurban planning 3aChile1 aVergara Perucich, Francisco,1 aAguirre-Nuñez, Carlos,0 tLand.g2020 Sept. 30, v. 9, no. 10dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21555x2073-445X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/land91003623Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03555naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003900113040001800152100002200170245008800192300001600280520177400296592002802070650001602098650002502114650001002139650001702149650001802166650001602184650001202200650001302212650001902225650001402244650000902258650003702267650001202304650002402316650003902340650003602379650006002415650003702475650002302512650002302535650004102558650002602599653003402625653002702659653001402686653001302700653002502713700001902738700001902757773010602776856008602882852000902968655001202977IND50060400220221119081006.0190318e20130115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006040022DNAL7 a230465242pmid7 a10.1016/j.aquatox.2012.09.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYozzo, Krystle L.10aAdverse outcome pathways during zebrafish embryogenesis: A case study with paraoxon  ap. 346-354.  aUsing paraoxon as a reference acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitor, the objective of this study was to develop an adverse outcome pathway (AOP) that provided quantitative linkages across levels of biological organization during zebrafish embryogenesis. Within normal zebrafish embryos, we first demonstrated that ache transcripts and AChE activity increased in a stage-dependent manner following segmentation. We then showed that static exposure of embryos to paraoxon (31.2–500nM) from 5 to 96hpf resulted in significant stage- and concentration-dependent AChE inhibition, albeit these effects were fully reversible within 48h following transfer to clean water. However, even in the presence of significant AChE inhibition, exposure to non-teratogenic paraoxon concentrations (≤250nM) did not adversely impact secondary motoneuron development at 96hpf. Therefore, we investigated the potential effects of paraoxon exposure on spontaneous tail contractions at 26hpf – an early locomotor behavior that results from innervation of primary (not secondary) motoneuron axons to target axial muscles. Based on these studies, the frequency of spontaneous tail contractions at 26hpf – a developmental stage with minimal AChE expression and activity – was significantly higher following exposure to paraoxon concentrations as low as 31.2nM. Overall, our data suggest that (1) normal AChE activity is not required for secondary motoneuron development and (2) spontaneous tail contractions at 26hpf are sensitive to paraoxon exposure, an effect that may be independent of AChE inhibition. Using a well-studied reference chemical, this study highlights the potential challenges in developing quantitative AOPs to support chemical screening and prioritization strategies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDanio rerio 3aacetylcholinesterase 3aaxons 3acase studies 3aembryogenesis 3ainnervation 3amuscles 3aparaoxon 3aprioritization 3ascreening 3atail 2aAcetylcholinesterasexmetabolism 2aAnimals 2aAxonsxdrug effects 2aEmbryo, Nonmammalianxdrug effects 2aEnzyme Activationxdrug effects 2aGene Expression Regulation, Developmentalxdrug effects 2aMuscle Contractionxdrug effects 2aParaoxonxtoxicity 2aTailxdrug effects 2aWater Pollutants, Chemicalxtoxicity 2aZebrafishxembryology 0aAdverse outcome pathway (AOP) 0aDevelopmental toxicity 0aZebrafish 0aParaoxon 0aSpontaneous behavior1 aMcGee, Sean P.1 aVolz, David C.0 tAquatic toxicology.g2013 Jan. 15, v. 126 p.346-354dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl33163x0166-445X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquatox.2012.09.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02824naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002400139245008500163300001600248500002000264520140000284592002801684650001101712650001201723650002201735650001301757650001701770650001601787650001501803650002001818650001801838650001701856650001701873650002701890650001901917650004301936650005201979650001202031650002902043700001702072700001802089700001902107700001802126773011602144856007302260852000902333655001202342IND60572105720221118011714.0170712e201704  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057210572DNAL7 a10.1111/rda.129502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGarcía Mitacek, MC10aProstaglandin synthesis enzymes' gene transcription in bitches with endometritis  ap. 298-302.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aEndometritis is a major cause of infertility in many domestic species. However, until now the pathogenesis of the endometritis in the bitch is unclear. The aim of this study was to evaluate the gene transcription pattern of prostaglandin (PG) synthesis enzymes (cyclooxygenase [COX2], PTGES‐1 and PGFS) in the endometrium of bitches with or without endometritis. Thirty mixed breed bitches in dioestrus, aged between 1 and 5 years, and weighing between 10 and 30 kg were used. After ovariohysterectomy (OVX), uterine biopsy samples were collected from the middle part of both horns. Then, endometrial epithelium was collected using the cytobrush method and mRNA analysis was performed by real‐time RT‐PCR. Data were analysed with Kruskal–Wallis anova using the sas® software. Uterine condition was identified by endometrial biopsies (normal endometria [n = 11; NE], acute endometritis [n = 10; AE] and chronic endometritis [n = 9; CE]). The COX2, PTGES‐1 and PGFS/AKR1C3 mRNA expression in bitches with and without endometritis was similar. Except for PGFS/AKR1C3, gene transcription of COX2 and PTGES‐1 was significantly increased in AE compared with CE. In addition, COX2 gene transcription was significantly increased in AE compared with NE. In contrast, no differences were found for COX2, PTGES‐1 and PGFS/AKR1C3 mRNA expression in the samples of NE compared with CE.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiopsy 3abitches 3acomputer software 3adiestrus 3aendometritis 3aendometrium 3aepithelium 3agene expression 3amessenger RNA 3amixed breeds 3apathogenesis 3aprostaglandin synthase 3aprostaglandins 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3aspaying 3atranscription (genetics)1 aPraderio, RG1 aStornelli, MC1 ade la Sota, RL1 aStornelli, MA0 tReproduction in domestic animals.g2017 Apr., v. 52 Suppl S2 p.298-302dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx0936-67687nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/rda.129503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01898naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094024002200121024001900143040001800162100002200180245006300202300001800265506007600283520067000359592002801029506003701057650002201094650002001116650001201136650001501148650001101163650001401174650001401188650001401202700002101216700002001237700002101257700002301278773010301301856007501404852000901479655001201488IND60531361120221207123824.0160724e20140729xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053136112DNAL7 a10.1021/bi500744q2doi7 aPMC41161482pmcid7 a250142152pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKamens, Alissa

We report the design and optimization of cyclic peptides as ligands for the EH domain of EHD1. We demonstrate that the improved affinity from cyclization allows fluorescence-based screening applications for EH domain inhibitors. The cyclic peptide is also unusually well-structured in aqueous solution, as demonstrated using nuclear magnetic resonance-based structural models. Because few EH domain inhibitors have been described, these more potent inhibitors will improve our understanding of the roles of EHD1 in the context of cancer invasion and metastasis.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aaqueous solutions 3acyclic peptides 3aligands 3ametastasis 3amodels 3aneoplasms 3areceptors 3ascreening1 aEisert, Robyn J.1 aCorlin, Tiffany1 aBaleja, James D.1 aKritzer, Joshua A.0 tBiochemistry.g2014 July 29, v. 53, no. 29 p.4758-4760dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-49957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fbi500744q3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04125naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245015200171300001600323520243500339592002802774650001702802650001502819650001202834650002202846650001302868650001302881650002302894650001602917650001202933650001902945650001102964650002102975650001302996650000903009650002503018650001003043650001803053650000903071650002703080650001303107650002103120651000903141653001203150653002703162653001503189653001203204653001203216653001603228653000903244700002403253700002103277773014303298856008503441852000903526655001203535IND60561553720221118020927.0190415e201704  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056155372DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chnaes.2016.12.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHamidi, Kordiyeh10aEcological survey of two Calomyscidae species; Goodwin's brush-tailed mouse and Hotson's brush-tailed mouse (Rodentia) in the eastern parts of Iran  ap. 105-114.  aCalomyscus elburzensis and C. hotsoni are two species of the rodents family Calomyscidae which are distributed mainly in Iran. Herein, we evaluated the habitat and ecological differences of these two brush-tailed mice in order to test the credibility of a hypothesis stating that species from habitats with different climates and vegetation show greater intraspecific differentiation than those from areas with more similar climates and vegetation. This study was carried out in four rocky regions in Iran between 2013 and 2015. Totally 52 brush-tailed mice were captured from Kopet-Dag, Khaje-Morad, Ark, and Shadan and Olang during the field studies. Maximum parsimony analysis inferred from mitochondrial DNA sequences (Cytb) was used for species identification, and also comparison of mean Kimura 2-paramater distances was performed. According to the molecular studies, specimens from the first two regions were assigned to C. elburzensis and samples from Ark, and Shadan and Olang belonged to C. hotsoni. The mean distances within all examined Iranian samples of both C. elburzensis and C. hotsoni were 2.3% and 0.9%, respectively. Based on our field studies, C. elburzensis were captured either from “cold mountainous” climate zone with Juniperus excelsa as main vegetation cover or from “Mediterranean” in which Pistacia atlantica is predominant vegetation. C. hotsoni were found in “hot dry desert” and “cold semi-desert” regions both characterized by Ephedra sp. and Avena sativa vegetation cover. Dog rose seeds were the main food of C. elburzensis in Kopet-Dag, whereas brush-tailed mice in the other three regions fed mainly on Mount Atlas pistache fruits. C. elburzensis inhabited concealed rock crevices, but C. hotsoni were found living in burrows which were digged in the soft soils. Individuals of C. hotsoni showed more calm behavior as compared with C. elburzensis. Meriones persicus and Cricetulus migratorius (Rodentia) as well as Ochotona rufescence (Lagomorpha) were the most abundant small mammals encountered with C. elburzensis, while M. persicus was the most successful rodent with sympatric colonies with C. hotsoni. In conclusion, in accordance with the greater genetic distances observed in C. elburzensis populations as compared with C. hotsoni, more significant differences in the habitat structure were also found for the first species in different parts of its distribution range.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAvena sativa 3aCricetulus 3aEphedra 3aJuniperus excelsa 3aMeriones 3aOchotona 3aPistacia atlantica 3aRosa canina 3aburrows 3aclimatic zones 3afruits 3agenetic distance 3ahabitats 3amice 3anucleotide sequences 3aseeds 3asmall mammals 3asoil 3aspecies identification 3asympatry 3avegetation cover 3aIran 0aRodents 0aCalomyscus elburzensis 0aC. hotsoni 0aClimate 0aHabitat 0aFood habits 0aIran1 aDarvīsh, Jamshīd,1 aMatin, Maryam M.0 tActa ecologica Sinica.g2017 Apr., v. 37, no. 2 p.105-114dElsevier B.V.aEcological Society of ChinawJournal:J000000040x1872-20327nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chnaes.2016.12.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02436naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094024002200132024001900154040001800173100001500191245005500206300001400261506007600275520075700351592002801108506003701136650001601173650001801189650001601207650002501223653001601248653001501264653001501279653002501294653002201319653005501341653005101396653005101447653004601498653005301544653005101597700001401648700001801662700001601680700001701696773013501713856008501848852000901933655001201942IND60558450120221207081038.0190318e201609  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055845012DNAL7 a10.1016/j.simyco.2016.11.0012doi7 aPMC51920512pmcid7 a280500542pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, A.J.10aPolyphasic taxonomy of Aspergillus section Cervini  ap. 65-89.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aSpecies belonging to Aspergillus section Cervini are characterised by radiate or short columnar, fawn coloured, uniseriate conidial heads.

Challenges include whether seed dispersal is sufficient for population connectivity, the role of seed banks and problems with studying colonization and extinction in long‐lived and clonal plants. Further, populations often do not occupy discrete habitat patches. Despite these difficulties, we present case studies to illustrate explicit integration of spatial and temporal data in plant ecology. 2. First, on the population level, we focused on two early successional species that lack discrete habitat patches. Multi‐year data sets taken with a grid approach and simple models permit the analysis of landscape dynamics that reflect regional as well as local processes. Using Silene latifolia, we examined colonization. We found evidence for seed dispersal and connectivity among populations across a large landscape. With Helianthus annuus, a species with seed banks, we determined the degree to which landscape‐level patterns of abundance were predicted by local processes (previous year recruitment at a site plus seed banks) vs. seed dispersal. Local processes dominated dynamics. 3. Second, at the community level, we utilized a landscape‐level experiment to examine the influence of environmental gradients and spatial processes (dispersal limitation) on community composition during 18 years of succession. Throughout succession, environmental and spatial factors both contributed significantly to spatial variation in species composition (beta diversity). When connectivity was disrupted, space was the dominant factor underlying beta diversity, and this did not change over time. Across more connected communities, spatial effects diminished over succession as the importance of environmental factors increased, consistent with species‐sorting metacommunity models. 4. Synthesis. Metapopulation/metacommunity concepts emphasize the interaction between space and time in ecological processes. Spatial processes, such as long‐distance dispersal, play a crucial role in creating new populations. Temporal processes, including seed banks, may dominate dynamics at both local and regional scales. The relative importance of spatial vs. temporal processes changes as populations persist and communities assemble over time; these patterns may only emerge after many years. Integrating long‐term data with spatial data is thus essential for understanding spatio‐temporal patterns inherent in metapopulation and metacommunity theories.  aPublisher supplied data 3ainterspecific variation 3aHelianthus annuus 3aSilene latifolia 3acommunity structure 3adata collection 3amodels 3aspace and time 3aenvironmental factors 3aspatial data 3aextinction 3aspecies diversity 3aplant ecology 3acase studies 3ahabitats 3aseed dispersal 0aspecies differences 0arecruitment1 aFoster, Bryan L.1 aBallantyne, Ford, IVcIV1 aCollins, Cathy D.1 aAntonovics, Janis1 aHolt, Robert D.0 tjournal of ecology.g2012 Jan., v. 100, no. 1 p.88-103dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0022-04777nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2745.2011.01917.x  aDNAL 7aarticle03368naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001800139245007200157300001600229500002000245520203000265592002802295650000802323650001602331650002702347650001502374650001502389650000902404650001902413650001402432650001702446650002002463650002102483650001502504650001302519650001702532650003702549650001002586650001102596650001202607650001802619650001602637650001102653650001202664773011602676856007302792852000902865655001202874IND60572105820221118011741.0170712e201704  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057210582DNAL7 a10.1111/rda.128552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChatdarong, K10aRetained fertilizing capability in cryopreserved feline spermatozoa  ap. 261-264.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aSperm cryopreservation offers a long‐term preservation of male genetic materials for future assisted reproductive technologies. However, dramatic changes in temperature during freezing and thawing injure sperm cells. While motility is essential for AI and membrane integrity is crucial for in vitro fertilization (IVF), sperm DNA integrity is a common index of fertilizing capability required for AI, IVF and intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI). In endangered felids died unexpectedly, attempts have been made to recover as many DNA intact spermatozoa as possible from epididymis and testis to increase the opportunity to produce offspring in future. Although sperm from caudal epididymis has shown retained fertilizing capability after freezing and thawing (27.3% conception rate after unilateral intrauterine insemination), sperm recovery from the corpus epididymis has been suggested as an alternative to increase the amount of preserved genetic materials. To improve epididymal sperm quality, pre‐treatment with single‐layer centrifugation resulted in selection of sperm cells with intact DNA while post‐thaw treatment with extracellular ATP incubation promoted the blastocyst rate. Cold storage of domestic cat testis for 7 days at 4°C demonstrated <1% of sperm cells with fragmented DNA. Moreover, isolated testicular sperm cells, stored for 7 days at 4°C, produced after ICSI poorer percentages of cleavage, morula and blastocyst than the fresh control. In wild felids, a death‐to‐necropsy time of 2 hr after a jungle cat (Felis chaus) aged 10 years died during anaesthesia plus another necropsy‐to‐sperm recovery time of 25 hr has been reported to yield the post‐thawed testicular sperm with 22.2% intact DNA. In summary, the chromatin structure of feline ejaculated and epididymal sperm seems to be tolerated to cold storage and cryopreservation; thus, fertilizing capability is well protected. In contrast, the cat testicular sperm DNA is generally damaged through the cryopreservation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aFelis chaus 3aadenosine triphosphate 3aanesthesia 3ablastocyst 3acats 3acentrifugation 3achromatin 3acold storage 3aconception rate 3acryopreservation 3aepididymis 3afreezing 3ainsemination 3aintracytoplasmic sperm injection 3amales 3amorula 3aprogeny 3asperm quality 3atemperature 3atestes 3athawing0 tReproduction in domestic animals.g2017 Apr., v. 52 Suppl S2 p.261-264dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx0936-67687nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/rda.128553Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02340naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100001700137245013400154300001600288520103000304592002801334650002201362650002501384650001301409650001301422650001101435650002201446650002601468651001001494653002001504653001701524653001301541653001801554653002201572653002301594653001301617653002601630700002201656700001801678700001901696773009901715856007101814852000901885655001201894IND60481019320221119191313.0160201s2016    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6048101932DNAL7 a10.1071/MF140382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVásquez, P.10aUV radiation effects on the embryos of anchoveta (Engraulis ringens) and common sardine (Strangomera bentincki) off central Chile  ap. 195-209.  aIt has been proposed that current levels of ultraviolet B (UVB) radiation could cause lethal or sublethal effects on fish embryos located in the upper layers of the water column. Observed levels of UVB off central Chile (36°S, 73°W) indicate that planktonic fish embryos could be exposed to harmful UVB radiation. From July 2011 to January 2012 embryos from anchoveta (Engraulis ringens) and common sardine (Strangomera bentincki) were used to test experimentally whether the UVB levels in central Chile produce lethal or sublethal effects in epipelagic fish embryos. Simultaneously, whether the embryos might be exposed to harmful UVB levels in the field was investigated. Our experimental results show that UVB may cause a decrease in hatching success, changes in buoyancy and embryonic malformations. These results, along with the observed vertical distribution of embryos and UVB radiation levels in the field during late spring suggest that lethal and sublethal effects may be occurring in the embryos of both species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEngraulis ringens 3aabnormal development 3ahatching 3asardines 3aspring 3asublethal effects 3aultraviolet radiation 3aChile 0aembryo buoyancy 0afish embryos 0ahatching 0amalformations 0anatural mortality 0asmall pelagic fish 0asurvival 0avertical distribution1 aLlanos-Rivera, A.1 aCastro, L.

A general decreasing trend of PFASs from the coast areas to the open sea was found. Multivariate regression analysis indicated pH and longitude were the major factors influencing surficial distributions of PFASs in the sampling areas (R2 = 0.29, p < 0.01). Total PFASs concentrations in the sediment cores ranged from <LOD to 1.65 ng g−1 dw, with an increasing trend from the lower to the upper layers, corresponding well to the increasing production and usage in China in recent years.  aPublisher supplied data 3acoasts 3adetection limit 3alongitude 3amarine sediments 3apH 3aperfluorocarbons 3aregression analysis 3aChina 3aEast China Sea 3aYellow Sea 0aPerfluoroalkyl substances 0aMarine sediment 0aSpatial distribution 0aTemporal distribution1 aFu, Jianjie1 aZeng, Lixi1 aLi, An1 aLi, Huijuan1 aZhu, Nali1 aLiu, Runzeng1 aLiu, Aifeng1 aWang, Yawei1 aJiang, Guibin0 tEnvironmental pollution.g2014 Nov., v. 194 p.60-68dElsevier Ltdx0269-74917nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2014.07.0183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03299naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245008500163300001600248520162300264592002801887650001701915650000801932650002501940650001601965650002001981650001202001650003002013650003102043650001002074650003502084650003202119650002202151650002202173650001502195650000902210650001702219650001002236650002202246650001702268650001102285650001202296650001802308650002002326700001202346700001702358700001402375700001102389700001702400700001402417700001402431700001602445700001202461773013402473856008102607852000902688655001202697IND60687103220221121213710.0200325e202003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068710322DNAL7 a10.1134/S10214437200200412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFeng, M. F.10aPhysiological and Transcriptome Analyses of Transgenic FGF21 Immature Rice Seeds  ap. 360-368.  aIn addition to its role as one of the largest staple food crops in the world, rice (Oryza sativa L.) currently serves as an important bioreactor in molecular pharming. Although some studies have been conducted on the effects of foreign protein expression on rice, most of them use mature seeds and focus on proteomic changes. In this study, the effects of fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) transformation on immature rice seeds were studied by means of physiological and transcriptome sequencing method. Starch and sucrose content and their associated enzyme activities of immature seeds were determined. After extracting RNA from immature seeds, Illumina HiSeqᵀᴹ 2500 was used for RNA sequencing. The content of starch and sucrose and activities of related enzymes in transgenic FGF21 immature rice seeds were greater than those of wild type. In total, 1762 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified among non-transgenic wild type (CK) and transgenic lines (T1, T2, and T3). Meanwhile, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis indicated that the top two enriched processes were starch and sucrose metabolism and plant–pathogen interactions. Most DEGs of the plant–pathogen interactions pathway were downregulated, while expression patterns were more complex for DEGs of starch and sucrose metabolic pathways. Ultimately, these results could be used to reveal mechanisms underlying transgenic seed quality changes induced by FGF21 transformation and could also serve as an exploratory study into the use of transcriptome technique for safety evaluation of rice bioreactors.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOryza sativa 3aRNA 3abiochemical pathways 3abioreactors 3aenzyme activity 3aenzymes 3afibroblast growth factors 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3agenetically modified organisms 3ahost-pathogen relationships 3amolecular farming 3aprotein synthesis 3aproteomics 3arice 3aseed quality 3aseeds 3asequence analysis 3astaple crops 3astarch 3asucrose 3atranscriptome 3atranscriptomics1 aCai, H.1 aZhang, L.

Both slit and cylindrical pores are modeled to determine the influence of pore geometry on the electric double layer (EDL) structure and capacitance. Two types of solvents are selected to dilute the ionic liquids in order to establish the effect of solvent polarity. The number of cations, anions, and solvents is chosen to be consistent with their densities in the bulk state. We focus on the structural changes of ionic liquids and their relation to the oscillation in capacitance as a function of varying nanopore size. Structural transitions are analyzed from one layer to two layers and three layers within the confinement of the nanoscale pores. Compared with slit pores, the capacitance oscillates more strongly for cylindrical pores where ions form two peaks instead of combining into a single peak in the middle of the pore. The addition of solvent does not give rise to a larger capacitance despite the solvent’s closer approach to the electrode.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanions 3acapacitance 3acarbon 3acations 3aelectrodes 3ageometry 3aionic liquids 3ananopores 3aphysical chemistry1 aWang, Xuewei1 aForsman, Jan1 aWoodward, Clifford E.0 tThe Journal of Physical Chemistry C.g2017 June 29, v. 121, no. 25 p.13539-13548dAmerican Chemical Societyx1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.jpcc.7b033193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03998naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094024002200133024001900155040001800174100002100192245014000213500001900353506007600372520195900448592002802407506003702435650001502472650002502487650001502512650001402527650001502541650001502556650001402571650002202585650002602607650001502633653002702648653001502675653002002690700002002710700002202730700002102752700001902773700001902792700002502811700002202836700002502858700002202883700002202905700002102927700006002948700006003008700002103068700001903089700005403108700002303162773009303185856008503278852000903363655001203372IND60690756920221207072127.0200508e201804  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069075692DNAL7 a10.1016/j.heliyon.2018.e006062doi7 aPMC59681772pmcid7 a298623672pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLohöfer, Fabian10aMolecular imaging of myocardial infarction with Gadofluorine P – A combined magnetic resonance and mass spectrometry imaging approach  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aMolecular MRI is becoming increasingly important for preclinical research. Validation of targeted gadolinium probes in tissue however has been cumbersome up to now. Novel methodology to assess gadolinium distribution in tissue after in vivo application is therefore needed.To establish combined Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and Mass Spectrometry Imaging (MSI) for improved detection and quantification of Gadofluorine P deposition in scar formation and myocardial remodeling.Animal studies were performed according to institutionally approved protocols. Myocardial infarction was induced by permanent ligation of the left ascending artery (LAD) in C57BL/6J mice. MRI was performed at 7T at 1 week and 6 weeks after myocardial infarction. Gadofluorine P was used for dynamic T₁ mapping of extracellular matrix synthesis during myocardial healing and compared to Gd-DTPA. After in vivo imaging contrast agent concentration as well as distribution in tissue were validated and quantified by spatially resolved Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption Ionization (MALDI) MSI and Laser Ablation – Inductively Coupled Plasma – Mass Spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) imaging.Both Gadofluorine P enhancement as well as local tissue content in the myocardial scar were highest at 15 minutes post injection. R₁ values increased from 1 to 6 weeks after MI (1.62 s⁻¹ vs 2.68 s⁻¹, p = 0.059) paralleled by an increase in Gadofluorine P concentration in the infarct from 0.019 mM at 1 week to 0.028 mM at 6 weeks (p = 0.048), whereas Gd-DTPA enhancement showed no differences (3.95 s⁻¹ vs 3.47 s⁻¹, p = 0.701). MALDI-MSI results were corroborated by elemental LA-ICP-MS of Gadolinium in healthy and infarcted myocardium. Histology confirmed increased extracellular matrix synthesis at 6 weeks compared to 1 week.Adding quantitative MSI to MR imaging enables a quantitative validation of Gadofluorine P distribution in the heart after MI for molecular imaging.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3adesorption 3aextracellular matrix 3agadolinium 3ahistology 3ainfarction 3aionization 3amagnetism 3amass spectrometry 3amyocardial infarction 3amyocardium 0aBiomedical engineering 0aCardiology 0aMedical imaging1 aHoffmann, Laura1 aBuchholz, Rebecca1 aHuber, Katharina1 aGlinzer, Almut1 aKosanke, Katja1 aFeuchtinger, Annette1 aAichler, Michaela1 aFeuerecker, Benedikt1 aKaissis, Georgios1 aRummeny, Ernst J.1 aHöltke, Carsten1 aFaber, Cornelius1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7683-77101 aSchilling, Franz1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5239-46281 aBotnar, René M.1 aWalch, Axel K.1 aKarst, Uwe1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1774-67871 aWildgruber, Moritz0 tHeliyon.g2018 Apr., v. 4, no. 4 p.e00606-dElsevier LtdwJournal:23264x2405-84407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2018.e006063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02839naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100002200137245013900159300001600298520140200314592002801716650001701744650002301761650001101784650002601795650001401821650001701835650003101852650001301883650001001896650002301906650001101929650001501940650001001955653002901965653001201994653002602006653001102032653003102043653001402074700002402088700001502112700002002127700001902147773009902166856007102265852000902336655001202345IND60481019420221119191306.0160201s2016    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6048101942DNAL7 a10.1071/MF140592doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPoulos, Davina E.10aDistribution and spatial modelling of a soft coral habitat in the Port Stephens–Great Lakes Marine Park: implications for management  ap. 256-265.  aHabitat mapping is a useful method for understanding the complex spatial relationships that exist in the marine environment, and is used to evaluate the effectiveness of management strategies, particularly in regards to marine protected areas. This study explored the observed and predicted distribution of an uncommon soft coral species, Dendronephthya australis within the Port Stephens–Great Lakes Marine Park. Dendronephthya australis was mapped by video operated by a SCUBA diver towing a time synchronised GPS. A species distribution model was created to explore the possible occurrence of D. australis outside of the mapped area, using four environmental parameters: bathymetry, slope of seabed, velocity of tidal currents, and distance from estuary mouth. Dendronephthya australis colonies occurred along the southern shoreline in the Port Stephens estuary between Fly Point and Corlette Point, but no colonies were found within sanctuary (no-take) zones within the marine park. The model illustrated limited habitat suitability for D. australis within a larger section of the estuary, suggesting this species has specific environmental requirements survival. Owing to its current threats (anchor damage and fishing line entanglement), implications from these findings will assist future management and protection decisions, particularly in regard to its protection within a marine park.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiogeography 3aconservation areas 3acorals 3aenvironmental factors 3aestuaries 3afishing line 3aglobal positioning systems 3ahabitats 3alakes 3amarine environment 3amodels 3ashorelines 3atides 0aDendronephthya australis 0aestuary 0amarine protected area 0aMaxent 0aspecies distribution model 0atowed-GPS1 aGallen, Christopher1 aDavis, Tom1 aBooth, David J.1 aHarasti, David0 tMarine & freshwater research.g2016, v. 67, no. 2 p.256-265dCSIRO Publishingx1323-16507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1071/MF140593Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03830naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094024002200121024001900143040001800162100001900180245012800199300001600327506007600343520187300419592002802292506003702320650001602357650002002373650002102393650001202414650001102426650002502437650001902462650002402481650002102505650001702526650001902543650001102562650001002573650001202583650001802595650001402613650002002627650002202647650001002669650001402679650001802693650001602711700001502727700002402742700002302766700002302789700002002812700002102832700002302853700002102876700002102897773019202918856007303110852000903183655001203192IND60419323820221207141906.0151002e201510  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6041932382DNAL7 a10.1111/tpj.130002doi7 aPMC47655012pmcid7 a263130102pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMsanne, Joseph10aGlucosylceramides are critical for cell‐type differentiation and organogenesis, but not for cell viability in Arabidopsis  ap. 188-201.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aGlucosylceramides (GlcCer), glucose‐conjugated sphingolipids, are major components of the endomembrane system and plasma membrane in most eukaryotic cells. Yet the quantitative significance and cellular functions of GlcCer are not well characterized in plants and other multi‐organ eukaryotes. To address this, we examined Arabidopsis lines that were lacking or deficient in GlcCer by insertional disruption or by RNA interference (RNAi) suppression of the single gene for GlcCer synthase (GCS, At2g19880), the enzyme that catalyzes GlcCer synthesis. Null mutants for GCS (designated ‘gcs‐1’) were viable as seedlings, albeit strongly reduced in size, and failed to develop beyond the seedling stage. Heterozygous plants harboring the insertion allele exhibited reduced transmission through the male gametophyte. Undifferentiated calli generated from gcs‐1 seedlings and lacking GlcCer proliferated in a manner similar to calli from wild‐type plants. However, gcs‐1 calli, in contrast to wild‐type calli, were unable to develop organs on differentiation media. Consistent with a role for GlcCer in organ‐specific cell differentiation, calli from gcs‐1 mutants formed roots and leaves on media supplemented with the glucosylated sphingosine glucopsychosine, which was readily converted to GlcCer independent of GCS. Underlying these phenotypes, gcs‐1 cells had altered Golgi morphology and fewer cisternae per Golgi apparatus relative to wild‐type cells, indicative of protein trafficking defects. Despite seedling lethality in the null mutant, GCS RNAi suppression lines with ≤2% of wild‐type GlcCer levels were viable and fertile. Collectively, these results indicate that GlcCer are essential for cell‐type differentiation and organogenesis, and plant cells produce amounts of GlcCer in excess of that required for normal development.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aArabidopsis 3aGolgi apparatus 3aRNA interference 3aalleles 3acallus 3acell differentiation 3acell viability 3aendomembrane system 3aeukaryotic cells 3agametophytes 3aheterozygosity 3aleaves 3amales 3amutants 3aorganogenesis 3aphenotype 3aplasma membrane 3aprotein transport 3aroots 3aseedlings 3asphingolipids 3asphingosine1 aChen, Ming1 aLuttgeharm, Kyle D.1 aBradley, Amanda M.1 aMays, Elizabeth S.1 aPaper, Janet M.1 aBoyle, Daniel L.1 aCahoon, Rebecca E.1 aSchrick, Kathrin1 aCahoon, Edgar B.0 tplant journal.g2015 Oct., v. 84, no. 1 p.188-201dBlackwell Scientific Publishers and BIOS Scientific Publishers in association with the Society for Experimental Biologyx0960-74127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/tpj.130003Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01476naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001700145245015900162300001800321520048200339592002800821650001300849650001600862650002300878650001200901650001400913700001800927700002000945773011900965856008101084852000901165655001201174IND60550554620221120133428.0160911e20160603xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055055462DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.joc.6b006842doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Ya-Qiong10aMorita–Baylis–Hillman Reaction of α,β-Unsaturated Ketones with Allylic Acetates by the Combination of Transition-Metal Catalysis and Organomediation  ap. 4429-4433.  aAn intermolecular Morita–Baylis–Hillman (MBH) reaction of α,β-unsaturated ketones with allylic acetates under the catalysis of 10 mol % of tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)palladium(0) and mediation of tributylphosphine has been developed in the presence of acetic acid, affording the desired α-coupling products.

This research explores the geographical movement of metropolitan migration in Melbourne at a disaggregate spatial scale. Several spatially based techniques are employed, from which the complex patterns of migration are identified. The implications of migration movements for urban structure and infrastructure are also examined. This paper then links the migration flows to a spatial housing market analysis, and finds that urban variations in housing utility and housing prices are important factors influencing patterns of migration. In addition, new dwelling development programs generate new vacancy chains which shape residential migration toward outer urban areas. Drawing conclusions from this analysis, our research recommends more effective government approaches to fostering investment in housing-related infrastructure in Australian cities, and it discusses how broader policy and investment can align to drive settlement patterns which optimise productivity and liveability and minimise negative effects.  aPublisher supplied data 3ageography 3ainfrastructure 3aissues and policy 3amarket analysis 0aMetropolitan migration 0aSpatial housing market 0aInfill development1 aShiran, Solmaz Jahed1 aDodson, Jago0 tApplied geography.g2021 Apr., v. 129 p.102414-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11785x0143-62287nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apgeog.2021.1024143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02268naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100001700112245006800129300001800197520117400215592002801389650001701417650002201434650002001456650001901476650002001495650001601515650001501531650001501546650001801561650001801579653003601597653001201633653002001645653001801665700001901683700001801702773015301720852000901873655001201882IND60705747420221123041142.0200807e201506  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070574742DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTathod, D.V.10aHorizontal and Radial Spreading of Water in Soil on Drip System  ap. 3185-3189.  aIndian economy in mainly dependent on agriculture, and water is the major agriculture input for crop production hence irrigation play an importance role in increase crop production.

RESULTS: The cellulase hyper‑producing mutants of LC-M4 and LC-M16 derived from the wild type T. longibrachiatum LC strain through heavy ion mutagenesis exhibited the high-efficiency secretion ability of cellulase and hemicellulose. The FPase activities of LC-M4 (4.51 IU/mL) and LC-M16 (4.16 IU/mL) mutants increased by 46.91% and 35.5% when compared to the LC strain, respectively. Moreover, these two cellulase hyper-producing mutants showed faster growth rate on the cellulosic substrates (Avicel and CMC-Na) plate than that of LC strain. Therefore, an integrative transcriptome and proteome profiling analysis of T. longibrachiatum LC and its cellulase hyper‑producing mutant LC-M4 and LC-M16 were employed to reveal the key genes involved in cellulolytic enzymes regulation. It was showed that the transcriptome and proteome profiles changed dramatically between the wild strain and mutant strains. Notably, the overlapped genes obtained from integrative analysis identified that the protein processing in ER involved in protein secretory pathway, starch and sucrose metabolism pathway and N-glycan biosynthesis pathway were significantly changed both in cellulase hyper-producing mutants and thereby improving the enzyme secretion efficiency, which maybe the main reason of cellulase hyper-production in LC-M4 and LC-M16 mutants. In addition, the three DEGs/DEPs (PDI, Sec61, VIP36) related with protein secretion in ER and two DEGs/DEPs (OST, MOGS) related with N-glycan biosynthesis were identified as key candidate genes participating in enzyme protein biosynthesis and secretion. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, a hypothetical secretory model of cellulase protein in filamentous fungi was established on the basis of DEGs/DEPs and key genes identified from the omics analysis, which were of great guidance on the rational genetic engineering and/or breeding of filamentous fungi for improving cellulase production.  aPublisher supplied data  a12075294cthe National Natural Science Foundation of China  a2020HZ-01cthe Cooperation Project of Gansu Academy of Sciences  aYD-2021-01cthe Local Cooperation Project of the Chinese Academy of Sciences  a202101AE090028cthe Project of Agricultural Science and Technology of Yunnan Province  a21YF5FA138cthe Key Research and Development plan of Gansu Province 3aTrichoderma longibrachiatum 3abiofuels 3abiomass 3abiosynthesis 3abiotechnology 3aendo-1,4-beta-glucanase 3ahemicellulose 3amodels 3amutagenesis 3amutants 3aprotein secretion 3aprotein synthesis 3aproteome 3astarch 3asucrose 3atranscriptome1 aWang, Shuyang1 aXu, Fuqiang1 aXiao, Guoqing1 aBai, Jin1 aWang, Junkai1 aSun, Xisi0 tBiotechnology for biofuels and bioproducts.g2022 Dec., v. 15, no. 1 p.63-63dBioMed CentralwJournal:28570x2731-36547nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13068-022-02161-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03039naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100001500171245016400186300001300350500001500363520145400378592002801832650001401860650000801874650001101882650002401893650002001917650001001937650001201947650003601959650003501995650003402030650005002064650004702114650002002161650001102181650004802192650006902240650000902309650005702318653001602375773011402391856005502505852000902560655001202569IND4478455620221118010017.0120727e201202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447845562DNAL7 a217907422pmid7 a10.1111/j.1439-0264.2011.01097.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKassab, A.10aUltrasonographic and Macroscopic Anatomy of the Enucleated Eyes of the Buffalo (Bos bubalis) and the One‐Humped Camel (Camelus dromedarius) of Different Ages  ap. 7-11.  a2019-12-06  aWith 1 figure and 2 tables SUMMARY: The ultrasonographic appearance and measurements of the normal buffalo and camel eye globes were described in 60 buffaloes (Bos bubalis) aged 1 year (28 eyes) and 10 years (32 eyes), and in 51 humped camels (Camelus dromedarius) aged 1 year (26 eyes) and 10 years (24 eyes). Ocular measurements were recorded by A‐ and B‐scan ultrasonographic examination of 40 buffalo eyes (18 young and 22 adult eyes) and 34 camel eyes (14 young and 20 adult eyes) using a KANGH ultrasound scanner equipped with 10 MHz probe. For gross measurements, 20 buffalo and 16 camel eye globes were frozen and dissected and the same measurements were made using fine callipers macroscopically. The aqueous and vitreous humour of the buffalo and camel eyes appeared anechoic. The cornea, anterior and posterior lens capsule and iris appeared hyperechoic. The ocular measurements for the axial length, vitreous chamber depth (VCD), corneal thickness, lens thickness and scleroretinal rim thickness increase with the advance of age in both buffaloes and camels. Except for the anterior chamber depth, VCD and lens thickness, which were larger in adult camels than in adult buffaloes, no other differences between ocular dimensions were observed in both species. The results of this study are valuable for comparative ocular anatomy and will be useful for ultrasonographic evaluation of ocular diseases in buffaloes and camels.  aPublisher supplied data 3abuffaloes 3aBos 3acornea 3aCamelus dromedarius 3aultrasonography 2aAging 2aAnimals 2aAqueous Humorxultrasonography. 2aBuffaloesxanatomy & histology 2aCamelusxanatomy & histology. 2aCorneaxanatomy & histologyxultrasonography. 2aEyexanatomy & histologyxultrasonography. 2aEye Enucleation 2aFemale 2aIrisxanatomy & histologyxultrasonography. 2aLens Capsule, Crystallinexanatomy & histologyxultrasonography. 2aMale 2aVitreous Bodyxanatomy & histologyxultrasonography. 0adromedaries0 tAnatomia, histologia, embryologia.g2012 Feb., v. 41, no. 1 p.7-11dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0340-20967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1439-0264.2011.01097.x  aDNAL 7aarticle02512naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001600152245012900168300001600297520115200313592002801465650001901493650000901512650002501521650002201546650001101568650001701579650002901596650001101625650001801636653003401654653002201688653002301710653002701733653002901760653003501789700001801824700005401842773009801896856008701994852000902081655001202090IND60610878720221117224531.0200621e20181101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061087872DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apenergy.2018.07.0302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQin, Shiyue10aModeling, thermodynamic and techno-economic analysis of coal-to-liquids process with different entrained flow coal gasifiers  ap. 413-432.  aFor the coal-to-liquids (CTL) plant, the most important unit is gasification, which determines the composition of the crude syngas, and affects CO₂ emissions and investment of the CTL process. This paper conducts a detailed plant-wide modeling of CTL process with different entrained flow gasifiers. The model is compared with the literature data. Three cases of CTL process with different entrained flow gasifiers (GSP, Shell and Texaco) are researched through thermodynamic, techno-economic and CO₂ emissions analysis. Case GSP represents the CTL process with GSP gasifier, Case Shell represents that with Shell gasifier, and Case Texaco represents that with Texaco gasifier. For a typical CTL process, Case GSP can produce FT liquids of 277.49 t/h, Case Shell can produce 246.25 t/h, and Case Texaco can provide 232.93 t/h. The energy efficiencies of Case GSP, Shell and Texaco are 50.85%, 48.18% and 41.09%, respectively. The exergy efficiencies are 49.89%, 47.20% and 40.44%, respectively. The exergy inefficiencies of the subsystem are quantified. The economic performance and CO₂ emissions of the three cases are also discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon dioxide 3acoal 3aeconomic performance 3aenergy efficiency 3aexergy 3agasification 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3amodels 3asynthesis gas 0aCoal-to-liquids (CTL) process 0aCoal gasification 0aProcess simulation 0aThermodynamic analysis 0aTechno-economic analysis 0aFischer-Tropsch (FT) synthesis1 aChang, Shiyan1 aYao, Qiang1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2190-64100 tApplied energy.g2018 Nov. 01, v. 229 p.413-432dElsevier LtdwJournal:11876x0306-26197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2018.07.0303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02109naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245011900169520094400288592002801232650001401260650001601274650001201290650001401302650001001316650001101326653001401337653004001351653001701391653001601408653001401424700001401438700001201452700002001464700001201484700001201496773010801508856008601616852000901702655001201711IND60731386420221118191413.0220606e20210615xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073138642DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbpol.2021.1179232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Sufeng10aHigh-conductivity, stable Ag/cellulose paper prepared via in situ reduction of fractal-structured silver particles  aFlexible electronics products have attracted wide attention because of their excellent flexibility, conductivity and stability.

The experimental results show that when the mass ratio of silver to cellulose was 1.5:1, the sheet resistance of conductive paper is as low as 0.02 Ω·sq⁻¹, and the conductivity reaches 1041.33 S cm⁻¹, which shows excellent conductivity. In order to expand the application of conductive paper in the field of flexible wearable electronic products, the mechanical stability and oxidation resistance of conductive paper were tested.

Environmental impacts in surface waters include algal blooms and disruption to ecological function. Strategies for protection of rivers from eutrophication include improved agricultural land management, conservation farming methods, recycling or retention of drainage and runoff water, and use of buffer strips and riparian vegetation for filtration. Reduction in pesticide use has been achieved by improved application technologies, precision farming, adoption of organic farming, and use of biological control methods. Australian river health audits show widespread deterioration, and protection using the “Polluter Pays Principle” is attractive. However, who should pay for environmental assessment, for adoption of new technologies or change in land use, and how will this be determined? Unfortunately, as demonstrated in two case studies on algal blooms and cotton pesticides, the links between pollutant source and environmental impact remain poorly understood, and the complexity of assessing environmental benefit of agricultural changes makes sheeting home the costs of pollution sources difficult. Alternatives to imposition of penalties include catchment-based targets and guidelines, benchmarking, and adoption of best management practice with an emphasis on incentives and encouragement. Many strategies for risk reduction in agricultural cropping systems are available for inclusion in a “Catchment Care” approach.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural land 3aagrochemicals 3aalgal blooms 3aaudits 3abest management practices 3abiocides 3abiological control 3acase studies 3aconservation buffers 3acotton 3acropping systems 3adrainage 3aecological function 3aecosystems 3aenvironmental assessment 3aenvironmental impact 3aeutrophication 3afertilizers 3afiltration 3afungicides 3aguidelines 3aherbicides 3ainsecticides 3aland use 3anitrogen 3aorganic production 3apesticide use reduction 3aphosphorus 3apollutants 3apolluter pays principle 3apollution 3aprecision agriculture 3arecycling 3ariparian vegetation 3arisk reduction 3arivers 3arunoff 3asurface water 3atechnology 3awatersheds0 tResources.g2013 Sept. 23, v. 2, no. 3 p.439-456dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21558x2079-92767nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/resources20304393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02443naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001600149245010900165300001400274520101300288592002801301650003601329650001301365650002301378650002401401650003101425650002401456650001301480650003501493650002301528650002601551650001001577650001301587653000901600653001101609653002101620700001701641700001601658700001401674700001401688700001301702700001801715700001401733773008701747856008301834990002301917852000901940655001201949IND60697556720221120165015.0200605e201804  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069755672DNAL7 a10.1016/j.virol.2018.02.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Jian10aMetalloprotease ADAM17 regulates porcine epidemic diarrhea virus infection by modifying aminopeptidase N  ap. 24-29.  aPorcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) is a causative agent of porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED). PED, characterized by acute diarrhea, vomiting, dehydration, has caused serious economic losses in pig industry worldwide. Here, we demonstrate that activation of a disintergrin and metalloprotease 17 (ADAM17) induced the decrease of PEDV infection in HEK293 and IPEC-J2 cells and the downregulation of cell surface aminopeptidase N (APN) expression, an important entry factor for PEDV infection. Furthermore, overexpression of ADAM17 suppressed PEDV infection in HEK293 and IPEC-J2 cells, whereas ablation of ADAM17 expression using ADAM17 specific siRNA resulted in a corresponding increase of PEDV infection and an upregulation of cell surface APN expression. Taken together, these data demonstrate that modulation of APN expression by metalloprotease ADAM17 regulates PEDV infection. Hence, the reduction in APN expression represents another component of the anti-PEDV infection response initiated by ADAM17.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPorcine epidemic diarrhea virus 3adiarrhea 3aetiological agents 3afinancial economics 3agene expression regulation 3agene overexpression 3aindustry 3amembrane alanyl aminopeptidase 3ametalloproteinases 3asmall interfering RNA 3aswine 3avomiting 0aPEDV 0aADAM17 0aAminopeptidase N1 aGuo, Longjun1 aYang, Lijun1 aXu, Jiayu1 aZhang, Lu1 aFeng, Li1 aChen, Hongyan1 aWang, Yue0 tVirology.g2018 Apr., v. 517 p.24-29dElsevier Inc.wJournal:2802x0042-68227nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.virol.2018.02.0013Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03187naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245011900170300001600289520171400305592002802019650002102047650001202068650001702080650001602097650001102113650001402124650001302138650001302151650001402164650001502178650001702193650001602210650001602226650001002242650000902252651002802261651001102289653002402300653002102324653001902345653001502364653002402379653001202403700001902415700002002434700002202454773008702476856008502563852000902648655001202657IND60084250320221121105526.0190403e201310  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008425032DNAL7 a10.1016/j.catena.2013.03.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPawlik, Łukasz10aSurface processes and interactions with forest vegetation on a steep mudstone slope, Stołowe Mountains, SW Poland  ap. 203-216.  aIn this study we recognize complex physical biotic–abiotic interactions on a steep forested slope in the moderately elevated mountain terrain of the Sudetes, Central Europe, using geomorphological, pedological, and dendrochronological methods. On the forested hillslopes of Mt Rogowa Kopa the evidence of disturbance in natural systems is widespread. In the geomorphic subsystem its most obvious manifestation is the origin and disappearance of pit-and-mound microtopography resulting from tree uprooting. 82 pit-and-mound associations have been mapped on a test slope, providing quantitative data for calculating sediment flux. The flux is around 2×10−4m3m−1year−1, hence less than suggested in the literature but within the same order of magnitude. Nevertheless, in the long term such a transport rate is comparable with the one typical for creep, while it affects a greater thickness of hillslope regolith. Tree bending and abrupt changes in tree ring width are indicators of disturbed tree growth, causally linked to soil creep of mudstone-derived regolith. Eccentric growth is best recorded in wet years and in younger trees, which have to adapt to the pre-existing pit-and-mound surface topography. We offer a conceptual model that links biotic and abiotic factors and discuss implications of the widespread tree uprooting. We suggest that veneers of angular clasts and occasional larger boulders are not necessarily residuals of washed Pleistocene solifluction mantles but may result from root plate degradation after uprooting. Recent catastrophic wind events may, through tree uprooting, lead to structural changes in cover deposits so that they lose their inherited, periglacial signatures.  aPublisher supplied data 3adendrochronology 3aforests 3agrowth rings 3amicrorelief 3amodels 3amountains 3amudstone 3aregolith 3asediments 3asoil creep 3asolifluction 3atree damage 3atree growth 3atrees 3awind 3aCentral European region 3aPoland 0aHillslope evolution 0aBiogeomorphology 0aTree uprooting 0aSoil creep 0aDendrogeomorphology 0aSudetes1 aMigoń, Piotr,1 aOwczarek, Piotr1 aKacprzak, Andrzej0 tCatena.g2013 Oct., v. 109 p.203-216dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6271x0341-81627nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.catena.2013.03.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02081naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245013100172300001600303520096700319592002801286650002001314650001201334650001101346650001301357650001701370650001301387650002401400653002101424653002601445653001901471653001201490700002401502773010001526856008401626852000901710655001201719IND60123400420221122073830.0150325e20140903xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012340042DNAL7 a10.1080/10871209.2014.9405612doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aForstchen, Ann B.14aThe Essential Role of Human Dimensions and Stakeholder Participation in States’ Fulfillment of Public Trust Responsibilities  ap. 417-426.  aThe Public Trust Doctrine (PTD) vests states with a fiduciary responsibility to manage wildlife for the benefit of current and future generations. States have varied approaches to applying the PTD for wildlife management ranging from a traditional focus on hunters, anglers, and trappers to a progressive approach of broad inclusion of all potential stakeholders in their decision-making processes. We argue that states need to gather and incorporate more and better human dimensions (HD) information to fulfill their PTD responsibilities. We describe some of the barriers to increased use of HD and the changes in agency culture, staffing, data gathering, and decision-making processes necessary to integrate HD effectively and comport with the PTD. We conclude that in addition to increasing fulfillment of PTD responsibilities, increased use of HD information will help maintain agency relevance, increase political support, and secure broader agency funding.  aPublisher supplied data 3adecision making 3afunding 3ahumans 3apolitics 3astakeholders 3awildlife 3awildlife management 0ahuman dimensions 0apublic trust doctrine 0astate agencies 0afunding1 aSmith, Christian A.0 tHuman dimensions of wildlife.g2014 Sept. 3, v. 19, no. 5 p.417-426dRoutledgex1533-158X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10871209.2014.9405613Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02574naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245013100172500001900303520140000322592002801722650001201750650002101762650001101783650002201794653003701816653001601853700002401869700002701893700002001920700001601940700002501956700002201981773011402003856008602117852000902203655001202212IND60717689420221118022929.0210105e202101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071768942DNAL7 a10.1016/j.indcrop.2020.1130802doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPin, Thaynara C.10aInfluence of chain length in protic ionic liquids on physicochemical and structural features of lignins from sugarcane bagasse  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe mechanisms behind lignin dissolution with protic ionic liquids (PILs) and their influence over lignin properties remain not fully explored. In this work, physicochemical and structural features of lignins extracted from sugarcane bagasse after pretreatment with a series of PILs (length of the cation chain combined with different anions) were assessed using analytical techniques. It was found that the lignin extracted with shorter chain length cations PILs showed the highest β-O-4 content. Opposite, the increase of the PILs cation chain length resulted in enhanced depolymerization. All lignins presented high polydispersity (>3.7), while the weight average molecular ranged from 1921 to 13,539 g/mol. The recovered [Eti][Mal] lignin presented the higher β-O-4 content and was possibly the most preserved lignin obtained. Opposite, lignin isolated from [Hex][Ac] and [Hex][For] treatments had less β-O-4 linkages attributed to the depolymerization of lignin via rupture of ether linkages generating intermediates that further repolymerized and/or depolymerized. These results suggest that the ionicity of the PIL is a crucial factor for lignin dissolution. Furthermore, these results illustrate that the proposed pretreatment using different PILs is useful to obtain high-quality lignins with distinct features and opens a new perspective for materials to match various applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3acations 3adepolymerization 3alignin 3asugarcane bagasse 0aPhysicochemical characterization 0aBiorefinery1 aBrenelli, Lívia B.1 aNascimento, Viviane M.1 aCosta, Aline C.1 aPu, Yunqiao1 aRagauskas, Arthur J.1 aRabelo, Sarita C.0 tIndustrial crops and products.g2021 Jan., v. 159 p.113080-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl49222x0926-66907nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.indcrop.2020.1130803Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04791naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006300148245018000211300001800391520281400409592002803223650002003251650001803271650001503289650001303304650001203317650002203329650002803351650001803379650001503397650001703412650000803429650003203437650002503469650003003494650002303524650002603547650001303573650002003586650001903606650003103625653002903656653001703685653001203702653003303714700002803747700003103775700002603806700003703832700003303869700002403902700002603926710003303952773011203985856008304097852000904180655001204189IND60613775220221119154932.0190725e201906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061377522DNAL7 a10.1016/j.clnu.2018.05.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMatia Martin, Pilar1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1424-835210aEffectiveness of an oral diabetes-specific supplement on nutritional status, metabolic control, quality or life, and functional status in elderly patients. A multicentre study  ap. 1253-1261.  aThe purpose of this study was to assess nutritional status, quality of life (QoL) and function in malnourished or at risk for malnutrition community-dwelling (CD) and nursing home-dwelling (NHD) elderly patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM2), receiving treatment with a diabetes-specific oral nutritional supplement (DSONS).A prospective, multicentre, observational study was conducted. A DSONS (high-calorie, high-protein, with slow-digestible carbohydrate and high monounsaturated fatty acid – MUFA-content – Glucerna® 1.5 Cal) had been prescribed the week before inclusion. The following assessments were undertaken at baseline (BL), at week 6 (V1) and at month 3 (FV): body mass index (BMI), glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c), nutritional status (Mini Nutritional Assessment – MNA), QoL (EQ-5D questionnaire), and functional status (Katz Index – KI of Independence in Activities of Daily Living). The data were reported in the overall population (OP) and in the CD and NHD groups.A total of 402 patients aged 80.8 ± 8.5 years were evaluable (44.5% men), including 61.7% CD and 38.3% NHD. BMI (kg/m2) increased in the OP from 22.0 ± 3.5 at BL to 22.5 ± 3.6 at V1 (p < 0.001) and 23.0 ± 3.7 at the FV (p < 0.001). BMI also increased in the CD group (p < 0.001) and in the NHD group (p < 0.001). HbA1c decreased in the OP from 7.3 ± 1.1% at BL to 7.2 ± 1.0% at V1 and 7.0 ± 0.9% at the FV (p < 0.001), in both the CD (p < 0.001) and the NHD groups (p = 0.020). The mean overall MNA score increased in the OP from 13.1 ± 4.8 at BL to 17.0 ± 4.7 at V1 and 18.6 ± 5.1 at the FV (p < 0.001). The mean overall MNA score also increased in the CD (p < 0.001) and the NHD groups (p < 0.001). The mean overall EQ-5D score improved in the OP from 46.0 ± 18.0 at BL to 54.8 ± 17.5 at V1 and 59.7 ± 18.8 at the FV (p < 0.001). The mean overall EQ-5D score also improved in the CD (p < 0.001) and the NHD groups (p < 0.001). Gastrointestinal adverse events were seen in only 2% of patients. Treatment compliance was 94.4%.In this study, conducted in routine, multicentre, clinical settings, the treatment with the high-calorie, high-protein, with slow-digestible carbohydrate, and high MUFA content DSNOS – Glucerna® 1.5 Cal-, was associated with improvements in HbA1c, nutritional status, BMI and QoL following 6 weeks and 3 months of treatment in both institutionalised and non-institutionalised elderly patients with diabetes who were malnourished or at risk for malnutrition. A slight improvement in functional status was also observed at 12 weeks. As this is an observational effectiveness study, a randomized controlled trial would be necessary to establish a causal relationship between the DSNOS and the described events.  aPublisher supplied data 3abody mass index 3acarbohydrates 3acompliance 3adiabetes 3aelderly 3afunctional status 3agastrointestinal system 3aglycosylation 3ahemoglobin 3amalnutrition 3amen 3amonounsaturated fatty acids 3anutrition assessment 3anutrition risk assessment 3anutritional status 3aobservational studies 3apatients 3aquality of life 3aquestionnaires 3arandomized clinical trials 0aType 2 diabetes mellitus 0aMalnutrition 0aElderly 0aOral nutritional supplements1 aRobles Agudo, Francisco1 aLopez Medina, Jose Antonio1 aSanz Paris, Alejandro1 aTarazona Santabalbina, Francisco1 aDomenech Pascual, Juan Ramon1 aLopez Penabad, Luis1 aSanz Barriuso, Rebeca2 aGluceNut Study Groupeauthor0 tClinical nutrition.g2019 June, v. 38, no. 3 p.1253-1261dElsevier LtdwJournal:J000000059x0261-56147nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.clnu.2018.05.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02841naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024005100092040001800143100001600161245011200177300001800289500000900307500001500316520167400331592002802005650002002033650001902053650003402072650001402106650001802120650002202138650001702160650002102177650001102198653001002209700001802219773012302237852000902360856009802369655001202467IND9201348820221119091443.0191122e199111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920134882DNAL7 a10.2135/cropsci1991.0011183X003100060006x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEkiz, Hasan10aNuclear and Cytoplasmic Control of Anther Culture Response in Wheat: II.

Two groups of reciprocal crosses were used; One, between alloplasmic lines of T. aestivum L. cultivars Selkirk, Siete Cerros 66, and Penjamo 62 and other T. aestivum cultivars; and the other, between several alloplasmic lines and their nucleus-donor cultivars. Anther donor plants were grown in a greenhouse. Anthers were placed on liquid potato-4 medium for callus induction, and calli were transferred to agar solidified 190-2 media for plant regeneration. Significant reciprocal differences were observed in both groups for all components of anther culture response. Most differences were for callus induction. Reciprocal differences were considered due to cytoplasmic effects rather than maternal effects based on earlier studies. Reciprocal differences observed for one cross of an alloplasmic line and its nuclear donor source indicated that selection of nuclear genes favoring compatibility with the alien cytoplasm had occurred during the backcross process by which the alloplasmic lines were developed. However, in two combinations, heterosis due to nuclear genetic interactions was observed. The results provide substantial supporting evidence for cytoplasm and cytoplasm ✕ nuclear genetic controls of the response of wheat genotypes to anther culture.

CKD patients display accelerated atherosclerotic process, leading to circulatory complications. However, it is currently not clear how uremic conditions accelerate atherosclerosis. Apoptosis is an important homeostatic regulator of vascular smooth cells under pathological conditions. In the present study, we explored the regulation of apoptosis in cells of the vascular wall in the uremic context. We analysed the expression and regulation of the proteins of the BCL2 family that play an essential role in apoptosis. Our results, obtained in mice and primary human smooth muscle cells exposed to two uremic toxins, point to the existence of an alteration in expression and function of one pro-apoptotic member of this family, the protein BAD. We explore the regulation of BAD by uremic toxins and report the sensitization of vascular smooth muscle cells to apoptosis upon BAD induction.  aPublisher supplied data 3aapoptosis 3aatherosclerosis 3ahumans 3akidney diseases 3amice 3amyocytes 3apatients 3aproteins 3arisk factors 3asmooth muscle 3atoxins1 aGodin, Corinne1 aLouandre, Christophe1 aBenchitrit, Joyce1 aPoirot, Sabrina1 aMazière, Jean-Claude1 aMassy, Ziad A1 aGalmiche, Antoine0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2012 Jan. 6, v. 417, no. 1 p.479-483dElsevier Inc.x0006-291X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2011.11.1443Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02290naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002400146245006200170300002000232520109900252592002801351650001301379650002401392650001201416650001301428650001301441650001401454650001401468650001101482650002301493650001701516650002001533700002601553700001501579700001701594700002601611700002301637773012901660856008201789852000901871655001201880IND60576432020221118052016.0170804e20170629xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057643202DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.7b033232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMuche, Dereck
N. F.10aSize-Induced Structural Disorder Enables Ultrahard Oxides  ap. 13898-13905.  aIt has been empirically observed that decreasing grain size in polycrystalline materials leads to an increase in hardness following a linear dependence with the inverse square root of the size. This so-called Hall–Petch relationship was originally observed in metals and was attributed to the blocking effect of grain boundaries on dislocation motion. However, the Hall–Petch theory is not tenable for explaining similar phenomena in oxide ceramics, where dislocations are virtually immobile at ambient temperature. In this study, multinuclear (²⁷Al, ²⁵ Mg) magnetic resonance spectroscopy is utilized to demonstrate that a reduction in the grain size of MgAl₂O₄ spinel nanoceramics induces structural disorder in the form of cation site inversion in the grain boundary region, which leads to an increase in the average bond density and bond strength. The rapid increase in the volume fraction of such structurally disordered and strong grain boundary regions with decreasing grain size of the nanoceramics is responsible for the corresponding remarkable increase in the hardness.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaluminum 3aambient temperature 3acations 3aceramics 3ahardness 3amagnesium 3amagnetism 3aoxides 3aphysical chemistry 3aspectroscopy 3astable isotopes1 aMarple, Maxwell A.

However, molecular regulation of flowering time variation in roses remains poorly characterized. Here, we report an expansion of the FAR1/FRS-like genes that correlates well with the switch to prostrate-to-erect growth of shoots upon flowering in Rosa wichuraiana ‘Basye's Thornless' (BT). With the availability of the high-quality chromosome-level genome assembly for BT that we developed recently, we identified 91 RwFAR1/FRS-like genes, a significant expansion in contrast to 52 in Rosa chinensis ‘Old Blush’ (OB), a founder genotype in modern rose domestication. Rose FAR1/FRS-like proteins feature distinct variation in protein domain structures. The dispersed expansion of RwFAR1/FRS-like genes occurred specifically in clade I and II and is significantly associated with transposon insertion in BT. Most of the RwFAR1/FRS-like genes showed relatively higher expression level than their corresponding orthologs in OB. FAR1/FRS-like genes regulate light-signaling processes, shade avoidance, and flowering time in Arabidopsis thaliana. Therefore, the expansion and duplication of RwFAR1/FRS-like genes, followed by diversification in gene expression, might offer a novel leverage point for further understanding the molecular regulation of the variation in shoot-growth behavior and flowering time in roses.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aRosa chinensis 3aRosa lucieae 3adomestication 3agene expression 3agenome assembly 3agenotype 3ahorticulture 3aprotein domains 3aspecies diversity 3atemporal variation 3atransposons 0aRose 0aFAR1/FRS-Like genes 0aGene family expansion 0aFlowering time 0aShoot growth behavior1 aJiang, Xiao-Dong1 aCui, Wei-Hua1 aHu, Jin-Yong1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2187-91680 tPlant diversity.g2021 Apr., v. 43, no. 2 p.173-179dElsevier B.V.aKunming Institute of Botany, Chinese Academy of ScienceswJournal:23310x2468-26597nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.pld.2020.11.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03586naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001400152245007900166300001800245520214800263592002802411650001502439650001102454650001902465650001902484650001102503650002902514650002402543650002202567650001802589650001602607650001702623651001002640653001802650653001902668653002902687653002802716653003802744700001802782700001402800700001802814700005502832700002102887773010002908856008703008852000903095655001203104IND60610878920221117224616.0201202e20181015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061087892DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apenergy.2018.07.0292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Jie10aStagnating CO2 emissions with in-depth socioeconomic transition in Beijing  ap. 1714-1725.  aCurbing the growth of global CO₂ emissions and limiting global average temperature rise to well below 2 °C are important targets for the international society after the Paris Climate Change Conference. Given the continuously increasing emission trends in most of the developing world, peaking emissions as soon as possible during the developing and transition process is a key challenge in realizing the target globally. In this study, we established a comprehensive analysis framework for peaking stage analysis, based on three scopes accounting, and estimating the impact of in-depth socioeconomic transitions on peaking stages. We further applied it to Beijing, which reversed its growth trend in CO₂ emissions and acted as a pioneer in fulfilling the peaking target of emissions during in-depth socioeconomic transition period, in recent years. We found that the turning point for production-based CO₂ emissions in Beijing appeared around 2007, which stopped growing and has since been fluctuating around 100 Mt. During the in-depth industrialization process, accelerating the elimination of energy and carbon intensive industries, such as resource-related heavy manufacturing, promoting the transition from industries to services, and upgrading the internal structure of industries, were key factors determining the CO₂ emissions peak in Beijing. Meanwhile, the optimization of the internal production structure of consumer and producer services also led to a declining trend of services with the in-depth industrial transition. During the in-depth urbanization process, the reduced CO₂ intensity and optimized production structure of shelter and household equipment, and upgraded services dominated consumption structure were the main reasons for urban household CO₂ mitigation. Clarifying the mechanism of the CO₂ emissions peak during the in-depth socioeconomic transition period in Beijing will help us understand the challenges of peak better and provide valuable references for other countries and regions in the developing world that are facing peaking emissions challenges in the processes of their development.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaccounting 3acarbon 3acarbon dioxide 3aclimate change 3aenergy 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3ahousehold equipment 3aindustrialization 3amanufacturing 3atemperature 3aurbanization 3aChina 0aCO2 emissions 0aPeaking target 0aSocioeconomic transition 0aInput–output analysis 0aStructural decomposition analysis1 aXiong, Yiling1 aTian, Xin1 aLiu, Shangwei1 aLi, Jiashuo1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9619-52571 aTanikawa, Hiroki0 tApplied energy.g2018 Oct. 15, v. 228 p.1714-1725dElsevier LtdwJournal:11876x0306-26197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2018.07.0293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02446naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245013200167300002000299500001900319520128800338592002801626650001501654650001901669650001601688650001401704650001701718650001901735650001701754650001401771650001301785650001101798700001501809773016901824856008201993852000902075655001202084IND60710538220221120135308.0200911e202010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071053822DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-019-07168-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShen, Feixiang10aEffects of fuel types and fuel sulfur content on the characteristics of particulate emissions in marine low-speed diesel engine  ap. 37229-37236.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe emission of particulate matter from ships does great harm to human health and atmospheric environment. Sulfur emission regulations also affect particulate matter emissions due to fuel change. Particulate matter (PM) emitted from low-speed, two-stroke, large-power diesel engine were studied in test-bed experiments. Experiments were conducted at 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100% load with heavy fuel oil (HFO, 3.36%m/m S) and a lighter marine diesel oil (MDO, 0.1%m/m S). The experiments revealed that using MDO could decrease the mass emission factors (EFs) of PM compared to HFO due to the fuel quality and content; however, there was no obvious difference for the number EFs of PM. The main particle when using HFO consists sulfates and bound water, and the hydrate sulfur increased with the increased engine loads. Then, another 21% is organic carbon (OC). Emission factors for inorganic elements were also studied in particles from combustion of HFO and MDO. The EFs of OC and elemental carbon (EC) were affected by engine loads, fuel type, fuel sulfur content (FSC), and combustion conditions. The size distribution of OC was similar to EC, and there were two clearly peaks for every particulate matter sample. The key effect factor for EFs of PM with marine fossil fuels was FSC.  aPublisher supplied data 3acombustion 3adiesel engines 3adiesel fuel 3afuel oils 3ahuman health 3aorganic carbon 3aparticulates 3apollution 3aresearch 3asulfur1 aLi, Xiaobo0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research international.g2020 Oct., v. 27, no. 30 p.37229-37236dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-019-07168-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03027naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003700092040001800129100002000147245013000167300001600297500000900313520161300322592002801935650001301963650002701976650002902003650000902032650002102041650000902062650001702071650002202088650002802110650002402138650001902162650002002181700002402201700002402225700002302249700002402272700002102296700001902317700001902336773012102355852000902476856008402485655001202569IND4433764520221120051627.0191228e201003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443376452DNAL7 a10.2135/cropsci2009.03.01212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKahler, Alex L.10aNorth American Study on Essential Derivation in Maize: II.

It is widely accepted that molecular markers can provide data to help determine EDV status. We screened publicly available simple sequence repeat (SSR) loci using a set of inbred lines, including those that have been widely used or are of historic importance to maize (Zea mays L.) breeding in the United States. As a result of that screening process we hereby publish a set of 285 SSRs that have been validated by the American Seed Trade Association (ASTA) for use in variety identification and for assistance in determining EDV status in U.S. maize. One hundred and fifty SSRs constitute the ASTA Core Set 1; additional data, if required, can be obtained by using the additional 135 SSRs. We also report on comparisons of abilities of the ASTA-designated SSRs to discriminate among and show associations among inbred lines compared with results obtained from another (partially overlapping) set of SSRs selected by the French Association of Maize Breeders (SEPROMA). There was a high correlation (R ² = 0.79) for pairwise distances among a subset of 30 U.S. inbreds for SSR data obtained using the ASTA protocols compared with those obtained using the SEPROMA protocols. Consequently, there are now two published sets of protocols and procedures that can be used to assist in variety identification and in the determination of essential derivation in maize depending on circumstances and available resources.  aPublisher supplied data 3aZea mays 3amicrosatellite repeats 3aplant variety protection 3aloci 3agenetic distance 3acorn 3ainbred lines 3agenetic variation 3acultivar identification 3agermplasm screening 3abreeding lines 3agenetic markers1 aKahler, Jonathan L.1 aThompson, Steven A.1 aFerriss, Ronald S.1 aJones, Elizabeth S.1 aNelson, Barry K.1 aMikel, Mark A.1 aSmith, Stephen0 tCrop science.g2010 Mar., v. 50, no. 2 p.486-503dCrop Science Society of AmericawJournal:jnl44570x0011-183X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2135/cropsci2009.03.01213Available from publisher's site 7aarticle03813naa a2200649 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002400164245010400188300001600292500001500308520182900323592002802152650002802180650001602208650001202224650001102236650001002247650001902257650001902276650001302295650001102308650001602319650002302335650000902358650001602367650001502383650001902398650003802417650001302455650001302468650001202481650002402493650001702517650002002534650002902554650006302583650004802646650002902694650001602723650003802739650005702777650002102834650006402855650001602919650004002935653001502975653001702990773008703007856004803094852000903142655001203151IND4487504020221122024123.0120625e201207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448750402DNAL7 a218053842pmid7 a10.1007/s00709-011-0308-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKhanna-Chopra, Renu10aLeaf senescence and abiotic stresses share reactive oxygen species-mediated chloroplast degradation  ap. 469-481.  a2019-12-04  aLeaf senescence is a genetically programmed decline in various cellular processes including photosynthesis and involves the hydrolysis of macromolecules such as proteins, lipids, etc. It is governed by the developmental age and is induced or enhanced by environmental stresses such as drought, heat, salinity and others. Internal factors such as reproductive structures also influence the rate of leaf senescence. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation is one of the earliest responses of plant cells under abiotic stresses and senescence. Chloroplasts are the main targets of ROS-linked damage during various environmental stresses and natural senescence as ROS detoxification systems decline with age. Plants adapt to environmental stresses through the process of acclimation, which involves less ROS production coupled with an efficient antioxidant defence. Chloroplasts are a major site of protein degradation, and ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco) is rapidly and selectively degraded during senescence and stress. The process of protein degradation is initiated by ROS and involves the action of proteolytic enzymes such as cysteine and serine proteases. The mechanism of Rubisco degradation still remains to be elucidated. The molecular understanding of leaf senescence was achieved through the characterization of senescence-associated genes and various senescence mutants of Arabidopsis, which is a suitable model plant showing monocarpic senescence. The regulation of senescence involves many regulatory elements composed of positive and negative elements to fine-tune the initiation and progression of senescence. This review gives an overview on chloroplast protein degradation during leaf senescence and abiotic stresses and also highlights the role of ROS management in both processes.  aPublisher supplied data 3areactive oxygen species 3aacclimation 3adrought 3alipids 3agenes 3aplant response 3aphotosynthesis 3acysteine 3aleaves 3aArabidopsis 3aserine proteinases 3aheat 3aproteolysis 3ahydrolysis 3aabiotic stress 3aribulose-bisphosphate carboxylase 3aproteins 3asalinity 3amutants 3aprotein degradation 3achloroplasts 2aAcclimatization 2aAntioxidantsxmetabolism 2aArabidopsisxgrowth & developmentxmetabolismxphysiology. 2aArabidopsis Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aChloroplastsxmetabolism 2aEnvironment 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plant 2aOryzaxgrowth & developmentxmetabolismxphysiology. 2aOxidative Stress 2aPlant Leavesxgrowth & developmentxmetabolismxphysiology. 2aProteolysis 2aReactive Oxygen Speciesxmetabolism 0asenescence 0aantioxidants0 tProtoplasma.g2012 July, v. 249, no. 3 p.469-481dSpringer-Verlagx0033-183X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00709-011-0308-z  aDNAL 7aarticle01202naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094024002200121024001900143040001800162100002000180245004800200300001800248506007600266520019800342592002800540506003700568650001300605650002300618650002300641650002200664773011800686856007500804852000900879655001200888IND60550331220221207124319.0160910e20140321xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055033122DNAL7 a10.1021/jo500044d2doi7 aPMC39856842pmcid7 a245714342pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPlatz, Matthew,12aA Perspective on Physical Organic Chemistry  ap. 2341-2353.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aA perspective on the development of mechanistic carbene chemistry is presented.

However, the low conversion efficiency of fuel is the key challenge for the in situ gasification CLC with natural iron ore as an oxygen carrier. The reactivity of the selected 6% K₂CO₃-modified iron ore (6KMIO) was first determined by H₂ and CO in TGA, and an enhanced reduction reactivity of 6KMIO was confirmed. Afterward, the feasibility of 6MKIO for coal CLC was tested in a 1 kW continuous reactor. The continuous reactor could be stably operated without any tendency of agglomeration or sintering among 6KMIO particles. Compared with use of the raw iron ore, the use of 6KMIO enhanced the coal conversion and the gasification-products conversion, promoting the CO₂ capture efficiency. Furthermore, the mechanism of the catalyzed coal CLC process and the release of sulfur was explored.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbon monoxide 3acatalytic activity 3acoal 3acombustion 3aengineering 3agasification 3ahydrogen 3airon 3aoxygen 3asulfur1 aShen, Laihong1 aZhong, Zhaoping1 aNiu, Xin1 aGe, Huijun1 aZhou, Yufei1 aXiao, Shen0 tIndustrial & Engineering Chemistry Research.g2014 Aug. 20, v. 53, no. 33 p.13006-13015dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-50457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fie501328h3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03196naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002200094024001900116024003900135040001800174100001800192245014200210500001900352506007600371520183700447592002802284506003702312650002702349650001602376650001202392650002002404650001002424650001302434650003702447650001702484650001402501651001202515653001702527653002302544700001902567773009302586856008602679852000902765655001202774IND60690757620221207051901.0201206e201803  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069075762DNAL7 aPMC58578112pmcid7 a295604722pmid7 a10.1016/j.heliyon.2018.e005622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKapoor, Priya10aCombination antibiotics against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, representing common and rare cystic fibrosis strains from different Irish clinics  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aTo evaluate the effect of antibiotic combination therapy versus single therapy against cystic fibrosis strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa identified as common and rare among patient groups in different Irish hospitals.This study compares the susceptibility profiles of P. aeruginosa isolates from different cystic fibrosis (CF) clinics in Ireland, collected from 2004–2005. Strains were recovered in small numbers and typed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. Five common clonal variants were identified in five different hospitals, described as ‘common strains’. A number of ‘rare strains’ associated with any single patient were also included in the study. Certain virulence factors were determined and in vitro assays such as minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) and biofilm inhibitory concentrations (BIC) were employed to assess potential synergistic effects of antipseudomonal antibiotic combination therapy.There was no distinct virulence factors associated with clinical strains that were common in comparison to those that were rare. Antibiotic combination testing revealed the majority of combinations were similar to the activity of either antibiotic used as single agents. Tobramycin-ceftazidime was the most effective combination exhibiting synergistic interactions (FIC ≤ 0.5) against certain clinical isolates of P. aeruginosa.The efficacy of single antibiotics and synergistic interactions of antibiotic combinations were strain specific, irrespective of virulence characteristics of P. aeruginosa. Common clonal P. aeruginosa strains do not have distinct characteristics that possibly influence persistence in the chronic CF lung. Tobramycin-ceftazidime may be successful for controlling specific P. aeruginosa strains. Further studies on representative isolates are needed to support these results.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aPseudomonas aeruginosa 3aantibiotics 3abiofilm 3acystic fibrosis 3alungs 3apatients 3apulsed-field gel electrophoresis 3atherapeutics 3avirulence 3aIreland 0aMicrobiology 0aInfectious disease1 aMurphy, Philip0 tHeliyon.g2018 Mar., v. 4, no. 3 p.e00562-dElsevier LtdwJournal:23264x2405-84407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2018.e005623Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03973naa a2200649 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003900135040001800174100002000192245012400212300001600336506007600352520174400428536020802172592002802380596010602408506003702514650001602551650002102567650001502588650003102603650002702634650001602661650001002677650001802687650001402705650002302719650001002742650001302752650000902765650001102774650001602785650002402801650002202825650000902847650001402856653001302870653001602883653001502899653001402914653001802928653001802946700002102964700002202985700003003007700001903037700002503056700002103081773011403102856008603216852000903302655001203311IND60689944820221207141910.0211113e20190101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068994482DNAL7 a312427942pmid7 aPMC65985002pmcid7 a10.1080/13880209.2019.16280742doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCruz, Lorena A.10aAssessment of the antinociceptive and anti-inflammatory activities of the stem methanol extract of Diplotropis purpurea  ap. 432-436.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aContext: Since there is still a great need to search for plant species with antinociceptive and anti-inflammatory activities, Diploptropis purpurea (Rich.) Amshoff (Fabaceae) is studied for the first time. Objective: This evaluates the analgesic and anti-inflammatory activities of the stem methanol extract of Diplotropis purpurea (MEDP). Material and methods: The anti-inflammatory and analgesic effects of MEDP of D. purpurea were evaluated in vivo. The antinociceptive activity was assessed in CD1 male mice were treated by oral gavage with 500 mg/kg of MEDP 30 min before submitting to acetic acid-induced abdominal writhing, hot-plate, and formalin tests. Paws oedema induced by carrageenan, histamine or serotonin were performed in male Sprague–Dawley rats to determinate the anti-inflammatory activity. Results: Oral administration of MEDP produced significant antinociceptive effects on the inflammatory phase in the formalin test [12.0 s versus 72.5 s in carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) control group]. MEDP produced an analgesic effect in the hot-plate model, although the effect was modest compared to tramadol (40 and 60%, respectively). The oral administration of MEDP in a dose of 500 mg/kg showed maximum inhibition (75.1%) after 0.5 h in carrageenan-induced oedema, but it did not modify histamine or serotonin-induced oedemas. Discussion and conclusion: In the peripheral nociception model, acetic acid-induced abdominal writhing, the MEDP did not show a protective effect, but its analgesic effects were evident in the inflammatory phase of the formalin test and in the hot-plate model. These results show that the anti-inflammatory effect was accompanied by a reduction in the perception of painful stimuli.  aThis work was supported by SENACYT (National Secretariat for Science, Technology and Innovation of Panama) through projects FID11-090 and INF11-054, and MPG thanks the SNI program of research incentives.  aPublisher supplied data  aFID11-090aINF11-054cSENACYT (National Secretariat for Science, Technology and Innovation of Panama)0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDiplotropis 3aanalgesic effect 3aanalgesics 3aanti-inflammatory activity 3acarboxymethylcellulose 3acarrageenan 3aedema 3aformalin test 3ahistamine 3alaboratory animals 3amales 3amethanol 3amice 3amodels 3anociception 3aoral administration 3aprotective effect 3arats 3aserotonin 0aFabaceae 0acarrageenan 0apaw oedema 0ahot plate 0aformalin test 0awrithing test1 aDíaz, Miguel A.1 aGupta, Mahabir P.1 aLópez-Pérez, José Luis1 aMondolis, Eily1 aMorán-Pinzón, Juan1 aGuerrero, Estela0 tPharmaceutical biology.g2019 Jan. 1, v. 57, no. 1 p.432-436dTaylor & FranciswJournal:2153x1744-51167nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13880209.2019.16280743Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02285naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002300148245010400171500001400275520092000289592002801209650001601237650000801253650001101261650001101272650001701283650002901300650001701329650000901346650001101355650000701366650001301373650001101386650001401397650001201411650001001423653001101433653002201444653001301466653001001479653001201489700002001501700002701521700002201548700002101570773009601591856008301687852000901770655001201779IND60717455820221122202110.0201223e20201201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071745582DNAL7 a10.1016/j.wroa.2020.1000772doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSoliman, Mona Y.M.10aInactivation of RNA and DNA viruses in water by copper and silver ions and their synergistic effect  aNAL-light  aCu and Ag have been used as bactericidal agents since ancient times, yet their antiviral capacity in water remains poorly understood. This study tested the effect of copper (Cu) and silver (Ag) on model RNA and DNA viruses MS2 and PhiX 174 in solution at pH 6–8. Cu caused MS2 inactivation with similar rates at pH 6 and 7 but was inert towards PhiX 174 regardless of pH. Ag inactivated both viruses, causing denaturation of MS2 and loss of capsid spikes in PhiX 174. Ag inactivation rates were pH dependent and increased with increasing pH. At pH 8, 6.5 logs of PhiX were inactivated after 3 h and 3 logs of MS2 after only 10 min. The combined use of Cu and Ag revealed synergy in disinfecting MS2 at pH ≥ 7. Although metal concentrations used were higher than the desired values for drinking water treatment, the results prove a promising potential of Cu and Ag combinations as efficient viricidal agents.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA viruses 3aRNA 3acapsid 3acopper 3adenaturation 3adrinking water treatment 3ainactivation 3aions 3amodels 3apH 3aresearch 3asilver 3asynergism 3aviruses 3awater 0aMetals 0aMS2 bacteriophage 0aPhiX 174 0aVirus 0aSynergy1 aMedema, Gertjan1 aBonilla, Boris Estrada1 aBrouns, Stan J.J.1 avan Halem, Doris0 tWater research.g2020 Dec. 01, v. 9 p.100077-dElsevier LtdwJournal:27256x2589-91477nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wroa.2020.1000773Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02378naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001400150245017500164300001600339520103500355592002801390650002501418650001001443650002701453650002301480650001101503650001701514650002501531651001001556653001001566653001001576653003601586653001801622653001701640700001601657700001301673700002101686700001801707700001901725773010701744856008401851852000901935655001201944IND60606880120221119001438.0180730e201601  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060688012DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envpol.2015.10.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSun, Qian10aSeasonal and spatial variations of PPCP occurrence, removal and mass loading in three wastewater treatment plants located in different urbanization areas in Xiamen, China  ap. 371-381.  aThe occurrence and fate of 48 pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) in three wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) located in different urbanization areas in Xiamen, China was investigated over one year. Results showed that PPCPs were widely detected, but the major PPCPs in the influent, effluent, and sludge were different. Spatial and seasonal variations of PPCP levels in the influent and sludge were observed. The removal efficiencies for most PPCPs were similar among the three WWTPs, although they employed different biological treatment processes. Furthermore, the mass loadings per inhabitant of most pharmaceuticals had a positive correlation with the urbanization levels, indicating that most pharmaceutical usage was higher in the urban core compared to the suburban zones. The total mass loadings of all the 48 PPCPs in the effluent and waste sludge showed close proportions, which suggested the importance of proper waste sludge disposal to prevent a large quantity of PPCPs from entering the environment.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiological treatment 3adrugs 3apersonal care products 3aseasonal variation 3asludge 3aurbanization 3awastewater treatment 3aChina 0aPPCPs 0aWWTPs 0aSeasonal and spatial variations 0aMass loadings 0aUrbanization1 aLi, Mingyue1 aMa, Cong1 aChen, Xiangqiang1 aXie, Xiaoqing1 aYu, Chang-Ping0 tEnvironmental pollution.g2016 Jan., v. 208 p.371-381dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl41014x0269-74917nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2015.10.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02703naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002000140245008400160520161400244592002801858650001301886650000901899650001001908650001101918650001401929650001501943650001201958651001101970700002101981700002102002700002002023700002302043700002502066700002602091773012802117856007502245852000902320655001202329IND60766961120221117201019.0220211e20220119xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076696112DNAL7 a10.3390/rs140304692doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNieto, Luciana 10aImpact of High-Cadence Earth Observation in Maize Crop Phenology Classification  aFor farmers, policymakers, and government agencies, it is critical to accurately define agricultural crop phenology and its spatial-temporal variability. At the moment, two approaches are utilized to report crop phenology. On one hand, land surface phenology provides information about the overall trend, whereas weekly reports from USDA-NASS provide information about the development of particular crops at the regional level. High-cadence earth observations might help to improve the accuracy of these estimations and bring more precise crop phenology classifications closer to what farmers demand. The second component of the proposed solution requires the use of robust classifiers (e.g., random forest, RF) capable of successfully managing large data sets. To evaluate this solution, this study compared the output of a RF classifier model using weather, two different satellite sources (Planet Fusion; PF and Sentinel-2; S-2), and ground truth data to improve maize (Zea mays L.) crop phenology classification using two regions of Kansas (Southwest and Central) as a testbed during the 2017 growing season. Our findings suggests that high temporal resolution (PF) data can significantly improve crop classification metrics (f1-score = 0.94) relative to S-2 (f1-score = 0.86). Additionally, a decline in the f1-score between 0.74 and 0.60 was obtained when we assessed the ability of S-2 to extend the temporal forecast for crop phenology. This research highlights the critical nature of very high temporal resolution (daily) earth observation data for crop monitoring and decision making in agriculture.  aPublisher supplied data 3aZea mays 3acorn 3acrops 3amodels 3aphenology 3asatellites 3aweather 3aKansas1 aHouborg, Rasmus 1 aZajdband, Ariel 1 aJumpasut, Arin 1 aPrasad, P.

While humic substances in the compost have been believed to be carriers for supplying iron to such coastal land, they become coagulated and/or flocculated in seawater. Thus, the focus of the study was on seawater extractable organic matter (SWEOM) from the compost that could function as a chelator of iron. Structural features of a novel organic fraction from the compost, SWEOM, were characterized by TMAH-py-GC/MS and the result were compared with those for humic (HA) and fulvic (FA) acids from the same origin. The TMAH-py-GC/MS analyses provided information on the structural characteristics for HA, FA and SWEOM. FA contained high amount of nitrogen-containing pyrolysate compounds, which were likely derived from saccharides and RNA. The large amounts of methoxybenzenes and hydroxybenzenes, which were originated from lignin, were also identified in the HA. For SWEOM, the percentages of fatty acid pyrolysate compounds were significantly larger than the corresponding values for HA and FA. An acidic functional group analysis indicated that the levels of carboxylic groups in SWEOM were lower than those in HA and FA, suggesting that the fatty acid pyrolysate compounds were produced as the result of the cleavage of ester-linkages.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRNA 3abark 3acarbohydrates 3achelating agents 3acomposts 3afatty acids 3ahumic substances 3airon 3alignin 3apyrolysis 3aseawater 3aslags 3asteel1 aFukushima, Masami1 aYamamoto, Mitsuo1 aKomai, Takeshi1 aKawabe, Yoshishige0 tJournal of analytical and applied pyrolysis.g2013 Jan., v. 99 p.9-15dElsevier B.V.x0165-23707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jaap.2012.11.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03387naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002100140245012400161300001800285500002000303520179900323592002802122650001902150650001502169650001702184650001302201650002502214650001002239650001502249650001902264650001402283650001502297650001402312650005002326650004002376700002102416700002702437700002202464700001802486700002302504700002402527700002402551700002202575700002002597700002602617700002502643773011802668856007402786852000902860655001202869IND60595591220221118120628.0180605e201806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059559122DNAL7 a10.1111/febs.144712doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBiondani, Giulia10aExtracellular matrix composition modulates PDAC parenchymal and stem cell plasticity and behavior through the secretome  ap. 2104-2124.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aPancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is one of the most lethal cancers. Its aggressiveness is driven by an intense fibrotic desmoplastic reaction in which the increasingly collagen I‐rich extracellular matrix (ECM) and several cell types, including cancer stem cells (CSCs), create a tumor‐supportive environment. However, how ECM composition regulates CSC dynamics and their relationship with the principle parenchymal tumor population to promote early invasive growth is not yet characterized. For this, we utilized a platform of 3D organotypic cultures composed of laminin‐rich Matrigel, representative of an early tumor, plus increasing concentrations of collagen I to simulate malignant stroma progression. As ECM collagen I increases, CSCs progress from a rapidly growing, vascular phenotype to a slower growing, avascular phase, while maintaining their endothelial‐like gene signatures. This transition is supported autocrinically by the CSCs and paracrinically by the parenchymal cells via their ECM‐dependent secretomes. Indeed, when growing on an early tumor ECM, the CSCs are dedicated toward the preparation of a vascular niche by (a) activating their growth program, (b) secreting high levels of proangiogenic factors which stimulate both angiogenesis and vasculogenic mimicry, and (c) overexpressing VEGFR‐2, which is activated by VEGF secreted by both the CSC and parenchymal cells. On Matrigel, the more differentiated parenchymal tumor cell population had reduced growth but a high invasive capacity. This concerted high local invasion of parenchymal cells into the CSC‐derived vascular network suggests that a symbiotic relationship between the parenchymal cells and the CSCs underlies the initiation and maintenance of early PDAC infiltration and metastasis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadenocarcinoma 3aaggression 3aangiogenesis 3acollagen 3aextracellular matrix 3agenes 3ametastasis 3aneoplasm cells 3aphenotype 3astem cells 3asymbiosis 3avascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 3avascular endothelial growth factors1 aZeeberg, Katrine1 aGreco, Maria Raffaella1 aCannone, Stefania1 aDando, Ilaria1 aDalla Pozza, Elisa1 aMastrodonato, Maria1 aForciniti, Stefania1 aCasavola, Valeria1 aPalmieri, Marta1 aReshkin, Stephan Joel1 aCardone, Rosa Angela0 tFEBS journal.g2018 June, v. 285, no. 11 p.2104-2124dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3943524x1742-464X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/febs.144713Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02104naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100002500141245005800166520117900224592002801403650002201431650001701453650001401470650001201484650001401496650002001510651002101530700001801551700001801569773011901587856007501706852000901781655001201790IND60715294020221118010023.0201026e20200924xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071529402DNAL7 a10.3390/land91003502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCoruhlu, Yakup  Emre10aConflict over the Use of Hagia Sophia: The Legal Case  aThe historical progress of Hagia Sophia encompasses four different periods. Dating back to 360 AD, this unique structure was the largest church built in Istanbul during the Roman Period. In the second period, Fatih Sultan Mehmet conquered Istanbul in 1453 and personally dedicated Hagia Sophia to his foundation as a mosque. In the third period, upon the founding of the modern Republic of Turkey, Hagia Sophia was transformed into the Museum in 1934. Finally, in 2020, the structure was converted once again to a mosque by a court decision. Ongoing discussions today have suggested that the structure be used as a mosque, a church, or a museum. In this study, the ownership rights of the monument and its cultural heritage status have been examined within the framework of rulings of the European Court of Human Rights. The study evaluates the 1934 decree preventing the owner of the property rights from being given authorization over the monument. The results indicate that there was a legal obligation to grant the use of Hagia Sophia/Ayasofya as a mosque in accordance with the property rights of Fatih Sultan Mehmet, who proclaimed the establishment of its foundation.  aPublisher supplied data 3acultural heritage 3ahuman rights 3amonuments 3amuseums 3aownership 3aproperty rights 3aTurkey (country)1 aUzun, Bayram 1 aYildiz, Okan 0 tLand.g2020 Sept. 24, v. 9, no. 10dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21555x2073-445X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/land91003503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle05170naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001800149245009300167300001200260500001500272520352200287592002803809650002503837650001403862650001003876650002403886650002303910650001103933650001403944650001703958650000803975650002403983650002104007650001404028650001404042650001104056650002204067650001404089650003004103650002004133650002704153650001304180650001504193650002304208650001504231650000904246650001304255651001304268653001804281700001204299700002004311700001604331700001804347773011104365856008304476852000904559655001204568IND60549057920221119205031.0160906e201204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054905792DNAL7 a10.1094/PDIS-01-12-0001-PDN2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOliver, C. L.10aFirst Report of Bacterial Spot of Peony Caused by a Xanthomonas sp. in the United States  ap. 581.  a2019-12-06  aIn early May 2008 and 2009, peony samples (Paeonia spp.) with symptoms of leaf spot and blight were submitted to the Virginia Tech Plant Disease Clinic. The 2008 peony was an unknown cultivar from a northern Virginia landscape. The three cultivars (Dr. Alexander Fleming, Felix Crousse, and Karl Rosenfield) submitted in 2009 were from a commercial nursery in southwestern Virginia that was reporting leaf spot progressing to severe blight, which rendered plants unsalable, on 75% of a 1,219 m² block during a 10-day period of heavy rainfall. Bacterial streaming from spots was observed. On the basis of phenotypic and biochemical tests, the isolates were determined to be xanthomonads. Two isolates (one recovered from the 2008 sample and one from the 2009 sample) were used in the following work. Isolates were characterized by multilocus sequencing (MLST) (4). PCR reactions were prepared and cycled using 2X ImmoMix (Bioline, Tauton, MA) according to manufacturer's recommendations with an annealing temperature of 58°C. Template DNA was added by touching a single colony with a 20-μl pipette tip and placing the tip into the reaction mix for 1 min. Four bands of the expected size were visualized on an electrophoresis gel and cleaned products were sequenced in forward and reverse directions at the University of Chicago, Cancer Research Center DNA Sequencing Facility. Corresponding gene fragments of each isolate were identical. A consensus sequence (PAMDB Isolate ID No. 936) for each of the four gene fragments was constructed and compared with sequences in NCBI (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/) and PAMDB (http://genome.ppws.vt.edu/cgi-bin/MLST/home.pl) (1) databases using Blastn (2). No perfect match was found. Genetic distances between the peony isolates and all strains in PAMDB were determined by MegAlign (Lasergene; DNAStar, Madison, WI). The Xanthomonas strain most similar to the isolates recovered from the peony samples was Xanthomonas hortorum pv. hederae ICMP 1661 with a genetic distance of 0.023; this strongly suggests that the peony isolates belong to X. hortorum. For Koch's postulates, six surface-disinfested young leaflets from Paeonia lactiflora ‘Karl Rosenfield’ were inoculated by forcefully spraying a phosphate-buffered saline suspension of each bacterial isolate (~4.3 × 10⁹ CFU/ml) into the underside of the leaf until leaf tissue appeared water soaked. Controls were inoculated similarly with phosphate-buffered saline solution. Moist chambers with inoculated leaves were incubated at ambient temperature under two 48W fluorescent grow lights with 12 h of light and dark. Circular spots were observed on leaves inoculated with the 2009 and 2008 isolates in 18 and 20 days, respectively. No symptoms were observed on controls. Bacterial streaming from leaf spots was observed by phase-contrast microscopy; bacteria were isolated and confirmed to be identical to the original isolates by the methods described above. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a Xanthomonas sp. causing leaf spot and blight on peony. Although bacterial blight of peony has been attributed to a xanthomonad in recent years, the pathogen had not been further characterized (3).References: (1) N. F. Almeida et al.

TiO2 nanoparticles were prepared by sol–gel method using titanium tetraisopropoxide. The size of TiO2 nanoparticles was characterized using transmission electron microscope (TEM). The application of nano TiO2 onto cellulosic fabrics (cotton 100%) was achieved in presence of polycarboxylic acid [1,2,3,4-butane tetracarboxylic acid (BTCA)] with sodium hypophosphite (SHP) as catalyst and chitosan phosphate through conventional pad-dry-cure method. The effect of the finishing on the physical properties, flammability and antibacterial properties of cross-linked fabrics are investigated. Thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) was employed to investigate the thermal decomposition behaviour of the treated samples. Limited oxygen indexes (LOI) of the treated cotton fabrics were investigated. The treated cotton fabric also reveals excellent antibacterial properties.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantibacterial properties 3acatalysts 3achitosan 3acotton 3acotton fabric 3acrosslinking 3aflame retardants 3aflammability 3ananoparticles 3aoxygen 3aphosphates 3asol-gel processing 3athermal degradation 3athermogravimetry 3atitanium 3atitanium dioxide 3atransmission electron microscopes 3atransmission electron microscopy 0aChitosan phosphate 0aCotton finishing 0aFlame retardant 0aAntibacterial 0aTiO2 nanoparticles1 aElShemy, M.1 aAbou-Okeil, A.0 tCarbohydrate polymers.g2015 Mar. 15, v. 118 p.83-90dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl47819x0144-86177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbpol.2014.11.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03635naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094024002200125024001900147040001800166100003100184245013000215506007600345520162100421592002802042506003702070650003402107650002202141650002502163650002402188650002302212650001402235650001602249650002402265650001502289650002302304650001802327650001602345650001102361650003102372650000902403650001802412650001102430650001202441650001402453650002702467650001702494650001702511650000902528650001502537650001702552700002902569700002902598700003102627700003502658700003402693700003402727700003102761773011902792856007702911852000902988655001202997IND60660535020221207070611.0190823e20190730xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066053502DNAL7 a10.3390/plants80802542doi7 aPMC67240792pmcid7 a313660052pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGarcía-López, Josué  I.10aFoliar Application of Zinc Oxide Nanoparticles and Zinc Sulfate Boosts the Content of Bioactive Compounds in Habanero Peppers  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe physiological responses of habanero pepper plants (Capsicum chinense Jacq.) to foliar applications of zinc sulphate and zinc nano-fertilizer were evaluated in greenhouse trials. The effect of the supplement on fruit quality of habanero pepper was particularly observed. Habanero pepper plants were grown to maturity, and during the main stages of phenological development, they were treated with foliar applications of Zn at concentrations of 1000 and 2000 mg L&minus;1 in the form of zinc sulfate (ZnSO<inf>4</inf>) and zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnO NPs). Additional Zn was not supplied to the control treatment plants. ZnO NPs at a concentration of 1000 mg L&minus;1 positively affected plant height, stem diameter, and chlorophyll content, and increased fruit yield and biomass accumulation compared to control and ZnSO<inf>4</inf> treatments. ZnO NPs at 2000 mg L&minus;1 negatively affected plant growth but significantly increased fruit quality, capsaicin content by 19.3%, dihydrocapsaicin by 10.9%, and Scoville Heat Units by 16.4%. In addition, at 2000 ZnO NPs mg L&minus;1 also increased content of total phenols and total flavonoids (soluble + bound) in fruits (14.50% and 26.9%, respectively), which resulted in higher antioxidant capacity in ABTS (2,2&prime;azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid)), DPPH (2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl), and FRAP (ferric reducing antioxidant power) (15.4%, 31.8%, and 20.5%, respectively). These results indicate that application of ZnO NPs could be employed in habanero pepper production to improve yield, quality, and nutraceutical properties of fruits.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3a2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl 3aCapsicum chinense 3aantioxidant activity 3abioactive compounds 3abiomass production 3acapsaicin 3achlorophyll 3adietary supplements 3aflavonoids 3afoliar application 3afruit quality 3afruit yield 3afruits 3agreenhouse experimentation 3aheat 3ananoparticles 3apepper 3apeppers 3aphenology 3aphysiological response 3aplant growth 3aplant height 3azinc 3azinc oxide 3azinc sulfate1 aNiño-Medina, Guillermo 1 aOlivares-Sáenz, Emilio 1 aLira-Saldivar, Ricardo  H.1 aBarriga-Castro, Enrique  Díaz1 aVázquez-Alvarado, Rigoberto 1 aRodríguez-Salinas, Pablo  A.1 aZavala-García, Francisco 0 tPlants.g2019 July 30, v. 8, no. 8dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21620x2223-77477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/plants80802543Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02247naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001800139245011900157300001800276520120500294592002801499650004901527650001101576650000901587650002301596650001101619700001601630700002101646700001801667700002101685773013101706856007501837852000901912655001201921IND60538521620221122002548.0160815e20120502xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053852162DNAL7 a10.1021/ja301338d2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFeng, Xiaowen10aSlow Magnetic Relaxation Induced by a Large Transverse Zero-Field Splitting in a MnIIReIV(CN)2 Single-Chain Magnet  ap. 7521-7529.  aThe model compounds (NBu₄)₂[ReCl₄(CN)₂] (1), (DMF)₄ZnReCl₄(CN)₂ (2), and [(PY5Me₂)₂Mn₂ReCl₄(CN)₂](PF₆)₂ (3) have been synthesized to probe the origin of the magnetic anisotropy barrier in the one-dimensional coordination solid (DMF)₄MnReCl₄(CN)₂ (4). High-field electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy reveals the presence of an easy-plane anisotropy (D > 0) with a significant transverse component, E, in compounds 1–3. These findings indicate that the onset of one-dimensional spin correlations within the chain compound 4 leads to a suppression of quantum tunneling of the magnetization within the easy plane, resulting in magnetic bistability and slow relaxation behavior. Within this picture, it is the transverse E term associated with the Reᴵⱽ centers that determines the easy axis and the anisotropy energy scale associated with the relaxation barrier. The results demonstrate for the first time that slow magnetic relaxation can be achieved through optimization of the transverse anisotropy associated with magnetic ions that possess easy-plane anisotropy, thus providing a new direction in the design of single-molecule and single-chain magnets.  aPublisher supplied data 3aelectron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aenergy 3aions 3amagnetic materials 3amodels1 aLiu, Junjie1 aHarris, T.

Simultaneous monitoring of the parasite and bacterial dynamics is important when studying these interactions. PCR based methods of genomic DNA (gDNA) have been widely used, but their inability to discriminate between live and dead cells compromises their application. The alternative method of quantification of mRNA mainly reports on cell activity rather than density. METHOD: Quantitative real-time (qrt) PCR in combination with Propidium Monoazide (PMA) treatment (PMA-qrtPCR) has been previously used for selectively enumerating viable microbial cells. PMA penetrates damaged cell membranes and intercalates in the DNA inhibiting its PCR amplification. Here, we tested the potential of PMA-qrtPCR to discriminate between and quantify live and dead Plasmodium berghei malarial parasites and commensal bacteria in the midgut of Anopheles coluzzii Coetzee & Wilkerson 2013 (formerly An. gambiae M-form). RESULTS: By combining microscopic observations with reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) we reveal that, in addition to gDNA, mRNA from dead parasites also persists inside the mosquito midgut, therefore its quantification cannot accurately reflect live-only parasites at the time of monitoring. In contrast, pre-treating the samples with PMA selectively inhibited qrtPCR amplification of parasite gDNA, with about 15 cycles (Ct-value) difference between PMA-treated and control samples. The limit of detection corresponds to 10 Plasmodium ookinetes. Finally, we show that the PMA-qrtPCR method can be used to quantify bacteria that are present in the mosquito midgut. CONCLUSION: The PMA-qrtPCR is a suitable method for quantification of viable parasites and bacteria in the midgut of Anopheles mosquitoes. The method will be valuable when studying the molecular interactions between the mosquito, the malaria parasite and midgut microbiota.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAnopheles 3aDNA 3aPlasmodium berghei 3abacteria 3acell membranes 3adetection limit 3agenomics 3aimmune response 3amalaria 3amessenger RNA 3amicroscopy 3amidgut 3amonitoring 3aookinetes 3aparasites 3apretreatment 3apropidium 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction1 aGroom, Zoe1 aDuchateau, Luc1 aChristophides, George K.0 tParasites & vectors.g2015 Dec., v. 8, no. 1 p.455-455dBioMed Centralx1756-33057nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13071-015-1087-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03215naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100001600166245019500182300001600377520162200393592002802015650001302043650001102056650001902067650002502086650001502111650001202126650002102138650001302159650001402172650002802186650001902214650001702233651001002250653004302260653001202303653002102315653001602336700001902352700001802371700001702389700001402406700001902420700001702439700001402456773013702470856008102607852000902688655001202697IND60650368520221122000709.0190710e20170928xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065036852DNAL7 a289808912pmid7 a10.1017/S000711451700229X2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKang, Yijun10aMulti-micronutrient supplementation during pregnancy for prevention of maternal anaemia and adverse birth outcomes in a high-altitude area: a prospective cohort study in rural Tibet of China  ap. 431-440.  aAnaemia during pregnancy, characterised by Hb <110 g/l, is a specific risk factor for adverse maternal and perinatal outcomes in developing countries. The objective of this study was to determine the effectiveness of daily antenatal supplementation with multiple micronutrients (MMN) compared with folic acid (FA) on the occurrence of anaemia among pregnant women and their infants’ health in a high-altitude area. A prospective cohort study was carried out in two rural counties in Tibet from 2007 to 2012. A total of 1149 eligible pregnant women were allocated daily supplementation with FA in one county and MMN containing a recommended allowance of twenty-three vitamins and minerals in another county starting ≤24 weeks of gestation and continuing until delivery. Compared with the FA group, prenatal supplementation with MMN was significantly associated with reduced odds of anaemia in the third trimester. This was demonstrated in the primary outcome, with an adjusted OR (AOR) of 0·63; 95 % CI 0·45, 0·88 and P=0·007 and also reduced odds of preterm delivery (AOR: 0·31; 95 % CI 0·15, 0·61; P=0·001). There was no difference between MMN and FA groups in mean birth weight (adjusted mean difference: 36·78; 95 % CI −19·42, 92·98 g; P=0·200), whereas MMN supplementation significantly reduced the odds of low-birth weight (LBW) babies (AOR: 0·58; 95 % CI 0·36, 0·91; P=0·019). In conclusion, the antenatal MMN supplementation in rural Tibet is associated with a reduction of maternal anaemia in the third trimester, and may potentially decrease the risk of preterm delivery and LBW babies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaltitude 3aanemia 3acohort studies 3adeveloping countries 3afolic acid 3ainfants 3alow birth weight 3aminerals 3apregnancy 3apregnancy complications 3apregnant women 3arisk factors 3aChina 0aMultiple micronutrient supplementation 0aAnaemia 0aPreterm delivery 0aRural Tibet1 aDang, Shaonong1 aZeng, Lingxia1 aWang, Duolao1 aLi, Qiang1 aWang, Jianpeng1 aOuzhu, Luobu1 aYan, Hong0 tBritish journal of nutrition.g2017 Sept. 28, v. 118, no. 6 p.431-440dCambridge University PresswJournal:jnl45200x1475-26627nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S000711451700229X3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02584naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001700139245010700156300001800263520132400281592002801605650002201633650001501655650001101670650002001681650002101701650001801722650001401740650001401754650002001768650001701788650001201805700001901817700002801836700002801864700002101892700002701913700002601940773011201966856007502078852000902153655001202162IND60529845220170412000000.0160720e20140916xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052984522DNAL7 a10.1021/ac50180562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMiodek, Anna10aElectrochemical Detection of the Oligomerization of PB1-F2 Influenza A Virus Protein in Infected Cells  ap. 9098-9105.  aPB1-F2 is a nonstructural accessory protein of Influenza A virus described to enhance the mortality and the morbidity of the virus in a host-dependent manner. In this work, an electrochemical biosensor based on an immunodetection system was developed to follow the oligomerization of PB1-F2 during the viral cycle. The immunosensor was based on conductive polypyrrole modified with ferrocenyl groups as a redox marker for enhancing signal detection. Antibodies specific for monomeric or oligomeric PB1-F2 forms were immobilized on polypyrrole matrix via biotin/streptavidin layer. We demonstrated that this electrochemical biosensor sensitively detects PB1-F2 in both conformational forms. The linear range extends from 5 nM to 1.5 μM and from 5 nM to 0.5 μM for monomeric and oligomeric PB1-F2, respectively. The calculated limit of detection was 0.42 nM for monomeric PB1-F2 and 16 nM for oligomers. The biosensor platform allows the detection and quantification of PB1-F2 in lysates of infected cells during viral cycle. We show that at early stages of viral cycle, PB1-F2 is mainly monomeric but switched to amyloid-like structures at a later stage of infection. The quantification of two protein structural forms points out that PB1-F2 expression profiles and kinetics of oligomerization are cell-type-dependent.  aPublisher supplied data 3aInfluenza A virus 3aantibodies 3abiotin 3adetection limit 3aelectrochemistry 3aimmunosensors 3amorbidity 3amortality 3aoligomerization 3astreptavidin 3aviruses1 aVidic, Jasmina1 aSauriat-Dorizon, Helene1 aRichard, Charles-Adrien1 aLe Goffic, Ronan1 aKorri-Youssoufi, Hafsa1 aChevalier, Christophe0 tAnalytical chemistry.g2014 Sept. 16, v. 86, no. 18 p.9098-9105dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-68827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fac50180563Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02119naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100002300141245007900164520121700243592002801460650001101488650001201499650001901511650001901530650001801549650001201567651001101579700002401590773011901614856007501733852000901808655001201817IND60715294120221118005904.0201026e20200924xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071529412DNAL7 a10.3390/land91003512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKalbarczyk, Eliza 10aTypology of Climate Change Adaptation Measures in Polish Cities up to 2030  aPoland, like other countries in the world, increasingly experiences the ongoing climate change. However, the level of preparation of the country and its society for climate change in the second decade of the 21st century can be evaluated as low. The Municipal Adaptation Plans (MAPs) created in 2017–2019 became a subject of research studies whose main goal was to determine the typology of adaptation actions to be undertaken as part of MAPs in the 14 selected Polish cities in various geographical regions. Moreover, the type and scope of intended actions were analysed according to the planned amount of expenditure and from the perspective of sectors. The tasks accepted for implementation up to 2030 mainly relate to modernisation and development of transport systems and to actions connected with physical infrastructure. A large number of tasks and even a bigger scale of financial sources planned in the analysed MAPs for mitigation actions show that Polish cities are at an initial stage of actions for climate protection. The typology of adaptation actions which the work proposes may be helpful in research carried out in countries of a similar level of preparation for adaptation to climate change.  aPublisher supplied data 3acities 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3ainfrastructure 3amodernization 3asociety 3aPoland1 aKalbarczyk, Robert 0 tLand.g2020 Sept. 24, v. 9, no. 10dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21555x2073-445X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/land91003513Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02591naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002200139245008800161520158200249592002801831650001701859650001301876650000901889650001001898650001701908650002101925651001501946700002401961700001801985700002002003700002702023773012002050856007402170852000902244655001202253IND60787913620221117221447.0220811e20220729xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078791362DNAL7 a10.3390/w141523412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSabie, Robert P.,10aConceptual Framework for Modeling Dynamic Complexities in Produced Water Management  aThis research addresses a gap in the produced water management (PWM) literature by providing a conceptual framework to describe the connections of PWM to regional water budgets. We use southeastern New Mexico as a case study, because the region is facing looming shortfalls in water availability, and oil and gas production generate high volumes of produced water in the region. The framework was developed through expert interviews, analysis of industry data, and information gained at industry meetings; it is supported by detailed descriptions of material flows, information flows, and PWM decisions. Produced water management decisions may be connected to regional water budgets through dynamic complexities; however, modeling efforts exploring PWM often do not capture this complexity. Instead, PWM is most often based on the least expensive management and disposal alternatives, without considering short and long-term impacts to the regional water budget. On the other hand, regional water budgets do not include treated produced water as a potential resource, thus missing opportunities for exploring the impact of potential beneficial reuse. This is particularly important when there is a need to address water shortages in chronically water-short regions of the United States. At the same time, oil and gas production in the western United States is challenged by the need to dispose of large volumes of produced water. The framework is useful for developing improved models of PWM to identify the impact of alternative management decisions on regional water budgets.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase studies 3aindustry 3aoils 3awater 3awater budget 3awater management 3aNew Mexico1 aLangarudi, Saeed P.1 aPerez, Kevin 1 aThomson, Bruce 1 aFernald, Alexander G.,0 tWater.g2022 July 29, v. 14, no. 15dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21688x2073-44417nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w141523413Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02512naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094024002200125024001900147040001800166100002400184245004500208506007600253520129500329592002801624506003701652650001701689650001701706650002701723650001801750650001301768650001101781650002601792650002001818650001201838650002601850700001701876700001601893773011901909856007702028852000902105655001202114IND60660535120221207070609.0190823e20190730xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066053512DNAL7 a10.3390/plants80802552doi7 aPMC67241082pmcid7 a313660662pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMillar, Anthony  A.10aBiology and Function of miR159 in Plants  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aMicroR159 (miR159) is ancient, being present in the majority of land plants where it targets a class of regulatory genes called GAMYB or GAMYB-like via highly conserved miR159-binding sites. These GAMYB genes encode R2R3 MYB domain transcription factors that transduce the gibberellin (GA) signal in the seed aleurone and the anther tapetum. Here, GAMYB plays a conserved role in promoting the programmed cell death of these tissues, where miR159 function appears weak. By contrast, GAMYB is not involved in GA-signaling in vegetative tissues, but rather its expression is deleterious, leading to the inhibition of growth and development. Here, the major function of miR159 is to mediate strong silencing of GAMYB to enable normal growth. Highlighting this requirement of strong silencing are conserved RNA secondary structures associated with the miR159-binding site in GAMYB mRNA that promotes miR159-mediated repression. Although the miR159-GAMYB pathway in vegetative tissues has been implicated in a number of different functions, presently no conserved role for this pathway has emerged. We will review the current knowledge of the different proposed functions of miR159, and how this ancient pathway has been used as a model to help form our understanding of miRNA biology in plants.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aembryophytes 3agibberellins 3agrowth and development 3amessenger RNA 3amicroRNA 3amodels 3aprogrammed cell death 3aregulator genes 3atissues 3atranscription factors1 aLohe, Allan 1 aWong, Gigi 0 tPlants.g2019 July 30, v. 8, no. 8dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21620x2223-77477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/plants80802553Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03227naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100007000140245014100210300001800351520178900369592002802158650002502186650002502211650002802236650001902264650001702283650002002300650001302320650003002333650001902363650001102382650001802393650000902411650001202420650002102432650001402453700001302467700001602480700001502496700001402511700002002525773014102545856007402686852000902760655001202769IND60645163120221119153041.0190523e20190522xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064516312DNAL7 a10.1039/c9tb00417c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYuThe first two authors contributed equally to this work., Shuang12aA mechanically robust and flexible PEGylated poly(glycerol sebacate)/β-TCP nanoparticle composite membrane for guided bone regeneration  ap. 3279-3290.  aThe treatment of bone defects in the field of periodontology and oral implantology has been a major clinical problem to date. Guided bone regeneration (GBR), based on ideal barrier membranes to provide space maintenance and selectively promote the regeneration of the damaged area by prevention of invasion by the fibrous tissues, represents the most promising strategy at present. In this study, the mechanically robust and flexible membrane PEGylated poly(glycerol sebacate) (PEGS) coordinated by β-TCP nanoparticles (PEGS/β-TCP) was developed by a simple prepolymer mixing-in situ crosslinking method. By tailoring the content of β-TCP (0, 10, 50, and 90 wt% relative to the prepolymer), the resultant PEGS/β-TCP composite membranes exhibited controllable degradation rate and reinforced mechanical properties. The maximum tensile strength of 9.58 ± 0.02 MPa was presented by the P20T50 group (weight ratio of β-TCP to PEGS20 prepolymer was 50%), about 1.5-fold higher than that of P20T0 without β-TCP. For cellular responses, the PEGS/β-TCP membranes showed desirable cell attachment and viability on rat bone mesenchymal stem cells (rBMSCs). The incorporation of β-TCP definitely enhanced the alkaline phosphatase activity and promoted mineralization, thus facilitating the osteogenic differentiation. The in vivo result obtained for the rat calvarial defect model reaffirmed the favorable bone regenerative ability of the fabricated membranes, especially for P20T50 with the highest bone volume/tissue volume ratio (BV/TV) at both 4 weeks (17.26 ± 1.49%) and 8 weeks (23.24 ± 2.85%) after the surgery. Therefore, the PEGS/β-TCP composite membranes prepared by this prepolymer mixing-in situ crosslinking process will be a prospective biomaterial for the GBR therapy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalkaline phosphatase 3aasymmetric membranes 3abiocompatible materials 3abone formation 3acrosslinking 3aenzyme activity 3aglycerol 3amesenchymal stromal cells 3amineralization 3amodels 3ananoparticles 3arats 3asurgery 3atensile strength 3aviability1 aShi, Jun1 aLiu, Yutong1 aSi, Jiawen1 aYuanyuan,1 aLiu, Changsheng0 tJournal of materials chemistry B.g2019 May 22, v. 7, no. 20 p.3279-3290dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26902x2050-75187nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c9tb00417c3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03096naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094024002200121024001900143040001800162100002900180245010600209300001600315500002000331506007600351520133200427592002801759596001901787506003701806650001401843650002301857650001601880650000901896650002201905650002401927650002201951650001301973650001401986650002902000650001502029650001102044700007002055700002802125700002102153700003002174700002802204700003402232700002802266700006502294773012502359856007302484852000902557655001202566IND60638232920221207062503.0190426e201905  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063823292DNAL7 a10.1111/asj.131832doi7 aPMC65940342pmcid7 a309011392pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLeite, Rhaony Gonçalves10aOrganic additives used in beef cattle feedlot: Effects on metabolic parameters and animal performance  ap. 628-636.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aOrganic additives are recently being used in animal diets owing to their ability to control metabolic issues and result in better animal performance. Specifically, the organic additive Fator P® presents an additional advantage that is to cause a lesser greenhouse gas emission. This study evaluated whether Fator P® intake changes ruminal parameters or animal performance of beef cattle. Evaluations were carried out in a feedlot experiment divided into growing (46 days; two diets [control mix—CM and standard mix—SM] and finishing (lasted 83 days; four diets: CM, SM, Fator P® + virginiamycin, and Fator P® alone [FP]) trials. Animal performance study involved 48 animals allocated to 12 collective pens in completely randomized experimental design. Ruminal parameters were evaluated in separate metabolism study developed carried out using individual pen with four steers. During growing trial, FP diet resulted in higher (p < 0.05) dry matter intake (DMI) and ruminating time. In the finishing trial, diets containing Fator P® resulted in higher DMI than obtained with CM. Most of the ruminal parameters did not differ (p > 0.05) among dietary treatments. Therefore, Fator P® represents a viable and safe strategy for supplementation to beef cattle finished using high‐concentrate diet in feedlot systems.  aPublisher supplied data  cPremix Company0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aadditives 3aanimal performance 3abeef cattle 3adiet 3adry matter intake 3aexperimental design 3afeed concentrates 3afeedlots 3afinishing 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3ametabolism 3asteers1 aRomanzini, Eliéder Prates1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5109-30491 aDelevatti, Lutti Maneck1 aHoffmann, Alvair1 aFerrari, Adriana Cristina1 aD'Aurea, André Pastori1 aFernandes, Lauriston Bertelli1 aOliveira, Amanda Prates1 aReis, Ricardo Andrade1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4709-30940 tAnimal science journal =.g2019 May, v. 90, no. 5 p.628-636dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3867063x1344-39417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/asj.131833Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02228naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002000144245008300164300001600247520104200263592002801305650001801333650001401351650002301365650001001388650001301398650001001411650001901421650001101440650002201451650001101473651001601484653001801500653002301518653002201541653002301563700001801586773012501604856008001729852000901809655001201818IND60477691720221121052526.0160105s2009    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6047769172DNAL7 a10.18475/cjos.v45i2.a92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFlynn, Kathleen10aVariability of aspergillosis in Gorgonia ventalina in La Parguera, Puerto Rico  ap. 215-220.  aTemporal and spatial variability of prevalence of the fungal disease aspergillosis (ASP) affecting Gorgonia ventalina colonies was assessed at several reef sites in La Parguera, southwest Puerto Rico. During 2005 and 2006, all G. ventalina colonies were checked for signs of ASP twice a year, within permanent 20 m² (10×2m) band transects at each of six sites located in three reef zones. Overall, there was high variability in disease prevalence in both space and time (0–28%). The average prevalence of ASP increased significantly from 5.1 ± 9.5% in March 2005 to 14.4 ± 16.0% in September 2006. There was no consistent temporal trend in ASP prevalence affecting all reefs, but shelf-edge reefs had significantly lower prevalence than inner and/or mid-shelf reefs in all sampling periods. Higher disease prevalence found in shallower areas may be related to higher water temperatures in these habitats, and unseasonably high temperatures during the winter and spring of 2006 associated with the extensive bleaching event of 2005.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaspergillosis 3ableaching 3adisease prevalence 3afungi 3ahabitats 3areefs 3aspace and time 3aspring 3awater temperature 3awinter 3aPuerto Rico 0aaspergillosis 0aGorgonia ventalina 0aoctocoral disease 0adisease prevalence1 aWeil, Ernesto0 tCaribbean journal of science.g2009, v. 45, no. 2–3 p.215-220dUniversity of Puerto Rico at Mayagüezx0008-64527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.18475%2Fcjos.v45i2.a93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02210naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002000140245004600160300002000206520124900226592002801475650001301503650001501516650000901531650002201540650001101562650001301573650001801586700001801604700002001622700002201642773012501664856007401789852000901863655001201872IND60666735120221120075845.0190919e20141114xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066673512DNAL7 a10.1039/c4ra06409g2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aÖzdemir, Abdil12aA deeper look into sonic spray ionization  ap. 61290-61297.  aSonic spray ionization (SSI) has been explored as an ambient ionization method for mass spectrometric analysis of different compounds. It has been applied to the analysis of different groups of compounds, mostly small molecules. The work reported in this paper extends the ionization efficiency of SSI and application of SSI to different groups of compounds, mostly biomolecules, in an ion trap mass spectrometer. SSI does not use any power supply and produces both positive and negative ions simultaneously. The most important parameters in SSI are gas pressure, solvent flow rate and physical dimensions of the spray device. Although the first two parameters have been investigated by different groups, the effect of physical dimensions has not been reported in the literature. Silica capillary inner diameter (ID) and outer diameter (OD) and ID of the cone play important roles in a spray. The best explored dimensions for the silica capillary are 150–200 μm OD and 40–75 μm ID and 350 μm ID for the cone. These physical dimensions provide the best ionization efficiency and spectra of large proteins such as albumin can be obtained. The spectra of the samples can also be collected in water without adding any acid into the solution.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalbumins 3aionization 3aions 3amass spectrometry 3asilica 3asolvents 3aspectrometers1 aLin, Jung-Lee1 aWang, Yi-Sheng,1 aChen, Chung-Hsuan0 tRSC advances.g2014 Nov. 14, v. 4, no. 106 p.61290-61297dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c4ra06409g3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02760naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001200152245009300164300001600257520151000273592002801783650001601811650001401827650001501841650001901856653001401875653002101889653002401910653001901934653001501953700005501968700005202023700001602075700001902091700001602110700001602126700001402142773009802156856008702254852000902341655001202350IND60616107020221122060632.0181120e20181201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061610702DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apenergy.2018.09.1342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLu, Pei10aAnalysis of pressure drop in T-junction and its effect on thermodynamic cycle efficiency  ap. 468-480.  aThe application of T-junction has already been extended from the petroleum engineering to the emerging advanced thermodynamic cycles. How a T-junction, as a separator in an emerging thermodynamic cycle, affects the cycle efficiency is discussed in this paper. Firstly, based on the Eulerian method, parametric studies on the local pressure drop coefficients are conducted and two new local pressure drop (LPD) coefficients are predicted in this paper. Then, the effects of pressure drop on a composition adjustable organic Rankine cycle efficiency is analyzed. In the process, a composition adjustable organic Rankine cycle with zeotropic mixtures R245fa/R123 is chosen to calculate the effects of pressure drop on thermodynamic cycle efficiency. The quality of the outlet of the evaporator is assumed as 0.7, and the composition ratio as 0.6/0.4. The results show that the pressure variation of T-junction affects the adjustable organic Rankine cycle efficiency, and reasonable phase separation ratio can improve the thermodynamic cycle efficiency. The pressure drop could cause composition diffusion. In addition, two new local pressure drop coefficients are obtained. And the results demonstrate that K12J declines slowly with the increases of density ratio (ρ2/ρ1) and decreases with the increases of mass fraction of taken off (F). K13J shows an obvious trend with diameter ratio (d3/d1) and F. This work could push the research of T-junction as a separator in the adjustable organic Rankine cycle.  aPublisher supplied data 3aengineering 3apetroleum 3aseparation 3athermodynamics 0aSeparator 0aCycle efficiency 0aLocal pressure drop 0aTwo-phase flow 0aT-junction1 aDeng, Shuai1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2365-19441 aZhao, Li1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6269-67821 aShao, Yawei1 aZhao, Dongpeng1 aXu, Weicong1 aZhang, Ying1 aWang, Zhi0 tApplied energy.g2018 Dec. 01, v. 231 p.468-480dElsevier LtdwJournal:11876x0306-26197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2018.09.1343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02473naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100001900141245015700160520116900317592002801486650001201514650001501526650002201541650001901563650001701582651001901599700002201618700002301640700001901663700002101682700002101703700002201724700002201746700002601768700001901794700002001813700002701833773011901860856007501979852000902054655001202063IND60715294220221118010214.0201026e20200925xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071529422DNAL7 a10.3390/land91003522doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKelly, Claire 10a‘Mind the Gap’: Reconnecting Local Actions and Multi-Level Policies to Bridge the Governance Gap. An Example of Soil Erosion Action from East Africa  aAchieving change to address soil erosion has been a global yet elusive goal for decades. Efforts to implement effective solutions have often fallen short due to a lack of sustained, context-appropriate and multi-disciplinary engagement with the problem. Issues include prevalence of short-term funding for ‘quick-fix’ solutions; a lack of nuanced understandings of institutional, socio-economic or cultural drivers of erosion problems; little community engagement in design and testing solutions; and, critically, a lack of traction in integrating locally designed solutions into policy and institutional processes. This paper focusses on the latter issue of local action for policy integration, drawing on experiences from a Tanzanian context to highlight the practical and institutional disjuncts that exist; and the governance challenges that can hamper efforts to address and build resilience to soil erosion. By understanding context-specific governance processes, and joining them with realistic, locally designed actions, positive change has occurred, strengthening local-regional resilience to complex and seemingly intractable soil erosion challenges.  aPublisher supplied data 3afunding 3agovernance 3aissues and policy 3asocioeconomics 3asoil erosion 3aEastern Africa1 aWynants, Maarten 1 aMunishi, Linus  K.1 aNasseri, Mona 1 aPatrick, Aloyce 1 aMtei, Kelvin  M.1 aMkilema, Francis 1 aRabinovich, Anna 1 aGilvear, D.q(David),1 aWilson, Geoff 1 aBlake, William 1 aNdakidemi, Patrick  A.0 tLand.g2020 Sept. 25, v. 9, no. 10dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21555x2073-445X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/land91003523Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03205naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100003200151245009800183500001400281520195800295592002802253650001602281650001502297650001002312650001202322650001902334650002402353650002802377650002702405653003902432653003002471653000902501653002202510653002902532700002202561700001602583773011302599856008602712852000902798655001202807IND60720058420221122034358.0210121e20210220xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072005842DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.1253192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 avan der Waal, Johannes W.H.14aThe innovative contribution of multinational enterprises to the Sustainable Development Goals  aNAL-light  aThe 2030 Agenda recognizes the role of the private sector and calls on its innovative and creative capabilities to help solve sustainable development challenges. Judging by the embracement of the SDGs in sustainability reporting, this call seems to resonate. However, the extent to which companies actually make a contribution to solving SDG challenges remains unclear.This paper aims to explore this innovative contribution to the SDGs. It does so by assessing the level of SDG relevant innovation by the largest multinational enterprises in the world.We develop a method for the identification of SDG relevant patent applications, distinguishing between “green” patents, related to environmental themes, and “blue” patents, related to “improving conditions” and meeting unmet sustainable development needs. In addition, we explore whether the level of SDG relevant innovation is systematically associated with a number of company characteristics.Our results show that large MNEs have similar levels of green patents, and lower levels of blue patents, compared to smaller companies. Using regression analysis, we find that there are regional and industry-specific differences. Corporate sustainable development attributes such as Global Compact membership and sustainability reporting, are less convincingly associated. It can be concluded that MNEs play an important role in SDG relevant innovation, but that there are trade-offs between different SDGs. Some SDG relevant innovation is not commonly associated with sustainable development.This study attempts to quantify the actual effect of sustainability strategies of companies by identifying their sustainable patents and associates this to company characteristics, using a new method for sustainable patent identification. Moreover, SDG relevant innovation is taken beyond green innovation to include the whole range of technical innovation that is related to the broad range of SDGs.  aPublisher supplied data 3amethodology 3aobjectives 3apaper 3apatents 3aprivate sector 3aregression analysis 3asustainable development 3asustainable technology 0asustainability-oriented innovation 0amultinational enterprises 0aSDGs 0aglobal challenges 0asustainability reporting1 aThijssens, Thomas1 aMaas, Karen0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2021 Feb. 20, v. 285 p.125319-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.1253193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02644naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002200139245009500161520165000256592002801906650001501934650001701949650002201966650001101988650001001999650002002009700002102029700002302050700002302073700001902096773012002115856007402235852000902309655001202318IND60787913720221117221316.0220811e20220729xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078791372DNAL7 a10.3390/w141523422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMeleshko, Alexey 10aVisualization Assisted Approach to Anomaly and Attack Detection in Water Treatment Systems  aThe specificity of the water treatment field, associated with water transmission, distribution and accounting, as well as the need to use automation and intelligent tools for various information solutions and security tools, have resulted in the development of integrated approaches and practical solutions regarding various aspects of the functioning of such systems. The research problem lies in the insecurity of water treatment systems and their susceptibility to malicious influences from the side of potential intruders trying to compromise the functioning. To obtain initial data needed for assessing the states of a water treatment system, the authors have developed a case study presenting a combination of a physical model and a software simulator. The methodology proposed in the article includes combining methods of machine learning and visual data analysis to improve the detection of attacks and anomalies in water treatment systems. The selection of the methods and tuning of their modes and parameters made it possible to build a mechanism for efficient detection of attacks in data from sensors with accuracy values above 0.95 for each class of attack and mixed data. In addition, Change_Measure metric parameters were selected to ensure the detection of attacks and anomalies by using visual data analysis. The combined method allows identifying points when the functioning of the system changes, which could be used as a trigger to start resource-intensive procedures of manual and/or machine-assisted checking of the system state on the basis of the available machine learning models that involve processing big data arrays.  aPublisher supplied data 3aautomation 3acase studies 3acomputer software 3amodels 3awater 3awater treatment1 aShulepov, Anton 1 aDesnitsky, Vasily 1 aNovikova, Evgenia 1 aKotenko, Igor 0 tWater.g2022 July 29, v. 14, no. 15dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21688x2073-44417nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w141523423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02017naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002600148245009800174300001600272520088400288592002801172650001401200650001201214650001701226650001301243650001301256650001301269650001901282650001101301650001401312650001101326650001401337650001001351650001801361651001101379700002901390773010901419856008201528852000901610655001201619IND60085283020221122061324.0141101e201301  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008528302DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jaap.2012.10.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSkoulou, Vassiliki K.10aCo-gasification of crude glycerol with lignocellulosic biomass for enhanced syngas production  ap. 110-116.  aThe present work concerns the co-gasification of crude glycerol (CG), a by-product of biodiesel industry, with locally available lignocellulosic biomass aiming at the production of syngas and further promotion of power production in dedicated bioenergy units. Co-gasification of CG with olive kernel (OK), an agro-residue issued from the intensive olive oil production sector in Southern East Europe, was performed in a laboratory fixed bed reactor at T=750–850οC with λ=0.2–0.4 and in the three different mixing levels of 24wt%, 32wt% and 49wt% of CG in OK. Co-gasification of CG with OK found to favor the gas yield which increased from 0.4 to 1.2Nm³/kg for the mixture of 49wt% of CG in biomass. Additionally H₂ concentration increased from 19 to 33%(v/v) in the gasification gas while the tar yield decreased from 19.5 to 2.4wt% at conditions of T=850οC and λ=0.4.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiodiesel 3abiomass 3agasification 3aglycerol 3ahydrogen 3aindustry 3alignocellulose 3amixing 3aolive oil 3aolives 3apyrolysis 3aseeds 3asynthesis gas 3aEurope1 aZabaniotou, Anastasia A.0 tJournal of analytical and applied pyrolysis.g2013 Jan., v. 99 p.110-116dElsevier B.V.x0165-23707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jaap.2012.10.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02748naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100005900139245008700198300001600285500002000301520127200321592002801593650001301621650001901634650002501653650001701678650001001695650000901705650002701714650001901741650001201760650002301772650001701795650001601812650001201828650001801840650001501858650001201873650004401885700001801929700002201947700004101969700001902010700001802029773012502047856007302172852000902245655001202254IND60638233020221119085118.0190426e201905  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063823302DNAL7 a10.1111/asj.131942doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMancini, Simone1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8643-507X14aThe influence of dietary chestnut and quebracho tannins mix on rabbit meat quality  ap. 680-689.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aTannins were recently evaluated as feed additives in order to increase antioxidant compounds in animal diet, mainly to enhance resistance to lipid oxidation in meat. Rabbit meat is one of the most susceptible animal products, thus the main aim of this study was to evaluate the capacity of tannins to elongate shelf life of rabbit meat. Ninety hybrid rabbits were fed with three different diets: basal diet (control, C) and basal diet supplemented with 0.3% or 0.6% of tannins mix. Meat samples were refrigerated as raw at 4°C up to 11 days and analysed both as raw and cooked for physical‐chemical characteristics, fatty acids profile, lipid oxidation and antioxidant capacity. Results showed that dietary tannins affected meat colour of raw samples (mostly yellowness). Lipid peroxidation (TBARS) of raw samples was lower in tannins group than C group; a further inhibition of peroxidation was showed also in cooked samples only by the highest dose of tannins mix. Moreover, antioxidant capacity (ABTS) of raw samples increased with the percentage of tannins. In conclusion, supplementation with 0.6% of tannins mix seems to positively affect the lipid peroxidation and antioxidant capacity of meat without modifying the intrinsic characteristics of rabbit meat.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCastanea 3aanimal feeding 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3acolor 3adiet 3afatty acid composition 3afeed additives 3ahybrids 3alipid peroxidation 3ameat quality 3arabbit meat 3arabbits 3arefrigeration 3ashelf life 3atannins 3athiobarbituric acid-reactive substances1 aMinieri, Sara1 aBuccioni, Arianna1 aMarzoni Fecia di Cossato, Margherita1 aRusso, Claudia1 aPaci, Gisella0 tAnimal science journal =.g2019 May, v. 90, no. 5 p.680-689dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3867063x1344-39417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/asj.131943Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02563naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245011700167300001600284520102900300592002801329650004401357650001301401650001801414650001401432650002201446650001801468650002601486650001701512650003301529650001701562650003701579650001701616650001601633653003601649653001201685653002001697653002901717653003401746700001401780700002101794700001901815700001401834700001801848773010801866856008601974852000902060655001202069IND60540858720221122063254.0190318e20150315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054085872DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbpol.2014.11.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWei, Xueqin10aStructure and properties of moisture-resistant konjac glucomannan films coated with shellac/stearic acid coating  ap. 119-125.  aA series of moisture-resistant konjac glucomannan films were prepared by coating shellac/stearic acid emulsion on deacetylated konjac glucomannan films (dKGM). The effect of stearic acid content on structure and properties of the coated films were investigated by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE SEM), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), ultraviolet spectroscopy (UV), water vapor permeability (WVP), water uptake, water contact angle, and tensile testing. The results revealed that shellac in the coating adhered intimately to the surface of dKGM film, and provided a substrate for the dispersion of stearic acid which played an important role in enhancement of the moisture barrier properties and mechanical properties of the coated films. The WVP of the coated films decreased from 2.63×10−11 to 0.37×10−11g/(msPa) and the water contact angle increased from 68° to 101.2° when stearic acid content increased from 0wt% to 40wt%, showing the potential applications in food preservation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3acoatings 3acontact angle 3aemulsions 3afood preservation 3akonjac mannan 3amechanical properties 3apermeability 3ascanning electron microscopy 3astearic acid 3aultraviolet-visible spectroscopy 3awater uptake 3awater vapor 0aDeacetylated konjac glucomannan 0aShellca 0aThe coated film 0aWater vapor permeability 0aMoisture-resistant properties1 aPang, Jie1 aZhang, Changfeng1 aYu, Chengcheng1 aChen, Han1 aXie, Bingqing0 tCarbohydrate polymers.g2015 Mar. 15, v. 118 p.119-125dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl47819x0144-86177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbpol.2014.11.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03152naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002500151245009000176300001400266520202100280592002802301650000902329650001102338650001202349650001302361651001602374653001402390653002102404653001702425653002602442653002702468653001602495700002002511700001902531700002002550773010102570856008602671852000902757655001202766IND60558449320221120193038.0190318e201708  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055844932DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fishres.2016.11.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTruesdell, Samuel B.10aEstimating multinomial effective sample size in catch-at-age and catch-at-size models  ap. 66-83.  aCatch-at-age or catch-at-size stock assessment models require specification of an effective sample size (ESS) as a weighting component for multinomial composition data. ESS weights these data relative to other data that are fit, and is not an estimable parameter within a model that uses a multinomial likelihood. The ESS is typically less than the actual sample size (the number of fish) because of factors such as sampling groups of fish (clusters) that are caught together. A common approach for specifying ESS is to iteratively re-fit the model, estimating ESS after each fit so that the standardized residual variance is “correct,” until ESS converges. We survey iterative methods for determining ESS for a multinomial likelihood and apply them to two Great Lakes whitefish stocks. We also propose an extension of such methods: (the Generalized Mean Approach – GMA) for the case where ESS is based on mean age (or length) to account for correlation structures among proportions. Our extension allows for greater flexibility in the relationship between ESS and sampling intensity. Our results show that the choice of ESS estimation method can impact assessment model results. Simulations (in the absence of correlation structures) showed that all the approaches to calculating effective sample size could provide reasonable results on average, however methods that estimated annual ESS independently across years were highly imprecise. In our simulations and application, methods: that did account for correlation structure in annual proportions produced lower ESS than those that did not and suggested that these methods are adjusting for a deviation from the multinomial correlation structure. We recommend using methods that adjust for correlation structures in the proportions, and either assuming a constant ESS or, when there is substantial inter-annual variation in sampling levels, assuming ESS is related to sampling intensity and using the GMA or a similar approach to estimate that relationship.  aPublisher supplied data 3afish 3amodels 3asurveys 3avariance 3aGreat Lakes 0aFisheries 0aStock assessment 0aCatch-at-age 0aEffective sample size 0aCoregonus clupeaformis 0aGreat lakes1 aBence, James R.1 aSyslo, John M.1 aEbener, Mark P.0 tFisheries research.g2017 Aug., v. 192 p.66-83dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl33528x0165-78367nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fishres.2016.11.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02246naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001000139245010500149300001600254500002000270520101000290592002801300650002101328650001401349650001001363650001401373650001501387650000901402650001601411650001901427650002501446650001801471650004301489650002501532700001101557700001301568700001501581700001001596700001001606773011401616856007301730852000901803655001201812IND60572104720221118013350.0170712e201706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057210472DNAL7 a10.1111/rda.129042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXi, H10aBax and Bcl‐2 are involved in the apoptosis induced by local testicular heating in the boar testis  ap. 359-365.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe aim of this study was to determine whether the effect of Bax and Bcl‐2 on the apoptosis of germ cells is caused by local testicular heating (42°C, 1 hr) in boar testis. The testes of three boars were exposed to 42°C for 1 hr. Three other boars were assigned as control (no heat treatment). After 6 hr of heat treatment, all boars were castrated and the testes were harvested. Immunohistochemical results showed that a redistribution of Bax was caused by heat stress, and Bcl‐2 was expressed in the cytoplasm and nucleus. Western blot analyses and quantitative real‐time polymerase chain reaction (QRT‐PCR) showed that the protein and mRNA levels of Bax and Bcl‐2 were increased after local testicular heating. The number of TUNEL‐positive cells was increased in the seminiferous tubules compared with the control after local testicular heating. These results suggested that local testicular heating induced the apoptosis of germ cells by regulating the Bax and Bcl‐2 protein levels.  aPublisher supplied data 3aWestern blotting 3aapoptosis 3aboars 3acytoplasm 3agerm cells 3aheat 3aheat stress 3aheat treatment 3aimmunohistochemistry 3amessenger RNA 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3aseminiferous tubules1 aFan, X1 aZhang, Z1 aLiang, Y.,1 aLi, Q1 aHe, J0 tReproduction in domestic animals.g2017 June, v. 52, no. 3 p.359-365dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx0936-67687nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/rda.129043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02419naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100003000139245012100169520134300290592002801633650001101661650001901672650001101691650000901702650000901711650001801720650001101738650001201749650001001761650001401771700002001785700002201805700002701827773012001854856007401974852000902048655001202057IND60787913820221117221351.0220811e20220729xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078791382DNAL7 a10.3390/w141523452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOrtega-Becerril, José A.10aWildfire-Induced Changes in Flood Risk in Recreational Canyoning Areas: Lessons from the 2017 Jerte Canyons Disaster  aFew studies identify potential hazards affecting canyoning. This activity has an increasing number of practitioners, and hence, a greater number of people are affected by potential natural hazards. Mountain rivers are located in places subject to several hydrological hazards; the risks are mostly connected with floods produced by intense storms or dam operation, but changes in hydrological factors may alter the usual basin behavior given even moderate or less severe storms. Data about flood events and the peak discharge of the 2017 flood in the two studied canyons were collected by means of a quick field survey of water levels after the flood, hydrological modeling, and soil analysis. The present research shows the dramatic consequences of a two-year return period storm affecting a guided group of canyoneers. A previous wildfire changed the soil, leading to hydrophobic conditions and increasing the flood effects. Peak discharge increased from 2 m³ s⁻¹ in normal conditions to 12 m³ s⁻¹ under a hydrophobic regime related to wildfire occurrence; moreover, a reduction in the time of concentration also occurred, pointing to a more powerful and dangerous flood event. In this paper, some hydrological recommendations are highlighted that will be helpful in recreational canyoning management, leading to safer practice.  aPublisher supplied data 3abasins 3ahydrophobicity 3apeople 3arisk 3asoil 3asoil analysis 3astorms 3asurveys 3awater 3awildfires1 aGarrote, Julio 1 aVicente, Álvaro 1 aMarqués, María José0 tWater.g2022 July 29, v. 14, no. 15dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21688x2073-44417nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w141523453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01968naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002100139245011000160300001800270520095900288592002801247650001401275650002301289650002301312650001101335650002201346700001801368700002701386700002601413773013101439856007501570852000901645655001201654IND60538521920221122002605.0160815e20120502xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053852192DNAL7 a10.1021/ja301415k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTon, Thi My

By taking advantage of the orthogonal modes of reactivity of the substrate through slight modification of the reaction conditions, a divergence in product selectivity was observed. In the presence of 1.2 equiv of the iminoiodane, amination of the allylic CH bond of the enolic form of the substrate, formed in situ through coordination to the Lewis acidic metal catalyst, was found to selectively occur and give the β-aminated adduct. On the other hand, increasing the amount of the nitrogen source from 1.2 to 2–3 equiv was discovered to result in preferential formal aziridination of the CC bond of the 2-alkyl substituent of the starting material and formation of the aziridine product.  aPublisher supplied data 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3achemical reactions 3acopper 3aorganic compounds1 aTejo, Ciputra1 aTiong, Diane Ling Ying1 aChan, Philip Wai Hong0 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2012 May 02, v. 134, no. 17 p.7344-7350dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fja301415k3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03013naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001200151245007600163520160000239592002801839650003001867650001601897650001301913650001201926650001901938650001701957650002501974650002301999650002302022650001202045650000902057650001102066650002402077650001302101650001202114650001602126651001002142653001502152653001302167653001502180653001102195653001902206700001602225700001402241700001802255700001402273773011302287856008602400852000902486655001202495IND60720058620221122034343.0210506e20210310xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072005862DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.1253322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuo, Ru10aLocal farmer’s perception and adaptive behavior toward climate change  aAgriculture is greatly influenced by climate change, especially in developing countries. Farmers are both the basic executors of agricultural adaptation and among the most vulnerable groups to climate change. However, the understanding on climate change perception and adaptive behavior of local farmers is still very limited. This study develops a binary logistic regression (BLR) model to explore the underlying principles of local farmer’s perception and adaptive behavior toward climate change, with a focus on influential farmers. Through a field survey with 117 head farmers from 89 farmers’ cooperatives in Chongming Island of China - the largest alluvial island in the world, we found that: 1) 92% of the respondents thought climate change is happening; 59% of the respondents thought climate change has an obvious impact on agriculture production; and 45% of the respondents had a plan for future adaptation. 2) Based on BLR analysis, it was found that 3 out of 16 factors have significant impacts on head farmer’s adaptive behavior toward climate change, including agricultural training, perceived temperature change, and education level. 3) The percentage of consistency (POC) is proposed to describe the performance of our BLR model. The overall POC of BLR model is 68.4%, with a higher POC (85.7%) for farmers who have no adaptive behavior. 4) Key measures to enhance local climate adaptation include an integrated and coordinated plan of farmer-level adaptation, tailored and specialized training programs, improvement of scientific research, and publicity of best practices.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural productivity 3aagriculture 3abehavior 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3acooperatives 3adeveloping countries 3aeducation programs 3aeducational status 3afarmers 3ahead 3amodels 3aregression analysis 3aresearch 3asurveys 3atemperature 3aChina 0aPerception 0aBehavior 0aAdaptation 0aFarmer 0aClimate change1 aLi, Yunyang1 aShang, Li1 aFeng, Cuiyang1 aWang, Xin0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2021 Mar. 10, v. 287 p.125332-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.1253323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02269naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001600140245011700156300001800273500002000291520103300311592002801344650002101372650001501393650002601408650001801434650001301452650002801465650001401493700001401507700001201521700001701533700001601550700001601566700001301582700001901595700001501614700001701629773011801646856007401764852000901838655001201847IND60595591620221118120622.0180605e201806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059559162DNAL7 a10.1111/febs.144452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Bing10aArf1 regulates the ER–mitochondria encounter structure (ERMES) in a reactive oxygen species‐dependent manner  ap. 2004-2018.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe Arf family of small GTP‐binding and ‐hydrolyzing proteins are some of the most important intracellular regulators of membrane dynamics. In this study, we identified the Golgi‐localized Arf family G protein Arf1 in Candida albicans and confirmed its conserved function in regulating the secretory pathway. Interestingly, deletion of ARF1 resulted in intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation, and induced formation of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)–mitochondria encounter structure (ERMES). Moreover, N‐acetylcysteine‐mediated ROS scavenging in the arf1Δ/Δ strain attenuated ERMES formation, indicating that intracellular ROS accumulation resulting from ARF1 deletion facilitated ERMES formation. In addition, Arf1 regulated many key physiological processes in C. albicans, including cell cycle progression, morphogenesis and virulence. This study uncovers a role for Arf family G proteins in regulating ERMES formation and sheds new light on the crucial contribution of ROS to membrane dynamics.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCandida albicans 3acell cycle 3aendoplasmic reticulum 3amorphogenesis 3aproteins 3areactive oxygen species 3avirulence1 aYu, Qilin1 aHuo, Da1 aLi, Jianrong1 aLiang, Chao1 aLi, Hongyue1 aYi, Xiao1 aXiao, Chenpeng1 aZhang, Dan1 aLi, Mingchun0 tFEBS journal.g2018 June, v. 285, no. 11 p.2004-2018dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3943524x1742-464X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/febs.144453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03160naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245009400164520129800258592002801556650000801584650002401592650002101616650002501637650001501662650001601677650002201693650002201715650002001737650002001757650003001777650001401807650002601821650001401847653002801861653003501889653002201924653002801946653002601974653002502000653003702025700002802062700002302090700001902113700002102132700001802153700005802171700002202229700003602251700002002287700006002307773012402367856008202491852000902573655001202582IND60754471920221120133454.0211106e20211130xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075447192DNAL7 a10.1016/j.abb.2021.1090602doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNeetu, Neetu10aDeciphering the enigma of missing DNA binding domain of LacI family transcription factors  aCatabolite repressor activator (Cra) is a member of the LacI family transcriptional regulator distributed across a wide range of bacteria and regulates the carbon metabolism and virulence gene expression. In numerous studies to crystallize the apo form of the LacI family transcription factor, the N-terminal domain (NTD), which functions as a DNA-binding domain, has been enigmatically missing from the final resolved structures. It was speculated that the NTD is disordered or unstable and gets cleaved during crystallization. Here, we have determined the crystal structure of Cra from Escherichia coli (EcCra). The structure revealed a well-defined electron density for the C-terminal domain (CTD). However, electron density was missing for the first 56 amino acids (NTD). Our data reveal for the first time that EcCra undergoes a spontaneous cleavage at the conserved Asn 50 (N50) site, which separates the N-terminal DNA binding domain from the C-terminal effector molecule binding domain. With the site-directed mutagenesis, we confirm the involvement of residue N50 in the spontaneous cleavage phenomenon. Furthermore, the Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) assay of the EcCra-NTD with DNA showed EcCra-NTD is in a functional conformation state and retains its DNA binding activity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aDNA-binding domains 3aEscherichia coli 3aamino acid sequences 3abiophysics 3acalorimetry 3acarbon metabolism 3acrystal structure 3acrystallization 3agene expression 3asite-directed mutagenesis 3atitration 3atranscription factors 3avirulence 0aTranscription regulator 0aCatabolite repressor activator 0aEffector molecule 0aProtein crystallization 0aX-ray crystallography 0aSpontaneous cleavage 0aIsothermal titration calorimetry1 aKatiki, Madhusudhanarao1 aMahto, Jai Krishna1 aSharma, Monica1 aNarayanan, Anoop1 aMaity, Sudipa1 aTomar, Shailly1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1730-003X1 aAmbatipudi, Kiran1 aSharma, A.

Part two (the consumer and the regulator)  ap. 562-566.  aNew Zealand has a much higher rate of reported campylobacteriosis cases than the rest of the developed world. It has been assumed that New Zealanders have worse home hygiene practices during food preparation than the citizens of other developed countries. If this is the case then the study has to address how to educate New Zealanders more effectively about food hygiene practices.A QMRA study using the Bayesian approach has indicated that hygiene has a significant impact on the total probability of illness, as an increase in the poor hygiene percentage by approximately 50% reflected an increase of approximately 50% in the probability of illness. The findings of the QMRA and a review of consumer food handling practice in New Zealand and other developed countries confirm the hypothesis that poor hygiene may contribute to the high rate of campylobacteriosis in New Zealand. There is a lack of New Zealand data and studies regarding consumer knowledge and handling practices. The few studies that were conducted were not comprehensive. The poor hygiene practice of consumers could be linked to demographic, socioeconomic and psychological variables, as well as to personal receptivity to new information, previous knowledge and cultural influence. This study recommends using social marketing as a cost effective option for a future educational or communication strategy aimed at educating New Zealanders and improving their domestic food handling practices.Evidently, the priority for the scientific community, risk managers, policy makers and health professionals is not to celebrate the questionable (for the scientific community in New Zealand and abroad) rapid decline of campylobacteriosis cases but to accurately investigate further the rapid decline, and to think about how to further reduce the current rate as it is still the highest among the developed countries.  aPublisher supplied data 3acampylobacteriosis 3acost effectiveness 3adeveloped countries 3afood handling 3afood sanitation 3ahealth care workers 3ahygiene 3aissues and policy 3amarketing costs 3aprobability 3arisk managers 3asocial marketing 3aNew Zealand 0aConsumer practice 0aCampylobacteriosis 0aHome hygiene 0aRisk management 0aConsumer education0 tFood control.g2013 Oct., v. 33, no. 2 p.562-566dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl56242x0956-71357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodcont.2013.03.0503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02283naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001700152245008800169300001600257520125400273592002801527650003501555650002301590650002001613650002001633650001601653700001801669700002101687700002501708700002501733773010401758856008601862852000901948655001201957IND60087780820221121095718.0141102e201310  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008778082DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jviromet.2013.05.0172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVinken, Lore10aEvaluation of the automatic editing tool RECall for HIV-1 pol and V3 loop sequences  ap. 135-139.  aGenotypic drug resistance testing is routine practice in HIV-1 clinical care. The visual interpretation of sequencing electropherograms is labour-intensive and subject to intra- and inter-assay variability because decisions are based on operators’ judgments. In this study the performance of the automatic editing tool RECall was compared to the current standard of editing manually and editing using the tool ViroSeq. Using RECall a consensus sequence could be generated for 97% of the V3 loop and for 79% of the pol experiments. By comparison, using manual editing a consensus sequence could be reached for 87% of the V3 and 87% of the pol experiments. Using ViroSeq, a consensus sequence was generated for 68% of the pol experiments. On a predefined dataset, manual editing displayed the highest probability to accurately assign mixtures (0.91 vs. 0.88 by ViroSeq vs. 0.76 by RECall) and the lowest probability to inaccurately assign a mixture to a pure base call (0.002 vs. 0.019 by ViroSeq vs. 0.002 by RECall). As differences in base calling have little impact on drug resistance interpretation and hands-on-time could be substantially reduced, RECall could be a valuable tool for the standardization and acceleration of the editing process.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHuman immunodeficiency virus 1 3aconsensus sequence 3adata collection 3adrug resistance 3aprobability1 aMegens, Sarah1 aSchrooten, Yoeri1 aVandamme, Anne-Mieke1 aVan Laethem, Kristel0 tJournal of virological methods.g2013 Oct., v. 193, no. 1 p.135-139dElsevier B.V.x0166-09347nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jviromet.2013.05.0173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03113naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245012100163300001600284520158300300592002801883650001701911650001801928650001001946650001901956650001901975650002101994650001602015650001302031650002002044650001802064650001602082650000902098650001202107650003802119653002302157653005302180653001502233653002102248653003402269700001502303700001802318700001902336700001602355700001702371700001902388773009802407856008102505852000902586655001202595IND60606304120221121032135.0180725e20160115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060630412DNAL7 a10.1016/j.lfs.2015.12.0342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Lianpin10aOlmesartan ameliorates pressure overload-induced cardiac remodeling through inhibition of TAK1/p38 signaling in mice  ap. 121-126.  aMany studies have demonstrated the potent effects of ARB administration on heart failure. However, the mechanism of the potent effects of ARB on cardiac remodeling is less well understood. We investigated the role of Olmesartan on the fibrosis and hypertrophy in mouse heart.We employed TAC surgery, a mouse model of chronic cardiac failure. All the mice were separated into three groups: the sham group, TAC group and TAC plus Olmesartan group (given Olmesartan treatment after TAC). We analyzed left ventricle remodeling, and function by echocardiography or pathology. We further detected the level of marker genes involved in fibrosis and hypertrophy and in cultured neonatal rat cardiac fibroblasts and myocytes infected by constitutively active TAK1 and p38MAPK. After TAC, all the mice developed hypertrophy, worse cardiac function and malignant remodeling in left ventricle.Olmesartan improved heart remodeling and function without changing pressure of blood. Moreover, Olmesartan reduced the level of transforming growth factor β activated kinase-1 (TAK1) and phospho-p38MAPK. In neonatal rat cardiac fibroblast cells and cardiomyocytes, Olmesartan also decreased TAK1 and p38MAPK activation triggered by TGFβ1 or AngII. The inhibitory effect of Olmesartan was abrogated by overexpression of constitutively active TAK1 and p38MAPK by adenovirus system.Our results suggest Olmesartan improves heart remodeling and function induced by pressure overload. P38MAPK inactivation attenuated by olmesartan via inhibition of TAK1 pathway plays an important role in the process.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAdenoviridae 3aanimal models 3ablood 3acardiac output 3acardiomyocytes 3aechocardiography 3afibroblasts 3afibrosis 3agenetic markers 3aheart failure 3ahypertrophy 3amice 3asurgery 3atransforming growth factor beta 1 0aCardiac remodeling 0aTransforming growth factor β activated kinase-1 0aOlmesartan 0aCardiac fibrosis 0aTransverse aorta constriction1 aMei, Liqin1 aChong, Lynne,1 aHuang, Yinqing1 aLi, Yuechun1 aChu, Maoping1 aYang, Xiangjun0 tLife sciences.g2016 Jan. 15, v. 145 p.121-126dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11720x0024-32057nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lfs.2015.12.0343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01487naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100003200145245009900177300001600276520033200292592002800624650001300652650001000665650001100675650001000686650002000696650001200716651001600728653001500744653001800759653001400777653001700791653001600808653001000824653001000834700003400844773012100878856008100999852000901080655001201089IND60477692120221121052537.0160105s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6047769212DNAL7 a10.18475/cjos.v46i1.a132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRodríguez Durán, Armando,10aNew Records for the Bat Fauna of Mona Island, Puerto Rico, with Notes on their Natural History  ap. 102-105.  aWe conducted two surveys of Mona Island, off the western coast of Puerto Rico.

Here, we sought to define the functional crosstalk between the lipid signaling and chemokine signaling. We obtained evidence that the induction of some chemokines is regulated by group VIA calcium‐independent phospholipase A₂β (iPLA₂β) in IL‐1β‐stimulated rat fibroblastic 3Y1 cells. Treatment of 3Y1 cells with IL‐1β elicited an increased release of chemotactic factor(s) for monocytic THP‐1 cells into culture medium in a time‐dependent manner. Inhibitor studies revealed that an intracellular PLA₂ inhibitor, arachidonoyl trifluoromethyl ketone (AACOCF₃), but not the cyclooxygenase inhibitor indomethacin, attenuated the release of chemotactic factor(s). The chemotactic activity was inactivated by treatment with either heat or proteinase K, suggesting this chemotactic factor(s) is a proteinaceous factor(s). We purified the chemotactic factor(s) from the conditioned medium of IL‐1β‐stimulated 3Y1 cells using a heparin column and identified several chemokines, including CCL2 and CXCL10. The inducible expressions of CCL2 and CXCL10 were significantly attenuated by pretreatment with AACOCF₃. Gene silencing using siRNA revealed that the inductions of CCL2 and CXCL10 were attenuated by iPLA₂β knockdown. Additionally, the transcriptional activation of nuclear factor of activated T‐cell proteins (NFATs), but not nuclear factor‐κB, by IL‐1β stimulation was markedly attenuated by the iPLA₂ inhibitor bromoenol lactone, and NFATc4 knockdown markedly attenuated the IL‐1β‐induced expression of both CCL2 and CXCL10. Collectively, these results indicated that iPLA₂β plays roles in IL‐1β‐induced chemokine expression, in part via NFATc4 signaling.  aPublisher supplied data 3aT-lymphocytes 3acell movement 3achemoattractants 3achemokine CCL2 3achemokine CXCL10 3achemotaxis 3aculture media 3aenzyme inhibitors 3afibroblasts 3agene silencing 3aheat 3aheparin 3aimmune response 3aindomethacin 3ainterleukin-1beta 3alipids 3apeptidase K 3aphospholipase A2 3aphospholipases 3aprostaglandin synthase 3arats 3asmall interfering RNA 3atranscription factor NF-kappa B 3atranscriptional activation1 aYuzurihara, Chihiro1 aKinoshita, Natsumi1 aTaki, Yuki1 aIkegami, Yuki1 aWashio, Sana1 aHirakawa, Yushi1 aYoda, Emiko1 aAiuchi, Toshihiro1 aItabe, Hiroyuki1 aNakatani, Yoshihito1 aHara, Shuntaro0 tFEBS journal.g2018 June, v. 285, no. 11 p.2056-2070dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3943524x1742-464X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/febs.144623Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02345naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245013400165300001600299520092700315592002801242650000801270650002301278650002601301650001901327650001001346650002201356650001901378650002201397650001101419650001501430650001901445650000901464650002501473650002401498650003501522651001001557700001501567700001901582700001601601700001701617700001201634700001701646773011001663856008101773852000901854655001201863IND60585595520221120094244.0171111e201712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058559552DNAL7 a10.1007/s12686-017-0720-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMiao, Guidong10aIsolation and characterization of 91 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers for the blue swimming crab (Portunus pelagicus)  ap. 549-556.  aThe blue swimming crab (Portunus pelagicus) is one of most important crab fishery resources in China. In this study, we first isolated and characterized a set of 91 SNP loci in P. pelagicus. A total of 8426 bp long high quality DNA sequences were obtained, from which 91 SNP loci were identified and well genotyped. The average frequency of SNP loci was one locus every 93 base pairs in P. pelagicus genome. Of these 91 SNP loci, each had bi-alleles with the minor allele frequency ranging from 0.0167 to 0.5000. The observed heterozygosity per locus ranged from 0.0333 to 1.0000, while the expected heterozygosity per locus was from 0.0333 to 0.5085. Forty-four loci showed significant deviation from Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium. The SNP markers developed herein will be helpful for elucidating population genetic diversity, population dynamics, and conservation genetics of P. pelagicus and other related crab species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aPortunus pelagicus 3aconservation genetics 3acrab fisheries 3acrabs 3afishery resources 3agene frequency 3agenetic variation 3agenome 3agenotyping 3aheterozygosity 3aloci 3anucleotide sequences 3apopulation dynamics 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 3aChina1 aMa, Hongyu1 aYang, Xiaolong1 aWang, Shuqi1 aWu, Qingyang1 aShi, Xi1 aYou, Cuihong0 tConservation genetics resources.g2017 Dec., v. 9, no. 4 p.549-556dSpringer Netherlandsx1877-72527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12686-017-0720-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02916naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094024002200121024001900143024003000162040001800192100003400210245011800244300001600362500001100378506002800389506003000417520112300447592002801570596004401598596004501642596004701687596004101734596011101775596008701886506003701973650001202010650002202022650001402044650001402058650001402072700001802086700001902104700002802123700001702151700002102168773011702189856007302306903002202379852000902401655001202410IND60638233220221207072402.0190426e201906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063823322DNAL7 a10.1111/ele.132502doi7 aPMC71636712pmcid7 a308612892pmid7 a10.1111/ele.132502chorus  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFountain‐Jones, Nicholas M.10aEndemic infection can shape exposure to novel pathogens: Pathogen co‐occurrence networks in the Serengeti lions  ap. 904-913.  aLETTER  aResource is Open Access  aWiley License Information  aPathogens are embedded in a complex network of microparasites that can collectively or individually alter disease dynamics and outcomes. Endemic pathogens that infect an individual in the first years of life, for example, can either facilitate or compete with subsequent pathogens thereby exacerbating or ameliorating morbidity and mortality. Pathogen associations are ubiquitous but poorly understood, particularly in wild populations. We report here on 10 years of serological and molecular data in African lions, leveraging comprehensive demographic and behavioural data to test if endemic pathogens shape subsequent infection by epidemic pathogens. We combine network and community ecology approaches to assess broad network structure and characterise associations between pathogens across spatial and temporal scales. We found significant non‐random structure in the lion‐pathogen co‐occurrence network and identified both positive and negative associations between endemic and epidemic pathogens. Our results provide novel insights on the complex associations underlying pathogen co‐occurrence networks.  aPublisher supplied data  cNSFdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100000001  cUSDAdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100000199  aDEB‐1413925cNational Science Foundation  a1654609cNational Science Foundation  cUniversity of Minnesota’ Office of the Vice President for Research and Academic Health Center Seed Grant  aMIN‐62‐098cCooperative State Research Service, U.S. Department of Agriculture0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aFelidae 3acommunity ecology 3amorbidity 3amortality 3apathogens1 aPacker, Craig1 aJacquot, Maude1 aBlanchet, F. Guillaume1 aTerio, Karen1 aCraft, Meggan E.0 tEcology letters.g2019 June, v. 22, no. 6 p.904-913dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3774062x1461-023X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ele.132503Available from publisher's site  aVersion of Record  aDNAL 7aarticle02790naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001500140245012900155520167700284592002801961650001401989650001202003650001102015650001502026650002902041650001502070700001802085700002602103700001702129700001702146700001802163700001902181700001602200773012802216856007502344852000902419655001202428IND60766961720221117200856.0220211e20220120xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076696172DNAL7 a10.3390/rs140304742doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Yihao 10aLocal Enhancement of Marine Gravity Field over the Spratly Islands by Combining Satellite SAR Altimeter-Derived Gravity Data  aThe marine gravity field recovery close to land/island is challenging owing to the scarcity of measured gravimetric observations and sorely contaminated satellite radar altimeter-derived data. The satellite missions that carried the synthetic aperture radar (SAR) altimeters supplied data with improved quality compared to that retrieved from the conventional radar altimeters. In this study, we combine the satellite altimeter-derived gravity data for marine gravity field augmentation over island areas; in particular, the feasibility for regional augmentation by incorporating the SAR altimeter-derived gravity data is investigated. The gravity field modeling results over the Spratly Islands demonstrate that the marine gravity field is augmented by the incorporation of newly published satellite altimeter-derived gravity data. By merging the gravity models computed with the Sentinel-3A/B SAR altimetry data, the quasi-geoid and mean dynamic topography are dramatically improved, by a magnitude larger than 4 cm around areas close to islands, in comparison with the results directly derived from a combined global geopotential model alone. Further comparison of regional solutions computed from heterogeneous gravity models shows that the ones modeled from the SAR-based gravity models have better performances, the errors of which are reduced by a magnitude of 2~4 cm over the regions close to islands, in comparison with the solutions modeled with the gravity models developed without SAR altimetry data. These results highlight the superiority of using the SAR-based gravity data in marine gravity field recovery, especially over the regions close to land/island.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaltimetry 3agravity 3amodels 3asatellites 3asynthetic aperture radar 3atopography1 aWang, Junjie 1 aAbulaitijiang, Adili 1 aHe, Xiufeng 1 aLuo, Zhicai 1 aShi, Hongkai 1 aWang, Haihong 1 aDing, Yuan 0 tRemote Sensing.g2022 Jan. 20, v. 14, no. 3dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:26717x2072-42927nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs140304743Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02811naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001100139245019900150300001600349500002000365520142500385592002801810650002201838650001301860650002501873650001101898650000901909650001001918650001101928650001101939650001701950650001501967650001601982650001701998650002102015650001402036650001002050700001502060700001102075700001102086700001302097700001102110700001202121773011402133856007302247852000902320655001202329IND60572104920221118013333.0170712e201706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057210492DNAL7 a10.1111/rda.129192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSun, L10aMetabolomic profiling in umbilical venous plasma reveals effects of dietary rumen‐protected arginine or N‐carbamylglutamate supplementation in nutrient‐restricted Hu sheep during pregnancy  ap. 376-388.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aMaternal nutrient restriction during pregnancy is a major problem worldwide for human and animal production. Arginine (Arg) is critical to health, growth and reproduction. N‐carbamylglutamate (NCG), a key enzyme in arginine synthesis, is not extensively degraded in rumen. The aim of this study was to investigate ameliorating effects of rumen‐protected arginine (RP‐Arg) and NCG supplementation on dietary in undernourished Hu sheep during gestation. From day 35 to 110 of gestation, 32 Hu ewes carrying twin foetuses were randomly divided into four groups: a control (CG) group (n = 8; fed 100% National Research Council (NRC) requirements for pregnant sheep), a nutrient‐restricted (RG) group (n = 8; fed 50% NRC requirements, which included 50% mineral–vitamin mixture) and two treatment (Arg and NCG) groups (n = 8; fed 50% NRC requirements supplemented with 20 g/day RP‐Arg or 5 g/day NCG, which included 50% mineral–vitamin mixture). The umbilical venous plasma samples of foetus were tested by ¹H‐nuclear magnetic resonance. Thirty‐two differential metabolites were identified, indicating altered metabolic pathways of amino acid, carbohydrate and energy, lipids and oxidative stress metabolism among the four groups. Our results demonstrate that the beneficial effect of dietary RP‐Arg and NCG supplementation on mammalian reproduction is associated with complex metabolic networks.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal production 3aarginine 3abiochemical pathways 3aenergy 3aewes 3afetus 3ahumans 3alipids 3amalnutrition 3ametabolism 3ametabolites 3ametabolomics 3aoxidative stress 3apregnancy 3arumen1 aZhang, H.,1 aFan, Y1 aGuo, Y1 aZhang, G1 aNie, H1 aWang, F0 tReproduction in domestic animals.g2017 June, v. 52, no. 3 p.376-388dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx0936-67687nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/rda.129193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01516naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002100144245006000165506002800225520063400253592002800887506003700915650001600952650001000968650002300978650002101001773012801022856007901150852000901229655001201238IND60785570220221207130231.0190503s2007    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078557022DNAL7 a10.5281/zenodo.25654982doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRykhlivsky, I.P.10aGenesis views on the mechanism of plant acclimatization  aResource is Open Access  aIt has been found that mechanism of plant acclimatization from the point of view modern achievements in molecular genetics.

The selectivity of a qPCR primer set was investigated and different DNA extraction methods were compared. The limits of detection (LOD) of both detection methods were determined by serial inoculation of S. Typhimurium suspensions on cantaloupe surfaces. The repeatability of both detection methods was determined over three-day periods. Among 74 bacteria tested, only S. Typhimurium exhibited positive amplification, and other bacterial strains did not show any positive amplification. The DNeasy tissue kit showed the best performance for DNA purification due to the significantly superior threshold cycle (Ct) values, compared with either direct applications of qPCR without any extraction procedure or after employing a simple boiling method for extraction. The LOD and repeatability of qPCR and ME biosensor methods for S. Typhimurium detection were determined to be 1.35 ± 0.07 and 2.47 ± 0.50 log CFU/2 mm2 surface of cantaloupe, and 2.41 and 6.28%, respectively. The results demonstrate that the ME biosensor method is one of promising and practical on-site detection methods for S.

Yet, while most of the world's plant biodiversity can be found in the tropics, basic phytogeographical relationships and boundaries within this zone remain debated. We investigated whether palms, a species‐rich, well‐studied pantropical family, reflect traditional floristic schemes or support a recently published phylogenetic regionalisation that contests the traditional views on phytogeographical tropical regions. LOCATION: Tropics and subtropics. TAXON: Palm family (Arecaceae). METHODS: We use a species‐level dated phylogenetic tree of palms along with a dataset of all palm species distributions to calculate pairwise phylogenetic beta diversity among palm assemblages. From these pairwise dissimilarity values, we compute the relationship between assemblages in NMDS ordination space and use hierarchical clustering to define biogeographical units for palms. RESULTS: We found a Neotropical versus Palaeotropical division of palm assemblages as the major biogeographical split. Two Neotropical and four Palaeotropical clusters were identified with the following relationships: ((Southern Neotropical, Northern Neotropical), ((Indian Ocean), ((African), (Eurasian‐Australian, Melanesian‐Pacific)))). MAIN CONCLUSIONS: Our analysis supports many delineations suggested in traditional floristic schemes, most importantly a clear Neotropical versus Palaeotropical division and units resembling Takhtajan's African, Indo‐Malesian, New Caledonian and Polynesian Palaeotropical subkingdoms. However, as recently suggested in phylogenetic regionalisation, our results also show a clustering of Southeast Asian and Australian assemblages, substantiating the suggestion of a combined Asian‐Australian region. Biogeographical regionalisation for palms does not support the existence of trans‐continental dry tropical or subtropical phytogeographical clusters that have recently been found in dicot trees, despite known Northern Hemisphere connections for palms. Further modern regionalisations based on multiple datasets with complementary strengths are needed to establish a credible set of phytogeographical regions for the tropics.  aPublisher supplied data  cVILLUM FONDEN 3aArecaceae 3aMagnoliopsida 3aNeotropics 3adata collection 3ageographical distribution 3aphylogeny 3aphytogeography 3aspecies diversity 3aIndian Ocean1 aBaker, William J.1 aTietje, Melanie1 aEiserhardt, Wolf L.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8136-52330 tJournal of biogeography.g2021 Oct., v. 48, no. 10 p.2502-2511dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl9765x0305-02707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jbi.142163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03146naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100005700152245010400209300001600313520178800329592002802117650001502145650002302160650002002183650002202203650001102225650001702236650002102253650001902274650001102293650001502304650001602319653002102335653002002356653002902376653002102405653001702426700001402443700001902457700001602476773011202492856008702604852000902691655001202700IND60616107420221122060546.0181120e20181201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061610742DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apenergy.2018.09.1392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXiong, Yingqi1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2848-935710aVehicle grid integration for demand response with mixture user model and decentralized optimization  ap. 481-493.  aWith the rapidly growing electric vehicle adoption rate and increasing number of public electric vehicle charging stations in recent years, electric vehicle becomes more and more critical in the demand response programs. Development in Vehicle to Grid technology has converted electric vehicle to distributed energy resources. Using the Electric Vehicle Smart Charging Infrastructures on UCLA campus and city of Santa Monica as testbeds, we have collected real-world datasets of electric vehicle usage, based on which, we proposed optimal bi-directional charging control strategies to integrate electric vehicle in commercial and public parking facilities into the power grid as distributed energy resources for demand response programs by two-stage distributed optimization and water-filling algorithm. Driver behavioral uncertainties have been considered in our approach. Specifically, electric vehicle users are clustered by their behavioral patterns using a modified Latent Semantic Analysis. The first-stage optimization is performed to minimize energy cost using day-ahead wholesale energy price with predictions on energy demand and electric vehicle availability which generated by a mixture user model. Decentralized optimization (second-stage) is carried out on the next day in real-time to control individual electric vehicle so that the aggregated load can follow the first-stage optimal profile. As an alternative, a fast converging water filling algorithm is proposed and compared with two-stage optimization. Extensive simulation results show that proposed charging controls can utilize electric vehicle as distributed energy resource to accommodate demand response program while satisfying electric vehicle energy demands and providing significant energy cost savings.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3acost effectiveness 3adata collection 3aelectric vehicles 3aenergy 3aenergy costs 3aenergy resources 3ainfrastructure 3amodels 3aprediction 3auncertainty 0aElectric vehicle 0aDemand response 0aDistributed optimization 0aMachine learning 0aTopic mining1 aWang, Bin1 aChu, Chi-cheng1 aGadh, Rajit0 tApplied energy.g2018 Dec. 01, v. 231 p.481-493dElsevier LtdaElsevier LtdwJournal:11876x0306-26197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2018.09.1393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02413naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245010100159300002000260520131400280592002801594650002201622650001101644650001101655650002001666650001401686650002001700650001401720650001601734700001701750700001801767700001501785700001901800700001301819773012401832856007401956852000902030655001202039IND60618642520221120041718.0181030e20180718xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061864252DNAL7 a10.1039/c8ra04618b2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTan, Changlong14aThe crystallization kinetics of Co doping on Ni–Mn–Sn magnetic shape memory alloy thin films  ap. 25819-25828.  aCo doping is an effective means to improve the performance of Ni–Mn–Sn alloy bulks and thin films. However, the Co doping effect on the crystallization process of the Ni–Mn–Sn alloy thin films is important but not clear. Therefore, we investigate the influence of Co doping on the crystallization kinetics for Ni₅₀Mn₃₇₋ₓSn₁₃Coₓ (x = 0, 0.5, 1.5, 4) magnetic shape memory alloy thin films by DSC analysis. For the non-isothermal process, each DSC curve has a single exothermic peak, which is asymmetrical. The crystallization peak temperatures and the activation energy of thin films both rise gradually with increasing Co content. Then, the activation energy of Ni₅₀Mn₃₇₋ₓSn₁₃Coₓ (x = 0, 0.5, 1.5, 4) thin films obtained by the Kissinger equation method is determined as 157.9 kJ mol⁻¹, 198.8 kJ mol⁻¹, 213 kJ mol⁻¹ and 253.6 kJ mol⁻¹, respectively. The local activation energy of thin films with different Co content show the different variation tendency. In the isothermal crystallization, the average of the Avrami exponent n for thin films of each Co content is approximately 1.5, suggesting that the mechanism of crystallization is two-dimensional diffusion-controlled growth for Ni₅₀Mn₃₇₋ₓSn₁₃Coₓ (x = 0, 0.5, 1.5, 4) thin films.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactivation energy 3aalloys 3acobalt 3acrystallization 3aequations 3aheat production 3amagnetism 3atemperature1 aZhu, Jiachen1 aWang, Zhenhua1 aZhang, Kun1 aTian, Xiaohua,1 aCai, Wei0 tRSC advances.g2018 July 18, v. 8, no. 45 p.25819-25828dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c8ra04618b3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02013naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002900150245011200179300001600291520099500307592002801302650002101330650001101351650002401362650001101386650001501397650001501412651001401427700002201441700001901463700001901482773008101501856008401582852000901666655001201675IND60108109320221118151057.0141108e201302  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010810932DNAL7 a10.1016/j.renene.2012.06.0362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVladislavleva, Ekaterina10aPredicting the energy output of wind farms based on weather data: Important variables and their correlation  ap. 236-243.  aWind energy plays an increasing role in the supply of energy world wide. The energy output of a wind farm is highly dependent on the weather conditions present at its site. If the output can be predicted more accurately, energy suppliers can coordinate the collaborative production of different energy sources more efficiently to avoid costly overproduction. In this paper, we take a computer science perspective on energy prediction based on weather data and analyze the important parameters as well as their correlation on the energy output. To deal with the interaction of the different parameters, we use symbolic regression based on the genetic programming tool DataModeler. Our studies are carried out on publicly available weather and energy data for a wind farm in Australia. We report on the correlation of the different variables for the energy output. The model obtained for energy prediction gives a very reliable prediction of the energy output for newly supplied weather data.  aPublisher supplied data 3acomputer science 3aenergy 3ameteorological data 3amodels 3aprediction 3awind power 3aAustralia1 aFriedrich, Tobias1 aNeumann, Frank1 aWagner, Markus0 tRenewable energy.g2013 Feb., v. 50 p.236-243dElsevier Ltdx0960-14817nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.renene.2012.06.0363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02519naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004700094040001800141100001800159245014100177300001600318520137200334592002801706650001301734650002101747650001401768650003301782650001001815650002101825650002401846650002201870700001401892700001301906700001401919700001801933773010401951856009302055852000902148655001202157IND60105840720221122045725.0141108e201105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010584072DNAL7 a10.1016/j.polymdegradstab.2011.01.0342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJiang, Yunyun10aEffect of polyphenylsilsesquioxane on the ablative and flame-retardation properties of ethylene propylene diene monomer (EPDM) composite  ap. 949-954.  aPolyphenylsilsesquioxane (PPSQ) microspheres with ladder structure synthesized in the laboratory have been incorporated into ethylene propylene diene monomer (EPDM) composite in order to study the effect of PPSQ on the ablative and flame-retardation properties of EPDM composites. The results showed that PPSQ microspheres serve as an effective ablative additive and flame retardant for EPDM composites. Thus, PPSQ greatly improved the ablative properties of EPDM composites, with a 4.8 wt% loading leading to a remarkable reduction in the linear ablation rate of EPDM by about 50%. Moreover, this loading of PPSQ improved the flame retardancy and smoke suppression, and significantly reduced the PHRR of EPDM composite from 504 kW/m² to 278 kW/m². Moderate tensile strength could be obtained and the breaking elongation was improved for the EPDM/PPSQ composites. TGA results showed that PPSQ had little influence on the thermal decomposition of EPDM. SEM, CONE, and TG-FTIR tests showed that the char structure of EPDM composites was the primary factor through which PPSQ affected the ablative and flame-retardation properties of EPDM. The chars formed during the ablation of EPDM composites containing PPSQ had better structural stability and thermal stability, owing to the fact that they were denser, remained intact, and had an ordered arrangement of holes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aethylene 3aflame retardants 3apropylene 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asmoke 3atensile strength 3athermal degradation 3athermal stability1 aZhang, Xu1 aHe, Jiyu1 aYu, Liang1 aYang, Rongjie0 tPolymer degradation and stability.g2011 May, v. 96, no. 5 p.949-954dElsevier Ltdx0141-39107nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.polymdegradstab.2011.01.0343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03334naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001600152245024100168300001600409520197900425592002802404650001302432650001602445650001502461650001402476650001602490650001702506650001902523650001202542650002702554650002002581650001402601650003702615700001802652700002902670700002602699700002302725773008102748856008602829852000902915655001202924IND60105443720221121055939.0141108e201204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010544372DNAL7 a10.1016/j.peptides.2012.02.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGera, Lajos10aN-terminal extended conjugates of the agonists and antagonists of both bradykinin receptor subtypes: Structure–activity relationship, cell imaging using ligands conjugated with fluorophores and prospect for functionally active cargoes  ap. 433-446.  aPeptide agonists and antagonists of both bradykinin (BK) B₁ and B₂ receptors (B₁R, B₂R) are known to tolerate to a certain level N-terminal sequence extensions. Using this strategy, we produced and characterized the full set of fluorescent ligands by extending both agonists and antagonist peptides at both receptor subtypes with 5(6)-carboxyfluorescein (CF) and the ɛ-aminocaproyl (ɛ-ACA) optional spacer. Alternatively, kinin receptor ligands were extended with another carboxylic acid cargo (chlorambucil, biotinyl, pentafluorocinnamoyl, AlexaFluor-350 (AF350), ferrocenoyl, cetirizine) or with fluorescein isothiocyanate. N-terminal extension always reduced receptor affinity, more importantly for bulkier substituents and more so for the agonist version compared to the antagonist. This loss was generally alleviated by the presence of the spacer and modulated by the species of origin for the receptor. We report and review the pharmacological properties of these N-terminally extended peptides and the use of fluorophore-conjugated ligands in imaging of cell receptors and of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) in intact cells. Antagonists (B₁R: B-10376: CF-ɛ-ACA-Lys-Lys-[Hyp³, CpG⁵, d-Tic⁷, CpG⁸]des-Arg⁹-BK; B₂R: B-10380: CF-ɛ-ACA-d-Arg-[Hyp³, Igl⁵, d-Igl⁷, Oic⁸]-BK and fluorescein-5-thiocarbamoyl (FTC)-B-9430) label the plasma membrane of cells expressing the cognate receptors. The B₂R agonists CF-ɛ-ACA-BK, AF350-ɛ-ACA-BK and FTC-B-9972 are found in endosomes and model the endosomal degradation of BK in a complementary manner. The uneven surface fluorescence associated to the B₁R agonist B-10378 (CF-ɛ-ACA-Lys-des-Arg⁹-BK) is compatible with a particular form of agonist-induced receptor translocation. CF-ɛ-ACA-BK binds to the carboxydipeptidase ACE with an affinity identical to that of BK. Metal- or drug-containing cargoes further show the prospect of ligands that confer special signaling to kinin receptors.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagonists 3aantagonists 3abradykinin 3aendosomes 3afluorescein 3afluorescence 3aimage analysis 3aligands 3apeptidyl-dipeptidase A 3aplasma membrane 3areceptors 3astructure-activity relationships1 aRoy, Caroline1 aBawolak, Marie-Thérèse1 aCharest-Morin, Xavier1 aMarceau, François0 tPeptides.g2012 Apr., v. 34, no. 2 p.433-446dElsevier Inc.x0196-97817nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.peptides.2012.02.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02273naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001600148245010500164300001800269520121200287592002801499650001301527650001401540650001601554650001001570650000901580650002401589650001601613650002101629700002201650700002801672700001801700773007901718856008201797990002301879852000901902655001201911IND60102676120221120084033.0141106e201111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010267612DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fuel.2011.06.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNave, Ophir10aNumerical simulations applying to the analysis of thermal explosion of organic gel fuel in a hot gas  ap. 3410-3416.  aIn this work we investigate theoretically and numerically the nature of the evolution of a hot gas mixture containing organic gel fuel droplets of different radii with oscillatory evaporation within the context of thermal explosion theory. The polydisperse spray is modeled using a probability density function (PDF). In this paper we take into account the time evolution of the size distribution due to the evaporation process by using the kinetic equation. This new model is in the form of singular perturbed system (SPS) of highly nonlinear of ordinary differential equations. This SPS form of the model and the non-dimensionalization of the equations enable us first to apply the methods of integral manifolds (MIM) and second to identify the parameters that play a major role in determining the dynamical regimes of the considered system. Our analytical and numerical simulations results that based on the MIM show that the dynamical behavior is different than that found with the conventional liquid droplets. An explicit expression of the critical condition for thermal explosion limit is derived analytically and represents a generalization of the critical parameter of the classical Semenov theory.  aPublisher supplied data 3adroplets 3aequations 3aevaporation 3afuels 3agels 3amathematical models 3aprobability 3athermal analysis1 aBykov, Vitcheslav1 aGol’dshtein, Vladimir1 aLehavi, Yaron0 tFuel.g2011 Nov., v. 90, no. 11 p.3410-3416dElsevier Ltdx0016-23617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fuel.2011.06.0043Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02281naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245011800166300001600284520125100300592002801551650001501579650002501594650001301619650001401632650002101646650001501667650001601682650002201698650001401720700001601734773010301750856008101853852000901934655001201943IND60110241820221118061151.0141109e20120110xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011024182DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tca.2011.10.0302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKermanpour, F.10aThermodynamic study of binary mixture of x₁[C₆mim][BF₄]+x₂1-propanol: Measurements and molecular modeling  ap. 211-218.  aDensities, ρ, and viscosities, η, of pure 1-hexyl-3-methylimidazoliumtetrafluoro borate ([C₆mim][BF₄]) and 1-propanol, and their binary mixture {x₁[C₆mim][BF₄]+x₂1-propanol} were measured at atmospheric pressure and in the temperature range of 293.15–333.15K.

The excess molar volumes of the binary mixture are negative over the entire mole fraction range and increase with increasing temperature. Excess viscosities are negative over the entire mole fraction range of the mixture and decrease with increasing temperature.

Critical parameters including Ni thickness, cooling rate, and polycrystalline crystallographic orientation have been explored to understand the graphene formation mechanism and to obtain controlled carbon growth. We have studied the effect of operating conditions such as the synthesis time and feed composition, as well as the key role played by H₂. The effect of the foil position in the reactor with respect to the feed flow was reported: the back Ni surface, not exposed to the feed flow, shows an increased carbon deposition with respect to the front one. An increase of the segregation and precipitation phenomena, as a function of the cooling rate and under Ni thickness increase was observed. By decreasing the synthesis time, it is possible to obtain 1L on areas showing an increased Ni(111) diffraction peak intensity. By varying the hydrogen concentration it is possible to control the final graphene formation on the nickel surface, obtaining quite uniform 2–3-layer graphene.  aPublisher supplied data 3acatalytic activity 3acooling 3afeed composition 3afoil 3agraphene 3ahydrogen 3anickel 3avapors1 aCirillo, C.1 aPiscitelli, R.1 aCiambelli, P.0 tJournal of Molecular Catalysis.

Consumer products contain reactive chemicals which can form secondary pollutants which may contribute to these effects. The reaction of limonene and ozone is a well characterized example of this type of indoor air chemistry. The studies described here characterize an in vitro model using an epithelial cell line (A549) or differentiated epithelial tissue (MucilAir™). The model is used to investigate adverse effects following exposure to combinations of limonene and ozone. In A549 cells, exposure to both the parent compounds and reaction products resulted in alterations in inflammatory cytokine production. A one hour exposure to limonene+ozone resulted in decreased proliferation when compared to cells exposed to limonene alone. Repeated dose exposures of limonene or limonene+ozone were conducted on MucilAir™ tissue. No change in proliferation was observed but increases in cytokine production were observed for both the parent compounds and reaction products. Factors such as exposure duration, chemical concentration, and sampling time point were identified to influence result outcome. These findings suggest that exposure to reaction products may produce more severe effects compared to the parent compound.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadverse effects 3aair 3achemical concentration 3acytokines 3aepidemiological studies 3aepithelial cells 3aexposure duration 3amodels 3aozone 3apollutants1 aKhurshid, Shahana S.1 aMeade, B.

Separation of the metals has been carried out on the basis of their different boiling points, being 357°C and 906°C the boiling point of mercury and zinc and 1564°C the melting point of Mn₂O₃. Characterization by chemical analysis, TGA/DTA and X-ray powder diffraction of the mixture has been carried out after comminution sieving and shaking table treatment to remove the anodic collectors and most of chlorides contained in the mixture. The mixture has been roasted at various temperatures and resident times in a flow of air to set the best conditions to remove mercury that were 400°C and 10min. After that, the flow of air has been turned into a nitrogen one (inert atmosphere) and the temperatures raised, thus permitting the zinc oxide to be reduced to metallic zinc by the carbon present in the original mixture and recovered after volatilization as a high grade concentrate, while manganese was left in the residue. The recovery and the grade of the two metals, at 1000°C and 30min residence time, were 84% and 100% for zinc and 85% and 63% for manganese, respectively. The recovery of zinc increased to 99% with a grade of 97% at 1200°C and 30min residence time, while the recovery and grade of manganese were 86% and 87%, respectively, at that temperature. Moreover, the chlorinated compounds that could form by the combustion of the plastics contained in the spent batteries, are destroyed at the temperature required by the process.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3aair flow 3abatteries 3aboiling 3aboiling point 3acarbon 3achemical analysis 3achlorides 3acollectors 3acombustion 3amanganese 3amelting point 3amercury 3anitrogen 3aplastics 3asieving 3atemperature 3avolatilization 3awaste management 3azinc 3azinc oxide1 aLavecchia, R.1 aMedici, F.1 aPiga, L.0 tWaste management.g2012 Oct., v. 32, no. 10 p.1945-1951dElsevier Ltdx0956-053X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2012.05.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04014naa a2200757 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094024002200130024001900152040001800171100002500189245007800214300002000292520178700312592002802099650002202127650000802149650001402157650000802171650001302179650001102192650001102203650001302214650001002227650002202237650001502259650001302274650001502287650002002302650003502322700002002357700002002377700002202397700002202419700002202441700002402463700002202487700001902509700002902528700002202557700002002579700002702599700002002626700002802646700002302674700001902697700003102716700002002747700002002767700003202787700003102819700001602850700002502866700002102891700002502912700002502937700002302962700002302985773012203008856008203130990002303212852000903235655001203244IND60100165720221120144228.0141105e201110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010016572DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jaci.2011.04.0582doi7 aPMC31851082pmcid7 a216968132pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchauberger, Eric M.10aIdentification of ATPAF1 as a novel candidate gene for asthma in children  ap. 753-760.e11.  aBACKGROUND: Asthma is a common disease of children with a complex genetic origin. Understanding the genetic basis of asthma susceptibility will allow disease prediction and risk stratification. OBJECTIVE: We sought to identify asthma susceptibility genes in children. METHODS: A nested case-control genetic association study of children of Caucasian European ancestry from a birth cohort was conducted. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs, n = 116,024) were genotyped in pools of DNA samples from cohort children with physician-diagnosed asthma (n = 112) and normal controls (n = 165). A genomic region containing the ATPAF1 gene was found to be significantly associated with asthma. Additional SNPs within this region were genotyped in individual samples from the same children and in 8 independent study populations of Caucasian, African American, Hispanic, or other ancestries. SNPs were also genotyped or imputed in 2 consortia control populations. ATPAF1 expression was measured in bronchial biopsies from asthmatic patients and controls. RESULTS: Asthma was found to be associated with a cluster of SNPs and SNP haplotypes containing the ATPAF1 gene, with 2 SNPs achieving significance at a genome-wide level (P = 2.26 × 10⁻⁵ to 2.2 × 10⁻⁸). Asthma severity was also found to be associated with SNPs and SNP haplotypes in the primary population. SNP and/or gene-level associations were confirmed in the 4 non-Hispanic populations. Haplotype associations were also confirmed in the non-Hispanic populations (P = .045-.0009). ATPAF1 total RNA expression was significantly (P < .01) higher in bronchial biopsies from asthmatic patients than from controls. CONCLUSION: Genetic variation in the ATPAF1 gene predisposes children of different ancestries to asthma.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAfrican Americans 3aDNA 3aHispanics 3aRNA 3aancestry 3aasthma 3abiopsy 3achildren 3agenes 3agenetic variation 3ahaplotypes 3apatients 3aprediction 3arisk assessment 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism1 aEwart, Susan L.1 aArshad, Syed H.1 aHuebner, Marianne1 aKarmaus, Wilfried1 aHolloway, John W.1 aFriderici, Karen H.1 aZiegler, Julie T.1 aZhang, Hongmei1 aRose-Zerilli, Matthew J.1 aBarton, Sheila J.1 aHolgate, S.

TAT-Superoxide dismutase (TAT-SOD) can be transduced across the cell membrane to scavenge superoxide. This protein's unique properties make it a promising therapeutic candidate to attenuate cerebral damage. In this study, we sought further the understanding of the fusion protein's cerebral protective effects and the mechanism which is exerted in these effects. MAIN METHODS: Male Sprague Dawley rats (n=100, 230±20g) were divided randomly into five experimental groups: a sham group, a cerebral Ischemia/Reperfusion (I/R) group treated with saline (20ml/Kg, i.p.), and three cerebral I/R groups treated with TAT-SOD (25KU/ml/Kg, i.p.) at either 2h before I/R, 2h after I/R or 4h after I/R. Cerebral I/R injury was facilitated by inducing ischemia for two hours followed by 24h reperfusion. The levels of SOD, Malondialdehyde (MDA), and ATPase in cerebral tissues were determined. The apoptotic indexes were evaluated, and apoptosis genes were analyzed immunohistochemically. KEY FINDINGS: TAT-SOD treatment significantly increased cerebral SOD and ATPase activities, decreased MDA content, and remarkably reduced apoptosis indexes. TAT-SOD treatments 2h before or after I/R significantly reduced caspase-3 and bax proteins and boosted bcl-2 protein, while the treatment at 4h after I/R showed no influence on the three proteins. SIGNIFICANCE: TAT-SOD treatment effectively enhanced cerebral antioxidant ability, reduced lipid peroxidation, preserved mitochondrial ATPase and thus inhibited nerve cell apoptosis. The effective treatment window extended from 2h before to 2h after I/R.  aPublisher supplied data 3aH-transporting ATP synthase 3aadenosinetriphosphatase 3aantioxidant activity 3aapoptosis 3abrain 3acaspase-3 3acell membranes 3agenes 3aimmunohistochemistry 3aintraperitoneal injection 3aischemia 3alipid peroxidation 3amalondialdehyde 3aneurons 3aprotective effect 3aproteins 3arats 3asuperoxide anion 3asuperoxide dismutase1 aLiu, Shutao1 aLin, Yanyun1 aRao, Pingfan0 tLife sciences.g2011 Dec. 5, v. 89, no. 23-24 p.868-874dElsevier Inc.x0024-32057nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lfs.2011.09.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03055naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001500151245010400166300001600270520148600286592002801772650001501800650001501815650001101830650001101841650001101852650001101863650003101874650002401905650002501929650001901954650000901973650001401982650001401996650001102010650001802021650000702039650002702046650002302073650001402096650001602110650001902126650001202145650000902157700001502166700001702181700001702198700001302215700001602228700001802244700001702262773010402279856008502383852000902468655001202477IND60101483920221120052841.0141106e20120830xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010148392DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhazmat.2012.06.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Hang10aSelective solid-phase extraction of uranium by salicylideneimine-functionalized hydrothermal carbon  ap. 321-330.  aA new salicylideneimine-functionalized hydrothermal-carbon-based solid-phase extractant was developed for the purpose of separating uranium selectively for sustainability of uranium resources. The resulting adsorption material was obtained via hydrothermal carbonization, calcination at mild temperature (573.15K), amination, and grafting with salicylaldehyde in sequence. Both Fourier transform infrared spectra and elemental analysis proved the successful grafting of salicylideneimine onto hydrothermal carbon matrix. Adsorption behaviors of the extractant on uranium(VI) were investigated by varying pH values of solution, adsorbent amounts, contact times, initial metal concentrations, temperatures, and ionic strengths. An optimum adsorption capacity of 1.10mmolg⁻¹ (261mgg⁻¹) for uranium(VI) was obtained at pH 4.3. The present adsorption process obeyed pseudo-second-order model and Langmuir isotherm. Thermodynamic parameters (ΔH=+8.81kJmol⁻¹, ΔS=+110JK⁻¹mol⁻¹, ΔG=−23.0kJmol⁻¹) indicated the adsorption process was endothermic and spontaneous. Results from batch adsorption test in simulated nuclear industrial effluent, containing Cs⁺, Sr²⁺, Ba²⁺, Mn²⁺, Co²⁺, Ni²⁺, Zn²⁺, La³⁺, Ce³⁺, Nd³⁺, Sm³⁺, and Gd³⁺, showed the adsorbent could separate uranium(VI) from those competitive ions with high selectivity. The adsorbent might be promising for use in certain key steps in any future sustainable nuclear fuel cycle.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3abarium 3acarbon 3acesium 3acobalt 3ahydrothermal carbonization 3ahydroxybenzaldehyde 3aindustrial effluents 3aionic strength 3aions 3alanthanum 3amanganese 3anickel 3anuclear fuels 3apH 3asolid phase extraction 3asorption isotherms 3astrontium 3atemperature 3athermodynamics 3auranium 3azinc1 aMa, Lijian1 aCao, Kecheng1 aGeng, Junxia1 aLiu, Jun1 aSong, Qiang1 aYang, Xiaodan1 aLi, Shoujian0 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2012 Aug. 30, v. 229-230 p.321-330dElsevier B.V.x0304-38947nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2012.06.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02722naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001600148245006800164300001600232520147400248592002801722650001901750650001501769650003101784650001201815650001801827650001701845650001301862650002501875650002001900650001101920650003101931650001501962700001801977700001601995700002602011700001702037700001702054773010302071856008202174990002302256852000902279655001202288IND60108040820221119180035.0141108e201308  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010804082DNAL7 a10.1016/j.rser.2013.03.0462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMasum, B.M.10aEffect of ethanol–gasoline blend on NOx emission in SI engine  ap. 209-222.  aThe stricter worldwide emission legislation and growing demands for lower fuel consumption and anthropogenic CO₂ emission require significant efforts to improve combustion efficiency while satisfying the emission quality demands. Ethanol fuel combined with gasoline provides a particularly promising and, at the same time, a challenging approach. Ethanol is widely used as an alternative fuel or an effective additive of gasoline due to the advantage of its high octane number and its self-sustaining concept, which can be supplied regardless of the fossil fuel. As a result, vast study has been carried out to study its effects on engine performance and emission. The first part of this article discusses prospect of fuel ethanol as a gasoline substitute. Then it discusses comparative physicochemical properties of ethanol and gasoline. The slight differences in properties between ethanol and gasoline fuels are enough to create considerable change to combustion system as well as behaviors of SI engines. These effects lead to several complex and interacting mechanisms, which make it difficult to identify the fundamentals of how ethanol affects NOx emission. After that, general NOx forming mechanisms are discussed to create a fundamental basis for further discussion. Finally, the article discusses different fuel composition, engine parameter and engine modification effects on NOx formation as well as mathematical approach for NOx prediction using ethanol.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon dioxide 3acombustion 3aenergy use and consumption 3aethanol 3aethanol fuels 3afossil fuels 3agasoline 3alaws and regulations 3anitrogen oxides 3aoctane 3aphysicochemical properties 3aprediction1 aMasjuki, H.H.1 aKalam, M.A.1 aRizwanul Fattah, I.M.1 aPalash, S.M.1 aAbedin, M.J.0 tRenewable & sustainable energy reviews.g2013 Aug., v. 24 p.209-222dElsevier Ltdx1364-03217nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rser.2013.03.0463Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02411naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002900152245013100181300001600312520095600328592002801284650001501312650002501327650001601352650002901368650002701397650001901424650002201443650001401465650003701479650002201516650002201538650003701560650001401597650001101611700003501622700003401657700001901691700002501710700002301735700001901758773008101777856008601858852000901944655001201953IND60105443820221121055826.0141108e201204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010544382DNAL7 a10.1016/j.peptides.2012.02.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRamírez-Carreto, Santos10aGene cloning and functional characterization of four novel antimicrobial-like peptides from scorpions of the family Vaejovidae  ap. 290-295.  aFrom the cDNA libraries made from the venom glands of two scorpions belonging to the Vaejovidae family, four different putative non disulfide-bridged antimicrobial peptides were identified: VmCT1 and VmCT2 from Vaejovis mexicanus smithi plus VsCT1 and VsCT2 from Vaejovis subcristatus. These short peptides (with only 13 amino acid residues each) share important amino acid sequence similarities among themselves and with other reported antimicrobial peptides, but their biological activities vary dramatically. This communication reports the cloning, chemical synthesis and characterization of these peptides. Two peptides, VmCT1 and VmCT2 showed broad-spectrum antibacterial activity with minimum inhibitory concentrations MICs in the range of 5–25μM and 10–20μM respectively, whereas their hemolytic activity at these concentrations was low. Structure–function relationships that might determine the differences in activities are discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aScorpiones 3aamino acid sequences 3aamino acids 3aantibacterial properties 3aantimicrobial peptides 3acDNA libraries 3acomplementary DNA 3ahemolysis 3aminimum inhibitory concentration 3amolecular cloning 3asequence homology 3astructure-activity relationships 3asynthesis 3avenoms1 aQuintero-Hernández, Verónica1 aJiménez-Vargas, Juana María1 aCorzo, Gerardo1 aPossani, Lourival D.1 aBecerril, Baltazar1 aOrtiz, Ernesto0 tPeptides.g2012 Apr., v. 34, no. 2 p.290-295dElsevier Inc.x0196-97817nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.peptides.2012.02.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03282naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245010300165300001400268520181500282592002802097650002402125650001802149650001502167650001402182650001502196650001602211650001902227650001402246650001102260650002102271650001702292650002102309650002102330650001502351650001502366653000802381653002302389653001902412653002102431653002202452700001802474700001702492700002102509700002202530700002202552773010002574856008102674852000902755655001202764IND60101707920221119041705.0161016e20130628xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010170792DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jim.2013.03.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aClark, Darcey10aBiomarkers for non-human primate Type-I hypersensitivity: Antigen-specific immunoglobulin E assays  ap. 29-37.  aImmunoglobulin E (IgE) is the least abundant immunoglobulin in serum. However, development of an IgE immune response can induce IgE receptor-expressing cells to carry out potent effector functions. A reliable antigen-specific IgE biomarker method for use in non-human primate studies would facilitate (i) confirmation of Type-I hypersensitivity reactions during safety toxicology testing, and (ii) a better understanding of non-human primate models of allergic disease. We cloned and expressed a recombinant cynomolgus monkey IgE molecule in order to screen a panel of commercially available detection reagents raised against human IgE for cross-reactivity. The reagent most reactive to cynomolgus IgE was confirmed to be specific for IgE and did not bind recombinant cynomolgus monkey IgG1-4. A drug-specific IgE assay was developed on the MSD electrochemiluminescent (ECL) platform. The assay is capable of detecting 10ng/mL drug-specific IgE. Importantly, the assay is able to detect IgE in the presence of excess IgG, the scenario likely to be present in a safety toxicology study. Using our ECL assay, we were able to confirm that serum from cynomolgus monkeys that had experienced clinical symptoms consistent with hypersensitivity responses contained IgE specific for a candidate therapeutic antibody. In addition, a bioassay for mast cell activation was developed using CD34+-derived cynomolgus monkey mast cells. This assay confirmed that plasma from animals identified as positive in the drug-specific IgE immunoassay contained biologically active IgE (i.e. could sensitize cultured mast cells), resulting in histamine release after exposure to the therapeutic antibody. These sensitive assays for Type-I hypersensitivity in the NHP can confirm that secondary events are downstream of immunogenicity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMacaca fascicularis 3aanimal models 3aantibodies 3abioassays 3abiomarkers 3ablood serum 3across reaction 3ahistamine 3ahumans 3ahypersensitivity 3aimmunoassays 3aimmunoglobulin E 3aimmunoglobulin G 3amast cells 3atoxicology 0aIgE 0aAnti-drug antibody 0aImmunogenicity 0aHypersensitivity 0aNon-human primate1 aShiota, Faith1 aForte, Carla1 aNarayanan, Padma1 aMytych, Daniel T.1 aHock, M.

Membrane proteins perform many essential functions, which include operating as transporters, adhesion-anchors, receptors, and enzymes. Recent advancements in proteomic mass spectrometry have resulted in substantial progress towards the determination of the plasma membrane (PM) proteome, resolution of membrane protein topology, establishment of numerous receptor protein complexes, identification of ligand–receptor pairs, and the elucidation of signaling networks originating at the PM.

Progress in TB research has been slow, and remains burdened by important gaps in our knowledge of the basic biology of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the causative agent of TB, and its interaction with the human host. Fortunately, major systems biology initiatives have recently been launched that will help fill some of these gaps. However, to fully comprehend TB and control this disease globally, current systems biological approaches will not suffice. The influence of host and pathogen diversity, changes in human demography, and socioeconomic and environmental factors will also need to be considered. Such a multidisciplinary approach might be best described as ‘systems epidemiology’ in an effort to overcome the traditional boundaries between basic biology and classical epidemiology.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aMycobacterium tuberculosis 3ademography 3adisease control 3aenvironmental factors 3aepidemiology 3ahumans 3apathogens 3apeople 3atuberculosis1 aGagneux, Sebastien0 tTrends in microbiology.g2011 Oct., v. 19, no. 10 p.492-500dElsevier Ltdx0966-842X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tim.2011.07.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01960naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245016100167300001600328520072100344592002801065650001401093650002301107650001101130650001301141650002401154650001801178650002201196650002401218650001001242700001301252700001901265700001501284700001701299700001901316773011001335856008501445990002301530852000901553655001201562IND60102259520221119223531.0141106e201301  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010225952DNAL7 a10.1016/j.molcata.2012.10.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Ruixia10aReduction of citral in water under typical transfer hydrogenation conditions—Reaction mechanisms with evolution of and hydrogenation by molecular hydrogen  ap. 315-320.  aThe reduction of an α,β-unsaturated aldehyde, citral, was investigated over a 10wt% Pd catalyst under transfer hydrogenation (TH) conditions in a closed system with microwave assistance.

The resulting temperature–time profiles indicate that the studied polymers decompose through phase boundary, random scission, diffusion and nucleation mechanisms respectively. The results here presented demonstrate that the strong dependence of the temperature–time profile on the reaction mechanism would allow the real kinetic model obeyed by a reaction to be discerned from a single CRTA curve.  aPublisher supplied data 3amodels 3apoly(vinyl chloride) 3apolyethylene 3apolytetrafluoroethylene 3athermal analysis 3athermal degradation 3athermal stability 3avinyl chloride1 aPérez-Maqueda, Luis A.1 aPerejón, Antonio,1 aCriado, José M.0 tPolymer degradation and stability.g2011 May, v. 96, no. 5 p.974-981dElsevier Ltdx0141-39107nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.polymdegradstab.2011.01.0273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02029naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002900148245007600177300001800253520087200271592002801143650002901171650001301200650001101213650000901224650002401233650001301257650001701270650000901287650002401296650001601320650001101336700002101347700001801368700002001386700002001406773007901426856008201505990002301587852000901610655001201619IND60102676320221120084011.0141106e201111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010267632DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fuel.2011.06.0522doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHammerschmidt, Alexander10aConversion of yeast by hydrothermal treatment under reducing conditions  ap. 3424-3432.  aIn the work reported here, baker’s yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) was used as feed for the production of liquid biofuels in a continuous one-step process under hydrothermal conditions in the presence of excess hydrogen and K₂CO₃. The yeast conversion experiments were performed in an up-flow reactor under near-critical water conditions (T 330–450°C, p 20–32MPa). The products consisted of three phases, an oil-like organic phase, a gaseous phase, and an aqueous phase. Higher concentrations of organic carbon in the process resulted in a higher product yield. The heating value of the organic phase was up to 38.6MJ/kg. Liquefaction of yeast without any addition of K₂CO₃ also resulted in liquid oil, but the quality and the yield of the oil product were lower. A reaction temperature of 400°C was found to be optimal for the oil yield and quality.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3abiofuels 3acarbon 3aheat 3ahot water treatment 3ahydrogen 3aliquefaction 3aoils 3apotassium carbonate 3atemperature 3ayeasts1 aBoukis, Nikolaos1 aGalla, Ulrich1 aDinjus, Eckhard1 aHitzmann, Bernd0 tFuel.g2011 Nov., v. 90, no. 11 p.3424-3432dElsevier Ltdx0016-23617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fuel.2011.06.0523Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03065naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245011000168300001600278520165400294592002801948650001101976650001101987650001001998650001402008650002502022650002702047650002002074650001002094650001702104650002502121650001502146650001902161650002402180650001702204650001902221650001302240650001002253700002102263700002302284700002202307700002202329773011802351856008202469990002302551852000902574655001202583IND60100165820221121042803.0141105e201110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010016582DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jaci.2011.06.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOmland, Øyvind10aNew-onset asthma and the effect of environment and occupation among farming and nonfarming rural subjects  ap. 761-765.  aBACKGROUND: Many factors, including environmental exposures, have been related to the increase in the prevalence of asthma, but only few have been tested for in longitudinal studies. OBJECTIVE: We studied farming students to determine whether their environment during childhood and as adults was a factor determining subsequent onset of asthma. METHODS: From 1994 to 1998, new cases of asthma were identified by means of an annual posted questionnaire followed by a telephone interview in a prospective cohort consisting of 1964 farming-school students and 407 nonfarming subjects aged 16 to 26 years. For each case, we selected a control subject from the cohort with no asthma in a case-based design, and all underwent an interview and a clinical examination. RESULTS: We found 122 new cases of asthma. In a multiple regression model the odds ratio for new asthma was 3.3 (95% CI, 1.7-6.3) for smoking; 3.4 (95% CI, 1.6-7.0), 2.5 (95% CI, 1.1-5.3), and 7.0 (95% CI, 1.2-41.6) for exposure to swine, dairy production, and welding, respectively; and 11.7 (95% CI, 2.4-56.4) for bronchial hyperresponsiveness at baseline. Being born and raised on a farm significantly reduced the risk odds ratio (0.5 [95% CI, 0.3-0.98]), whereas atopy had no influence. CONCLUSION: Exposure to swine and dairy confinements, welding, smoking, and bronchial hyperresponsiveness are risk factors for nonallergic asthma, and being born and raised on a farm reduces the subsequent risk. These findings support the theory that immune and inflammatory responses can be influenced by environmental exposure to early childhood, reducing the risk of asthma later in life.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadults 3aasthma 3aatopy 3achildhood 3aclinical examination 3aenvironmental exposure 3afarming systems 3afarms 3ainflammation 3alongitudinal studies 3aodds ratio 3aquestionnaires 3aregression analysis 3arisk factors 3arisk reduction 3astudents 3aswine1 aHjort, Charlotte1 aPedersen, Ole Find1 aMiller, Martin R.1 aSigsgaard, Torben0 tThe Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology.g2011 Oct., v. 128, no. 4 p.761-765dMosby, Inc.x0091-67497nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jaci.2011.06.0063Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01678naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002400147245010200171300001800273520055800291592002800849650001100877650002300888650002300911650002200934650001200956650001900968650001700987700002201004700002801026700001701054700001801071700002001089700001701109773008801126856008101214852000901295655001201304IND60109457520221119230408.0141109e20120128xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010945752DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tet.2011.11.0712doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAkué-Gédu, Rufine10aStudies on pyrrolidinones.

The latter involves an analysis of the current state of renewable energy resources in China as well as the implementation of a renewable energy scale-up development based on pilot work. Using the Zhejiang Small Hydropower Programme financed by the WB as a real-world application case study, a comparison is made between the project management policies espoused in China and those of the WB, with management constraints being examined in detail. Owing to the need for certain modifications to current management techniques, a framework model of programme management is put forward, with the project management office (PMO) at its core, and staged implementation and multi-level management constituting its principal methods. In addition, this model of programme management meets the requirements concerning the policies and procedures stipulated by the WB, with other benefits including a reduction in terms of cost as well as in the duration of the construction of related subprojects. This is especially relevant if we take into consideration the sheer number of small hydropower plants and the diversity of their locations throughout China. This model should therefore be considered for promoting the scale-up development of small hydropower and other renewable energies in China, and its application may have a wider significance.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase studies 3aissues and policy 3amodels 3awater power 3aChina1 aWang, Zhenyu1 aHe, Sanfeng1 aLi, Fuqiang0 tRenewable & sustainable energy reviews.g2013 Aug., v. 24 p.21-31dElsevier Ltdx1364-03217nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rser.2013.03.0453Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02178naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245013700166300001800303520118500321592002801506650002001534650001601554650002201570650002001592700001801612700001301630700001801643700002401661773008901685856008101774852000901855655001201864IND60109531020221122002606.0141109e20120909xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010953102DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tet.2012.06.1022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXing, Xiangyou10aElectronic helix theory-guided rational design of kinetic resolutions by means of the Sharpless asymmetric dihydroxylation reactions  ap. 7288-7294.  aKinetic resolution represents a key chemical reaction strategy for asymmetric synthesis of optically enriched compounds, and it originates from a simple phenomenon that a pair of mirror images (enantiomers) of a racemate can react with different rates under a chiral environment. While highly efficient catalytic kinetic resolutions by means of the classical Sharpless asymmetric epoxidation (AE) reactions are well established in modern organic synthesis, such systems based on the arguably more versatile Sharpless asymmetric dihydroxylation (AD) processes, although long pursued and widely attempted, remain largely underexplored. With insights gained from a new electronic helix theory we recently developed for molecular chirality and chiral interactions, we were able to advance a proposal suggesting why this problem is challenging and how it might be solved. Guided by a new design concept aimed at identifying complimentary catalyst–substrate electronic interactions, we reported herein that not only can such elusive systems be generally feasible, but efficiencies well reach the highest levels known to date with chemical or enzymatic kinetic resolutions of any type.  aPublisher supplied data 3adihydroxylation 3aenantiomers 3aorganic compounds 3astereoisomerism1 aZhao, Yaohong1 aXu, Chen1 aZhao, Xinyang1 aWang, David Zhigang0 tTetrahedron.g2012 Sept. 9, v. 68, no. 36 p.7288-7294dElsevier Ltdx0040-40207nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tet.2012.06.1023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02470naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245015900167300001200326520107100338592002801409650004401437650002201481650001501503650002201518650002001540650003801560650001101598650002001609650000901629650001101638650002401649650001301673650003301686650001101719650002201730650002101752700001701773700001501790700001201805700002101817773008401838856008101922852000902003655001202012IND60110318020221121033757.0141109e20131020xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011031802DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tca.2013.07.0272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Lingjian10aStructure and thermal performance of poly(ethylene glycol) alkyl ether (Brij)/porous silica (MCM-41) composites as shape-stabilized phase change materials  ap. 1-7.  aA series of shape-stabilized phase change materials (PCMs), composed of poly(ethylene glycol) hexadecyl ether (Brij58) or poly(ethylene glycol) octadecyl ether (Brij76) and porous silica (MCM-41), were prepared by the physical mixing method.

Obvious phase transition behavior and energy storage capability are observed for these Brij/MCM-41 composites, and the heat storage efficiency increased with the weight of Brij component. New peak at 18.8° demonstrated that the pore size and the surface adsorption ability of MCM-41 affect the crystallization behavior of Brij molecule.

The authors introduce a subsidiary boundary problem of three-dimensional elasticity theory for the system of partial differential equations describing the harmonic oscillations of the composite caused by a surface load. The problem reduces to a boundary problem for ordinary differential equations by employing the Fourier transform. An algorithm of constructing the Fourier transform of the Green’s matrix of the given boundary problem is presented. The wave numbers of Lamb waves propagating in composites, their phase velocity surfaces and group wave surfaces are presented through the poles of the transform of the Green’s matrix. The authors obtain the dispersion curves for different directions and frequencies and investigate the dispersion curves and surfaces of wave numbers, phase velocities and group wave surfaces for various composites. The numerical results are then compared with the results obtained by applying other methods.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3aequations 3asounds 3aultrasonics1 aKirillova, Evgenia1 aSeemann, Wolfgang1 aSyromyatnikov, Pavel0 tUltrasonics.g2011 Jan., v. 51, no. 1 p.17-28dElsevier B.V.x0041-624X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ultras.2010.05.0033Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02354naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002500152245014800177300001600325520111900341592002801460650001901488650002601507650001201533650001301545650002501558650001401583650002701597700002601624700002901650700002301679700002001702700002501722700002201747700002301769773008101792856008601873852000901959655001201968IND60105443920221121060008.0141108e201204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010544392DNAL7 a10.1016/j.peptides.2012.02.0172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSamgina, Tatyana Yu.10aLC–MS/MS with 2D mass mapping of skin secretions’ peptides as a reliable tool for interspecies identification inside Rana esculenta complex  ap. 296-302.  aIdentification of species constituting Rana esculenta complex represents a certain problem as two parental species Rana ridibunda and Rana lessonae form their hybrid R. esculenta, while external signs and sizes of the members of this complex are intersected. However the composition of skin secretion consisting mainly of peptides is different for the species of the complex. LC–MS/MS is an ideal analytical tool for the quantitative and qualitative analysis of these peptides. The results covering elemental composition of these peptides, their levels in the secretion, as well as their belonging to a certain family of peptides may be visualized by means of 2D mass maps. The proposed approach proved itself to be a perspective tool for the reliable identification of all 3 species constituting R. esculenta complex. Easy distinguishing between the species may be achieved using 2D maps as fingerprints. Besides this approach may be used to study hybridogenesis and mechanisms of hemiclonal transfer of genetic information, when rapid and reliable identification of species involved in the process is required.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRana esculenta 3aelemental composition 3ahybrids 3apeptides 3aqualitative analysis 3asecretion 3aspecies identification1 aGorshkov, Vladimir A.1 aArtemenko, Konstantin A.1 aVorontsov, Egor A.1 aKlykov, Oleg V.1 aOgourtsov, Sergey V.1 aZubarev, Roman A.1 aLebedev, Albert T.0 tPeptides.g2012 Apr., v. 34, no. 2 p.296-302dElsevier Inc.x0196-97817nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.peptides.2012.02.0173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02130naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245015100166300001600317520086400333592002801197650002701225650001901252650001001271650000901281650001301290650001801303650001601321650002201337650001701359650003701376700001601413700001701429700002101446700001501467700001601482700001501498773011601513856008201629852000901711655001201720IND60100789020221119092010.0141105e20120201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010078902DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcis.2011.08.0852doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMukherjee, P.10aSynthesis of uniform gold nanoparticles using non-pathogenic bio-control agent: Evolution of morphology from nano-spheres to triangular nanoprisms  ap. 148-152.  aGreen synthesis of gold nanospheres with uniform diameter and triangular nanoprisms with optically flat surface was carried out using a non-pathogenic bio-control agent Trichoderma asperellum for reduction of HAuCl₄. Kinetics of the reaction was monitored by UV–Vis absorption spectroscopy. No additional capping/complexing agent was used for stabilizing the gold nanoparticles. Evolution of morphology from pseudospherical nanoparticles to triangular nanoprisms was studied by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). It revealed that three or more pseudospheres fused to form nanoprisms of different shapes and sizes. Slow rate of reduction of HAuCl₄ by constituents of cell-free fungal extract was instrumental in producing such exotic morphologies. Isolation of gold nanotriangles from the reacting masses was achieved by differential centrifugation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTrichoderma asperellum 3acentrifugation 3afungi 3agold 3ananogold 3ananoparticles 3ananospheres 3areaction kinetics 3aspectroscopy 3atransmission electron microscopy1 aRoy, Mainak1 aMandal, B.P.1 aChoudhury, Sipra1 aTewari, R.1 aTyagi, A.K.1 aKale, S.P.0 tJournal of colloid and interface science.g2012 Feb. 1, v. 367, no. 1 p.148-152dElsevier Inc.x0021-97977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2011.08.0853Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02270naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245010800167300001600275520137000291592002801661650002301689650001901712650001301731700001401744700001801758773009101776856008101867990002301948852000901971655001201980IND60108757720221121113850.0141108e20130731xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010875772DNAL7 a10.1016/j.snb.2013.04.0912doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Mengying10aMicrochannel plate (MCP) functionalized with Ag nanorods as a high-porosity stable SERS-active membrane  ap. 235-242.  aSurface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) encountered in interstitial gaps between closely positioned metal nanostructures, hot spots, offers tremendous potential for molecular analysis at the trace or single-molecule level. SERS-active sites, hot spots, can be achieved at a higher density when metal nanostructures are configured on a three-dimensional (3D) platform than on a planar two-dimensional (2D) substrate. Yet, 3D platforms demonstrated thus far such as anodized alumina and microstructured fibers offer capillaries/pores either too narrow for the sample to be infused or may not be compatible with microfluidic integration due to their non-planar feature. Here, we introduce a 3D SERS-active platform based on a planar component that is readily available and presents densely packed highly aligned precision microchannels, the so-called microchannel plate (MCP). The microchannels, owing to their alignment biased at a small but precise angle (7°) with respect to the plate surface normal and their reasonably large diameter (~6μm) can be functionalized with Ag nanorods through shadowing-based deposition that requires no other template or lithography. The plate functionalized with Ag nanorods delivers an enhancement factor with values in the range of 10⁶–10⁸ as verified with probing molecules 4-mercatobenzoic acid (4-MBA) and rhodamine-6G.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRaman spectroscopy 3aaluminum oxide 3ananorods1 aCao, Zhen1 aYobas, Levent0 tSensors and actuators.g2013 July 31, v. 184 p.235-242dElsevier B.V.x0925-40057nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.snb.2013.04.0913Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01834naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094024002200132024001900154040001800173100002700191245008100218300001800299506007600317520078300393592002801176506003701204650002301241650001601264650002201280700002901302773009601331856008401427852000901511655001201520IND60109760220221207122344.0141109e20110518xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010976022DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tetlet.2011.03.0042doi7 aPMC31156532pmcid7 a216860952pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDadiboyena, Sureshbabu10aOne pot spiropyrazoline synthesis via intramolecular cyclization/methylation  ap. 2536-2539.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aRegioisomeric spiropyrazolines were synthesized through a tandem intramolecular cyclization/methylation reaction of a functionalized 5,5-disubstituted pyrazoline in one reaction vessel.

STUDY DESIGN: Pediatric trauma patients requiring a blood transfusion (red blood cells, fresh frozen plasma, platelets, or cryoprecipitate) within 24 hours of arrival were included. Coagulation values on emergency department arrival were analyzed, as were clinical details and outcome. RESULTS: A total of 102 children (mean age, 6 years; mean injury severity score 22, mean Glascow Coma Scale 7, 80% blunt trauma victims) were studied over a 4 year period. An abnormal prothrombin time was found in 72%, partial thromboplastin time in 38%, fibrinogen in 52%, hemoglobin in 58%, and platelet count in 23%. An abnormal prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time, and platelet count were strongly associated with mortality (P=.005, .001, and <.0001, respectively) and remained significantly associated in multivariate analysis after adjusting for injury severity score. CONCLUSIONS: Coagulopathy is prevalent in pediatric trauma patients ill enough to require a transfusion and is strongly associated with mortality. Studies are needed to determine whether early coagulation factor replacement and the institution of massive transfusion protocols may improve outcomes in these patients.  aPublisher supplied data 3ablood platelet count 3ablood transfusion 3achildren 3acoagulation 3acoma 3aerythrocytes 3afibrinogen 3ahemoglobin 3amortality 3amultivariate analysis 3apatients 3aprothrombin 3athromboplastin 2aBlood Coagulation Disordersxbloodxdiagnosisxepidemiology. 2aTransfusion Reaction. 2aChild 2aChild, Preschool 2aFemale 2aFollow-Up Studies 2aHumans 2aInjury Severity Score 2aMale 2aPartial Thromboplastin Time 2aPrevalence 2aProthrombin Time 2aTreatment Outcome 2aWounds and Injuriesxmortalityxtherapy.1 aShaz, Beth H.1 aPereira, Greg1 aAtkins, Elizabeth1 aJohnson, Karen K.1 aBao, Gaobin1 aEasley, Kirk A.1 aJosephson, Cassandra D.0 tJournal of pediatrics.g2012 Feb., v. 160, no. 2 p.204-209.e3dMosby, Inc.x0022-34767nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jpeds.2011.08.0193Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03286naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002900148245011600177300002100293500001500314520174700329592002802076650000902104650001902113650001002132650001102142650003602153650002302189650001502212653002102227700002302248700001702271700001902288700001602307700002502323700002102348700002502369700002402394700002002418700002402438700001602462700002502478700002502503700001502528773012302543856008202666990002302748852000902771655001202780IND60100234120221120024855.0141105e201312  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010023412DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jaci.2013.07.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHafkamp-de Groen, Esther10aPredicting asthma in preschool children with asthma-like symptoms: Validating and updating the PIAMA risk score  ap. 1303-1310.e6.  a2019-12-04  aBACKGROUND: The Prevention and Incidence of Asthma and Mite Allergy (PIAMA) risk score predicts the probability of having asthma at school age among preschool children with suggestive symptoms. OBJECTIVE: We sought to externally validate the PIAMA risk score at different ages and in ethnic and socioeconomic subgroups of children in addition to updating it. METHODS: We studied 2877 children with preschool asthma-like symptoms participating in the multiethnic, prospective, population-based cohort study Generation R. The PIAMA risk score was assessed at preschool age, and asthma was predicted at age 6 years. Discrimination (concordance index [C-index]) and calibration were calculated. The PIAMA risk score was updated, and its performance was similarly analyzed. RESULTS: At age 6 years, 6% (168/2877) of the children had asthma. The discriminative ability of the original PIAMA risk score to predict asthma in Generation R was similar compared with that in the PIAMA cohort (C-index = 0.74 vs 0.71). The predicted risks by using the original PIAMA risk score for having asthma at the age of 6 years tended to be slightly higher than the observed risks (8% vs 6%). No differences in discriminative ability were found at different ages or in ethnic and socioeconomic subgroups (P > .05). The updated PIAMA risk score had a C-index of 0.75. CONCLUSIONS: The PIAMA risk score showed good external validity. The discriminative ability was similar at different ages and in ethnic and socioeconomic subgroups of preschool children, which suggests good generalizability. Further studies are needed to reproduce the predictive performance of the updated PIAMA risk score in other populations and settings and to assess its clinical relevance.  aPublisher supplied data 3arisk 3acohort studies 3amites 3aasthma 3anationalities and ethnic groups 3apreschool children 3aprediction 0ahypersensitivity1 aLingsma, Hester F.1 aCaudri, Daan1 aLevie, Deborah1 aWijga, Alet1 aKoppelman, Gerard H.1 aDuijts, Liesbeth1 aJaddoe, Vincent W.V.1 aSmit, Henriëtte A.1 aKerkhof, Marjan1 aMoll, Henriëtte A.1 aHofman, A.,1 aSteyerberg, Ewout W.1 ade Jongste, Johan C.1 aRaat, Hein0 tThe Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology.g2013 Dec., v. 132, no. 6 p.1303-1310.e6dMosby, Inc.x0091-67497nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jaci.2013.07.0073Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03009naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004700094040001800141100001600159245017500175300001800350520148300368592002801851650000801879650001301887650001601900650001701916650001501933650003801948650002001986650002102006650002102027650000902048650001202057650002302069650001102092650001302103650001502116650001702131650001902148650002302167650001602190650002202206650002102228700001502249700001402264700001502278773010802293856009302401852000902494655001202503IND60105919420221118114106.0141108e201312  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010591942DNAL7 a10.1016/j.polymdegradstab.2013.09.0302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSalaün, F.10aMicroencapsulation of bisphenol-A bis (diphenyl phosphate) and influence of particle loading on thermal and fire properties of polypropylene and polyethylene terephtalate  ap. 2663-2671.  aMicroencapsulated flame retardant, bisphenol-A bis (diphenyl phosphate) (BDP), with a silane shell was prepared by sol–gel process with the goal of incorporating them in polymeric matrices by melt blending to improve the flame retardancy of isotactic polypropylene (iPP) and polyethylene terephtalate (PET). The influence of the loading content on thermal transitions has been studied by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), the thermal stability of the polymer/microcapsules composites has been assessed by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and cone calorimetry has been used to study the fire reaction. It was noticed that the microcapsules have a limited influence on the thermal transitions of iPP matrix, but a decrease of the melting and glass transition temperatures was detected for the PET microcomposites. TGA results showed that the addition of microcapsules could improve char formation of the PET systems both in nitrogen and in air atmospheres, whereas only a small improvement of the thermal stability was detected in oxidative atmosphere for the iPP samples. Furthermore, cone calorimeter experiments show that the incorporation of microcapsules in the iPP gives almost no improvement in the iPP fire reaction. However, the microcapsules act as flame retardant in PET reducing the heat release rate during the combustion and the total heat evolved. Therefore, microcapsules can act as a char promoter agent to enhance the fire resistance in the case of PET.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3abiphenyl 3abisphenol A 3acalorimeters 3acombustion 3adifferential scanning calorimetry 3afire resistance 3aflame retardants 3aglass transition 3aheat 3amelting 3amicroencapsulation 3amixing 3anitrogen 3aphosphates 3apolyethylene 3apolypropylenes 3asol-gel processing 3atemperature 3athermal stability 3athermogravimetry1 aCreach, G.1 aRault, F.1 aGiraud, S.0 tPolymer degradation and stability.g2013 Dec., v. 98, no. 12 p.2663-2671dElsevier Ltdx0141-39107nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.polymdegradstab.2013.09.0303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02157naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002600150245015200176300001400328520110900342592002801451650002501479650001001504650001401514650002401528650002001552650003101572700002401603700002401627773009901651856008401750852000901834655001201843IND60101929620221116190007.0141106e20120901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010192962DNAL7 a10.1016/j.memsci.2012.02.0642doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKazemi, Mohammad Amin10aModeling of transient permeate flux decline during crossflow microfiltration of non-alcoholic beer with consideration of particle size distribution  ap. 13-21.  aCrossflow microfiltration of non-alcoholic beer is investigated numerically and it has been verified by experimental data. Due to the presence of particles with different sizes in feed suspension, a modified combination of three mechanisms of particle back-diffusion is developed to predict particle deposition and cake layer buildup during the process. The simulation results show that smaller particles (about 1μm) are the main contributor to the cake layer due to a minimum in back transport and are the main reason of the flux decline. On the other hand, larger particles (aₚ>20μm) are swept away along the membrane during the filtration process and move toward the membrane exit due to the crossflow. Therefore, the cake enriches with finer particles as the permeate flux decreases. The specific cake resistance was determined experimentally and Carman–Kozeny equation fails to provide a complete theoretical perspective of specific resistance of irregular, non-uniformly sized particles that formed the cake layer. The results of numerical simulation are in good agreement with observed data.  aPublisher supplied data 3aartificial membranes 3abeers 3aequations 3amathematical models 3amicrofiltration 3aparticle size distribution1 aSoltanieh, Mohammad1 aYazdanshenas, Mehdi0 tJournal of membrane science.g2012 Sept. 1, v. 411-412 p.13-21dElsevier B.V.x0376-73887nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.memsci.2012.02.0643Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02099naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001200152245008800164300001600252520101700268592002801285650002801313650001301341650001301354650001101367650000901378650002201387650001601409700001901425700001301444700001501457700001501472700001901487773010101506856008601607990002301693852000901716655001201725IND60102488020221117191537.0141106e20130905xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010248802DNAL7 a10.1016/j.molstruc.2013.05.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDai, Li14aThe effect of In³⁺ doping on the optical characteristics of Ho:LiNbO₃ crystals  ap. 262-266.  aA series of Ho:LiNbO₃ crystals doped with x mol% In³⁺ ions (x=0, 1, 3 and 5mol%) were grown by the conventional Czochralski technique. Up-conversion emission spectra was observed under 808nm femtosecond laser excitation in the In³⁺ doped Ho:LiNbO₃ crystals at room temperature. The experimental results indicate that blue, green, violet and red up-conversion emission can be obtained from In³⁺ doped Ho:LiNbO₃ crystals. From the pump energy dependence investigation, it is known that the up-conversion mechanism is the two-photon process. The light-induced scattering was investigated as a function of exposure energy. The effect of In³⁺ on the optical characteristics of Ho³⁺ in LiNbO₃ crystal was investigated and concluded, and is reported here. The surface the as-prepared In³⁺ doped Ho:LiNbO₃ is very smooth and practically free of droplets as highlighted by atomic force microscopy (AFM). The root-mean-square (rms) surface roughness of the sample was determined to be 11.573nm.  aPublisher supplied data 3aatomic force microscopy 3acrystals 3adroplets 3aenergy 3aions 3asurface roughness 3atemperature1 aZhou, Zhiqiang1 aXu, Chao1 aXu, Yuheng1 aLi, Dayong1 aChen, Chuntian0 tJournal of molecular structure.g2013 Sept. 5, v. 1047 p.262-266dElsevier B.V.x0022-28607nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.molstruc.2013.05.0163Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02165naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002500151245013100176300001800307520102900325592002801354650001701382650001401399650002901413650002001442650001501462650001701477650002601494650002001520700003001540700002901570700003601599773008601635856008501721852000901806655001201815IND60109135320221121221720.0141109e20110915xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010913532DNAL7 a10.1016/j.talanta.2011.06.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTormin, Thiago Faria10aFast and direct determination of butylated hydroxyanisole in biodiesel by batch injection analysis with amperometric detection  ap. 1274-1278.  aWe report here, for the first time, application of batch injection analysis (BIA) with amperometric detection for determination of the phenolic antioxidant butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA) in biodiesel. A sample plug was directly injected onto a boron-doped diamond electrode immersed in 50% v/v hydroethanolic solution with 0.1molL⁻¹ HClO₄ using an electronic micropipette. Importantly, the only preparation step required for biodiesel analysis is dilution in the same hydroethanolic electrolyte solution. Our proposed method has several advantages for routine biodiesel analysis, including: a low relative standard deviation between injections (0.29%, n=20), high analytical frequency (120h⁻¹), adequate recovery values (93–101%) for spiked samples, satisfactory accuracy (based on comparative determinations by high-performance liquid-chromatography), and a low detection limit (100ng of BHA per g of biodiesel). Finally, our method can be adapted for the determination of other antioxidants in biodiesel samples.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantioxidants 3abiodiesel 3abutylated hydroxyanisole 3adetection limit 3aelectrodes 3aelectrolytes 3aliquid chromatography 3aperchloric acid1 aGimenes, Denise Tofanello1 aRichter, Eduardo Mathias1 aMunoz, Rodrigo Alejandro Abarza0 tTalanta.g2011 Sept. 15, v. 85, no. 3 p.1274-1278dElsevier B.V.x0039-91407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.talanta.2011.06.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02634naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001300151245019300164300001400357520136900371592002801740650002501768650002201793650001401815650002401829650000901853650000701862650001901869650003301888650002001921700001401941700001301955700001101968700001201979700001301991700001402004700001402018773009802032856008502130852000902215655001202224IND60101388620221116221232.0141106e20111015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010138862DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhazmat.2011.06.0632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYi, X.S.10aOptimization of complex conditions by response surface methodology for APAM–oil/water emulsion removal from aqua solutions using nano-sized TiO₂/Al₂O₃ PVDF ultrafiltration membrane  ap. 37-44.  aThis paper studies the cumulative effect of various parameters, namely anionic polyacrylamide (APAM) concentration, oil concentration, pH, trans-membrane pressure (TMP), and total dissolved solid (TDS), and obtains optimal parameters for the minimum relative flux (J/J₀) declining in aqueous solutions with response surface methodology (RSM). In order to analyze the mutual interaction and optimal values of parameters affecting ultrafiltration, a central composite rotatable design (CCRD), one method of RSM, was employed. The analysis of variance (ANOVA) of the cubic polynomial model demonstrated that this model was highly significant and reliable. The results show that the effect of APAM and oil on J/J₀ has an inverse trend with pH value increasing. Moreover, the mutual interaction of initial APAM (oil) concentration (CAPAM₍ₒᵢₗ₎) and pH (TMP) were negligible, while the mutual interaction of CAPAM and Cₒᵢₗ has an obvious effect, i.e. the effect of initial feed CAPAM became more important at higher values of initial feed Cₒᵢₗ, and the J/J₀ was only about 4%. The favorable operate conditions in this ultrafiltration process were at low CAPAM, Cₒᵢₗ, pH, and TMP, which agreed with the conclusions of many authors, while considering water production, CAPAM and Cₒᵢₗ<50mg/L, pH<4, and TMP<0.075MPa could be accepted.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanalysis of variance 3aaqueous solutions 3aemulsions 3amathematical models 3aoils 3apH 3apolyacrylamide 3aresponse surface methodology 3aultrafiltration1 aShi, W.X.1 aS.L.Yu, 1 aMa, C.1 aSun, N.1 aWang, S.1 aJin, L.M.1 aSun, L.P.0 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2011 Oct. 15, v. 193 p.37-44dElsevier B.V.x0304-38947nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2011.06.0633Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01993naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245012100163300001600284520069300300592002800993650002101021650003001042650001901072650001601091650001001107650001901117650004401136650001301180650002201193650001201215700001901227700002601246700001501272700001901287700002301306700002001329773010901349856008101458990002301539852000901562655001201571IND60107614520221122174547.0141108e201109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010761452DNAL7 a10.1016/j.pep.2011.05.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPrchal, Jan10aExpression and purification of myristoylated matrix protein of Mason-Pfizer monkey virus for NMR and MS measurements  ap. 122-127.  aMatrix proteins play multiple roles both in early and late stages of the viral replication cycle.

An efficient, single-step purification procedure eliminating all contaminating proteins including, importantly, the non-myristoylated matrix protein was designed.

About 50% of them were invasive isolates. The strains were isolated from patients of all age groups and 33.55% were isolated from children below 5 years. The majority was isolated from blood (48.53%) and other sterile specimens (6.30%). Community acquired pneumonia (41.70%) is the most common diagnosis followed by sepsis (9.54%). Serotyping was done using Pneumotest Plus-Kit and antibiotic susceptibility pattern was determined by modified Kirby–Bauer disk diffusion method and measurement of minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) using E-test strip. Ten most common serotypes were 19F (15.02%), 6B (10.62%), 19A (6.93%), 14 (6.70%), 1 (5.08%), 6A (5.08%), 23F (4.85%), 18C (3.93%), 3 (2.08%) and 5 (1.85%). Penicillin MIC ranged between ≤0.012–4μg/ml with MIC₉₀ of 1μg/ml. Penicillin resistant rate is 31.78%. The majority of penicillin less-susceptible strains belonged to serotype 19F followed by 19A and 6B. Based on the serotypes distribution 22 (44.00%), 28 (56.00%) and 39 (78.00%) of the invasive isolates from children ≤2 years were belonged to serotypes included in the PCV7, PCV10 and PCV13, respectively.  aPublisher supplied data 3aStreptococcus pneumoniae 3aantibiotic resistance 3aantibiotics 3ablood 3achildren 3ahospitals 3aminimum inhibitory concentration 3apatients 3apneumonia 3aserotypes 3avaccines1 aZin, Norni Mohd1 aHussin, Azura1 aNawi, Salbiah Haji1 aHanapiah, Suhailah Md1 aWahab, Zubaidah Abdul1 aRaj, Ganeswarie1 aShafie, Norazita1 aPeng, Ng Pey1 aChu, Keah K.1 aAziz, Muhhamad Nazri1 aManing, Nurahan1 aMohamad, Jamilah Said1 aBenjamin, Adom1 aSalleh, Mohd.

When the polymer layer absorbs alcohol vapor molecules from ambient air, the swelling of the thin polymer layer leads to bending of the Si bridge which causes the piezoresistive Wheatstone bridge to produce an output voltage. A theoretical model of the interaction between Si bridge and polymer layer is presented based on elastic mechanics theory. An equivalent transverse gas load is presented. The output expression of sensor is obtained. The model of the sensor is verified by the experimental results. The experimental results show that the alcohol vapor sensor has good linearity, selectivity and reproducibility.

This approach is well-suited for explaining the perception of illusory contours such as Kanizsa’s figure (see Petitot (2008) for a review). In its current version, neurogeometry uses achromatic inputs to the visual system as the starting-point for form estimation. Here we ask how neurogeometry operates when the input is chromatic as in color vision. We propose that even when considering only the perception of form, the random nature of the cone mosaic must be taken into account. The main challenge for neurogeometry is to explain how achromatic information could be estimated from the sparse chromatic sampling provided by the cone mosaic. This article also discusses the non-linearity involved in a neural geometry for chromatic processing. We present empirical results on color discrimination to illustrate the geometric complexity for the discrimination contour when the adaptation state of the observer is not conditioned. The underlying non-linear geometry must conciliate both mosaic sampling and regulation of visual information in the visual system.  aPublisher supplied data 3acolor 3acolor vision 3acortex 3aneurons1 aMéary, David0 tJournal of Physiology - Paris.g2012 , v. 106, no. 5-6 p.284-296dElsevier Ltdx0928-42577nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jphysparis.2012.02.0023Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01289naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245006700169300001600236520036100252592002800613650001200641650002200653650001300675650001300688650001500701650001100716700002000727700002300747700001700770773008300787856008400870852000900954655001200963IND60104767220221118074532.0161023e20130221xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010476722DNAL7 a10.1016/j.molcel.2013.01.0292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMann, Matthias14aThe Coming Age of Complete, Accurate, and Ubiquitous Proteomes  ap. 583-590.  aHigh-resolution mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics has progressed tremendously over the years.

Here, we demonstrate that designed structures of energetic oxidizers with various interfacial contact areas for fuel nanoparticles (NPs) can enhance the explosive reactivities of ignited EM pellets. The measured burn rates and pressurization rates for specific samples of Al NP/porous CuO nanowire (NW) composite pellets were found to be much higher than those for Al NP/CuO NP and Al NP/CuO microparticle (MP) composite pellets. In addition, the explosive reactivities of the EM pellets decreased linearly with increasing pellet density for all compositions of Al NPs/CuO MPs, Al NPs/CuO NPs, and Al NPs/CuO NWs. This suggests that the size and morphology of the oxidizer structures (from solid MPs to porous NWs) and the pellet density of the resulting EM pellets have a synergistic effect, significantly changing the interfacial contact area with the fuel NPs so that the explosive reactivity of the resulting EM pellets can be controlled precisely.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaluminum 3acombustion 3acupric oxide 3afuels 3ananoparticles 3ananowires 3aoxidants 3apellets 3apowders 3asynergism1 aKim, Chi-hun,1 aKim, Jong Man1 aLee, Deug Woo1 aPark, Jong Kweon1 aLee, Donggeun1 aKim, Soo Hyung0 tPowder technology.g2013 June, v. 241 p.67-73dElsevier B.V.x0032-59107nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.powtec.2013.03.0173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02640naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002400150245015700174300001600331520132500347592002801672650001201700650001801712650001601730650002601746650002101772650001101793650002401804650001901828650001801847650001201865650002601877650003401903650002001937700002901957700002601986773010202012856008402114990002302198852000902221655001202230IND60110625620221120081040.0141109e20120903xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011062562DNAL7 a10.1016/j.toxlet.2012.06.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHendriks, Hester S.10aModulation of human α₄β₂ nicotinic acetylcholine receptors by brominated and halogen-free flame retardants as a measure for in vitro neurotoxicity  ap. 266-274.  aBrominated flame retardants (BFRs) are abundant persistent organic pollutants with well-studied toxicity. The toxicological and ecological concern associated with BFRs argues for replacement by safer alternatives. However, the (neuro)toxic potential of alternative halogen-free flame retardants (HFFRs) is unknown. Previous research identified the nervous system as a sensitive target organ for BFRs, with modulation of excitatory nicotinic acetylcholine (nACh) receptors as one of the modes of action. Since it is essential to assess the (neuro)toxic potential of HFFRs before large scale use, we measured the effects of three BFRs and 13 HFFRs on the function of human α₄β₂ nACh receptors, expressed in Xenopus oocytes, using the two-electrode voltage-clamp technique. The results demonstrate that some BFRs (TBBPA and to a lesser extent BDE-209) and HFFRs (TPP, Alpi, APP, MMT and to a lesser extent ATH, ATO, MHO, MPP, RDP and ZHS) act as nACh receptor antagonists. Contrary, BPS, BDP, DOPO and ZS were unable to modulate nACh receptors. Despite the lack of toxicological data on HFFRs and the need for additional studies to perform a full (neuro)toxic risk assessment, the current data on antagonistic effects on nACh receptors could be an important step in prioritizing viable HFFRs for substitution of BFRs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aXenopus 3aacetylcholine 3aantagonists 3acholinergic receptors 3aflame retardants 3ahumans 3amechanism of action 3anervous system 3aneurotoxicity 3aoocytes 3apatch-clamp technique 3apersistent organic pollutants 3arisk assessment1 avan Kleef, Regina G.D.M.1 aWesterink, Remco H.S.0 tToxicology letters.g2012 Sept. 3, v. 213, no. 2 p.266-274dElsevier Ireland Ltdx0378-42747nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.toxlet.2012.06.0133Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01229naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002600152245007700178300001800255520032300273592002800596650001600624650004400640650001300684700002100697700001800718773008500736856008600821990002300907852000900930655001200939IND60109052520221120161334.0141109e201209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010905252DNAL7 a10.1016/j.steroids.2012.04.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIbrahim-Ouali, Malika10aStereoselective synthesis of pentacyclic steroids functionalized at C-11  ap. 1092-1100.  aWe set out to describe an efficient and versatile method for preparing pentacyclic steroids diversely substituted at C-11 from cholic acid, via a stereoselective epoxidation and the epoxide opening as the key steps.

Main plots were herbicide treatments (0, 52.5 ++ 17.5, and 105 ++ 35 g ai/ha for imazapic and imazapyr, respectively) and subplots were five intervals (0, 30, 60, 90, and 120 d) between the herbicide application and rotational crop planting. Soil samples were collected for a cucumber bioassay and chemical residues analysis at each time interval. The dissipation time (DT₅₀) of the herbicides in the soil was greater in Londrina than Palmeira, for both imazapic (54 d vs. 27 d, respectively) and imazapyr (40 d vs. 33 d, respectively), probably due to the lower pH and greater clay content of the soil in Londrina compared with Palmeira. The DT₅₀ for both herbicides tended to increase slightly in no-till compared with conventional tillage but the differences were not great. Soybean was the least sensitive rotational crop, with a period for no yield drag (PINYD) of 87 d in Londrina and 88 d in Palmeira. Wheat and edible bean showed intermediate sensitivity. The PINYD for wheat and edible bean was 99 and 98 d for Londrina and 91 and 97 d for Palmeira, respectively. Corn was the most sensitive, with a PINYD of 117 d in Londrina and 97 d in Palmeira. Cucumber was more sensitive to imazapic and imazapyr residues than the rotational crops and should be an effective bioassay to indicate when rotational crops can be safely planted.Nomenclature: Corn, Zea mays L.; cucumber, Cucumis sativus L.; edible bean, Phaseolus vulgaris L., soybean, Glycine max (L.)

We examined the functional basis for this association and identified linkage between rs211718 and the intragenic synonymous polymorphic variant c.1161A>G in ACADM exon 11 (rs1061337). Employing minigene studies we show that the c.1161A allele is associated with exon 11 missplicing, and that the c.1161G allele corrects this missplicing. This may result in production of more full length MCAD protein from the c.1161G allele. Our analysis suggests that the improved splicing of the c.1161G allele is due to changes in the relative binding of splicing regulatory proteins SRSF1 and hnRNP A1. Using publicly available pre-aligned RNA-seq data, we find that the ACADM c.1161G allele is expressed at significantly higher levels than the c.1161A allele across different tissues. This supports that c.1161A>G is a functional SNP, which leads to higher MCAD expression, perhaps due to improved splicing. This study is a proof of principle that synonymous SNPs are not neutral. By changing the binding sites for splicing regulatory proteins they can have significant effects on pre-mRNA splicing and thus protein function. In addition, this study shows that for a sequence variation to have an effect, it might need to change the balance in the relative binding of positive and negative splicing factors.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalleles 3abeta oxidation 3abinding sites 3ablood serum 3aexons 3amedium chain fatty acids 3ametabolomics 3aregulatory proteins 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 3atissues1 aDoktor, Thomas Koed1 aAndresen, Brage Storstein0 tMolecular genetics and metabolism.g2013 , v. 110, no. 1-2 p.122-128dElsevier Inc.x1096-71927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ymgme.2013.06.0053Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03512naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245022100171300001800392520196000410592002802370650002702398650002902425650001302454650002202467650002002489650001702509650002102526650001202547650001402559650001202573650001302585651001102598700002202609700002602631700002602657700002602683700001902709700002102728700002302749700002102772700002102793710003702814773008502851856008502936852000903021655001203030IND60111240220221119124610.0141109e20121214xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011124022DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vaccine.2012.10.0402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWeckx, Lily Yin12aA phase 3, randomized, double-blind trial comparing the safety and immunogenicity of the 7-valent and 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccines, given with routine pediatric vaccinations, in healthy infants in Brazil  ap. 7566-7572.  aBACKGROUND: The inclusion of 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV7) into national immunization programs in many countries has significantly decreased the incidence of disease caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae. However, a substantial portion of disease remained and, in some areas, there has been an increase in disease produced by serotypes not included in PCV7. A 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) was studied in healthy Brazilian infants in a phase 3, double-blind, randomized study. METHODS: Infants were randomized to receive either PCV7 or PCV13 at 2, 4, 6, (doses 1–3), and 12 (toddler dose) months of age, along with routine pediatric vaccinations (diphtheria, tetanus, whole-cell pertussis, and Haemophilus influenzae type b vaccine). Pneumococcal anticapsular polysaccharide-binding immunoglobulin G (IgG) responses and antibody responses to pertussis antigens were measured 1 month after both dose 3 of the infant series and the toddler dose. Safety and tolerability were also assessed. RESULTS: The proportion of subjects achieving a serotype-specific IgG concentration ≥0.35μg/mL measured 1 month after the infant series was comparable in the PCV13 (≥94.2%) and PCV7 (≥93.0%) groups for the 7 serotypes common to both vaccines. The percentage of responders for the 6 additional serotypes ranged from 87.1 to 100% for PCV13. The percentage of responders varied across the pertussis antigens studied, but was not different in PCV13 and PCV7 recipients. Overall, the safety profile of PCV13 was comparable with that of PCV7. CONCLUSIONS: PCV13 was comparable to PCV7 in safety and tolerability, elicited comparable immune responses to the common serotypes, and did not interfere with immune responses to concomitantly administered whole-cell pertussis vaccine. The robust immunogenicity exhibited by PCV13 for the additional serotypes suggests that it could provide significant protection against these serotypes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHaemophilus influenzae 3aStreptococcus pneumoniae 3aantigens 3adisease incidence 3aimmune response 3aimmunization 3aimmunoglobulin G 3ainfants 3aserotypes 3atetanus 3avaccines 3aBrazil1 aThompson, Allison1 aBerezin, Eitan Naaman1 aFaria, Sonia Maria de1 aCunha, Clovis Arns da1 aPride, Michael1 aPatterson, Scott1 aGruber, William C.1 aEmini, Emilio A.1 aScott, Daniel A.2 aOn behalf of the 012 Study Group0 tVaccine.g2012 Dec. 14, v. 30, no. 52 p.7566-7572dElsevier Ltdx0264-410X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2012.10.0403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02295naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002200148245007900170300001300249520105100262592002801313650001501341650001401356650002301370650002301393650001101416650001101427650001301438650002101451650000901472650001801481650001101499650002201510650002401532650001101556650001701567700001901584700001601603700002301619700002301642773009301665856008201758852000901840655001201849IND60100234320221120032031.0141105e20110103xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010023432DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcat.2010.10.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSitthisa, Surapas10aKinetics and mechanism of hydrogenation of furfural on Cu/SiO₂ catalysts  ap. 1-13.  aThe hydrogenation/hydrodeoxygenation of furfural was studied on a Cu/SiO₂ catalyst at 230–290°C. Detailed kinetics, density function (DFT) calculations, and spectroscopic studies were combined to investigate this reaction. A Langmuir–Hinshelwood model was found to fit the kinetic data well and provided the parameters of physical significance. The heat of adsorption (ΔHₐdₛ) of furfural, derived from the fitting, was found to be significantly higher than those of furfuryl alcohol and 2-methyl furan. Activation energies for the conversion of furfural and furfuryl alcohol were both about 12kcal/mol. DFT calculations and DRIFTS provided guidance about the nature of the surface species. Accordingly, the most likely species adsorbed on the Cu surface is suggested to be a top η¹(O)-aldehyde. DFT calculations of the reaction path show that the predicted energy barriers are of the same order as the experimental values and suggest that the hydrogenation of furfural can occur via either an alkoxide or ahydroxyalkyl intermediate.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3achemical reduction 3acopper 3aenergy 3afurfural 3afurfuryl alcohol 3aheat 3ahydrogenation 3amodels 3areaction kinetics 3areaction mechanisms 3asilica 3aspectroscopy1 aSooknoi, Tawan1 aMa, Yuguang1 aBalbuena, Perla B.1 aResasco, Daniel E.0 tJournal of catalysis.g2011 Jan. 3, v. 277, no. 1 p.1-13dElsevier Inc.x0021-95177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcat.2010.10.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02399naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245016300166300001600329520129300345592002801638650001301666650002501679650001201704650001501716650003001731650001601761650001101777700001601788700001401804700001901818700001801837773010101855856008401956852000902040655001202049IND60101929820221116190002.0141106e20120901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010192982DNAL7 a10.1016/j.memsci.2012.04.0242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Xianhui10aIn situ investigation of fouling behavior in submerged hollow fiber membrane module under sub-critical flux operation via ultrasonic time domain reflectometry  ap. 137-145.  aThis study described the extension of ultrasonic time-domain reflectometry (UTDR) for monitoring the fouling profile in a submerged hollow fiber membrane module under different operation conditions including aeration rate, fiber length and operational flux. Five 10MHz ultrasonic transducers employed were mounted along the tubular test module with a single hollow fiber membrane evenly. A polyethersulfone hollow fiber membrane with inside and outside diameter of 1.0 and 1.6mm was employed to treat 5g/L yeast suspension. The experimental results showed that the fouling could not be completely prevented under the operation of the sub-critical flux, and still deposited at the upper part of the submerged hollow fiber membrane. The progress of foulant deposition onto the membrane surface gradually migrated from top to bottom and reached the plateau finally. Further, the increase of aeration and curtailing fiber length could only slow down fouling and reduce deposition rate to some extent, but could not fully avoid the membrane fouling. Moreover, UTDR technique was successfully employed to measure the relationship between the operational flux and particle deposition on the membrane surface so as to obtain threshold flux, under which could obviously alleviate membrane fouling.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaeration 3aartificial membranes 3afouling 3amonitoring 3atime domain reflectometry 3aultrasonics 3ayeasts1 aLi, Jianxin1 aWang, Jie1 aZhang, Hongwei1 aPan, Yongdong0 tJournal of membrane science.g2012 Sept. 1, v. 411-412 p.137-145dElsevier B.V.x0376-73887nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.memsci.2012.04.0243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02352naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245014100171300001600312520123700328592002801565650002201593650001001615650001801625650001401643650001801657650000701675650001501682650001201697650001701709700002801726700001901754773010001773856008501873990002301958852000901981655001201990IND60100029320221119032901.0141105e20130325xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010002932DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijpharm.2013.02.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSingh, Harinder10aEncapsulation of Rifampicin in a solid lipid nanoparticulate system to limit its degradation and interaction with Isoniazid at acidic pH  ap. 106-111.  aRifampicin (RIF), a vital constituent of antitubercular therapy, hydrolyzes at the acidic pH of the stomach. The degradation is further enhanced by its interaction with Isoniazid (INH). Extent of RIF decomposition, in the presence and absence of INH, was determined at pH 1.2 (pH of empty stomach) at 37°C for 4h (maximum stomach residence time). Both the drugs decomposed at gastric pH (26.5% and 1.43% for RIF and INH respectively). Considering that solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs) avert drug–drug interaction and also drug degradation, we incorporated RIF into SLNs. Latter reduced its degradation to ∼9% (from 26.50% when present alone) and to ∼20% (from 48.81% when INH was also present). Subsequent to this, we also incorporated INH into SLNs and the percent degradation of RIF in this combination (RIF SLNs+INH SLNs) further reduced to 12.35%. Furthermore, the degradation of INH in combination with RIF also reduced significantly from 13.2% to 2.7% when both the drugs were encapsulated individually within SLNs. Study therefore highlights the need to develop combinations of antitubercular drugs (ATDs) with caution and also establishes the usefulness of nanoparticulate technology to avoid drug–drug interaction.  aPublisher supplied data 3adrug interactions 3adrugs 3aencapsulation 3aisoniazid 3ananoparticles 3apH 3arifampicin 3astomach 3atherapeutics1 aBhaṇḍārī, Rohita,1 aKaur, Indu Pal0 tSensors and actuators.g2013 Mar. 25, v. 446, no. 1-2 p.106-111dElsevier B.V.x0378-51737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijpharm.2013.02.0123Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01991naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002200152245010300174300001600277520097500293592002801268650001201296650001101308650001901319650001101338650001601349650001301365700001601378700001801394700002201412773010101434856008601535990002301621852000901644655001201653IND60102488220221117192424.0141106e20130905xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010248822DNAL7 a10.1016/j.molstruc.2013.04.0732doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMakrlík, Emanuel10aInteraction of protonated tyramine with a hexaarylbenzene-based receptor: Extraction and DFT study  ap. 277-281.  aFrom extraction experiments and γ-activity measurements, the extraction constant corresponding to the equilibrium HL⁺(aq)+1·Cs⁺(nb)⇔1·HL⁺(nb)+Cs⁺(aq) taking place in the two-phase water–nitrobenzene system (HL⁺=protonated tyramine, 1=hexaarylbenzene-based receptor; aq=aqueous phase, nb=nitrobenzene phase) was evaluated as logKₑₓ(HL⁺, 1·Cs⁺)=−0.3±0.1.

This pilot plant allows testing different elements and reverse-flow pulse cleaning strategies using real coal ash and under diverse operating conditions such as temperature and pressure. The aim of the on-going research is the evaluation of the alternatives for hot gas filtration technologies and the optimisation of the operation and performance of the filtering elements. The first experimental campaign carried out in the filtration facility commenced in 2005. Four types of elements were tested at maximum temperature and pressure of 235°C and 7.5barg respectively. This paper describes the main results obtained during the second phase of the experimental campaign, in which the temperature was increased up to 370–550°C. Three types of elements (one type of bag filter and two types of candles) were tested. Main parameters investigated for the characterisation of the filtering elements performance were the pressure drop across the element, the cleaning pulse interval, the baseline pressure drop, the filtration efficiency and the durability of the elements. Dependences on the particle loading and temperature among others were also established. Results obtained and conclusions extracted provide a useful tool for the implementation of the filtration technologies at industrial scale.  aPublisher supplied data 3acleaning 3acoal 3adurability 3afilters 3afiltration 3afunding 3apower generation 3atemperature1 aNavarrete, B.1 aAlonso-Fariñas, B.1 aRodriguez-Galan, M.0 tFuel.g2013 June, v. 108 p.24-30dElsevier Ltdx0016-23617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fuel.2011.12.0383Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01407naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245007000163300001800233520053200251592002800783650002300811650002300834650002200857700002200879700001800901700002000919773008800939856008101027852000901108655001201117IND60109369220221120140721.0141109e20110513xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010936922DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tet.2011.03.0372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAzzena, Ugo10aReducing versus basic properties of 1,2-diaryl-1,2-disodioethanes  ap. 3470-3475.  aThe outcome of the reaction between halogenated arylacetic acids and 1,2-diaryl-1,2-disodioethanes strongly depends on the nature of both reaction partners, and it can be rationalized in terms of a competition between reducing and basic properties of the vic-diorganometals, as well as of the ease of the reductive cleavage of the different carbon–halide bonds.

The CdO nanostructures which exhibit a profile of natural leaveleaf were synthesized via a solvothermal approach combining with an annealing process. The solvothermally synthesized CdS precursors were converted into CdO under an optimal annealing condition. In gas-sensing measurements, acetone and diethyl ether were employed as target gases. The results show that the as-fabricated gas sensor exhibits fast response and recovery speeds toward analytes. The mechanism for the improved performance was demonstrated from the gas diffusion through the 3D hierarchical nanostructure. The kinetic processes of gas adsorption and desorption show that the 3D leaveleaf-shaped structure is significant to achieve an enhanced diffusing property. Additionally, a principal component analysis method was used to investigate the recognizable ability of the presented sensor. It is found that acetone and diethyl ether can be distinguished clearly. These findings indicate that the bio-inspired CdO nanostructure can be a promising candidate for the development of fast-responding gas sensors. Moreover, such bio-inspired structure would be also valuable for the design of some other novel nanomaterials.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetone 3aadsorption 3aannealing 3adesorption 3agases 3ananomaterials 3aprincipal component analysis1 aLiu, Jinyun1 aHan, Tianli1 aZhang, Xiaoman1 aMeng, Fanli1 aLiu, Jinhuai0 tSensors and actuators.g2013 July 31, v. 184 p.260-267dElsevier B.V.x0925-40057nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.snb.2013.04.0763Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02695naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094024002200133024001900155040001800174100001700192245008300209300001600292506007600308520135700384592002801741506003701769650002201806650001101828650001001839650001901849650001301868650001301881650001201894650001701906650002201923650001201945700002001957700001901977700001801996700001702014700001802031773010602049856008502155852000902240655001202249IND60101022320221207103324.0141105e20120328xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010102232DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jconrel.2011.12.0082doi7 aPMC33192442pmcid7 a222070732pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, Jaesung10aLinearized oncolytic adenoviral plasmid DNA delivered by bioreducible polymers  ap. 451-460.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aAs an effort to overcome limits of adenovirus (Ad) as a systemic delivery vector for cancer therapy, we developed a novel system using oncolytic Ad plasmid DNA with two bioreducible polymers: arginine-grafted bioreducible poly(disulfide amine)polymer (ABP) and PEG5k-conjugated ABP (ABP5k) in expectation of oncolytic effect caused by progeny viral production followed by replication. The linearized Ad DNAs for active viral replication polyplexed with each polymer were able to replicate only in human cancer cells and produce progeny viruses. The non-immunogenic polymers delivering the DNAs markedly elicited to evade the innate and adaptive immune response. The biodistribution ratio of the polyplexes administered systemically was approximately 99% decreased in liver when compared with naked Ad. Moreover, tumor-to-liver ratio of the Ad DNA delivered by ABP or ABP5k was significantly elevated at 229- or 419-fold greater than that of naked Ad, respectively. The ABP5k improved the chance of the DNA to localize within tumor versus liver with 1.8-fold increased ratio. In conclusion, the innovative and simple system for delivering oncolytic Ad plasmid DNA with the bioreducible polymers, skipping time-consuming steps such as generation and characterization of oncolytic Ad vectors, can be utilized as an alternative approach for cancer therapy.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aadaptive immunity 3ahumans 3aliver 3aneoplasm cells 3aplasmids 3apolymers 3aprogeny 3atherapeutics 3avirus replication 3aviruses1 aKim, Pyung-Hwan1 aNam, Hye Yeong1 aLee, Jung-Sun1 aYun, Chae-Ok1 aKim, Sung Wan0 tJournal of controlled release.g2012 Mar. 28, v. 158, no. 3 p.451-460dElsevier B.V.x0168-36597nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jconrel.2011.12.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03018naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002200151245019400173300001800367500001500385520138100400592002801781650001301809650003001822650001701852650001101869650003101880650001301911650002001924650001601944650002201960650001201982650002101994650002602015650001402041650001802055650001802073653002502091700002202116700002402138700002502162700001502187700002702202700001502229700002102244700002202265700002302287773008402310856008502394852000902479655001202488IND60111084520221120180633.0141109e20110805xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011108452DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vaccine.2011.06.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDevlin, Joanne M.10aHorizontal transmission dynamics of a glycoprotein G deficient candidate vaccine strain of infectious laryngotracheitis virus and the effect of vaccination on transmission of virulent virus  ap. 5699-5704.  a2019-12-04  aInfectious laryngotracheitis virus (ILTV) is an alphaherpesvirus that causes acute respiratory disease in chickens worldwide. The virus is horizontally transmitted and causes large outbreaks of disease. Recent studies have shown that a glycoprotein G deficient candidate vaccine strain of ILTV (ΔgG ILTV) is safe and protects birds from disease following challenge with virulent virus. This study examined the transmission dynamics of this candidate vaccine and of ILTV in field and experimental settings. The reproduction ratio (R₀, average number of secondary infectious cases from a typical infectious case) was calculated from the growth rate of disease epidemics in broiler flocks. Assuming a latent period of 2 days and an infectious period of 4 days R₀ was estimated to be 2.43 (95% CI 2.25–2.69). In experimental settings the transmission characteristics of ΔgG ILTV were similar to those of wildtype virus, and importantly ΔgG ILTV remained safe following one in vivo passage and subsequent infection via contact-exposure. There was minimal transmission of wildtype virus in vaccinated birds. The findings from this study further demonstrate the suitability of ΔgG ILTV for use as a live attenuated vaccine. Knowledge of the basic reproduction ratio of ILTV will be valuable for future studies that aim to improve disease control using vaccination programs.  aPublisher supplied data 3achickens 3aGallid alphaherpesvirus 1 3areproduction 3aflocks 3arespiratory tract diseases 3avaccines 3adisease control 3avaccination 3adisease outbreaks 3aviruses 3avirulent strains 3afield experimentation 3avirulence 3aglycoproteins 3alatent period 0aGallid herpesvirus 11 aHartley, Carol A.1 aGilkerson, James R.1 aCoppo, Mauricio J.C.1 aVaz, Paola1 aNoormohammadi, Amir H.1 aWells, Ben1 aRubite, Ambrosio1 aDhand, Navneet K.1 aBrowning, Glenn F.0 tVaccine.g2011 Aug. 5, v. 29, no. 34 p.5699-5704dElsevier Ltdx0264-410X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2011.06.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02190naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245010500171300001400276520102100290592002801311650001601339650002201355650001501377650001201392650001301404650003301417650001701450650001001467700001901477700001801496700002201514700002401536700001601560700001701576773008301593856008401676990002301760852000901783655001201792IND60103834820221117004823.0141106e20120701xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010383482DNAL7 a10.1016/j.matlet.2012.03.0562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIqbal, M.

The structural, chemical, and physical characteristics were investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD), field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), and Raman microspectroscopy. FESEM results exhibited the distinct clinopinacoid morphology with the apparent size of 10~14μm. The XRD results indicated that the clinopinacoid-like structure is comprised of the tetragonal phase SnO with the average crystal size of about 27nm. Two Raman modes at A₁g=210cm⁻¹ and B₁g=114cm⁻¹ had further testified the existence of the nano tetragonal phase SnO.

Surface redox properties of the catalyst were assessed using a series of temperature-programmed reduction (CO, H₂ and mixed) experiments, as well as operando infrared spectroscopy. It was demonstrated that CO and H₂ react at identical surface sites, with CO₂ formation proceeding simultaneously via three distinct Cuⁿ ⁺–CO carbonyl species. The origin of high catalytic selectivity towards CO at below 150°C stems from the carbonyl stabilization effect on the catalyst surface, preventing adsorption and subsequent oxidation of H₂. Under non-selective conditions at higher temperatures, a gradual red-shift and loss of intensity in the carbonyl peak was observed, indicating reduction of Cu⁺ to Cu⁰, and the onset of an alternate redox-type oxidation mechanism where CO and H₂ compete for the oxidation sites. These results for Cu–CeO₂ suggest that improved low-temperature catalytic activity will only be achieved at the expense of reduced high-temperature selectivity and vice versa.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactive sites 3aadsorption 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbon monoxide 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3acerium 3achemical reduction 3acopper 3ahydrogen 3ainfrared spectroscopy 3aoxidation 3apyrolysis 3aredox potential 3asurfaces 3atemperature1 aFerri, Davide1 aHug, Paul1 aScott, Jason1 aTeoh, Wey Yang1 aAmal, Rose0 tJournal of catalysis.g2011 Jan. 3, v. 277, no. 1 p.64-71dElsevier Inc.x0021-95177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcat.2010.10.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02849naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001900152245014100171300001600312520163900328592002801967650002301995650002402018650001402042650001202056650001102068650001302079650001302092650001302105650001102118700002202129700001502151700002202166700002102188700002302209773010102232856008602333990002302419852000902442655001202451IND60102488320221117192358.0141106e20130905xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010248832DNAL7 a10.1016/j.molstruc.2013.05.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKlaeboe, Peter10aRaman and infrared spectra, quantum chemical calculations, conformations and spectral assignments of 1-chloro-1-methyl-1-silacyclohexane  ap. 282-291.  aA 1,1-disubstituted silacyclohexane, 1-chloro-1-methyl-1-silacyclohexane, C₅H₁₀SiClCH₃, was synthesized and studied by infrared and Raman spectroscopy. The infrared spectra of the vapor and liquid were recorded at ambient temperature and the solid sample investigated at 78K. Negligible spectral changes ocurred at 78K compared with the fluid state, but after annealing to ca. 165K an apparent crystal was formed. Raman spectra of the liquid were recorded at 293K and depolarization data obtained. Additional Raman spectra were recorded at various temperatures between 293 and 143K. A supercooled liquid appeared after slow cooling, but an amorphous solid phase was observed after shock freezing to 78K. After annealing, a plastic phase was observed and an anisotropic crystal appeared after further annealing. In the crystalline phase spectral shifts and some vanishing bands were observed and only the a (Cl) conformer remained. The compound exists in two conformers, equatorial (Cl) (e) and axial (Cl)(a) in the liquid, amorphous and plastic phases, but only the a-conformer was present in the crystal. The experimental results suggest that the a-conformer has 1.5±0.5kJmol⁻¹ lower enthalpy than e in the liquid. B3LYP calculations with various basis sets and the G3 model chemistry gave conformational energy difference ΔE (a–e) in the range 3.2–2.4kJmol⁻¹. Infrared and Raman intensities, polarization ratios and vibrational frequencies for the two conformers were calculated. The 32A′ and 25A″ modes for the e(Cl) and a(Cl) conformations were assigned, supported by anharmonic B3LYP/cc-pVTZ calculations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRaman spectroscopy 3aambient temperature 3aannealing 3acooling 3aenergy 3aenthalpy 3afreezing 3aplastics 3avapors1 aNielsen, Claus J.1 aHorn, Anne1 aGuirgis, Gamil A.1 aOverby, Jason S.1 aAleksa, Valdemaras0 tJournal of molecular structure.g2013 Sept. 5, v. 1047 p.282-291dElsevier B.V.x0022-28607nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.molstruc.2013.05.0033Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01842naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245007800168300001600246520095000262592002801212650001701240650001101257650000801268650001101276700002001287700002201307773009801329856008101427990002301508852000901531655001201540IND60108509920221121064209.0141108e20110720xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010850992DNAL7 a10.1016/j.snb.2011.01.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIizuka, Kazuyuki10aGrowth of tin oxide thick films by plasma spray physical vapor deposition  ap. 551-556.  aTin oxide thick films were deposited by plasma spray physical vapor deposition at various oxygen flow rates and raw powder feeding rates. The films are fundamentally porous and the deposition rates reach 60μm/min at highest under the present condition. Local structures are however modified with the deposition condition. For example, relatively uniform columnar structure formed at high oxygen flow rate, whereas granular grains were observed when no oxygen gas was introduced. In contrast, granulate films were deposited at high powder feeding rate while rather uniform columnar films formed at low feeding rate. The gas sensors fabricated with these PS-PVD films have exhibited high sensitivity against formaldehyde gas at concentration as low as 100 ppb, which characterizes the sensors prepared by the PS-PVD method. Such sensitivities are found to change with the film microstructures that are in turn controlled by the PS-PVD conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aformaldehyde 3aoxygen 3atin 3avapors1 aKambara, Makoto1 aYoshida, Toyonobu0 tSensors and actuators.g2011 July 20, v. 155, no. 2 p.551-556dElsevier B.V.x0925-40057nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.snb.2011.01.0063Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01625naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245007100166300001600237520076500253592002801018650002701046650000901073650001501082650001101097700001201108773010201120856008101222990002301303852000901326655001201335IND60108433420221119212531.0141108e20130115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010843342DNAL7 a10.1016/j.sna.2012.09.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXing, ZengPing10aInvestigation of low frequency giant magnetoelectric torque effect  ap. 182-186.  aThe giant magnetoelectric (ME) effect induced by the coupling of piezoelectricity and magnetic torque in piezo-bimorph/magnet composites has been investigated.

There have been several mathematical models proposed to explain the observed behavior, as well. A different approach is taken here in which the bone is treated from a macroscopic view point. In this investigation, a one-dimensional analytical model is used to shed light on the factors which play the greatest role in modeling or growth of cortical bone at the periosteal surface. It is presumed that bone growth is promoted when increased amounts of bone nutrients, such as nitric oxide synthase (NOS) or messenger molecules, such as prostaglandin E₂ (PGE₂), seep out to the periosteal surface of cortical bone and are absorbed by osteoblasts. The transport of the bone nutrients is assumed to be a strain controlled process. Equations for the flux of these nutrients are written for a one-dimensional model of a long bone. The obtained partial differential equation is linearized and solved analytically. Based upon the seepage of nutrients out of the bone, the effect of loading frequency, number of cycles and strain level is examined for several experiments that were found in the literature. It is seen that bone nutrient seepage is greatest on the tensile side of the bone; this location coincides with the greatest amount of bone modeling.  aPublisher supplied data 3aequations 3amathematical models 3anitric oxide synthase 3anutrients 3aosteoblasts 3aprostaglandins 3aseepage1 aStähle, P.q(Per),1 aSvensson, Ingrid1 aEliaz, Noam0 tMathematical biosciences.g2011 Mar., v. 230, no. 1 p.37-44dElsevier Inc.x0025-55647nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.mbs.2010.12.0083Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03229naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245009200171300001600263520193600279592002802215650003102243650001202274650001002286650002402296650001502320650001902335650001502354650001302369650003002382650004502412650000902457650003502466650001702501650003202518700001702550700002102567773010302588856008402691990002302775852000902798655001202807IND60104455820221116174005.0141107e201109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010445582DNAL7 a10.1016/j.micinf.2011.04.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBen-Selma, Walid10aAssociation of TNF-α and IL-10 polymorphisms with tuberculosis in Tunisian populations  ap. 837-843.  aCytokine Th1/Th2 balance is known to play a key role in controlling Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection. Based upon the functional role of the TNF-α [−308 Gˡᵒʷ → Aʰⁱᵍʰ (rs1800629)] and IL-10 [−1082 Aˡᵒʷ → Gʰⁱᵍʰ (rs1800870), −819 Tˡᵒʷ → Cʰⁱᵍʰ (rs1800871) and −592 Aˡᵒʷ → Cʰⁱᵍʰ (rs1800872)] single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on production levels, we genotyped 76 patients with pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) (pTB), 55 patients with extrapulmonary TB (epTB) and 95 healthy blood donors by polymerase chain reaction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP). We observed that −308 A allele was associated with increased risk susceptibility to epTB (OR = 1.96; 95% CI, 1.04–3.71; P = 0.024). The −1082 AG genotype was significantly associated with increased risk development of epTB (odds ratio [OR] = 3.69; 95% confidence intervals [CI], 1.73–7.92; P corrected for the number of genotypes [Pc] = 0.0003). By contrast, −1082 AA genotype appeared to be associated with resistance to pTB (OR = 0.38; 95% CI, 0.19–0.74; Pc = 0.006) and epTB (OR = 0.22; 95% CI, 0.1–0.48; Pc = 0.00006). High-producer IL-10 GCC haplotype seemed to be associated with 2.11-fold (95% CI, 1.28–3.46; Pc = 0.003) and 2.57-fold (95% CI, 1.5–4.4; Pc = 0.0006) increased susceptibility to pTB and epTB, respectively. Combination of TNF-α/IL-10 high producer genotypes was associated with increased 3.13-fold (95% CI, 1.23–8.05; Pc = 0.028) susceptibility to epTB. However, combined TNF-α/IL-10 low producer genotypes appeared to have protect effect to pTB (OR = 0.44, 95% CI, 0.21–0.89; Pc = 0.04) and epTB (OR = 0.26, 95% CI, 0.1–0.62; Pc = 0.0028). Collectively, our results showed that analysed SNPs in the TNF-α and IL-10 gene polymorphisms play key role in susceptibility to or protection against TB development in Tunisian populations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMycobacterium tuberculosis 3aalleles 3ablood 3aconfidence interval 3ahaplotypes 3ainterleukin-10 3aodds ratio 3apatients 3apolymerase chain reaction 3arestriction fragment length polymorphism 3arisk 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 3atuberculosis 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha1 aHarizi, Hedi1 aBoukadida, Jalel0 tMicrobes and Infection.g2011 Sept., v. 13, no. 10 p.837-843dElsevier Masson SASx1286-45797nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.micinf.2011.04.0093Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03057naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245010100166300001600267520169600283592002801979650001602007650001302023650003502036650001102071650001202082650002202094650001302116650001102129650002002140650001702160650000902177650000902186650001402195650001402209650001102223650001102234650001402245650001202259650001102271650001602282650000902298700001602307700001602323700001602339773007002355856008202425990002302507852000902530655001202539IND60102828320221119001213.0141106e201306  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010282832DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fuel.2013.02.0492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGazulla, M.F.10aDevelopment of a WD-XRF analysis method of minor and trace elements in liquid petroleum products  ap. 247-253.  aThis paper describes a methodology for the analysis of minor and trace elements in liquid petroleum products, with varying oxygen content between 0% w/w and 3.4% w/w and varying C/H ratio between 7 and 9, by wavelength-dispersive X-ray fluorescence (WD-XRF) spectrometry, necessary to determine the properties that indicate the function and performance of the product in service. There are a number of standard methods of chemical analysis by WD-XRF, atomic absorption spectrophotometry (AAS) or inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-OES) that apply to one type of petroleum product. However, there is not a standard that applies to any kind of liquid petroleum products in a huge range of concentrations with low detection limits and uncertainties, that allow to control a great number of products in a huge range of concentrations of an elevate number of elements. In order to obtained a rapid an accurate methodology that allows the analysis of different materials in a huge range of concentrations, a WD-XRF method of measuring a set of elements: Al, Ba, Ca, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mg, Mn, Ni, P, Pb, S, Si, Ti, V and Zn, in a series of liquid petroleum products was developed being fine-tuned by optimising the measurement conditions and calculating the detection and quantification limits. The validation was carried out by using a series of reference materials and the uncertainty of the method was calculated. The analysis of sulphur was also performed by elemental analysis in addition to WD-XRF and the results obtained by both techniques were compared. The matrix of the different samples analysed and the standards used was also analysed by determining C, H, N and O.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-radiation 3aaluminum 3aatomic absorption spectrometry 3abarium 3acalcium 3achemical analysis 3achromium 3acopper 3adetection limit 3afluorescence 3airon 3alead 3amagnesium 3amanganese 3anickel 3aoxygen 3apetroleum 3asilicon 3asulfur 3auncertainty 3azinc1 aOrduña, M.1 aVicente, S.1 aRodrigo, M.0 tFuel.g2013 June, v. 108 p.247-253dElsevier Ltdx0016-23617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fuel.2013.02.0493Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03718naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100002000166245012700186300001600313520172000329592002802049650002102077650002202098650001802120650002302138650002402161650002002185650001202205650001402217650001502231650001202246650001802258650001902276650001402295650004002309650006002349650001802409650001402427650002102441650002702462650003302489650005402522650002202576650002402598650001602622650004702638650002502685650005402710650002602764700002602790700002502816700001602841700001702857700002402874773010402898856008103002852000903083655001203092IND60102081120221122005029.0141106e20110617xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010208112DNAL7 a215305382pmid7 a10.1016/j.jmb.2011.04.0332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFung, Angela W.13aAn Alternative Mechanism for the Catalysis of Peptide Bond Formation by L/F Transferase: Substrate Binding and Orientation  ap. 617-629.  aEubacterial leucyl/phenylalanyl tRNA protein transferase (L/F transferase) catalyzes the transfer of a leucine or a phenylalanine from an aminoacyl-tRNA to the N-terminus of a protein substrate. This N-terminal addition of an amino acid is analogous to that of peptide synthesis by ribosomes. A previously proposed catalytic mechanism for Escherichia coli L/F transferase identified the conserved aspartate 186 (D186) and glutamine 188 (Q188) as key catalytic residues. We have reassessed the role of D186 and Q188 by investigating the enzymatic reactions and kinetics of enzymes possessing mutations to these active-site residues. Additionally three other amino acids proposed to be involved in aminoacyl-tRNA substrate binding are investigated for comparison. By quantitatively measuring product formation using a quantitative matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry-based assay, our results clearly demonstrate that, despite significant reduction in enzymatic activity as a result of different point mutations introduced into the active site of L/F transferase, the formation of product is still observed upon extended incubations. Our kinetic data and existing X-ray crystal structures result in a proposal that the critical roles of D186 and Q188, like the other amino acids in the active site, are for substrate binding and orientation and do not directly participate in the chemistry of peptide bond formation. Overall, we propose that L/F transferase does not directly participate in the chemistry of peptide bond formation but catalyzes the reaction by binding and orientating the substrates for reaction in an analogous mechanism that has been described for ribosomes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aX-ray diffraction 3aaspartic acid 3acatalytic activity 3aenzymatic reactions 3aenzyme activity 3aenzymes 3aglutamine 3aionization 3aleucine 3aphenylalanine 3apoint mutation 3aribosomes 2aAmino Acidsxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aAminoacyltransferasesxchemistryxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aBinding Sites 2aCatalysis 2aCatalytic Domain 2aCrystallography, X-Ray 2aEscherichia colixenzymology 2aEscherichia coli Proteinsxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aModels, Molecular 2aMolecular Structure 2aMutagenesis 2aPeptidesxchemistryxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aProtein Conformation 2aRNA, Transfer, Amino Acylxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aSubstrate Specificity1 aEbhardt, H.

Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) analogues are licensed for treatment of type 2 diabetes, yet little data exist on efficacy and safety in liver injury. We aimed to assess the safety and efficacy of 26 weeks' liraglutide on liver function compared with an active placebo. METHODS: Individual patient data meta-analysis was done with patient level data combined from six 26-week, phase 3, double-blind randomised controlled trials on type 2 diabetes, which comprise the Liraglutide Effect and Action in Diabetes (LEAD) programme. In addition, the LEAD-2 sub-study was analysed to assess the effect on CT-measured hepatic steatosis. FINDINGS: Of 4442 patients analysed, 2241 (50·8%) had an abnormal alanine aminotransferase (ALT) at baseline (mean 33·8 IU/L [SD 14·9] in female participants; 47·3 [18·3] in male participants). Liraglutide 1·8 mg reduced ALT in these patients compared with placebo (−8·20 vs −5·01 IU/L, p=0·003), and was dose dependent (no significant differences vs placebo with liraglutide 0·6 or 1·2 mg). This effect was lost after adjustment for liraglutide's effect on reduction of weight (corrected mean ALT difference vs placebo −1·41 IU/L, p=0·21) and HbA1c (corrected mean ALT difference vs placebo 0·57 IU/L, p=0·63). Adverse effects with 1·8 mg liraglutide were similar between patients with and without baseline abnormal ALT. In the LEAD-2 sub-study, liraglutide 1·8 mg (26 weeks) improved hepatic steatosis (CT-measured liver:spleen attenuation ratio) from baseline (0·10, p=0·001) and showed a trend towards improvement compared with placebo (0.10 vs 0·00, p=0·07). INTERPRETATION: 26 weeks of liraglutide (1·8 mg) is safe, well tolerated, and improves liver enzymes compared with placebo in patients with type 2 diabetes.

The enzyme-functionalized MSN were fabricated by simultaneous coimmobilization of HRP and the carcinoembryonic antigen antibody (anti-CEA) onto the surface of MSN using 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane (APTES) as the linkage. Because the large surface area of MSN carriers increased the amount of HRP bound per sandwiched immunoreaction, the conjugates provided a much higher signal and increased sensitivity. This is an improvement over the traditional sandwich immunoassay which often has one or two enzyme molecules per antibody. This approach was successfully demonstrated as a simple, cost-effective, specific, and potent method to detect CEA in practical samples. The analysis showed a linear response within the range of 0.1–40ng/mL (r=0.9912). The relative standard deviation (RSD) for 11 parallel measurements of 20ng/mL CEA was 3.9%. The sensitivity of the immunosensor using MSN–HRP–Ab2 as labels was about 10-fold higher than that of traditional labels. These labels for immunosensors may provide many potential applications for detection of different biomolecules.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantigens 3achemiluminescence 3achemiluminescence immunoassays 3acost effectiveness 3aimmunosensors 3ananoparticles 3aperoxidase 3asilica 3asurface area1 aZhang, Zhujun1 aZhang, Ping1 aZhang, Xiaoming1 aFu, Aihua0 tSensors and actuators.g2011 July 20, v. 155, no. 2 p.557-561dElsevier B.V.x0925-40057nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.snb.2011.01.0073Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02429naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245016600167300001400333520121400347592002801561650001501589650003101604650002201635650001401657650001401671650001501685650002401700650001401724650001101738650001801749650001001767650002501777650002001802700002001822773010701842856008501949852000902034655001202043IND60101319220221120175431.0141106e20110315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010131922DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhazmat.2011.01.0572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZiylan, Asu14aThe occurrence and fate of anti-inflammatory and analgesic pharmaceuticals in sewage and fresh water: Treatability by conventional and non-conventional processes  ap. 24-36.  aThe presence of pharmaceutical (PhAC) residues in the environment is an emerging issue due to their continuous and uncontrolled release (via excretion from medical care) to the water environment and detrimental effects on aquatic organisms at low concentrations. A large fraction of PhAC pollution in water is composed of anti-inflammatory (AI) and analgesic (AN) drugs, which are rapidly excreted in urine. The present review is aimed to emphasize the occurrence of AI/AN wastes in sewage and fresh water bodies, their impacts on non-target organisms, and conversion or elimination by chemical, biochemical and physical treatment methods. The first part of the study is devoted to a critical review of most common AI/AN drugs and the relative efficiency of some selected sewage and drinking water treatment operations for their elimination/separation from aqueous systems. The second part focuses on pilot- or lab-scale applications of various advanced oxidation processes that are promising solutions to the ultimate degradation and/or conversion of such medical residues in effluents of drinking water treatment plants (DWTPs) and wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) to less harmful and non-toxic products.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanalgesics 3aanti-inflammatory activity 3aaquatic organisms 3aeffluents 3aexcretion 3afreshwater 3anontarget organisms 3aoxidation 3asewage 3asurface water 3aurine 3awastewater treatment 3awater pollution1 aInce, Nilsun H.0 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2011 Mar. 15, v. 187, no. 1-3 p.24-36dElsevier B.V.x0304-38947nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2011.01.0573Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02217naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245011700169300001600286520122100302592002801523650003101551650002001582650001701602650002501619650000701644650001701651650002401668700001401692700001501706773007601721856008501797852000901882655001201891IND60109207320221122231139.0141109e20120815xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010920732DNAL7 a10.1016/j.talanta.2012.05.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Yanhong10aMicrococcal nuclease detection based on peptide-bridged energy transfer between quantum dots and dye-labeled DNA  ap. 533-538.  aA novel and simple method was presented for micrococcal nuclease (MNase) detection based on fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) realized by electrostatic interaction. In this study, mercaptoacetic acid capped quantum dots (MAA-QDs) and ROX-modified single-stranded DNA (ROX-ssDNA) were chosen as energy donor and acceptor, respectively. At slightly basic pH, the positively charged peptide served as a bridge to bring negatively charged QDs and negatively charged ROX-ssDNA into close contact to energy transfer. When the ROX-ssDNA was cleaved into small fragments by MNase, the relatively weak electrostatic interaction between the fragmented ssDNA chains and the QDs/peptide complex should make the ROX away from the QDs/peptide complex, and thus the FRET efficiency decreased. Consequently, the fluorescence intensity of acceptor decreased and a quantification of the MNase was enabled. Under the optimal conditions, experimental results showed that the fluorescence intensity of acceptor was proportional to the logarithm of MNase concentration in a range of 4.0×10⁻³–8.0×10⁻²UmL⁻¹. The proposed approach offered adequate sensitivity for the detection of the MNase at 2.9×10⁻³UmL⁻¹.  aPublisher supplied data 3aelectrostatic interactions 3aenergy transfer 3afluorescence 3amicrococcal nuclease 3apH 3aquantum dots 3asingle-stranded DNA1 aWang, Lei1 aJiang, Wei0 tTalanta.g2012 Aug. 15, v. 97 p.533-538dElsevier B.V.x0039-91407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.talanta.2012.05.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02528naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245020200165300001600367520129600383592002801679650002401707650002201731650001101753650001101764650002401775650001901799650001801818650001301836650002501849650004401874650001901918700002101937773011701958856008202075852000902157655001202166IND60100676720221120185000.0141105e20110415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010067672DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcis.2011.01.0222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aInoue, Tohru10aMicelle formation of nonionic surfactants in a room temperature ionic liquid, 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate: Surfactant chain length dependence of the critical micelle concentration  ap. 798-802.  aMicellization behavior was investigated for polyoxyethylene-type nonionic surfactants with varying chain length (CₙEₘ) in a room temperature ionic liquid, 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate (bmimBF₄). Critical micelle concentration (cmc) was determined from the variation of ¹H NMR chemical shift with the surfactant concentration. The logarithmic value of cmc decreased linearly with the number of carbon atoms in the surfactant hydrocarbon chain, similarly to the case observed in aqueous surfactant solutions. However, the slope of the straight line is much smaller in bmimBF₄ than in aqueous solution. Thermodynamic parameters for micelle formation estimated from the temperature dependence of cmc showed that the micellization in bmimBF₄ is an entropy-driven process around room temperature. This behavior is also similar to the case in aqueous solution. However, the magnitude of the entropic contribution to the overall micellization free energy in bmimBF₄ is much smaller compared with that in aqueous solution. These results suggest that the micellization in bmimBF₄ proceeds through a mechanism similar to the hydrophobic interaction in aqueous surfactant solutions, although the solvophobic effect in bmimBF₄ is much weaker than the hydrophobic effect.  aPublisher supplied data 3aambient temperature 3aaqueous solutions 3acarbon 3aenergy 3ahydrophobic bonding 3ahydrophobicity 3aionic liquids 3amicelles 3anonionic surfactants 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3athermodynamics1 aYamakawa, Haruka0 tJournal of colloid and interface science.g2011 Apr. 15, v. 356, no. 2 p.798-802dElsevier Inc.x0021-97977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2011.01.0223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02106naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245018200168300001400350520088800364592002801252650002301280650001401303650002301317650001301340650001901353650001701372650001101389650001701400650001401417700002501431700002201456700002201478700001601500700001901516773009401535856008201629852000901711655001201720IND60100234620221120032005.0141105e20110103xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010023462DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcat.2010.10.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLanari, Daniela10aNew zirconium hydrogen phosphate alkyl and/or aryl phosphonates with high surface area as heterogeneous Brønsted acid catalysts for aza-Diels–Alder reaction in aqueous medium  ap. 80-87.  aNew zirconium hydrogen phosphate alkyl and/or aryl phosphonates of general formula Zr(PO₃OH)₂₋₍ ₓ ₊ y ₎(PO₃R)ₓ(PO₃R¹)y have been prepared as amorphous solids.

The Brønsted acid catalytic activity of the solids was tested on the direct aza-Diels–Alder reaction of 2-cyclohexen-1-one with N-PMP-pCl-benzaldimine in aqueous medium. The hydrophobic groups on the solid catalyst surface favor reagents’ diffusion toward the acidic sites, aiding proton transfer to reagents, increasing the catalytic activity of the prepared solids compared with the layered α-zirconium hydrogen phosphate (α-ZrP).  aPublisher supplied data 3aaromatic compounds 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3ahydrogen 3ahydrophobicity 3aphosphonates 3asolids 3asurface area 3azirconium1 aMontanari, Francesca1 aMarmottini, Fabio1 aPiermatti, Oriana1 aOrrù, Mara1 aVaccaro, Luigi0 tJournal of catalysis.g2011 Jan. 3, v. 277, no. 1 p.80-87dElsevier Inc.x0021-95177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcat.2010.10.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01516naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002500147245010000172300001400272520059900286592002800885650002400913650001400937650001700951700002700968700002200995773009601017856008101113990002301194852000901217655001201226IND60104150220221120150813.0141107e201103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010415022DNAL7 a10.1016/j.mbs.2011.01.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 ad’Onofrio, Alberto12aA generalization of Gompertz law compatible with the Gyllenberg–Webb theory for tumour growth  ap. 45-54.  aWe present a new extension of Gompertz law for tumour growth and anti-tumour therapy.

The vibrational frequencies were calculated for most stable conformer and were compared with the experimental frequencies, which yield good agreement between observed and calculated frequencies. The infrared and Raman spectra have also been predicted from the calculated intensities. ¹H and ¹³C NMR spectra were recorded and ¹H and ¹³C nuclear magnetic resonance chemical shifts of the molecule were calculated using the gauge independent atomic orbital (GIAO) method. UV–Visible spectrum of the compound was recorded in the region 200–400nm and the electronic properties HOMO and LUMO energies were measured by time-dependent TD-DFT approach. Nonlinear optical and thermodynamic properties were interpreted. All the calculated results were compared with the available experimental data of the title molecule.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aRaman spectroscopy 3abenzoic acids 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aspectral analysis1 aSundaraganesan, N.1 aKarabacak, M.1 aTanrıverdi, O.1 aKurt, M.0 tJournal of molecular structure.g2012 Sept. 26, v. 1024 p.1-12dElsevier B.V.x0022-28607nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.molstruc.2012.05.0083Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01362naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245011100172300001800283520030600301592002800607650001100635650001100646650002300657650002300680650001100703650001100714650001300725650001400738700002500752700002500777700002100802773009600823856008400919852000901003655001201012IND60109760820221122143624.0141109e20110518xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010976082DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tetlet.2011.03.0222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aReddy, B.V.

S21.  aBACKGROUND: Successful hepatocyte isolation is crucial for development of cellular transplantation and biochemical research. Most researchers isolate hepatocytes from surplus donor tissue or normal tissue removed during resection of liver tumours. However, most tissue available for research is from explanted diseased liver and donor tissue rejected for transplant. We previously described our experience of hepatocyte isolation using liberase from such livers with a success rate of 51% and median viability of 40%. Liberase is a highly purified collagenase that has been shown to improve the viability of isolated porcine hepatocytes. N-acetylcysteine (NAC) has been shown to improve the viability of human hepatocytes isolated from steatotic donor tissue. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of both reagents in combination on the outcome of hepatocyte isolation from normal and diseased liver. METHODS: Hepatocytes were isolated from 30 consecutive liver specimens as previously described (old protocol). A further 30 consecutive liver specimens were perfused with buffer containing NAC and standard collagenase substituted by liberase (new protocol). Success was defined as maintenance of cell adhesion and morphology for 48 h and/or their successful use in laboratory studies. Mann-Whitney tests were used to compare results. Fisher's exact test was used for categorical data. FINDINGS: Baseline factors were similar for both groups. The delay to tissue processing was slightly less in the new protocol group (median 2 h vs 4 h, p=0·007). The success rate improved from 40% (12/30) with the old protocol to 70% (21/30) with the new protocol (p=0·037), and the median viable cell yield increased from 7·3 × 10⁴ to 28·3 × 10⁴ cells per g tissue (p=0·003). After multivariable analysis adjusting for the difference in time delay, the success rate (p=0·014) and viable cell yield per g tissue (p=0·001) remained significantly improved. INTERPRETATION: NAC and liberase greatly improve the success of hepatocyte isolation and result in a significantly higher viable cell yield. Use of these agents may improve the availability of hepatocytes for transplantation as well as laboratory research.

The charged droplets are formed by liquid nitrogen assisted sample spray through a stainless steel nebulizer and transported into mass analyzer for the identification of multiply charged protein ions. The effects of acids and modifier volumes for the efficient ionization of the above analytes in LNASI MS were carefully investigated. Multiply charged proteins and amino acid clusters were effectively identified by LNASI MS. The present approach can effectively detect the multiply charged states of cytochrome c at 400nM. A comparison between LNASI and ESI, CSI, SSI and V-EASI methods on instrumental conditions, applied temperature and observed charge states for the multiply charged proteins, shows that the LNASI method produces the good quality spectra of amino acid clusters at ambient conditions without applied any electric field and heat. To date, we believe that the LNASI method is the most simple, low cost and provided an alternative paradigm for production of multiply charged ions by LNASI MS, just as ESI-like ions yet no need for applying any electrical field and it could be operated at low temperature for generation of highly charged protein/peptide ions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacids 3aangiotensin II 3aarginine 3acytochrome c 3adroplets 3aelectric field 3aglutathione 3aheat 3ainsulin 3aionization 3aions 3alactalbumin 3amass spectrometry 3amyoglobin 3anitrogen 3astainless steel 3atemperature 3aubiquitin 3avalinomycin1 aHasan, Nazim1 aWu, Hui-Fen0 tTalanta.g2012 Aug. 15, v. 97 p.539-549dElsevier B.V.x0039-91407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.talanta.2012.05.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02539naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100002100188245009900209300001600308520142200324592002801746650001501774650001401789650003101803650002401834650001301858650000901871650002001880700001901900700001301919700002201932773009801954856008102052990002302133852000902156655001202165IND60104150320221120140158.0141107e201104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010415032DNAL7 a10.1016/j.mbs.2011.02.0042doi7 aPMC30702992pmcid7 a213297042pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLayton, Anita T.10aFeedback-mediated dynamics in a model of coupled nephrons with compliant thick ascending limbs  ap. 115-127.  aThe tubuloglomerular feedback (TGF) system in the kidney, a key regulator of glomerular filtration rate, has been shown in physiologic experiments in rats to mediate oscillations in thick ascending limb (TAL) tubular fluid pressure, flow, and NaCl concentration. In spontaneously hypertensive rats, TGF-mediated flow oscillations may be highly irregular. We conducted a bifurcation analysis of a mathematical model of nephrons that are coupled through their TGF systems; the TALs of these nephrons are assumed to have compliant tubular walls. A characteristic equation was derived for a model of two coupled nephrons. Analysis of that characteristic equation has revealed a number of parameter regions having the potential for differing stable dynamic states. Numerical solutions of the full equations for two model nephrons exhibit a variety of behaviors in these regions. Also, model results suggest that the stability of the TGF system is reduced by the compliance of TAL walls and by internephron coupling; as a result, the likelihood of the emergence of sustained oscillations in tubular fluid pressure and flow is increased. Based on information provided by the characteristic equation, we identified parameters with which the model predicts irregular tubular flow oscillations that exhibit a degree of complexity that may help explain the emergence of irregular oscillations in spontaneously hypertensive rats.  aPublisher supplied data 3acompliance 3aequations 3aglomerular filtration rate 3amathematical models 3anephrons 3arats 3asodium chloride1 aBowen, Matthew1 aWen, Amy1 aLayton, Harold E.0 tMathematical biosciences.g2011 Apr., v. 230, no. 2 p.115-127dElsevier Inc.x0025-55647nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.mbs.2011.02.0043Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02253naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245015900168300001600327520098600343592002801329650002201357650002201379650003701401650000901438650001101447650003301458650001601491650002401507650003701531650001001568700001401578700001801592700001801610700001801628773009301646856008401739990002301823852000901846655001201855IND60103762720221122045716.0141106e20120115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010376272DNAL7 a10.1016/j.matlet.2011.09.0802doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Lingyun14aThe production of flower-like NiFe₂O₄ superstructures consisting of nanosheets via the thermolysis of a heterometallic oxo-centered trinuclear complex  ap. 311-314.  aFlower-like NiFe₂O₄ superstructures consisting of nanosheets have been successfully synthesized by direct thermolysis of a heterometallic oxo-centered trinuclear complex [NiFe₂O(CH₃COO)₆(H₂O)₃·2H₂O] (NiFe-HOTC) at 400°C for 6h in a horizontal tube furnace. The composition and structure of the products were investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and infrared spectra (IR). XRD analysis revealed a pure ferrite phase with high crystallinity. Morphological investigation by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) showed NiFe₂O₄ flowers with average diameter varying from 0.5 to 3μm consist of nanosheets with average edge length in the range of 60–300nm and thickness of about 30nm. Furthermore, energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDX) demonstrated that the atom ration of Ni, Fe and O is 1:2:4.

The vertically arranged domains are formed by the action of capillarity, the oriented nanofibrils are induced by the crystallization nucleation of P3HT and the directional evaporation of the solvent, and the flat-on conformation of P3HT chains are induced by the enhanced intermolecular interaction of the alkyl side chains in CS₂ atmosphere. The arrangement behavior of P3HT crystals and chains facilitate the bridging chains link neighboring grains with minimal distortion, while the enhanced intermolecular interaction enable the formation of larger P3HT crystals, and then reduce the quantity of grain boundary. As a result, this ordered structure provides more delocalized electrons along the direction that perpendicular to the substrate, which would result in an improvement of the carrier mobility along this direction.  aPublisher supplied data 3aannealing 3acapillarity 3acarbon disulfide 3acrystallization 3acrystals 3aelectrons 3aevaporation 3apolymers1 aSun, Yue1 aZheng, Lidong1 aGeng, Yanhou1 aHan, Yanchun0 tPolymer.g2013 Jan. 8, v. 54, no. 1 p.423-430dElsevier Ltdx0032-38617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.polymer.2012.11.0113Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02793naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002400148245011500172300001400287520145100301592002801752650002301780650000901803650001201812650001401824650002401838650001001862650001801872650002801890650001401918650002401932650001001956650001301966650001801979650001401997700002002011700001802031700002002049700001402069700002202083773011602105856008202221990002302303852000902326655001202335IND60102989720221118050506.0141106e20130325xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010298972DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jpba.2012.11.0462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBloomfield, Matthew10aNon-invasive identification of incoming raw pharmaceutical materials using Spatially Offset Raman Spectroscopy  ap. 65-69.  aA new approach to verification of incoming raw materials through packaging in pharmaceutical manufacturing is proposed and demonstrated. The method is based around Spatially Offset Raman Spectroscopy (SORS) and permits a rapid chemical identity analysis of incoming materials to satisfy regulatory requirements but without the need to open the packaging. This dramatically increases the throughput of incoming raw materials into the pharmaceutical manufacturing chain and eliminates the need for a chemically safe sampling environment required for invasive inspection methods. Since the inspection is non-invasive the safety of the operators is ensured and the integrity of inspected material is not compromised by preventing exposure to the ambient atmosphere and cross contamination. The experiments presented here demonstrate the ability to accurately identify common pharmaceutical materials, typically in under 10s acquisition time, through a range of frequently used packaging, including translucent plastic and paper sacks and coloured glass bottles, which can be challenging for conventional Raman spectroscopy as well as other optical spectroscopy methods. With the exception of metallic containers and cardboard drums all the tested packaging materials proved to be amenable to this technique. This demonstrates the viability of this new rapid verification method for non-invasive materials identification in pharmaceutical manufacture.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRaman spectroscopy 3abags 3abottles 3acardboard 3across contamination 3aglass 3amanufacturing 3amaterial identification 3apackaging 3apackaging materials 3apaper 3aplastics 3araw materials 3aviability1 aAndrews, Darren1 aLoeffen, Paul1 aTombling, Craig1 aYork, Tim1 aMatoušek, Pavel,0 tJournal of pharmaceutical and biomedical analysis.g2013 Mar. 25, v. 76 p.65-69dElsevier B.V.x0731-70857nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jpba.2012.11.0463Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02822naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245010400170300001600274500001500290520124200305592002801547650001901575650001501594650002101609650001501630650001101645650001301656650001301669650001401682650004801696650001601744650001401760650002601774650002001800650001901820650001401839650003001853653001801883700002301901700002401924700002001948700002001968700002101988700002002009700002202029700002502051700002102076773009302097856008102190852000902271655001202280IND60103524720221122074036.0141106e20111121xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010352472DNAL7 a10.1016/j.lfs.2011.09.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTabolacci, Claudio10aAloe-emodin as antiproliferative and differentiating agent on human U937 monoblastic leukemia cells  ap. 812-820.  a2019-12-04  aAIMS: Aloe-emodin (AE), a plant derived anthraquinone, has been shown to have anticancer activity in various human cancer cell lines. We have recently reported that AE possesses a differentiative potential on melanoma cells. The purpose of this study was to investigate the possible modulation of defined markers of monocytic differentiation of AE on human U937 cell line. MAIN METHODS: U937 cells differentiation has been confirmed unequivocally by Griess and nitroblue tetrazolium reduction assays, protoporphyrin IX accumulation, expression of CD14 and CD11b surface antigens, phagocytic activity, migration and attachment ability. The effect on polyamine metabolism, apoptosis and cytokine production was also investigated. KEY FINDINGS: We showed that AE-treated U937 cells exhibit a noticeably rise in transglutaminase activity. This enhanced enzyme activity correlates with AE-induced growth arrest and differentiation to functionally mature monocytes. SIGNIFICANCE: Taken together, the results reported here show that AE can promote the macrophage differentiation of U937 cells, suggesting that this anthraquinone could be a potential candidate as a differentiation-inducing selective agent for therapeutic treatment of leukemia.  aPublisher supplied data 3aprotoporphyrin 3apolyamines 3asurface antigens 3ametabolism 3ahumans 3aleukemia 3amelanoma 3amonocytes 3aprotein-glutamine gamma-glutamyltransferase 3amacrophages 3acytokines 3anitroblue tetrazolium 3aenzyme activity 3aanthraquinones 3aapoptosis 3aanticarcinogenic activity 0agrowth arrest1 aOliverio, Serafina1 aLentini, Alessandro1 aRossi, Stefania1 aGalbiati, Alice1 aMontesano, Carla1 aMattioli, Palma1 aProvenzano, Bruno1 aFacchiano, Francesco1 aBeninati, Simone0 tLife sciences.g2011 Nov. 21, v. 89, no. 21-22 p.812-820dElsevier Inc.x0024-32057nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lfs.2011.09.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02414naa a2200289 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001600145245013600161300001600297520145500313592002801768650001501796650002101811650002701832650001401859650001901873700001601892700001901908773012801927856004802055852000902103655001202112IND4505561720221120192940.0150617e201203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND450556172DNAL7 a10.1007/s00477-011-0534-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTong, Juxiu10aAssimilating transient groundwater flow data via a localized ensemble Kalman filter to calibrate a heterogeneous conductivity field  ap. 467-478.  aA localized ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) method is developed to assimilate transient flow data to calibrate a heterogeneous conductivity field. To update conductivity value at a point in a study domain, instead of assimilating all the measurements in the study domain, only limited measurement data in an area around the point are used for the conductivity updating in the localized EnKF method. The localized EnKF is proposed to solve the problems of the filter divergence usually existing in a data assimilation method without localization. The developed method is applied, in a synthetical two dimensional case, to calibrate a heterogeneous conductivity field by assimilating transient hydraulic head data. The simulations by the data assimilation with and without localized EnKF are compared. The study results indicate that the hydraulic conductivity field can be updated efficiently by the localized EnKF, while it cannot be by the EnKF. The covariance inflation and localization are found to solve the problem of the filter divergence efficiently. In comparison with the EnKF method without localization, the localized EnKF method needs smaller ensemble size to achieve stabilized results. The simulation results by the localized EnKF method are much more sensitive to conductivity correlation length than to the localization radius. The developed localized EnKF method provides an approach to improve EnKF method in conductivity calibration.  aPublisher supplied data 3acovariance 3agroundwater flow 3ahydraulic conductivity 3ainflation 3atransient flow1 aHu, Bill X.1 aYang, Jinzhong0 tStochastic environmental research and risk assessment.g2012 Mar., v. 26, no. 3 p.467-478dSpringer-Verlagx1436-32407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00477-011-0534-0  aDNAL 7aarticle01922naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094024002200134024001900156040001800175100001800193245013700211300001800348520073200366592002801098650001301126650001101139650001301150650001301163650001201176650001201188650002501200650001301225650001201238650001301250650001101263651001001274700001801284773009201302856008601394990002301480852000901503655001201512IND60111571420221120122454.0141109e201209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011157142DNAL7 a10.1016/j.worlddev.2012.04.0292doi7 aPMC46553232pmcid7 a266091932pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHannum, Emily10aPoverty and Proximate Barriers to Learning: Vision Deficiencies, Vision Correction and Educational Outcomes in Rural Northwest China  ap. 1921-1931.  aUncorrected vision may present a significant barrier to educational mobility in poor communities in low and middle income countries.

These bacteriocins permeabilize the membrane of sensitive bacteria, causing loss of ions and dissipation of the membrane potential. Most circular bacteriocins probably adopt a common 3D structure consisting of four or five α-helices encompassing a hydrophobic core.

Both pro-proliferative as well as anti-proliferative and non-proliferative activities have been reported using high dosage of EPO. Systemic administration of high doses of this cytokine is a clinical concern due to risk of thrombosis. Herein, we applied EPO in low dosages and investigated whether it can stimulate liver regeneration after liver resection. MAIN METHODS: Parameters of liver regeneration were assessed 3days after 70% hepatectomy by means of immunochemistry and proteomics. EPO was given twice in low dosages (200 and 600IU/kg BW). KEY FINDINGS: We showed that EPO facilitated hepatic regeneration in rats. Enhanced hepatocyte proliferation (Ki67, BrdU-positive cells) was observed in all EPO-treated groups. By performing Differential Proteomic analysis, we identified two proteins which resulted sensitive to EPO treatment after hepatectomy: Peroxiredoxin-1 and glutathione S-transferase Mu 1. SIGNIFICANCE: Based on our results, low doses of rhEPO increase the hepatic regenerative capacity after partial hepatectomy in rats by enhancing hepatocyte proliferation and acting on antioxidant enzymes. Both proteins identified by proteomic analysis have not previously been associated with liver regeneration and will aid in the understanding of EPO's regenerative response having clinical implications to treat liver failure.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantioxidants 3aerythropoietin 3aglutathione transferase 3aimmunochemistry 3aliver 3aliver failure 3aliver regeneration 3aproteomics 3arats 3aresection 3athrombosis1 aPavlica, Sanja1 aDeiwick, Andrea1 aLotkova, Halka1 aKucera, Otto1 aDarsow, Kai1 aBartel, Sebastian1 aSchulze, Mattes1 aLange, Harald A.1 aCervinkova, Zuzana0 tLife sciences.g2011 Dec. 5, v. 89, no. 23-24 p.827-833dElsevier Inc.x0024-32057nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lfs.2011.08.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01716naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245014700167300001600314520073800330592002801068650002201096650001301118650001601131650003301147700001501180700001801195773008501213856008401298990002301382852000901405655001201414IND60103922120221116212206.0141107e20130201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010392212DNAL7 a10.1016/j.matlet.2012.10.0382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Jingjing12aA simple method for the preparation of Bi₂WO₆-reduced graphene oxide with enhanced photocatalytic activity under visible light irradiation  ap. 126-128.  aReduced graphene oxide/Bi₂WO₆ (RGO–Bi₂WO₆) composite photocatalysts were prepared by a simple one-pot method.

These effects can range from simple irritation of the skin and eyes to more severe effects such as affecting the nervous system, the reproductive system and cancer. The molecular mechanisms underlying such effects are still under investigation.Epigenetics is the study of heritable changes in gene expression that occur without a change in the DNA sequence. Several epigenetic mechanisms, including DNA methylation, histone modifications and microRNA expression, can be triggered by environmental factors. We review current evidences indicating that epigenetic modifications may mediate pesticide effects on human health.In vitro, animal, and human investigations have identified several classes of pesticides that modify epigenetic marks, including endocrine disruptors, persistent organic pollutants, arsenic, several herbicides and insecticides.Several investigations have examined the effects of environmental exposures and epigenetic markers, and identified toxicants that modify epigenetic states. These modifications are similar to the ones found in pathological tissue samples. In spite of the current limitations, available evidence supports the concept that epigenetics holds substantial potential for furthering our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of pesticides health effects, as well as for predicting health-related risks due to conditions of environmental exposure and individual susceptibility.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aDNA methylation 3aarsenic 3aendocrine-disrupting chemicals 3aenvironmental exposure 3aenvironmental factors 3aepigenetics 3aeyes 3agene expression regulation 3aherbicides 3ahistones 3ahuman health 3ahumans 3ainsecticides 3amicroRNA 3anucleotide sequences 3apersistent organic pollutants 3aprediction 3areproductive system 3arisk 3askin irritation 3atoxic substances 3atoxicology 0aEpigenetics 0aDNA methylation 0aHistone modifications 0aMicroRNA expression 0aPesticide exposures1 aBertazzi, P.A.1 aBollati, V.0 tToxicology.g2013 May 10, v. 307 p.35-41dElsevier Ireland Ltdx0300-483X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tox.2013.01.0173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04017naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001600148245018600164300001900350520211100369592002802480650002102508650000802529650001102537650002502548650001202573650000902585650002202594650003802616650002102654650001502675650002502690650002002715650001102735650001502746650001902761650001902780650002502799650001802824650001102842650001002853650001302863650002002876650002002896650004302916650005202959650001103011650002403022650001603046700001103062700001503073700002303088700002303111700002103134773012203155856008203277990002303359852000903382655001203391IND60100164720221120144204.0141105e201109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010016472DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jaci.2011.04.0322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, MinChao10aCold temperature induces mucin hypersecretion from normal human bronchial epithelial cells in vitro through a transient receptor potential melastatin 8 (TRPM8)–mediated mechanism  ap. 626-634.e5.  aBACKGROUND: Cold air stimulus is a major environmental factor that exacerbates chronic inflammatory airway diseases, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and asthma. At the molecular level, cold is detected by transient receptor potential melastatin 8 (TRPM8). To date, TRPM8 expression has not been characterized in the airway epithelium of patients with COPD. The role of TRPM8 channels in a series of airway responses induced by cold stimuli and the molecular and biochemical pathways of TRPM8 in regulating cold-induced responses are largely unknown. OBJECTIVE: We sought to explore the role of TRPM8 in cold air–provoked mucus hypersecretion and the potential signaling pathway involved in this process. METHODS: The expression of TRPM8 in the bronchial epithelium was examined by means of immunohistochemistry, RT-PCR, and Western blotting. TRPM8 receptor function and hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) were characterized by means of Ca²⁺ imaging and spatiotemporal dynamics of phospholipase C (PLC) δ1–pleckstrin homology–green fluorescent protein, respectively. The expression of MUC5AC mRNA and MUC5AC mucin protein was measured by using real-time PCR and ELISA, respectively. Four serine residues in the myristoylated alanine-rich C kinase substrate (MARCKS)–phosphorylation site domain were mutated to identify the function of MARCKS in TRPM8-mediated airway mucus hypersecretion. RESULTS: TRPM8 protein and mRNA expression were significantly increased in patients with COPD compared with expression seen in healthy subjects. Cold produced robust increases in intracellular Ca²⁺ levels and promoted translocation of PLCδ1–pleckstrin homology–green fluorescent protein. Cold increased expression of MUC5AC mRNA and intracellular and secreted MUC5AC protein in a nonsustained way. Phosphorylation site domain–mutant MARCKS cDNA hindered MUC5AC secretion induced by cold. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that the TRPM8 receptor is involved in cold-induced mucus hypersecretion through the Ca²⁺-PLC-PIP2-MARCKS signaling pathway.  aPublisher supplied data 3aWestern blotting 3aair 3aasthma 3abiochemical pathways 3acalcium 3acold 3acomplementary DNA 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3aepithelial cells 3aepithelium 3afluorescent proteins 3agene expression 3ahumans 3ahydrolysis 3ahypersecretion 3aimage analysis 3aimmunohistochemistry 3amessenger RNA 3amucins 3amucus 3apatients 3aphospholipase C 3aphosphorylation 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3aserine 3asignal transduction 3atemperature1 aLi, Qi1 aYang, Gang1 aKolosov, Victor P.1 aPerelman, Juliy M.1 aZhou, Xiang Dong0 tThe Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology.g2011 Sept., v. 128, no. 3 p.626-634.e5dMosby, Inc.x0091-67497nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jaci.2011.04.0323Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02156naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002500148245005800173300001600231520090900247592002801156650000801184650002201192650003101214650001001245650002001255650001601275650001201291650003601303650002401339650002201363650001201385700002201397700002601419700002201445700002701467700002001494700002701514773010201541856008201643852000901725655001201734IND60110709520221119140230.0141109e201106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011070952DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tibs.2011.03.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBowzard, J. Bradford10aPAMPer and tRIGer: ligand-induced activation of RIG-I  ap. 314-319.  aRetinoic-acid-inducible gene-I (RIG-I) is an important component of the innate immune response to many RNA viruses that limits viral replication until adaptive immunity becomes available to clear the infection. Upon binding to the nucleic acid genomes and replication intermediates of these viruses, RIG-I undergoes a complex activation process that involves post-translational modifications and structural rearrangements. Once activated, RIG-I upregulates well-studied signal transduction pathways that lead to the production of type-I interferons (IFNs) and a large variety of antiviral IFN-stimulated genes. Thus, an effective antiviral response is dependent on the interaction between pathogen-derived ligands and RIG-I. Recent work has begun to clarify the required characteristics of RIG-I activators and is setting the stage for the identification of authentic ligands used during viral infection.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRNA 3aadaptive immunity 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3ainnate immunity 3ainterferons 3aligands 3apost-translational modification 3asignal transduction 3avirus replication 3aviruses1 aDavis, William G.1 aJeisy-Scott, Victoria1 aJha, Priyaranjan,1 aGangappa, Shivaprakash1 aFujita, Takashi1 aSambhara, Suryaprakash0 tTrends in biochemical sciences.g2011 June, v. 36, no. 6 p.314-319dElsevier Ltdx0968-00047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tibs.2011.03.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01746naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245008900166300001600255520074800271592002801019650002201047650002201069650002401091650001601115650001601131700001401147700001401161700001801175700001401193773008501207856008401292990002301376852000901399655001201408IND60103922220221116212144.0141107e20130201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010392222DNAL7 a10.1016/j.matlet.2012.11.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Haibo10axBaTiO₃–(1−x)BiFeO₃ strained epitaxial thin film with enhanced magnetization  ap. 427-429.  aStrained epitaxial xBaTiO₃–(1−x)BiFeO₃ (x=0–0.2) thin films were grown on STO (001) substrate by radio frequency magnetron sputtering.

METHODS: A mixed (vapor/liquid) phase exposure system was used to model the in vivo reactivity of inhaled HDI vapor with GSH in the airway fluid. HDI–GSH reaction products, and their capacity to transfer HDI to human albumin, were characterized through mass spectrometry and serologic assays, using HDI-specific polyclonal rabbit serum. RESULTS: HDI vapor exposure of 10mM GSH solutions resulted in primarily S-linked, bis(GSH)–HDI reaction products. In contrast, lower GSH concentrations (100μM) resulted in mainly mono(GSH)–HDI conjugates, with varying degrees of HDI hydrolysis, dimerization and/or intra-molecular cyclization, depending upon the presence/absence of H₂PO₄ ⁻/HPO₄ ²⁻ and Na⁺/Cl⁻ ions. The ion composition and GSH concentration of the fluid phase, during HDI vapor exposure, strongly influenced the transfer of HDI from GSH to albumin, as did the pH and duration of the carbamoylating reaction. When carbamoylation was performed overnight at pH 7, 25 of albumin’s lysines were identified as potential sites of conjugation with partially hydrolyzed HDI. When carbamoylation was performed at pH 9, more rapid (within 3h) and extensive modification was observed, including additional lysine sites, intra-molecular cross-linkage with HDI, and novel HDI–GSH conjugation. CONCLUSIONS: The data define potential mechanisms by which the levels of GSH, H₂PO₄ ⁻/HPO₄ ²⁻, and/or other ions (e.g. H⁺/OH⁻, Na⁺, Cl⁻) affect the reactivity of HDI vapor with self-molecules in solution (e.g. airway fluid), and thus, might influence the clinical response to HDI respiratory tract exposure.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalbumins 3aallergens 3aasthma 3ablood serum 3achlorides 3acrosslinking 3adimerization 3aglutathione 3ahumans 3ahydrolysis 3aions 3alysine 3amass spectrometry 3apH 3apathogenesis 3aprotons 3arabbits 3arespiratory system 3asodium 3avapors1 aMhike, Morgen1 aHettick, Justin M.1 aLiu, Jian1 aSiegel, Paul D.0 tToxicology in vitro.g2013 Mar., v. 27, no. 2 p.662-671dElsevier Ltdx0887-23337nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tiv.2012.11.0133Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03424naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002300148245012100171300001900292520204400311592002802355650001102383650001502394650001802409650002702427650001302454650001902467650003602486650003202522700001902554700002102573700001802594700002602612700003002638700001802668700002202686700002602708700002002734773012202754856008202876990002302958852000902981655001202990IND60100164820221120144220.0141105e201109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010016482DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jaci.2011.03.0452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGagliardo, Rosalia10aIκB kinase–driven nuclear factor-κB activation in patients with asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease  ap. 635-645.e2.  aBACKGROUND: Nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) is a transcriptional factor of different inflammatory patterns involved in asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) that is tightly controlled by IκB kinase (IKK) complex.

METHODS: We assessed IKKα and IKKβ expression and activation, their regulation by glucocorticosteroids, and their involvement in IL-8 synthesis in PBMCs isolated from asthmatic patients, healthy smokers (HSs), patients with COPD, and control subjects. PBMCs from control subjects were stimulated with TNF-α and cigarette smoke extract in the presence or absence of fluticasone propionate (FP), L-glutathione reduced, or both, and IKK activation and IL-8 release were evaluated. RESULTS: IKKα activity was higher in patients with COPD and HSs than in asthmatic patients and control subjects. IKKβ activity was higher in asthmatic patients, HSs, and patients with COPD than in control subjects. In vitro FP treatment induced inhibition of both IKKα and IKKβ activity in PBMCs from asthmatic patients, patients with COPD, and HSs, although IKKβ activity was more sensitive to FP than that of IKKα. FP reduced the IL-8 released from PBMCs of asthmatic patients, patients with COPD, and HSs, although IL-8 inhibition was higher in asthmatic patients than in patients with COPD and HSs. FP reduced IKKα and IKKβ activities in TNF-α and cigarette smoke extract–treated PBMCs, with higher levels of inhibition for IKKβ than IKKα activity. L-glutathione reduced improved the downregulatory effects of FP on IKKα and IL-8 levels. CONCLUSION: Based on differential activation of IKKα and IKKβ, our findings suggest a different profile in the upstream regulation of the IKK-driven NF-κB system in asthmatic patients and patients with COPD. These differences in the regulation of the inflammatory process may explain, at least in part, the different pharmacologic responses in these patients.  aPublisher supplied data 3aasthma 3acigarettes 3ainterleukin-8 3amononuclear leukocytes 3apatients 3apropionic acid 3atranscription factor NF-kappa B 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha1 aChanez, Pascal1 aProfita, Mirella1 aBonanno, Anna1 aAlbano, Giusy Daniela1 aMontalbano, Angela Marina1 aPompeo, Flora1 aGagliardo, Cesare1 aMerendino, Anna Maria1 aGjomarkaj, Mark0 tThe Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology.g2011 Sept., v. 128, no. 3 p.635-645.e2dMosby, Inc.x0091-67497nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jaci.2011.03.0453Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02415naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001400148245016000162300001400322520118700336592002801523650002201551650002001573650001701593650001601610650002001626650001201646650001501658650001801673650000701691650001501698650001301713700001601726700001501742700001801757700001301775700001201788773011401800856008201914852000901996655001202005IND60100869920221120055831.0141105e20130101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010086992DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcis.2012.09.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Jie12aA reusable naphthalimide-functionalized magnetic fluorescent nanosensor for the simultaneous determination and removal of trace Hg²⁺ in aqueous solution  ap. 46-52.  aOn the basis of high selective and sensitive interaction of 1,8-naphthalimide with Hg²⁺ and the formation of stable neutral imide-Hg-imide complexes, we designed and synthesized a novel magnetic fluorescent sensor (S1) employed Fe₃O₄ magnetic nanoparticles and 1,8-naphthalimide fluorescent sensor. Under optimum conditions, S1 exhibits the high selectivity toward Hg²⁺ over other metal ions, with the detection limit of 1.03×10⁻⁸M. We demonstrated that a reliable fluorescence response of S1 toward Hg²⁺ over a broad pH range (pH=5.0–9.0) could be reused at least four cycles. The maximum sorption capacity of S1 was about 5.6mgg⁻¹. In addition, the removal of Hg²⁺ in water was achieved by the aggregation-induced sedimentation (AIS) strategy. Moreover, the suspended magnetic nanoparticles could be removed by external magnetic field, and the secondary pollution was avoided. The above-mentioned results indicate that this approach may serve as a foundation of the preparation of the multifunctional magnetic fluorescent sensor for simple, rapid, and simultaneous determination and removal of trace Hg²⁺ and other pollutants in environmental samples.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaqueous solutions 3adetection limit 3afluorescence 3airon oxides 3amagnetic fields 3amercury 3ametal ions 3ananoparticles 3apH 3apollutants 3asorption1 aZhu, Baocun1 aYu, Haiqin1 aYan, Liangguo1 aWei, Qin1 aDu, Bin0 tJournal of colloid and interface science.g2013 Jan. 1, v. 389, no. 1 p.46-52dElsevier Inc.x0021-97977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2012.09.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02923naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003800135040001800173100002400191245012000215300001800335506007600353520127500429592002801704506003701732650002201769650003801791650002801829650001701857650001301874650003801887650002601925650001401951650001201965650001601977650002101993653000802014653001602022653001602038653001202054653001402066653001902080700002102099700002202120700002002142700001402162700001902176773010402195856008502299852000902384655001202393IND60669793820221207142929.0200809e20200115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066979382DNAL7 a322314002pmid7 aPMC71051402pmcid7 a10.1016/j.powtec.2019.09.0452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAtamanuk, Katherine10aAtomic force microscopy to identify dehydration temperatures for small volumes of active pharmaceutical ingredients  ap. 1271-1277.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe environmental conditions associated with changing the hydration state of active pharmaceutical ingredients (API) are crucial to understanding their stability, bioperformance, and manufacturability. Identifying the dehydration event using < 1 μg of material is an increasingly important challenge. Atomic Force Microscopy indentation mapping is implemented at controlled temperatures between 25 and 100 °C, for nanoscale volumes of hydrated APIs exhibiting distinct dehydration behavior and anhydrous APIs as controls. For caffeine hydrate and azithromycin dihydrate, the relative mechanical modulus increases ~10-fold at dehydration temperatures. These are confirmed by conventional macroscopic measurements including Variable Temperature Powder X-ray Diffraction, Thermogravimetric Analysis, and Differential Scanning Calorimetry. Conversely, no such mechanical transition is observed for anhydrous ibuprofen or a proprietary anhydrous compound. AFM-based mechanical mapping is therefore demonstrated for small-volume determination of temperature-induced solid-state dehydration events, which may enable spatial or temporal mapping for future studies of dehydration mechanisms and kinetics as a function of commercially relevant nanoscale heterogeneities.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aX-ray diffraction 3aactive pharmaceutical ingredients 3aatomic force microscopy 3aazithromycin 3acaffeine 3adifferential scanning calorimetry 3aenvironmental factors 3aibuprofen 3apowders 3atemperature 3athermogravimetry 0aAFM 0aIndentation 0aDehydration 0aHydrate 0aAnhydrous 0aPharmaceutical1 aThomas, Myles C.1 aWadams, Robert C.1 aLinthicum, Will1 aYu, Weili1 aHuey, Bryan D.0 tPowder technology.g2020 Jan. 15, v. 360 p.1271-1277dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11732x0032-59107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.powtec.2019.09.0453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03562naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245014800172300001400320520178700334592002802121650002102149650002202170650001102192650002502203650000902228650002102237650001902258650001802277650001502295650001402310650001702324650001602341650001602357650002702373650001002400653001002410653001202420653000702432653000902439653000802448653000802456653001102464653000702475653000802482653000802490653001502498653002002513653001702533653003102550653001602581653001602597700002102613700002902634700002302663700001902686773012502705856008502830852000902915655001202924IND60610410220221120222216.0190318e201809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061041022DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vetimm.2018.07.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMathew, Leanne M.10aResveratrol administration increases phagocytosis, decreases oxidative burst, and promotes pro-inflammatory cytokine production in healthy dogs  ap. 21-29.  aResveratrol is a polyphenol that is safe to administer to dogs and has immunomodulating properties. Canine in vitro work indicated that resveratrol spared polymorphonuclear cell (PMN) phagocytosis but reduced the robustness of PMN oxidative burst and resulted in a pro-inflammatory leukocyte cytokine profile. The objective of this study was to determine the short-term effect of resveratrol on the healthy canine innate immune system in vivo. The hypothesis was that resveratrol would spare phagocytosis, depress the vigor of PMN oxidative burst, and result in a proinflammatory stimulated leukocyte cytokine profile in vivo. In an open-label study, whole blood was collected from 12 healthy, adult client-owned dogs on day 0 and 3. Six dogs received resveratrol, 200 mg kg−1, orally once daily for three days and six dogs served as controls with no supplement administered. Phagocytosis, oxidative burst and pathogen associated molecular pathogen stimulated leukocyte production of tumor necrosis factor (TNF), interleukin (IL)-6, and IL-10 were measured. Results between days 0 and 3 were compared using two way repeated measures analysis of variance and Fisher least significant difference method. A P -value of < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Resveratrol administration resulted in an increased number of Escherichia coli phagocytized by PMNs and decreased robustness of the oxidative burst reaction. Resveratrol also increased stimulated TNF and IL-6 production with no effect on IL-10. Resveratrol had differential effects on peripheral innate immune system function in dogs. Studies of resveratrol including tissue compartments and the adaptive immune system are indicated to determine if these immunologic effects may be beneficial in disease states.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aadaptive immunity 3aadults 3aanalysis of variance 3adogs 3aimmunomodulators 3ainterleukin-10 3ainterleukin-6 3aleukocytes 3apathogens 3aphagocytosis 3apolyphenols 3aresveratrol 3atumor necrosis factors 3avigor 0aANOVA 0aE. coli 0aFL 0aiNOS 0aLTA 0aMFI 0aNF-κB 0aPG 0aPMA 0aTLR 0aImmunology 0aInnate immunity 0aPhagocytosis 0aPro-inflammatory cytokines 0aResveratrol 0aPhytophenol1 aWoode, Rowena A.1 aAxiak-Bechtel, Sandra M.1 aAmorim, Juliana R.1 aDeClue, Amy E.0 tVeterinary immunology and immunopathology.g2018 Sept., v. 203 p.21-29dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl31971x0165-24277nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetimm.2018.07.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02352naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002600145245014600171300002000317520108900337592002801426650002501454650001801479650001501497650002101512650001001533650001601543650002801559650001401587650001901601650001501620650003301635650002301668650002401691700002801715700002301743773010001766856007901866852000901945655001201954IND60350196220221118025115.0150812e201508  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6035019622DNAL7 a10.1111/1750-3841.129672doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChakraborty, Snehasis10aResponse Surface Optimization of Process Parameters and Fuzzy Analysis of Sensory Data of High Pressure–Temperature Treated Pineapple Puree  ap.

The target was to maximize the inactivation of polyphenoloxidase (PPO) along with a minimal loss in beneficial bromelain (BRM) activity, ascorbic acid (AA) content, antioxidant capacity, and color in the sample. The optimum condition was 600 MPa, 50 °C, and 13 min, having the highest desirability of 0.604, which resulted in 44% PPO and 47% BRM activities. However, 93% antioxidant activity and 85% AA were retained in optimized sample with a total color change (∆E*) value less than 2.5. A 10‐fold reduction in PPO activity was obtained at 600 MPa/70 °C/20 min; however, the thermal degradation of nutrients was severe at this condition. Fuzzy mathematical approach confirmed that sensory acceptance of the optimized sample was close to the fresh sample; whereas, the thermally pasteurized sample (treated at 0.1 MPa, 95 °C for 12 min) had the least sensory score as compared to others.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantioxidant activity 3aascorbic acid 3abromelains 3acatechol oxidase 3acolor 3afruit puree 3ahigh pressure treatment 3anutrients 3apasteurization 3apineapples 3aresponse surface methodology 3asensory evaluation 3athermal degradation1 aRao, Pavuluri Srinivasa1 aMishra, Hari Niwas0 tJournal of food science.g2015 Aug., v. 80, no. 8 p.E1763-E1775dThe Institutex0022-11477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1750-3841.129673Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02621naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245015400164300001600318520116300334592002801497650001901525650002501544650002201569650001601591650002001607650000901627650000901636650001201645650001501657650002001672650001101692650001101703650003001714653002501744653002401769653002501793653001401818653003001832653002001862700001601882700001701898700001601915700001401931773009201945856008102037852000902118655001202127IND60544779320221120183407.0160901e20150616xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054477932DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aca.2015.04.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGao, Xiaohui10aColorimetric detection of iron ions (III) based on the highly sensitive plasmonic response of the N-acetyl-l-cysteine-stabilized silver nanoparticles  ap. 118-125.  aWe report here a facile colorimetric sensor based on the N-acetyl-l-cysteine (NALC)-stabilized Ag nanoparticles (NALC–Ag NPs) for detection of Fe3+ ions in aqueous solution. The Ag NPs with an average diameter of 6.55±1.0nm are successfully synthesized through a simple method using sodium borohydride as reducing agent and N-acetyl-l-cysteine as protecting ligand. The synthesized silver nanoparticles show a strong surface plasmon resonance (SPR) around 400nm and the SPR intensity decreases with the increasing of Fe3+ concentration in aqueous solution. Based on the linear relationship between SPR intensity and concentration of Fe3+ ions, the as-synthesized water-soluble silver nanoparticles can be used for the sensitive and selective detection of Fe3+ ions in water with a linear range from 80nM to 80μM and a detection limit of 80nM. On the basis of the experimental results, a new detection mechanism of oxidation–reduction reaction between Ag NPs and Fe3+ ions is proposed, which is different from previously reported mechanisms. Moreover, the NALC–Ag NPs could be applied to the detection of Fe3+ ions in real environmental water samples.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetylcysteine 3aanalytical chemistry 3aaqueous solutions 3acolorimetry 3adetection limit 3aions 3airon 3aligands 3ananosilver 3areducing agents 3asilver 3asodium 3asurface plasmon resonance 0aColorimetric sensing 0aN-acetyl-l-cysteine 0aSilver nanoparticles 0aIron ions 0aSurface plasmon resonance 0aChemical sensor1 aLu, Yizhong1 aHe, Shuijian1 aLi, Xiaokun1 aChen, Wei0 tAnalytica chimica acta.g2015 June 16, v. 879 p.118-125dElsevier B.V.x0003-26707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aca.2015.04.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03519naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002800144245011900172300002000291520135800311592002801669596008301697596009401780596008501874596012301959596008902082596009602171596006902267650001902336650001302355650001402368650002102382653002002403653002502423653001602448653001602464700002102480700001902501700001602520700005802536700002602594700001802620700006102638700001902699700006502718773014202783856007902925852000903004655001203013IND60787771020221123024109.0220810e20220722xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078777102DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.2c066262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBelotcerkovtceva, Daria10aInsights and Implications of Intricate Surface Charge Transfer and sp³-Defects in Graphene/Metal Oxide Interfaces  ap. 36209-36216.  aAdherence of metal oxides to graphene is of fundamental significance to graphene nanoelectronic and spintronic interfaces. Titanium oxide and aluminum oxide are two widely used tunnel barriers in such devices, which offer optimum interface resistance and distinct interface conditions that govern transport parameters and device performance. Here, we reveal a fundamental difference in how these metal oxides interface with graphene through electrical transport measurements and Raman and photoelectron spectroscopies, combined with ab initio electronic structure calculations of such interfaces. While both oxide layers cause surface charge transfer induced p-type doping in graphene, in sharp contrast to TiOₓ, the AlOₓ/graphene interface shows the presence of appreciable sp³ defects. Electronic structure calculations disclose that significant p-type doping occurs due to a combination of sp³ bonds formed between C and O atoms at the interface and possible slightly off-stoichiometric defects of the aluminum oxide layer. Furthermore, the sp³ hybridization at the AlOₓ/graphene interface leads to distinct magnetic moments of unsaturated bonds, which not only explicates the widely observed low spin-lifetimes in AlOₓ barrier graphene spintronic devices but also suggests possibilities for new hybrid resistive switching and spin valves.  aPublisher supplied data  a101002772cH2020 European Research Councildhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100010663  aUPD2018-0003cUPD2019-0166 , Wenner-Gren Stiftelsernadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100014437  a201901326cSvenska Forskningsr?det Formasdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001862  a2132cG?ran Gustafssons Stiftelse f?r Naturvetenskaplig och Medicinsk Forskningdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100003426  a2000602cStiftelsen Olle Engkvist Byggm?staredhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100004200  a201603278,c2019-03666, and 2019-0 , Vetenskapsr?detdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100004359  a486981cEnergimyndighetendhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100004527 3aaluminum oxide 3agraphene 3amagnetism 3atitanium dioxide 0acharge transfer 0agraphene electronics 0aspintronics 0asp3-defects1 aMaciel, Renan P.1 aBerggren, Elin1 aMaddu, Ramu1 aSarkar, Tapati1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4754-25041 aKvashnin, Yaroslav O.1 aThonig, Danny1 aLindblad, Andreas1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9188-96041 aEriksson, Olle1 aKamalakar, M.

The impact of different grass–legume mixtures on the N contribution of the forage mixture has rarely been investigated under comparable soil and climatic conditions. We conducted a field experiment on a sandy soil at two nitrogen levels with seven two-species forage mixtures: alfalfa, bird's-foot trefoil, red clover, or white clover in mixture with perennial ryegrass, and white clover in mixture with meadow fescue, timothy, or hybrid ryegrass. We found high N₂-fixation of more than 300kgNha⁻¹ from both red clover and alfalfa even when the two mixtures received 300kgtotal-Nha⁻¹ in cattle slurry. The addition of cattle slurry N fertilizer lowered N₂-fixation for white clover and red clover as expected, but for bird's-foot trefoil and alfalfa no changes in the proportion of N derived from N₂-fixation was observed. We conclude that the competition for available soil N from perennial ryegrass in mixture was an important factor for the proportion of N in alfalfa, white clover, and bird's-foot trefoil obtained from N₂-fixation. White clover had a high proportion of N derived from atmosphere for all companion grasses despite significant differences in white clover proportion. Although the perennial ryegrass–alfalfa mixture in the grass phase yielded more than twice the N from N₂-fixation compared to white clover in the perennial ryegrass mixture, this did not in the following year lead to higher residual N effects of alfalfa. Both in terms of N yield in the grass phase and N yield in the subsequent spring barley red clover contributed most to the improvement of soil N fertility.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFestuca pratensis 3aLolium perenne 3aTrifolium pratense 3aTrifolium repens 3aalfalfa 3acattle manure 3aclimatic factors 3afield experimentation 3aforage 3aforage legumes 3agrasses 3ahybrids 3anitrogen 3anitrogen fertilizers 3asandy soils 3asoil fertility 3aspring barley1 aSøegaard, Karen1 aPirhofer-Walzl, Karin1 aEriksen, Jørgen0 tEuropean journal of agronomy.g2012 Jan., v. 36, no. 1 p.66-74dElsevier B.V.x1161-03017nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.eja.2011.09.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02522naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002000144245011500164300001600279520116900295592002801464650001501492650001301507650001601520650001301536650001301549650001001562650002601572650001901598650003101617650001301648650001301661650001501674650003301689650001101722650001601733650002301749650001401772650002101786650001001807650001701817700001901834700002101853700001701874773008301891856004501974852000902019655001202028IND50088960320140423000000.0140423e201405  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008896032DNAL7 a10.1002/star.2013001882doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMajzoobi, Mahsa10aEffects of malic acid and citric acid on the functional properties of native and cross‐linked wheat starches  ap. 491-495.  aThe functional properties of native and modified starches are affected by other food components such as organic acids. The objective of this study was to determine the effects of citric and malic acids as two common organic acids in foods on some properties of native and cross‐linked wheat starches. Acids (150 mg/kg starch basis) were added to a starch suspension (40% w/w) and held for 30 min at 25°C, neutralized, washed, dried, and sieved. Scanning electron microscopy showed that both acids caused some spots on the surface of the granules. The acids reduced intrinsic viscosity and water absorption, while increased water solubility of the samples. Determination of the thermal properties showed that malic acid significantly reduced the gelatinization temperature and enthalpy of gelatinization while citric acid had no significant effect on these parameters. Both acids decreased hardness, adhesiveness, elasticity, and cohesiveness of the starch gels. In general, malic acid was more effective than citric acid on the functional properties of both starches. Native wheat starch was more sensitive to these acids than the cross‐linked starches.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3aadhesion 3acitric acid 3acohesion 3aenthalpy 3afoods 3afunctional properties 3agelatinization 3agelatinization temperature 3agranules 3ahardness 3amalic acid 3ascanning electron microscopy 3astarch 3astarch gels 3athermal properties 3aviscosity 3awater solubility 3awheat 3awheat starch1 aBeparva, Paniz1 aFarahnaky, Asgar1 aBadii, Fojan0 tStärke =.g2014 May, v. 66, no. 5-6 p.491-495dVerlag Chemiex0038-90567nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/star.201300188  aDNAL 7aarticle03229naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245008100169300001300250520193200263592002802195650001402223650000902237650001202246650001602258650001602274650002402290650001302314650002202327650002602349650000902375650002402384651001402408651001602422651001302438651001202451700002802463700002302491700002002514700002102534700002802555773009802583856008102681852000902762655001202771IND60112365020221117014921.0141110e201201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011236502DNAL7 a10.1016/j.eja.2011.08.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLaborte, Alice G.10aRice yields and yield gaps in Southeast Asia: Past trends and future outlook  ap. 9-20.  aRice production must increase to meet future food requirements amid strong competition for limited resources. Yield gap analysis is a useful method to examine how large the ranges are between potential, desirable rice yields and those actually realized in farmers’ fields. We analyzed farmers’ yields in wet and dry seasons in four intensively cropped rice areas in Southeast Asia and explored opportunities for reducing the yield gap to meet future food requirements. We found yield gaps of 2.0–5.0tha⁻¹ between average and climatic yield potential and 1.2–2.6tha⁻¹ between average and best farmers’ yields. In relative terms, average yields varied between 43% and 75% of the climatic yield potential and 61% and 83% of the best farmers’ yields. Farmers with best yields were generally more educated, and used fertilizers and labor more efficiently than average farmers. The yield gaps between average and best farmers’ yields are higher in rice-importing countries (Indonesia and Philippines) compared with rice-exporting countries (Thailand and Vietnam). Assuming no change in diet, closing the existing yield gap between average and best-yielding farmers can sufficiently cover the yield increase needed for 2050 in the three countries, except for the Philippines, where yield increase must be even higher. Trend analysis of yield increases of a population of farmers in Central Luzon (Philippines), which included a learning curve analysis, well described the process of technology adoption from 1966 to 2008, leading to higher yields. Using this analysis, for the Philippines, we predicted yields to increase (from 2007/2008 to 2050) by only 18% with current cultivars, production technologies, and prevailing conditions. Therefore, structural changes are needed to boost farmers’ yields to close the yield gap faster. Investments in technology transfer and institutional arrangements are suggested.  aPublisher supplied data 3acultivars 3adiet 3afarmers 3afertilizers 3agrain yield 3ainnovation adoption 3alearning 3apopulation growth 3aprocessing technology 3arice 3atechnology transfer 3aIndonesia 3aPhilippines 3aThailand 3aVietnam1 ade Bie, Kees (C.A.J.M.)1 aSmaling, Eric M.A.1 aMoya, Piedad F.1 aBoling, Anita A.1 aVan Ittersum, Martin K.0 tEuropean journal of agronomy.g2012 Jan., v. 36, no. 1 p.9-20dElsevier B.V.x1161-03017nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.eja.2011.08.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03058naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100006500151245012200216300001400338520159500352592002801947650002001975650002401995650001302019650001502032650001002047650001202057650001702069650001902086650001402105650001602119650001202135650001302147650002202160650001602182651001102198653002502209653002402234653002102258653002702279653002602306700002202332700002602354773010102380856008602481852000902567655001202576IND60610410420221120233843.0190628e201812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061041042DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fishres.2018.07.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBabcock, Elizabeth A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2279-676210aFish community and single-species indicators provide evidence of unsustainable practices in a multi-gear reef fishery  ap. 70-85.  aUsing information on the species composition and length-frequencies of fish caught in the spear and hook and line fisheries of Glover’s Reef Marine Reserve, Belize, we evaluated changes between 2004–2010 and 2011–2017 in single-species and ecosystem sustainability indicators. The two gears differed in species caught, and both changed species composition between time periods, with the line fishers targeting smaller species, and the spear fishers responding to a parrotfish ban by catching more snappers and small groupers, as well as grey angels. Both gears caught smaller fish in 2011–2017 compared to 2004–2010, indicating overfishing. Species often caught immature were black grouper, Nassau grouper and mutton snapper with spears, and black snapper with lines. Most fish of other species were mature, but many were smaller than the optimal size for harvest. Fishing mortality rates were higher than natural mortality rates for most species in both gears in both time periods, whether calculated from average length or by length-based spawning potential ratio (LBSPR), implying that most populations were experiencing overfishing. Many species also had a low spawning potential ratio, implying a high probability that they were overfished. In general, many species were subject to unsustainable levels of fishing, and, according to the Froese indicators, some would benefit from size limits to protect immature individuals. These results are supported despite uncertainty in life history parameters for fishes in Belize, and differences between data poor assessment methods.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLutjanus analis 3aMycteroperca bonaci 3aScaridae 3aecosystems 3agears 3agrouper 3alife history 3aline fisheries 3amortality 3aoverfishing 3asnapper 3aspawning 3aspecies diversity 3auncertainty 3aBelize 0aCoral reef fisheries 0aData-poor fisheries 0aLength-frequency 0aOverfishing indicators 0aSpawning aggregations1 aTewfik, Alexander1 aBurns-Perez, Virginia0 tFisheries research.g2018 Dec., v. 208 p.70-85dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl33528x0165-78367nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fishres.2018.07.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03207naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094024002200128024001900150040001800169100001200187245008600199300001400285506007600299520165800375592002802033506003702061650001402098650001102112650001502123650001802138650002002156650002002176650001302196650002302209650001202232650001702244650001602261650002502277650001302302650002202315650002002337650001802357650002802375651001902403700002202422700002102444700002502465773011002490856008002600852000902680655001202689IND60625006720221207100554.0181206e201401  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062500672DNAL7 a10.1177/01457217135126822doi7 aPMC40838372pmcid7 a242488322pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHu, Jie12aA Family-Based Diabetes Intervention for Hispanic Adults and Their Family Members  ap. 48-59.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe purpose of this quasi-experimental, 1-group longitudinal study is to examine the effects of a family-based intervention program on diabetes self-management behaviors, A1C, other biomarkers, psychosocial factors, and health-related quality of life in Hispanics with diabetes. Adult patients with diabetes (n = 36) and family members (n = 37) were recruited from a community clinic in rural central North Carolina. Patients and family members attended an 8-week culturally tailored diabetes educational program taught in Spanish. Data were collected pre- and post-intervention for both patients and family members, with an additional data collection for patients 1 month post-intervention. Most patients and family members were female, and almost all were immigrants. A1C decreased by 4.9% on average among patients from pre-intervention to 1 month post-intervention. Patients showed significant improvements in systolic blood pressure, diabetes self-efficacy, diabetes knowledge, and physical and mental components of health-related quality of life. Higher levels of intake of healthy foods and performance of blood glucose tests and foot inspections were reported. Family members significantly lowered body mass index and improved diabetes knowledge from pre-intervention to immediately post-intervention. No significant changes in levels of physical activity were found among patients with diabetes or family members. Findings suggest that including family members in educational interventions may provide emotional and psychological support to patients with diabetes, help to develop healthy family behaviors, and promote diabetes self-management.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aHispanics 3aadults 3abiomarkers 3ablood glucose 3abody mass index 3adata collection 3adiabetes 3aeducation programs 3afemales 3ahealthy diet 3aimmigration 3alongitudinal studies 3apatients 3aphysical activity 3aquality of life 3aself-efficacy 3asystolic blood pressure 3aNorth Carolina1 aWallace, Debra C.1 aMcCoy, Thomas P.1 aAmirehsani, Karen A.0 tDiabetes educator.g2014 Jan., v. 40, no. 1 p.48-59dSAGE PublicationswJournal:jnl42983x1554-60637nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/01457217135126823Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02401naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245020000165300001600365520096300381592002801344650002501372650001201397650001401409650001601423650002001439650002001459650003601479650002201515650000901537650001801546650001101564650001901575650001901594650001301613653001501626653001701641653001201658653002101670700002401691700001501715700001901730773009201749856008101841852000901922655001201931IND60544779720221120193241.0160901e20150630xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054477972DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aca.2015.04.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGrinyte, Ruta10aApplication of photocatalytic cadmium sulfide nanoparticles to detection of enzymatic activities of glucose oxidase and glutathione reductase using oxidation of 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine  ap. 131-138.  aIt was found out that semiconductor CdS nanoparticles (NPs) are able to catalyze photooxidation of the well known chromogenic enzymatic substrate 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) by oxygen. The photocatalytical oxidation of TMB does not require hydrogen peroxide and its rate is directly proportional to the quantity of CdS NPs produced in situ through the interaction of Cd2+ and S2− ions in an aqueous medium. This phenomenon was applied to development of colorimetric sensitive assays for glucose oxidase and glutathione reductase based on enzymatic generation of CdS NPs acting as light-powered catalysts. Sensitivity of the developed chromogenic assays was of the same order of magnitude or even better than that of relevant fluorogenic assays. The present approach opens the possibility for the design of simple and sensitive colorimetric assays for a number of enzymes using inexpensive and available TMB as a universal chromogenic compound.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanalytical chemistry 3acadmium 3acatalysts 3acolorimetry 3aenzyme activity 3aglucose oxidase 3aglutathione-disulfide reductase 3ahydrogen peroxide 3aions 3ananoparticles 3aoxygen 3aphotooxidation 3asemiconductors 3asulfides 0aBiosensing 0aQuantum dots 0aGlucose 0aEnzyme catalysis1 aGarai-Ibabe, Gaizka1 aSaa, Laura1 aPavlov, Valeri0 tAnalytica chimica acta.g2015 June 30, v. 881 p.131-138dElsevier B.V.x0003-26707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aca.2015.04.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02992naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100002100166245008500187300001600272520155300288592002801841650002101869650002101890650002501911650001001936650001601946650001301962650002401975650002401999650002502023650001602048650002702064650002002091650001802111650002202129650002002151650001802171653000802189653002002197653002502217700002002242700001802262773014002280856008102420852000902501655001202510IND60651159220221119171958.0190711e201711  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065115922DNAL7 a282856062pmid7 a10.1017/S00296651170003132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aForsyth, Stewart14aThe importance of dietary DHA and ARA in early life: a public health perspective  ap. 568-573.  aAlthough the literature on the contribution of DHA and arachidonic acid (ARA) to fundamental metabolic functions in brain, immune and cardiovascular systems is extensive, there is a lack of consensus on the need for explicit recommendations on dietary intake for both DHA and ARA during the early years of life. This review takes a public health perspective with the objective of ensuring that recommendations protect the most vulnerable children worldwide. Most studies on the effects of DHA and ARA in early life have been undertaken in high-income countries and this is reflected in policy recommendations. Although breast milk is considered the gold standard and always contains DHA and ARA, there are proposals that infant formulas, especially follow-on formulas, do not need to be supplemented with these fatty acids. Complementary foods frequently have low concentrations of ARA and DHA and this is most significant in low-income countries where availability is also limited. Recent evidence shows that in developing countries, intakes of DHA and ARA during the age period 6–36 months are low and this relates to low national income. It is concluded that a continuum of DHA and ARA intake needs to be maintained during early life, a critical period of infant growth and development. For both infant and follow-on formulas, DHA and ARA should be mandatory at levels that are equivalent to breast milk. An optional recommendation may be limited to countries that can demonstrate evidence of adequate intakes of DHA and ARA during early life.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAdequate Intakes 3aarachidonic acid 3abiochemical pathways 3abrain 3abreast milk 3achildren 3acomplementary foods 3adeveloped countries 3adeveloping countries 3afood intake 3agrowth and development 3ainfant formulas 3ainfant growth 3aissues and policy 3anational income 3apublic health 0aDHA 0aDietary intakes 0aInfants and children1 aGautier, Sheila1 aSalem, Norman0 tProceedings of the Nutrition Society.g2017 Nov., v. 76, no. 4 p.568-573dCambridge University PresswJournal:jnl45480x1475-27197nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S00296651170003133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02144naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245006900169300001400238520112900252592002801381650000801409650002801417650001901445650003101464650001101495650001101506700001801517700002001535700001201555700001901567700002101586773009401607856008401701852000901785655001201794IND60112977520221121144740.0141111e20120713xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011297752DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chroma.2012.02.0262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChang, Tianjun10aSelective isolation of G-quadruplexes by affinity chromatography  ap. 62-68.  aG-quadruplex (G4) is a characteristic secondary structure of nucleic acids containing repetitive tandem guanines. G4-forming sequences are found prevalent in the human genome by bioinformatics analysis. Accumulating evidence has suggested that G4s are involved in many biological processes. Selective isolation of G4s would be an effective tool in the study of G4s. In this paper, we prepared four affinity matrixes using hemin or a perylene derivative (N,N′-Bis-(2-(amino)ethyl)-3,4,9,10-perylenetetracarboxylic acid diimide, Pery01) as ligand, and investigated the retention behaviors of different G4s on these matrixes. Our experimental results suggest that the π-π stacking interaction between ligand and G-tetrad plays a key role in the selective isolation of G4s, whereas the electrostatic interaction between DNA and matrix causes the nonspecific binding. One matrix prepared by immobilizing Pery01 on polyglycidylmethacrylate (PGMA) beads through an aminocaproic acid spacer exhibits good selectivity for parallel structure G4s and has been successfully used to directly isolate a spiked parallel G4 from plasma.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aaffinity chromatography 3abioinformatics 3aelectrostatic interactions 3agenome 3ahumans1 aLiu, Xiangjun1 aCheng, Xiaohong1 aQi, Cui1 aMei, Hongcheng1 aShangguan, Dihua0 tJournal of chromatography.g2012 July 13, v. 1246 p.62-68dElsevier B.V.x0021-96737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chroma.2012.02.0263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01957naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001400148245010700162300001400269520078300283592002801066650001501094650002501109650001301134650002401147653004901171653002801220653001301248653001801261653002501279653002701304700001801331700001701349700001501366773011001381856008301491852000901574655001201583IND60610410820221120222106.0190718e201808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061041082DNAL7 a10.1016/j.trac.2018.04.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Bin10aFrontiers in highly sensitive molecularly imprinted electrochemical sensors: Challenges and strategies  ap. 52-67.  aSensitivity is an important parameter of molecularly imprinted electrochemical sensors, and various methods have been extensively investigated to improve this parameter. This review focuses on recent reports about different methods that can enhance the sensitivity of these sensors. To a great extent, the sensitivity of the molecularly imprinted sensor is limited by the number of cavities formed in a molecularly imprinted polymer on an electrode after elution. To enhance sensitivity and fabricate sensing devices, researchers employ signal amplification by labels, amplification by functional materials doped in imprinted membranes, sensitive film amplification, and other methods.

It has been assumed that the invasive populations of this genus correspond to X. laevis and that they are derived from the subspecies that inhabits the Mediterranean Cape region of South Africa. In part, this is supported by the successful establishment of this species in several Mediterranean regions of the world. In Mediterranean Chile, Xenopus has invaded an area of about 21,000 km ², with scarce attention to genetic aspects underlying its invasion. Using mitochondrial DNA sequences we determined that Xenopus laevis laevis from the Cape region of South Africa is the subspecies that invaded Chile. The analysis indicated that the invaders have low genetic diversity (only two haplotypes, compared to 10 in two localities of their native range), and that probably the invasion in Chile occurred only once. Landscape genetics revealed that factors such as aridity and elevation have determined the spread of the species, both from the ecological and genetic points of view. Our results show that the invasion of the African clawed frog in Chile has been successful for at least 30 years, in spite of low genetic variability, few events of introduction, low propagule pressure, and bottlenecks in the founding population.  aPublisher supplied data 3aXenopus laevis 3afauna 3afrogs 3agenetic variation 3ahaplotypes 3ahybrids 3alandscapes 3amitochondrial DNA 3anucleotide sequences 3atropics 3aChile 3aSouth Africa 0abiological invasions 0amitochondrial DNA 0aXenopus laevis 0aChile1 aMendez, Marco A.1 aCattan, Pedro1 aJaksic, Fabián0 tStudies on neotropical fauna and environment.g2014 Jan. 2, v. 49, no. 1 p.50-60dTaylor & Francisx1744-51407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01650521.2014.9128653Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03759naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001700153245014600170300001800316520223000334592002802564650002802592650001102620650002202631650001902653650001702672650001902689650001802708650001402726650000902740650001802749650001102767650002002778650001402798650001802812650001702830653001802847653002702865653002202892653002102914653003702935653003102972700002103003700002303024773012103047856008803168852000903256655001203265IND60582287920221118152409.0181010e20180215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058228792DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2017.09.0952doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFrank, Simon10aFluorescence-based multi-parameter approach to characterize dynamics of organic carbon, faecal bacteria and particles at alpine karst springs  ap. 1446-1459.  aKarst springs, especially in alpine regions, are important for drinking water supply but also vulnerable to contamination, especially after rainfall events. This high variability of water quality requires rapid quantification of contamination parameters. Here, we used a fluorescence-based multi-parameter approach to characterize the dynamics of organic carbon, faecal bacteria, and particles at three alpine karst springs. We used excitation emission matrices (EEMs) to identify fluorescent dissolved organic material (FDOM). At the first system, peak A fluorescence and total organic carbon (TOC) were strongly correlated (Spearman's rs of 0.949), indicating that a large part of the organic matter is related to humic-like substances. Protein-like fluorescence and cultivation-based determination of coliform bacteria also had a significant correlation with rs=0.734, indicating that protein-like fluorescence is directly related to faecal pollution. At the second system, which has two spring outlets, the absolute values of all measured water-quality parameters were lower; there was a significant correlation between TOC and humic-like fluorescence (rs=0.588–0.689) but coliform bacteria and protein-like fluorescence at these two springs were not correlated. Additionally, there was a strong correlation (rs=0.571–0.647) between small particle fractions (1.0 and 2.0μm), a secondary turbidity peak and bacteria. At one of these springs, discharge was constant despite the reaction of all other parameters to the rainfall event. Our results demonstrated that i) all three springs showed fast and marked responses of all investigated water-quality parameters after rain events; ii) a constant discharge does not necessarily mean constant water quality; iii) at high contamination levels, protein-like fluorescence is a good indicator of bacterial contamination, while at low contamination levels no correlation between protein-like fluorescence and bacterial values was detected; and iv) a combination of fluorescence measurements and particle-size analysis is a promising approach for a rapid assessment of organic contamination, especially relative to time-consuming conventional bacterial determination methods.  aPublisher supplied data 3abacterial contamination 3acarbon 3acoliform bacteria 3adrinking water 3afluorescence 3aorganic matter 3aparticle size 3apollution 3arain 3arapid methods 3aspring 3asprings (water) 3aturbidity 3awater quality 3awater supply 0aWater quality 0aEvent-based monitoring 0aKarst groundwater 0aOrganic material 0aExcitation-emission matrix (EEM) 0aParticle-size distribution1 aGoeppert, Nadine1 aGoldscheider, Nico0 tScience of the total environment.g2018 Feb. 15, v. 615 p.1446-1459dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2017.09.0953Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02215naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001300147245007800160300001400238520102100252592002801273650001901301650001901320650001601339650002201355650001801377650002501395650001401420650001501434650001201449653003401461653001601495653002301511653001901534700001301553700001601566700001501582700001601597773009001613856008101703852000901784655001201793IND60544779920221120193025.0160901e20150616xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054477992DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aca.2015.04.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQi, Jing10aRapid baculovirus titration assay based on viable cell side scatter (SSC)  ap. 58-62.  aThe baculovirus expression system is one of the most powerful tools for the production of recombinant proteins on both laboratory and industrial scales. Multiplicity of infection (MOI) is the crucial parameter for efficient protein expression. To obtain an optimal MOI, it is important to determine titer of virus stock before protein production. Herein, we established a label-free, simple and rapid method for virus titration based on viable cell side scatter (SSC). Generally, the SSC of cells infected with a series of virus dilutions was measured by a flow cytometer at 48h post-infection, and the probability of infected cells at a given dilution was estimated. For each well with the infection probabilities between 0.20 and 0.80, the range of dilutions was chosen, and virus titer was determined with a statistical method. Log-scale comparison of the results between the SSC based method and a standard plaque assay showed a good correlation (R2=0.9853), suggesting the fine accuracy of this proposed method.  aPublisher supplied data 3acell viability 3aflow cytometry 3aprobability 3aprotein synthesis 3arapid methods 3arecombinant proteins 3atitration 3aviral load 3aviruses 0aBaculovirus expression system 0aVirus titer 0aSide scatter (SSC) 0aFlow cytometer1 aLiu, Tao1 aPan, Junjie1 aMiao, Peng1 aZhang, Chun0 tAnalytica chimica acta.g2015 June 16, v. 879 p.58-62dElsevier B.V.x0003-26707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aca.2015.04.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02856naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002100139245010500160300001600265520183000281592002802111650001202139650001202151650001502163650001602178650001202194650002302206650002302229650001102252650001502263650002202278650002202300700002202322773010102344856004002445852000902485655001202494IND50073780820221121095300.0140310e201403  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007378082DNAL7 a10.1111/rec.120672doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHill, Kathryn C.10aNative–Exotic Species Richness Relationships Across Spatial Scales in a Prairie Restoration Matrix  ap. 204-213.  aIn highly invaded ecosystems, restoration of native plant communities is dependent upon reducing exotic species relative to native species. Even so, in monitoring, the native–exotic species richness ratio has been shown to be scale‐dependent. Measurement at small spatial scales (<1 m²) can reveal a negative native–exotic richness relationship, where niche occupation may prevent invasion. Conversely, at larger scales, a positive correlation may exist, where environmental heterogeneity and equally favorable conditions may drive native–exotic relationships. Here, we compare slopes of native–exotic relationships across spatial scales in a prairie undergoing active restoration. The observed native–exotic richness ratios varied considerably over scales ranging from 1 to 1,000 m², emphasizing the importance of choosing a measurement scale that is most pertinent to the treatment and ecological mechanism used to evaluate restoration success. Our native–exotic richness slopes were positive over all scales, but lower than would be expected in a random community assembly, suggesting the influence of niche‐based competition. Correspondingly, our native–exotic cover slope was more negative than a null model; however, areas of frequent fire treatments showed a significant deviation from null only for richness, indicating that burning may enhance native–exotic competitive dynamics for number of species but not cover. The negative native–exotic cover relationships appear to be driven in this system mainly by exotic graminoids, across burn treatments and native functional groups, supporting the concept that frequent burning can alter the dominant competitive mechanism from coverage of these exotic grasses to an improved environment for germination and dispersal of more native species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPoaceae 3aburning 3aecosystems 3agermination 3agrasses 3aindigenous species 3aintroduced species 3amodels 3amonitoring 3aplant communities 3aspecies diversity1 aFischer, Dylan G.0 tRestoration ecology.g2014 Mar., v. 22, no. 2 p.204-213dWiley Periodicals, Incx1061-29717nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/rec.12067  aDNAL 7aarticle03958naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002400151245011700175506011700292506007600409520205500485592002802540506003702568650001802605650002302623650005202646650001802698650001302716650001802729650001102747650002202758650001302780650001302793650001502806650002402821650001302845651001002858653001702868653001902885653001502904653001302919653001302932653002302945653003002968653003302998653001503031700001803046700006403064700002503128700002003153700001803173773009403191856008603285852000903371655001203380IND60709553420221207132406.0220523e202009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070955342DNAL7 a10.1016/j.heliyon.2020.e048652doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAshik, Arafat Islam13aAn immunoinformatics study on the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 revealing potential epitopes as vaccine candidates  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe pandemic situation of SARS-CoV-2 infection has sparked global concern due to the disease COVID-19 caused by it. Since the first cluster of confirmed cases in China in December 2019, the infection has been reported across the continents and inflicted upon a substantial number of populations. This study is focused on immunoinformatics analyses of the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein (S protein) which is key for the viral attachment to human host cells. Computational analyses were carried out for the prediction of B-cell and T-cell (MHC class I and II) epitopes of S protein and the analyses were extended further for the prediction of their immunogenic properties. The interaction and binding affinity of T-cell epitopes with HLA-B7 were also investigated by molecular docking. Three distinct epitopes for vaccine design were predicted from the sequence of S protein. The potential B-cell epitope was KNHTSPDVDLG possessing the highest antigenicity score of 1.4039 among other B-cell epitopes. T-cell epitope for human MHC class I was VVVLSFELL with an antigenicity score of 1.0909 and binding ability to 29 MHC-I alleles. The predicted T-cell epitope for human MHC class II molecule was VVIGIVNNT with a corresponding 1.3063 antigenicity score, less digesting enzymes, and 7 MHC-II alleles binding ability. All these three peptides were predicted to be highly antigenic, non-allergenic, and non-toxic. Analyses of the physiochemical properties of these predicted epitopes indicate their stable nature for plausible vaccine design. Furthermore, molecular docking investigation between the MHC class-I epitopes and human HLA-B7 reflects the stable interaction with high affinity among them. The present study posits three potential epitopes of S protein of SARS-CoV-2 predicted by immunoinformatic methods based on their immunogenic properties and interactions with the host counterpart that can facilitate the development of vaccine against SARS-CoV-2. This study can act as the springboard for the future development of the COVID-19 vaccine.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aB-lymphocytes 3aCOVID-19 infection 3aSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 3aT-lymphocytes 3aepitopes 3aglycoproteins 3ahumans 3aimmunoinformatics 3apandemic 3apeptides 3aprediction 3avaccine development 3avaccines 3aChina 0aBiochemistry 0aBioinformatics 0aImmunology 0aVirology 0aCOVID-19 0aSpike glycoprotein 0aB-cell and T-cell epitope 0aEpitope-based vaccine design 0aSARS-CoV-21 aHasan, Mahedi1 aTasnim, Atiya Tahira1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7802-39481 aChowdhury, Md.

Ahles (Crassulaceae) and Minuaritia uniflora (Walt.) Matif. (Caryophyllaceae). These two species along with Viguiera porteri (A. Gray) Blake (Asteraceae) are dominant in island communities on granite outcrops in the southeastern United states. Actuarial life tables and survivorship curves were constructed for natural populations of both Sedum and Minuarita. On the basis of field studies the hypothesis was proposed that the population dynamics of dominant outcrop species are primarily influenced by interspecific competition for soil moisture in habitats of varying soil depth. This hypothesis was tested by growing both species under varying levels of soil moisture, soil depth, and competition in a programmed environment. Final verification of cause—and—effect relationships was obtained through experiments under modified field conditions. Strict zonation of Sedum smallii and Minuartia uniflora along intensity gradients of soil depth and soil moisture in the island communities is due to (1) high tolerance of Sedum to low moisture levels in soils less than 4 cm deep; (2) the competitive superiority of Minuartia over Sedum under more favorable moisture levels prevailing at soil depths from 4 cm to 10 cm; and (3) the competitive disadvantage of Minuartia at high moisture levels in deeper soils that support larger annual and perennial species. Sedum smallii is a primary invader in granite outcrop succession because of adaptations which allow it to exist under low moisture conditions in shallow soil unfavorable for growth of other outcrop species. Minuartia uniflora is less resistant to abiotic stress and invades later. Both Sedum and Minuartia exhibit high reproductive potentials typical of colonizing species. Early juvenile stages are the most vulnerable periods in the life cycles of both species. Washout of seeds and seedlings from the communities and the sensitivity of these juvenile stages to moisture stress are the major causes of early mortality. Sedum plants are stunted by increased abiotic stress although population densities may remain high. On the other hand, interspecific competition causes increased mortality. In Minauritia stunting is largely a response to severe environment, whereas mortality is caused by both abiotic stress and interspecific competition. Species zonation and outcrop community structure are therefore a consequence of shifting competitive superiority as physical conditions shift.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAsteraceae 3aCaryophyllaceae 3aSedum 3aabiotic stress 3aannuals 3abiomass 3acommunity structure 3afield experimentation 3agranite 3agrowth retardation 3ahabitats 3ainterspecific competition 3ajuveniles 3alife tables 3apopulation density 3apopulation dynamics 3aseedlings 3aseeds 3asoil depth 3asoil water 3asurvival rate 3aSoutheastern United States1 aMcCormick, J.

Sabinoxylon wicki sp. nov. provides further evidence of similarities in late Campanian-early Maastrichtian vegetation of Texas, New Mexico, and northern Mexico. This species is characterized by mostly solitary vessels, scalariform perforation plates, vessel-ray parenchyma pits similar to intervessel pits, vasicentric tracheids, and two size classes of rays. Storage tissue accounts for close to 50% of its wood volume. Another of the new Cretaceous wood types, referred to as Big Bend Ericalean Wood Type I, has more than 40% ray parenchyma. Both Big Bend Ericalean Wood Type I and Sabinoxylon have a combination of characters that occurs in the order Ericales (sensu APGII). The third new Cretaceous wood type is from a small axis (less than 3 cm diameter), and has a combination of features that is the most common pattern in extant eudicots (vessels solitary and in radial multiples randomly arranged, simple perforation plates and alternate intervessel pits, and heterocellular rays). The Paleocene wood (cf. Cunonioxylon sensu Gottwald) differs from all other North American Paleocene woods and has characteristics found in the predominantly Southern Hemisphere family Cunoniaceae. The characteristics of these new Big Bend woods contribute to a database for fossil angiosperm woods, and allow for comparison of incidences of selected wood anatomical features in Northern Hemisphere Cretaceous woods from Albian to Maastrichtian time as well as comparison with extant woods. Cretaceous woods as a whole differ from Recent woods in having higher incidences of exclusively solitary vessels, scalariform perforation plates, and wide rays (>10-seriate), and lower incidences of ring porosity, wide vessels (>200 μm), vessels in groups, non-random arrangements of vessels, and marginal parenchyma. The occurrence of relatively high percentages of storage cells (>40%) in some Cretaceous trees is noteworthy; the ability to produce wood with varying amounts and arrangements of parenchyma is likely to be a contributing factor to the success of angiosperm trees in a wide variety of environments.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCunoniaceae 3aEricales 3aLate Cretaceous epoch 3aPaleocene epoch 3adatabases 3afossils 3anational parks 3anew species 3aparenchyma (plant tissue) 3aporosity 3atracheids 3atrees 3avegetation 3awood 3awood anatomy 3awood volume 3aMexico 3aNew Mexico 3aTexas 0aBig Bend National Park 0afossil wood 0apaleobotany 0aCretaceous 0aAguja Formation 0aJavelina Formation 0aparenchyma 0aPaleocene 0aBlack Peaks Formation1 aLehman, T.M.0 tIAWA journal.g, v. 30, no. 3 p.293-318dBrillwJournal:6290x0928-15417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1163/22941932-900002203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01980naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002300150245017700173300001600350520076900366592002801135650001501163650001801178650002601196650001501222650001301237650001301250650002901263650001201292700002001304700001501324700002501339700003201364700002101396773009601417856008401513852000901597655001201606IND60112977820221121231019.0141111e20120713xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011297782DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chroma.2012.02.0762doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPrely, Laurette M.10aQuantification of matrix metalloprotease-9 in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid by selected reaction monitoring with microfluidics nano-liquid-chromatography–mass spectrometry  ap. 103-110.  aQuantitative protein analysis by liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry (LC–MS/MS) in the selected reaction monitoring (SRM) mode was used to quantify matrix metalloprotease-9 (MMP-9; ∼90kDa) in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) from patients having undergone lung transplantation.

A hyperspectral camera is used to provide detailed information on fuel reactivity and radiation intensities within the flame zones via the analysis of the C2 and CH radiation emissions. The experiments cover four equivalence ratios (Φ) of 0.63, 0.75, 0.96, and 1.1. A coaxial disc stabilized burner having a twin air jet atomizer is employed. The flame images are taken in the open atmosphere and the assessment of the combustion efficiency is obtained through the measurements of the cooling load inside a cylindrical combustor. The calculated values of the spatial cross-sectional average flame temperatures along the different flames are compared with the corresponding values obtained by a type S thermocouple.The processing of the hyperspectral flame images proves to be an extremely useful tool to define the location, size, and characteristics of the flame zones. The burning of HDO/WCO blend at near stoichiometric conditions appears to be a viable renewable alternative to burning standalone HDO. The burning of a standalone waste cooking oil must be avoided.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3aalternative fuels 3aburning 3acameras 3acombustion efficiency 3acomparative study 3acooking fats and oils 3acooling 3aemissions 3akitchen waste 3arenewable energy sources 3aspectroscopy 3astoichiometry 3atemperature 0aBlended oil flames 0aFlame spectroscopy 0aCH and C2 radicals in flames 0aFlame CH chemiluminescence 0aCombustion characteristics of blended biofuels1 aMoneib, H.A.1 aEl-fatih, Ahmed1 aEl-Sherif, Ashraf F.1 aAyoub, H.S.1 aEmara, Ahmed0 tRenewable energy.g2020 Oct., v. 159 p.893-907dElsevier LtdwJournal:11970x0960-14817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.renene.2020.06.0413Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02843naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094024002200128024001900150040001800169100001700187245010900204300001600313506007600329520143000405592002801835506003701863650001601900650001601916650002001932650004001952650001201992650002202004650002002026650001902046650002002065650001702085650001002102700002202112700002002134700002302154700001902177773011202196856008002308852000902388655001202397IND60625007220221207111544.0181206e201403  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062500722DNAL7 a10.1177/01457217135205672doi7 aPMC41607272pmcid7 a244700422pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChao, Ariana10aSelf-Management in Early Adolescence and Differences by Age at Diagnosis and Duration of Type 1 Diabetes  ap. 167-177.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe purpose of the study was to describe the frequency of diabetes self-management activities, processes, and goals among early adolescents. In addition, differences in self-management by age at diagnosis and duration of diabetes were explored. A cross-sectional design was used to analyze baseline data from 320 adolescents with T1DM enrolled in a multisite clinical trial. Participants completed questionnaires on demographic/clinical characteristics and self-management. There was a transitional pattern of self-management with a high frequency of diabetes care activities, problem solving, and goals and variable amounts of collaboration with parents. After controlling for therapy type and age, youth with short diabetes duration reported performing significantly more diabetes care activities than individuals with a longer duration. Individuals with short diabetes duration had more frequent communication than individuals with a longer duration, which was associated with diagnosis in adolescence. Among those diagnosed as school age children, those with short diabetes duration reported significantly more diabetes goals than those with a longer duration. A more specific understanding of self-management may help clinicians provide more targeted education and support. Adolescents with a long duration of diabetes need additional self-management support, particularly for diabetes care activities and communication.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aadolescence 3aadolescents 3aclinical trials 3ainsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 3aparents 3apatient education 3aproblem solving 3aquestionnaires 3aschool children 3atherapeutics 3ayouth1 aWhittemore, Robin1 aMinges, Karl E.1 aMurphy, Kathryn M.1 aGrey, Margaret0 tDiabetes educator.g2014 Mar., v. 40, no. 2 p.167-177dSAGE PublicationswJournal:jnl42983x1554-60637nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/01457217135205673Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01950naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245009900168300001600267520098000283592002801263650001301291650001801304650001301322650002001335653002601355653001901381653001901400653001401419700001901433773008201452856008101534852000901615655001201624IND60638286620221122110412.0190428s2009    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063828662DNAL7 a10.1163/22941932-900002222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTsuchiya, Ryouta10aRadial variation of vessel lumen diameter in relation to stem increment in 30 hardwood species  ap. 331-342.  aVessel lumen diameter (VLD) is one of the most important anatomical indicators for demarcating juvenile wood and mature wood in hardwoods. In several species, we previously found that the age at which VLD stabilizes (maturation age) and the age at which the mean annual increment in radial stem growth was maximal were approximately the same. In the current study, we investigated the extent to which this relationship is true for 30 species of hardwoods. We found that two types of relation exist between the maturation age of VLD and radial stem growth, i.e., the type in which the maturation age of VLD was similar to the age at which the current annual increment was maximal (Type-I), and the other type in which the maturation age of VLD was similar to the age at which the mean annual increment was maximal (Type-II). Where more than one species was studied for a given genus, the type was shared. Porosity (ring- or diffuse-porous) is not related with maturation type.  aPublisher supplied data 3ahardwood 3ajuvenile wood 3aporosity 3astem elongation 0avessel lumen diameter 0amaturation age 0astem increment 0ahardwoods1 aFurukawa, Ikuo0 tIAWA journal.g, v. 30, no. 3 p.331-342dBrillwJournal:6290x0928-15417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1163/22941932-900002223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02220naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245010100164300001600265520090100281592002801182650002501210650000901235650001301244650001501257650003001272650000901302650001001311650001701321650001601338650001701354651001401371653003001385653002001415653002901435653001801464700001601482700001501498700001501513700001501528700001701543700001801560773008201578856008101660852000901741655001201750IND60638286720221122110406.0190428s2009    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063828672DNAL7 a10.1163/22941932-900002232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIshiguri, F.10aRadial Variation of Anatomical Characteristics in Paraserianthes Falcataria Planted in Indonesia  ap. 343-352.  aRadial variation in anatomical characteristics of five 13-year-old Paraserianthes falcataria (L.) Nielsen (syn. Albizia falcataria (L.) Fosberg), an important commercial tree species in Indonesia, were investigated in order to obtain basic information regarding breeding for wood quality. Both cell wall thickness in wood fibers and vessel percentage showed an almost constant value up to 10 cm from the pith and then increased toward the bark. In contrast, wood fiber percentage decreased from 10 cm toward the bark. The cell wall percentage was lower towards the pith and higher towards the bark. In the five sample trees, significant differences were found in the cell diameter of wood fibers, wood fiber percentage, axial parenchyma percentage, and cell wall percentage. Basic density was affected by the cell wall thickness of wood fibers, but not the vessel percentage and fiber percentage.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFalcataria moluccana 3abark 3abreeding 3acell walls 3aparenchyma (plant tissue) 3apith 3atrees 3awood anatomy 3awood fibers 3awood quality 3aIndonesia 0aParaserianthes falcataria 0acell morphology 0aproportion of cell types 0abasic density1 aHiraiwa, T.1 aIizuka, K.1 aYokota, S.1 aPriadi, D.1 aSumiasri, N.1 aYoshizawa, N.0 tIAWA journal.g, v. 30, no. 3 p.343-352dBrillwJournal:6290x0928-15417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1163/22941932-900002233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02364naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245008700172300001600259520129000275592002801565650001601593650001901609650002601628650001901654650001301673650001301686650000901699650002401708650001801732650001001750700002901760700002001789773010001809856008401909852000901993655001202002IND60112366120221117014904.0141110e201211  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011236612DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ejsobi.2012.09.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGeisseler, Daniel10aTemporal effect of straw addition on amino acid utilization by soil microorganisms  ap. 107-113.  aMicroorganisms may take up simple nitrogen (N) containing organic molecules directly or they may deaminate them first and take up the ammonium released. The present study was carried out to investigate how the incorporation of straw into soil affects the N uptake pathway of soil microorganisms. Soil samples were incubated for 84 days at 20 °C with and without straw addition. The mineralization rate of amino acids was determined using ¹⁵N-labeled amino acids. The addition of straw resulted in net N immobilization and the depletion of the mineral N pool during the first week. Added amino acids were either mineralized or taken up by soil microorganisms within 24 h of their addition. The proportion of added amino acids mineralized during the first week was low, suggesting that 70–95% of the added amino acids were taken up directly. The need for amino acids for the synthesis of proteins for the growing microbial community likely favored their direct uptake. After the first week however, the mineralization rate increased and the direct uptake accounted for only 60–70%. Our results suggest that the direct uptake of organic N was generally the preferred pathway, but that the extracellular ammonification may be an important alternative when N is severely limiting.  aPublisher supplied data 3aamino acids 3aammonification 3amicrobial communities 3amineralization 3anitrogen 3aproteins 3asoil 3asoil microorganisms 3asoil sampling 3astraw1 aJoergensen, Rainer Georg1 aLudwig, Bernard0 tEuropean journal of soil biology.g2012 , v. 53 p.107-113dElsevier Masson SASx1164-55637nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ejsobi.2012.09.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03051naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002000146245009900166300001600265520147400281536022001755592002801975650001102003650001602014650001602030650001502046650001302061650002902074650000902103650002902112650002302141650001502164650002902179650001402208650001002222650002202232650002802254650001502282650002402297700001902321700002002340700002002360773011202380856008002492852000902572655001202581IND60625007420221119122733.0181206e201403  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062500742DNAL7 a10.1177/01457217135205692doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTang, Tricia S.10aOutcomes of a Church-based Diabetes Prevention Program Delivered by PeersbA Feasibility Study  ap. 223-230.  aThis purpose of this study was to investigate the feasibility and potential health impact of a church-based diabetes prevention program delivered by peers. Thirteen at-risk African American adults were recruited to a peer-led diabetes prevention program adapted from the National Diabetes Education Program’s Power to Prevent curriculum. The program consisted of 6 core education sessions followed by 6 biweekly telephone support calls. Components of feasibility examined included recruitment, attendance, and retention. Baseline, 8-week, and 20-week assessments measured clinical outcomes (percentage body weight change, waist circumference, lipid panel, blood pressure) and lifestyle behaviors (eg, physical activity and diet). Of the 13 participants enrolled at baseline, 11 completed the intervention. Mean attendance across 6 core sessions was 5.2 classes (87%). At 8 weeks, significant improvements were found for physical activity (P = .031), waist circumference (P = .049), serum cholesterol (P = .036), systolic blood pressure (P = .013), and fat intake (P = .006). At 20 weeks, not only did participants sustain the improvements made following the core intervention, but they also demonstrated additional improvements for HDL (P = .002) and diastolic blood pressure (P = .004). Findings suggest that it is feasible to conduct a peer-led diabetes prevention program in a church-based setting that has a potentially positive impact on health-related outcomes.  aFunding: This study was supported by the Michigan Institute for Clinical and Health Research (NIH UL1RR024986) and grant P30DK092926 (MCDTR) from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadults 3ablood serum 3acholesterol 3acurriculum 3adiabetes 3adiastolic blood pressure 3adiet 3adisease control programs 3aeducation programs 3afat intake 3ahigh density lipoprotein 3alifestyle 3apeers 3aphysical activity 3asystolic blood pressure 3atelephones 3awaist circumference1 aNwankwo, Robin1 aWhiten, Yolanda1 aOney, Christina0 tDiabetes educator.g2014 Mar., v. 40, no. 2 p.223-230dSAGE PublicationswJournal:jnl42983x1554-60637nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/01457217135205693Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01289naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005000094040001800144100002100162245008800183300001600271500000900287520023400296592002800530650002700558650001600585650000900601650001500610650001800625650002500643650001500668700002200683700001800705773012200723856009700845852000900942655001200951IND60663410720221121040814.0191122e196107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066341072DNAL7 a10.2134/agronj1961.00021962005300040001x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMacGregor, J.

This study developed and validated a method of monitoring and estimating corn (Zea mays L.) yield by means of satellite and ground-based data. In autumn–winter 1999 and spring–summer 2000, eight locations under irrigated and nonirrigated conditions in corn valleys of Mexico were localized by Global Positioning Systems (GPS) and were sampled every 15 d. Photosynthetic active radiation (PAR), leaf area index (LAI), crop development stage (DVS), planting dates, and grain yield data were gathered from the field. The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) was derived from NOAA-Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) images. A growth model was developed to integrate satellite and ground data. Net primary productivity (NPP) was estimated using PAR and NDVI. Dry weight increase (kg ha⁻¹ d⁻¹) was determined considering NPP and the partitioning factor. Results indicated that the model accounts for 89% of the variability in yields under irrigated conditions and 76% under nonirrigated conditions. The methodology seems advantageous in large-scale monitoring and assessment of corn yield.  aPublisher supplied data 3aZea mays 3acorn 3acrop models 3afood security 3aglobal positioning systems 3agrain yield 3airrigated conditions 3airrigation 3aleaf area index 3amonitoring 3anet primary productivity 3anormalized difference vegetation index 3aphotosynthetically active radiation 3aplanting date 3aspatial data 3aMexico1 aChen, Pei-Yu,1 aTiscareño-López, Mario1 aSrinivasan, Raghavan0 tCrop science.g2002 Nov., v. 42, no. 6 p.1943-1949dCrop Science Society of AmericawJournal:jnl44570x0011-183X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2135/cropsci2002.19433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02206naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001600146245008100162300002000243520112600263592002801389650001601417650001001433650001701443650001901460650002301479650001601502650001801518650002001536650002201556700001401578700001901592700001301611773012901624856008201753852000901835655001201844IND60566943620221119034405.0170416e20160825xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056694362DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.6b040862doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSun, Dandan10aImpact of Shock-Induced Lipid Nanobubble Collapse on a Phospholipid Membrane  ap. 18803-18810.  aLipid-shelled nanobubbles have shown great potential in drug and gene therapy. To improve our understanding of the ultrasound-mediated interactions of lipid nanobubbles with plasma membranes at the molecular level, we investigated the effect of shock-induced lipid nanobubble collapse on a lipid bilayer using coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations. We observed the collapse of lipid nanobubbles and the formation of water nanojets. The water nanojets could induce structural changes in membranes. When shock velocities were sufficiently high, the deformed bilayers were hemispherical and water pores were generated. Both the nanojets and the membrane deformations depended on the shock velocity and the initial lipid nanobubble diameter. In the recovery simulations, the bilayers were able to heal themselves, indicating that the bilayer poration was temporary. Besides, compared with the cases of vacuum nanobubbles, the lipid nanobubbles could weaken the effects of shock waves. All this molecular-level information from simulations will be useful for improving the biomedical applications of lipid nanobubbles.  aPublisher supplied data 3adeformation 3adrugs 3agene therapy 3alipid bilayers 3amolecular dynamics 3ananobubbles 3aphospholipids 3aplasma membrane 3asimulation models1 aLin, Xubo1 aZhang, Zuoheng1 aGu, Ning0 tThe Journal of Physical Chemistry C.g2016 Aug. 25, v. 120, no. 33 p.18803-18810dAmerican Chemical Societyx1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.jpcc.6b040863Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02604naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001200149245010500161520143400266592002801700650001201728650001301740650001101753650001301764650001801777650002101795650001901816650001301835653001501848653002101863653001601884653004101900653003501941700006701976773009402043856008402137852000902221655001202230IND60721911720221119180647.0210423e20210501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072191172DNAL7 a10.1016/j.appet.2020.1050892doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Di,10aMindfulness, depression, and emotional eating: The moderating role of nonjudging of inner experience  aEmotional eating is defined as the tendency to increase food consumption in order to modify negative emotional states. Theories on emotional eating attribute its cause to inadequate emotion regulation, specifically an inability to draw awareness to and accept distress. Mindfulness, or the ability to pay attention to and accept internal and external experiences, is thought to attenuate the association between internalizing distress and emotional eating. Nevertheless, there has been little research examining the moderating role of mindfulness in the relationship between psychological distress and emotional eating. The present study used a cross-sectional design to probe the effects of specific facets of mindfulness, as measured by the Five Factor Mindfulness Questionnaire, on the relationship between internalizing distress (i.e., depression and anxiety) and emotional eating in a diverse community sample (N = 248). Results showed that depression significantly interacted with nonjudging of inner experience to predict emotional eating. Those who were high in nonjudging endorsed less emotional eating than those who were average or low in nonjudging. This was significant only at low levels of depression. These findings delineate the moderating role of specific aspects of trait mindfulness in the association between depression and emotional eating and may inform more targeted intervention and prevention efforts.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanxiety 3aappetite 3adesign 3adistress 3aeating habits 3afood consumption 3aquestionnaires 3aresearch 0aDepression 0aEmotional eating 0aMindfulness 0aFive facet mindfulness questionnaire 0aNonjudging of inner experience1 aForestell, Catherine A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4345-90360 tAppetite.g2021 May 01, v. 160 p.105089-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl31756x0195-66637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.appet.2020.1050893Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02761naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002300139245010700162300001600269520151900285592002801804650001901832650002001851650002101871650001001892650003301902650001001935650001401945650001801959650001101977650001201988651001602000651001302016700001902029700002002048700002202068700002202090700002502112773011802137856007502255852000902330655001202339IND60129751520221119035938.0151126e201208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012975152DNAL7 a10.1645/GE-3066.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCurran, Stephen S.10aPhylogenetic Position of Creptotrema funduli in the Allocreadiidae Based on Partial 28S rDNA Sequences  ap. 873-875.  aThe infrequently reported allocreadiid digenean Creptotrema funduli Mueller, 1934 is documented from the blackstripe topminnow, Fundulus notatus (Cyprinodontiformes: Fundulidae), in the headwaters of the Biloxi River, Harrison County, Mississippi. Specimens from Mississippi were compared with the type material from Fundulus diaphanus menona from Oneida Lake, New York, and no substantial difference was found. A fragment of ribosomal DNA, comprising a short portion of the 3′ end of 18S nuclear rDNA gene, internal transcribed spacer (ITS) genes (including ITS1, 5.8S, and ITS2), and the 5′ end of the 28S gene including variable domains D1–D3 was sequenced for the species. A portion of the 28S rDNA gene from C. funduli, plus similar fragments from 8 other allocreadiids and the callodistomatid Prosthenhystera sp., were aligned and subjected to maximum likelihood and Bayesian inference analyses. Resulting phylogenetic trees were derived from the analyses and used to estimate the relationship of Creptotrema Travassos, Artigas, and Pereira, 1928 with other allocreadiids. Creptotrema was found to be closely related to Megalogonia Surber, 1928 and 3 Neotropical genera, i.e., Wallinia Pearse, 1920, Creptotrematina Yamaguti, 1954, and Auriculostoma Scholz, Aguirre-Macedo, and Choudhury, 2004. No molecular data were available for species in Creptotrema prior to this study, so the ITS1, 5.8S, and ITS2 genes have been made available for comparative studies involving neotropical species in the genus.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAllocreadiidae 3aBayesian theory 3aFundulus notatus 3agenes 3ainternal transcribed spacers 3alakes 3aphylogeny 3aribosomal DNA 3arivers 3atropics 3aMississippi 3aNew York1 aPulis, Eric E.1 aHugg, Dennis O.1 aBrown, Jessica P.1 aManuel, Lynnae C.1 aOverstreet, Robin M.0 tJournal of parasitology.g2012 Aug., v. 98, no. 4 p.873-875dAmerican Society of Parasitologistsx0022-33957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1645%2FGE-3066.13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02371naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002400146245009800170300001800268500000900286520121100295592002801506650001301534650000901547650001601556650001501572650002101587650002701608650001201635650001201647650002501659650001201684650001101696651001101707651001801718700002401736773012301760856008101883852000901964655001201973IND60665271320221118083728.0191228e200511  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066527132DNAL7 a10.2135/cropsci2005.00142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMiguez, Fernando E.10aReview of Corn Yield Response under Winter Cover Cropping Systems Using Meta-Analytic Methods  ap. 2318-2329.  aepub  aExtensive research on the use of winter cover crops (WCC) under different agricultural practices in the USA and Canada has shown both negative and positive effects on subsequent corn (Zea mays L.) yield. These contrasting results determine the need for a comprehensive quantitative review. The objective of this study was to use meta-analytic methods to summarize and quantitatively describe the effects of WCC on corn yield based on peer-reviewed published research. Thirty-six studies were included in the analysis representing different regions of the USA and Canada under different agricultural practices (i.e., species, fertilization, kill date, tillage, etc.). The effect-size used to compare studies was the response ratio, calculated as yield of corn following WCC over yield of corn following no cover. Biculture WCC increased corn yield by 21%, but there is greater variation due to the small number of studies in this group. Overall, grass WCC neither increased nor decreased corn yields and this response was not dependent on the use of N fertilizer. Legume WCC increased corn yield by 37% when no nitrogen (N) fertilizer was applied and this benefit decreased with application of N fertilizer.  aPublisher supplied data 3aZea mays 3acorn 3acover crops 3acrop yield 3acropping systems 3afertilizer application 3agrasses 3alegumes 3anitrogen fertilizers 3atillage 3awinter 3aCanada 3aUnited States1 aBollero, Germán A.0 tCrop science.g2005 Nov., v. 45, no. 6 p.2318-2329dCrop Science Society of AmericawJournal:jnl44570x0011-183X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2135/cropsci2005.00143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03211naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001500146245016700161300002000328520165700348592002802005650003702033650001602070650002802086650002102114650004902135650001102184650001802195650001902213650001802232650001102250650001902261650002202280650002302302650001702325650002902342650001102371650001702382700001602399700001602415700001502431700001702446700001902463700001502482773012902497856008202626852000902708655001202717IND60566943720221119034611.0170416e20160825xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056694372DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.6b041312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Long10aIn Situ Synthesis of V4+ and Ce3+ Self-Doped BiVO4/CeO2 Heterostructured Nanocomposites with High Surface Areas and Enhanced Visible-Light Photocatalytic Activity  ap. 18548-18559.  aIn order to achieve high performance in visible-light photocatalysis, V⁴⁺ and Ce³⁺ self-doped BiVO₄/CeO₂ heterostructured nanocomposites with high surface areas were prepared using the templating approach employing mesoporous silica MCM-41 as the hard template. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra have demonstrated the presence of plentiful V⁴⁺ and Ce³⁺ species in the nanocomposites accompanied by the formation of oxygen vacancies. The presence of V⁴⁺ species is further identified by the electron spin resonance (ESR) spectrum. Furthermore, the BiVO₄ and CeO₂ could be affecting each other by arousing the structural changes in the formed nanocomposites. The V⁴⁺ and Ce³⁺ self-doped 0.4BiVO₄/0.6CeO₂ nanocomposite with the surface area as large as 78.35 m²/g exhibits the highest photocatalytic activity for the rhodamine B (RhB) and methyl orange (MO) degradation and photoelectrochemical performances. The enhanced photocatalytic mechanism is systematically studied via UV–vis diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS), photoluminescence (PL) spectra, transient photocurrent responses, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) spectra. The remarkable enhanced photocatalytic activity could be mainly attributed to the formed heterojunction nanostructures, the presence of defect states induced by oxygen vacancies, and self-doped V⁴⁺ and Ce³⁺ centers, as well as high surface areas. A possible photocatalytic mechanism over the V⁴⁺ and Ce³⁺ self-doped BiVO₄/CeO₂ nanocomposites is proposed based on the active species trapping experiments and calculated energy band structures.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aceric oxide 3adielectric spectroscopy 3aelectric current 3aelectron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aenergy 3amethyl orange 3ananocomposites 3ananomaterials 3aoxygen 3aphotocatalysis 3aphotoluminescence 3aphysical chemistry 3aporous media 3areflectance spectroscopy 3asilica 3asurface area1 aMeng, Dawei1 aWu, Xiuling1 aWang, Anqi1 aWang, Junxia1 aWang, Yongqian1 aYu, Meihua0 tThe Journal of Physical Chemistry C.g2016 Aug. 25, v. 120, no. 33 p.18548-18559dAmerican Chemical Societyx1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.jpcc.6b041313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03586naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001300149245015100162300001600313500002000329500000900349520177400358592002802132596004102160596007502201650002202276650001402298650001002312650002102322650001502343650001802358650001602376650001702392650001402409650002502423650001702448650002002465650002402485650004202509650001702551700001802568700002002586700002002606700001402626700001902640700002002659700002302679700002002702700002102722700002402743700001702767773013102784856008402915852000902999655001203008IND60665271420221118084013.0220805e201701  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066527142DNAL7 a10.2135/cropsci2016.06.04592doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZou, Jun10aMapping QTLs Controlling Agronomic Traits in the ‘Attila’ × ‘CDC Go’ Spring Wheat Population under Organic Management using 90K SNP Array  ap. 365-377.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aepub  aOur group previously reported five quantitative trait loci (QTL) associated with plant height, test weight, thousand‐kernel weight, and grain protein content in a recombinant inbred line population derived from spring wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) cultivars ‘Attila’ and ‘CDC Go’, evaluated across three environments (2008–2010) under organic management and genotyped with 579 diversity arrays technology and Rht‐B1 markers. No QTL was identified for flowering time, maturity, grain yield, and number of tillers across all three environments. In the present study, we reanalyzed the same phenotypic data with a subset of 1200 informative single‐nucleotide polymorphic (SNP) markers out of the 90K SNP array and three gene‐specific markers (Ppd‐D1, Vrn‐A1, and Rht‐B1) to investigate if high marker density improves QTL detection. Here, five moderate‐ and eleven minor‐effect QTLs were detected across all three organic environments using the new genotypic data, including 13 QTLs that were not previously detected. Up to five QTLs were detected for each trait, except grain protein content, which individually accounted for 5.5 to 18.8% of phenotypic variance. For each trait, the total phenotypic and genetic variance explained by all detected QTLs varied from 9.3 to 39.4 and from 24.6 to 96.8%, respectively, which was much greater than in our previous study. One of the moderate‐effect QTLs on 5A was coincidental for flowering time and maturity and mapped close to the Vrn‐A1 gene, while the second moderate‐effect coincidental QTL on 4B was associated with both plant height and maturity but was 27 cM from the Rht‐B1 gene. Results from this study provide additional information for wheat researchers and organic wheat breeders.  aPublisher supplied data  cSaskatchewan Ministry of Agriculture  cWestern Grains Research Foundation, Agriculture and Agri‐Food Canada 3aTriticum aestivum 3acultivars 3agenes 3agenetic variance 3agenotyping 3agrain protein 3agrain yield 3ainbred lines 3aphenotype 3aphenotypic variation 3aplant height 3aprotein content 3aquantitative traits 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism arrays 3aspring wheat1 aSemagn, Kassa1 aIqbal, Muhammad1 aN'Diaye, Amidou1 aChen, Hua1 aAsif, Muhammad1 aNavabi, Alireza1 aPerez‐Lara, Enid1 aPozniak, Curtis1 aYang, Rong‐Cai1 aRandhawa, Harpinder1 aSpaner, Dean0 tCrop science.g2017 Jan., v. 57, no. 1 p.365-377dThe Crop Science Society of America, Inc.wJournal:jnl44570x0011-183X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2135/cropsci2016.06.04593Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04447naa a2200781 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100005500151245010300206300001600309520188800325592002802213650003402241650001802275650002102293650004402314650004102358650002602399650002902425650002502454650001702479650001402496650001802510650001202528650001602540650001802556650001502574650001702589650001502606650004302621650002102664650001902685650001402704650001202718650001902730650003302749650001302782650001602795650002302811650002102834650001602855653004802871653004202919653003302961653005202994653003403046653003103080653002503111653003303136653001803169653001103187653004503198700005703243700005603300700001603356700001603372700001603388700001503404700001403419700001703433773010803450856008603558852000903644655001203653IND60531668020221120112735.0190318e20161105xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053166802DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbpol.2016.07.0412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBiddeci, G.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6867-987910aHalloysite nanotubes loaded with peppermint essential oil as filler for functional biopolymer film  ap. 548-557.  aThe purpose of this paper is to show how a functional bionanocomposite film with both antioxidant and antimicrobial activities was successfully prepared by the filling of a pectin matrix with modified Halloysite nanotubes (HNT) containing the essential peppermint oil (PO). Firstly, HNT surfaces were functionalized with cucurbit[6]uril (CB[6]) molecules with the aim to enhance the affinity of the nanofiller towards PO, which was estimated by means of HPLC experiments. The HNT/CB[6] hybrid was characterized by several methods (thermogravimetry, FT-IR spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy) highlighting the influence of the supramolecular interactions on the composition, thermal behavior and morphology of the filler. Then, a pectin+HNT/CB[6] biofilm was prepared by the use of the casting method under specific experimental conditions in order to favor the entrapment of the volatile PO into the nanocomposite structure. Water contact angle measurements, thermogravimetry and tensile tests evidenced the effects of the modified filler on the thermo-mechanical and wettability properties of pectin, which were correlated to the microscopic structure of the biocomposite film. In addition, PO release in food simulant solvent was investigated at different temperatures (4 and 25°C), whereas the antioxidant activity of the nanocomposite film was estimated using the DPPH method. Finally, we studied the in vitro antibacterial activity of the biofilm against Escherichia coli (Gram-negative) and Staphylococcus aureus (Gram-positive), which were isolated by beef and cow milk, respectively. These experiments were carried out at specific temperatures (4, 37 and 65°C) that can be useful for a multi-step food conservation. This paper puts forwards an easy strategy to prepare a functional sustainable edible film with thermo-sensitive antioxidant/antimicrobial activity.  aPublisher supplied data 3a2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl 3aCucurbitaceae 3aEscherichia coli 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aMentha piperita nothosubsp. piperita 3aStaphylococcus aureus 3aantibacterial properties 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3abeef cows 3abiocomposites 3abiofilm 3abiopolymers 3acontact angle 3adairy cows 3aedible films 3ahalloysite 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3ain vitro studies 3ananocomposites 3ananotubes 3apectins 3apeppermint oil 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asolvents 3atemperature 3athermal properties 3athermogravimetry 3awettability 0aHalloysite nanotubes (PubChem CID: 6337008) 0aCucurbit[6]uril (PubChem CID: 196163) 0aPectin (PubChem CID: 441476) 0aPeppermint essential oil (PubChem CID: 6850741) 0aMenthone (PubChem CID: 26447) 0aDPPH (PubMed CID: 2735032) 0aHalloysite nanotubes 0aNanocomposite food packaging 0aEssential oil 0aPectin 0aAntimicrobial and antioxidant properties1 aCavallaro, G.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2145-01611 aDi Blasi, F.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2055-69731 aLazzara, G.1 aMassaro, M.1 aMilioto, S.1 aParisi, F.1 aRiela, S.1 aSpinelli, G.0 tCarbohydrate polymers.g2016 Nov. 05, v. 152 p.548-557dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl47819x0144-86177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbpol.2016.07.0413Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02815naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001600140245010300156300002000259520157400279592002801853650001301881650001101894650001301905650003401918650001501952650003101967650001901998650001202017650001702029650001502046700001802061700002002079700001602099700001602115700001702131700002102148700001702169773012402186856007402310852000902384655001202393IND60640897920221119182853.0190505e20160713xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064089792DNAL7 a10.1039/c6ra12092j2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee, Seulah10aUltrafast single-droplet bouncing actuator with electrostatic force on superhydrophobic electrodes  ap. 66729-66737.  aThe ultrafast bouncing motion of a liquid droplet has been investigated for droplet manipulation with a single droplet actuator using an electrostatic force for the first time. Under an electrostatic field, various kinds of liquid droplets (e.g. deionized water and poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS) solution) were rapidly bounced between two superhydrophobic electrodes, one from a capacitive electrode and another from a stage electrode. They were formed by sequential processes of a galvanic displacement method and the coating of a self-assembled monolayer on circular-patterned Cu films on a printed circuit board substrate. The frequency of the bouncing motion of the droplets reached up to 0.57 kHz and 0.71 kHz for water and PEDOT:PSS solution, respectively. Furthermore, the effects of the droplet volume, different types of liquid material such as water and conducting polymer solution, and applied voltages on the droplet bouncing motion were fully analyzed. A charge transfer between the droplet surface and the super-hydrophobic electrodes leads to droplet bouncing and its repetitive charging/discharging process across two electrodes results in a continuous bouncing operation. We successfully measured the transferred current of nA level from several single droplets under rapidly-bouncing motion via the stage electrode. This rapidly-bouncing droplet actuator using electrostatic force can be effectively used for various chemical and biological applications due to its high-speed, contamination-free and facile method.  aPublisher supplied data 3acoatings 3acopper 3adroplets 3aelectric potential difference 3aelectrodes 3aelectrostatic interactions 3ahydrophobicity 3aliquids 3apolystyrenes 3asulfonates1 aLee, Sanggeun1 aHwang, Hyunseok1 aHong, Juree1 aLee, Soonil1 aLee, Jaehong1 aChae, Youngcheol1 aLee, Taeyoon0 tRSC advances.g2016 July 13, v. 6, no. 71 p.66729-66737dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c6ra12092j3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03003naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002000155245011800175300001400293520145200307592002801759650001901787650001701806650001401823650002101837650001601858650002101874650002701895650001501922650001701937650002201954650001901976650001601995650001402011653001302025653001002038653002102048653001602069653002402085653001102109700002302120700002302143700002302166700001502189700001602204700002802220700001602248773011002264856009002374852000902464655001202473IND60532558920221123044845.0190405e201511  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053255892DNAL7 a10.1016/j.anireprosci.2015.09.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAnel-López, L.10aReduced glutathione addition improves both the kinematics and physiological quality of post-thawed red deer sperm  ap. 73-79.  aThe potential protective effect of reduced glutathione (GSH) and trolox (TRX), an analogue of vitamin E, supplementation during in vitro culture (2h, 39°C) of electroejaculated frozen/thawed red deer sperm was investigated. Cryopreserved sperm were thawed and incubated with no additive (Control) and 1mM or 5mM of each antioxidant to find out whether these supplementations can maintain the sperm quality, considering the use of thawed samples for in vitro techniques such as in vitro fertilisation (IVF), sperm sex sorting or refreezing. The effect of GSH on sperm motility was positive compared to TRX which was negative (P<0.001). After 2h of incubation at 39°C, use of GSH improved motility while TRX supplementation reduced sperm motility compared with Control samples without antioxidant. Use of TRX at both concentrations (1 and 5mM; TRX1 and TRX5) resulted in lesser percentages of apoptotic sperm (12.4±1.1% and 11.7±0.9%) than GSH1, GSH5 (15.2±1% and 14.6±1.1%) and Control samples (16.9±1.2%) (P<0.001). Use of GSH at both concentrations (1 and 5mM) resulted in greater mitochondrial activity as compared with findings for the Control, TRX1 and TRX5 groups. Results of this study indicate that GSH is a suitable supplement for electroejaculated red deer sperm. It would be necessary to conduct fertility trials (in vivo and in vitro), to assess whether GSH supplementation of thawed red deer sperm could improve fertility rates.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCervus elaphus 3aantioxidants 3aapoptosis 3acryopreservation 3aglutathione 3ain vitro culture 3ain vitro fertilization 3akinematics 3amitochondria 3aprotective effect 3asperm motility 3aspermatozoa 3avitamin E 0aRed deer 0aSperm 0aCryopreservation 0aAntioxidant 0aReduced glutathione 0aTrolox1 aGarcia-Alvarez, O.1 aMaroto-Morales, A.1 aIniesta-Cuerda, M.1 aRamón, M.1 aSoler, A.J.1 aFernández-Santos, M.R.1 aGarde, J.J.0 tAnimal reproduction science.g2015 Nov., v. 162 p.73-79dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl11636x0378-43207nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.anireprosci.2015.09.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03061naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002200149245011800171300001600289500002000305500000900325520170300334592002802037596003902065596003902104650002902143650002202172650001402194650002102208650001002229650001602239650001602255650003002271650001802301650001402319650001702333651001102350700002202361700002002383773013102403856008402534852000902618655001202627IND60665271620221118084034.0220805e201801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066527162DNAL7 a10.2135/cropsci2017.05.02812doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRuud, Anja Karine10aEffects of Three Parastagonospora nodorum Necrotrophic Effectors on Spring Wheat under Norwegian Field Conditions  ap. 159-168.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aepub  aThe wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) disease Septoria nodorum blotch (SNB) is caused by the necrotrophic fungus Parastagonospora nodorum (Berk.) Quaedvlieg, Verkley & Crous and causes significant yield and quality losses in several wheat growing regions. The resistance mechanisms are quantitative and progress in resistance breeding has been slow. However, gene‐for‐gene interactions involving necrotrophic effectors (NEs) and sensitivity genes (Snn) are involved, providing hope for more effective breeding. Although the interactions are significant determinants of seedling SNB susceptibility, their role in adult plant leaf blotch resistance in the field is less understood. In this study, the frequency of SnTox genes was investigated in 62 P. nodorum isolates collected in Norway. A panel of Norwegian and international spring wheat lines and cultivars was screened under natural SNB infection in a mist‐irrigated field nursery across 7 yr. The lines were infiltrated in the greenhouse with the purified NEs SnToxA, SnTox1, and SnTox3, and the prevalence of corresponding sensitivity was investigated, as well as correlation between NE sensitivity and resistance level in the field. The frequencies of SnToxA, SnTox1, and SnTox3 in the isolates were 0.69, 0.53 and 0.76, respectively. Sensitivity to SnToxA, SnTox1, and SnTox3 was present in 45, 12, and 55% of the plant material. Sensitivity to SnToxA was associated with significantly higher disease severity in the field than insensitivity. This indicates that elimination of SnToxA sensitivity in the breeding material by effector infiltrations or marker‐assisted selection can be an effective way to increase field resistance to SNB.  aPublisher supplied data  a185946cResearch Council of Norway  a224833cResearch Council of Norway 3aParastagonospora nodorum 3aTriticum aestivum 3acultivars 3adisease severity 3afungi 3agreenhouses 3aleaf blotch 3amarker-assisted selection 3amature plants 3aseedlings 3aspring wheat 3aNorway1 aDieseth, Jon Arne1 aLillemo, Morten0 tCrop science.g2018 Jan., v. 58, no. 1 p.159-168dThe Crop Science Society of America, Inc.wJournal:jnl44570x0011-183X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2135/cropsci2017.05.02813Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03302naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001800155245011100173300001400284520168900298592002801987650002502015650001702040650002002057650002502077650000902102650002402111650003702135650002102172650001702193650001202210650001002222650001602232650001802248650001102266650002702277650002902304650002402333650001002357650001202367650001902379653001002398653001802408653001702426653002302443653002102466700001502487700001402502700002002516773011302536856009002649852000902739655001202748IND50066729520221123014831.0190405e201306  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006672952DNAL7 a10.1016/j.smallrumres.2013.02.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBoujenane, I.10aEstimation of genetic parameters and genetic gains for reproductive traits and body weight of D’man ewes  ap. 40-46.  aThe current study consisted of genetic analysis for reproductive performance and body weight using from 2003 to 2863 records of 1018 D’man ewes born from 136 sires and 468 dams. Data were collected from 1988 till 2009 in the Errachidia Experimental Station (ESE) of the Institut National de la Recherche Agronomique. Conception rate (CR), litter size at birth (LSB), litter size at weaning (LSW), litter weight at birth (LWB), litter weight at weaning (LWW), gestation length (GL) and ewe's body weight (EBW) averaged 94.4%, 2.38 lambs, 2.03 lambs, 6.23kg, 39.6kg, 149.9 days and 44.8kg, respectively. The analysis of variance showed that LWB and EBW were influenced by age of ewe, parity and period of lambing. Also, period of lambing had significant effects on all studied traits. However, age of the ewe did not affect LSB and LWW. Genetic parameters and genetic trends for reproductive traits and EBW, estimated through REML and BLUP procedures using a repeatability animal model including additive genetic and permanent environment effects, in addition to fixed effects, resulted in heritability estimates of 0.09, 0.11, 0.10, 0.10, 0, 0.22 and 0.44 and repeatability estimates of 0.19, 0.13, 0.16, 0.10, 0, 0.26 and 0.62 for LSB, LSW, LWB, LWW, CR, GL and EBW, respectively. Genetic correlations among traits ranged from −0.21 and 0.93 and phenotypic correlations varied from −0.07 to 0.82. Estimated annual genetic progress was very small; 0.0009 lambs for LSB and −0.0078kg for EBW. The study concluded that the actual genetic parameter estimates could be used in a breeding program to improve the productivity of D’man ewes and to make significant genetic progress.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanalysis of variance 3abirth weight 3aconception rate 3aenvironmental impact 3aewes 3agenetic correlation 3agenetic techniques and protocols 3agestation period 3aheritability 3alambing 3alambs 3alitter size 3alitter weight 3amodels 3aphenotypic correlation 3areproductive performance 3areproductive traits 3asires 3aweaning 3aweaning weight 0aSheep 0aD’man breed 0aReproduction 0aGenetic parameters 0aGenetic progress1 aChikhi, A.1 aSylla, M.1 aIbnelbachyr, M.0 tSmall ruminant research.g2013 June, v. 113, no. 1 p.40-46dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl44843x0921-44887nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.smallrumres.2013.02.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03833naa a2200673 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100002000171245015800191300001600349520175300365592002802118650002502146650001302171650002902184650000902213650001702222650000902239650002202248650002402270650002702294650001402321650001402335650000902349650002402358650001502382650001202397650002302409650001902432650001002451650001802461650002602479650001202505650005302517650003102570650002102601650002502622650003902647650001102686650001702697650004002714650002802754650002002782650002202802650003802824700001702862700002002879700001902899700001602918700001602934773013302950856005503083852000903138655001203147IND4477404420221121034517.0120423e201206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447740442DNAL7 a215957572pmid7 a10.1111/j.1439-0396.2011.01165.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlizadeh, A.

It was hypothesised that a diet supplemented with an Iranian SS variety (IL‐111) in combination with fish oil (FO) would result in higher concentrations of trans‐18:1 (including vaccenic acid) and conjugated linoleic acids in milk fat than feeding an unsupplemented control diet. Our objective was to determine the effects of feeding diets containing: (i) Control: (C); (ii) 25 g of roasted SS IL‐111 (RSS); (iii) 20 g FO and (iv) 25 g RSS + 10 g FO (RSS + FO) per kilogram of dietary DM on feed intake, ruminal fermentation, milk production and fatty acid profile. Eight multiparous Holstein cows were used in a replicated 4 × 4 Latin square design study. The experiment had four periods of 21 days. Milk Fat percentage was lower (p < 0.01) with FO supplementation and averaged 19.0 and 21.5 g/kg milk with FO and RSS + FO compared with 30.3 and 32.5 g/kg with C and RSS. Feed intake also was lower (p < 0.01) with FO vs. C (23.1 vs. 24.5 kg/day) but feeding RSS resulted in greater feed intake compared with other treatments (26 kg/day). Despite lower feed intake with FO, milk production did not change from controls but feeding RSS + FO resulted in greater milk yield than controls (42.6 vs. 39.3 kg/day). Ruminal pH was greater (p < 0.01) in cows fed FO than other treatments. Supplemental FO alone or in combination with RSS resulted in dramatic increases (p < 0.01) in c9,t11‐18:2 in milk fat (12.7 and 13.2 g/day vs. 5.8 and 7.02 with C and RSS). It was surprising to note that 25 g/kg RSS can improve feed intake.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCarthamus tinctorius 3aHolstein 3aconjugated linoleic acid 3acows 3adairy cattle 3adiet 3adry matter intake 3aexperimental design 3afatty acid composition 3afish oils 3alactation 3amilk 3amilk fat percentage 3amilk yield 3amilking 3arumen fermentation 3asafflower seed 3aseeds 3avaccenic acid 2aAnimal Feedxanalysis 2aAnimals 2aCarthamus tinctoriusxchemistryxclassification. 2aCattlexbloodxphysiology. 2aDietxveterinary 2aEatingxdrug effects 2aFatty Acidsxanalysisxmetabolism. 2aFemale 2aFermentation 2aFish Oilsxchemistryxpharmacology. 2aLactationxdrug effects 2aMilkxchemistry 2aRumenxmetabolism 2aSeedsxchemistryxclassification.1 aAlikhani, M.1 aGhorbani, G.

We previously found that propolis collected on Jeju Island, located off the southern coast of Korea, originates from a single plant, Angelica keiskei KOIDZUMI (Ashitaba). A. keiskei has been well-studied as a health food and has been reported to promote nerve growth factor (NGF) production. Propolis formed from the resin of A. keiskei is expected to have a similar promotional effect on NGF production. NGF is a potential pharmacological agent for Alzheimer’s disease. In this study, the effects of an ethanolic extract of propolis from Jeju Island (EEPJ) on NGF secretion and cell viability in T98G human glioblastoma cells were evaluated. Ethanolic extracts of propolis from Brazil (Baccharis type) and from Uruguay (Populus type) were also studied for comparison. We found that EEPJ significantly increased NGF secretion in the cells in a concentration-dependent manner. Furthermore, the effects of 27 compounds previously isolated from EEPJ were also evaluated. Several compounds were found to have a promotion effect on NGF secretion, and the structure–activity relationships of the compounds were considered relative to their promotional effect on NGF biosynthesis. The promotional effect of EEPJ is a characteristic biological activity that is not present with other propolis types, so the propolis from Jeju Island may have potential applications as a therapeutic candidate for Alzheimer’s disease.  aPublisher supplied data  aKAKENHI 23580180cJapan Society for the Promotion of Science  aKAKENHI 18KK0165cJapan Society for the Promotion of Science 3aAngelica keiskei 3aApis mellifera 3aBaccharis 3aPopulus 3abioactive properties 3abiosynthesis 3acell viability 3acoasts 3aglioblastoma 3ahealth foods 3ahumans 3anerve growth factor 3apropolis 3asecretion 3atherapeutics 3aBrazil 3aSouth Korea 3aUruguay1 aKako, Hironari1 aYokogoshi, Hidehiko1 aAhn, Mok-Ryeon1 aKumazawa, Shigenori1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9687-96190 tNatural medicines.g2021 Sept., v. 75, no. 4 p.1030-1036dSpringer SingaporewJournal:jnl4059015x1340-34437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11418-021-01535-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01876naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002400148245007400172300001600246520076100262592002801023650002701051650001301078650001601091650001501107650001201122650002001134650001501154653001101169653002001180653001901200653002101219653001301240700002001253700001601273773011001289856008201399852000901481655001201490IND60600289520221123013810.0180703e201402  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060028952DNAL7 a10.1016/j.clnu.2013.10.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSmith, Christina H.10aThickened fluids: Investigation of users' experiences and perceptions  ap. 171-174.  aFluid thickeners are an important and commonly-used strategy to manage swallowing difficulties however there are no reports of the perceptions and experiences of parents of children using thickeners.Semi-structured interviews of 14 parents having a child using fluid thickeners due to swallowing difficulties.Parents reported improvements in quality of life and health through the use of thickeners.

The seroprevalence in ≥3-yr-old dogs was significantly higher (P < 0.05) than that in dogs less than 3-yr-old. The results of the present study indicated that infection with T. gondii in household dogs in Jiangsu Province is a public health concern.  aPublisher supplied data 3aToxoplasma gondii 3aagglutination tests 3aantibodies 3ablood serum 3adog diseases 3adogs 3apublic health 3aseroprevalence 3aChina1 aLiu, Quan1 aLi, Shumin1 aWei, Feng1 aJin, Hongtao1 aYang, Minghui0 tJournal of parasitology.g2012 Aug., v. 98, no. 4 p.878-879dAmerican Society of Parasitologistsx0022-33957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1645%2FGE-3098.13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02691naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001800139245010000157300001400257520143400271592002801705650001101733650001401744650002701758650002001785650003001805650001801835650000801853650002601861650001201887650002001899650001001919653002301929700002201952700002001974700001501994700001802009700001802027773014202045856007302187852000902260655001202269IND60681641020221120040556.0200117e20190618xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068164102DNAL7 a10.3920/CEP1800342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMatheus, A.C.10aAllometric correction of peak VO₂ in obese adults undergoing cardiopulmonary exercise testing  ap. 77-83.  aWe hypothesised that the reduction in cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) of individuals with less severe obesity is small or non-existent when the allometric rather than the ratio standard is used for the comparison. We aimed to evaluate the influence of obesity on CRF, and to compare peak VO₂ using allometric corrections in asymptomatic adults with a wide range of body mass index. The results of 780 adults (age 41±13 years) who underwent cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) were evaluated. Participants were stratified according to body mass index (BMI): normal weight (n=227), overweight (n=198), and obese class 1 (n=155), 2 (n=131), and 3 (n=69). After cardiovascular risk assessment, the participants underwent CPET on a treadmill ramp protocol. The allometric exponents calculated were 0.60 and 0.62 for obese and non-obese groups respectively, with no significant differences. After using BMI strata in a multivariate analysis of covariance, we found an allometric exponent of 0.65. Peak VO₂ using ratio standards significantly declined among all stratified groups. After allometric correction, peak VO₂ remained significantly reduced only in women with obesity class 3 and men with obesity classes 2 and 3. When ratio standards were used to compare peak VO₂, the effect of obesity on CRF was overestimated. Allometric correction of peak VO₂ is more reasonable, and should be adopted as a routine for CPET.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadults 3aallometry 3aanalysis of covariance 3abody mass index 3acardiorespiratory fitness 3aexercise test 3amen 3amultivariate analysis 3aobesity 3arisk assessment 3awomen 0apeak oxygen uptake1 aGagliardi, A.R.T.1 aSperandio, E.F.1 aRomiti, M.1 aArantes, R.L.1 aDourado, V.Z.0 tComparative exercise physiology.g2019 June 18, v. 15, no. 2 p.77-83dWageningen Academic PublisherswJournal:J000000061x1755-25597nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3920/CEP1800343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02666naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001500139245009900154300001600253520131500269592002801584650001601612650002801628650001901656650002901675650001501704650001101719650002301730650001201753650001801765650001401783650001701797650001401814650001101828650001001839650001501849651001101864700001801875700001601893700001801909700001601927700001901943700002001962773011801982856007502100852000902175655001202184IND60129752220221119040103.0151126e201208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012975222DNAL7 a10.1645/GE-3131.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMovila, A.10aAbundance of Adult Ticks (Acari: Ixodidae) in the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant Exclusion Zone  ap. 883-884.  aThe Chernobyl nuclear disaster resulted in contamination of vast areas in Europe. To date, there is little knowledge about the effects of radioactive contamination on tick species. We sampled ticks from vegetation and large-sized wild mammals belonging to orders Carnivora and Artiodactyla at sites with 0.76, 1.91, and 4.50 mSv/hr ionizing radiation background values in the Polesky State Radio-Ecological Reserve of the Chernobyl nuclear disaster zone in spring 2010. Altogether, 122 questing ticks were collected from vegetation. Among collected ticks, Dermacentor reticulatus (Fabricius) was, by far, the most abundant species (99.2%), followed by Ixodes ricnus (L.) (0.8%), which was collected only at the 0.76 mSv/hr site. The average sex ratio female∶male was 2.9∶1.0. In parallel with the present study, we examined 3 Sus scrofa (L.), 2 Nyctereutes procyonoides (Gray), and 1 Alces alces (L.) at the 4.50 mSv/hr site; 96 D. reticulatus ticks were found on 2 N. procyonoides specimens. The mean density and the intensity of infestation were 16 ticks per animal and 48 ticks per infested animal, respectively. Future investigations are warranted to further characterize the role of various tick vectors, vertebrate reservoirs, and diversity of tick-borne pathogens in the Chernobyl exclusion zone.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAlces alces 3aDermacentor reticulatus 3aIxodes ricinus 3aNyctereutes procyonoides 3aSus scrofa 3aadults 3aionizing radiation 3amammals 3anuclear power 3apathogens 3apower plants 3asex ratio 3aspring 3aticks 3avegetation 3aEurope1 aDeriabina, T.1 aMorozov, A.1 aSitnicova, N.1 aToderas, I.1 aUspenskaia, I.1 aAlekhnovici, A.0 tJournal of parasitology.g2012 Aug., v. 98, no. 4 p.883-884dAmerican Society of Parasitologistsx0022-33957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1645%2FGE-3131.13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04037naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002800152245012500180300001400305520264700319592002802966650001402994650002003008650001903028650001303047650000903060650001703069650001103086650002303097650001103120650001303131650002303144650001603167650001703183650001303200651001003213653001903223653001103242653002003253653001703273653001103290700002203301700002103323773011503344856008703459852000903546655001203555IND60525483120221123041947.0190318e201601  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052548312DNAL7 a10.1016/j.applanim.2015.11.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSánchez, María José,10aGenetic study of stress assessed with infrared thermography during dressage competitions in the Pura Raza Español horse  ap. 58-65.  aDespite the fact that physiological parameters in dressage are important because of their close connection to human–horse accidents, performance and welfare, these parameters are only rarely included in horse breeding programs. In Spain, the Pura Raza Español horse (PRE) Breeding Program focuses mainly on the selection of horses for satisfactory dressage ability. Studying the genetic parameters of eye temperature (ET) using infrared thermography (IR) as an indicator of stress in horses could highlight the suitability of this parameter to be included as a selection criterion in the PRE Breeding Program. The aim of this study was to investigate the heritability of ET measured with IR in Young Horse Dressage tests (YHDT) from the Breeding Program. Accordingly, 343 PRE were measured during 3 YHDT final competitions held in Spain. From these animals, 1746 ET measurements were taken on 3 different moments during each competition: 3h before the competition (ET_B), just after the competition (<5min after the dressage exercise) (ET_JA), and 3h after the competition, when the animal was resting (ET_A). Moreover, 6 different dressage score records were taken for each animal during the competitions: walk, trot, canter, general impression, submission and total score. The genetic parameters were estimated using a Bayesian procedure. The environmental effects (Age, Stud, Trip, Training, Event-Year and Rider) that were statistically significant (p<0.05) for each temperature trait were used in the genetic models. The pedigree file included a total of 3350 PRE. The correlations between the ET and expected breeding values for dressage (EBV), as well as the coincidence between the animals’ genetic rankings by their EBV, were also studied. Heritabilities for temperature traits ranged from 0.14 (ET_JA) to 0.50 (ET_A), while heritabilities for performance traits ranged from 0.44 (walk) to 0.37 (submission) and repeatability ranged from 0.25 (ET_JA) to 0.79 (walk). The dressage EBV and the ET EBV just after exercise showed statistically significant correlations with r2=0.21. Finally, the range of matching animals was higher (from 17% to 40%) when the top 25% of the animals for both parameters was selected. Our findings indicate that the selection of the best animals for dressage performance would also involve selecting the animals with higher ET values, showing a higher level of physiological stress. Hence, despite selection using ET in horses is achievable, more evidence about its validity, sensitivity and specificity is still needed in order to include ET as an additional selection criteria in Breeding Programs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaccidents 3aanimal behavior 3abreeding value 3aexercise 3aeyes 3aheritability 3ahorses 3alivestock breeding 3amodels 3apedigree 3aselection criteria 3atemperature 3athermography 3atrotting 3aSpain 0aBreeding value 0aEquine 0aEye temperature 0aHeritability 0aStress1 aBartolomé, Ester1 aValera, Mercedes0 tApplied animal behaviour science.g2016 Jan., v. 174 p.58-65dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl35407x0168-15917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.applanim.2015.11.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03910naa a2200613 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003600111040001800147100002000165245010000185300001800285520200000303592002802303650001102331650001002342650001002352650001202362650001602374650002002390650001202410650004002422650001302462650002402475650001602499650001402515650006202529650002302591650001902614650005802633650002402691650001502715650001102730650002802741650002002769650001802789650002002807650001102827650005702838650005902895650002702954650002202981650000903003650003103012700001703043700002103060700002403081773012103105856004903226852000903275655001203284IND4471664720221123031240.0120727e201112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447166472DNAL7 a221176592pmid7 a10.1016/j.jada.2011.09.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHanson, Corrine10aVitamin D Status and Associations in Newborn Formula-Fed Infants during Initial Hospitalization  ap. 1836-1843.  aBACKGROUND: Evidence suggests that adequate vitamin D status in infancy plays a role in improving bone health and preventing disease, including type 1 diabetes, infections, and asthma. The objective of this study was to provide newborn hospitalized infants with American Academy of Pediatrics recommendations of 400 IU/day vitamin D-3 and measure the effect on serum 25(OH)D levels. DESIGN: This trial was conducted August 2009 to June 2010. Infants were randomized to a control were measured from cord blood, every 7 days, and at discharge. Intact parathyroid hormone was measured at discharge. PARTICIPANTS/SETTING: Fifty-two infants <32 weeks gestational age who received formula feedings during their neonatal intensive care unit hospitalization. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Patient characteristics for each treatment group were summarized using descriptive statistics. The Mann-Whitney test was used to compare continuous variables, and categorical variables were compared using the χ2 test or Fisher's exact test. The Pearson correlation coefficient was used to look at associations between continuous variables. RESULTS: The mean cord blood level for all participants was 17.6±7.0 ng/mL. White infants had significantly higher 25(OH)D levels than non-white infants (P=0.0003). The mean 25(OH)D level at discharge of the supplemented group was 23.1±7.0 ng/mL (57.66±17.47 nmol/L), the mean 25(OH)D level of the unsupplemented group was 17.8±4.7 ng/mL (44.43±11.3 nmol/L), (P=0.007). Serum 25(OH)D showed a positive correlation with serum calcium in the first week of life (r=0.44, P=0.003) and negative correlation with parathyroid hormone levels at discharge (r=−0.35, P=0.02). CONCLUSIONS: In newborn hospitalized infants, vitamin D-3 supplementation of 400 IU/day increased mean 25(OH)D levels from 17 ng/mL at birth to 23.1 ng/mL at discharge. Lower 25(OH)D levels were correlated with hypocalcemia during the first week of life, and elevated parathyroid hormone levels at discharge.  aPublisher supplied data 3aasthma 3ablood 3abones 3acalcium 3acorrelation 3agestational age 3ainfancy 3ainsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 3aneonates 3aparathyroid hormone 3aparturition 3avitamin D 2aBone Density Conservation Agentsxadministration & dosage 2aCalcifediolxblood 2aCalciumxblood 2aCholecalciferolxadministration & dosagexmetabolism. 2aDietary Supplements 2aEthnicity. 2aFemale 2aFetal Bloodxmetabolism 2aGestational Age 2aHealth Status 2aHospitalization 2aHumans 2aInfant Formulaxadministration & dosagexmetabolism. 2aInfant Nutritional Physiological Phenomenaxphysiology 2aInfant, Newbornxblood 2aInfant, Premature 2aMale 2aParathyroid Hormonexblood1 aArmas, Laura1 aLyden, Elizabeth1 aAnderson-Berry, Ann0 tJournal of the American Dietetic Association.g2011 Dec., v. 111, no. 12 p.1836-1843dElsevier Inc.x0002-82237nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jada.2011.09.010  aDNAL 7aarticle03364naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002200148245013100170300001600301520162800317592002801945650002001973650001601993650000902009650001802018650001802036650001302054650001102067650002102078650001602099650002002115650001802135650001202153650001002165650001702175650001102192650004302203650001202246650002202258650002002280650001602300650002502316700001902341700001702360700001902377700002102396700001902417700002002436700001802456700002202474700001802496700002202514700001902536773011602555856008202671852000902753655001202762IND60749143920221116162009.0210828e202109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074914392DNAL7 a10.1007/s11418-021-01537-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKashiwada, Mayumi10aAnalysis of anti-obesity and anti-diabetic effects of acacia bark-derived proanthocyanidins in type 2 diabetes model KKAy mice  ap. 893-906.  aThe acacia bark extract derived from Acacia mearnsii De Wild is rich in proanthocyanidins, whose constituent units are robinetinidol, fisetinidol, catechin, and gallocatechin. In this study, we examined the effect of proanthocyanidins on obesity and diabetes using KKAy mice, a type 2 diabetes model. KKAy mice were fed either a low-fat diet, a high-fat diet, or a high-fat diet mixed with an acacia bark extract, a proanthocyanidins fraction, and other fraction for 7 weeks. Monitoring the changes in the body weight revealed that acacia bark extract and proanthocyanidins fraction could prevent excessive weight gain resulting from a high-fat diet. In addition, increases in the fasting blood glucose level due to high-fat diet intake were found to be suppressed by acacia bark extract and proanthocyanidins fraction. Furthermore, proanthocyanidins derived from acacia bark were found to increase the expression of adiponectin in white adipose tissue, which enhances the action of insulin. In addition, acacia bark-derived proanthocyanidins suppressed gluconeogenesis and fatty acid synthesis in the liver, as well as suppressing the decrease in energy production under pathological conditions in skeletal muscle. In addition, acacia bark-derived proanthocyanidins showed AMPK activation and DPP-4 inhibitory action. Therefore, it was suggested that acacia bark-derived proanthocyanidins lowered fasting blood glucose levels through the above mechanism. These results suggest that proanthocyanidins derived from acacia bark are the active ingredients of the anti-obesity and anti-diabetic effects of acacia bark extract.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcacia mearnsii 3aadiponectin 3abark 3abark extracts 3ablood glucose 3acatechin 3aenergy 3aepigallocatechin 3afatty acids 3agluconeogenesis 3ahigh fat diet 3ainsulin 3aliver 3alow fat diet 3amodels 3anoninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 3aobesity 3aproanthocyanidins 3askeletal muscle 3aweight gain 3awhite adipose tissue1 aNakaishi, Saho1 aUsuda, Ayumi1 aMiyahara, Yumi1 aKatsumoto, Kenta1 aKatsura, Kyoko1 aTerakado, Izumi1 aJindo, Makiko1 aNakajima, Shihori1 aOgawa, Sosuke1 aSugiyama, Kiyoshi1 aOchiai, Wataru0 tNatural medicines.g2021 Sept., v. 75, no. 4 p.893-906dSpringer SingaporewJournal:jnl4059015x1340-34437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11418-021-01537-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02045naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094024003200123040001800155100002800173245007700201506007600278506003100354506002800385506005400413520055000467592002801017596004701045596000901092506003701101650002201138650002601160650002301186650002101209650002101230650001201251650001601263650001701279650003101296650001701327650001501344651001801359700002001377773010501397856007601502852000901578655001201587IND60736797220221207124816.0220901e20190101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073679722DNAL7 a10.1093/jipm/pmz0242doi7 a10.1093/jipm/pmz0242chorus  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRoyer, T.

Up to 80% of patients receiving radiotherapy will develop acute radiation induced diarrhea. The primary aim of this randomized double blind controlled trial is to evaluate the effect of the probiotic Bifilact® on moderate and severe treatment-induced diarrhea during pelvic radiation.Patients with pelvic cancers were treated between 2006 and 2010 at L'Hôtel-Dieu de Québec, University Health Center. Some patients had surgery before pelvic radiotherapy and some received chemotherapy. A total of 246 Patients were randomized between a placebo and either of two regiments of double strain Bifilact® probiotics (Lactobacillus acidophilus LAC-361 and Bifidobacterium longum BB-536): a standard dose twice a day (1.3 billion CFU) or a high dose three times a day (10 billion CFU). Patients were trained to record their digestive symptoms daily with a standardized scale and they met a registered dietician and radiation oncologist every week during treatment. The main analysis compared time to first appearance of grade ≥2–3–4 diarrhea using Kaplan–Meier curves as measured by proportion of patients without moderate and severe diarrhea.229 patients were analyzed. The difference between the groups for overall grade 2–3–4 diarrhea was not statistically significant (p = 0.13). However at 60 days, the proportion of patients without moderate and severe diarrhea in the standard dose group (35%) was more than twice as high as that of the placebo group (17%) with a hazard ratio of 0.69 (p = 0.04). In patients who had surgery, the standard probiotics dose group had a better proportion of patients without very severe diarrhea than the placebo group, respectively 97% and 74% (p = 0.03). In all groups, the average number of bowel movements per day during treatment was less than 3 soft stools (p = 0.80) and the median abdominal pain less than 1 based on the National Cancer Institute scale (p = 0.23).Standard dose of Bifilact® may reduce radiation induced grade 2–3–4 diarrhea at the end of the treatment of patients with pelvic cancer. In patients operated on before RT, a standard dose of probiotics may reduce radiation induced grade 4 diarrhea. Nutritional interventions by a registered dietician seemed to reduce global digestive symptoms. Trial Registration: clinicaltrials.gov.

The Arrhenius model and the radial basis function neural network (RBFNN) model were established to predict changes in the quality of shrimp during storage. Quality of shrimp stored at −12°C changed more quickly during 56–112 days, but those stored at −28°C deteriorated slowly during the entire storage period. Additionally, the indicators SEP, EC, and SA all fitted to the Arrhenius model well (relative errors within ±10%), but this model did not perform well in the prediction of K-value, Hx, and TVB-N on some days. However, the RBFNN model showed excellent accuracy for all indicators (relative errors within ±0.5%). The RBFNN model performed better than the Arrhenius model in predicting the quality of shrimp stored at −28°C to −12°C.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSolenocera 3aelectrical conductivity 3ahypoxanthine 3aneural networks 3aprediction 3asensory evaluation 3ashrimp 3astorage time 3atotal volatile basic nitrogen 0aArrhenius model 0aFrozen Storage 0aPrediction 0aQuality Change 0aRadial basis function neural network model 0aShrimp1 aLiu, Xiaochang1 aWang, Huiyi1 aHong, Hui1 aLuo, Yongkang0 tInternational journal of food properties.g2017 Nov. 2, v. 20, no. 11 p.2711-2723dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl56717x1094-29127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10942912.2016.12482923Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03363naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002800148245012600176300001600302520175900318592002802077650001402105650001802119650001502137650001602152650001302168650002402181650001302205650001902218650002102237650001702258650002302275650001502298650001202313650002302325650001302348650002402361650003102385653002202416653001702438653002602455700002702481700003502508700003302543700002502576700004302601773011002644856008202754852000902836655001202845IND60600289920221123025709.0180703e201410  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060028992DNAL7 a10.1016/j.clnu.2013.10.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFerreira, Lívia Garcia10aHyper- and hypometabolism are not related to nutritional status of patients on the waiting list for liver transplantation  ap. 754-760.  aMetabolic disorders and malnutrition are well known conditions reported in patients with liver disease (LD), but the relationship between them are underexplored. So, the aim of this study was to assess the resting energy expenditure (REE) of these patients, identifying the prevalence of hyper- and hypometabolism. In addition, to evaluate whether malnutrition and clinical variables were associated with REE and metabolic disorders.The REE was measured by indirect calorimetry and predicted by the Harris and Benedict formula (REEHB). Nutritional status was assessed by different methods. The etiology, severity and complications of LD were also evaluated.A total of 81 patients were assessed. The measured REE was 1587.5 ± 426.6 kcal. The REE was overestimated by the REEHB (REE:REEHB <0.8) in 7.4% and underestimated (REE:REEHB >1.2) in 24.7% of the patients. The REE was lower in malnourished patients (p < 0.05). However, hyper- and hypometabolism were not associated with nutritional status (p > 0.05). The REE and hypermetabolism were not associated with LD, but hypometabolic patients had a higher prevalence of Child C, and had higher values for MELD, INR and total bilirubin (p < 0.05). After multiple regression analyses, the REE was significantly associated (p < 0.05) with intracellular body water, arm muscle area and serum glucose. Serum glucose was only significantly associated (p < 0.05) with hypermetabolism, and INR with hypometabolism.Changes in resting metabolism are present but not universal. The hypermetabolism was associated with extrahepatic factors, and hypometabolism with the severity of LD. Under these conditions in the clinical setting, calculated energy requirements using the HB formula should be adjusted.  aPublisher supplied data 3abilirubin 3ablood glucose 3abody water 3acalorimetry 3achildren 3aenergy requirements 3aetiology 3aliver diseases 3aliver transplant 3amalnutrition 3ametabolic diseases 3ametabolism 3amuscles 3anutritional status 3apatients 3aregression analysis 3aresting energy expenditure 0aEnergy metabolism 0aMalnutrition 0aLiver transplantation1 aSantos, Laís Ferreira1 aSilva, Thayná Ribeiro Neri da1 aAnastácio, Lucilene Rezende1 aLima, Agnaldo Soares1 aCorreia, Maria Isabel Toulson Davisson0 tClinical nutrition.g2014 Oct., v. 33, no. 5 p.754-760dElsevier LtdwJournal:J000000059x0261-56147nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.clnu.2013.10.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle05539naa a2200661 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002000149245013500169520351900304592002803823596008903851650001403940650000803954650001603962650002703978650001604005650001004021650002704031650001204058650001704070650001004087650001604097650000904113650001504122650001204137650001104149650000904160650001004169650002504179650001504204650001404219650003004233650001804263650002604281650001004307650002204317650000904339650001804348650001604366650001604382650001204398651001304410653002504423700005804448700005804506700001704564700001904581700001304600700005604613773010404669856008304773852000904856655001204865IND60711568320221121124227.0200928e202010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071156832DNAL7 a10.1094/PDIS-03-20-0524-PDN2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRusinque, L. C.10aFirst Report of Pratylenchus penetrans (Nematoda: Pratylenchidae) Associated with Amaryllis (Hippeastrum × hybridum), in Portugal  aThe world flower business is a highly dynamic industry and in Portugal yields around EUR 500 million a year (INE 2013). Root lesion nematodes (RLNs), Pratylenchus spp., are considered the third most important group of plant parasitic nematodes (PPNs) worldwide due to their large distribution, wide host range, and impact on economically important crops (Castillo and Vovlas 2007). The most recent report of RLNs parasitizing amaryllis (Hippeastrum spp.) was the amaryllis lesion nematode, Pratylenchus hippeastri, in Florida (U.S.A.) (Gozel et al. 2007). In 2016, soil and root samples of amaryllis hybrid Hippeastrum × hybridum cv. Benfica were collected from potted plants produced in greenhouses in Montijo (Setúbal Peninsula, Central Portugal), 50 km from Lisbon. Nematodes were extracted from soil samples according to the protocol PM 7/119 (1) (EPPO 2013) and identified to genus level based on morphometrical traits of 10 females and 11 males. DNA extraction was conducted from 10 nematodes separately, followed by PCR amplification and sequencing of the D2/D3 expansion segment of the 28S rRNA and 18S rRNA genes using the primers D2A and D3B (Nadler et al. 1999) and 1813F and 2646R (Holterman et al. 2006). The nucleotide sequences were deposited as MN756841 and MN756509 at the NCBI. RLNs were detected in all five samples in a concentration of around 100 nematodes/100 cm³ of soil. Some primary roots of affected plants showed small, elliptical, reddish-brown lesions and poor growth. More severely affected plants presented stunted, chlorotic foliage and had the cortical lesions enlarged to the point that rotting was severe and many roots were easily detached from the bulb; in some cases, there was not emergence from bulbs. The female body was moderately slender, almost straight when killed by gentle heat, lateral field with four straight lines, body annules distinct, lip with three annules, stylet knobs round, median bulb round, spermatheca round and filled with sperm, tail tapering to rounded terminus, sometimes with two striae. Body length was 558.99 ± 48.50 μm, body width 22.45 ± 2.02 μm, stylet length 18.52 ± 1.02 μm, and tail length 32.91 ± 7.50 μm. Values of a, c, and c′ ratios were 25.95 ± 2.53, 17.62 ± 3.45, and 38.49 ± 4.42; V (%) value was 80.92 ± 1.69. Males were smaller than females with body length 511.37 ± 29.90 μm, stylet length 17.55 ± 1.04 μm, and spicule length 18.53 ± 1.17 μm. No other PPN was found in the suspensions extracted from the soil samples. BLAST hits showed that partial sequence of D2/D3 rRNA loci (540 bp) was 96.2% identical (e-value 0.0) to Pratylenchus penetrans isolate MU2 (KP161612) and voucher T143 (KY828357). The partial sequence of 18S rRNA (650 bp) was 100% identical to P. penetrans isolate ILVO-Pp (MH983023) and 99.81% to P. penetrans Praty-A (AB661627). In the corresponding phylogenetic trees, both P. penetrans sequences clustered together with other species from the penetrans group (P. fallax, P. convallariae, and P. oleae) with good support (Janssen et al. 2017). Nevertheless, although all species within this group share many morphological characteristics (Subbotin et al. 2008), our specimens presented higher similarity, both morphological and molecular, with P. penetrans. So far, this RLN has been found associated mainly with potato fields in Portugal (Abrantes et al. 1987; Esteves et al. 2015); thus, to our knowledge, this is the first report of P. penetrans parasitizing amaryllis, in Portugal.  aPublisher supplied data  aUID/AGR/04129/2019 (LEAF)cFundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia (FCT), Portugal 3aAmaryllis 3aDNA 3aHippeastrum 3aPratylenchus penetrans 3abody length 3abulbs 3acontainer-grown plants 3afemales 3afloriculture 3agenes 3agreenhouses 3aheat 3ahost range 3ahybrids 3aleaves 3aloci 3amales 3anucleotide sequences 3aparasitism 3aphylogeny 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aribosomal RNA 3aroot lesion nematodes 3aroots 3asequence analysis 3asoil 3asoil sampling 3aspermatheca 3aspermatozoa 3astylets 3aPortugal 0aroot lesion nematode1 aVicente, C.

The melting of free metal nanoparticles starts from their surfaces. However, in the current work, a different pattern of melting points of gold nanoparticles confined between two-layer graphene nanosheets (two-layer GNSs) was observed based on molecular dynamics simulations. The simulations indicated a decrease in the melting temperature with an increasing length of the confined gold nanoparticle. This relationship can be explained by the melting mechanism revealed from results of a Lindemann index analysis and the confining effect of the two-layer GNS.  aPublisher supplied data 3agraphene 3amelting 3amelting point 3amolecular dynamics 3ananogold 3ananoparticles 3ananosheets 3asimulation models1 aWu, Nanhua1 aWang, Jinjian1 aShao, Jingling1 aZhu, Xiaolei1 aLu, Xiaohua1 aGuo, Lucun0 tRSC advances.g2016 Nov. 14, v. 6, no. 110 p.108343-108346dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c6ra12119e3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03367naa a2200709 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003800113040001800151100002200169245016100191300001600352520122500368592002801593650002101621650002501642650001301667650001501680650001901695650001201714650001101726650000901737650001601746650001001762650001201772650001301784650001901797650001801816650002001834650002301854650001101877650001401888650001001902650001101912650002001923650001201943650004401955650004201999650001102041650004102052650003202093650000902125650003802134650002502172650003902197653001502236653002002251653001902271653002202290653001502312700002202327700002102349700001802370700001902388700002402407773012002431856008502551852000902636655001202645IND50060221320221119220231.0190401e20130116xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006022132DNAL7 a229637132pmid7 a10.1016/j.vetpar.2012.08.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZimmer, Jean-Yves10aChemical composition of silage residues sustaining the larval development of the Culicoides obsoletus/Culicoides scoticus species (Diptera: Ceratopogonidae)  ap. 197-201.  aCulicoides (Diptera: Ceratopogonidae) are biological vectors of bluetongue virus (BTV). Bluetongue is a viral disease that affects domestic and wild ruminants. Since its recent emergence in northern Europe, this disease has caused considerable economic losses to the sheep and cattle industry. The biotopes, and more particularly the chemical characteristics which are suitable for larval development of the main vector species, are still relatively unknown. This study shows that the larvae of biting midges belonging to the species Culicoides obsoletus and Culicoides scoticus are able to breed in different types of silage residue (maize, grass, sugar beet pulp and their combinations). The chemical composition of substrates strongly influences the presence of the immature stages of these biting midges. Higher lignin and insoluble fibre contents seem to favour their presence and could play the role of a physical support for semi-aquatic larvae. In contrast, higher concentrations of magnesium and calcium are negatively correlated with the presence of these two species. These data will help to locate and monitor the breeding sites of these species and could contribute to the control of these insects on farms.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBluetongue virus 3aCulicoides obsoletus 3abiotopes 3abluetongue 3abreeding sites 3acalcium 3acattle 3acorn 3acorrelation 3afarms 3agrasses 3aindustry 3ainsect control 3ainsect larvae 3ainsoluble fiber 3alarval development 3alignin 3amagnesium 3asheep 3asilage 3asugar beet pulp 2aAnimals 2aBeta vulgarisxchemistryxparasitology. 2aCeratopogonidaexgrowth & development 2aFemale 2aInsect Vectorsxgrowth & development 2aLarvaxgrowth & development 2aMale 2aPoaceaexchemistryxparasitology. 2aSilagexparasitology 2aZea maysxchemistryxparasitology. 0aCulicoides 0aSilage residues 0aBreeding sites 0aObsoletus complex 0aBluetongue1 aSaegerman, Claude1 aLosson, Bertrand1 aBeckers, Yves1 aHaubruge, Eric1 aFrancis, Frédéric0 tVeterinary parasitology.g2013 Jan. 16, v. 191, no. 1-2 p.197-201dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl11815x0304-40177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetpar.2012.08.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02955naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245010800165300001600273520154800289592002801837650002001865650001501885650001701900650001801917650000901935650001201944650001501956650002501971650002001996650001602016651001002032653002002042653002302062653001302085653002002098653001802118700001702136700001502153700001702168700001802185700001702203700001302220700001402233773012302247856008202370852000902452655001202461IND60740549020221120044838.0211227e202202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074054902DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jes.2021.05.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Feipeng12aA synthetical methodology for identifying priority pollutants in reclaimed water based on meta-analysis  ap. 106-114.  aWastewater reclamation and reuse is an increasing global project, while the reclamation treatment on wastewater does not completely remove all pollutants in water. The residual pollutants in reclaimed water would cause potential risk on human health and ecosystem safety during the long-term use. It is impossible to analyze and control all pollutants one by one in practice, therefore, identification and control of priority pollutants will be efficient strategy to ensure the safe use of reclaimed water. An integrated three-step methodology for identifying priority pollutants in reclaimed water was proposed in this study. First, a comprehensive literature survey on the occurrence of pollutants in reclaimed water was conducted, and a dataset DPR for pollutants occurrence in reclaimed water was established, containing 1,113 pollutants. Second, 611 chemicals that had been recommended as hazardous pollutants for various water bodies in previous literatures were summarized, and a dataset DHP for hazardous pollutants in water was obtained. Third, meta-analysis on these two datasets (DPR and DHP) was performed, a new dataset DHPR for hazardous pollutants in reclaimed water was established, including 265 candidates. Finally, 59 substances out of dataset DHPR were identified as priority pollutants for reclaimed water based on their recommendation frequency. It is expected that this synthetical methodology will provide powerful support for scientific evaluating and managing water pollution and ensuring safe use of reclaimed water.  aPublisher supplied data 3adata collection 3aecosystems 3ahuman health 3ameta-analysis 3arisk 3asurveys 3awastewater 3awastewater treatment 3awater pollution 3awater reuse 3aChina 0aReclaimed water 0aPriority pollutant 0aSafe use 0aRisk assessment 0aMeta-analysis1 aWei, Dongbin1 aChen, Miao1 aPeng, Shuang1 aGuo, Qiaorong1 aZhang, Xinyi1 aLiu, Jun1 aDu, Yuguo0 tJournal of environmental sciences (China).g2022 Feb., v. 112 p.106-114dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12417x1001-07427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jes.2021.05.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02808naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005400148245008200202300001600284520133000300592002801630650001101658650001001669650001801679650001901697650001901716650001301735650001801748650003401766650001701800650001101817650001801828650002301846650002501869650001201894650001501906650000901921650001901930653002201949653001801971653001201989653001702001700002002018700001702038700001302055700002102068773011002089856008202199852000902281655001202290IND60600290120221121003602.0180703e201410  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060029012DNAL7 a10.1016/j.clnu.2013.10.0182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShi, Zumin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3099-329910aMonosodium glutamate intake is inversely related to the risk of hyperglycemia  ap. 823-828.  aIn animal studies, monosodium glutamate (MSG) intake at a particular age has been found to increase the risk of insulin resistance and obesity. Inconsistent associations between MSG intake and overweight have been reported in humans. No population study has assessed the association between MSG intake and diabetes risk. This study aims to prospectively examine the association between MSG intake and hyperglycemia in a Chinese population.We followed 1056 healthy adults aged 20 years and older from 2002 to 2007. Dietary data were collected during home visits using a 3-day food record and a food frequency questionnaire. Fasting blood samples were collected at baseline and follow up. Hyperglycemia was defined as fasting plasma glucose >5.6 mmol/l.During the follow-up we identified 125 cases of hyperglycemia. The highest quartile of MSG intake was associated with a lower risk of incident hyperglycemia, even after adjustment for a number of covariates, including dietary patterns. Comparing the highest with the lowest quartiles of MSG intake, the odds ratio (OR) for hyperglycemia was 0.30 (95% CI 0.13–0.66). There was a linear inverse association between MSG intake and change in blood glucose.This cohort study suggests that high MSG intake is associated with a decreased risk of hyperglycemia in Chinese adults.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadults 3ablood 3ablood glucose 3ablood sampling 3acohort studies 3adiabetes 3aeating habits 3afood frequency questionnaires 3afood records 3ahumans 3ahyperglycemia 3ainsulin resistance 3amonosodium glutamate 3aobesity 3aodds ratio 3arisk 3arisk reduction 0aDietary glutamate 0aHyperglycemia 0aChinese 0aCohort study1 aTaylor, Anne W.1 aYuan, Baojun1 aZuo, Hui1 aWittert, Gary A.0 tClinical nutrition.g2014 Oct., v. 33, no. 5 p.823-828dElsevier LtdwJournal:J000000059x0261-56147nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.clnu.2013.10.0183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03123naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100006400151245013500215300001600350520170800366592002802074650002502102650001402127650002402141650001402165650002602179650002302205651001502228653001402243653002202257653002602279653001302305653001402318700002202332700001602354700001802370700005902388700006302447773009602510856008602606852000902692655001202701IND60721913020221119180625.0210527e20210122xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072191302DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vaccine.2020.12.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aThangarajah, Dharshi1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9477-346610aEffectiveness of quadrivalent influenza vaccination in the first year of a funded childhood program in Queensland, Australia, 2018  ap. 729-737.  aFollowing high influenza activity in 2017, the state of Queensland, Australia, funded a quadrivalent inactivated influenza vaccination program for children aged 6 months to <5 years in 2018. We calculated influenza vaccine effectiveness (VE) among children eligible for this program.A matched case-control study was conducted. Cases were identified using Queensland 2018 influenza notification data among children age-eligible for funded vaccination. Controls were drawn from Australian Immunisation Register records of Queensland resident children age-eligible for funded influenza vaccine. Up to 10 controls per case were matched for location and birthdate. First dose vaccination was valid if received ≥14 days prior to specimen collection; a second dose was valid if received ≥28 days after first dose receipt. VE was calculated for vaccine doses and adherence to national recommendations for two doses in the first season (schedule completeness) and adjusted (VEₐdⱼ) for sex and First Nations status.There were 1,125 cases and 10,645 matched controls analysed. Overall VEₐdⱼ against laboratory-confirmed influenza was 51% (95% confidence interval (CI) 41–60). VEₐdⱼ was 60% (95% CI 46–70) for children who received two doses in 2018, and 60% (95% CI 48–69) for children vaccinated appropriately according to schedule completeness. VE increased with age.Moderate vaccine effectiveness was observed for children eligible for the funded program in Queensland in 2018, adding to the sparse evidence for influenza vaccine use in Australian children. Adhering to the national first season two dose schedule for influenza vaccine receipt in children ensures maximum protection.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase-control studies 3achildhood 3aconfidence interval 3ainfluenza 3ainfluenza vaccination 3ainfluenza vaccines 3aQueensland 0aInfluenza 0aInfluenza vaccine 0aVaccine effectiveness 0aChildren 0aAustralia1 aMalo, Jonathan A.1 aField, Emma1 aAndrews, Ross1 aWare, Robert S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6129-67361 aLambert, Stephen B.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2709-193X0 tVaccine.g2021 Jan. 22, v. 39, no. 4 p.729-737dElsevier LtdwJournal:6210x0264-410X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2020.12.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01825naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002200164245008200186300001600268520063300284592002800917650001300945650001600958650001500974650001500989650001001004650001001014650001901024650002101043650001801064650002501082650001201107650003101119650003701150650002701187700001901214700001701233773009601250856004801346852000901394655001201403IND4451426320221117171418.0121003e201104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445142632DNAL7 a211841342pmid7 a10.1007/s10529-010-0507-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChoi, Jin-dal-rae10aPerformance of microbial fuel cell with volatile fatty acids from food wastes  ap. 705-714.  aFood wastes were used as feedstock for the direct production of electricity in a microbial fuel cell (MFC).

In general, the co-existence of other, different VFAs slowed the removal of each VFA, which indicated that anodic microbes were competing for different substrates. 16S rRNA gene analysis using PCR-DGGE indicated that the MFC operation with VFAs had enriched unique microbial species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetates 3aelectricity 3afeedstocks 3afood waste 3afuels 3agenes 3amicroorganisms 3apower generation 3aribosomal RNA 3avolatile fatty acids 2aAnimals 2aBioelectric Energy Sources 2aFatty Acids, Volatilexchemistry 2aMedical Waste Disposal1 aChang, Ho-nam,1 aHan, Jong-In0 tBiotechnology letters.g2011 Apr., v. 33, no. 4 p.705-714dSpringer-Verlagx0141-54927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10529-010-0507-2  aDNAL 7aarticle02804naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001700139245007900156300001600235520167200251592002801923650000901951650000901960650001601969650000901985650001101994650001102005650000802016650001102024650002002035650002302055650002402078653001602102653001702118653001002135653001302145653001002158773014402168856007302312852000902385655001202394IND60681641720221120140850.0200117e20190618xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068164172DNAL7 a10.3920/CEP1800522doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMarlin, D.J.10aEvaluation of the cooling efficacy of different equine leg cooling methods  ap. 113-122.  aThe use of cold therapy or cryotherapy is widespread in human and veterinary medicine and sports medicine and ranges from focal, localised treatment to whole body treatment. In equestrian sport, a variety of methods and commercial products exist for cooling the lower limbs. To date, there have been no studies comparing the relative efficacy of these different cooling methods. Due to the difficulty in standardising techniques for comparing cooling on live horses, a repeatable laboratory method for determining cooling efficacy was developed using a metal flask. The amount of heat removed from the flask by different traditional methods (corrected for the heat lost over 30 min for the flask without treatment) and a variety of commercial cooling products was calculated by measuring the decrease in temperature (in triplicate) within the flask from an initial external temperature of 40.2±0.4 °C and an internal temperature of 42.1±0.9 °C (mean ± standard deviation) over 30 min. The methods compared were: cold hosing (15 °C), standing in ice and water (0 °C), ice-cube packs, instant cold-packs, ice boots, evaporative (water) cooled boots, ice gel and clay. The greatest amount of heat removed in 30 min was 134±4 kJ for standing in ice & water (0 °C). The next highest rates of removal were 66.4±1.3, 57.1±6.1 and 56.9±1.3 kJ for cold hosing (15 °C), Ice Horse (-23 °C) and Cryochaps (-23 °C), respectively. The lowest amount of heat removed was for covered clay (8±1 kJ; initial clay temperature 15 °C). This approach allows different methods of cooling to be compared without the difficulties encountered in standardisation in live horses.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclay 3acold 3acryosurgery 3agels 3ahorses 3ahumans 3aice 3asports 3asports medicine 3astandard deviation 3aveterinary medicine 0acryotherapy 0acold-therapy 0ahorse 0ain vitro 0amodel0 tComparative exercise physiology.g2019 June 18, v. 15, no. 2 p.113-122dWageningen Academic PublisherswJournal:J000000061x1755-25597nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3920/CEP1800523Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03557naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002300094024003200117024003500149040001800184100002800202245013800230520171700368592002802085596003402113596001902147596000902166596001002175650002402185650002702209650002102236650002602257650002802283650001402311650002002325650001502345650000902360650001002369650002802379650001102407650001202418650002202430650001302452650001202465650001302477650003902490650002502529650001102554700002902565700002302594700002202617700002002639773009302659856011402752856007902866961001302945852000902958655001202967IND60736798020221118013628.0220901e20200701xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073679802DNAL7 a10113/73679802hdl7 a10.1093/jisesa/ieaa0712doi7 a10.1093/jisesa/ieaa0712chorus  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMattison, Christopher P10aCloning, Expression, and Immunological Characterization of Formosan Subterranean Termite (Blattodea: Rhinotermitidae) Arginine Kinase  aSeveral parts of the world regularly consume termites. Arthropod arginine kinase proteins often cross-react with human immunoblobulin E (IgE) antibodies and they are considered pan-allergens. The Formosan subterranean termite Coptotermes formosanus (C. formosanus (Shiraki) [Isoptera: Rhinotermitidae]), along with cockroaches, belong to the order Blattodea and they are common household pests in tropical and subtropical parts of the world. An sodium dodecyl sulfate–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) band migrating at approximately 37 kDa in C. formosanus termite extracts cross-reacted with IgE from five cockroach allergic patient samples by immunoblot. Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis of gel slices from the corresponding region of a gel indicated several peptides from the excised region were identical to the American cockroach arginine kinase allergen, Per a 9. The sequence of the full-length C. formosanus arginine kinase gene indicates the protein it encodes is 96% identical to American cockroach Per a 9, 94% identical to German cockroach Bla g 9, and 82–84% identical to shrimp arginine kinase proteins Pen m 2, Lit v 2, and Cra c 2. Full-length C. formosanus arginine kinase was fused to a glutathione S-transferase tag and recombinantly expressed and purified from Escherichia coli by affinity chromatography. The recombinant protein was recognized by IgE from 11 of 12 cockroach or shrimp allergic samples, but did not cross-react with dust mite allergic or peanut/tree nut allergic samples. The results of this study indicate the C. formosanus arginine kinase cross-reacts with cockroach and shrimp allergic IgE, and if consumed would likely act as an allergen.  aPublisher supplied data  cAgricultural Research Service  cU.S. Air Force  cUSDA  cUSDOD 3aBlattella germanica 3aCoptotermes formosanus 3aEscherichia coli 3aPeriplaneta americana 3aaffinity chromatography 3aallergens 3aarginine kinase 3adust mites 3agels 3agenes 3aglutathione transferase 3ahumans 3ainsects 3amass spectrometry 3apatients 3apeanuts 3apeptides 3apolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 3arecombinant proteins 3ashrimp1 aTungtrongchitr, Anchalee1 aTille, Katherine S1 aCottone, Carrie B1 aRiegel, Claudia0 tJournal of Insect Science.dOxford University Press (OUP)wJournal:2179x1536-24427nnas40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/73679803Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jisesa/ieaa0713Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle01788naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001400151245015700165300001600322520066900338592002801007650002701035650001701062650001501079650001801094650001401112650001301126651001201139651001801151700001601169700001601185700001601201700001801217773009601235856008601331852000901417655001201426IND60721913120221119180739.0210527e20210122xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072191312DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vaccine.2020.12.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCox, A.D.10aProceedings of a workshop to discuss the epidemiology of invasive Haemophilus influenzae disease with emphasis on serotype a and b in the Americas, 2019  ap. 627-632.  aOn March 9, 2019, a one-day workshop titled “The current epidemiology of invasive Haemophilus influenzae disease in the Americas”, jointly organized by the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC), the Canadian Institute of Health Research (CIHR), and the National Research Council Canada (NRC), brought together experts in the epidemiology and surveillance of invasive Haemophilus influenzae (Hi) disease from the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) and its five regional reference laboratories in South America, USA, and Canada in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada.

The protein content of treated (high-protein, low GI) rice flour was about 3.5 times higher than untreated rice flour, suggesting its use in infant formula or other protein-fortified food products. The GI of untreated and treated rice flour was found to be 88.0 ± 0.2 and 46.1 ± 0.2, respectively. High-protein, low-GI rice flour was studied for thermal and structural properties, which showed significant (p < 0.05) differences from untreated rice flour. The results of thermal properties showed a decrease in transition temperatures and enthalpy of gelatinization. The ratio of peaks at 1045 cm ⁻¹ and 1015 cm ⁻¹ of treated rice flour was significantly (p <0.05) lower than that of untreated rice flour. This could be ascribed to the loss of crystallinity due to enzymatic degradation. These results further support the decrease in transition temperatures and enthalpy of gelatinization. The results of the rheological studies of high-protein, low-GI rice flour revealed that both untreated and treated rice flour samples exhibited non-Newtonian shear-thinning flow behaviour (n < 1), which is characterized by a decrease in viscosity with an increase in shear rate.  aPublisher supplied data 3acrystal structure 3aenthalpy 3aenzymatic hydrolysis 3agelatinization 3aglycemic index 3ainfant formulas 3aprotein content 3arice flour 3atemperature 3athermal properties 3aviscosity 0aGlycaemic index 0aShear-thinning 0aDifferential Scanning Calorimetry 0aFourier-transform Infrared Spectroscopy1 aNaik, H.

Monitoring current climate change demands a historical perspective, as much as possible, and framing a baseline climate data is important for establishing a reference point to assess climate change. Thus, the study of past climate change relies critically on the availability of datasets that characterize the climate of the region. In this context, the objective of this article is to provide climate portfolio (collection of climate information) of Pichavaram mangrove region of Tamil Nadu coast, India, and to give an outline of its predicted impacts. Climate data of the past 60 years have been collected, and the trend analysis of major climatic variables such as temperature, rainfall, relative humidity and wind speed has been studied statistically. This research article critically appraises the available climate data, identifies general patterns of climate change in the coastal region and highlights the gaps in existing knowledge on the impact of climate change at the local level. It gives a holistic approach on understanding climate at local level and provides baseline climate information. This, in turn, is expected to shore up in framing suitable adaptation strategies and policies for the coastal region with the most valuable ecosystem such as mangroves.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3acoasts 3adata collection 3aecosystems 3aissues and policy 3amonitoring 3aplanning 3arain 3arelative humidity 3atemperature 3awind speed 3aIndia 0aclimate 0aportfolio 0acoast 0amangroves 0aimpacts 0aadaptation 0apolicies1 aRamachandran, A.1 aMalini, P.1 aPalanivelu, K.0 tJournal of integrative environmental sciences.g2014 Oct. 2, v. 11, no. 3-4 p.173-186dTaylor & Francisx1943-81687nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/1943815X.2014.9757243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01689naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100002600137245004000163300001600203520084800219592002801067650001601095650001101111650002201122650001501144650001901159650001301178700002101191773009501212856007101307852000901378655001201387IND60518568120221118220604.0160418e197305  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051856812DNAL7 a10.2307/19353432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPilson, Michael E.

These concentrations did not vary in proportion to the photosynthesis and respiration activities of the reef community. There were no detectable changes in either form of phosphorus between upstream and downstream ends of a transect across a relatively rich coral region, but on a transect across a predominantly algal—covered area there was a slight decrease in reactive phosphorus and a slight increase in organic phosphorus. There were no detectable diurnal variations in these patterns. This remarkable constancy suggests that the plants take up phosphorus at a nearly constant rate, regardless of the magnitude of photosynthetic activity.  aPublisher supplied data 3acoral reefs 3acorals 3adiurnal variation 3aphosphorus 3aphotosynthesis 3aseawater1 aBetzer, Susan B.0 tEcology.g1973 May, v. 54, no. 3 p.581-588dEcological Society of Americax0012-96587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2307/19353433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01405naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245009700171300001600268520036100284592002800645650001200673650001700685650001100702650001200713650001000725650001600735651000900751653001300760653001600773653000900789653001500798700002400813773011200837856008500949852000901034655001201043IND60515424820221118060629.0160315e20160402xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051542482DNAL7 a10.1080/01647954.2016.11419842doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNemati, Alireza12aA new species of Allogamasellus Athias-Henriot (Acari: Mesostigmata: Ologamasidae) from Iran  ap. 153-158.  aAllogamasellus castilhoi sp. nov .

Analytical results show that new diesel vehicle, LPG vehicle, and biodiesel vehicle are the most beneficial options (zero-cost options) for government policy, and subsidy is unnecessary because the public will purchase as long as they realize the high fuel efficiency and low pollution emission. The high cost–benefit ratio of hybrid vehicle (HV) means that HV is the most expensive alternative. However, the cost–benefit ratio < 1.00 means benefits of HV and electric vehicle are still worthy of government subsidies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3abiodiesel 3aissues and policy 3aliquid petroleum gas 3alongevity 3amodels 3apollution 3apurchasing 3asubsidies 3avehicles (equipment) 3aTaiwan 0alife expectancy 0amedical expenditures 0agreenhouse gases 0aair pollutants 0aARCoB model 0alow-emission vehicles1 aChen, Ling-Ling1 aShih, Yi-Hsuan0 tJournal of integrative environmental sciences.g2015 Jan. 2, v. 12, no. 1 p.39-48dTaylor & Francisx1943-81687nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/1943815X.2014.9807473Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02922naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100001800166245008500184300001600269520156800285592002801853650002701881650000901908650001001917650001201927650001401939650002501953650004001978650001002018650001702028650002002045650001702065651001902082653001602101653001102117653002802128700001802156700002102174700001902195700002002214773014002234856008102374852000902455655001202464IND60651157320221119171344.0190711e201708  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065115732DNAL7 a278048962pmid7 a10.1017/S00296651160028222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMorgan, A. E.10aInvestigating cholesterol metabolism and ageing using a systems biology approach  ap. 378-391.  aCVD accounted for 27 % of all deaths in the UK in 2014, and was responsible for 1·7 million hospital admissions in 2013/2014. This condition becomes increasingly prevalent with age, affecting 34·1 and 29·8 % of males and females over 75 years of age respectively in 2011. The dysregulation of cholesterol metabolism with age, often observed as a rise in LDL-cholesterol, has been associated with the pathogenesis of CVD. To compound this problem, it is estimated by 2050, 22 % of the world's population will be over 60 years of age, in culmination with a growing resistance and intolerance to pre-existing cholesterol regulating drugs such as statins. Therefore, it is apparent research into additional therapies for hypercholesterolaemia and CVD prevention is a growing necessity. However, it is also imperative to recognise this complex biological system cannot be studied using a reductionist approach; rather its biological uniqueness necessitates a more integrated methodology, such as that offered by systems biology. In this review, we firstly discuss cholesterol metabolism and how it is affected by diet and the ageing process. Next, we describe therapeutic strategies for hypercholesterolaemia, and finally how the systems biology paradigm can be utilised to investigate how ageing interacts with complex systems such as cholesterol metabolism. We conclude by emphasising the need for nutritionists to work in parallel with the systems biology community, to develop novel approaches to studying cholesterol metabolism and its interaction with ageing.  aPublisher supplied data 3acholesterol metabolism 3adiet 3adrugs 3afemales 3ahospitals 3ahypercholesterolemia 3alow density lipoprotein cholesterol 3amales 3apathogenesis 3asystems biology 3atherapeutics 3aUnited Kingdom 0aCholesterol 0aAgeing 0aComputational modelling1 aMooney, K.

Some research hypotheses are statistically tested in order to identify the extent of managers' understanding regarding Green Public Procurement mainly under the severe financial conditions of the current economic crisis, during which time public expenditures should gradually be cut due to the flagship policy of the European Union for severe austerity measures. The data were taken from various pieces of research carried out in Greece and Cyprus, two countries which are suffering from an economic crisis and are operating under economic supervision with severe austerity measures. The study highlights that given the current economic climate, managers consider the Green Public Procurement a very weak tool to encourage the adoption of environmental management practices due to the austerity measures and budgetary cuts. They also claimed that the classical policy tools (e.g. environmental legislation and market-based instruments) might shape an unsustainable environment for their future operations and additional measures would force them out of market.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEuropean Union 3aeconomic outlook and situation 3aenvironmental law 3aenvironmental management 3aissues and policy 3amanagers 3amarkets 3aCyprus 3aGreece 0aenvironmental policy 0acorporate environmental management 0acorporate sustainability 0asustainable development1 aLoizou, Clairia0 tJournal of integrative environmental sciences.g2015 Jan. 2, v. 12, no. 1 p.49-66dTaylor & Francisx1943-81687nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/1943815X.2014.9936573Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01442naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245003700168300001600205520047400221592002800695650001400723650001000737650001700747650001200764650001700776651001800793653001900811653001600830653002300846653001100869700001900880773009800899856008600997852000901083655001201092IND60610408920221116184214.0181030e201810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061040892DNAL7 a10.1016/j.econlet.2018.07.0332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBracha, Anat10aWage inflation and informal work  ap. 159-163.  aDespite the low unemployment rate in the United States, wage inflation has remained modest.

The active power set-points (APSPs), established to regulate the wind farm power output (WFPO), are one of the analysed parameters. The WF considered as case study is integrated in the Gorona del Viento wind-hydro power plant (El Hierro-Canary Islands-Spain), which supplies the primary energy demand of the island.Statistical inference between the errors generated by different WFPO estimation models, each fed with different input features, is performed. These models are based on supervised machine learning (ML) regression algorithms, namely support vector regression, random forest, and a combination of the strengths of these two base learning algorithms constructed using stacked regression ensemble techniques. From the results obtained, the following conclusions are drawn: a) There is a marked difference between the errors obtained with the model that only considers wind speed and direction and that which additionally incorporates the APSP parameter, showing the importance of considering this particular parameter; b) the model which incorporates air density and turbulence intensity in addition to the APSP improves the values of all the metrics, independently of the ML technique employed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3aalgorithms 3aartificial intelligence 3acase studies 3amodels 3apower plants 3aprimary energy 3aregression analysis 3aturbulent flow 3awind farms 3awind power 3awind speed 0aWind farm power output 0aMachine learning 0aActive power set-point 0aNacelle orientation 0aAir density 0aTurbulence intensity1 aCarta, José A.1 aCastañeda, Alberto,0 tRenewable energy.g2020 Oct., v. 159 p.812-826dElsevier LtdwJournal:11970x0960-14817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.renene.2020.05.1873Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01988naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245009000163300001600253520069300269592002800962650001900990650001201009650001001021650001601031650003301047650001601080650003001096650001801126650001101144650001001155650001201165650001001177651001001187651001701197700001701214700002001231700001701251700001501268700001301283700002001296700001701316700002101333773009501354856004801449852000901497655001201506IND50069884720221120021850.0131018e201311  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006988472DNAL7 a10.1007/s11557-012-0885-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Wenhuan12aA new species of Devriesia causing sooty blotch and flyspeck on Rubber Trees in China  ap. 733-738.  aSooty blotch and flyspeck is a fungal disease complex that colonizes a wide range of plants.

A pure culture was obtained, and the nuclear ITS region of rDNA was amplified by PCR. Molecular phylogeny inferred from ITS sequence data suggested that it was close to Devriesia strelitziae, reported from South Africa. Morphologically, it was characterized by longer conidia, more conidial septa, and having chlamydospores.

The juveniles of these species have long legs and are covered with granular cerotegument, which is typical of Gymnodamaeidae, but A. italicus has smooth cuticle on the gastronotum and setiform setae, whereas A. mongolicus has plicate cuticle and leaf-like setae. The larvae of both species lack seta h ₃, but the former species also lacks paraproctal setae. The nymphs of both species lack gastronotal setae la , lm and the d -series and carry the exuvial scalps of previous instars, which is typical of eupheredermous Brachypylina (Circumdehiscentiae). Arthrodamaeus italicus uses the long seta c ₃ and medium sized and curved setae c ₁, lp and h ₁ to protect these scalps against loss, whereas A. mongolicus uses the plicate cuticle. However, these four setae only weakly connect the exuvial scalps to the gastronotum of A. italicus , and the nymphs usually lose these scalps during extraction in alcohol, whereas the plicate cuticle firmly connect these scalps to the gastronotum of A. mongolicus and the nymphs bear them. The nymphs of these species have a well-developed posterior excrescence, with two pairs of setae (h ₁ and p ₁), also typical for Gymnodamaeidae, and probably is of defence importance. Arthrodamaeus italicus is a European centromeridional species, whereas A. mongolicus is known only from Mongolia. The former species is more abundant in cypress litter, but was also found in pine, yew and bush litter, whereas the latter species lives in moss and bush litter. In A. italicus , the juveniles usually dominated, whereas in A. mongolicus , the juveniles were as abundant as the adults.  aPublisher supplied data 3alegs 3aecology 3ainstars 3aontogeny 3aSarcoptiformes 3anymphs 3alarvae 3amosses and liverworts 3aadults 3ajuveniles 3aMongolia 0astage structure 0aOribatid mites 0aOribatida 0aleg setation1 aSeniczak, Anna1 aKaczmarek, Sławomir0 tInternational journal of acarology.g2016 Apr. 2, v. 42, no. 3 p.174-192dTaylor & Francisx1945-38927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01647954.2016.11519313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01522naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001400151245007000165300001600235520056500251592002800816650001200844650001400856653000800870653000800878653000800886653000800894653002100902653002200923653002200945653002400967773009800991856008601089852000901175655001201184IND60610409020221116183848.0181030e201810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061040902DNAL7 a10.1016/j.econlet.2018.07.0342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Jin10aQuality screening and information disclosure in two-sided markets  ap. 183-188.  aThis paper studies how a platform can use quality screening to alleviate the asymmetric information problem between users on the two sides.

The results showed that foxes from both sites consume the introduced European rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus) as primary prey and native small mammals as secondary prey. This is the first record of feeding habits of the culpeo fox in central Chile that reports a higher consumption of European rabbit over pooled native small mammals. The reason for this result, as well as the higher trophic niche breadth and trophic niche diversity found in culpeo fox populations from the less disturbed hill, might be due to anthropogenic impacts on the study sites. However, to validate this claim, further studies on prey availability and human impact are required. The culpeo fox can have an important role in controlling pests such as the European rabbit; therefore, a more extensive study of this issue can bring important information for the conservation and management of natural areas of central Chile that show high human impact.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOryctolagus cuniculus 3aanthropogenic activities 3acarnivores 3aecosystems 3afauna 3afoxes 3ahills 3apests 3arabbits 3asmall mammals 3atropics 3aChile 3aMediterranean region 0aChile 0adiet of carnivores 0aOryctolagus cuniculus 0asclerophyllous shrubland1 aAlvarado, Romina1 aBonacic, Cristian0 tStudies on neotropical fauna and environment.g2013 Aug. 1, v. 48, no. 2 p.89-94dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl28137x1744-51407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01650521.2013.8315213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02936naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245010600166300001800272520151700290592002801807650001201835650002501847650001901872650003001891650002001921650001901941650001701960650001801977650001801995650001302013650001202026650001802038650002902056650001002085650001602095650001902111653002502130653001202155653002502167653002602192653002502218700001802243773009902261856008502360852000902445655001202454IND60698618820221118193123.0201230e202010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069861882DNAL7 a10.1016/j.renene.2020.06.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Shuai10aCFD-DEM study of biomass gasification in a fluidized bed reactor: Effects of key operating parameters  ap. 1146-1164.  aBiomass gasification in a fluidized bed reactor is a complex process involving intricately multi-scale and multi-physics processes and may be affected by many operating parameters. In this work, it is numerically investigated at particle scale using a coupled Computational Fluid Dynamics-Discrete Element Method (CFD-DEM) approach. The flow dynamics, turbulence, heat transfer via convective, conductive, and radiative paths, and heterogeneous and homogeneous reactions are considered. The effects of key operating parameters on gasification performance are studied in terms of biomass particle diameter, initial bed temperature, steam to biomass (S/B) ratio, inlet gas flow rate, and feed position. The simulation results show biomass particle diameter has an insignificant influence on the production of H₂ and CH₄ while it slightly affects the production of CO and CO₂. Higher initial bed temperature leads to a larger decrease of gas temperature at bed exit and benefits the production of H₂ and CO. Increasing S/B ratio increases H₂ and CO₂ production while decreases CH₄ and CO production. Larger inlet gas flow rate leads to a shorter gas residence time and the decrease of S/B ratio. Biomass particles fed from the side wall give rise to higher temperature, lower H₂ and CO₂, and higher CO and CH₄ than that fed from the center bottom. Changing feed positions on the side wall has a slight influence on gas temperature while it has an insignificant influence on product compositions.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiomass 3abiomass gasification 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbon dioxide production 3acarbon monoxide 3afluidized beds 3agasification 3aheat transfer 3ahydrodynamics 3ahydrogen 3amethane 3aparticle size 3arenewable energy sources 3asteam 3atemperature 3aturbulent flow 0aBiomass gasification 0aCFD-DEM 0aOperating parameters 0aFluidized bed reactor 0aNumerical simulation1 aShen, Yansong0 tRenewable energy.g2020 Oct., v. 159 p.1146-1164dElsevier LtdwJournal:11970x0960-14817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.renene.2020.06.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02104naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005000094040001800144100002300162245010800185300001600293500000900309520094100318592002801259650001101287650001201298650002601310650001401336650001401350650002301364650001301387650001501400650001401415650001001429650001101439650001901450700002101469773012201490856009701612852000901709655001201718IND60663408020221119164009.0191122e196711  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066340802DNAL7 a10.2134/agronj1967.00021962005900060027x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMishra, Upendra N.10aManganese Nutrition of Sweet Potatoes in Relation to Manganese Content, Deficiency Symptoms, and Growth  ap. 578-581.  aepub  aSweet potatoes, variety ‘Allgold’, were grown in nutrient culture under greenhouse conditions at 8 levels of Mn ranging from 0.002 to 0.25 ppm.

However, epicormic shoots can play a fundamental role in tree survival and need to be taken into account when they occur. The presence and abundance of three morphologically different types of epicormic shoots can be used to distinguish between trees which are healthy, stressed, resilient (i.e. likely to recover after being stressed), undergoing natural crown retrenchment, or in a state of irreversible decline. Orthotropic and plagiotropic epicormic shoots, which respectively replicate the architecture of young trees and branches, act as the tree's “life insurance” against future catastrophe. On the other hand, ageotropic epicormic shoots, which have the characteristics of old age, indicate irreversible decline. Analysis of annual growth-ring width has shown that the architectural characters assessed for pedunculate oak (Quercus robur L.) are good indicators of the physiological state of the trees.  aPublisher supplied data 3aQuercus robur 3abranches 3adecline 3adiagnostic techniques 3aphysiological state 3ashoots 3atrees 0achronic oak dieback 0atree resilience 0atree architecture 0aepicormic growth1 aBouvier, Marine1 aLemaire, Jean0 tArboricultural journal.g2015 July 3, v. 37, no. 3 p.166-179dTaylor & Francisx2168-10747nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03071375.2015.10753363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02354naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001800144245017100162300001600333520099300349592002801342650002001370650002401390650001601414650001001430650002101440650001201461650000901473650001201482650001201494650001701506650001201523650002301535650001601558653001501574653001401589653001701603653001801620653002001638700003101658700001901689773010101708856007801809852000901887655001201896IND60549254020221118110759.0160909e20160802xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054925402DNAL7 a10.1515/aoas-2016-00112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYanar, Mahmut10aEffects of Hot and Sweet Red Peppers (Capsicum annuum) as Feed Supplements on Pigmentation, Sensory Properties and Weight Gain of Rainbow Trout (Onchorhynchus mykiss)  ap. 825-834.  aThis study was conducted to evaluate the effects of diets, including 0.5, 2 and 4.4% dried hot or sweet red pepper and a control diet without added red pepper, on pigmentation, sensory properties and weight gain of rainbow trout, with average initial weight of 60 g, for a rearing period of 80 days.

To fill this gap, we investigated the phylogeography and evolutionary history of three habitat‐segregated Cerastium taxa endemic to the Dinaric Alps and explored whether they responded differently to the Quaternary climatic oscillations in the Balkan Peninsula. LOCATION: Europe, Balkan Peninsula, Dinaric Alps. TAXON: Cerastium (Caryophyllaceae, angiosperms). METHODS: We combined climatic niche comparisons and species distribution modelling (SDM) on the one hand, with cytological (relative genome size, RGS) and genetic / genomic approaches such as amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) fingerprinting, phylogenetic analyses of nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer (ITS) and plastid (trnT–ndhJ) sequences on the other hand, in order to investigate how the Pleistocene glaciations and the Holocene warming influenced the phylogeographic structure of the studied taxa. SDM was used to reconstruct past, present and future habitat suitability. RESULTS: Despite nonequivalent climatic niches, we detected climatic niche similarity amongst the three Cerastium taxa. Nonhierarchical K‐means clustering of AFLP data revealed an optimal split into two geographically segregated groups in all three taxa. Genetic divergence between the northwestern and the southeastern populations can be explained by isolation in northern and southern refugia, as suggested by SDM. The ITS and plastid sequences revealed similar, although more complex, patterns of genetic differentiation, and RGS differentiation was mainly geography‐correlated. MAIN CONCLUSIONS: Despite the pronounced habitat segregation amongst the studied taxa, their overall phylogeographic structure is similar, suggesting comparable underlying processes and similar responses to the same historical events. However, we anticipate that the three taxa will respond differently to ongoing climate warming.  aPublisher supplied data  cSEE‐ERA.NET PLUS  cSerbian Ministry of Education, Science and Technological Development  cCroatian Ministry of Science and Education  cÖsterreichische Akademie der Wissenschaften  cÖsterreichischer Austauschdienst 3aCerastium 3aHolocene epoch 3aPleistocene epoch 3aamplified fragment length polymorphism 3aclimate 3agenetic variation 3agenome 3agenomics 3ageographical distribution 3ainternal transcribed spacers 3aphylogeny 3aphylogeography 3arefuge habitats 3aAlps region 3aEurope1 aTemunović, Martina1 aNiketić, Marjan,1 aTomović, Gordana,1 aSchönswetter, Peter1 aFrajman, Božo1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3667-11350 tJournal of biogeography.g2021 Aug., v. 48, no. 8 p.2022-2036dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl9765x0305-02707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jbi.141333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02262naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245006500163300001600228520124300244592002801487650002201515650001301537650002601550650001301576650001001589650001101599650000901610650001701619651001201636651001801648653001801666653002001684653001201704773008201716856008101798852000901879655001201888IND60638284220221122110408.0190428s2008    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063828422DNAL7 a10.1163/22941932-900001972doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBubner, Ben14aThe Wood Cross Sections of Hermann Nördlinger (1818–1897)  ap. 439-457.  aHermann Nördlinger (1818–1897), forestry professor in Hohenheim, Germany, published a series of wood cross sections in the years 1852 to 1888 that are introduced here to the modern wood anatomist. The sections, which vary from 50 to 100 μm in thickness, are mounted on sheets of paper and their quality is high enough to observe microscopic details. Their technical perfection is as remarkable as the mode of distribution: sections of 100 wood species were presented in a box together with a booklet containing wood anatomical descriptions. These boxes were distributed as books by the publisher Cotta, from Stuttgart, Germany, with a maximum circulation of 500 per volume. Eleven volumes comprise 1100 wood species from all over the world. These include not only conifers and broadleaved trees but also shrubs, ferns and palms representing a wide variety of woody structures. Excerpts of this collection were also published in Russian, English and French. Today, volumes of Nördlingerʼs cross sections are found in libraries throughout Europe and the United States. Thus, they are relatively easily accessible to wood anatomists who are interested in historic wood sections. A checklist with the content of each volume is appended.  aPublisher supplied data 3abroadleaved trees 3aconifers 3aferns and fern allies 3aforestry 3apaper 3ashrubs 3awood 3awood anatomy 3aGermany 3aUnited States 0aCross section 0awood collection 0ahistory0 tIAWA journal.g, v. 29, no. 4 p.439-457dBrillwJournal:6290x0928-15417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1163/22941932-900001973Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03180naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001900153245013300172520159700305592002801902650002101930650002301951650002101974650002001995650001602015650001702031650001402048650002202062650001902084650001702103650002002120650002602140650001602166650001902182650002402201650001402225650003702239650002202276650001002298650001102308653002802319653000902347653001702356653002102373700002202394700001802416700002102434773009802455856008802553852000902641655001202650IND60669792520221118044536.0191214e202001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066979252DNAL7 a10.1016/j.phytochem.2019.1121262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTohidi, Behnaz10aSequencing and variation of terpene synthase gene (TPS2) as the major gene in biosynthesis of thymol in different Thymus species  aThyme (Thymus spp.) is a valuable genus of Lamiaceae family with different pharmaceutical and food properties. Thymol has also been considered as the major essential oil compound in most of the studied Thymus species. In this research, the gene encoding γ-terpinene synthase (Ttps2) was sequenced in T. vulgaris and in eight Iranian thymes including T. carmanicus, T. daenensis, T. fedtschenkoi, T. kotschyanus, T. migricus, T. pubescens, T. serpyllum, and T. trautvetteri. Genetic relationships based on terpene synthase genes were also determined among the studied species. Rapid Amplification of cDNA Ends (RACE) PCR was done to complete the sequence of all species. The cDNA of the studied species possessed an open reading frame ranging from 1788 to 1794 bp that encode for a protein of 596–598 amino acids, presenting all the conserved motifs characteristics of monoterpene synthases. The taxonomic status of Thymus species was determined based on eight reported sections. The species were classified in three major groups. The first and second group comprised species of Micantes and Mastichina sections. The third cluster included the species belonging to Serpyllum and Pseudothymbra sections. Overall, phylogenetic analysis according to whole sequence of Ttps2 gene can help providing insights in respect to its evolutionary process. Finally, clustering based on the amount of main essential oils components (thymol and carvacrol) was compared with that based on Ttps2 gene classification in the studied Thymus species, showing that clustering is not always in accordance.  aPublisher supplied data 3aThymus daenensis 3aThymus kotschyanus 3aThymus serpyllum 3aThymus vulgaris 3aamino acids 3abiosynthesis 3acarvacrol 3acomplementary DNA 3aessential oils 3afood quality 3agamma-terpinene 3agenetic relationships 3amajor genes 3amonoterpenoids 3aopen reading frames 3aphylogeny 3arapid amplification of cDNA ends 3aterpene synthases 3athyme 3athymol 0aThymus spp. (Lamiaceae) 0acDNA 0aPhylogenetic 0aTerpene synthase1 aRahimmalek, Mehdi1 aArzani, Ahmad1 aTrindade, Helena0 tPhytochemistry.g2020 Jan., v. 169 p.112126-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl44710x0031-94227nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.phytochem.2019.1121263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02435naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001500150245020800165300001600373520109200389592002801481650001601509650001101525650000901536650002601545650002901571650001501600650002601615650002901641650001001670700001801680700002101698700001501719700001901734700001701753700002001770700001501790700002001805773009501825856008401920852000902004655001202013IND60112976120221120081435.0141111e20120706xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011297612DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chroma.2012.05.0282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJiang, Hao12aA sensitive and accurate liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry method for quantitative determination of the novel hepatitis C NS5A inhibitor BMS-790052 (daclastasvir) in human plasma and urine  ap. 117-121.  aA liquid–liquid extraction (LLE) and liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry (LC–MS/MS) methods have been developed and validated for the quantification of BMS-790052 (daclastasvir) in human plasma and urine. The samples were extracted with methyl-t-butyl ether (MTBE) before analyzing by an API 4000 mass spectrometer which was operated in a multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode for detection of positively charged ions of BMS-790052 and its internal standard, ¹³C₁₀-BMS-790052. The standard curves ranged from 0.050 to 50.0ng/mL for BMS-790052 in human plasma, and 1.00–1000ng/mL in human urine. The intra-assay precision (%CV), based on four levels of analytical QCs (low, geometric mean, mid and high), was within 8.6%; inter-assay precision (%CV) was within 6.7% for both plasma and urine methods, and the mean assay accuracy (%Dev) was within ±3.0% for both plasma and urine methods. The ruggedness of this accurate, precise, and selective LLE–LC–MS/MS method has been demonstrated in the successful analysis of several thousand clinical study samples.  aPublisher supplied data 3ahepatitis C 3ahumans 3aions 3aliquid chromatography 3aliquid-liquid extraction 3amonitoring 3aquantitative analysis 3atandem mass spectrometry 3aurine1 aZeng, Jianing1 aKandoussi, Hamza1 aLiu, Yifei1 aWang, Xiaodong1 aBifano, Marc1 aCojocaru, Laura1 aRyan, John1 aArnold, Mark E.0 tJournal of chromatography.g2012 July 6, v. 1245 p.117-121dElsevier B.V.x0021-96737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chroma.2012.05.0283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02638naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100003000150245015000180300001600330520124800346592002801594650002601622650001701648650001001665650001101675650001001686650001201696650001301708650001501721650001901736650001101755650000901766650002301775650001501798650002201813650001201835651001301847653002101860653002201881653002501903653001901928773014001947856008402087852000902171655001202180IND60122446920221119215918.0150325e20130801xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012244692DNAL7 a10.1080/01650521.2013.8416272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBorges, Sérgio Henrique,10aBird species distribution in a complex Amazonian landscape: species diversity, compositional variability and biotic–environmental relationships  ap. 106-118.  aThe purpose of this study is to analyze the avifauna of a complex Amazonian landscape to understand the contribution of habitat heterogeneity to the regional bird diversity. Birds were sampled with mist nets and point counts in six vegetation types in the Jaú National Park, Brazilian Amazon. White sand campinas and white sand forests were less diverse than other vegetation types. Despite their lower diversity, the bird faunas of white sand campinas and open canopy flooded forests were very distinct at the landscape scale. Dominance of individuals in white sand campinas, open canopy flooded forests and a white sand forest was higher than in other vegetation types. Number of species was correlated with area and structural complexity of the vegetation. Species composition was distinct between vegetation types and ordinations of sites revealed ecological gradients related to the soil variability and flooding regimes. Habitat heterogeneity provided by the river’s seasonal flooding and the distribution of soil types is important for structuring bird communities in the study region. Additionally, allopatric speciation and dispersal events play important roles in the diversification of bird communities in the Jaú National Park.  aPublisher supplied data 3aallopatric speciation 3abiogeography 3abirds 3acanopy 3afauna 3aforests 3ahabitats 3alandscapes 3anational parks 3arivers 3asand 3asoil heterogeneity 3asoil types 3aspecies diversity 3atropics 3aAmazonia 0aBrazilian Amazon 0abird distribution 0aecological gradients 0asoil diversity0 tStudies on neotropical fauna and environment.g2013 Aug. 1, v. 48, no. 2 p.106-118dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl28137x1744-51407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01650521.2013.8416273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03448naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001800153245006000171300001800231520196200249592002802211650001602239650001402255650001302269650001902282650002102301650001802322650001602340650001502356650001902371650002902390650004402419650001002463651001102473653001302484653001802497653001502515700002002530700001902550700001502569700002102584700002002605700002002625700002002645700005902665773012102724856008802845852000902933655001202942IND60582286220221118153533.0181010e20180215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058228622DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2017.08.3182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLin, Liang-Yu10aChildhood exposure to phthalates and pulmonary function  ap. 1282-1289.  aPhthalate exposure is related to the development of allergic diseases; however, studies regarding its effect on lung function are limited. Our study aims to identify an association between phthalate exposure at different ages and lung function in children at age 9 by conducting a cohort study. The Taiwan Birth Panel Study (TBPS) was established from April 2004 to January 2005. Urine samples were collected from children in the TBPS cohort at ages 2, 5, and 9years. Urinary phthalate metabolite concentrations were measured via ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry. Questionnaires, lung function tests and serum IgE levels were obtained from children at the age of 9. Multiple linear regressions adjusted for confounding factors were applied to investigate the associations between phthalate exposure at different ages and lung function at age 9. Our results demonstrate that in children with allergic diseases, a per log unit increase in the urinary phthalate metabolite mono-ethyl phthalate (MEP) concentration at age 9 was associated with a decreasing forced expiratory volume in 1 sec (FEV1) (β=−25.22; 95% CI: −47.53 to −2.91 per log ml/ln-μg/g cr) and forced vital capacity (FVC) (β=−32.3; 95% CI: -63.51 to −1.09 per log ml/ln-μg/g cr). For children with high serum IgE levels (>100kU/L) at age 9, the urinary MEP concentrations at the same age were negatively associated with the FEV1 (β=−30.4; 95% CI: −56.8 to −4.0 per log ml/ln-μg/g cr), FVC (β=−47.6; 95% CI: −84.2 to −11.0 per log ml/ln-μg/g cr) and peak expiratory flow (PEF) (β=−102.4; 95% CI: 180.2 to −24.7 per log ml/ln-μg/g cr). Phthalate exposure at ages 2 and 5 had little effect on lung function at age 9. Our study suggests that concurrent exposure to phthalates, such as MEP, is negatively associated with lung function in children. Further investigation is required to elaborate on this correlation.  aPublisher supplied data 3ablood serum 3achildhood 3achildren 3acohort studies 3aimmunoglobulin E 3alung function 3ametabolites 3aphthalates 3aquestionnaires 3atandem mass spectrometry 3aultra-performance liquid chromatography 3aurine 3aTaiwan 0aChildren 0aLung function 0aPhthalates1 aTsai, Meng-Shan1 aChen, Mei-Huei1 aNg, Sharon1 aHsieh, Chia-Jung1 aLin, Ching-Chun1 aLu, Frank Leigh1 aHsieh, Wu-Shiun1 aChen, Pau-Chung1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6242-59740 tScience of the total environment.g2018 Feb. 15, v. 615 p.1282-1289dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2017.08.3183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02929naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245006800167300001400235520155100249592002801800650001201828650002201840650001401862650001101876650002401887650002901911650001201940650000901952650000901961650000701970650001501977650001501992650001402007650001102021650002802032653002702060653007902087653004902166700002202215700002302237700001902260773009002279856008102369852000902450655001202459IND60544778220221120213946.0160901e20150602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054477822DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aca.2015.03.0452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLisak, Grzegorz10aTextile-based sampling for potentiometric determination of ions  ap. 71-79.  aPotentiometric sensing utilizing textile-based micro-volume sampling was applied and evaluated for the determination of clinically (Na+, K+, Cl–) and environmentally (Cd2+, Pb2+ and pH) relevant analytes. In this technological design, calibration solutions and samples were absorbed into textiles while the potentiometric cells (ion-selective electrodes and reference electrode) were pressed against the textile. Once the liquid, by wicking action, reached the place where the potentiometric cell was pressed onto the textile, hence closing the electric circuit, the potentiometric response was obtained. Cotton, polyamide, polyester and their blends with elastane were applied for micro-volume sampling. The textiles were found to influence the determination of pH in environmental samples with pH close to neutral and Pb2+ at low analyte concentrations. On the other hand, textile-based micro-volume sampling was successfully applied in measurements of Na+ using solid-contact sodium-selective electrodes utilizing all the investigated textiles for sampling. It was found that in order to extend the application of textile-based sampling toward environmental analysis of ions it will be necessary to tailor the physio-chemical properties of the textile materials. In general, textile-based sampling opens new possibilities for direct chemical analysis of small-volume samples and provide a simple and low-cost method to screen various textiles for their effects on samples to identify which textiles are the most suitable for on-body sensing.  aPublisher supplied data 3acadmium 3achemical analysis 3achlorides 3acotton 3aelectronic circuits 3aenvironmental assessment 3afabrics 3aions 3alead 3apH 3apolyamides 3apolyesters 3apotassium 3asodium 3aspecific ion electrodes 0aTextile-based sampling 0aPotentiometric determination of ions in clinical and environmental samples 0aNon-invasive wearable potentiometric sensors1 aArnebrant, Thomas1 aRuzgas, Tautgirdas1 aBobacka, Johan0 tAnalytica chimica acta.g2015 June 02, v. 877 p.71-79dElsevier B.V.x0003-26707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aca.2015.03.0453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02615naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245009800163300001300261520143500274592002801709650001301737650001301750650001201763650001301775650002501788650001101813650001501824650001001839650001701849650001001866651001001876653001801886653002701904653001301931653001401944653001801958700001801976700001801994773007902012856008102091852000902172655001202181IND60638284320221122110345.0190428s2009    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063828432DNAL7 a10.1163/22941932-900001982doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFan, Ze-Xin10aAxial and Radial Variations in Xylem Anatomy of Angiosperm and Conifer Trees in Yunnan, China  ap. 1-13.  aThe model of West, Brown and Enquist (WBE model) showed that lumen hydraulic resistance in trees can be independent of path length, provided that vascular conduits widen basipetally and sufficiently, and the number of functional conduits is constant from twigs to trunk. To test the anatomical realism of this model, we investigated axial and radial changes in xylem characteristics of six angiosperm tree species (fourteen trees, 15–25 m tall) and three coniferous tree species (seven trees, 16–45 m) in Yunnan, China. Conduit lumen diameter increased linearly with distance from the top of the bole to its base in six trees. In all but one of the fifteen remaining trees, lumen diameter increased from the top to near the base of the crown but remained constant or increased more slowly below the crown. Similar, but inverse patterns were found for axial variation in vessel density of the angiosperms, which indicated that the number of conducting vessels increases from trunk to twig as they become narrower. Vessel diameters increased almost linearly with cambial age for the first 20 to 40 years, and then stabilized or increased more slowly in eight trees of Fagaceae. Axial trends in conduit lumen diameter and number were consistent with only partial buffering of hydraulic resistance from pathlength effects, generally confined to the crown region. Neither conduit taper nor number was consistent with the WBE model.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFagaceae 3abranches 3acambium 3aconifers 3ahydraulic resistance 3amodels 3atree trunk 3atrees 3awood anatomy 3axylem 3aChina 0aChinese trees 0ahydraulic architecture 0atapering 0aWBE model 0axylem anatomy1 aCao, Kun-Fang1 aBecker, Peter0 tIAWA journal.g, v. 30, no. 1 p.1-13dBrillwJournal:6290x0928-15417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1163/22941932-900001983Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02893naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245010100168506010400269506007600373520140300449592002801852506003701880650002301917650001401940650002201954650002001976650001601996650001902012650002002031653001502051653000902066653001702075653002802092653002202120653001302142653001602155653001302171653001602184700005802200773009402258856008602352852000902438655001202447IND60709551320221207124153.0220523e202009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070955132DNAL7 a10.1016/j.heliyon.2020.e047462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLins, Samuel10aDevelopment and initial psychometric properties of a panic buying scale during COVID-19 pandemic  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aFear is a powerful driver of human behavior, even more during times of crisis. Panic buying occurs when fear and panic influence behavior leading people to buy more things than usual. So far, no specific scale on this has been found in the major databases, thus the aim of this exploratory study is to develop a Panic Buying Scale (PBS) during COVID-19 pandemic. 393 Brazilians took part in this study (251 women and 142 men), answering a sociodemographic questionnaire and instruments of these variables: (1)panic buying, (2)impulse buying, (3)temporal focus, (4)optimism, (5)risk perception, (6)need for cognition. Data collection was conducted through an online questionnaire which was shared through social media networks, from April 10th to May 4th, 2020. Factorial exploratory and confirmatory analysis indicated that PBS has a unidimensional solution and showed satisfactory reliability indexes. Results revealed that men buy more by panic than women. PBS also was positively correlated with impulse buying, past and future temporal focus, and risk perception; as well as negatively correlated with optimism and age. Findings suggest that PBS is psychometrically acceptable in the Brazilian context. This new instrument can be useful to understand the psychosocial phenomena associated with consumer behavior. Future investigations could provide more evidences of validity in other contexts.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aCOVID-19 infection 3acognition 3aconsumer behavior 3adata collection 3afearfulness 3aquestionnaires 3arisk perception 0aPsychology 0aFear 0aPanic buying 0aPsychometric properties 0aConsumer behavior 0aCOVID-19 0aConsumption 0aValidity 0aReliability1 aAquino, Sibele1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1391-09110 tHeliyon.g2020 Sept., v. 6, no. 9 p.e04746-dElsevier LtdwJournal:23264x2405-84407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2020.e047463Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02498naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245012100169300001200290520136400302592002801666650001301694650001101707650001001718650001601728650001901744650002401763650001401787650001101801650001801812650000901830650001801839650001101857651001001868700002301878700002101901773008401922856008502006852000902091655001202100IND60515425720221118060533.0160315e20160102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051542572DNAL7 a10.1080/00063657.2015.10777782doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRyan, Lucy J.10aWeather conditions and conspecific density influence survival of overwintering Dunlin Calidris alpina in North Wales  ap. 1-9.  aCapsule Inter-annual survival rates of juvenile Dunlin Calidris alpina increased with wet weather conditions but decreased with the density of conspecifics in winter, ranging from 0.34 to 0.62 in the best model. Adult inter-annual survival remained high and constant at 0.72. Aims To estimate inter-annual survival rates of both adult and juvenile Dunlin in North Wales. To quantify the effects on survival rates of weather conditions and conspecific density. Methods Cormack–Jolly–Seber models in Program MARK were used to analyse 21 years of ringing data (1990–2011) from Traeth Lafan, North Wales. Models were constructed using a two age-class structure. The influence of a range of weather conditions and WeBS census data on survival were examined. Results Adult survival was best modelled at a constant rate of 0.72 (se 0.008) across the 21 years. Juvenile survival rates were found to vary most strongly with total rainfall (mm) during the season and the number of conspecifics present. Survival rates varied from 0.34 (se 0.06) to 0.62 (se 0.09), with higher survival in years with high rainfall and low numbers of birds. Conclusion Survival rates of juvenile Dunlin are affected by both weather and density of conspecifics. These results have implications for the future of Dunlin in the UK when considering both climate change and habitat loss.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCalidris 3aadults 3abirds 3acensus data 3aclimate change 3ahabitat destruction 3ajuveniles 3amodels 3aoverwintering 3arain 3asurvival rate 3awinter 3aWales1 aGreen, Jonathan A.1 aDodd, Stephen G.0 tBird study.g2016 Jan. 2, v. 63, no. 1 p.1-9dTaylor & Francisx1944-67057nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00063657.2015.10777783Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01813naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245015000167300001600317520073700333592002801070650002701098650002701125650001601152650001901168650004601187650001501233650002601248650000701274700001801281773009501299856008401394852000901478655001201487IND60112976320221120102137.0141111e20120706xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011297632DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chroma.2012.05.0392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRebane, Riin10aComparison of three buffer solutions for amino acid derivatization and following analysis by liquid chromatography electrospray mass spectrometry  ap. 134-142.  aFor reversed phase separation amino acids are usually derivatized. Several derivatization reactions are carried out at basic pH. In the present work, influence of three basic buffer solutions on liquid chromatography electrospray ionization mass-spectrometric (LC–ESI-MS) analysis of amino acid derivatives was studied. Borate buffer – the most common derivatization buffer – was found to influence ESI ionization up to 23min retention time. For 9-fluorenylmethylmethoxycarbonyl chloride (Fmoc-Cl derivatization) carbonate buffer should be preferred as it provides higher responses. Hexafluoroisopropanol (HFIP) buffer improves chromatographic peak shapes and responses for diethyl ethoxymethylenemalonate (DEEMM) derivatives.  aPublisher supplied data 3aamino acid composition 3aamino acid derivatives 3aamino acids 3aderivatization 3aelectrospray ionization mass spectrometry 3aionization 3aliquid chromatography 3apH1 aHerodes, Koit0 tJournal of chromatography.g2012 July 6, v. 1245 p.134-142dElsevier B.V.x0021-96737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chroma.2012.05.0393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02256naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100003200147245006900179300001600248520136700264592002801631650001201659650002401671650001201695650001601707700002201723700002401745773014001769856004801909852000901957655001201966IND50089727120221120094626.0140517e201406  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008972712DNAL7 a10.1007/s13253-014-0171-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuillera-Arroita, Gurutzeta10aTwo-Stage Bayesian Study Design for Species Occupancy Estimation  ap. 278-291.  aA problem of interest for ecology and conservation is that of determining the best allocation of survey effort in studies aimed at estimating the proportion of sites occupied by a species. Many species are difficult to detect and often remain undetected during surveys at sites where they are present. Hence, for the estimator of species occupancy to be unbiased, detectability needs to be taken into account. In such studies there is a trade-off between sampling more sites and expending more survey effort within each site. This design problem has not been addressed to date with an explicit consideration of the uncertainty in assumed parameter values. In this article we apply sequential and Bayesian design techniques and show how a simple two-stage design can significantly improve the efficiency of the study. We further investigate the optimal allocation of survey effort between the two study stages, given a prior distribution for the parameter values. We address this problem using asymptotic approximations and then explore how the results change when the sample size is small, considering second-order approximations and highlighting the value of simulations as a tool for study design. Given the efficiency gain, we recommend following the sequential design approach for species occupancy estimation.

Extract-carrier mixtures contained three levels (250, 500 and 750 g/kg) of the microencapsulating agents, namely corn syrup solids, commonly used by the food industry, and inulin, a low-kilojoule alternative. The amorphous spray-dried powders ranged from nearly free-flowing to cohesive. Their moisture content and water activity fell within the range of their monolayer moisture values. The moisture sorption isotherm of the pure extract showed very little hysteresis, contrary to the mixtures containing carriers. Similar values for calculated and experimental heat flow, determined by isothermal microcalorimetry, indicated the carriers to be compatible with the extract, except when used in a mixture containing 750 g/kg corn syrup solids per total solids. Spray-drying had no detrimental effect on the individual phenolic content, in particular the heat labile mangiferin, isomangiferin and 3-β-d-glucopyranosyliriflophenone, and the total antioxidant capacity of the extract. Microencapsulation of C. subternata extract with inulin by spray-drying thus provides a stable low-kilojoule powder, suitable for formulation of single-serve beverage mixtures that can be used by diabetics.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCyclopia subternata 3aantioxidant activity 3abeverages 3acorn syrup 3afood industry 3aheat 3ahysteresis 3ainulin 3amicroencapsulation 3aphenolic compounds 3apowders 3asorption isotherms 3aspray drying 3atotal solids 3awater activity 3awater content 0aPhenolic compounds 0aPhysicochemical properties 0aStability 0aThermal analysis 0aEriocitrin (PubChem CID: 83489) 0aHesperidin (PubChem CID:10621) 0aIsomangiferin (PubChem CID: 5318597) 0aMangiferin (PubChem CID: 5281647)1 aDe Beer, Dalene,1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3680-142X1 aAucamp, Marique1 aLiebenberg, Wilna1 aStieger, Nicole1 aHuman, Chantelle1 aJoubert, Elizabeth0 tLebensmittel-Wissenschaft + Technologie.g2017 Jan., v. 75 p.631-639dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl1644x0023-64387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lwt.2016.10.0183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03252naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001500151245007700166300001600243520205500259592002802314650001502342650001402357650002602371650001702397650001002414650002902424650001202453650002102465650001502486653001802501653002102519653002602540653000902566653001002575700001502585700001602600700001902616773010002635856008602735852000902821655001202830IND60615790420221123005223.0190412e201901  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061579042DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecolind.2018.09.0292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDoohan, B.14aThe sound of management: Acoustic monitoring for agricultural industries  ap. 739-746.  aGlobal biodiversity is declining rapidly while the human population grows exponentially. This creates pressure for agricultural industries to improve productivity, but also demonstrate that on-farm management actions are minimising impacts on biodiversity. However, the costs and logistical considerations of traditional biodiversity assessment methods are beyond the scope of many agricultural industries and landholders. Our goal was to evaluate the potential for acoustic biodiversity monitoring in agricultural systems. We assessed a range of species-specific and more general acoustic indices using five key criteria (i.e. relevance to industry, diagnostic capability, spatio-temporal scale, logistical feasibility, and utility as a biodiversity surrogate) to determine whether they were suitable for assessing biodiversity outcomes for agricultural industries and individual farmers. Based on these assessment criteria, species-specific or guild-specific acoustic bioindicators that are processed using automatic recognisers are more appropriate for biodiversity monitoring when the goal is to assess industry- or farm-specific impacts on biodiversity. If there is no need to establish a diagnostic link between on-farm management practices and biodiversity, then acoustic indices are more logistically feasible to use and may more accurately reflect overall biodiversity. We also recommend using birds and bats for acoustic monitoring in agricultural systems because they are relatively easy to monitor, exhibit peaks in activity around dusk or dawn, and are not necessarily water dependent. We believe that acoustic monitoring has the potential to deliver consistent, repeatable results at a relatively low cost compared to traditional biodiversity monitoring, which will allow individual farmers and agricultural industries to more easily track their sustainability performance. This becomes even more critical as we consider the increasing role that agricultural regions will have in sustaining the world’s rapidly declining biodiversity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChiroptera 3aacoustics 3aagricultural industry 3abiodiversity 3abirds 3aenvironmental indicators 3afarmers 3ahuman population 3amonitoring 0aBioindicators 0aAcoustic indices 0aAutomatic recognisers 0aBats 0aBirds1 aFuller, S.1 aParsons, S.1 aPeterson, E.E.0 tEcological indicators.g2019 Jan., v. 96 p.739-746dElsevier LtdwJournal:6196x1470-160X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2018.09.0293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03095naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001400146245013100160300002000291520186000311592002802171650002402199650001502223650001802238650001602256650002102272650001002293650000902303650001002312650001902322700001802341700005702359700005502416773017302471856008002644852000902724655001202733IND60746460120221120094101.0210805e20210723xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074646012DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.iecr.1c021662doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Kai10aHighly Flexible, Multicolored, and Multifunctional Single-Fiber-Based Microsensors for UV, Temperature, and Infrared Detection  ap. 11151-11160.  aFlexible and multifunctional microsensors have attracted wide attention owing to their multiple-sensing functions and diverse application fields. Here, we develop a series of highly flexible, multicolored, and multifunctional single-fiber-based (SFB) microsensors for flexible functional electronics. The SFB microsensors are based on the ingenious combination of single ZnO-coated carbon fiber (CF), flexible indium tin oxide/poly(ethylene terephthalate) (ITO/PET) membrane, and typing paper through a facile integration method. Specifically, a series of ZnO-coated CFs are prepared by chemically and coaxially depositing ZnO nanolayers on the CF surface through the atomic layer deposition (ALD) technique. Notably, the resultant SFB microsensors exhibit vivid and tunable structural colors originating from the thin-film interference of ZnO nanolayers as well as optical anisotropy because of the distinct axisymmetric structure of the CF. Benefiting from the optoelectronic properties of the ZnO nanolayer and delicate device structure, the SFB microsensors show a high UV sensitivity (120%) and good mechanical stability at varying bending angles (0–150°) and cycles (600 cycles). Moreover, by harnessing the pyroelectric and photothermal effects, the SFB microsensors can also be utilized to detect ambient temperature changes (0–55 °C) and IR light with high linearity, relatively high sensitivity (0.74% °C–¹), and good stability. Owing to these merits, such SFB microsensors are capable of monitoring mouth respiration and nose breathing, implying their applications in wearable health monitors. This work not only integrates different sensing capabilities into a flexible device with reduced complexity but also miniaturizes the size of the device dramatically, holding tremendous prospects for diverse smart microsensing applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aambient temperature 3aanisotropy 3acarbon fibers 3aelectronics 3aindium tin oxide 3amouth 3anose 3apaper 3aprocess design1 aWang, Yunpeng1 aZhang, Shufen1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3390-41991 aNiu, Wenbin1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5507-15920 tIndustrial & engineering chemistry process design and development.g2021 July 23, v. 60, no. 30 p.11151-11160dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23342x1520-50457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.iecr.1c021663Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02762naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100003000148245012600178300001800304520106000322592002801382596005401410596005401464596005401518596005401572596005401626596005601680650001101736650002501747650001301772650002301785650001001808650001101818650001201829650001701841650001701858650001601875700003601891700003401927700003901961700008002000773013202080856008302212852000902295655001202304IND60743516920221118025021.0210723e202108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074351692DNAL7 a10.1007/s13197-020-04800-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRivera-Hernández, Lorena10aPectin-gellan films intended for active food packaging: release kinetics of nisin and physico-mechanical characterization  ap. 2973-2981.  aFilms were prepared by casting 2% w/v apple pectin, 0.5% w/v low-acyl gellan and 2.2% w/v glycerol as plasticizer. Bioactive film (BF, films with 3912 International Units (IU) nisin/cm²) and control films (CF, films without nisin) were elaborated. The objective was to analyze the release kinetics of nisin from films to a food model, to determine the period of film bioactivity and potential use as antimicrobial packaging. The release of nisin from BF to a food model was determined at 5 °C and 30 °C. The release kinetics of nisin was fitted to the analytical solution of the Fick’s second law for an infinite plate. The diffusion coefficients of nisin (D) were 5.22 × 10–¹⁴ and 7.36 × 10–¹⁴ m²/s for 5 °C and 30 °C, respectively. Besides, both films were characterized in their mechanical properties and gas permeabilities [oxygen (PO₂) and water vapour permeability (WVP)]. The mechanical properties were reduced by the nisin incorporation, whereas PO₂ was increased, and no significant effect on WVP was observed.  aPublisher supplied data  a416247cConsejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología  a230138cConsejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología  a239553cConsejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología  a269805cConsejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología  a254437cConsejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología  aPRODEP-SEP-2016cSecretaría de Educación Pública 3aapples 3abioactive properties 3aglycerol 3amodel food systems 3anisin 3aoxygen 3apectins 3apermeability 3aplasticizers 3awater vapor1 aChavarría-Hernández, Norberto1 aLópez Cuellar, Ma del Rocío1 aMartínez Juárez, Víctor Manuel,1 aRodríguez-Hernández, Adriana-Inés1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6664-92650 tJournal of food science and technology.g2021 Aug., v. 58, no. 8 p.2973-2981dSpringer IndiawJournal:jnl16929x0022-11557nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13197-020-04800-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02878naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002100146245014700167300002000314520166100334592002801995650001402023650002302037650001102060650001402071650001502085650001902100650001602119650001702135700001802152700001602170700001302186700005502199773017302254856008002427852000902507655001202516IND60746460220221120094030.0210805e20210723xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074646022DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.iecr.1c022542doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJiang, Shun-Feng10aPreparation of Flower-like CuFe₂O₄ by a Self-Templating Method for High-Efficient Activation of Peroxymonosulfate To Degrade Carbamazepine  ap. 11045-11055.  aDesign of the low-cost and environmentally friendly catalyst for advanced oxidation processes is highly desired in environmental remediation. Herein, a flower-like CuFe₂O₄ nanostructure is synthesized by a self-templating method for the first time and used for the activation of peroxymonosulfate (PMS) to degrade carbamazepine (CBZ). The catalytic performance of the flower-like CuFe₂O₄ is much higher than that of the other CuFe₂O₄ structures (nanoparticles, bulk, and sphere). 90% of CBZ (10 mg/L) can be degraded by adding 0.1 g/L of CuFe₂O₄–₁₆–₃₅₀ and 0.2 g/L PMS, and 50% of TOC got removed in 120 min. After five consecutive cycles, the CBZ removal efficiency by the flower-like CuFe₂O₄ still remains at 66%. Kinetic behavior of CBZ degradation follows the pseudo-first-order reaction model, and the reaction rate constant value of the flower-like CuFe₂O₄ is 3.7 times higher than that of CuFe₂O₄ nanoparticles. The structure-dependent catalytic activity of CuFe₂O₄ catalysts is investigated by experiments and characterizations such as BET, XPS, and H₂-TPR. The results show that the excellent catalytic performance of the flower-like CuFe₂O₄ is mainly attributed to the strong interaction of dual metal species in it apart from its high specific surface area and large pore volume. A reasonable mechanism of PMS activation is established on the basis of the characterizations of catalyst, radical determination, and the identification of intermediates. This work provides a novel strategy to develop a highly efficient and stable spinel catalyst for pollutant degradation through PMS activation.  aPublisher supplied data 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3amodels 3aoxidation 3apollutants 3aprocess design 3aremediation 3asurface area1 aWang, Lu−Lu1 aHu, Wei-Fei1 aTian, Ke1 aJiang, Hong1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4261-79870 tIndustrial & engineering chemistry process design and development.g2021 July 23, v. 60, no. 30 p.11045-11055dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23342x1520-50457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.iecr.1c022543Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01213naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245007600170300001200246520028700258592002800545650002400573653000700597653000700604653000700611653001500618653002700633653002400660700002000684773010100704856008500805852000900890655001200899IND60599775020221122054829.0180702e201307  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059977502DNAL7 a10.1016/j.econlet.2013.03.0362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCracau, Daniel10aBonus payments as an anti-corruption instrument: A theoretical approach  ap. 1-4.  aWe analyse bonus payments for officials, who transfer payments truthfully to the government rather than collecting bribes.

The properties of the films were evaluated by determining the thickness, tensile measurements, moisture content, water vapor permeability, apparent opacity, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) analysis and thermogravimetric analysis. Flaxseed mucilage, when mixed with PVA, produces less resistant, less rigid, more-flexible films, has a higher thermal stability, and does not change the water vapor barrier properties compared with pure mucilage films. SEM revealed that films with mucilage and PVA mixtures formed a compact and homogeneous structure, corroborating the FTIR spectra that indicated a chemical interaction between these two biopolymers. In general, the degree of PVA hydrolysis did not influence the properties of the films when mixed with flaxseed mucilage extract. Therefore, films obtained from mixtures of flaxseed mucilage and PVA can be an interesting and advantageous alternative for producing bio-based packaging.  aPublisher supplied data  a420055/2018-5cConselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3abiopolymers 3afood science 3ahydrolysis 3alinseed 3amucilages 3aopacity 3apermeability 3apolyvinyl alcohol 3athermal stability 3athermogravimetry 3awater content 3awater vapor1 aCorrea, Luana Gabrielle1 aPaulo, Ana Flávia Sampaio1 aBalan, Geane Cristiane1 aIda, Elza Iouko1 aShirai, Marianne Ayumi1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0795-63580 tJournal of food science and technology.g2021 Aug., v. 58, no. 8 p.3030-3038dSpringer IndiawJournal:jnl16929x0022-11557nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13197-020-04806-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02469naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001700146245009600163300002000259520119600279592002801475650002001503650001401523650001801537650001801555650001701573650001801590650002401608650002101632650001901653700005801672700005701730700005801787773017301845856008002018852000902098655001202107IND60746460320221120094112.0210805e20210714xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074646032DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.iecr.1c023202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFeng, Yirong10aPerformance Evaluation and Scale-Up Behavior of an Engineered In-Line Mixer for 3D Printing  ap. 11568-11578.  aWe present a design strategy of in-line mixers for 3D printing and an evaluation protocol that comprehensively characterizes the performance of hydrodynamics, reagent mixing, heat exchange, and reaction behavior. For demonstration, we engineer a split-and-recombination (SAR)-type mixer with stationary oblique baffles which effectively blends two streams in the laminar flow regime, particularly at low and intermediate Reynolds number. The 3D printing technique that opens up new design freedom and enables rapid model evaluation and optimization is low-cost and easy to implement in the laboratory. Simulations of hydrodynamics, heat transfer, and mass transfer including reactions form a solid foundation of mixer evaluation. Experimental results of the Villermaux–Dushman reaction and pressure measurement validate the numerical model and illustrate the difference between the designed SAR mixer and a conventional T-mixer. In addition, superior mixing performance of the SAR mixer is confirmed by the mixing intensity simulations, as compared with T-/helical mixers. The presented model yields new insights into the scalability and applicability of the 3D-printed integrated reactor.  aPublisher supplied data 3aReynolds number 3achemistry 3aheat transfer 3ahydrodynamics 3alaminar flow 3amass transfer 3amathematical models 3amodel validation 3aprocess design1 aZhang, Haomiao1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7933-31551 aWang, Jingdai1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8594-42861 aYang, Yongrong1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5598-69250 tIndustrial & engineering chemistry process design and development.g2021 July 14, v. 60, no. 30 p.11568-11578dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23342x1520-50457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.iecr.1c023203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02783naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245009400172300001600266520136000282536013901642592002801781596008901809650002401898650001201922650002401934650001601958650001201974651001301986653001401999653001902013653002402032653001902056653001602075653002102091653003802112653001302150773011602163856008502279852000902364655001202373IND60612452320221120025905.0180905e20181003xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061245232DNAL7 a10.1080/17565529.2017.13722632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLohano, Heman D.10aWeather variability, agricultural revenues and internal migration: evidence from Pakistan  ap. 625-643.  aMigration is a widely used adaptation response to climate and weather variability. In this paper, we investigate how changes and variability in weather may affect internal migration through the agriculture channel. Using panel data for 50 districts of Pakistan, we estimate an instrumental variables regression model that allows us to analyse the impact of weather-driven changes in the crop revenue per hectare on the inter-district migration. Results show that temperature has a nonlinear effect, i.e. as temperature increases, the crop revenue per hectare initially increases and then declines. Furthermore, temperature variability has a negative effect on the expected crop revenue per hectare. A 1% weather-driven decrease in the crop revenue per hectare induces, on average, around 2% (0.02% point) decrease in the in-migration rate into a district. Predicted increases in temperature and its variability during 2016–2035 (relative to 1971–1998) are likely to decrease crop revenues in relatively warm districts and increase them in cooler districts. These effects would decrease the in-migration rate in 18–32 districts and increase the rate in the remaining districts. Thus, the extent and scope of the impacts of weather on migration in Pakistan depend on a district’s geographic location and the variability of temperature in the future.  aThis research was supported by the South Asian Network for Development and Environmental Economics [grant number SANDEE/July2011/002].  aPublisher supplied data  aSANDEE/July2011/002cSouth Asian Network for Development and Environmental Economics 3aagricultural income 3aclimate 3aregression analysis 3atemperature 3aweather 3aPakistan 0amigration 0aweather change 0aweather variability 0aclimate change 0aagriculture 0apanel data model 0ainstrumental variables regression 0aPakistan0 tClimate and development.g2018 Oct. 3, v. 10, no. 7 p.625-643dTaylor & FranciswJournal:19683x1756-55377nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/17565529.2017.13722633Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02202naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100003300142245012600175300001600301520087100317592002801188650002701216650002601243650001601269650000901285650001901294650001201313650001201325650002601337650001001363650001101373650002201384651001101406700002101417700001901438700002401457700002401481700002001505700001901525773013901544856007601683852000901759655001201768IND60624092920221120210444.0181201e201812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062409292DNAL7 a10.3958/059.043.04032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHernández-Juárez, Agustín10aEffect of Transgenic Maize on Abundance of the Corn Flea Beetle, Chaetocnema pulicaria Melsheimer¹, as a Non-Target Pest  ap. 841-846.  aEffect of transgenic maize Agrisure® Vipteraᵀᴹ 3111 event with Cry1Ab and Vip3Aa20 toxins of Bacillus thuringiensis Berliner that provide resistance to Lepidoptera and mCry3A to Coleoptera was tested on abundance of the corn flea beetle, Chaetocnema pulicaria Melsheimer, at Sinaloa, Mexico and compared to isoline maize with and without insecticide applied.

Vietnam in this context has been under energy security threats for more than a decade and is currently having a new power policy to strongly develop power generation and distribution networks. It is expected that the country's economy is able to develop substantially due to massively additional energy supply once completing the plants and distribution networks but the likely impacts are still undefined. This paper extends an economic electricity-detailed model to examine the potential impacts of such a new power policy in Vietnam. We find that the policy will decrease the prices of both fossil-based and renewable-based electricity significantly by 40%–78% under a 2030 target scenario, benefiting all sectors in the economy to substitute for fossil fuels. Households are particularly benefited as evidenced by 5.64%–19.19% increases in per-capita utility. Overall, the Vietnamese economy is significantly advantaged with real GDP increasing by 5.44%–24.83% over different scenarios, which are much higher than the findings in other countries. More importantly, the policy moves the country to a low-carbon energy structure in the near future.  aPublisher supplied data 3adeveloping countries 3aelectricity 3aenergy 3afossil fuels 3ahouseholds 3ainfrastructure 3aissues and policy 3amodels 3apopulation growth 3apower generation 3aprices 3aVietnam 0aVietnam 0aPower development plan 0aEnergy policy 0aComputable general equilibrium (CGE) 0aGTAP-E-Power 0aLow-carbon economy1 aNguyễn, Dương Bình,1 aNguyen, Trung H.1 aWang, Can1 aSiriwardana, Mahinda0 tEnergy policy.g2020 Sept., v. 144 p.111645-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12439x0301-42157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enpol.2020.1116453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03490naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100005700147245011300204300001500317520157300332592002801905650001901933650001501952650001601967650002601983650001502009650001302024650001302037650001402050650001402064650001502078650001402093653002902107653002102136653002602157653003002183653003802213700005302251700005602304700005802360700005602418700005802474700005702532700005502589700005702644700005602701773012402757856008202881852000902963655001202972IND60730171720221120155321.0220307e202102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073017172DNAL7 a10.1016/j.gpb.2020.09.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXing, Xiaohua1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8971-857710aQuantitative Secretome Analysis Reveals Clinical Values of Carbonic Anhydrase II in Hepatocellular Carcinoma  ap. 94-107.  aEarly detection and intervention are key strategies to reduce mortality, increase long-term survival, and improve the therapeutic effects of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients. Herein, the isobaric tag for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ)-based quantitative proteomic strategy was used to study the secretomes in conditioned media from HCC cancerous tissues, surrounding noncancerous tissues, and distal noncancerous tissues to identify diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers for HCC. In total, 22 and 49 dysregulated secretory proteins were identified in the cancerous and surrounding noncancerous tissues, respectively, compared with the distal noncancerous tissues. Among these proteins, carbonic anhydrase II (CA2) was identified to be significantly upregulated in the secretome of cancerous tissues; correspondingly, the serum concentrations of CA2 were remarkably increased in HCC patients compared with that in normal populations. Interestingly, a significant increase of serum CA2 in recurrent HCC patients after radical resection was also confirmed compared with HCC patients without recurrence, and the serum level of CA2 could act as an independent prognostic factor for time to recurrence and overall survival. Regarding the mechanism, the secreted CA2 enhances the migration and invasion of HCC cells by activating the epithelial mesenchymal transition pathway. Taken together, this study identified a novel biomarker for HCC diagnosis and prognosis, and provided a valuable resource of HCC secretome for investigating serological biomarkers.  aPublisher supplied data 3abioinformatics 3abiomarkers 3ablood serum 3acarbonate dehydratase 3aepithelium 3agenomics 3ahepatoma 3amortality 3aprognosis 3aproteomics 3aresection 0aHepatocellular carcinoma 0aTissue secretome 0aCarbonic anhydrase II 0aEarly diagnosis/prognosis 0aEpithelial mesenchymal transition1 aYuan, Hui1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7858-35391 aLiu, Hongzhi1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7102-68551 aTan, Xionghong1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9113-41591 aZhao, Bixing1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0055-39891 aWang, Yingchao1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3590-92331 aOuyang, Jiahe1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9248-88051 aLin, Minjie1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0523-29221 aLiu, Xiaolong1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3096-49811 aHuang, Aimin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3141-03150 tGenomics, proteomics & bioinformatics.g2021 Feb., v. 19, no. 1 p.94-107dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12107x1672-02297nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gpb.2020.09.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02605naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001200139245012500151300001800276520146900294592002801763650004401791650001201835650002801847650001601875650000901891650001301900650002301913650001601936700001701952700001401969700001601983700001401999700001302013773012102026856007502147852000902222655001202231IND60559228320221119064848.0161201e20140821xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055922832DNAL7 a10.1021/jp504201k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZou, Ye10aNew Insight into Amyloid Fibril Formation of Hen Egg White Lysozyme Using a Two-Step Temperature-Dependent FTIR Approach  ap. 9834-9843.  aHen egg white lysozyme (HEWL) is widely used in the mechanistic study of amyloid fibril formation. Yet, the fibrillation mechanism of HEWL is not well understood. In particular, in situ structural evidence for the on-pathway oligomeric intermediate has never been captured. Such evidence is crucial for confirming nucleated conformational conversion mechanism. Herein, we attempt to use a two-step temperature-dependent Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) approach to capture the in situ evidence for the on-pathway oligomeric intermediate and the oligomer-to-fibril transition during HEWL fibrillation. Key features of this approach include using lower temperature to generate the on-pathway oligomeric intermediate, using elevated temperature to eliminate the interference from the off-pathway oligomer and to facilitate the oligomer-to-fibril transition, and using FTIR difference spectroscopy and atomic force microscopy to tackle structure and morphology. Using such an approach, we reveal that the on-pathway oligomeric intermediate is in parallel β-sheet configuration featuring a frequency at 1622 cm–¹ and the oligomer-to-fibril transition is accompanied by a spectral transition from 1622 to 1618 cm–¹. We also discover the beneficial role of the off-pathway oligomer in the capturing of the transient on-pathway oligomeric intermediate by serving as a monomer-releasing reservoir. This approach should also be useful in other amyloidogenic systems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aamyloid 3aatomic force microscopy 3aegg albumen 3ahens 3alysozyme 3aphysical chemistry 3atemperature1 aHao, Wenying1 aLi, Haoyi1 aGao, Yachao1 aSun, Ying1 aMa, Gang0 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2014 Aug. 21, v. 118, no. 33 p.9834-9843dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-52077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fjp504201k3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02351naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002600139245009600165300001800261520132300279592002801602650002701630650002201657650001401679650001801693650001801711650002101729650002301750650002601773700002101799773012101820856007501941852000902016655001202025IND60559228420221119064735.0161201e20140821xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055922842DNAL7 a10.1021/jp504243e2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFortunato, Michael
E.10aEffects of Galactosylation in Immunoglobulin G from All-Atom Molecular Dynamics Simulations  ap. 9844-9851.  aExplicit water atomistic molecular dynamics simulations (200 ns, ∼330 000 atoms) were performed to study the effects of galactosylation in the Fc domain of immunoglobulin G1. Two glycoforms were simulated to observe changes in protein–carbohydrate interactions and carbohydrate structure. A high degree of flexibility was observed in the small hinge region of the protein, while large domains remained stable. The hinge region flexibility allowed both translation and rotation of the domains relative to each other, resulting in a large number of possible conformations available. The distributions of rotational orientations between the Fₐb1 and Fₐb2 domains showed that while these domains are able to orient themselves rather freely pointing in space they rotated in unison to remain rotationally oriented at specific angles. Additionally, removing specific terminal galactose residues increased the mobility of the carbohydrate, resulting in different protein–carbohydrate interactions. Glycosylation has been suggested as a route to improve the aggregation resistance of monoclonal antibodies for therapeutic treatments to aid the immune system. The results presented here may provide insight into the search for IgG molecules with increased aggregation resistance to be used as monoclonal antibodies.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbohydrate structure 3achemical elements 3agalactose 3aglycosylation 3aimmune system 3aimmunoglobulin G 3amolecular dynamics 3amonoclonal antibodies1 aColina, Coray M.0 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2014 Aug. 21, v. 118, no. 33 p.9844-9851dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-52077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fjp504243e3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02308naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002100152245008000173300001800253520120300271592002801474650002201502650001601524650001701540650001001557650001101567650001201578650002601590650001801616700002501634700002901659700002101688700002201709700001901731773012001750856005501870852000901925655001201934IND4510072220221118020832.0150730e20020601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND451007222DNAL7 a10.1046/j.1432-1033.2002.02951.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDi Natale, Paola10aIn vitro gene therapy of mucopolysaccharidosis type I by lentiviral vectors  ap. 2764-2771.  aMucopolysaccharidosis typeâI (MPSâI) results from a deficiency in the enzyme Î±âlâiduronidase (IDUA), and is characterized by skeletal abnormalities, hepatosplenomegaly and neurological dysfunction.

We observed that the level of enzyme expression in transduced cells was 1.5âfold the level found in normal cells; the expression persisted for at least two months. In addition, transduced MPSâI fibroblasts were capable of clearing intracellular radiolabeled glycosaminoglycan (GAG).

This is based on the premise that the press' role as information disseminator can be strategic to the sustainable development paradigm. The study employs a generalized method of moment technique and a bias corrected fixed effects estimator within a panel dataset of 153 countries over the 2002 to 2016 study period. The present study finds that when the moderation effect of industry is not controlled for, a 1% increase press freedom is associated with a 0.022% decrease in CO₂ emissions. When the non-linear effect of internet access is not controlled for, a 1% increase in internet access is associated with a 0.018% increase in CO₂ emissions. With the incorporation of non-linearities, internet access has an inverted U-shape relationship with CO₂ emissions with a required access penetration of 76.2% before its carbon mitigation threshold can be attained. Also, press freedom constrains emissions in economies with a small industry size but induces emissions in economies with a large industry size. Sub-sample estimations show inter-alia —that while internet access is environmentally degrading in lower-middle income countries, it mitigates pollution in high income countries. Policy implications include the improvement of internet access penetration on a global scale to attain the threshold required to counterbalance the effect of global warming as well as engaging media stakeholders on the need to identify with cleaner production practices and transmission of same practices to the greater society in order to enhance sustainable development.  aPublisher supplied data 3aInternet 3acarbon 3acarbon dioxide 3adata collection 3aempirical research 3aenvironmental impact 3aincome 3aindustry 3aissues and policy 3apollution 3astakeholders 3asustainable development 0aPress freedom 0aInternet access 0aCO2 emissions 0aSTIRPAT model 0aGMM 0aBootstrap corrected fixed effects1 aJaff, Yvette Dufola1 aAghazadeh, Sahar0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2022 Mar. 10, v. 339 p.130719-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2022.1307193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03500naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001600153245013500169300001400304520211200318592002802430650001002458650002102468650001002489650001202499650001302511650001102524650001402535650002602549650002202575650001302597650001402610650000902624650001302633653002602646653001602672653002302688653006202711653002102773700002402794700001802818773010902836856008802945852000903033655001203042IND60637456020221118034815.0190606e201907  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063745602DNAL7 a10.1016/j.forsciint.2019.04.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRab, Edmund10aDetection of fentanyl and fentanyl analogues in biological samples using liquid chromatography–high resolution mass spectrometry  ap. 13-18.  aFentanyl and analogues such as butyrylfentanyl, carfentanil, 4-fluorobutyrylfentanyl, and furanylfentanyl may be either added to, or sold as, heroin. Fentanyl and carfentanil have approximately 100 and 10,000 times the potency of morphine, respectively, and there is thus a high risk of death with the use of these drugs.We looked for fentanyl/fentanyl analogues using liquid chromatography–high resolution mass spectrometry (LC–HRMS) in selected biological samples obtained post-mortem February 2017-end January 2018. Suspicion of fentanyl poisoning arose from the circumstances of death, a history of heroin use, and the geographical area in which the deceased was discovered, supplemented by drugs intelligence data.Of the 84 deaths investigated, fentanyl and/or a fentanyl analogue were detected in 40 (48%). The fentanyls encountered were carfentanil (N = 17), fentanyl (9), carfentanil and fentanyl together (12), and fentanyl, carfentanil, 4-fluorobutyrylfentanyl, and butyrylfentanyl together (2). The median (range) post-mortem blood fentanyl concentration was 2.66 (0.21–107) μg/L and the median (range) carfentanil concentration was 0.24 (0.03–1.66) μg/L. The most prevalent compounds present together with fentanyls were ethanol [N = 28, median (range) post-mortem blood concentration: 44 (<10–249) mg/dL)], benzoylecgonine [N = 22, 0.64 (<0.05–3.17) mg/L] and free morphine [N = 20, 0.05 (<0.05–0.34) mg/L]. Deaths in hospital excluded, median blood free morphine, and ethanol concentrations were significantly lower in deaths where fentanyl/fentanyl analogues were present, but there was much overlap with the blood concentrations of these analytes in the non-fentanyl related deaths. A routine drugs of abuse assay using LC–HRMS identified fentanyl with 100% sensitivity and carfentanil with 89% sensitivity.Given their potency, misuse of fentanyl and its analogues is likely to cause severe toxicity. A simple LC–HRMS method detected all cases in which fentanyl was identified post-mortem and most of the cases in which carfentanil was detected.  aPublisher supplied data 3ablood 3achemical species 3adeath 3aethanol 3afentanyl 3aheroin 3ahospitals 3aliquid chromatography 3amass spectrometry 3amorphine 3apoisoning 3arisk 3atoxicity 0aHeroin-related deaths 0aCarfentanil 0aFentanyl analogues 0aLiquid chromatography–high resolution mass spectrometry 0aSubstance misuse1 aFlanagan, Robert J.1 aHudson, Simon0 tForensic science international.g2019 July, v. 300 p.13-18dElsevier B.V.wJournal:3523x0379-07387nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.forsciint.2019.04.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03973naa a2200697 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001500150245010700165300001400272520204600286592002802332650002002360650002002380650001302400650001502413650002602428650001702454650001902471650001802490650001202508650001202520650001302532650002202545650000902567650001002576650001702586650001802603650001502621650002402636650002502660650000902685650001202694650001802706650001302724650002102737650002502758650002002783650001402803650001602817650001402833650001402847650002202861650002302883650001102906651001002917653003602927653002602963653002102989653001903010653002603029700001603055700002003071773007903091856008403170852000903254655001203263IND60546761220221122074343.0160903e201511  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054676122DNAL7 a10.1016/j.wasman.2015.06.0412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Ting12aA safety analysis of food waste-derived animal feeds from three typical conversion techniques in China  ap. 42-50.  aThis study was based on the food waste to animal feed demonstration projects in China. A safety analysis of animal feeds from three typical treatment processes (i.e., fermentation, heat treatment, and coupled hydrothermal treatment and fermentation) was presented. The following factors are considered in this study: nutritive values characterized by organoleptic properties and general nutritional indices; the presence of bovine- and sheep-derived materials; microbiological indices for Salmonella, total coliform (TC), total aerobic plate counts (TAC), molds and yeast (MY), Staphylococcus Aureus (SA), and Listeria; chemical contaminant indices for hazardous trace elements such as Cr, Cd, and As; and nitrite and organic contaminants such as aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) and hexachlorocyclohexane (HCH).The present study reveals that the feeds from all three conversion processes showed balanced nutritional content and retained a certain feed value. The microbiological indices and the chemical contaminant indices for HCH, dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT), nitrite, and mercury all met pertinent feed standards; however, the presence of bovine- and sheep-derived materials and a few chemical contaminants such as Pb were close to or might exceed the legislation permitted values in animal feeding. From the view of treatment techniques, all feed retained part of the nutritional values of the food waste after the conversion processes. Controlled heat treatment can guarantee the inactivation of bacterial pathogens, but none of the three techniques can guarantee the absence of cattle- and sheep-derived materials and acceptable levels of certain contaminants.The results obtained in this research and the feedstuffs legislation related to animal feed indicated that food waste-derived feed could be considered an adequate alternative to be used in animal diets, while the feeding action should be changed with the different qualities of the products, such as restrictions on the application of ruminants, and recycling as formula feeds.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDDT (pesticide) 3aHCH (pesticide) 3aListeria 3aSalmonella 3aStaphylococcus aureus 3aaflatoxin B1 3aanimal feeding 3aanimal wastes 3aarsenic 3acadmium 3achromium 3acoliform bacteria 3adiet 3afeeds 3afermentation 3afood analysis 3afood waste 3ahot water treatment 3alaws and regulations 3alead 3amercury 3amolds (fungi) 3anitrites 3anutrient content 3anutrition assessment 3anutritive value 3apathogens 3aplate count 3arecycling 3aruminants 3asafety assessment 3asensory properties 3ayeasts 3aChina 0aFood waste-derived animal feeds 0aConversion techniques 0aNutritive values 0aMicroorganisms 0aChemical contaminants1 aJin, Yiying1 aShen, Dongsheng0 tWaste management.g2015 Nov., v. 45 p.42-50dElsevier Ltdx0956-053X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2015.06.0413Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02927naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245008800171520160800259592002801867650001501895650001301910650002301923650002301946650003401969650002402003650001902027650001302046653002702059653002802086653002302114653002402137653002502161653002502186700005902211700001802270700002102288773011302309856008602422852000902508655001202517IND60766426420221117042356.0221004e20220315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076642642DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2022.1307232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDorosti, Peiman13aAn adaptive protection coordination scheme for microgrids with optimum PV resources  aNowadays, microgrids provide several economic and environmental benefits for customers, investors, and power networks. Their practical implementation, however, has several technical challenges such as energy management, control, and protection. The protection coordination is a crucial problem in microgrids with high penetration of renewable-based distributed generations such as photovoltaic units. In previous studies, despite the network's need for maximum photovoltaic resources, the installed capacity of these resources was assumed to be constant and limited due to the miscoordination of protective devices as a result of increasing network short-circuit level. This paper presents an optimal adaptive protection coordination scheme in microgrids with optimum penetration levels of photovoltaic resources without dependency on communication infrastructures, such as ways of communication between relays and central control room for analyzing all relay signals depends on fault condition and changing the setting step in adaptive relays. The proposed methodology can generally increase the penetration level of photovoltaic resources while minimizing the generation costs of photovoltaic resources by optimizing the installation capacity of each bus. The proposed adaptive protection coordination is achieved without changing the settings of existing protective devices. The optimal capacity of photovoltaic resources is updated through optimization algorithms such as non-dominate storing genetic algorithm considering several constraints including loss and cost minimization and voltage limits.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3acleaning 3aconsumers (people) 3aecosystem services 3aelectric potential difference 3afinancial economics 3ainfrastructure 3ajournals 0aPhotovoltaic resources 0aProtection coordination 0aNSGA-III algorithm 0aAdaptive protection 0aDistribution systems 0aRenewable generators1 aMoazzami, Majid1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2780-36771 aFani, Bahador1 aSiano, Pierluigi0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2022 Mar. 15, v. 340 p.130723-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2022.1307233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02647naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100001400188245012800202300001600330506007600346520129700422592002801719506003701747650002301784650001501807650002501822650001401847650002001861650001401881653003001895653001901925653001801944653001201962653003001974700001602004700002302020773009202043856008102135852000902216655001202225IND60544688420221207125816.0160901e20140102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054468842DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aca.2013.10.0502doi7 aPMC38848252pmcid7 a243310472pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHao, Ming13aAn efficient algorithm coupled with synthetic minority over-sampling technique to classify imbalanced PubChem BioAssay data  ap. 117-127.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aIt is common that imbalanced datasets are often generated from high-throughput screening (HTS). For a given dataset without taking into account the imbalanced nature, most classification methods tend to produce high predictive accuracy for the majority class, but significantly poor performance for the minority class. In this work, an efficient algorithm, GLMBoost, coupled with Synthetic Minority Over-sampling TEchnique (SMOTE) is developed and utilized to overcome the problem for several imbalanced datasets from PubChem BioAssay. By applying the proposed combinatorial method, those data of rare samples (active compounds), for which usually poor results are generated, can be detected apparently with high balanced accuracy (Gmean). As a comparison with GLMBoost, Random Forest (RF) combined with SMOTE is also adopted to classify the same datasets. Our results show that the former (GLMBoost+SMOTE) not only exhibits higher performance as measured by the percentage of correct classification for the rare samples (Sensitivity) and Gmean, but also demonstrates greater computational efficiency than the latter (RF+SMOTE). Therefore, we hope that the proposed combinatorial algorithm based on GLMBoost and SMOTE could be extensively used to tackle the imbalanced classification problem.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aactive ingredients 3aalgorithms 3aanalytical chemistry 3abioassays 3adata collection 3ascreening 0aHigh-throughput screening 0aUnder-sampling 0aOver-sampling 0aPubChem 0aImbalanced classification1 aWang, Yanli1 aBryant, Stephen H.0 tAnalytica chimica acta.g2014 Jan. 02, v. 806 p.117-127dElsevier B.V.x0003-26707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aca.2013.10.0503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03037naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002700146245009100173300001600264520133600280536027601616592002801892650001401920650002701934650001701961650001501978650001301993650002502006650001702031650001202048650001002060651001202070651001202082651001102094651001202105651001002117651001902127653001002146653001802156653001402174653001102188653001402199653001302213700002002226700002302246700002002269700001802289773011102307856008002418852000902498655001202507IND60620932720221120065752.0181114e201405  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062093272DNAL7 a10.1177/00027642135159922doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCammaerts, B.q(Bart),14aThe Myth of Youth ApathybYoung Europeans’ Critical Attitudes Toward Democratic Life  ap. 645-664.  aA common interpretation of the low levels of electoral turnout among young voters is that they are apathetic and part of a generation that does not care about political issues—indeed, a selfish and materialistic generation. In this article, the authors question this common perception and test this claim against an important alternative: that the limitations to youth participation in Europe are due not to a lack of interest in the public good but rather to a combination of contextual and psychosocial factors, including the real as well as perceived inadequacy of the existing political offer. The authors assessed young people’s attitudes toward democratic life in the United Kingdom, France, Spain, Austria, Finland, and Hungary. A mixture of a comparative mass survey, stakeholder interviews, an experiment, and focus groups was used. The data suggest that young people are willing to engage politically but are turned off by the focus and nature of existing mainstream political discourse and practice, which many believe excludes them and ignores their needs and interests. Contrary to the assumptions of the disaffected and apathetic citizen approach, there is a strong desire among many young Europeans to participate in democratic life, but this desire is not met by existing democratic institutions and discourses.  aFunding The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: European Commission (Education, Audiovisual and Culture Executive Agency), Youth Participation in Democratic Life (EACEA/2010/03).  aPublisher supplied data 3aEuropeans 3aattitudes and opinions 3afocus groups 3ainterviews 3apolitics 3apsychosocial factors 3astakeholders 3asurveys 3ayouth 3aAustria 3aFinland 3aFrance 3aHungary 3aSpain 3aUnited Kingdom 0ayouth 0aparticipation 0ademocracy 0aapathy 0aelections 0aactivism1 aBruter, Michael1 aBanaji, Shakuntala1 aHarrison, Sarah1 aAnstead, Nick0 tAmerican behavioral scientist.g, v. 58, no. 5 p.645-664dSAGE PublicationswJournal:2328x1552-33817nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/00027642135159923Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03306naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094024002200130024001900152040001800171100005700189245011600246300001600362506007600378520165100454592002802105596011202133506003702245650001502282650001502297650001102312650001902323650002602342650001302368650001902381650001002400650001802410650001202428650002602440650001302466650001102479650001702490650001002507650001302517650001402530700002102544700002602565773011702591856008302708852000902791655001202800IND60637790720221207143301.0190710e201905  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063779072DNAL7 a10.1007/s12550-019-00342-22doi7 aPMC64786272pmcid7 a307103172pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMendel, Marta1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0202-216914aThe impact of chlorophyllin on deoxynivalenol transport across jejunum mucosa explants obtained from adult pigs  ap. 187-196.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aRegardless of the efforts put into preventing or reducing fungal growth, extensive mycotoxin contamination has been reported in animal feeds. In the case of pigs, one of the mycotoxins of major concern is deoxynivalenol (DON). The use of adsorbents as feed additives represents one of the strategies to control mycotoxins’ contamination in feedstuff. Therefore, the aim of the study was to verify the ability of chlorophyllin (CHL) to reduce the absorption rate of DON in swine mucosa explants. Intestine was obtained from routinely slaughtered adult pigs. The mucosa explants were studied by means of Ussing chamber technique. The effect of DON (10 and 30 μg/ml) on mucosa viability and permeability and CHL (100 μg/ml) impact on DON (30 μg/ml) absorption was verified. The results revealed that mucosa explants isolated from adult animals remained unaffected for 90 min in the presence of DON in the lower concentration (10 μg/ml). Mycotoxin in the higher dose (30 μg/ml) increased mucosa permeability (decreased transepithelial electrical resistance value) and enhanced paracellular transport of lucifer yellow and mannitol but did not affect lactate dehydrogenase leakage. The introduction of CHL neither diminished the absorption rate of DON across swine mucosa explants nor prevented the toxic effects of DON on intestine. In conclusion, the results confirm the negative effect of DON on pig jejunum mucosa. However, the toxic effect of DON was observed only when it was used in relatively high doses. A promising adsorbent agent, CHL, failed to reduce the intensity of DON transport across intestine under in vitro conditions.  aPublisher supplied data  a05-1/KNOW2/2015cKNOW (Leading National Research Centre) Scientific Consortium "Healthy Animal - Safe Food"0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aabsorption 3aadsorbents 3aadults 3adeoxynivalenol 3aelectrical resistance 3aexplants 3afeed additives 3afeeds 3afungal growth 3ajejunum 3alactate dehydrogenase 3amannitol 3amucosa 3apermeability 3aswine 3atoxicity 3aviability1 aKarlik, Wojciech1 aChłopecka, Magdalena0 tMycotoxin research.g2019 May, v. 35, no. 2 p.187-196dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:1993x0178-78887nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12550-019-00342-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03487naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001500150245009300165300001600258520230500274592002802579650001502607650000902622650002802631650001502659650001602674650001402690650002402704650002202728650000902750653001902759653002002778653001702798653002102815700001502836700001402851700001302865700001302878773008102891856008402972852000903056655001203065IND60546761420221122072044.0160903e201510  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054676142DNAL7 a10.1016/j.wasman.2015.06.0422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNg, C.W.W.10aGas breakthrough and emission through unsaturated compacted clay in landfill final cover  ap. 155-163.  aDetermination of gas transport parameters in compacted clay plays a vital role for evaluating the effectiveness of soil barriers. The gas breakthrough pressure has been widely studied for saturated swelling clay buffer commonly used in high-level radioactive waste disposal facility where the generated gas pressure is very high (in the order of MPa). However, compacted clay in landfill cover is usually unsaturated and the generated landfill gas pressure is normally low (typically less than 10kPa). Furthermore, effects of clay thickness and degree of saturation on gas breakthrough and emission rate in the context of unsaturated landfill cover has not been quantitatively investigated in previous studies. The feasibility of using unsaturated compacted clay as gas barrier in landfill covers is thus worthwhile to be explored over a wide range of landfill gas pressures under various degrees of saturation and clay thicknesses. In this study, to evaluate the effectiveness of unsaturated compacted clay to minimize gas emission, one-dimensional soil column tests were carried out on unsaturated compacted clay to determine gas breakthrough pressures at ultimate limit state (high pressure range) and gas emission rates at serviceability limit state (low pressure range). Various degrees of saturation and thicknesses of unsaturated clay sample were considered. Moreover, numerical simulations were carried out using a coupled gas–water flow finite element program (CODE-BRIGHT) to better understand the experimental results by extending the clay thickness and varying the degree of saturation to a broader range that is typical at different climate conditions. The results of experimental study and numerical simulation reveal that as the degree of saturation and thickness of clay increase, the gas breakthrough pressure increases but the gas emission rate decreases significantly. Under a gas pressure of 10kPa (the upper bound limit of typical landfill gas pressure), a 0.6m or thicker compacted clay is able to prevent gas breakthrough at degree of saturation of 60% or above (in humid regions). Furthermore, to meet the limit of gas emission rate set by the Australian guideline, a 0.6m-thick clay layer may be sufficient even at low degree of saturation (i.e., 10% like in arid regions).  aPublisher supplied data 3aarid zones 3aclay 3afinite element analysis 3aguidelines 3ahumid zones 3alandfills 3amathematical models 3aradioactive waste 3asoil 0aLandfill cover 0a1-D soil column 0aGas emission 0aGas breakthrough1 aChen, Z.K.1 aCoo, J.L.1 aChen, R.1 aZhou, C.0 tWaste management.g2015 Oct., v. 44 p.155-163dElsevier Ltdx0956-053X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2015.06.0423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03999naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002300151245018900174300001800363500001400381520225500395536011802650592002802768596002602796650001502822650002302837650001402860650001102874650001602885650000902901650002002910650001602930650002002946650001202966650002302978650002003001650001803021650001203039650001003051650001703061650001303078650001003091650001403101650001203115653001503127653001203142653001903154700003003173700002003203773012803223856008503351852000903436655001203445IND60694502120221118061210.0200513e20190102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069450212DNAL7 a10.1080/1828051X.2019.16158512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNazarizadeh, Hasan10aEffect of plant extracts derived from thyme and chamomile on the growth performance, gut morphology and immune system of broilers fed aflatoxin B₁ and ochratoxin A contaminated diets  ap. 1073-1081.  aNAL-light  aThis study was conducted to evaluate the ability of chamomile flower extract (CFE) and thyme-oil extract (TOE) for the preventing effect of ochratoxin A (OTA) and aflatoxin B₁ (AFB) in broiler productivity, biochemical parameters, gut morphology and immune response of broilers. The experiment was conducted as a 3 × 4 factorial arrangement, being the factors: phytogenic additives (control, 3 g/kg diet of CFE, or 3 g/kg diet of TOE) and dietary contaminated diets (none, 0.50 mg/kg diet of AFB, 0.25 mg/kg diet of OTA, or 0.50 mg/kg diet of AFB + 0.25 mg/kg diet of OTA). Each of the 12 dietary treatments was fed to six replicate pens (10 birds/pen) from 0 to 28 d of age. Inclusion of phytogenic additives increased average daily gain (ADG) and average daily feed intake (ADFI), and decreased feed conversion ratio (FCR) from day 11 to 28 and day 0 to 28 in the birds fed OTA-AFB toxin diets. Significantly increased levels of HDL, IgG, IgM and anti-Newcastle disease virus (NDV) antibody titre were observed in the two essential oil-treated groups when compared with the control group. When compared with the control, relative weights of gizzard, liver and pancreas were significantly higher for broilers fed diets containing OTA alone. The results indicated that OTA and AFB toxins, alone or in combination, reduced villous height (VH) and ratio of VH to crypt depth in the jejunum. The levels of triglycerides, total cholesterol, HDL and plasma immunoglobulin, as well as NDV antibody titre were significantly decreased by AFB-OTA toxin combination. In summary, the combination of OTA and AFB impaired chick immune function even at combined concentrations as low as 0.25 mg/kg diet of OTA and 0.50 mg/kg diet of AFB. The inclusion of TOE and CFE can be an alternative to ameliorate the adverse effects of low doses of AFB and OTA in broiler diets.HighlightsOchratoxin A and aflatoxin B₁, alone or in combination, affect negatively productive performance and immune function. Dietary inclusion of chamomile flower extract (CFE) and thyme-oil extract (TOE) had positive effects on growth performance and immune response. Addition of CFE and TOE to diets can ameliorate the adverse effects of mycotoxins in broiler diets.  aThis research was partially supported by Vice Chancellor in Research and Technology of the University of Birjand.  aPublisher supplied data  cUniversity of Birjand 3aantibodies 3aaverage daily gain 3achamomile 3achicks 3acholesterol 3adiet 3afeed conversion 3afeed intake 3aflower extracts 3agizzard 3agrowth performance 3aimmune response 3aimmune system 3ajejunum 3aliver 3aochratoxin A 3apancreas 3athyme 3athyme oil 3aviruses 0aMycotoxins 0abroiler 0aessential oils1 aMohammad Hosseini, Seyyed1 aPourreza, Javad0 tItalian journal of animal science.g2019 Jan. 2, v. 18, no. 1 p.1073-1081dTaylor & FranciswJournal:11638x1828-051X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/1828051X.2019.16158513Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02944naa a2200781 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002600147245007500173300001400248520111400262592002801376650002501404650001201429650001501441650002301456650001101479650001301490650002901503650001701532650001601549653001501565653002301580653001701603653001601620653001501636653002101651653000801672653001001680653000701690653000801697653000801705653000801713653000801721653000901729653000801738653000901746653001201755653000901767653001201776653000801788653000801796653000701804653000801811653000701819653000901826653000801835653000701843653000701850653000801857653000901865653000801874653000901882653000901891653000801900653000801908653000701916653000901923653001101932700002701943773009001970856008102060852000902141655001202150IND60544688520221120095228.0160901e20140102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054468852DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aca.2013.10.0532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLuque de Castro, M.D.10aUltrasound: A subexploited tool for sample preparation in metabolomics  ap. 74-84.  aMetabolomics, one of the most recently emerged “omics”, has taken advantage of ultrasound (US) to improve sample preparation (SP) steps. The metabolomics–US assisted SP step binomial has experienced a dissimilar development that has depended on the area (vegetal or animal) and the SP step. Thus, vegetal metabolomics and US assisted leaching has received the greater attention (encompassing subdisciplines such as metallomics, xenometabolomics and, mainly, lipidomics), but also liquid–liquid extraction and (bio)chemical reactions in metabolomics have taken advantage of US energy. Also clinical and animal samples have benefited from US assisted SP in metabolomics studies but in a lesser extension. The main effects of US have been shortening of the time required for the given step, and/or increase of its efficiency or availability for automation; nevertheless, attention paid to potential degradation caused by US has been scant or nil. Achievements and weak points of the metabolomics–US assisted SP step binomial are discussed and possible solutions to the present shortcomings are exposed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanalytical chemistry 3aanimals 3aautomation 3achemical reactions 3aenergy 3aleaching 3aliquid-liquid extraction 3ametabolomics 3aultrasonics 0aUltrasound 0aSample preparation 0aMetabolomics 0aMetallomics 0aLipidomics 0aXenometabolomics 0aAOA 0aBSTFA 0aCE 0aDAD 0aDMB 0aEDP 0aEFA 0aFAAS 0aFID 0aFRAP 0aGC–MS 0aHPLC 0aLC–MS 0aLIF 0aLLE 0aMS 0aMAE 0aMW 0aNEFA 0aNMR 0aPL 0aSE 0aSFE 0aSHLE 0aSPE 0aTEAC 0aTMCS 0aTOF 0aTPC 0aUS 0aUSAL 0aUSALLE1 aDelgado-Povedano, M.M.0 tAnalytica chimica acta.g2014 Jan. 02, v. 806 p.74-84dElsevier B.V.x0003-26707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aca.2013.10.0533Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02370naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245011600169300001600285520129500301592002801596650002701624650001101651650001401662650002201676650001901698651001201717653002301729653002001752653001501772653001401787653002101801653001201822773008101834856008401915852000901999655001202008IND60546761520221122164943.0160903e201510  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054676152DNAL7 a10.1016/j.wasman.2015.06.0442doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLakhan, Calvin10aNorth of the 46° parallel: Obstacles and challenges to recycling in Ontario’s rural and northern communities  ap. 216-226.  aThis study examines the economic challenges of recycling in Ontario’s rural and northern areas. Specifically, this study quantifies the economic and diversion impact of operating recycling programs in these regions. Using a systems based cost model, focus is placed on analyzing: (1) What would happen to provincial recycling costs and diversion levels if recycling programs were eliminated in “high cost” northern and rural communities? (2) Is it possible to increase the provincial recycling rate by focusing investments in low cost, high performance regions (while simultaneously eliminating recycling programs in rural and northern areas)? (3) How would the mix of material recovered change if recycling programs were eliminated in rural and northern areas? The results of this analysis show that eliminating recycling programs in high cost regions significantly decreased system costs without negatively impacting overall recycling rates. This study also found that it was possible to increase the provincial recycling rate while simultaneously reducing program costs by targeting specific regions for recovery. The findings of this study suggest that Ontario reevaluate whether rural and northern municipalities be legislatively required to operate household recycling programs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenvironmental programs 3amodels 3arecycling 3arural communities 3arural programs 3aOntario 0aNorthern recycling 0aRural recycling 0aCost model 0aDiversion 0aCost containment 0aOntario0 tWaste management.g2015 Oct., v. 44 p.216-226dElsevier Ltdx0956-053X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2015.06.0443Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02999naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002900092024002200121024001900143040001800162100001700180245013500197300001800332506007600350520168300426592002802109506003702137650001202174650001902186650002502205650001502230650001102245650001102256650001402267650001302281650002302294650003002317700001502347700001702362773012202379856007902501852000902580655001202589IND4501637520221207125643.0150427e20111001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND450163752DNAL7 a10.1128/JB.05227-112doi7 aPMC31874672pmcid7 a218039972pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCai, Shichun10aCBM3d, a Novel Subfamily of Family 3 Carbohydrate-Binding Modules Identified in Cel48A Exoglucanase of Cellulosilyticum ruminicola  ap. 5199-5206.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aPreviously, we found that exoglucanase Cel48A from Cellulosilyticum ruminicola H1 bound intensively to Avicel; however, no known carbohydrate-binding module (CBM) was observed in the protein. Bioinformatics suggested that a C-terminal fragment of 127 amino acids, named the Cellulosilyticum-specific paralogous module (CPM), could function in binding. CPM-appended proteins are all putative (hemi)cellulases from Cellulosilyticum spp. In the present work, we demonstrated that Cel48A without the CPM retained only exoglucanase activity and lost the Avicel-binding ability, while the isolated CPM exhibited a high affinity for Avicel. In addition, the CPM bound to chitin, but not to soluble polysaccharides, making it a type A CBM, which binds only insoluble polysaccharides. Phylogenetic analysis clustered the CPM and its homologs as a separate branch that was distantly related to CBM subfamilies 3a (28% identity), 3b (24% identity), and 3c (21% identity). Sequence alignment revealed distinct secondary structures of the new CBM 3 group, in particular, a conserved Pro66-Trp67 insert preceding strand Î²4', a deletion preceding strand Î²6, and incomplete strands Î²8 and Î²9. An alanine scan for six aromatic and three nonaromatic amino acid residues (D66, P66, and R111) by site-directed mutagenesis determined that Phe62, Pro66, Trp67, Tyr68, Arg111, and Trp117 were the functional residues for binding. Among them, Phe62, Pro66, and Trp67 were the newly determined key sites in the CPM for binding. Three-dimensional homolog modeling revealed two types of substrate-binding sites, planar and groove, in the CPM. Thus, a new subfamily, CBM family 3d, is proposed.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aalanine 3abioinformatics 3acarbohydrate binding 3acellulases 3achitin 3amodels 3aphylogeny 3aproteins 3asequence alignment 3asite-directed mutagenesis1 aZheng, Xin1 aDong, Xiuzhu0 tJournal of bacteriology.g2011 Oct. 1, v. 193, no. 19 p.5199-5206dAmerican Society for Microbiologyx0021-91937nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1128/JB.05227-113Available from publisher's Web site  aDNAL 7aarticle02493naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002500151245011400176520118200290592002801472650001101500650001901511650002501530650001401555650001101569650002001580650001901600650001801619650002001637650001101657650001101668653001901679653002901698653001401727653001101741653001701752653001801769700001901787700001701806700001601823773011301839856008601952852000902038655001202047IND60766426820221117041403.0221004e20220315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076642682DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2022.1307352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHassan, Syed Tauseef10aEnvironmental complexity of globalization, education, and income inequalities: New insights of energy poverty  aIn the coming decades, the energy industry will be confronted with developments related to three significant phenomena: climate change, energy security, and energy poverty. The first two have been widely studied, but less attention has been paid to the third, although it has a significant impact on the lives of millions of people in terms of healthcare, education, environmental concerns, and other socio-economic factors. Therefore, we estimated the effects of energy poverty, education, income inequalities, and globalisation on carbon emissions in BRICS countries between 1989 and 2016. We used continuously updated fully modified and continuously updated biased correction approaches, as well as the common correlated effects mean group and augmented mean group estimators to obtain model estimations that were robust against cross-country dependencies and heterogeneity. The empirical results revealed that economic growth, income inequalities, and energy poverty increased the environmental pressure on BRICS countries. However, the expansion and improvement of education had an impact, directly and indirectly, on the investigated variables and promoted globalisation.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3aclimate change 3aeconomic development 3aeducation 3aenergy 3aenergy industry 3aenergy poverty 3aglobalization 3ahealth services 3aincome 3apeople 0aEnergy poverty 0aEnvironmental complexity 0aEducation 0aIncome 0aInequalities 0aGlobalisation1 aBatool, Bushra1 aZhu, Bangzhu1 aKhan, Irfan0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2022 Mar. 15, v. 340 p.130735-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2022.1307353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02808naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100005900147245012500206300001600331520126300347592002801610650001901638650002801657650001201685650001301697650001201710650001701722650001601739650001001755650001501765650002201780650002001802650000901822650001001831650001701841650002701858650002501885650002201910650001001932653001701942653001101959653001101970653000801981700002301989700001702012700006302029773010702092856008202199852000902281655001202290IND60637456520221118034831.0190606e201905  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063745652DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcs.2019.04.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTamene, Aynadis1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4604-818710aQuantification of folate in the main steps of traditional processing of tef injera, a cereal based fermented staple food  ap. 225-230.  aInjera is an Ethiopian fermented flatbread preferably made from whole grain cereal (tef). Tef it is increasingly used to produce gluten-free pasta and bread, but the folate content of teff and products made from it remains unknown. Given that folate deficiencies lead to several health disorders, the aim of this study was to quantify folate in each of the three main steps of traditional processing of tef injera. Total folate contents of tef flour, fermented batter and injera were determined through microbiological assays using Lactobacillus rhamnosus (ATCC 7469). Folate content of tef flour was 8.7 μg/100 g of dry matter content, which is in the same range as the richest cereals like oats. The increase in folate content due to fermentation was highly variable (60–148%). Cooking always led to folate losses, with a maximum of 52.8%. Altogether, injera processing increased folate retention between 38.0 and 121.8%. Folate content of injera was 14.3 μg/100 g on fresh weight-basis. Tef injera can contribute up to 10% of the recommended nutrient intake of folate for children aged 1–3 and women of reproductive age. Although the folate content of teff is already high, future studies should focus on optimizing the folate content of injera.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEragrostis tef 3aLactobacillus rhamnosus 3abatters 3achildren 3acooking 3afermentation 3aflat breads 3aflour 3afolic acid 3agluten-free foods 3anutrient intake 3aoats 3apasta 3astaple foods 3atraditional technology 3avitamin B deficiency 3awhole grain foods 3awomen 0aFermentation 0aFolate 0aInjera 0aTef1 aKariluoto, Susanna1 aBaye, Kaleab1 aHumblot, Christèle1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9797-16250 tJournal of cereal science.g2019 May, v. 87 p.225-230dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46803x0733-52107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcs.2019.04.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02612naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002300094024002200117024001900139040001800158100002500176245007000201300001500271520111700286592002801403650001501431650002101446650001901467650001401486650000901500650001101509650001601520650001601536650001301552650001401565650001501579650001401594650001301608650001001621700002201631700001601653700002201669700002001691700001901711700002001730773015201750856007001902856010201972990002302074852000902097655001202106IND60608571720221118141158.0190510e20171013xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060857172DNAL7 a10.3791/559932doi7 aPMC57524092pmcid7 a290536872pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBalne, Praveen Kumar10aBead based multiplex assay for analysis of tear cytokine profiles  ap. e55993.  aTear film is a complex mixture of lipids, proteins and minerals which covers the external surface of the eye, thereby providing lubrication, nutrition and protection to the underlying cells. Analysis of tears is an emerging area for the identification of biomarkers for the prediction, diagnosis, and prognosis of various ocular diseases. Tears are easily accessible and their collection is non-invasive. Therefore, advancing technologies are gaining prominence for identification of multiple analytes in tears to study changes in protein or metabolite composition and its association with pathological conditions. Tear cytokines are ideal biomarkers for studying the health of the ocular surface and also help in understanding the mechanisms of different ocular surface disorders like dry eye disease and vernal conjunctivitis. Bead based multiplex assays have the capability of detecting multiple analytes in a small amount of sample with a higher sensitivity. Here we describe a standardized protocol of tear sample collection, extraction and analysis of cytokine profiling using a bead based multiplex assay.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiomarkers 3achemical species 3aconjunctivitis 3acytokines 3aeyes 3alipids 3alubrication 3ametabolites 3aminerals 3anutrition 3aprediction 3aprognosis 3aproteins 3atears1 aAU, Veonice Bijin1 aTong, Louis1 aGhosh, Arkasubhra1 aAgrawal, Mukesh1 aConnolly, John1 aAgrawal, Rupesh0 tJournal of visualized experiments.g2017 Oct. 13, , no. 128 p.e55993-e55993dJournal of Visualized ExperimentswJournal:jnl4469330x1940-087X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3791/559933Available from publisher's site  uhttp://www.jove.com/video/55993/bead-based-multiplex-assay-for-analysis-of-tear-cytokine-profiles  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02760naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245013400167520142500301592002801726650001101754650002201765650001201787650001101799650001201810650000701822650001301829653001901842653003001861653002201891653003601913653003001949653003401979700001702013700001202030700005702042700001502099700001602114773011302130856008602243852000902329655001202338IND60766426920221117042321.0221004e20220315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076642692DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2022.1307412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDeng, Liyan10aPhotoelectrochemical and energy storage properties for metal sulfides regulated by biomineralization of sulfate reducing bacteria  aMetal sulfides have been utilized in many fields for their multiple electronic, optical, physical and chemical properties. It can be prepared through a low-cost and efficient method which relies on the reaction between S²⁻ produced by sulfate reducing bacteria (SRB) in the treating process of sulfate-containing wastewater and metal ions. These kinds of metal sulfides regulated by biomineralization possess promising application prospective for their photoelectrochemical and energy storage properties. In this study, three series of sulfide for Cu²⁺, Pb²⁺ and Zn²⁺ were prepared at pH values of 2.5–6.5. The corresponding properties of them were also determined. Results showed that metal sulfides prepared at diverse pH values were all nanoscale and low pH was more conducive to the precipitation of metal sulfides as well as the formation of crystals. Furthermore, a possible mechanism for biomineralization of SRB in preparing metal sulfides was proposed. It also should be noted that ZnS prepared in this study can efficiently photocatalyze the degradation of the pesticide Dicamba while CuS was more suitable for preparing lithium batteries as anode materials. This study not only provides a clean pathway to prepare metal sulfides but also helps us fully understand the properties of metal sulfides regulated by biomineralization of SRB which provides precondition for their practical application.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanodes 3abiomineralization 3adicamba 3aenergy 3alithium 3apH 3asulfates 0aMetal sulfides 0aSulfate reducing bacteria 0aBiomineralization 0aPhotoelectrochemical properties 0aEnergy storage properties 0aSulfate-containing wastewater1 aRen, Wanqing1 aLi, Min1 aWu, Changyong1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9474-59161 aQu, Aoxuan1 aWan, Chunli0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2022 Mar. 15, v. 340 p.130741-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2022.1307413Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02957naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245008100170300001600251520160600267592002801873650001701901650001601918650001201934650002201946650001201968650001301980650002101993650002102014650001702035650001302052650000902065650001102074650002502085650001402110650002502124653001502149653003102164653001602195653002502211700002202236700002402258700001902282773008102301856008402382852000902466655001202475IND60546761820221120102621.0160903e201510  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054676182DNAL7 a10.1016/j.wasman.2015.07.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMuzyka, Roksana10aPreliminary studies on the treatment of wastewater from biomass gasification  ap. 135-146.  aThis paper presents completed research on the purification of undiluted raw water and organic condensates obtained in biomass thermal conversion processes such as gasification, which are rarely addressed in published studies. However, similar studies involving the characterization and purification of aqueous solutions obtained from process gas treatment after the gasification of biomass are available. Condensation of water–organic condensate from process gas helps to reduce the amount of water required by the purification process and the cost of the process technology and water consumption. Oil scrubbers can be used in this case instead of water scrubbers. In this case, the obtained condensate must be subjected to purification processes. This paper presents the results of our research, possible methods of treatment (chemical and biological methods), and the approximate cost of the reagents required for the purification of condensate for specific assumed degrees of purification.The best results from the chemical purification using the Fenton method were obtained with the ratio VH2O2/Vcond.=6.0 and the ratio VH2O2Fe=0.0375. To prevent precipitation of ferric hydroxide, this value can be reduced 20-fold, which reduces the total degree of purification to 90%. The cost of almost complete cleaning of tested condensates was calculated to be approximately 2000USDper/m3. This cost can be reduced by a factor of approximately four assuming 100% cleaning for 2-furaldehyde, furfuryl alcohol and phenol; acetaldehyde, propane-2-one (acetone), methanol and acetic acid are oxidized by 50%.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetaldehyde 3aacetic acid 3aacetone 3aaqueous solutions 3abiomass 3acleaning 3aferric hydroxide 3afurfuryl alcohol 3agasification 3amethanol 3aoils 3aphenol 3apurification methods 3ascrubbers 3awastewater treatment 0aWastewater 0aWater–organic condensate 0aUtilization 0aGasification biomass1 aChrubasik, Maciej1 aStelmach, Sławomir1 aSajdak, Marcin0 tWaste management.g2015 Oct., v. 44 p.135-146dElsevier Ltdx0956-053X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2015.07.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03977naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100006800151245011800219520227800337592002802615650002702643650001502670650001302685650002402698650001302722650002402735650001202759650001202771650001702783650001102800650001002811650000902821650001502830650001602845650001902861650001802880651001002898653003402908653003502942653003602977653003203013653001603045653001903061700005203080700001703132700001503149700001103164700005203175773011303227856008603340852000903426655001203435IND60766427120221117041855.0221004e20220315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076642712DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2022.1307432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMarín Del Valle, Tomás1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2683-089210aSpatiotemporal dynamics and resource use efficiency in mariculture production: A case study in Southeastern China  aThe rapid expansion of marine aquaculture poses a big challenge for sustainable development. More efficient production strategies are necessary to ensure a sustainable mariculture sector, yet the potential of feasible production gains without further environmental impacts is largely unknown. This work took one of the biggest mariculture centers in China to analyze the spatiotemporal dynamics of mariculture products in 2003, 2010, and 2016, explore potential factors associated with resource use efficiency, and quantify the potential of these factors to increase regional production. The mariculture sector had a rapid expansion in 2003–2010 and accelerated product diversification in 2010–2016, with overall annual growth rates of 4.6%, 24.9%, 14.6%, 20.4%, 24.7%, and 8.7% in finfish (Larimichthys crocea and others), sea cucumber (Apostichopus japonicus), abalone (Haliotis spp.), laminaria (Laminaria japonica), gracilaria (Gracilaria spp.), and porphyra (Porphyra spp.) production, respectively. Resource use impacts were dominated by finfish production (over 90% of the total), but recent increases were mostly due to the farming of other products. Our study also identified several demographic (household size), socioeconomic (income per capita), technical (farming density, feed usage, and energy usage), and environmental (distance between farms and total nitrogen concentration) variables that were correlated with resource use efficiency. Simulations based on regression models suggested that changes in these factors could increase fish and seaweed production by at least 3%–18% and 2%–23%, respectively, without increasing resource use levels. Sustainable intensification of local mariculture systems could be achieved by enhancing the access to more efficient technology and financial capital, increasing the willingness of engagement in the sector, facilitating the transaction of sea use rights, reducing the amount of nutrient released in coastal areas, and including the heterogeneous effects of farm distances and water quality in marine spatial planning. Our results highlight the existing opportunities in policymaking for more sustainable food production systems and the management of coastal ecosystems in mariculture-dominated seascapes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aApostichopus japonicus 3aGracilaria 3aHaliotis 3aLarimichthys crocea 3aPorphyra 3aSaccharina japonica 3aabalone 3acapital 3acase studies 3aenergy 3afarms 3afish 3amacroalgae 3amariculture 3atotal nitrogen 3awater quality 3aChina 0aSustainable development goals 0aLand use and land cover change 0aCoupled human and ocean systems 0aSustainable intensification 0aAquaculture 0aMarine farming1 aWu, Jing1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2166-12301 aXu, Chongbin1 aChen, Qian1 aWu, Yu1 aYang, Wu1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1682-33490 tJournal of cleaner production.g2022 Mar. 15, v. 340 p.130743-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2022.1307433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02310naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001700144245013600161300002000297520110400317592002801421650001001449650001301459650001401472650001601486653004601502653002601548653001001574653003101584653001601615700001701631700001601648700001301664700001601677700001601693773012601709856008001835852000901915655001201924IND60528303320221118220402.0160716e20150603xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052830332DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.5b011882doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMing, Shouli10aThiadiazolo[3,4-c]pyridine as an Acceptor toward Fast-Switching Green Donor–Acceptor-Type Electrochromic Polymer with Low Bandgap  ap. 11089-11098.  aThiadiazolo[3,4-c]pyridine (PT), an important analog of benzothiadiazole (BT), has most recently been explored as a novel electron acceptor.

Herein, PT was employed for the rational design of novel donor–acceptor-type systems to yield a neutral green electrochromic polymer poly(4,7-di(2,3-dihydrothieno[3,4-b][1,4]dioxin-5-yl)-[1,2,5] thiadiazolo[3,4-c]pyridine) (PEPTE). PEPTE revealed a lower bandgap (Eg,ₑₗₑ = 0.85 eV, Eg,ₒₚₜ = 1.12 eV) than its BT analog and also favorable redox activity and stability. Furthermore, electrochromic kinetic studies demonstrated that PEPTE displayed higher coloration efficiency than BT analog, good optical memory, and very fast switching time (0.3 s at all three wavelengths), indicating that PT would probably be a promising choice for developing novel neutral green electrochromic polymers by matching with various donor units.  aPublisher supplied data 3acolor 3apolymers 3apyridines 3awavelengths 0adonor−acceptor-type conjugated polymers 0agreen electrochromics 0aPEDOT 0athiadiazolo[3,4-c]pyridine 0alow bandgap1 aZhen, Shijie1 aLin, Kaiwen1 aZhao, Li1 aXu, Jingkun1 aLu, Baoyang0 tACS Applied Materials & Interfaces.g2015 June 03, v. 7, no. 21 p.11089-11098dAmerican Chemical Societyx1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facsami.5b011883Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02535naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002700147245007600174300001600250500001500266520109100281592002801372650001601400650002401416650001301440650001801453650001301471650002801484650002501512650002601537650001401563650001301577650001001590650002001600650002501620650001201645650001301657650001101670653001701681700001701698700001901715700002301734700003601757700002501793773009801818856008101916990002301997852000902020655001202029IND60093157220221120160156.0141103e20120901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009315722DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cej.2012.06.1222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDíaz Reinoso, Beatriz10aOptimization of antioxidants – Extraction from Castanea sativa leaves  ap. 101-109.  a2019-12-06  aThe extraction of Castanea sativa leaves (CsLs) with selected solvents (96% ethanol, methanol and acidified water) was assessed by means of a set of experiments following a Box–Wilson central composite circumscribed (CCC) design. CsL extraction was assessed on the basis of experimental results determined for the yield in soluble compounds, the yield in phenolics and the antioxidant activity of extracts. The in vitro antioxidant activity was measured in terms of the scavenging abilities for α,α-diphenyl-β-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical. Selected extracts were also assayed for scavenging activity against reactive oxygen species (ROSs) and reactive nitrogen species (RNSs). The highest extraction yields were obtained using methanol, whereas water allowed a selective extraction (with yields in phenolics up to 9mg Gallic Acid Equivalent/100mgCsL) and provided the most concentrated (54mg GAE/100mg solid) and active extracts. The major compounds identified in extracts were gallic acid, protocatechuic acid, 4-hydroxybenzoic acid, vanillic acid, rutin, quercetin and apigenin.  aPublisher supplied data 3agallic acid 3aprotocatechuic acid 3amethanol 3avanillic acid 3anitrogen 3areactive oxygen species 3achemical engineering 3a4-hydroxybenzoic acid 3aquercetin 3asolvents 3arutin 3aCastanea sativa 3aantioxidant activity 3aethanol 3aapigenin 3aleaves 0aantioxidants1 aCouto, Diana1 aMoure, Andrés1 aFernandes, Eduarda1 aDomínguez González, Herminia,1 aParajó, Juan Carlos0 tChemical engineering journal.g2012 Sept. 1, v. 203 p.101-109dElsevier B.V.x1385-89477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cej.2012.06.1223Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03096naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001500151245007800166520156700244592002801811650001101839650004301850650002801893650001701921651001001938653002301948653003301971653002002004653001902024653001902043653000802062653000802070653000802078653000802086653000802094653000802102653000902110653001302119653001402132700005302146700001802199700006602217700002602283700001602309700005702325773011302382856008602495852000902581655001202590IND60766427220221117042124.0221004e20220315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076642722DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2022.1307442doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRen, Jiayi10aExploring thermal comfort of urban buildings based on local climate zones  aDespite increasing attention to rising land surface temperatures (LSTs) and other climate changes caused by urbanization, few studies have considered the characteristics of LST or thermal comfort of human settlements from a regional perspective. Therefore, to explore the regional characteristics of LST and thermal comfort in Zhengzhou, China, we calculated the predicted mean vote (PMV) based on local climate zones (LCZs) using ENVI-met and studied correlations between LSTs and vegetation-type LCZs. The total land area under human settlements in Zhengzhou is 316.26 km², 52.72% of which is accounted by LCZs of buildings. The LSTs of built-up areas in this region were significantly higher than those of natural surfaces, with the highest and lowest LSTs of 37.98 °C (in LCZ3; compact low-rise buildings) and 32.46 °C (in LCZG; water areas), respectively. Under the same conditions, the PMV value was considered near “moderate” in areas with sparsely distributed buildings. LCZ7 (sparse high-rise buildings) always exhibited the lowest PMV, with an average value of −0.16 at 18:00 h. In addition, the correlations between LST and normalized difference vegetation index varied for LCZs with different types of vegetation, with the highest correlation coefficient (−0.80) observed in LCZA and the lowest correlation coefficient (−0.62) observed in LCZB. These results provide a reference for designing an optimal layout of urban facilities to regulate the thermal environment of human settlements and promoting urban sustainable development.  aPublisher supplied data 3ahumans 3anormalized difference vegetation index 3asustainable development 3aurbanization 3aChina 0aLocal climate zone 0aRegional thermal environment 0aThermal comfort 0aEnergy balance 0aZhengzhou City 0aLST 0aLCZ 0aPMV 0aNTL 0aUHI 0aGDP 0aNDVI 0aDMSP-OLS 0aNPP-VIIRS1 aYang, Jun1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6740-43581 aZhang, Yuqing1 aXiao, X.q(Xiangming),1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0956-74281 aXia, Jianhong Cecilia1 aLi, Xueming1 aWang, Shaohua1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8651-95050 tJournal of cleaner production.g2022 Mar. 15, v. 340 p.130744-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2022.1307443Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03783naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245009400170300001800264500001400282520198000296536024402276592002802520596001602548596006502564650001502629650002202644650002002666650001602686650001002702650001602712650001602728650001202744650000902756650001302765650001702778650001202795650001002807650000902817653002102826653001602847653002202863653000802885653001202893700002102905700001702926700002202943700002602965700001602991773012803007856008503135852000903220655001203229IND60694502720221118061322.0200513e20190102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069450272DNAL7 a10.1080/1828051X.2019.16212152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTrevisi, Paolo10aDeveloping and testing a new feed block for the gut health and welfare of the weaning pig  ap. 1117-1125.  aNAL-light  aPig weaning cause transient stress and reduction of feed intake and intestinal villi. Providing feed with solid texture could stimulate explorative interest, relieving weaning drawbacks and improving welfare. Feed blocks (0.8 kg each) were produced and 8 formulas were preliminarily tested for consumption on a pig farm (ingredients: wheat by-products, dried milk whey, calcium carbonate, oil, molasses). Feed consumption and growth within 3 days after weaning were assessed on penned litters fed the normal feed ad libitum, and one of the 3 best block formulas or a control (wooden pieces). Block consumption was relevant, but growth and carcase quality on a sub-sample reared to commercial maturation were not changed. These formulations were also tested against control on 72 weaned pigs on which behaviour related to feeding and social activities was evaluated by means of surveys using cameras. After 4 days, pigs were slaughtered and the small intestines were sampled for mucosa morphology. In general, block consumption was additive with the consumption of normal feed. Growth was not affected. One formulation (major ingredients: wheat middlings, cane molasses, milk whey and coconut oil) increased the mucosal surface area of the intestinal villi by 7.9% (p < .05) and the length of time the pigs slept (p < .01), of the activities detected by cameras. The presence of some ingredient in the formula may have influenced feed block consumption with a potential reduction in the negative impact of weaning on the growth of the intestinal villi and an improvement of some behavioural parameters.HighlightsIngredient composition may influence the disappearance of the feed block, as a variable combination of disaggregation and intake by the piglets. The formulation based on wheat middlings, cane molasses, milk whey and coconut oil may improve growth and favour better welfare Block supplementation may increase the absorbent surface of the proximal jejunum.  aThe project was supported by MIPAAF-OIGA project “PIGBLOCK” (Ministry of Agricultural, Food and Forestry Policies).

To elucidate the biosynthetic pathway of bagremycins, two genes named bagB and bagC, were cloned and characterized from a bagremycin-producing strain. The deduced protein products of bagB and bagC show high sequence identity with aldolase and 3-dehydroquinate synthase, respectively. The bagC gene is located immediately downstream of the bagB gene and subsequent reverse transcription and polymerase chain reaction analysis revealed that bagB is co-transcribed with bagC. Inactivation of either bagB or bagC resulted in the complete abolishment of bagremycin production in fermented cultures, which suggests that these two genes are involved in the biosynthesis of bagremycins. The results from this study will allow acquisition of the entire biosynthetic cluster for bagremycins and further our understanding of the biosynthetic pathway and mechanism of action of bagremycin.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGram-positive bacteria 3aStreptomyces 3aantibiotics 3abiochemical pathways 3abiosynthesis 3afructose-bisphosphate aldolase 3afungi 3agenes 3amechanism of action 3aprotein products 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3asequence analysis1 aXu, Dakui1 aLiao, Siyi1 aYe, Jiang1 aZhang, Huizhan0 tAnnals of microbiology.g2013 Mar., v. 63, no. 1 p.167-172dSpringer-Verlagx1590-42617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13213-012-0457-0  aDNAL 7aarticle03672naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094024002200121024001900143040001800162100002500180245013800205300001600343500002000359506007600379520198800455592002802443506003702471650001602508650002202524650002102546650001302567650001302580650001802593650002802611650001502639650002502654650002002679650001102699650001602710650001202726650001402738650001802752650001502770650001502785650001602800650001302816650001302829650002402842650001302866650001202879700002002891773011302911856007303024852000903097655001203106IND60608309120221207090558.0180807e201808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060830912DNAL7 a10.1111/tpj.139842doi7 aPMC60994742pmcid7 a298822672pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDewhirst, Rebecca A.10aOxalyltransferase, a plant cell‐wall acyltransferase activity, transfers oxalate groups from ascorbate metabolites to carbohydrates  ap. 743-757.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aIn the plant apoplast, ascorbate is oxidised, via dehydroascorbic acid, to O‐oxalyl esters [oxalyl‐l‐threonate (OxT) and cyclic oxalyl‐l‐threonate (cOxT)]. We tested whether OxT and cOxT can donate the oxalyl group in transacylation reactions to form oxalyl‐polysaccharides, potentially modifying the cell wall. [oxalyl‐¹⁴C]OxT was incubated with living spinach (Spinacia oleracea) and Arabidopsis cell‐suspension cultures in the presence or absence of proposed acceptor substrates (carbohydrates). In addition, [¹⁴C]OxT and [¹⁴C]cOxT were incubated in vitro with cell‐wall enzyme preparations plus proposed acceptor substrates. Radioactive products were monitored electrophoretically. Oxalyltransferase activity was detected. Living cells incorporated oxalate groups from OxT into cell‐wall polymers via ester bonds. When sugars were added, [¹⁴C]oxalyl‐sugars were formed, in competition with OxT hydrolysis. Preferred acceptor substrates were carbohydrates possessing primary alcohols e.g. glucose. A model transacylation product, [¹⁴C]oxalyl‐glucose, was relatively stable in vivo (half‐life >24 h), whereas [¹⁴C]OxT underwent rapid turnover (half‐life ~6 h). Ionically wall‐bound enzymes catalysed similar transacylation reactions in vitro with OxT or cOxT as oxalyl donor substrates and any of a range of sugars or hemicelluloses as acceptor substrates. Glucosamine was O‐oxalylated, not N‐oxalylated. We conclude that plants possess apoplastic acyltransferase (oxalyltransferase) activity that transfers oxalyl groups from ascorbate catabolites to carbohydrates, forming relatively long‐lived O‐oxalyl‐carbohydrates. The findings increase the range of known metabolites whose accumulation in vivo indicates vitamin C catabolism. Possible signalling roles of the resulting oxalyl‐sugars can now be investigated, as can the potential ability of polysaccharide oxalylation to modify the wall's physical properties.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aArabidopsis 3aSpinacia oleracea 3aacyltransferases 3aalcohols 3aapoplast 3aascorbic acid 3acell suspension culture 3acell walls 3adehydroascorbic acid 3aenzyme activity 3aesters 3aglucosamine 3aglucose 3ahalf life 3ahemicellulose 3ahydrolysis 3ametabolism 3ametabolites 3amoieties 3aoxalates 3aphysical properties 3apolymers 3aspinach1 aFry, Stephen C.0 tplant journal.g2018 Aug., v. 95, no. 4 p.743-757dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl47643x0960-74127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/tpj.139843Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01904naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001900143245007000162300001800232520077100250592002801021650002201049650002401071650001101095650001401106650001201120650001101132650001001143650001301153653001901166653001101185653002201196700002101218700001801239700002201257773015301279856007701432852000901509655001201518IND60522329420221121204753.0160602e20140602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052232942DNAL7 a10.1515/znb-2008-12192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZaremba, Roman10aRare Earth-Transition Metal Indides with Lu5Ni2In4-type Structure  ap. 1447-1449.  aNew intermetallic compounds RE₅T₂In₄ (RE = Sc, Y, La-Nd, Sm, Gd-Tm, Lu; T = Rh, Ir) were synthesized by arc-melting of the elements or by induction melting of the elements in tantalum crucibles under flowing argon.

Overall, 39 dogs were recruited in a kennel, split in 4 groups: G1, 10 puppies of small size breeds; G2, 6 puppies of medium size breed; G3, 11 adult dogs of medium size breeds; G4, 12 adult dogs of toy breeds. The dogs of each group were fed 4 different complete diets, according to the requirements. Hairs were sampled at the beginning of the study (D0) and after 60 days (D60). Elements were analysed in triplicate using ICP-OES. In the hair of the adult dogs of the G3 group the concentration of Al (p < .01) was lower and in the G2 group the concentration of Zn was higher (p < .01) than in the other groups. Cu and Mn concentrations in the hair were higher (p < .01 and p < .05, respectively) in puppies fed G1 and G2 diets in comparison to adult dogs fed G3 and G43 diets. Hair concentrations of K, Li and Na were higher at D60 in comparison with D0 (p < .01). Correlations between concentrations in the hair of Al and Fe, Al and Mg and Fe and Mg were highly significant (p < .01). Present data do not support the use of element concentrations in the hair to assess their nutritional supply but, likely, they can be used in relation to physiological status of the animals. Further studies are required to investigate the factors affecting element concentrations in the hair of dogs.HighlightsConcentrations of Cu, Mn and Zn in the hair differed between growing and adult dogs; Al concentration in hair was highly correlated with Fe and Mg; Several factors other than nutritional supply regulate element deposition in the hair  aPublisher supplied data 3aadults 3akennels 3aphysiological state 0aElements 0adog 0ahair 0adiet1 aMattiello, Alessandro1 aRonutti, Linda1 aSandri, Misa1 aStefanon, Bruno0 tItalian journal of animal science.g2019 Jan. 2, v. 18, no. 1 p.1126-1134dTaylor & FranciswJournal:11638x1828-051X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/1828051X.2019.16216873Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02763naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002200139245011100161300001800272520155400290592002801844650001501872650001601887650001501903650002801918650001701946650001801963650001301981650001801994650002102012650001302033650002502046650000702071650001402078700002002092700001802112700001802130773012102148856007502269852000902344655001202353IND60559229720221119064929.0161201e20140821xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055922972DNAL7 a10.1021/jp506211b2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBharmoria, Pankaj10aStructural and Functional Stability of Cellulase in Aqueous-Biamphiphilic Ionic Liquid Surfactant Solution  ap. 9890-9899.  aIn order to explore the potential of a biamphiphilic ionic liquid surfactant as an enzyme stabilizer in detergents, we have investigated the structural and functional stability of cellulase upon interaction with 3-methyl-1-octylimidazolium dodecylsulfate, [C₈mim][C₁₂OSO₃], in aqueous medium at pH 4.8. Adsorption and binding isotherms determined from tensiometry and isothermal titration calorimetry indicated that [C₈mim][C₁₂OSO₃] interacts with cellulase distinctly at the three critical concentrations, viz., aggregation, C₁, saturation, C₂, and vesicular, C₃. Fluorescence (at λₑₓ = 280 nm), far UV-circular dichroism spectra, and dynamic light scattering results have shown that [C₈mim][C₁₂OSO₃] alters the tertiary and secondary structure of cellulase with a slight initial unfolding in the monomeric regime (up to C₁), refolding in the aggregation regime (up to C₂), and unfolding in the shared aggregation regimes (below C₃) and stabilizes the altered conformation in the post-vesicular regime with an overall variation of hydrodynamic diameter from 4.12 to 7.19 nm. A dinitrosalicylic acid sugar assay test showed excellent functional stability of cellulase with an activity of ≥1 unit/mg in all the concentration regimes. A very good surface activity (J. Phys. Chem. B 2012, 116, 14363) complied by the present results vindicates the candidature of [C₈mim][C₁₂OSO₃] as a potential alternative of mixed micelles or nonionic surfactants for cellulase stabilization in detergent industries.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3acalorimetry 3adetergents 3aendo-1,4-beta-glucanase 3afluorescence 3ahydrodynamics 3aindustry 3aionic liquids 3alight scattering 3amicelles 3anonionic surfactants 3apH 3atitration1 aMehta, Mohit

In this study, we assessed the microencapsulation of the Gram-negative, non-spore-forming plant-beneficial bacterial strain Collimonas arenae Cal35 in novel cross-linked alginate microcapsules (CLAMs) formed by spray-drying, and in novel cross-linked alginate matrix shell (CLAMshell) particles formed by fluidized bed spray-coating. Survival of Cal35 was 10-fold greater in CLAMs than in CLAMshells. During individual stress tests, Cal35 was found to be more tolerant to high temperatures than to desiccation. This is consistent with the greater survival of Cal35 when encapsulated by spray-drying, which is a process that uses high inlet temperature and short exposure times to dry conditions. The particle diameter of CLAMs ranged from 5 to 20 μm, indicating potential for spray applications. CLAMshell particle diameters were between 250 and 300 μm, suggesting potential for seed coatings.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalginates 3abiopesticides 3abiotechnology 3acrosslinking 3afluidized beds 3amicroencapsulation 3aparticle size 3aspray drying 3atemperature 0aSpray-drying 0afluidized bed spray-coating 0abiocontrol 0aCollimonas1 aLeveau, Johan H.

This information additionally provided a data base for the development of an elongation model for an emerging cotton hypocotyl which is not included in this report. Soil temperature increasing from 15.6 to 32.2 C resulted in more rapid and greater total elongation of hypocotyls and radicles. Increasing physical impedance decreased elongation of both hypocotyls and radicles, with hypocotyls being the most sensitive. Decreased hypocotyl elongation was consistently noted with increasing soil moisture tension; however, radicle elongation tended to be greater at 3.0 bars than for .3 bar. A marked temperature-moisture interaction was evident for hypocotyl and radicle elongation at 37.8 C which is near the hot null temperature (40 C) for cotton. However, this interaction did not exist at 15.6 which is near the cold null (14 C). A relative slow-down in hypocotyl elongation rate between 2.5 and 5.0 cm occurred at 37.8 C and .3 bars soil moisture, and at 32.2 C and 3.0 bars.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGossypium hirsutum 3acold 3acotton 3adatabases 3aedaphic factors 3ahypocotyls 3amodels 3aseedling growth 3asoil temperature 3asoil water1 aBuxton, D.

However, vivianite equilibria and kinetics under in situ conditions are not fully understood and the occurrence of vivianite in wetland soils is rarely documented. In the present investigation we have monitored the temporal (November to June) variation in the pore water chemistry of a wet meadow soil (Sapric Medihemist) including a vivianite-containing gyttja layer. Pore water concentrations of Ca, FeII, HCO3, and NH4 in the gyttja layer were higher than in adjacent horizons. In contrast, dissolved Pi concentrations were the lowest observed in the profile and showed only minor fluctuations (between 0.1 and 6μM). Pore water composition in the gyttja layer was close to equilibrium with vivianite (saturation index, SIviv, 2.01±0.53) at constant pH (~6.8). Dissolution and precipitation experiments in the laboratory with soil suspensions from the gyttja layer demonstrated that vivianite solubility equilibria were only slowly restored. Even after 120days following perturbation the supersaturation was still high (SIviv~6). It seems that vivianite does contribute to Pi immobilization in anoxic soil horizons, but due to slow precipitation kinetics such soils cannot maintain Pi concentrations at levels below critical thresholds for eutrophication (~1μM), except if pore water geochemistry is kept stable.  aPublisher supplied data 3acalcium 3aeutrophication 3ageochemistry 3ahydrochemistry 3alaboratory experimentation 3ameadows 3aorthophosphates 3apH 3asoil horizons 3asolubility 3awater quality 3awetland soils 0aWetland 0aGyttja 0aVivianite 0aSorption 0aIron(II) 0aPhosphate1 aKoch, C.

Among the seven synthesized baicalin tetrazoles, one with trifloromethyl group in the aromatic ring was found to be most potent during the initial study. The mechanism of preventive effect of most potent compound 4c against Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia was investigated in detail. The compound 4c decreased the parasitic load by almost 99% in the rats. It significantly (P < 0.05) decreased mortality rate of the rats, prevented pulmonary tissue damage and aggregation of inflammatory cytokines. In Pneumocystis carinii infected rats compound 4c treatment inhibited production of interleukin-18, interleukin-1β and TNF-α significantly (P < 0.05) in the BALF and pulmonary tissues. Treatment of the pneumocystis carinii-infected rats with compound 4c inhibited up-regulation of mRNA expression corresponding NLRP3, ASC and caspase-1. The compound 4c treatment of the pneumocystis carinii-infected rats significantly (P < 0.02) suppressed the level of NLRP3 and ASC proteins. Moreover, the enhancement of caspase-1 activation by pneumocystis carinii-infection in rats was also suppressed by compound 4c. The results from present study demonstrate that compound 4c protects pneumocystis carinii induced pneumonia through suppression of inflammatory cytokines and NLRP3 activation. Therefore, compound 4c can be of therapeutic importance for the treatment of pneumocystis carinii induced pneumonia.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPneumocystis carinii 3aanimal models 3aaromatic compounds 3abaicalin 3acaspase-1 3agene expression 3agene expression regulation 3ainterleukin-18 3ainterleukin-1beta 3amessenger RNA 3amoieties 3amortality 3aparasite load 3apneumonia 3aproteins 3arats 3atherapeutics 3atissues 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha 0aTetrazole 0aAnti-inflammatory 0aImmunodeficiency 0aCytokines1 aZhang, Xin1 aPeng, Xiaying1 aYang, Yang1 aYu, Hua0 tMicrobial pathogenesis.g2019 July, v. 132 p.59-65dElsevier LtdwJournal:11911x0882-40107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.micpath.2019.04.0273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02161naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001800146245007300164300001800237520092100255536020001176592002801376650001101404650001301415650002601428653002001454653001401474653001701488653001401505653002001519653001701539653002201556700001801578773011401596856008001710852000901790655001201799IND60620933620221121013406.0181114e201409  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062093362DNAL7 a10.1177/00027642145270902doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNahon, Karine10aHomophily in the Guise of Cross-LinkingbPolitical Blogs and Content  ap. 1294-1313.  aThis study examines the behavior of influential political blogs (conservative and liberal) in reference to external viral content during March 2007 and June 2009.

Findings show that while homophily patterns prevail, some limited occurrences of cross-ideological practices exist. The cross-linking practices may include deliberative motives, but in essence they are not created for the purposes of discourse. Instead, these cross-linking practices strengthen previously held political stances of the users who create them and negatively portray and reframe content of alternative views. This represents homophily in the guise of cross-linking.  aFunding The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This paper was supported by the Google Research Award.  aPublisher supplied data 3amodels 3apolitics 3aquantitative analysis 0apolitical blogs 0ahomophily 0aviral videos 0ainfluence 0asocial networks 0asocial media 0ainformation flows1 aHemsley, Jeff0 tAmerican behavioral scientist.g, v. 58, no. 10 p.1294-1313dSAGE PublicationswJournal:2328x1552-33817nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/00027642145270903Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03518naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003500135040001800170100001900188245010900207300001100316506007600327520116600403592002801569596008901597596011001686596009201796596009201888596006601980596015702046506003702203650003402240650002502274650001802299650002502317650001702342650001702359650005302376650001102429650001902440650002002459650001002479650001602489650001502505650000902520650001602529650001102545650001802556700001402574700001502588700001902603700001702622700005702639773012902696856008202825852000902907655001202916IND60637791820221207065803.0201028e201912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063779182DNAL7 a310142892pmid7 aPMC64777192pmcid7 a10.1186/s12906-019-2498-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhou, Jin-Yong14aThe modified Si-Jun-Zi Decoction attenuates colon cancer liver metastasis by increasing macrophage cells  ap. 86.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: The modified Si-Jun-Zi Decoction (SJZ), a Chinese medicine formula, is clinically used against multiple malignancies including colorectal cancer (CRC). This study aims to evaluate the effect of modified SJZ on CRC liver metastasis and identify the therapeutic mechanisms. METHODS: Human CRC cells with GFP fluorescence were transplanted into Balb/c nude mice spleens. Modified SJZ, 5-fluorouracil or the combined treatment was given for 3 weeks. CRC liver metastasis was measured by fluorescence imaging and plasma cytokines were analyzed. Furthermore, the effects of administration time and doses for the modified SJZ were investigated in nude mice. RESULTS: Modified SJZ could increase the survival rate and reduce CRC liver metastasis in the nude mice model. Plasma GM-CSF level was elevated. Three weeks of treatment with the modified SJZ at the full dose (45 g/kg) could significantly increase the number of macrophages but not neutrophils in the spleen. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that modified SJZ can inhibit CRC liver metastasis by activating the innate immune system, providing a complementary and alternative therapy for CRC.  aPublisher supplied data  aPAPDcPriority Academic Program Development of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions  aBL2014100cClinical Medical Research Center of Digestive Diseases on Chinese Medicine of Jiangsu Province  ak2014yrc20cpeak academic talents plan in Jiangsu Province Hospital of Chinese Medicine  ak2018yrc25cpeak academic talents plan in Jiangsu Province Hospital of Chinese Medicine  aLGY2018062cSix Talent Peaks Project in Jiangsu Province (CN)  aNational famous Chinese Medicine Doctor Studio NO. 2018-119cState Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine of the People's Republic of China (CN)0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aOriental traditional medicine 3aalternative medicine 3aanimal models 3acolorectal neoplasms 3afluorescence 3afluorouracil 3agranulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor 3ahumans 3aimage analysis 3ainnate immunity 3aliver 3amacrophages 3ametastasis 3amice 3aneutrophils 3aspleen 3asurvival rate1 aChen, Min1 aWu, Cun-En1 aZhuang, Yu-Wen1 aChen, Yu-Gen1 aLiu, Shen-Lin1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9959-37040 tBMC complementary and alternative medicine.g2019 Dec., v. 19, no. 1 p.86-86dBioMed CentralwJournal:21388x1472-68827nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12906-019-2498-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02951naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001800145245009100163300001600254500001500270520185300285592002802138650001902166650001102185650001102196650001302207650002402220650001102244650001402255650001302269651001002282653001502292700001802307700001802325700001802343700002202361773011302383856004802496852000902544655001202553IND4472348420221122173516.0120727e201112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447234842DNAL7 a10.1007/s00704-011-0436-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Xiaodong12aA modeling study of the effects of aerosols on clouds and precipitation over East Asia  ap. 343-354.  a2019-12-06  aThe National Center for Atmospheric Research Community Atmosphere Model (version 3.5) coupled with the Morrison–Gettelman two-moment cloud microphysics scheme is employed to simulate the aerosol effects on clouds and precipitation in two numerical experiments, one representing present-day conditions (year 2000) and the other the pre-industrial conditions (year 1750) over East Asia by considering both direct and indirect aerosol effects. To isolate the aerosol effects, we used the same set of boundary conditions and only altered the aerosol emissions in both experiments. The simulated results show that the cloud microphysical properties are markedly affected by the increase in aerosols, especially for the column cloud droplet number concentration (DNC), liquid water path (LWP), and the cloud droplet effective radius (DER). With increased aerosols, DNC and LWP have been increased by 137% and 28%, respectively, while DER is reduced by 20%. Precipitation rates in East Asia and East China are reduced by 5.8% and 13%, respectively, by both the aerosol’s second indirect effect and the radiative forcing that enhanced atmospheric stability associated with the aerosol direct and first indirect effects. The significant reduction in summer precipitation in East Asia is also consistent with the weakening of the East Asian summer monsoon, resulting from the decreasing thermodynamic contrast between the Asian landmass and the surrounding oceans induced by the aerosol’s radiative effects. The increase in aerosols reduces the surface net shortwave radiative flux over the East Asia landmass, which leads to the reduction of the land surface temperature. With minimal changes in the sea surface temperature, hence, the weakening of the East Asian summer monsoon further enhances the reduction of summer precipitation over East Asia.  aPublisher supplied data 3amonsoon season 3aoceans 3amodels 3aaerosols 3asurface temperature 3asummer 3aemissions 3adroplets 3aChina 0aatmosphere1 aXie, Xiaoning1 aYin, Zhi-Yong1 aLiu, Changhai1 aGettelman, Andrew0 tTheoretical and applied climatology.g2011 Dec., v. 106, no. 3-4 p.343-354dSpringer-Verlagx0177-798X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00704-011-0436-6  aDNAL 7aarticle02834naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002200153245012600175300001400301520131400315592002801629650001501657650001701672650001401689650001501703650002901718650002601747650001801773650001501791650001701806650001101823650000701834650002401841650002301865650002301888650001301911650001601924653003201940653001101972653001801983653003802001653002302039700002302062700002202085700002502107773009902132856008802231852000902319655001202328IND60637457320221118034841.0190529e201906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063745732DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apgeochem.2019.04.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTomczak, Wirginia10aKd distributions in freshwater systems as a function of material type, mass-volume ratio, dissolved organic carbon and pH  ap. 68-77.  aThe contamination of freshwater systems by metals is a worldwide problem due to their toxicity, abundance and persistence in the environment. One of the main processes affecting their residence time in freshwater systems is their solid-liquid fractionation, often modeled by the Kd approach defined as the concentration ratio between the particulate and dissolved phases under the assumptions of reversibility, equilibrium and trace conditions. Because Kd is an empirical parameter that depends on several environmental factors, its variability can cover orders of magnitude for a single element. Such variability is unknown for most case studies, but the modelers need it to evaluate the uncertainty of their calculations. In order to fill this gap, this paper presents statistical Kd distributions for in situ suspended matters as a function of suspended load, dissolved organic carbon and pH. They were obtained using a database containing 8564 Kd values from 50 elements, classified as a function of three exchange conditions (adsorption, desorption and in situ) and two environmental components (suspended and deposited sediments). These distributions and relations can be used to reduce of several order of magnitudes the global variability of Kd values in the case where in situ data are not available.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3acase studies 3adatabases 3adesorption 3adissolved organic carbon 3aenvironmental factors 3afractionation 3afreshwater 3ageochemistry 3ametals 3apH 3asediment deposition 3astatistical models 3asuspended sediment 3atoxicity 3auncertainty 0aLog-normal kd distributions 0aMetals 0aRadionuclides 0aSuspended and deposited sediments 0aFreshwater systems1 aBoyer, J.

We considered a column with a diameter of 2-cm and varying bed depths, including 10cm, 15cm, and 20cm. The breakthrough (C/Cₒ=0.016) times were 31.0h, 49.0h, and 63.0h, and the exhaust (C/Cₒ=0.90) times were 60.0h, 90.0h, and 110.0h, with an up-flow rate of 8mL/min, respectively. The volume of the contaminated water treated at the breakthrough points was 14.88L, 23.52L, and 30.24L, and at the exhaust points 28.80L, 43.20L, and 52.80L, respectively when As(III) concentration was 0.6mg/L. The columns were designed using the logit method to evaluate the adsorption rate (K) and column efficiency (N). The 10-cm exhaust bed was regenerated with 4% NaOH, and its performance was evaluated. This study proposes an in situ two-step mechanism, oxidation of As(III) to As(V), and subsequent adsorption on IOCNR. A column (10cm) performance of real arsenic-bearing groundwater was evaluated. Results indicate that the treated effluent water quality is suitable for domestic use. Moreover, the experimental results agreed well with the geochemical modeling using computer program PHREEQC.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3aaquatic environment 3achemical engineering 3acomputer software 3agroundwater 3amodels 3aoxidation 3awater pollution 3awater quality1 aKao, Yu-Hsuan1 aWang, Jinren,1 aLu, Guang-Sin1 aWu, Jia-Jing1 aLiu, Chen-Wuing0 tChemical engineering journal.g2012 Sept. 1, v. 203 p.285-293dElsevier B.V.x1385-89477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cej.2012.07.0333Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02001naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002000146245010300166300001800269520078300287536012001070592002801190650001401218650001501232650001301247650001501260653002301275653002101298653001201319653001701331653002101348700001701369700002001386700001801406773011401424856008001538852000901618655001201627IND60620933720221120233105.0181114e201409  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062093372DNAL7 a10.1177/00027642145270912doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Weiai Wayne10aPredicting Opinion Leaders in Twitter Activism NetworksbThe Case of the Wisconsin Recall Election  ap. 1278-1293.  aThis study employs content and network analysis techniques to explore the predictors of opinion leadership in a political activism network on Twitter.

A chronosequence of abandoned vineyards was studied on a volcanic island (Pantelleria, Italy). Vegetation in the abandoned fields was initially dominated by annual and perennial herbs, then by Hyparrhenia hirta (L.) Stapf, and finally by woody communities. As a consequence, the dominant photosynthetic pathway changed from C3 to C4 and then back to C3. Conversion of a plant community dominated by one photosynthetic pathway to another changes the 13C/12C ratio of inputs to SOC. Using the time since abandonment and the shift in belowground δ13C of SOC relative to the aboveground δ13C plant community, we estimated C3-C and C4-C changes during secondary succession.SOC content (gkg−1) increased linearly (R2=0.89 and 0.73 for 0–15 and 15–30cm soil depth) with the age of abandonment, increasing from 12gkg−1 in cultivated vineyards to as high as 26gkg−1 in the last stage of the succession. δ13C increased in the bulk soil and its three aggregate fractions (>250, 250–25, and <25μm) during succession, but the effect of soil depth and its interaction with succession age were significant only for soil aggregate fractions. Polynomial curves described the change in δ13C over the chronosequence for both depths. δ13C in the bulk soil had increased from −28‰ to −24‰ by 35years after abandonment for both depths but then decreased to −26‰ at 60years after abandonment (corresponding with maturity of the woody plant community). Overall, the results indicate that abandoned vineyards on volcanic soil in a semi-arid environment are C sinks and that C storage in these soils is closely related to plant succession.  aPublisher supplied data 3achronosequences 3aherbs 3aHyparrhenia hirta 3avineyards 3asoil organic carbon 3avolcanic soils 3aplant communities 3asemiarid zones 3asoil depth 3acarbon sinks 3acarbon sequestration 3awoody plants 3avegetation 3aMediterranean climate 3asecondary succession 3aItaly 0aSoil carbon turnover 0aStable carbon isotopes 0acarbon 0aMediterranean succession 0aC3–C4 and C4–C3 vegetation change1 aGristina, Luciano1 aLa Mantia, Tommaso1 aRühl, Juliane0 tGeoderma.g2013 Feb., v. 193-194 p.213-221dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl16374x0016-70617nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.geoderma.2012.08.0363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02585naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245005900164300001600223520142100239592002801660650002201688650001101710650002501721650001101746650001401757650001801771650001601789650001301805650001401818650000701832650001601839650001201855650001601867700001601883700001501899700001101914700001501925773009801940856008102038990002302119852000902142655001202151IND60093157920221120160025.0141103e20120901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009315792DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cej.2012.07.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTan, Chaoqun10aHeat-activated persulfate oxidation of diuron in water  ap. 294-300.  aHeat-activated persulfate oxidation of diuron, a commonly found herbicide in groundwater, was evaluated in this study. Sulfate radicals SO₄ ⁻ was the principal oxidizing agent responsible for the diuron degradation. The diuron decomposition exhibited a pseudo-first-order kinetics pattern at all the conditions tested. The observed rate constants determined at 50–70°C well fit the Arrhenius equation, yielding an activation energy of 166.7±0.8kJmol⁻¹. Temperature, persulfate dose, initial diuron concentration, pH, and three common groundwater solutes (CO₃ ²⁻,HCO₃ ⁻, and Cl⁻), to different degrees, influenced the degradation. Typically, high temperature, high persulfate dose, and low initial diuron concentration increased the decomposition rate of diuron. At the tested pH range of 5.5–8.1, the highest degradation rate (kₒbₛ=0.18min⁻¹) occurred at pH 6.3. The three groundwater anions inhibited the diuron decomposition with the following order: CO₃ ²⁻>HCO₃ ⁻>Cl⁻. The major oxidation products in this study were C₁₅H₁₅ON₃Cl₄ (P₃, m/z=376.2), C₁₆H₁₆O₄N₃Cl₄ (P₄, m/z=420.3), and C₁₇H₁₇O₇N₃Cl₄ (P₅, m/z=465.4), different from those produced during hydroxyl radical-induced advanced oxidation. The in situ chemical oxidation (ISCO) technology can be achieved in practice through combination with in situ thermal remediation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactivation energy 3aanions 3achemical engineering 3adiuron 3aequations 3afree radicals 3agroundwater 3aoxidants 3aoxidation 3apH 3aremediation 3asolutes 3atemperature1 aGao, Naiyun1 aDeng, Yang1 aAn, Na1 aDeng, Jing0 tChemical engineering journal.g2012 Sept. 1, v. 203 p.294-300dElsevier B.V.x1385-89477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cej.2012.07.0053Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02540naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245015400167300001600321520133800337592002801675650002201703650001301725650001101738650001501749650002401764650002101788650001701809650001101826650001101837650001801848650001601866651001201882700001801894700002001912773013201932856008102064852000902145655001202154IND60743513720221118025012.0210707e202104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074351372DNAL7 a10.1134/S20751117210200902doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShevchyk, T.

Currently, this species has naturalized over large areas and has become the background on the coastal waters of the Dnieper reservoirs of hydropower stations. It is necessary to clarify the reasons for the distribution of A. fruticosa populations in different parts of the Middle Dnieper coast under conditions of artificial regulation of its water yield. It has been proven that the high buoyancy of A. fruticosa fruits provides the possibility of its active dispersal along river beds in a natural way under conditions of fluctuations in the level of surface water yield at the time of spring floods. The main and determining factor in the active dissemination of the species on the coast of the Kanev and Kremenchug reservoirs is the frequent variability of the maximum water surface level. The narrow altitudinal span of distribution of this species on the coast in the lower parts and, accordingly, wider span in the upper parts of the reservoirs are determined by the corresponding indicators of water level differences. The possibility of artificial regulation of the water surface level with knowledge of the characteristics of hydrochory of this invasive species makes it possible to influence its distribution in the territory near the reservoirs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAmorpha fruticosa 3aaltitude 3acoasts 3ahydrochory 3ahydroelectric power 3ainvasive species 3apower plants 3arivers 3aspring 3asurface water 3awater yield 3aUkraine1 aDvirna, T.

To investigate the genetic basis of changes in plant and inflorescence traits, we developed a teosinte–maize intermated population. More than 200 common quantitative trait loci (QTLs) and 44 QTL clusters were identified underlying 13 vegetative and reproductive traits. Among them, few common QTLs with major effects were observed, which supported previous hypotheses that a small number of major loci can explain a large portion of phenotypic changes during domestication. Additionally, we found many moderate or minor QTLs that might have critical roles in shaping plant architecture and enhancing grain yield of modern maize. Although maize has better performance for the traits studied here, teosinte still harbored desirable alleles in some of the common QTLs. Furthermore, we integrated multiple datasets and predicted candidate genes underlying these QTLs. This study elucidates the genetic basis of these vegetative and reproductive traits in maize and teosinte, and suggests the possibility of improving maize by teosinte re-domestication using a small number of loci.  aPublisher supplied data  a2016YFD0100303cNational Key Research and Development Plan of China  a2015BAD02B01cNational Science and Technology Planning Project (CN)  a31701431cNational Natural Science Foundation of China 3aZea mays 3aancestry 3acorn 3adata collection 3adomestication 3agermplasm 3agrain yield 3aphenotype 3aplant architecture 3aquantitative traits1 aHuang, Juan1 aHe, Lili1 aLiu, Nian1 aDu, Yanfang1 aHou, Rui1 aDu, Hewei1 aQiu, Fazhan1 aZhang, Zuxin1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8697-16810 tMolecular breeding.g2019 Nov., v. 39, no. 10-11 p.157-157dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl53942x1380-37437nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11032-019-1061-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02889naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245008100170300001600251520177900267592002802046650001102074650001002085650001302095650001302108650001802121650001402139650001402153650001702167650001002184650002202194651001402216651001202230651001102242651001802253651004002271773009002311856008102401852000902482655001202491IND60438385420221121222127.0151023e200802  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6043838542DNAL7 a10.1007/s00227-007-0845-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRawlinson, Kate A.10aBiodiversity of coastal polyclad flatworm assemblages in the wider Caribbean  ap. 769-778.  aPolyclads are mobile predators and possibly an important functional component of hard substrate marine environments globally. To understand the natural patterns of spatial differences, polyclad assemblages were sampled in seven coastal regions across the wider Caribbean spanning 15° latitude and 24° longitude between May and June 2005 and May and September 2006. In total, 67 species in 28 genera and 17 families were recorded from 62 sites. Only two species were found in all surveyed regions, Melloplana ferruginea and Pseudoceros bicolor. Conversely, 41 species were restricted to one or two sites, and 34 species were represented by one or two individuals. The distribution and abundance of species varied between the two suborders. Cotyleans were most species rich and had a higher number of species of restricted range, while Acotylea showed a higher proportion of rare species; however, two species were highly abundant comprising over half of the individuals counted. In most habitats, polyclads were rare, but in some intertidal habitats two species, Styloplanocera fasciata and Boninia divae were densely aggregated and dominant members of the benthic epifauna. Alpha diversity was variable but showed no evidence of a relationship with latitude, longitude or depth. Beta diversity increased with the number of habitats sampled and was highest for cotyleans. Highest gamma diversity was recorded in Jamaica and the US Virgin Islands and was not significantly correlated to alpha diversity. Overall assemblages from the seven regions were similar, revealing faunal homogeneity across the wider region. Reef assemblages were distinct from other habitats dominated by species of the Cotylea. Reefs from Panama and the US Virgin Islands were the most species rich.  aPublisher supplied data 3acoasts 3afauna 3ahabitats 3alatitude 3alittoral zone 3alongitude 3apredators 3arare species 3areefs 3aspecies diversity 3aCaribbean 3aJamaica 3aPanama 3aUnited States 3aVirgin Islands of the United States0 tMarine biology.g2008 Feb., v. 153, no. 5 p.769-778dSpringer-Verlagx0025-31627nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00227-007-0845-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03208naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002100094024002700115024001100142040001800153100001900171245012500190506017300315520131700488650004401805650001001849650002201859650002101881650001401902650003801916650003301954650001101987650001901998650001702017650001302034650000902047650001102056650003302067650002002100650002102120650002202141650002102163700001202184700001402196700002102210700001702231700001902248773010302267856011202370856007302482956009302555961000902648852000902657655001202666IND60006240820221118154641.0160503e201412  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6000624082DNAL7 a10113/624082hdl7 a10.1002/adv.214482doi8 ans9988  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Chunmei10aThermal and Mechanical Properties of Natural Rubber Composites Reinforced with Cellulose Nanocrystals from Southern Pine  aWorks produced by employees of the U.S. Government as part of their official duties are not copyrighted within the U.S. The content of this document is not copyrighted.  aThere is currently a considerable interest in developing bio-based and green nanocomposites in industrial and technological areas owing to their biodegradability, and environmental friendliness. In this study, a bio-based nanosized material, cellulose nanocrystals (CNC), extracted from southern pine pulp was employed as a reinforcing agent in a natural rubber (NR) matrix. NR/CNC nanocomposites were prepared by a solution mixing and casting method. The morphology, thermal, and mechanical properties of the nanocomposites were investigated using scanning electron microscopy, Fourier transform-infrared spectroscopy, tensile tests, dynamic mechanical analysis, thermal gravimetric analysis, and differential scanning calorimetry. The CNC displayed a gradient dispersion in the nanocomposites, and no microscaled aggregates were observed. Both the tensile strength and modulus of the nanocomposites increased with the addition of CNC, accompanied by a slight decrease in elongation at break. The storage modulus also improved with the addition of CNC, which serves as good evidence of the reinforcing tendency of CNC in the NR matrix. The thermal stability of the nanocomposites showed an insignificant decrease in CNC addition. The glass transition temperature of the nanocomposites was not influenced by CNC. 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aPinus 3abiobased products 3abiodegradability 3acellulose 3adifferential scanning calorimetry 3aglass transition temperature 3amixing 3ananocomposites 3ananocrystals 3apolymers 3apulp 3arubber 3ascanning electron microscopy 3astorage modulus 3atensile strength 3athermal stability 3athermogravimetry1 aDan, Yi1 aPeng, Jun1 aTurng, Lih-Sheng1 aSabo, Ronald1 aClemons, Craig0 tAdvances in polymer technology.g2014 Dec., v. 33, no.

Due to its synoptic perspective, remote sensing is an attractive instrument to rapidly assess and diagnose degradation prevalence and status. While it is relatively straight-forward to assess degradation leading to a change in vegetation cover by remote sensing, it is more challenging to study changes in vegetation composition, i.e. vegetation degradation. Therefore, our aim was to investigate the use of the seasonal variation (phenophases) of zonal-specific pastures varying in vegetation degradation using the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). For ground-truthing, quantitative and qualitative relevé data were collected during field surveys 2008–2015 during the growing season, and have been used to validate the classification of vegetation degradation based on eMODIS NDVI composite data for selected normal and dry years. Using a 500 m buffer zone, vegetation features have been extracted and correlated with satellite reflectance spectra for classifying the remote sensing imagery. We found a significant difference in compositional structure among degradation classes for all ecozones. Since qualitative changes in vegetation cover were caused by a replacement of dominant grasses and forbs with unpalatable forbs or shrubs with different reflectance patterns, our results indicate that excluding the alpine zone, vegetation degraded pastures differed from non-degraded ones by higher NDVI values at each phenology phase, although this was not always significant. As vegetation degradation led to an earlier greenup and later senescence, i.e. an observed extension of the growing season in terms of NDVI data, shifts in species composition could also be driving effects that have so far mostly been interpreted as signs of climatic changes. The procedures of this study and the developed conditional inference classification trees enable cost-effective screenings of large areas to detect vegetation degraded pastures and to assess seasonal grazing impact from remote sensing based interpretation. We conclude that the procedures developed here using eMODIS NDVI composite datasets are well suited for vegetation degradation assessments. This can improve monitoring of vegetation degradation as well as land-use planning.  aPublisher supplied data 3abotanical composition 3aclimate change 3acost effectiveness 3adata collection 3aecological zones 3aforbs 3agrasses 3agrazing 3agrowing season 3aland use 3alivelihood 3amonitoring 3amountains 3anormalized difference vegetation index 3apastures 3aphenology 3aplanning 3areflectance 3areflectance spectroscopy 3aremote sensing 3asatellites 3aseasonal variation 3ashrubs 3asurveys 3avegetation cover 3aKyrgyzstan 0aSeasonal pastures 0aVegetation degradation 0aIndicator species of degradation 0aConditional inference framework 0aeMODIS 0aNDVI 0aKyrgyzstan1 aMönnig, Carsten1 aHergarten, Christian1 aDarr, Dietrich1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7235-02751 aWrage-Mönnig, Nicole0 tEcological indicators.g2018 Dec., v. 95 p.527-543dElsevier LtdwJournal:6196x1470-160X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2018.07.0603Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02580naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001400146245012200160300002000282520132000302592002801622650004401650650002701694650001701721650001301738650001501751650001501766650001801781650001901799650001601818700001701834700001701851700002001868700005601888773017301944856008002117852000902197655001202206IND60746457020221120124009.0210805e20210722xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074645702DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.iecr.1c014462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Bowen10aConcise and Efficient Self-Healing Cross-Linked Polyurethanes via the Blocking/Deblocking Reaction of Oxime Urethanes  ap. 11095-11105.  aThe development of self-healing polymers can extend the service life of polymer materials. However, it is still a challenge to prepare a polyurethane with high healing efficiency and maximum retention of the properties of polyurethane itself. In this research, we proposed a new scheme for the industrial production of self-healing polyurethane and successfully synthesized a self-healing polyurethane using diacetyl oxime as the chain extender and triethanolamine as the cross-linking agent. Oxime-blocked isocyanates deblock at a higher temperature and regenerate oxime urethanes at a lower temperature, thereby achieving thermal reversibility and self-healing due to the concise and efficient thermal reversible reaction of oxime urethanes. Fourier transform infrared and differential scanning calorimetry experiments confirmed that the oxime urethanes in the polyurethane deblock efficiently at around 90 °C and re-block after the temperature is lowered. The process can be cycled at least three times. Microscopic observation confirmed that the cracks disappeared within 60–90 min at 90 °C. The tensile test shows that the synthetic DiO-c-PU has a self-healing efficiency of over 94% at 90 °C for 1.5 h, which is more efficient. From the results, it appears that DiO-c-PU has good self-healing properties.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3across-linking reagents 3acrosslinking 3adiacetyl 3adurability 3amicroscopy 3apolyurethanes 3aprocess design 3atemperature1 aHan, Feilong1 aPei, Xuqiang1 aZhang, Suojiang1 aZhao, Jingbo1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7374-45190 tIndustrial & engineering chemistry process design and development.g2021 July 22, v. 60, no. 30 p.11095-11105dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23342x1520-50457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.iecr.1c014463Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02429naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245009400167300001400261500001900275520114800294592002801442650001501470650001401485650000901499650002301508650001401531650001901545650002501564650001701589650001801606653000801624653002201632700002001654700002001674700001601694700002201710700001601732700001501748700001901763773010901782856008301891852000901974655001201983IND60696603820221117013419.0200607e202005  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069660382DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcpa.2020.04.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSoares, L.M.C.10aHistopathological and Immunohistochemical Characteristics of Thyroid Carcinoma in the Dog  ap. 34-41.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThyroid carcinomas are a common form of endocrine neoplasia in dogs. In the present study, we combined histopathology with immunohistochemistry (IHC) to search for the presence of oestrogen receptor alpha (ORα), Cox-2 and Ki67 in canine thyroid carcinomas. Forty-eight thyroid carcinomas were diagnosed throughout the study period. Thyroglobulin and calcitonin IHC distinguished between thyroid tumours with a follicular and medullary (C-cell) origin, respectively. IHC-based diagnosis showed that 42 (87.50%) of the cases were follicular cell carcinoma. In these cases, the follicular–compact pattern was the most frequent (n = 20/42; 47.62%) and six cases (12.5%) were medullary cell (C-cell) carcinomas. Both medullary (C-cell) and follicular carcinomas expressed Ki67 and Cox-2. No differences were observed between medullary and follicular carcinomas with respect to expression of Ki67 (P = 0.34) and Cox-2 (P = 0.9523) markers. A total of 4.17% (n = 2/48) of thyroid carcinomas showed positive nuclear labelling for ORα, suggesting that oestrogen does not directly participate in the pathogenesis of canine thyroid neoplasia.  aPublisher supplied data 3acalcitonin 3acarcinoma 3adogs 3aestrogen receptors 3aestrogens 3ahistopathology 3aimmunohistochemistry 3apathogenesis 3athyroglobulin 0adog 0athyroid carcinoma1 aPereira, A.H.B.1 ade Campos, C.G.1 aRocha, L.S.1 ados Santos, T.Á.1 aSouza, M.A.1 aJark, P.C.1 aPescador, C.A.0 tJournal of comparative pathology.g2020 May, v. 177 p.34-41dElsevier LtdwJournal:1946x0021-99757nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcpa.2020.04.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02370naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100006400152245009100216300001400307520110300321592002801424650000801452650001701460650001501477650001801492650001601510650002201526650001001548650002201558653002201580653001701602653002201619653002601641653001801667653002301685653001101708700001801719700001901737773009601756856008701852852000901939655001201948IND60597261220221119202111.0190628e201808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059726122DNAL7 a10.1016/j.plantsci.2018.02.0242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVazquez-Vilar, Marta1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7175-781810aDNA assembly standards: Setting the low-level programming code for plant biotechnology  ap. 33-41.  aSynthetic Biology is defined as the application of engineering principles to biology. It aims to increase the speed, ease and predictability with which desirable changes and novel traits can be conferred to living cells. The initial steps in this process aim to simplify the encoding of new instructions in DNA by establishing low-level programming languages for biology. Together with advances in the laboratory that allow multiple DNA molecules to be efficiently assembled together into a desired order in a single step, this approach has simplified the design and assembly of multigene constructs and has even facilitated the automated construction of synthetic chromosomes. These advances and technologies are now being applied to plants, for which there are a growing number of software and wetware tools for the design, construction and delivery of DNA molecules and for the engineering of endogenous genes. Here we review the efforts of the past decade that have established synthetic biology workflows and tools for plants and discuss the constraints and bottlenecks of this emerging field.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aDNA assembly 3aautomation 3abiotechnology 3achromosomes 3acomputer software 3agenes 3asynthetic biology 0aSynthetic biology 0aDNA assembly 0aMolecular cloning 0aLaboratory automation 0aBiotechnology 0aGenome engineering 0aCRISPR1 aOrzaez, Diego1 aPatron, Nicola0 tPlant science.g2018 Aug., v. 273 p.33-41dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl38764x0168-94527nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.plantsci.2018.02.0243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03066naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100003000147245009100177300001600268520101500284592002801299650000801327650002101335650001501356650001001371650001301381650001201394650001101406650001401417650001301431650001101444650001201455650002401467650004401491653001301535653002201548653002601570653001201596653001601608653003601624653003401660653004701694653005001741653003701791653003601828653005001864653005101914653003701965653003502002653005002037653004402087700002302131700003002154700002002184700002502204773012102229856008102350852000902431655001202440IND60556531920221118053758.0190318e201701  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055653192DNAL7 a10.1016/j.lwt.2016.09.0312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMuliterno, Marina Martins10aConversion/degradation of isoflavones and color alterations during the drying of okara  ap. 512-519.  aThe aim of this work was to investigate the convective drying of okara, a by-product from soymilk processing. The specific objectives were as follows: to model the drying kinetics using the Fick and Page models; and to evaluate the color and isoflavone content during drying. An oven-dryer with hot air circulation at 50, 60 and 70 °C was used. Samples were taken at each predetermined time to analyze the isoflavone profile by UHPLC and the color. The Page model fitted the drying kinetics data well. Throughout drying, there was a decrease in the color parameters (lightness and hue angle), showing sample browning. A significant reduction in the isoflavone content was observed at 70 °C, possibly due to thermal degradation. During the initial stage of drying at 50 °C, daidzin and genistin were converted to the aglycones daidzein and genistein, respectively, probably due to residual β-glucosidase activity. However, isoflavone degradation was observed during the final stages of drying at 50 °C.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3abeta-glucosidase 3abyproducts 3acolor 3adaidzein 3adaidzin 3adrying 3agenistein 3agenistin 3amodels 3asoymilk 3athermal degradation 3aultra-performance liquid chromatography 0aSoy pulp 0aConvective drying 0aDrying kinetics model 0aQuality 0aIsoflavones 0aDaidzein (PubChem CID: 5281708) 0aDaidzin (PubChem CID: 107971) 0a6″-O-Acetyldaidzin (PubChem CID: 156155) 0a6″-O-Malonyldaidzin (PubChem CID: 53442202) 0aGenistein (PubChem CID: 5280961) 0aGenistin (PubChem CID: 5281377) 0a6″-O-Acetylgenistin (PubChem CID: 22288010) 0a6″-O-Malonylgenistin (PubChem CID: 15934091) 0aGlycitein (PubChem CID: 5317750) 0aGlycitin (PubChem CID: 187808) 0a6″-O-Acetylglycitin (PubChem CID: 53398650) 0aMalonylglycitin (PubChem CID: 23724657)1 aRodrigues, Daniele1 ade Lima, Fernando Sanches1 aIda, Elza Iouko1 aKurozawa, Louise Emy0 tLebensmittel-Wissenschaft + Technologie.g2017 Jan., v. 75 p.512-519dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl1644x0023-64387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lwt.2016.09.0313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02879naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100001700138245012900155520160100284592002801885650001301913650001001926650002001936650002901956650001201985650002101997650000902018650001502027650000902042650001902051650000702070650001402077650001502091650003302106650001802139650001802157651001002175700001302185700001702198700001902215773011802234856007202352852000902424655001202433IND60653229620221123014913.0190714e20170711xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065322962DNAL7 a10.3390/w90705052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCao, Yan-Min10aSpatial Variations in the Surface Water Chemistry of Subtropical Peatlands (Central China) Linked to Anthropogenic Pressures  aCompared with the extensively surveyed temperate and boreal peatlands, subtropical peatlands have received rather little scientific attention. In this study, spatial variations in water chemistry were investigated in 57 samples collected from three subtropical peatlands (central China). Generally, water pH and major cation concentrations of these samples approached the characteristics of poor fens along the bog–rich fen gradient. Four distinct groups were identified by cluster analysis and principal component analysis. High concentrations of trace elements in Group I were probably linked to airborne dust pollutants from a nearby road under construction. Low pH values and low major cation concentrations in Group II may be attributed to the great cation exchange capacity of Sphagnum. In contrast, samples in Group III, mainly collected from sites suffering from Sphagnum harvest, showed high pH levels and major cation concentrations. Relatively low concentrations of trace elements (except boron) in Group IV can be regarded as reference conditions for restoration efforts in these peatlands. Taken together, spatial variations in the water chemistry of the three peatlands were closely linked to natural processes (e.g., cation exchange of Sphagnum) and anthropogenic pressures (e.g., Sphagnum harvest). Overall, the mean health risk values of the six trace elements were low, indicating good water quality in these peatlands. This study provided baseline water chemistry information for the sustainable management of these subtropical peatlands, as well as other similar ecosystems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSphagnum 3aboron 3acation exchange 3acation exchange capacity 3acations 3acluster analysis 3adust 3aecosystems 3afens 3ahydrochemistry 3apH 3apeatlands 3apollutants 3aprincipal component analysis 3asurface water 3awater quality 3aChina1 aChen, Xu1 aBu, Zhao-Jun1 aZeng, Ling-Han0 tWater.g2017 July 11, v. 9, no. 7dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21688x2073-44417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w90705053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02024naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245013700163300001600300520088400316592002801200650002101228650001101249650001201260650000801272650002601280650001101306650001301317650001501330650001101345651001401356651002001370700001901390700001901409773013201428856008101560852000901641655001201650IND60743514020221118024956.0210707e202104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074351402DNAL7 a10.1134/S20751117210200412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBega, A.

It is shown that Ae. albopictus spread from the Black Sea coast of the Caucasus deep into the European part of Russia from 2017 to 2019. The northern boundary of distribution of this species in 2019 passed through the towns of Timashevsk and Kropotkin and city of Armavir. The limiting environmental parameters at the preimaginal stages of Ae. albopictus development are the content of water-dissolved oxygen and water acidity. According to our assumption, air humidity and the floristic composition of the environment are the main factors determining the expansion of mosquito Aedes albopictus deep into the Russian Plain.

From the results, significant linear relationships were found between pteridine fluorescence and the age of the adults maintained at 16, 20, 24, 28 or 32 °C (P < 0.001, r² > 0.85). In addition, the relationships between the rate of pteridine accumulation and temperature were well described using linear equations for adult females and males. Then for each cohort of the flies at the ambient temperature, a calendar was constructed and used to determine the ages of females and males, respectively, in which was recorded in reverse time order the amount of pteridine accumulated per hour by the flies and their expected pteridine level when they emerged at the specified time. A significant linear relationship between estimated ages and chronological ages was observed for female or male adults, with the mean errors of the estimated ages of ±1.82 days for females and ±1.58 days for males. It is suggested that pteridine fluorescence analysis has a potential value in determining the age of adult B. peregrina.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSarcophaga peregrina 3aadults 3aambient temperature 3aequations 3afemales 3afluorescence 3amales 2aAging 2aAnimals 2aEntomologyxmethods 2aFemale 2aFluorescence 2aForensic Sciencesxmethods 2aMale 2aPteridinesxchemistry 2aSarcophagidaexchemistryxphysiology. 2aTemperature1 aYE, G.

The role of radial transport pathway on the Cd translocation from root to shoot among wheat genotypes are still poorly understood. This study explored the role of apoplastic and symplastic pathway on root Cd uptake and root-to-shoot translocation in Zhenmai 10 (ZM10, high Cd in grains) and Aikang 58 (AK58, low Cd in grains). Under Cd treatment, the deposition of Casparian strips (CSs) and suberin lamellae (SL) initiated closer to the root apex in ZM10 than that in AK58, which resulted in the lower Cd concentration in apoplastic fluid of ZM10. Simultaneously, Cd-induced expression levels of genes related to Cd uptake in roots were significantly higher in AK58 by contrast with ZM10, contributing to the symplastic Cd accumulation in AK58 root. Moreover, the addition of metabolic inhibitor CCCP noticeably decreased the Cd accumulation in root of both genotypes. Intriguingly, compared to ZM10, greater amounts of Cd were sequestrated in the cell walls and vacuoles in roots of AK58, limiting the translocation of Cd from root to shoot. Furthermore, the elevated TaHMA2 expression in ZM10 indicates that ZM10 had a higher capacity of xylem loading Cd than AK58. All of these results herein suggest that the radial transport is significant for Cd accumulation in roots, but it cannot explain the difference in root-to-shoot translocation of Cd in wheat genotypes with contrast Cd accumulation in grains.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTriticum aestivum 3aapoplastic fluids 3acadmium 3acomparative study 3apollution 3asuberin 3asymplast 3awheat 3axylem 0aApoplastic barriers 0aSymplastic transport 0aTranslocation 0aWheat genotype1 aLu, Min1 aTao, Qi1 aLuo, Jipeng1 aLi, Jinxing1 aGuo, Xinyu1 aLiang, Yongchao1 aYang, Xiaoe1 aLi, Tingqiang0 tEnvironmental pollution.g2020 Nov., v. 266 p.115235-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl41014x0269-74917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2020.1152353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02247naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100003000147245011100177300001600288520097600304592002801280650000801308650002501316650001701341650001801358650002401376650001601400650001601416650003401432650001101466650002301477650001201500650001501512653002301527653001601550653001601566653001801582653001401600773012101614856008101735852000901816655001201825IND60556532020221118053716.0190318e201701  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055653202DNAL7 a10.1016/j.lwt.2016.09.0322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRadziejewska-Kubzdela, E.14aThe effect of pretreatment and modified atmosphere packaging on bioactive compound content in coleslaw mix  ap. 505-511.  aThe aim of the study was to determine the effect of soaking in an ascorbic acid and citric acid solution and modified atmosphere packaging on bioactive compound contents and antioxidant activity in a coleslaw mix stored for 12 d at 4 °C. Samples were packaged under modified atmosphere consisting of 5/10/85, 20/25/55, 50/30/20, 70/30/0% O2/CO2/N2, and in air. Soaking of tested samples in the solution of ascorbic and citric acids caused a significant increase in ascorbic acid contents and a more efficient retention of phenolic compounds and carotenoids. The application of packaging in the atmosphere with reduced oxygen contents resulted in a higher content of ascorbic acid. The greatest content of carotenoids was recorded in air-packaged samples and those packaged in the atmosphere of 5/10/85 or 20/25/55% O2/CO2/N2. Contents of phenolic compounds and antioxidant activity were significantly greater in vegetable mixes packaged at 20% or 50% oxygen contents.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3aascorbic acid 3abioactive compounds 3acarotenoids 3acitric acid 3amodified atmosphere packaging 3aoxygen 3aphenolic compounds 3asoaking 3avegetables 0aMinimal processing 0aHigh oxygen 0aCarotenoids 0aAscorbic acid 0aPhenolics0 tLebensmittel-Wissenschaft + Technologie.g2017 Jan., v. 75 p.505-511dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl1644x0023-64387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lwt.2016.09.0323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02897naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005900150245013600209300001600345500001900361520164300380592002802023650001602051650001402067650001902081650002302100650001802123650001302141650002102154700001802175700002202193700002202215700001602237700006002253773011702313856008402430852000902514655001202523IND60725568720221118101755.0210126e20210111xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072556872DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.macromol.0c022782doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYoshimoto, Yuta1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6809-927610aMolecular Insights into the Mechanical Properties of Polymer–Fullerene Bulk Heterojunctions for Organic Photovoltaic Applications  ap. 958-969.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aWe investigate the mechanical properties of π-conjugated polymeric materials composed of regioregular poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) and fullerene C₆₀ using coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations. Specifically, we perform tensile simulations of P3HT:C₆₀ composites with varied degrees of polymerization and C₆₀ mass fractions to obtain their stress–strain responses. Decomposition of a stress tensor into kinetic energy and virial contributions indicates that the tensile moduli of the pure P3HT samples are greatly dependent on nonbonded interactions and on bonded interactions associated with bond stretching, while the addition of C₆₀ leads to an increase in the tensile modulus originating from enhanced nonbonded interactions associated with C₆₀. Additionally, the tensile strength of the P3HT:C₆₀ samples correlates well with molecular chain entanglements, which are characterized by the average number of kinks per chain obtained from primitive path analysis. We also find that the upper and lower yield points characterizing strain softening become more pronounced with an increasing C₆₀ mass fraction. Persistent homology analysis indicates that the emergence of the yield points correlates well with the coalescence of microvoids in the course of tensile deformation, resulting in the generation of larger voids. These results provide a fundamental understanding of the molecular determinants of the mechanical properties of π-conjugated polymer–fullerene composites, which can also help to interpret and predict the mechanical properties of other polymer composites containing fullerene.  aPublisher supplied data 3adeformation 3afullerene 3akinetic energy 3amolecular dynamics 3apath analysis 3apolymers 3atensile strength1 aSugiyama, Sou1 aShimada, Shuntaro1 aKaneko, Toshihiro1 aTakagi, Shu1 aKinefuchi, Ikuya1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1680-59810 tMacromolecules.g2021 Jan. 11, v. 54, no. 2 p.958-969dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23616x1520-58357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.macromol.0c022783Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03556naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245011800168300001800286520133800304536029001642592002801932596010201960596011502062596006902177596011102246650001602357650001702373650003102390650001002421650001602431650001602447650000902463650001802472650002102490650001002511650001102521653002602532653001602558653000902574653003502583653002002618700001302638700001802651700001602669700001902685700001902704700002502723700001802748773014202766856008502908852000902993655001203002IND60612449820221121163602.0180905e20180919xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061244982DNAL7 a10.1080/15226514.2018.14603072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYuan, Haiyan10aExogenous glutathione increased lead uptake and accumulation in Iris lactea var. chinensis exposed to excess lead  ap. 1136-1143.  aLong- and short-term hydroponic experiments were conducted to study the effect of different concentrations of exogenous glutathione (GSH) on Pb uptake, translocation, and gene expresses in Iris lactea var. chinensis exposed to excess lead (Pb). Exogenous GSH remarkedly promoted Pb uptake and translocation in long-term (14 d) experiment, and the GSH-dose-dependent increases in shoot and root Pb contents existed obviously when GSH concentrations were lower than 800 mg·L⁻¹. The fresh weight in gradual rise in plants was observed with the increase of exogenous GSH concentration. In short-term (24 h) experiment, Pb contents in roots under Pb with L-buthionine sulfoximine (BSO, a known inhibitor of GSH biosynthesis) treatments were significantly lower than that under Pb exposure alone. The transcript levels of three genes (Ilγ-ECS, IlGS, and IlPCS) involved in GSH synthesis and metabolism, showed no significant change in expression pattern except that upregulation after 24 h of treatment with Pb and GSH in comparison with that of the single Pb treatment. Further, the level of IlGS transcript after exposure for 4 h was much higher than that of Ilγ-ECS and IlPCS transcripts. All these results obtained here suggest that exogenous GSH can increase Pb accumulation, detoxification, and translocation to the shoot.  aPublic Science and Technology Research Funds Projects of Ocean, No. 201505023.

This study compared haemodynamic changes during an active orthostatic test in adult patients with type 1 diabetes (T1DM), using low versus high RR E/I ratios as a marker of CAN. METHODS: A total of 20 T1DM patients with low RR E/I ratios were compared with 20 T1DM patients with normal RR E/I ratios, matched for gender (1/1 ratio), age (mean: 46years) and diabetes duration (22–26years); 40 matched healthy subjects served as controls. All subjects were evaluated by continuous monitoring of arterial blood pressure (Finapres®) and heart rate using a standardized posture test (1-min standing, 1-min squatting, 1-min standing), thus allowing calculation of baroreflex gain. RESULTS: Compared with controls, T1DM patients showed lower RR E/I ratios, reduced baroreflex gains, higher pulsatile stress (pulse pressure×heart rate), greater squatting-induced pulse pressure rises, orthostatic hypotension and reduced reflex tachycardia. Compared with T1DM patients with preserved RR E/I ratios, T1DM patients with low RR E/I ratios showed reduced post-standing reflex tachycardia and baroreflex gain, and delayed blood pressure recovery, but no markers of increased pulsatile stress. Interestingly, decreased baroreflex gain was significantly associated with both pulsatile stress and microalbuminuria. CONCLUSION: The use of RR E/I ratios to separate T1DM patients allows the detection of other CAN markers during an orthostatic posture test, but with no significant differences in pulsatile stress or microalbuminuria.

Flood modelling is an enduring challenge, especially over the data-sparse mountainous regions such as the Himalayas, due to the lack of accurate rainfall measurements. Global datasets are often employed for flood modelling; however, their applicability over the Himalayan terrain is still uncertain. In this regard, the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) numerical weather prediction model is increasingly used to obtain reliable rainfall estimates. This work aims at evaluating the performance of different reanalysis datasets, satellite product, and the WRF model to represent heavy rainfall over the Himalayan terrain. Further, these datasets are used to drive the Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) hydrologic model to assess their ability to reconstruct floods in the Himalayan region. A Rainfall-Flood Skill Score (RFSS) is proposed in this work to rank different rainfall datasets in the order of their ability to represent flooding in the region. The range of RFSS can vary from -∞ to 1, with positive values as the desired value. The analysis is conducted over the upstream part of the Upper Ganga Basin, spanning from high elevation mountains to the foothills of the Himalayas for three heavy rainfall events that caused flooding in the region. Quantitative evaluation of rainfall datasets in terms of bias, RMSE, and scale errors shows high spatial variability with different datasets performing differently over various regions of the study area. The topography is observed to influence the performance of rainfall datasets. Based on the error metrics, it is found that the rainfall simulated using the WRF model exhibits least error in high elevation and valley regions of the Himalayas, whereas, Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) Multisatellite Precipitation Analysis (TMPA) and Climate Forecast System Reanalysis (CFSR, in some cases) datasets can capture the rainfall in the foothills of the Himalayas. On forcing the VIC model with these datasets, the WRF model with a moderate resolution of 9 km is found to have an overall highest RFSS score of 0.97 among all the datasets and, therefore, considered most suitable for simulating floods in the study region.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaltitude 3abasins 3aclimate 3adata collection 3ahydrologic models 3alandscapes 3amountains 3aquantitative analysis 3arain 3asatellites 3aweather forecasting 3aweather research and forecasting model 3aHimalayan region 0aFloods 0aReanalysis data 0aWRF model 0aVIC hydrologic model 0aRainfall-flood skill score1 aMujumdar, P.P.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9493-83280 tJournal of hydrology.g2020 Sept., v. 588 p.125090-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl46539x0022-16947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2020.1250903Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01343naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245011400170300001600284520030600300592002800606650000900634650001200643650001200655651001100667653000800678653000800686653002400694653001800718653002400736700001700760700001700777773010500794856008500899852000900984655001200993IND60599772420221122134401.0180702e201306  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059977242DNAL7 a10.1016/j.econlet.2013.03.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Zhiyong,10aManagerial optimism and post-financing stock performance in Taiwan: A comparison of debt and equity financing  ap. 332-335.  aWe compare post-financing stock performance for debt-issuing portfolio with equity-issuing one in Taiwan to identify whether firms’ financing decisions were driven by managerial optimism or market timing.

This research develops a new model framework integrating a soil and water assessment tool (SWAT) for hydrological simulation of the river basin, Borg many-objective evolutionary algorithm (Borg MOEA) for optimization, and a software for many-objective robust decision making (OpenMORDM) to minimize these uncertainties and identifying the most robust waste load allocation plans resisting the impact of system uncertainties. This framework has been applied to the Golgol River basin, Iran, which is the main source of the Ilam dam water supply. In this study, first, temperature and precipitation were predicted in 2080–2099. Then, The SWAT model was used to simulate runoff and biochemical oxygen demand (BOD). Afterward, by specifying the objective functions, the Borg MOEA produced the most optimal waste load allocation scenarios in the driest month of the future (August), So that the amount of BOD in the dam reservoir remains less than 5 mg/L. In the next step, the robustness of the solutions analyzed using OpenMORDM. Then, the results were analyzed using the patient rule induction method (PRIM) and classification and regression tree (CART) methods to identify the system vulnerability domains and minimizing false positives. Through the analysis, four climate scenarios have been used to explain how the methodological selection of them affects the resulting candidate planning solutions. The results indicated that individual design selections from the water managers or researchers could influence the efficacy of the model framework, which in turn results in failure of the most robust waste-load allocation strategies under future climate change.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSoil and Water Assessment Tool model 3aalgorithms 3abiochemical oxygen demand 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3acomputer software 3apatients 3aregression analysis 3arunoff 3atemperature 3awater supply 3awatersheds 3aIran 0aRobust decision making 0aBorg many-objective evolutionary algorithm 0aDeep uncertainty 0aScenario discovery 0aGolgol River basin1 aNiksokhan, Mohammad Hossein1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8172-696X0 tJournal of hydrology.g2020 Sept., v. 588 p.125091-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl46539x0022-16947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2020.1250913Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04102naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245018100169520233500350592002802685650004302713650001202756650002202768650002002790650002602810650001702836653002702853653001902880653001202899653002002911653000802931653000802939653000702947653000902954653000902963653000902972653000702981653000902988653001002997653000803007653000803015653001103023653000903034653000803043653000803051653001003059653000903069653000803078653001203086653000903098653000703107700002203114700002303136700002003159700005703179700002303236773011003259856008603369852000903455655001203464IND60730168920221122024115.0220621e20210501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073016892DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jchromb.2021.1226052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 avan Andel, L.14aThe development and validation of a high performance liquid chromatography method to determine the radiochemical purity of [177Lu]Lu-HA-DOTA-TATE in pharmaceutical preparations  aLutetium-177 [¹⁷⁷Lu] tetra-azacyclododecanetetra-acetic acid [DOTA]-(Tyr3)-octreotate [TATE] ([¹⁷⁷Lu]Lu-DOTA-TATE) is a radiopeptide used for peptide receptor radionuclide therapy in patients with neuroendocrine tumours (NETs). This radiopeptide is made by labelling the ligand octreotate with Lutetium-177 using the linker DOTA. After labelling, and before clinical application quality control of the radiopeptide is needed and the radiochemical purity is assessed. Acceptance limits for radiochemical purity should be within 90–110% of the label claim for radiopharmaceuticals for diagnostic use and within 95–105% of the label claim for radiopharmaceuticals for therapeutic use. Moreover, the amount of unlabelled [¹⁷⁷Lu]LuCl₃ cannot exceed 2% of the radioactive dose. Since no monograph is available for [¹⁷⁷Lu]Lu-DOTA-TATE in the European Pharmacopeia (Ph Eur), this article describes the development and validation of a high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method with ultraviolet (UV) detection and radiodetection. A Waters Acquity Arc UHPLC system equipped with a Waters 2998 photodiode array (PDA) detector was used coupled to a Berthold Lb 514 Flowstar detector equipped with a BGO-X gamma measuring cell. A reversed phase Symmetry Shield C18 column (4.6 mm × 250 mm, 5 µm) was used for chromatographic separation. A flow of 1.5 mL/min was maintained during analysis, using 0.1% TFA in water as mobile phase A and 0.1% TFA in ACN as mobile phase B. The retention time was around 1.7 min and 13.5 min for [¹⁷⁷Lu]LuCl₃ and [¹⁷⁷Lu]Lu-HA-DOTA-TATE, respectively. Stock solutions of [¹⁷⁷Lu]LuCl₃ were made by serial dilution and were injected to test for linearity, accuracy and precision, carry over and signal-to-noise ratio. A [¹⁷⁷Lu]Lu-HA-DOTA-TATE sample was prepared and injected to determine the carry over. The results showed that the method is linear over a range of 0.300–130 MBq/mL, which covers the range for clinical samples, provided that the clinical sample is diluted ten times before analysis. The LLOQ can be measured accurately even after dilution, with a signal-to-noise ratio of at least 5. In short, the method is accurate, precise and sensitive and can be implemented as part of the quality control of [¹⁷⁷Lu]Lu-HA-DOTA-TATE.  aPublisher supplied data 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3aligands 3apeptide receptors 3aquality control 3asignal-to-noise ratio 3atherapeutics 0a[177Lu]Lu-HA-DOTA-TATE 0aRadiolabelling 0aHPLC-RA 0aQuality control 0aACN 0aART 0aCV 0aDOTA 0aEDQM 0aEDTA 0aHA 0aLLOQ 0a177Lu 0aNET 0aPDA 0aPh Eur 0aPRRT 0aSOP 0aSSA 0aSSTRs 0aTATE 0aTFA 0a(U)HPLC 0aULOQ 0aUV1 aAalbersberg, E.A.1 aGeluk-Jonker, M.M.1 aStokkel, M.P.M.1 aBeijnen, J.H.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0118-561X1 aHendrikx, J.J.M.A.0 tJournal of chromatography.g2021 May 01, v. 1171 p.122605-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12459x1570-02327nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jchromb.2021.1226053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01480naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001400151245004700165300001400212520040300226592002800629650002100657650001500678650001000693650002500703650001600728651001000744651001800754653000800772653000800780653000800788653000800796653001900804653001800823653002600841700001800867773010300885856008500988852000901073655001201082IND60599772520221122134418.0180702e201307  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059977252DNAL7 a10.1016/j.econlet.2013.03.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYu, Jihai10aHow uncertain is household income in China  ap. 74-78.  aThis paper studies the stochastic processes of household income in China using longitudinal data from CHNS 1989–2009.

In this study, we used a transcriptome-based gene regulatory association network to search for transcription factor genes that could play a role in increasing carbon flow through pathways associated with these processes to increase biomass yield in switchgrass. Two novel switchgrass transcription factors, PvBMY1 (BioMass Yield 1, belonging to the APETALA2/Ethylene Response Factor family of transcription factors) and PvBMY3 (BioMass Yield 3, a member of the Nuclear-Factor Y family of transcription factors), with predicted roles in the regulation of photosynthesis and related metabolism were identified. These genes were overexpressed in switchgrass to determine their impact on biomass yield. A significant increase in both aboveground and root biomass was observed in transgenic greenhouse grown plants compared to wild-type control plants with the best line producing 160% more aboveground biomass than controls. Transgenic lines with elevated electron transport rate of photosystems I and II as well as increased levels of starch and soluble sugars were identified.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPanicum virgatum 3aaboveground biomass 3abiomass production 3acarbon 3acarbon dioxide fixation 3acarbon metabolism 3acrop yield 3aelectron transfer 3agene overexpression 3agenes 3agenetically modified organisms 3agreenhouses 3aphotosynthesis 3astarch 3asugars 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranscription factors 0aTF 0aTranscription factor 0aBiomass 0aCrop yield 0aSwitchgrass 0aPhotosynthesis1 aAli, Aminat1 aRyan, Kieran P.1 aPeoples, Oliver1 aSnell, Kristi D.1 aSomleva, Maria N.0 tPlant science.g2018 Aug., v. 273 p.100-109dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl38764x0168-94527nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.plantsci.2018.04.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04342naa a2200673 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001700094024002100111024003800132024002200170024001900192024001100211040001800222100002500240245011200265506007600377506017300453520190800626506003702534650000802571650002502579650001302604650003102617650001402648650002502662650002102687650001002708650002202718650001302740650001302753650001502766650001502781650001102796650001402807650001402821650002502835650001402860650002202874650001002896650001902906650001302925650001402938700002302952700002102975700002402996700002303020700002303043700002003066700002503086773011603111856011203227856008403339956021503423961000903638852000903647655001203656IND60006124420221214223753.0150817e20140819xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6000612442DNAL7 a3009472aris7 a10113/612442hdl7 a10.1371/journal.pone.01037872doi7 aPMC41381022pmcid7 a251370962pmid8 ans7898  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrockmeier, Susan L.10aVirulence and Draft Genome Sequence Overview of Multiple Strains of the Swine Pathogen Haemophilus parasuis  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aWorks produced by employees of the U.S. Government as part of their official duties are not copyrighted within the U.S. The content of this document is not copyrighted.  aHaemophilus parasuis is the cause of Glässer’s disease in swine, which is characterized by systemic infection resulting in polyserositis, meningitis, and arthritis. Characterization of this animal disease is complicated by the enormous differences in the severity of disease caused by H. parasuis strains, ranging from lethal systemic disease to subclinical carriage. To identify differences in genotype that could account for virulence phenotypes, we established the virulence of, and performed whole genome sequence analysis on, 11 H. parasuis strains, 10 of which were sequenced as part of this study. Virulence was assessed by evaluating morbidity and mortality following intranasal challenge of caesarian-derived, colostrum-deprived (CDCD) pigs. Genomic DNA from strains Nagasaki, 12939, SW140, 29755, MN-H, 84-15995, SW114, H465, D74, and 174 was used to generate Illumina paired-end libraries for genomic sequencing and de novo assembly. H. parasuis strains Nagasaki, 12939, SH0165, SW140, 29755, and MN-H exhibited a high level of virulence. Despite minor distinctions among these groups, all pigs challenged with these strains developed clinical signs consistent with Glässer’s disease between 1-7 days post-challenge. H. parasuis strains 84-15995 and SW114 were moderately virulent, in that approximately half of the pigs infected with each developed Glässer’s disease. H. parasuis strains H465, D74, and 174 were minimally virulent or avirulent in the CDCD pig model. Comparative genomic analysis among strains identified several noteworthy differences in coding regions. These coding regions include predicted outer membrane, metabolism, and pilin or adhesin related genes, some of which likely contributed to the differences in virulence and systemic disease observed following challenge. These data will be useful for identifying H. parasuis virulence factors and vaccine targets.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDNA 3aHaemophilus parasuis 3aadhesins 3aanimal pathogenic bacteria 3aarthritis 3abacterial infections 3adisease severity 3agenes 3agenomic libraries 3agenomics 3agenotype 3ameningitis 3ametabolism 3amodels 3amorbidity 3amortality 3anucleotide sequences 3aphenotype 3asequence analysis 3aswine 3aswine diseases 3avaccines 3avirulence1 aRegister, Karen B.1 aKuehn, Joanna S.1 aNicholson, Tracy L.1 aLoving, Crystal L.1 aBayles, Darrell O.1 aShore, Sarah M.1 aPhillips, Gregory J.0 tPlos One.g2014 Aug. 19, v. 9, no. 8 p.e103787-dPublic Library of SciencewJournal:jnl4277198x1932-62037nnas40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/612443Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.01037873Available from publisher's site  aARIS submissionbhttp://submit-u.nal.usda.gov/system/files/submissions/Virulence%20and%20Draft%20Genome%20Sequence%20Overview%20of%20Multiple%20Strains%20of%20the%20Swine%20Pathogen%20Haemophilus%20parasuis.pdf  aUSDA  aDNAL 7aarticle02963naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001300150245011600163300001600279520168200295592002801977650001102005650001302016650001202029650001002041650001802051650001202069650001202081650002202093650002202115650001302137650001402150650002302164650002202187700002802209700001502237700001602252700001402268700001702282773010202299856008402401990002302485852000902508655001202517IND60094823520221121222837.0141104e201204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009482352DNAL7 a10.1016/j.diabet.2011.12.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKlee, P.12aA novel ABCC8 mutation illustrates the variability of the diabetes phenotypes associated with a single mutation  ap. 179-182.  aAIM: ATP-sensitive potassium channels are important regulators of insulin secretion. They consist of four sulphonylurea receptor (encoded by ABCC8) and four inwardly rectifying protein (encoded by KCNJ11) subunits. Activating ABCC8 mutations lead to decreased insulin secretion and to diabetes. Wide phenotype variability is associated with single ABCC8 mutations, ranging from transient or permanent neonatal diabetes (ND) with or without developmental delay (DEND syndrome) to very mild phenotypes. This report describes the case of a Caucasian infant diagnosed with ND at the age of 2months due to a novel ABCC8 missense mutation. METHODS: ABCC8 was analyzed by sequence analysis. The mutation was present in the patient and her family and was found to be associated with phenotypes ranging from ND to asymptomatic impaired fasting glucose (IFG). RESULTS: A novel His863Tyr ABCC8 mutation was identified in a 2-month-old girl diagnosed with ND. After an initial insulin treatment, treatment with glibenclamide was initiated and the treatment with insulin discontinued. The same mutation was found in her father, who had been fortuitously diagnosed with diabetes and had an HbA₁c level of 9% (74.8mmol/mol). The patient's brother and mother both had normal fasting glucose, and were not found to be carriers of the mutation. However, the same mutation was found in her grandmother, who had been asymptomatic and discovered IFG (6.9mmol/L) with an HbA₁c of 6.8% (50.8mmol/mol). CONCLUSION: This case describes a novel ABCC8 mutation and offers a further illustration of the highly variable phenotypes associated with an identical mutation present across three generations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aWhites 3adiabetes 3afasting 3agirls 3aglibenclamide 3aglucose 3ainsulin 3ainsulin secretion 3amissense mutation 3apatients 3aphenotype 3apotassium channels 3asequence analysis1 aBellanné-Chantelot, C.1 aDepret, G.1 aLlano, J.P.1 aPaget, C.1 aNicolino, M.0 tDiabetes and metabolism.g2012 Apr., v. 38, no. 2 p.179-182dElsevier Masson SASx1262-36367nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.diabet.2011.12.0013Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03118naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245015700171300001600328520147900344592002801823650001901851650001801870650002601888650003001914650002901944650002301973650001901996650001602015650002102031650001802052650002002070653002702090653001702117653002002134653002002154653001702174700006002191700002902251700002202280700002802302700002002330700001702350700002902367700002102396773010002417856008602517852000902603655001202612IND60615788420221120042154.0201202e201812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061578842DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecolind.2018.08.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMohd-Nor, Diana10aAlcaligenaceae and Chromatiaceae as reliable bioindicators present in palm oil mill effluent final discharge treated by different biotreatment processes  ap. 468-473.  aThis study was undertaken to confirm the reliability of the proposed potential bioindicators, Alcaligenaceae and Chromatiaceae to specifically indicate contamination in river water by palm oil mill effluent (POME) final discharge. The use of bioindicators could assist in determining the specific cause of contamination in water bodies. Alcaligenaceae and Chromatiaceae were shown by a previous study to be present in river water contaminated with the final discharge from the treatment of POME. In the present study, the compositions of the bacterial communities in the POME final discharge obtained from four different palm oil mills which used different biotreatments of POME were elucidated using high-throughput MiSeq. The four POME final discharges studied showed different species richness and evenness among them. However, the bacterial community compositions in the different final discharges exhibited almost similar patterns in that the phylum Proteobacteria was dominant in all the samples. The proposed bioindicators, the Alcaligenaceae and Chromatiaceae families, were found to be present in all the four final discharges despite the different characteristics of the mills and the different biotreatment processes used by them. These bioindicators were also strongly and positively correlated with the biochemical oxygen demand (BOD₅) concentration. This makes them reliable bacterial indicators to detect the presence of POME final discharge in river water.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAlcaligenaceae 3aChromatiaceae 3abacterial communities 3abiochemical oxygen demand 3aenvironmental indicators 3aoil mill effluents 3apalm oil mills 3ariver water 3aspecies richness 3asurface water 3awater pollution 0aPalm oil mill effluent 0aBioindicator 0aFinal discharge 0aRiver pollution 0aBiotreatment1 aRamli, Norhayati1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8015-86541 aSharuddin, Siti Suhailah1 aHassan Mohd.

Alan10aPerformance Evaluations of Three Silt Fence Practices Using a Full-Scale Testing Apparatus  aErosion and sediment controls on construction sites minimize environmental impacts from sediment-laden stormwater runoff. Silt fence, a widely specified perimeter control practice on construction projects used to retain sediment on-site, has limited performance-based testing data. Silt fence failures and resultant sediment losses are often the result of structural failure. To better understand silt fence performance, researchers at the Auburn University-Erosion and Sediment Control Testing Facility (AU-ESCTF) have evaluated three silt fence options to determine possible shortcomings using standardized full-scale testing methods. These methods subject silt fence practices to simulated, in-field conditions typically experienced on-site without the variability of field testing or the limited application of small-scale testing. Three different silt fence practices were tested to evaluate performance, which included: (1) Alabama Department of Transportation (ALDOT) Trenched Silt Fence, (2) ALDOT Sliced Silt Fence, and (3) Alabama Soil and Water Conservation Committee (AL-SWCC) Trenched Silt Fence. This study indicates that the structural performance of a silt fence perimeter control is the most important performance factor in retaining sediment. The sediment retention performance of these silt fence practices was 82.7%, 66.9% and 90.5%, respectively. When exposed to large impoundment conditions, both ALDOT Trench and Sliced Silt Fence practices failed structurally, while the AL-SWCC Trenched Silt Fence did not experience structural failure.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenvironmental impact 3asilt 3asoil 3astormwater 3atransportation 3awater conservation 3aAlabama1 aDonald, Wesley1 aZech, Wesley1 aPerez, Michael0 tWater.g2017 July 11, v. 9, no. 7dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21688x2073-44417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w90705023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03387naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245017000169500001900339520180700358592002802165650002202193650001502215650001202230650002202242650001602264650002002280650001302300650001502313650001402328650000902342650002002351650002302371650001502394650002002409653002502429653002702454653001902481653001502500653002102515653002202536653002502558700002102583700002002604700001802624700002602642773010702668856008502775852000902860655001202869IND60702609520221122130000.0210114e202011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070260952DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envpol.2020.1151722doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOrdonez, Diana10aAdsorption thermodynamics and kinetics of Advanced Green Environmental Media (AGEM) for nutrient removal and recovery in agricultural discharge and stormwater runoff  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aRecycled materials were used in three types of green sorption media for nutrient removal and possible recovery in high nutrient-laden agricultural discharge and stormwater runoff. The three types of green sorption media included in this comparative study were two new aluminum-based green environmental media (AGEM) and one existing iron-filings based green environmental media (IFGEM). The corresponding adsorption isotherm, thermodynamics, and kinetics models were simulated based on isotherm studies to determine their removal efficiency and potential for recovery of nitrate, phosphate, and ammonia when used as a soil amendment in crop fields or in a filter for water treatment. AGEM-2 exhibited the shortest contact time required to achieve nutrient removal above 80% with an average of 7 h, followed by AGEM-1 and IFGEM with 10.6 and 28 h, respectively. Natural soil was included as a control and exhibited minimal nutrient removal. Ammonia, which may be recovered as fertilizer for drop fields in a soil-water-waste nexus, was generated by all three green sorption media mixes, therefore indicating their potential for use as soil amendments in agricultural and forested land after engineering filter applications. The kinetics analysis indicated that nitrate adsorption follows pseudo-first-order kinetics, while phosphate adsorption follows pseudo-second-order kinetics. The Gibbs free energy indicated that most of the adsorption reactions proceeded as exothermic. Lastly, a few equilibrium models, including the Langmuir, Freundlich, First Modified Langmuir, Temkin, Jovanovic, and Elovich models, were ranked and three were selected for use with IFGEM, AGEM-1, and AGEM-2, respectively, as below: (1) Langmuir, (2) Freundlich, and (3) First Modified Langmuir, according to three indices.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGibbs free energy 3aadsorption 3aammonia 3acomparative study 3afertilizers 3aheat production 3anitrates 3aphosphates 3apollution 3asoil 3asoil amendments 3asorption isotherms 3astormwater 3awater treatment 0aGreen sorption media 0aSoil-water-waste nexus 0aIsotherm study 0aBiomimicry 0aNutrient removal 0aNutrient recovery 0aEquilibrium modeling1 aValencia, Andrea1 aElhakiem, Hanan1 aChang, Ni-Bin1 aWanielista, Martin P.0 tEnvironmental pollution.g2020 Nov., v. 266 p.115172-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl41014x0269-74917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2020.1151723Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02163naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002400152245012300176300001400299520089600313592002801209650001101237650001101248650001001259650001801269650001601287650001301303650001001316650002001326650003301346650001001379653001901389653002001408653001901428653002701447653001601474700001801490700002801508773010901536856008701645852000901732655001201741IND60560390920221120184257.0190318e201704  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056039092DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jfoodeng.2016.12.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMahadevappa, Jyothi10aFuzzy logic based process control strategy for effective sheeting of wheat dough in small and medium-sized enterprises  ap. 93-99.  aOne of the prime aspects in small and medium-sized baking enterprises (SMEs) is to control and improve the dough sheeting process. Dough sheeting is an important phase in producing various baked products such as breads, pastries, pizza etc. This is one of the key feature that helps to achieve optimized timing and product quality. The deployment of a fuzzy control system is one of the feasible option when complexity of the process is high. The fuzzy control system (program) developed in this research can regulate the roll gaps based on the input parameters such as dough thickness, rheological measurements and surface cracks. The results demonstrated that by the implementation of a fuzzy system an optimized dough sheeting method is achieved. On comparison of the results with a non-fuzzy system, the dough was rolled in less time without making any compromise with the dough quality.  aPublisher supplied data 3abaking 3abreads 3adough 3adough quality 3afuzzy logic 3apastries 3apizza 3aprocess control 3asmall and medium enterprises 3awheat 0aDough sheeting 0aProcess control 0aSurface cracks 0aRheological properties 0aFuzzy logic1 aGroß, Frauke1 aDelgado, A.q(Antonio),0 tJournal of food engineering.g2017 Apr., v. 199 p.93-99dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl34294x0260-87747nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jfoodeng.2016.12.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02683naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245010200172300001600274500001900290520114300309592002801452650001501480650002401495650002301519650002101542650002701563650001101590700005901601700002501660700006201685700002001747700002401767700005901791700002201850700005501872700006001927700006401987773011702051856008402168852000902252655001202261IND60725569220210903000000.0210126e20210111xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072556922DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.macromol.0c023452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMaguire, Shawn M.10aInterfacial Compatibilization in Ternary Polymer Nanocomposites: Comparing Theory and Experiments  ap. 797-811.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aIn this work, we examine binary and ternary nanocomposites of poly(methyl methacrylate) grafted silica nanoparticles (PMMA-NP), in poly(styrene-ran-acrylonitrile) (SAN), and poly(methyl methacrylate) matrices as a platform to directly probe governing parameters guiding phase behavior and nanoparticle assembly in composite materials. Through the addition of PMMA matrix chains similar in molecular weight to the grafted PMMA chains and significantly smaller than the SAN matrix chains, we observe increased nanoparticle miscibility in off-critical compositions due to interfacial segregation of PMMA matrix chains. A simple interfacial model provides a general guideline for predicting the extent of compatibilization. Further insights on compatibilization behavior are provided by polymer particle pair correlation functions and structure factors obtained using polymer reference interaction site model theory calculations as well as polymer concentration profiles from molecular dynamics simulations. This study serves as a guideline to facilitate PNC processing and design of materials for a broad range of technological applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aguidelines 3amathematical theory 3amolecular dynamics 3amolecular weight 3apolymer nanocomposites 3asilica1 aKrook, Nadia M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3308-90401 aKulshreshtha, Arjita1 aBilchak, Connor R.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8815-16011 aBrosnan, Robert1 aPana, Andreea-Maria1 aRannou, Patrice1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9376-71361 aMaréchal, Manuel1 aOhno, Kohji1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1812-33541 aJayaraman, Arthi1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5295-45811 aComposto, Russell J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5906-25940 tMacromolecules.g2021 Jan. 11, v. 54, no. 2 p.797-811dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23616x1520-58357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.macromol.0c023453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01310naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245008700171300001600258520029800274592002800572650002200600650001100622653000800633653000800641653000800649653000800657653000800665653001500673653001500688653001300703653001600716700001700732773010500749856008500854852000900939655001200948IND60599772920221122040402.0180702e201308  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059977292DNAL7 a10.1016/j.econlet.2013.03.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHerbertz, Claus10aWhen higher prizes lead to lower efforts—The impact of favoritism in tournaments  ap. 188-191.  aWe investigate the relationship between tournament prices and effort choices in the presence of favoritism.

The fish were reared in two conceptually identical recirculating aquaculture systems (RAS) constructed in a greenhouse. One system was combined with a floating raft hydroponic unit to culture cucumbers (Cucumis sativus) only using the process water. The second system remained without the plant cultivation unit and functioned as the control. Water quality was monitored regularly by measuring dissolved nutrients and physical water parameters. During 87 days, a total of 71 fish from each system (n = 142) were studied, with a final sampling of all fish (n = 107) at the end of the experiment. Blood from the caudal vein was analyzed for the stress hormone cortisol and the glucose concentration. In addition, fish were investigated for external injuries on their skin, fins and barbels. The results demonstrate that the system design had no influence on fish mortalities and growth rates. Furthermore, cortisol and blood glucose levels did not differ significantly between the two systems. However, the number of external injuries was significantly lower in the aquaponics, providing evidence that co-cultivation of fish and plants might offer benefits to the welfare of the fish.  aPublisher supplied data 3aClarias gariepinus 3aCucumis sativus 3aanimal welfare 3aaquaponics 3ablood 3ablood glucose 3acatfish 3acaudal vein 3acoculture 3acortisol 3acucumbers 3afins 3aglucose 3agreenhouses 3ahydroponics 3amortality 3anutrients 3arearing 3arecirculating aquaculture systems 3asystems engineering 3awater quality1 aBrenner, Matthias1 aPalm, Harry W.0 tWater.g2017 July 11, v. 9, no. 7dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21688x2073-44417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w90705043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02765naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245010500171300001600276520106500292536008001357592002801437596008001465650001301545650001501558650001301573650002101586650002101607650002901628650001001657650001901667650001301686650002101699650001401720650001701734650001401751650001901765650001101784650001901795650002101814650001101835651001001846653001901856653001001875653001901885653003301904653001001937700001401947700001301961700001501974773011601989856008502105852000902190655001202199IND60612450420221121202518.0180905e20180703xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061245042DNAL7 a10.1080/15275922.2018.14749752doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Yongyong14aThe characterization of water-soluble inorganic ions in PM2.5 during a winter period in Xi'an, China  ap. 166-171.  aThe characteristics of water-soluble inorganic ions (WSIIs) during a winter period in a suburb of Xi'an, China, were investigated. Our results show that the total mass concentration of the dominant WSIIs (8) was 91.27 µg m–³, accounting for 50.1% of the total mass concentration of PM₂.₅ (particulates with a size of 2.5 µm or less). Secondary inorganic aerosols (SO₄²⁻, NO₃⁻ and NH₄⁺) were the most abundant ions, accounting for up to 95.12% of the total ions. By using the anion and cation equivalence ratio method, PM₂.₅ was shown to have weak alkalinity, and the chemical forms of WSIIs were mainly (NH₄)₂SO₄ and NH₄NO₃. The sulfur oxidation ratio (SOR) and nitrogen oxidation ratio (NOR) suggested that larger proportions of SO₄²⁻ and NO₃⁻ were formed by gas-phase SO₂ and NO₂ in the sampling site. Ratio analysis also indicated that anthropogenic sources significantly contributed to WSII pollution. Among the anthropogenic sources, fixed pollution sources were found to be dominant over mobile sources.  athe Key Consulting Project of Chinese Academy of Engineering 2015-06-XZ-01.  aPublisher supplied data  a2015-06-XZ-01cthe Key Consulting Project of Chinese Academy of Engineering 3aaerosols 3aalkalinity 3aammonium 3aammonium nitrate 3aammonium sulfate 3aanthropogenic activities 3agases 3ainorganic ions 3anitrogen 3anitrogen dioxide 3aoxidation 3aparticulates 3apollution 3asuburban areas 3asulfur 3asulfur dioxide 3awater solubility 3awinter 3aChina 0aAcidic balance 0aPM2.5 0aratio analysis 0awater-soluble inorganic ions 0aXi'an1 aJia, Ying1 aLi, Ming1 aHou, Li'an0 tEnvironmental forensics.g2018 July 3, v. 19, no. 3 p.166-171dTaylor & FranciswJournal:12311x1527-59307nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15275922.2018.14749753Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02815naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100005900152245006400211300001400275520091800289592002801207650002101235650001501256650001501271650001301286650000901299650001901308650001401327650001801341650001401359650000901373650000901382650002001391650000701411650001001418650001901428653002101447653001301468653001901481653002201500653002001522653000801542653003301550653004201583653003701625653005001662653004601712700002401758700002001782700002101802700001801823700001801841700002301859700002101882700002101903700001901924700001801943773010801961856008702069852000902156655001202165IND60560391020221120224004.0190318e201705  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056039102DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jfoodeng.2016.12.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShiono, Takashi1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7167-576410aSelective decaffeination of tea extracts by montmorillonite  ap. 13-21.  aWe evaluated the decaffeination of green tea extract via montmorillonite (MMT) to develop a selective and versatile decaffeination technology. MMT is a clay mineral used worldwide in the food industry. MMT adsorbed caffeine with no significant binding to catechins, whereas activated carbon (AC) bound caffeine and catechins simultaneously. This suggests that MMT has a higher selectivity for caffeine adsorption than AC. The taste of the extract decaffeinated by MMT was not significantly altered. MMT stably adsorbed caffeine at 5–35 °C and pH 6–8; however, prolonged incubation caused an undesired elution of Fe ions, which decreases the lightness of green tea beverages. MMT exhibited similar caffeine adsorption properties with various types of tea extracts and a simple caffeine solution. Overall, our findings suggest that MMT is a useful adsorbent for the decaffeination of a range of tea beverages.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactivated carbon 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3acaffeine 3aclay 3adecaffeination 3aflavanols 3afood industry 3agreen tea 3aions 3airon 3amontmorillonite 3apH 3ataste 3atea (beverage) 0aActivated carbon 0aCaffeine 0aDecaffeination 0aLangmuir isotherm 0aMontmorillonite 0aTea 0aCaffeine (PubChem CID: 2519) 0aEpigallocatechin (Pubchem CID: 72277) 0aEpicatechin (Pubchem CID: 72276) 0aEpigallocatechin gallate (Pubchem CID: 65064) 0aEpicatechin gallate (Pubchem CID: 107905)1 aYamamoto, Kenichiro1 aYotsumoto, Yuko1 aKawai, Junichiro1 aImada, Nanami1 aHioki, Jumpei1 aNaganuma, Hiroyuki1 aEguchi, Takahiro1 aKurihara, Makoto1 aYoshida, Aruto1 aDeuchi, Keiji0 tJournal of food engineering.g2017 May, v. 200 p.13-21dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl34294x0260-87747nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jfoodeng.2016.12.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04850naa a2200745 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245008600168300001200254520251500266592002802781596011402809596013302923650001803056650001903074650001303093650001503106650001803121650001903139650001303158650001803171650001603189650001603205650002203221650001703243650001303260650003003273650001703303650002403320650001803344650001403362650001503376650002303391650001603414650001303430650003303443650001503476650001703491650002703508650001303535650001503548650001803563650001803581650002203599651001103621700002103632700001903653700001603672700001803688700002003706700002603726700001703752700002003769700002203789700002103811700002503832773014403857856008204001852000904083655001204092IND60676359220221123042230.0191213e201912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067635922DNAL7 a10.1007/s11274-019-2761-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMardanova, Ayslu10aStructure and variation of root-associated microbiomes of potato grown in alfisol  ap. 181.  aRoot-associated fungi and bacteria play a pivotal role in the plant–soil ecosystem by influencing both plant growth and immunity. The aim of this study was to unravel the biodiversity of the bacterial and fungal rhizosphere (RS) and rhizoplane (RP) microbiota of Zhukovskij rannij potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) cultivar growing in the Alfisol of Tatarstan, Russia. To assess the structure and diversity of microbial communities, we employed the 16S rRNA and internal transcribed spacer gene library technique. Overall, sequence analysis showed the presence of 3982 bacterial and 188 fungal operational taxonomic units (OTUs) in the RP, and 6018 bacterial and 320 fungal OTUs for in the RS. Comparison between microbial community structures in the RS and RP showed significant differences between these compartments. Biodiversity was higher in the RS than in the RP. Although members of Proteobacteria (RS—59.1 ± 4.9%; RP—54.5 ± 9.2%), Bacteroidetes (RS—23.19 ± 10.2%; RP—34.52 ± 10.4%) and Actinobacteria (RS—11.55 ± 4.9%; RP—7.7 ± 5.1%) were the three most dominant phyla, accounting for 94–98% of all bacterial taxa in both compartments, notable variations were observed in the primary dominance of classes and genera in RS and RP samples. In addition, our results demonstrated that the potato rhizoplane was significantly enriched with the genera Flavobacterium, Pseudomonas, Acinetobacter and other potentially beneficial bacteria. The fungal community was predominantly inhabited by members of the Ascomycota phylum (RS—81.4 ± 8.1%; RP—81.7 ± 5.7%), among which the genera Fusarium (RS—10.34 ± 3.41%; RP—9.96 ± 4.79%), Monographella (RS—7.66 ± 4.43%; RP—9.91 ± 5.87%), Verticillium (RS—4.6 ± 1.43%; RP—8.27 ± 3.63%) and Chaetomium (RS—4.95 ± 2.07%; RP—8.33 ± 4.93%) were particularly abundant. Interestingly, potato rhizoplane was significantly enriched with potentially useful fungal genera, such as Mortierella and Metacordiceps. A comparative analysis revealed that the abundance of Fusarium (a cosmopolitan plant pathogen) varied significantly depending on rotation variants, indicating a possible control of phytopathogenic fungi via management-induced shifts through crop rotational methods. Analysis of the core microbiome of bacterial and fungal community structure showed that the formation of bacterial microbiota in the rhizosphere and rhizoplane is dependent on the host plant.  aPublisher supplied data  a16-16-04062cРоссийский Фонд Фундаментальных Исследований (РФФИ)  aАААА-А18-118031390148-1cBasic scientific researchof the Ministry of Science and Higher Education of the Russian Federation 3aAcinetobacter 3aActinobacteria 3aAlfisols 3aChaetomium 3aDNA libraries 3aFlavobacterium 3aFusarium 3aMonographella 3aMortierella 3aPseudomonas 3aSolanum tuberosum 3aVerticillium 3abacteria 3abeneficial microorganisms 3abiodiversity 3acommunity structure 3acrop rotation 3acultivars 3aecosystems 3afungal communities 3ahost plants 3aimmunity 3ainternal transcribed spacers 3amicrobiome 3aplant growth 3aplant pathogenic fungi 3apotatoes 3arhizoplane 3aribosomal DNA 3aribosomal RNA 3asequence analysis 3aRussia1 aLutfullin, Marat1 aHadieva, Guzel1 aAkosah, Yaw1 aPudova, Daria1 aKabanov, Daniil1 aShagimardanova, Elena1 aVankov, Petr1 aVologin, Semyon1 aGogoleva, Natalia1 aStasevski, Zenon1 aSharipova, Margarita0 tWorld journal of microbiology & biotechnology.g2019 Dec., v. 35, no. 12 p.181-181dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl44995x0959-39937nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11274-019-2761-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03206naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100002100138245016500159520152100324592002801845650003101873650001301904650002701917650002601944650001701970650002201987650001202009650001902021650000902040650001402049650001502063650001002078650001802088650002302106650001502129650001802144650001402162650001402176650002902190650001602219651001202235651001202247700001902259700002002278700002402298700003002322700002402352700002102376700002202397700002202419773011802441856007202559852000902631655001202640IND60653230520221122172522.0190714e20170712xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065323052DNAL7 a10.3390/w90705142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIglesias, Carlos10aFish but Not Macroinvertebrates Promote Trophic Cascading Effects in High Density Submersed Plant Experimental Lake Food Webs in Two Contrasting Climate Regions  aPredators play a key role in the functioning of shallow lakes. Differences between the response of temperate and subtropical systems to fish predation have been proposed, but experimental evidence is scarce. To elucidate cascading effects produced by predators in contrasting climatic zones, we conducted a mesocosm experiment in three pairs of lakes in Uruguay and Denmark. We used two typical planktivorous-omnivorous fish species (Jenynsia multidentata + Cnesterodon decemmaculatus and Gasterosteus aculeatus + Perca fluviatilis) and one littoral omnivorous-predatory macroinvertebrate (Palaemonetes argentinus and Gammarus lacustris), alone and combined, in numbers resembling natural densities. Fish predation on zooplankton increased phytoplankton biomass in both climate zones, whereas the effects of predatory macroinvertebrates on zooplankton and phytoplankton were not significant in either climate zone. Macroinvertebrates (that freely colonized the sampling devices) were diminished by fish in both climate areas; however, periphyton biomass did not vary among treatments. Our experiments demonstrated that fish affected the structure of both planktonic and littoral herbivorous communities in both climate regions, with a visible positive cascading effect on phytoplankton biomass, but no effects on periphyton. Altogether, fish impacts appeared to be a strong driver of turbid water conditions in shallow lakes regardless of climatic zone by indirectly contributing to increasing phytoplankton biomass.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCnesterodon decemmaculatus 3aGammarus 3aGasterosteus aculeatus 3aJenynsia multidentata 3aPalaemonetes 3aPerca fluviatilis 3abiomass 3aclimatic zones 3afish 3afood webs 3aherbivores 3alakes 3alittoral zone 3amacroinvertebrates 3aperiphyton 3aphytoplankton 3apredation 3apredators 3asubmerged aquatic plants 3azooplankton 3aDenmark 3aUruguay1 aJeppesen, Erik1 aMazzeo, Néstor1 aPacheco, Juan Pablo1 aMello, Franco Teixeira-de1 aLandkildehus, Frank1 aFosalba, Claudia1 aClemente, Juan M.1 aMeerhoff, Mariana0 tWater.g2017 July 12, v. 9, no. 7dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21688x2073-44417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w90705143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02695naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245008700167520115200254592002801406650001101434650001301445650001501458650001601473650002901489650002401518650004401542650001001586650002001596653001501616653002401631653002701655653002901682653003801711700002201749700001701771700001801788700002201806700005401828700001701882700001901899700001701918700001501935700001701950700001701967773011001984856008602094852000902180655001202189IND60730169620221122024331.0210527e20210530xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073016962DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jchromb.2021.1226142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZoller, Ann10aUHPLC-MS/HRMS method for the quantitation of pyrithione metabolites in human urine  aPyrithione glucuronide (PTG) and 2-thiopyridine glucuronide (ThPG) have been reported to be the major urinary metabolites in multiple animal species following administration of zinc pyrithione (ZnPT). However, the formation of these metabolites has never been confirmed in humans. A simple and rugged ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography high resolution mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/HRMS) method was developed and validated for the quantification of PTG and ThPG to investigate human metabolism of pyrithione following topical application of ZnPT as a shampoo. A UHPLC-MS/HRMS method was required due to the matrix interferences that were observed with the typical industry standard HPLC/tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) methodology based on nominal mass triple quadrupole (QQQ) platform approach. Using UPLC-MS/HRMS, both PTG and ThPG were identified in human urine following topical application of ZnPT. The presence of these human urinary metabolites of pyrithione are consistent with findings from earlier studies in multiple animal species and suggest the metabolism of pyrithione is similar amongst those mammalian species studied.  aPublisher supplied data 3ahumans 3aindustry 3ametabolism 3ametabolites 3atandem mass spectrometry 3atopical application 3aultra-performance liquid chromatography 3aurine 3azinc pyrithione 0aPyrithione 0aUrinary metabolites 0aPyrithione glucuronide 0aThiopyridine glucuronide 0aHigh resolution mass spectrometry1 aWehmeyer, Kenneth1 aKrivos, Kady1 aKarb, Michael1 aStoffolano, Peter1 aNash, J.F.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6133-96391 aBalan, Guhan1 aBehymer, Lynda1 aSeeck, Molly1 aBrum, Jose1 aZou, Yuanshu1 aPrice, Jason0 tJournal of chromatography.g2021 May 30, v. 1173 p.122614-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12459x1570-02327nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jchromb.2021.1226143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02814naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100006600146245009800212300002000310520151300330592002801843650002301871650001401894650001601908650002301924650001801947650002301965650001101988650001801999650001902017650001802036650002002054650001602074700001602090700002602106700002202132773017302154856008002327852000902407655001202416IND60746458420220218000000.0210805e20210715xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074645842DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.iecr.1c017042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRodrigues, Jéssica S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6023-657110aLignin Fractionation Methods: Can Lignin Fractions Be Separated in a True Industrial Process?  ap. 10863-10881.  aLignin is among one of the largest natural resources in the world, with aromatic structures that can serve as a raw material in the synthesis of high value-added chemicals, the production of bioenergy, and the development of carbon-based products, among others. A better understanding of the chemical structure of lignin and its valorization methods is necessary to overcome current technological challenges for industrial scale applications. The main challenge found to provide the most abundant source of aromatics in the world is the fractionation of lignin. Current studies propose a way to fractionate lignin to obtain more homogeneous and less complex fractions, because of the fact that aromatic compounds are essential intermediates in the manufacture of polymers, and lignin is the main source of biologically aromatic-based substrates. Numerous review articles have addressed research aimed at understanding the structure of lignin, however, a limited focus has been given to its fractionation methods. This article aims to review papers published in recent years using different lignin fractionation techniques, focusing on the four main types of fractionations: in organic solvents, gel permeation chromatography in preparatory scale, ultrafiltration and precipitation by varying acid gradient. This a Review summarizes the most recent innovations in the area of biorefineries for the chemical valorization of lignin derived from various botanical sources through different fractionation methods.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaromatic compounds 3abioenergy 3abiorefining 3achemical structure 3afractionation 3agel chromatography 3alignin 3amanufacturing 3aprocess design 3araw materials 3aultrafiltration 3avalue added1 aLima, Vitor1 aAraújo, Luísa C.

This study presents the variation in isotopic composition (δ¹⁸O and δ²H) of daily precipitation samples collected from the Kashmir Valley, North-Western Himalaya, to quantify the effect of meteorological parameters, separately for the Southwest monsoon (SWM) season and the periods of Western Disturbances (WDs). The results suggest that precipitation isotopic composition is strongly modulated by temperature and relative humidity during the periods of WDs. Still, this dependency is weak in the case of the SWM season. Moisture transport pathways calculated from HYSPLIT back trajectory analysis shows a wide spatial variability during the monsoon season. On the other hand, the origin of moisture during the WD season was mostly restricted from the Mediterranean region, providing an explanation of a strong dependency between the precipitation isotopes and the meteorological parameters during the WD period. Such kind of relation may provide additional diagnostic for the WD events and may help in paleo-monsoon investigations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aatmospheric precipitation 3ahydrology 3alatitude 3amoisture diffusivity 3amonsoon season 3arelative humidity 3atemperature 3aHimalayan region 3aIndia 3aMediterranean region 0aPrecipitation isotope 0aMonsoon 0aWestern disturbances 0aKashmir valley1 aAchyuthan, Hema1 aChakraborty, Supriyo1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3171-78081 aMetya, Abirlal1 aDatye, Amey1 aKripalani, R.H.1 aFousiya, A.A.0 tJournal of hydrology.g2020 Sept., v. 588 p.125106-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl46539x0022-16947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2020.1251063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03061naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100003100149245014300180500001900323520143100342592002801773650002801801650001401829650001401843650002201857650002201879650003001901650001801931650001101949650002301960650002701983650001302010650002402023650002302047651001002070651000902080653001902089653002202108653002002130653003002150653001902180700002102199700002502220700001902245700002102264700002102285773014402306856008402450852000902534655001202543IND60701876720221121145404.0200830e202009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070187672DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jembe.2020.1514322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQuintero-Galvis, Julian F.10aTemporal variation in the genetic diversity of a marine invertebrate with long larval phase, the muricid gastropod Concholepas concholepas  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aLarval dispersal affects population dynamics and thus the evolution of species; therefore, understanding how far planktonic larvae can move is key for the conservation and management of marine species. The degree to which genetic connectivity is temporally stable in marine environments is still largely unknown. Here we evaluated the temporal stability of the spatial genetic structure of the marine gastropod Concholepas concholepas, locally called the loco. This species has a wide geographic distribution along the southeastern Pacific, from Peru to southern Chile. The pelagic larval duration (PLD) of C. concholepas is three months. By comparing samples from eight spatially isolated sites in two different years (2006 and 2011), we analyzed the temporal and spatial variation of genetic diversity using 15 microsatellite loci. The results showed high levels of genetic diversity and high genetic differentiation between and within sample sites in both years. Our results suggest that there is temporal variation in gene flow direction probably drive it by oceanographic currents in the area and consequently larval dispersal at shorter distances might be expected. The Ne estimation suggests a complex demographic history and that inter-annual variability could affect the genetic structure in C. concholepas. This study highlights the importance of integrating temporal scales in the genetic studies of marine species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aConcholepas concholepas 3aevolution 3agene flow 3agenetic structure 3agenetic variation 3ageographical distribution 3ainvertebrates 3alarvae 3alarval development 3amicrosatellite repeats 3aplankton 3apopulation dynamics 3atemporal variation 3aChile 3aPeru 0aTemporal scale 0aGenetic diversity 0aMicrosatellites 0aEnvironmental variability 0aEffective size1 aBruning, Paulina1 aPaleo-López, Rocío1 aGomez, Daniela1 aSánchez, Roland1 aCárdenas, Leyla0 tJournal of experimental marine biology and ecology.g2020 Sept.,  Oct., v. 530-531 p.151432-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11705x0022-09817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jembe.2020.1514323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02843naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245011500165300001800280520121000298592002801508596005901536596005901595650001601654650001901670650001901689650001801708650001001726650002301736650001801759650001301777650001401790650001501804650002101819650001901840650002101859650002001880650002201900650002001922650002601942700001801968700001801986700001802004700001802022700001702040700005202057773012502109856008202234852000902316655001202325IND60752631920221123023150.0211005e202110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075263192DNAL7 a10.1007/s00344-020-10250-w2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLuo, Junling10aBnSIP1-1 Involves in Light Response and Regulation of Endogenous Hormones and Flowering Time of Brassica Napus  ap. 2049-2057.  aBnSIP1-1 is a trihelix transcription factor family gene which functions in abiotic stress response and abscisic acid (ABA) signaling during seed germination and seedling growth of Brassica napus. In the present study, further sequence analysis and phenotype identification indicated that this gene had roles in light regulation and flowering of reproductive growth stage. Many phytohormones responsive cis-acting elements, including TC-rich repeats, GARE-motif, and TCA and TGA elements, were identified in the promoter sequence of BnSIP1-1. The expression of BnSIP1-1 was regulated by light period and remarkable higher expression level of BnSIP1-1 was detected in roots than in leaves. Overexpression of BnSIP1-1 in Arabidopsis delayed flowering time for 3–5 days in transgenic plants. In addition, we also found BnSIP1-1 can respond to abiotic and ABA stress (treated with 200 mM NaCl, 300 mM mannitol or 50 μM ABA for 0, 1, 6, and 24 h) in B. napus through adjusting not only ABA but also other endogenous hormones, including indole-3-acetic acid and salicylic acid. Moreover, jasmonates (JA) signaling pathway was found not involving in the pathway of BnSIP1-1 responding to abiotic stresses.  aPublisher supplied data  a31201152cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a31671733cNational Natural Science Foundation of China 3aArabidopsis 3aBrassica napus 3aabiotic stress 3aabscisic acid 3agenes 3aindole acetic acid 3ajasmonic acid 3amannitol 3aphenotype 3aphotophase 3apromoter regions 3asalicylic acid 3aseed germination 3aseedling growth 3asequence analysis 3astress response 3atranscription factors1 aJiang, Weihua1 aTang, Shaohua1 aMei, Fengling1 aYan, Xiaohong1 aZeng, Xinhua1 aWu, Gang1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2523-03820 tJournal of plant growth regulation.g2021 Oct., v. 40, no. 5 p.2049-2057dSpringer USwJournal:jnl33237x0721-75957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00344-020-10250-w3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03296naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245013900170300001600309500001900325520164500344592002801989650004402017650001602061650001602077650001502093650002302108650002102131650001702152650003002169650001302199650001502212650002102227650001502248650002202263650002002285650001602305700001602321700005502337700005302392700005102445700005102496700005702547773011702604856008402721852000902805655001202814IND60725569620221118101749.0210126e20210107xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072556962DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.macromol.0c023892doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Chong-Min10aAlkali Metal Carboxylates: Simple and Versatile Initiators for Ring-Opening Alternating Copolymerization of Cyclic Anhydrides/Epoxides  ap. 713-724.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aIn this contribution, we thoroughly investigated the ring-opening alternating copolymerization (ROAC) of cyclic anhydride and epoxide by using commercially available alkali metal carboxylates (AMCs) as the simple and green initiators. The idea of our work is based on the coordination effects of epoxide on an AMC and the formation of AMC–epoxide adducts, which will weaken the interaction between metal cation and its carboxylate counterion and therefore render the carboxylate to feasibly attack epoxides in a nucleophilic manner at high temperature. The coordination effects of epoxide on the AMC could be proved by Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. AMCs could effectively catalyze the copolymerization of phthalate anhydride (PA) and cyclohexene oxide (CHO) in bulk at 110 °C, affording polyesters with perfectly alternating structure. Potassium acetate (KOAc) was able to copolymerize some common cyclic anhydrides and epoxide, allowing for the preparation of polyesters with structural diversity. Of note, KOAc could mediate ROAC of PA with propylene oxide (PO) with a high molar feed ratio of [KOAc]/[PA]/[PO] = 1:20 000:150 000, affording poly(PA-alt-PO) with high molecular weight (>100 kDa). Finally, two different polymerization mechanisms, including anionic polymerization and cooperative catalysis, have been proposed according to the interaction strength between metal cation and carboxylate anion. In the “cooperative catalysis” mechanism, the alkali metal cation served as the Lewis acid to activate epoxide and cyclic active species were generated.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aLewis acids 3aLewis bases 3aanhydrides 3acatalytic activity 3acopolymerization 3acyclohexenes 3adensity functional theory 3aepoxides 3ametal ions 3amolecular weight 3aphthalates 3apotassium acetate 3apropylene oxide 3atemperature1 aXu, Xiaowei1 aJi, He-Yuan1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1020-41221 aWang, Bin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3130-32291 aPan, Li1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9463-68561 aLuo, Yi1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6390-86391 aLi, Yue-Sheng1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4637-42540 tMacromolecules.g2021 Jan. 07, v. 54, no. 2 p.713-724dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23616x1520-58357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.macromol.0c023893Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02969naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245010000168300001600268520130500284592002801589650001901617650001401636650001101650650001401661650001101675650002101686650002401707650000901731650002401740650002701764650001101791650002801802650001501830650001701845650001701862650001301879650001501892651001001907651001801917653001901935653002801954653002701982653001502009653002102024653001402045653001702059653001702076700001302093700001702106700001602123700001802139700001802157773009802175856008502273852000902358655001202367IND60560391220221120224118.0190318e201704  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056039122DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cropro.2016.11.0352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZheng, Huixin10aDynamic monitoring (B versus Q) and further resistance status of Q-type Bemisia tabaci in China  ap. 115-122.  aBemisia tabaci (Gennadius) (Hemiptera: Aleyrodidae) causes serious economic losses in many countries and has developed substantial resistance to commonly used insecticides. To determine whether the ratio of B. tabaci B to B. tabaci Q has continued to change in China, we collected specimens in 2013 and 2014 from most provinces in the country. Resistance to insecticides was also assessed in Q-type B. tabaci. B. tabaci Q remained much more abundant than B. tabaci B throughout China in 2013 and 2014, representing 82% of the specimens in 2013 and 88% in 2014. B. tabaci B was mainly found in the southeast coast and Yangtze river basin. Abamectin remained highly toxic to B. tabaci adults, with LC50 values <0.2 mg/l in 2013 and 2014. Thiamethoxam showed lower toxicity to HN and HB strains, with LC50 values >500 mg/l in 2014. Although cyantraniliprole also remained highly toxic to pre-adults of B. tabaci, the resistance ratio (relative to the sensitive Lab-Q strain) increased to 27.80 for eggs and to 35.79 for larvae. B. tabaci Q continues to dominate in China. As of 2014, abamectin, cyantraniliprole, and pyriproxyfen were still effective against B. tabaci based on our laboratory bioassays but moderate resistance to cyantraniliprole and pyriproxyfen was detected in some areas.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBemisia tabaci 3aabamectin 3aadults 3abioassays 3acoasts 3acyantraniliprole 3adeveloped countries 3aeggs 3afinancial economics 3ainsecticide resistance 3alarvae 3alethal concentration 50 3amonitoring 3apyriproxyfen 3athiamethoxam 3atoxicity 3awatersheds 3aChina 3aYangtze River 0aBemisia tabaci 0aB and Q cryptic species 0aInsecticide resistance 0aResistance 0aCyantraniliprole 0aAbamectin 0aPyriproxyfen 0aThiamethoxam1 aXie, Wen1 aWang, Shaoli1 aWu, Qingjun1 aZhou, Xiaomao1 aZhang, Youjun0 tCrop protection.g2017 Apr., v. 94 p.115-122dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl34114x0261-21947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cropro.2016.11.0353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02724naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100003000152245008900182300001600271500002800287520147600315650001001791650001601801650001601817653000801833653000901841653001601850700001601866700001701882700002001899700002001919700001601939700002001955700001801975700001701993700001702010700002302027700001802050773011002068852000902178856009202187946001102279655001202290IND4404253820221121062800.0080412s2008    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440425382DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-313X.2008.03401.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChang, Chiung-swey Joanne10aLZF1, a HY5-regulated transcriptional factor, functions in Arabidopsis de-etiolation  ap. 205-219.  aPublisher supplied data  aWe surveyed differential gene expression patterns during early photomorphogenesis in both wild-type and mutant Arabidopsis defective in HY5, an influential positive regulator of the responses of gene expression to a light stimulus, to identify light-responsive genes whose expression was HY5 dependent. These gene-expression data identified light-regulated zinc finger protein 1 (LZF1), a gene encoding a previously uncharacterized C2C2-CO B-box transcriptional regulator. HY5 has positive trans-activating activity toward LZF1 and binding affinity to LZF1 promoter in vivo. HY5 is needed but not sufficient for the induction of LZF1 expression. Anthocyanin content is significantly diminished in lzf1 under far red, which is the most efficient light for the induction of LZF1. The expression of PAP1/MYB75 is elevated in plants overexpressing LZF1, which leads to the hyperaccumulation of anthocyanin in transgenic Arabidopsis. The transition from etioplast to chloroplast and the accumulation of chlorophyll were notably compromised in the lzf1 mutant. We provide molecular evidence that LZF1 influences chloroplast biogenesis and function via regulating genes encoding chloroplast proteins. In the absence of HY5, mutation of LZF1 leads to further reduced light sensitivity for light-regulated inhibition of hypocotyl elongation and anthocyanin and chlorophyll accumulation. Our data indicate that LZF1 is a positive regulator functioning in Arabidopsis de-etiolation. 3alight 3achlorophyll 3aArabidopsis 0aHY5 0aLZF1 0aanthocyanin1 aLi, Yi-Hang1 aChen, Li-Teh1 aChen, Wan-Chieh1 aHsieh, Wen-Ping1 aShin, Jieun1 aJane, Wann-Neng1 aChou, Shu-Jen1 aChoi, Giltsu1 aHu, Jer-Ming1 aSomerville, Shauna1 aWu, Shu-Hsing0 tPlant journal.g2008 Apr., v. 54, no. 2 p.205-219dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0960-74127nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-313X.2008.03401.x3Available from publisher's Web site  aNon-US 7aarticle02323naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001700145245007900162300001600241520110800257650003001365650001601395650000901411650001101420650001301431650002901444650001601473653000801489653001201497653000801509653001501517700002001532700001701552700001701569700002101586700001901607773013701626852000901763856008501772930003301857946001101890655001201901IND4404955320221121062958.0080425e200806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440495532DNAL7 a10.1007/s11274-007-9547-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHa, Suk-Jin 10aLactate increases coenzyme Q₁₀ production by Agrobacterium tumefaciens  ap. 887-890.  aBy the optimization of nitrogen source for coenzyme Q₁₀ (ubiquinone, CoQ₁₀) production in Agrobacterium tumefaciens KCCM 10413 culture, the highest CoQ₁₀ production was achieved in medium containing corn steep powder (CSP). Components for a stimulatory effect on the production of CoQ₁₀ in CSP were screened, and lactate was found to increase dry cell weight (DCW) and the specific CoQ₁₀ content. In a fed-batch culture of A. tumefaciens, supplementation with 1.5 g of lactate l⁻¹ further improved DCW, the specific CoQ₁₀ content, and CoQ₁₀ production by 16.0, 5.8, and 22.8%, respectively. It has been reported that lactate stimulates cell growth and acts as an accelerator driving the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle (Roberto et al. 2002, Biotechnol Let 24:427-431; Matsuoka et al. 1996, Biosci Biotechnol Biochem 60:575-579). In this study, lactate supplementation increased DCW and the specific CoQ₁₀ content in A. tumefaciens culture, probably by accelerating TCA cycle and energy production as reported previously, leading to the increase of CoQ₁₀ production. 3aAgrobacterium radiobacter 3acell growth 3acorn 3aenergy 3anitrogen 3atricarboxylic acid cycle 3aubiquinones 0aCSP 0aLactate 0aATP 0aUbiquinone1 aKim, Sang-yong.1 aSeo, Jin-Ho 1 aSim, Won-Il 1 aMun, Hŭi-jŏng.1 aLee, Jung-Kul 0 tWorld journal of microbiology & biotechnology.g2008 June, v. 24, no. 6 p.887-890dDordrecht : Springer Netherlandsx0959-39937nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11274-007-9547-83Available from publisher's Web site  a20080425b20080502c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03914naa a2200673 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100002200171245009700193300001600290520178900306650001602095650001502111650002302126650001302149650001702162650001202179650001202191650002602203650001702229650002002246650001602266650001702282650003002299650002102329650001102350650001402361650001902375650002002394650004102414650004802455650005002503650005302553650004702606650002402653650001402677650004302691650004002734650003302774650002502807653001302832653001002845653002102855653000902876700001702885700001902902700002302921700001702944773012202961852000903083856009203092930003303184946001103217655001203228IND4403927920221121062955.0080404e200805  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440392792DNAL7 a182821742pmid7 a10.1111/j.1467-7652.2008.00325.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSuzuki, Yoshihito10aImmunomodulation of bioactive gibberellin confers gibberellin-deficient phenotypes in plants  ap. 355-367.  aImmunomodulation is a means to modulate an organism's function by antibody production to capture either endogenous or exogenous antigens. This method was applied to plants to repress the function of gibberellins (GAs), a class of phytohormones responsible for plant elongation, by anti-bioactive GA antibodies. Two different antibodies were produced in Arabidopsis as single-chain variable fragment (scFv) fused to green fluorescent protein (GFP) with four different subcellular localizations: endoplasmic reticulum (ER), cytosol, apoplastic space or the outer surface of the plasma membrane. When targeting scFv-GFP to ER, plants showed the highest accumulation of scFv-GFP, with binding activity, strong GFP fluorescence in ER-derived compartments and mild but clear GA-deficient phenotypes, including a smaller leaf size, delayed bolting, shorter inflorescence length and decreased germination. Plants expressing scFv-GFP in ER responded to exogenous GA₄ and contained 15-40 times greater endogenous GA₄ than wild-type plants. They also showed increased gene expression for GA3ox1, GA20ox1 and GA20ox2, but decreased expression for GA2ox1, which are feedback and feedforward regulated by GA signalling, respectively. These results suggest that the level of free functional GA₄ decreased when trapped in the ER with scFv to the extent that mild GA-deficient phenotypes were created. A dramatic increase in the total sum of GA₄ (free plus scFv-GFP bound) was detected as a result of the up-regulation of GA biosynthesis (feedback regulated), and a decrease in GA₄ catabolism as a result of protection by scFv-GFP binding. This study demonstrates that the use of immunomodulation to inhibit the action of bioactive GAs is an effective method of creating GA-deficient plants. 3aArabidopsis 3aantibodies 3aantibody formation 3aantigens 3abiosynthesis 3abolting 3acytosol 3aendoplasmic reticulum 3afluorescence 3agene expression 3agermination 3agibberellins 3agreen fluorescent protein 3aimmunomodulation 3aleaves 3aphenotype 3aplant hormones 3aplasma membrane 2aArabidopsisximmunologyxmetabolism. 2aArabidopsis Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plantximmunology 2aGibberellinsxchemistryximmunologyxmetabolism. 2aImmunoglobulin Variable Regionximmunology 2aMolecular Structure 2aPhenotype 2aPlant Epidermisxcytologyxmetabolism. 2aPlant Leavesxcytologyxmetabolism. 2aPlants, Genetically Modified 2aRecombinant Proteins 0aantibody 0adwarf 0aimmunomodulation 0ascFv1 aMizuno, Toru1 aUrakami, Eriko1 aYamaguchi, Isomaro1 aAsami, Tadao0 tPlant biotechnology journal.g2008 May, v. 6, no. 4 p.355-367dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx1467-76447nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-7652.2008.00325.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20080404b20080502c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02906naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002200152245011600174300001600290500001500306520130100321650002101622650001701643650000901660650002801669650004101697650002101738650001701759650002901776650003101805650002601836650001601862650001001878650001601888650002001904650001601924653002901940653004101969653001702010700001602027700001902043700002002062700001502082700001902097773012702116852000902243856009202252930003302344946001102377655001202388IND4406739520221121062948.0080613e200807  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440673952DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1439-0418.2008.01278.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSaravanakumar, D.10aPseudomonas fluorescens enhances resistance and natural enemy population in rice plants against leaffolder pest  ap. 469-479.  a2019-12-04  aPlant growth promoting fluorescent pseudomonad strains Pf1, TDK1 and PY15 were evaluated for their efficacy against leaffolder (Cnaphalocrocis medinalis) pest in rice plants under field conditions individually and in combinations. Application of mixtures of Pseudomonas fluorescens strains Pf1, TDK1 and PY15 significantly reduced the leaffolder damage in rice plants compared with untreated control. Interestingly, natural enemy population in plots treated with P. fluorescens was greater than the chemical and untreated controls. Further, support for these results was gathered by assaying activities of polyphenol oxidase (PPO) and lipoxygenase (LOX) under glasshouse conditions. The results showed the higher activity of PPO and LOX in plants treated with P. fluorescens mixtures (Pf1 + TDK1 + PY15) than the plants treated with individual strains, chemical and untreated controls. Further, fluorescent pseudomonad mixtures increased the rice yield compared with individual strain and non-bacterized treatments. The present study reveals that in addition to plant growth promotion, plant growth-promoting rhizobacterial (PGPR) strains-mediated induction of PPO and LOX in rice plants could be involved in enhanced natural enemy populations and resistance mechanisms against leaffolder attack. 3agrowth promotion 3aplant growth 3arice 3aPseudomonas fluorescens 3aplant growth-promoting rhizobacteria 3acatechol oxidase 3afluorescence 3aCnaphalocrocis medinalis 3alinoleate 13S-lipoxygenase 3aresistance mechanisms 3agrain yield 3apests 3aleafrollers 3anatural enemies 3agreenhouses 0anatural enemy population 0aplant growth promoting rhizobacteria 0alipoxygenase1 aLavanya, N.1 aMuthumeena, B.1 aRaguchander, T.1 aSuresh, S.1 aSamiyappan, R.0 tJournal of applied entomology.g2008 July, v. 132, no. 6 p.469-479dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0931-20487nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1439-0418.2008.01278.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20080613b20080704c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle04114naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001800152245011600170300001600286520247900302650001202781650001202793650002102805650002502826650001402851650002002865650001202885650000902897650001202906650000802918650001202926650001402938650001502952650000902967650001002976650001002986650001202996650003003008650001203038651001503050651001803065653002303083653001803106653000903124653002303133653002103156653002903177700001803206700002203224700001303246773012003259852000903379856009203388930003303480946001103513655001203524IND4400251620221121063031.0080120e200802  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440025162DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2699.2007.01780.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVergani, D.F.14aThe effects of El Niño-La Niña on reproductive parameters of elephant seals feeding in the Bellingshausen Sea  ap. 248-256.  aTo assess the impacts of El Niño-La Niña events on the pup weaning mass and diet of female southern elephant seals (Mirounga leonina) feeding in the Bellingshausen Sea, Antarctica, and to understand the ecological processes that drive these impacts. Atlantic southern elephant seal weaning mass and diet were measured at King George Island (62[ordinal indicator, masculine]14' S, 58[ordinal indicator, masculine]30' W). Feeding areas for pregnant female seals from King George Island are located west of Alexander Island in the Bellingshausen Sea. Data on weaning mass were collected between 1985 and 1994 during the breeding season (September-November). Moulting females were anaesthetized and cephalopod beaks were isolated and identified from stomach contents obtained from stomach lavages. Sea-surface temperature anomaly (SSTA) data for the 'El Niño 3.4' geographical region (5[ordinal indicator, masculine] N-5[ordinal indicator, masculine] S, 120[ordinal indicator, masculine] W-170[ordinal indicator, masculine] W) were used to define El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) event years (grouped as El Niño, La Niña and Neutral) as well as the strength of each ENSO event year. Using data from the US National Center for Environmental Prediction, temperature, sea ice concentration and atmospheric pressure anomalies in the Bellingshausen Sea were calculated from March to August, corresponding to the feeding period of pregnant female seals. Positive temperature anomalies and negative pressure anomalies in the Bellingshausen Sea were observed during La Niña years and negative temperature anomalies and positive pressure anomalies during El Niño years. These data correlate with sea ice concentration anomalies, which are highly negative during La Niña years and highly positive during El Niño years. Warm temperature conditions in the Bellingshausen Sea during La Niña years are strongly related to both higher weaning mass in elephant seals and to an increase in squid beaks in the stomach contents of females. It is possible that higher elephant seal weaning masses in La Niña years correlate with warmer waters in the Bellingshausen Sea leading to the rapid growth of squid and their more frequent descents to depths frequented by elephant seals. This results in increased predation by pregnant females, leading to a greater mass among weaned pups. This hypothesis may guide future research about interactions between climate and the marine biosphere. 3aEl Nino 3aLa Nina 3aMirounga leonina 3aatmospheric pressure 3abiosphere 3abreeding season 3aclimate 3adiet 3afemales 3aice 3amolting 3apredation 3aprediction 3apups 3aseals 3asquid 3astomach 3asurface water temperature 3aweaning 3aAntarctica 3aUnited States 0aBellingshausen Sea 0aelephant seal 0aENSO 0aKing George Island 0aMirounga leonina 0aPsychroteuthis glacialis1 aLabraga, J.C.1 aStanganelli, Z.B.1 aDunn, M.0 tJournal of biogeography.g2008 Feb., v. 35, no. 2 p.248-256dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0305-02707nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2699.2007.01780.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20080120b20080202c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03375naa a2200673 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100001400171245009900185300001600284520128000300650002301580650002801603650004101631650002101672650002201693650001701715650000901732650001001741650002601751650001401777650001901791650001001810650001601820650002101836650001201857650001701869650002701886650006001913650003701973650002202010650004102032650003002073650002002103650003302123650001302156650001102169650001502180650002902195650003302224650002702257653002402284653003002308653001102338653001302349700001802362700001602380700001902396773012902415852000902544856009202553930003302645946001102678655001202689IND4406439720221121051102.0080606e200807  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440643972DNAL7 a182844882pmid7 a10.1111/j.1365-2672.2008.03741.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBluma, R.10aControl of Aspergillus section Flavi growth and aflatoxin accumulation by plant essential oils  ap. 203-214.  aThe antifungal effect of Pimpinella anisum (anise), Pëumus boldus (boldus), Mentha piperita (peppermint), Origanum vulgare (oregano) and Minthosthachys verticillata (peperina) essential oils against Aspergillus section Flavi (two isolates of Aspergillus parasiticus and two isolates of Aspergillus flavus) was evaluated in maize meal extract agar at 0·982 and 0·955 water activities, at 25°C. The percentage of germination, germ-tube elongation rate, growth rate and aflatoxin B₁ (AFB₁) accumulation at different essential oils concentrations were evaluated. Anise and boldus essential oils were the most inhibitory at 500 mg kg⁻¹ to all growth parameters of the fungus. These essential oils inhibited the percentage of germination, germ-tube elongation rate and fungal growth. AFB₁ accumulation was completely inhibited by anise, boldus and oregano essential oils. Peperina and peppermint essential oils inhibited AFB₁ production by 85-90% in all concentrations assayed. Anise and boldus essential oils could be considered as effective fungitoxicans for Aspergillus section flavi.

Over this 10-year period there was a small decline in diarrhea prevalence but treatment with oral rehydration therapy (ORT) increased greatly. Deaths due to dehydration were thus averted, although the costly burden of morbidity remained high. The decline in diarrhea prevalence was largely due to changes in the effects of several key covariates, such as breastfeeding, with only a modest role played by socioeconomic change, infrastructure improvements, and other behavioral factors. ORT treatment of diarrhea was essentially unrelated to child and family characteristics, suggesting that the large increase was due to the success of public health efforts to promote its use widely. Our results suggest that the most effective policies for reducing diarrhea prevalence are likely to be further increases in education and the promotion of breastfeeding. Persistent disparities in diarrhea prevalence mean that policies to prevent the disease should be targeted at disadvantaged socioeconomic groups. 3adiarrhea 3aBrazil 0aChild health 0aORT treatment1 aBurgard, Sarah 0 tPopulation research and policy review.g2011 Feb., v. 30, no. 1 p.81-100dDordrecht : Springer Netherlandsx0167-59237nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11113-010-9179-93Available from publisher's Web site  a20110114b20110205c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03317naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002000145245009200165300001600257520216100273650001302434650002502447653004602472653004302518653004102561653002702602700002302629700001802652700002202670700001902692773011802711852000902829856008502838930003302923946001102956655001202967IND4446820020221121051026.0101224e201101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444682002DNAL7 a10.1007/s11010-010-0629-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAkkız, Hikmet 10aFunctional polymorphisms of cyclooxygenase-2 gene and risk for hepatocellular carcinoma  ap. 201-208.  aCyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) influences carcinogenesis through immune response suppression, apoptosis inhibition, regulation of angiogenesis and tumor cell invasion, and metastasis. It is now well established that COX-2 is overexpressed in many premalignant, malignant, and metastatic cancers, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). DNA sequence variations in the COX-2 gene may lead to altered COX-2 production and/or activity, and so they cause inter-individual differences in the susceptibility to HCC. Functional coding region polymorphisms −1195A>G (rs689466), −765G>C (rs20417), and +8473T>C (rs5275) in the COX-2 gene have recently been shown to be associated with several human cancers but their association with HCC has yet to be investigated. We used hospital-based case-control study to assess the hypothesis that the functional COX-2 variation may affect individual susceptibility to the HCC. COX-2 polymorphisms were investigated in 129 confirmed subjects with HCC and 129 cancer-free control subjects matched on age, gender, smoking, and alcohol consumption using a polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) assay. The distribution of the COX-2 −1195A>G and +8473T>C genotypes were not significantly different between HCC cases and control. However, proportion of the COX-2 −765CC genotype which leads to a 30% reduction of the COX-2 promoter activity was significantly lower in patients with HCC (3.1%) when compared to control subjects (11.6%) (P < 0.05). Logistic regression analyses revealed that the COX-2 −765G>C variant genotype (−765CC) was associated with a significantly decreased risk of HCC compared with the −765GG wild-type homozygotes [P < 0.05, odds ratio (OR) = 0.25, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.08-0.79]. Our results suggest for the first time that the −765CC genotype of COX-2 −765G>C polymorphism, causing lower COX-2 gen expression, is a genetic protective factor for HCC. However, because this is the first report concerning the COX-2 −1195A>G, −765G>C, and +8473T>C polymorphisms and the risk of HCC, independent studies are needed to validate our findings. 3ahepatoma 3acase-control studies 0aCOX-2 −1195 A>G (rs689466) polymorphism 0aCOX-2 −765G>C (rs20417) polymorphism 0aCOX-2 +8473T>C (rs5275) polymorphism 0aGenetic susceptibility1 aBayram, Süleyman 1 aBekar, Aynur 1 aAkgöllü, Ersin 1 aÜlger, Yakup 0 tMolecular and cellular biochemistry.g2011 Jan., v. 347, no. 1-2 p.201-208dBoston : Springer USx0300-81777nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11010-010-0629-93Available from publisher's Web site  a20101224b20110101c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02399naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002500145245013000170300001400300520136800314650001701682650002801699653001201727653001601739700002501755700002101780700003001801773011601831852000901947856008501956939003302041946001102074655001202085IND4449575320221121051031.0110225e201103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444957532DNAL7 a10.1007/s11010-010-0655-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRajendra Prasad, N. 10aInhibitory effect of caffeic acid on cancer cell proliferation by oxidative mechanism in human HT-1080 fibrosarcoma cell line  ap. 11-19.  aCaffeic acid (3,4-dihydroxy cinnamic acid) (CA) is naturally found in fruits, vegetables, olive oil, and coffee.

To understand the mode of antiproliferative effect of CA, the authors observed intracellular ROS levels by DCFH-DA method, mitochondrial membrane potential alterations by Rh-123 staining, oxidative DNA damage by comet assay, and apoptotic morphological changes by AO/EtBr-staining method. The results show that caffeic acid enhances lipid peroxidative markers such as TBARS, CD, and LHP in HT-1080 cell line. Caffeic acid enhances the ROS levels, which is evidenced by the increased DCF fluorescence. Further, caffeic acid treatment altered the mitochondrial membrane potential in HT-1080 cells. Similarly, the authors observed increased oxidative DNA damage (% Tail DNA, % Tail length, Tail moment, and olive tail moment), and apoptotic morphological changes in caffeic acid-treated groups. These data suggest that caffeic acid exhibits potent anticancer effect in HT-1080 cell line, and that it may be used as an anticancer agent. 3acaffeic acid 3areactive oxygen species 0aHT-1080 0aProoxidants1 aKārttikēyan̲, Ā.1 aKarthikeyan, S. 1 aVenkata Reddy, Bandugula 0 tMolecular and cellular biochemistry.g2011 Mar., v. 349, no. 1-2 p.11-19dBoston : Springer USx0300-81777nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11010-010-0655-73Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b20110305c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03037naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100003100164245013700195300001600332520133700348650000801685650002201693650001301715650002301728650001101751650002201762650002101784650001101805650000901816650002401825650003301849650003501882650003001917650004601947650004901993650001802042650003102060650001702091653001502108653001902123700002602142700002002168700002302188700002202211773013502233852000902368856008602377930003302463946001102496655001202507IND4391169520221121051050.0070506e200609  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439116952DNAL7 a168687312pmid7 a10.1007/s00216-006-0575-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMueller-Spitz, Sabrina R. 10aUse of SEC-ICP-MS with a collision cell for determining the interaction of chromium with DNA extracted from metal-contaminated soils  ap. 142-151.  aThe potential of chromium to bind to DNA isolated directly from soil microbial communities was investigated in this study. An analytical scheme was developed to distinguish between chromium bound to DNA and its fragments or chromium contained elsewhere in an environmental DNA extract. DNA was extracted from chromium-contaminated soils and purified using DNA clean-up resins. Size-exclusion chromatography was employed due to its advantages in the separation and molecular weight approximation of large biomolecules. It was coupled with two on-line detection systems (spectrophotometric and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometric) to study the binding of chromium to DNA or other components in a DNA extract. A collision cell was pressurized with helium to remove diatomic and polyatomic interferents resulting from the chosen mobile phase. Chromium peaks were observed in both the large and small molecular weight regions of the chromatogram; to further confirm that the environmentally extracted DNA contained Cr, the subsequently purified DNA was examined for total Cr using flow injection ICP-MS to accommodate small sample volumes. DNA samples isolated from the two soils examined contained 0.5-0.7 ppb Cr, indicating that DNA isolated directly from a chromium-contaminated soil has chromium bound to the nucleic acids. 3aDNA 3aDNA fragmentation 3achromium 3agel chromatography 3ahelium 3amass spectrometry 3amolecular weight 3aresins 3asoil 3asoil microorganisms 2aChromatography, Gelxmethods 2aChromiumxanalysisxchemistry. 2aDNAxanalysisxchemistry. 2aEnvironmental Monitoringxinstrumentation 2aMass Spectrometryxinstrumentationxmethods. 2aParticle Size 2aSoil Pollutantsxchemistry 2aTime Factors 0aSEC-ICP-MS 0aCollision cell1 aVonderheide, Anne P. 1 aShann, Jodi R. 1 aCaruso, Joseph A. 1 aKinkle, Brian K. 0 tAnalytical and bioanalytical chemistry.g2006 Sept., v. 386, no. 1 p.142-151dBerlin/Heidelberg : Springer-Verlagx1618-26427nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00216-006-0575-23Available from publisher's Web site.  a20070507b20070602c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02720naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001700152245008100169300001800250500002800268520170500296650001702001650001402018653002702032653000902059653002602068700001802094700002202112700001802134773013002152852000902282856009202291946001102383655001202394IND4411599820221121000749.0081017s2008    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441159982DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1463-1326.2008.00867.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRankin, J.W.10aEffect of raisin consumption on oxidative stress and inflammation in obesity  ap. 1086-1096.  aPublisher supplied data  aOxidative stress can initiate increased inflammation that elevates risk for cardiovascular disease. The objective of this study was to determine the effects of daily consumption of raisins on markers of oxidative stress, inflammation and endothelial activation in response to an acute high-fat meal in overweight individuals. Seventeen overweight men and women consumed 90 g raisins or isocaloric placebo (264 kcal/day) for 14 days in a randomized, crossover design while following a low-flavonoid diet. The oxidative [urinary 8-iso-prostaglandin-F₂α (8-epi PGF₂α) and serum oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC)], inflammatory (serum C-reactive protein and interleukin-6), endothelial (serum soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1 and soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule-1, sVCAM-1) and metabolic [free fatty acids (FFAs), triacylglycerol, glucose and insulin] response to four high-fat (53%) meals was tested pre- and postintervention. Urinary 8-epi PGF₂α decreased (-22%) and fasting ORAC increased (+3%) after both interventions combined. Fasting protein-free ORAC was modestly (+3.5%) higher during the raisin than the placebo intervention. Neither the meals nor the raisins consistently induced fasted markers of inflammation or endothelial dysfunction. Gender influenced postprandial metabolic responses in that males responded with higher serum FFAs, sVCAM-1 and glucose compared with females. Serum antioxidant capacity was modestly increased by daily raisin consumption, but this did not alter fasted or postprandial inflammatory response in these relatively healthy but overweight individuals. Providing all food in regular pattern reduced measures of oxidative stress. 3aantioxidants 3acytokines 0aendothelial activation 0aORAC 0apostprandial response1 aAndreae, M.C.1 aOliver Chen, C.-Y1 aO'Keefe, S.F.0 tDiabetes, obesity & metabolism.g2008 Nov., v. 10, no. 11 p.1086-1096dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx1462-89027nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1463-1326.2008.00867.x3Available from publisher's Web site  aNon-US 7aarticle03467naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002900145245015000174300001800324520196000342650001202302650001702314650001202331650001102343650001702354650000902371650001102380650001902391650001902410650001302429650001602442650001102458650001802469650001902487650001802506650001802524653000802542653001902550653001802569653002602587700002402613700002302637700002502660773013802685852000902823856008502832930003302917946001102950655001202961IND4398554520221121000520.0071209e200712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439855452DNAL7 a10.1007/s00216-007-1628-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKovaříková, Vladěna 10aUse of the diffusive gradients in thin films technique (DGT) with various diffusive gels for characterization of sewage sludge-contaminated soils  ap. 2303-2311.  aThe diffusive gradients in thin film technique (DGT) was used for characterization of South Moravian arable soils (sampling sites Zlín, Tuřany, and Chrlice) amended by sewage sludge in the 1980s. Two types of polyacrylamide diffusive gel with different pore size (APA gels--cross-linked with agarose and RG gels--cross-linked with bis-acrylamide) were employed. The (bio)available parts of Cd, Cu, and Ni and the proportions of inorganically and organically complexed species of these metals were assessed. The degree of metal resupply from the soil solid phase to the soil solution was also determined. Metal concentrations obtained by the DGT technique were lower by almost 4 to 5 orders of magnitude in comparison with those obtained by extraction with aqua regia. DGT concentrations of metals were also lower by approximately 1 to 2 orders of magnitude in comparison with those obtained by extraction with sodium nitrate (commonly used for assessment of the (bio)available part of metals). Results obtained by DGT measurement were expected to be closer to the actual content of available metal species than results obtained by extraction with sodium nitrate. Using RG gels together with APA gels provided resolution of inorganically and organically complexed metal species and their proportional representation. Inorganic metal species (particles smaller than 1 nm) formed a predominant part of assessed metal content in all studied soil samples and horizons. However, there was the exception of the cadmium content in the middle profile of Chrlice sandy soil sample. Ratio R values indicated that resupply of Cd, Cu, and Ni from the solid phase to the soil solution varied for individual soil samples and individual depth profiles. Mobile and labile species of Cd, Cu, and Ni were much more closely related to upper rather than deeper horizons. This observation correlates very well with the mechanical treatment and amendment of the studied soils. 3aagarose 3aarable soils 3acadmium 3acopper 3acrosslinking 3agels 3anickel 3apolluted soils 3apolyacrylamide 3aporosity 3asandy soils 3asewage 3asewage sludge 3asodium nitrate 3asoil sampling 3asoil solution 0aDGT 0aDiffusive gels 0aMetal species 0aExtraction procedures1 aDočekalová, Hana 1 aDočekal, Bohumil 1 aPodborská, Martina 0 tAnalytical and bioanalytical chemistry.g2007 Dec., v. 389, no. 7-8 p.2303-2311dBerlin/Heidelberg : Springer-Verlagx1618-26427nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00216-007-1628-x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20071209b20080102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02351naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001800164245008900182300001600271520074100287650001801028650002501046650001901071650001901090650001301109650004101122650002401163650002901187650003601216650002401252650003101276650004501307650002801352650003501380650002401415650006001439650002401499653003001523653001201553700003201565773013401597852000901731856008501740930003301825946001101858655001201869IND4395292120221120215400.0070923e200710  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439529212DNAL7 a177014012pmid7 a10.1007/s00216-007-1492-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDayon, Loïc 10aDiagonal chromatographic selection of cysteinyl peptides modified with benzoquinones  ap. 841-849.  aThe derivatization of cysteine-containing peptides with benzoquinone compounds is rapid, quantitative and specific in acidic media.

These results have stimulated plans to introduce mass screening in various countries; however, none of these trials has been able to show any reduction of total mortality, which should be expected with reduced disease-specific mortality in a RCT. Methods The aim of this review is to analyse, in more detail, the findings in these trials. The results of the trials have, in this review, been systematised and discussed in the context of potential bias, validity and effectiveness. Results It is found that the reduced cancer-specific mortality is modest and that the clinical significance may be discussed. The number of persons needed to be invited for multiple screening rounds to avoid one death in colorectal cancer (CRC) is high, ranging from about 600 to 1,200. A remarkable finding is that only one fourth of the carcinomas in those invited to the screening were actually detected by this intervention. The absence of reduced total mortality in all series is a serious problem and evokes questions about the validity in determination of cause of death. None of these trials showed any effect on incidence of CRC by removal of precancerous adenomas. Conclusions It seems reasonable to conclude that the scientific evidence to support introduction of population-based screening programmes with FOBT appears not yet strong enough. In addition, harm/benefit and cost/effectiveness ratios are not well determined. 3acolorectal neoplasms 3ascreening 3amortality 3abias 2aClinical Trials as Topic 2aColorectal Neoplasmsxbloodxdiagnosis. 2aDiagnostic Tests, Routinexmethods 2aHumans 2aMass Screeningxmethods 2aOccult Blood 2aReproducibility of Results 0aBowel cancer1 aManjer, Jonas 1 aZackrisson, Sophia 0 tInternational journal of colorectal disease.g2010 Nov., v. 25, no. 11 p.1269-1275dBerlin/Heidelberg : Springer-Verlagx0179-19587nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00384-010-1027-13Available from publisher's Web site  a20101001b20101001c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01400naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002800092040001800120100001800138245006900156300001400225500001500239520018200254592002800436650002700464650001800491650001400509650001700523650003000540650002200570650001300592650001800605650002200623650001100645653002500656653001600681653003000697773010500727852000900832856007800841930003300919945001300952946001300965655001200978IND2057248620221120193855.0970521e199703  gau|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205724862DNAL7 a10.1007/BF027721092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aToki, Seiichi10aRapid and efficientAgrobacterium-mediated transformation in rice  ap. 16-21.  a2019-12-04  aAn improved protocol forAgrobacterium-mediated transformation of rice is described.

The applicability and sensitivity of different plutonium isotope ratios, ²⁴⁰Pu/²³⁹Pu and ²⁴¹Pu/²³⁹Pu measured by inductively coupled plasma sector field mass spectrometry and ²³⁸Pu/²³⁹Pu analysed by alpha spectrometry, have been evaluated for origin determination in several types of environmental samples. With use of mixing models the contribution of different sources (e.g. global fallout or Chernobyl) can be calculated. By the measurement of the ²⁴¹Am/²⁴¹Pu isotope ratio, the release date (i.e. formation of ²⁴¹Pu by irradiation) can be estimated in environmental samples, which is an important parameter to distinguish recent plutonium release from previous (e.g. Chernobyl) emissions. 3aamericium 3aemissions 3aenvironmental assessment 3airradiation 3aisotopes 3amass spectrometry 3amixing 3aplutonium 3astatistical models 2aAlgorithms 2aAmericiumxanalysis 2aEnvironmental Monitoring 2aEpidemiological Monitoring 2aMass Spectrometry 2aPlutoniumxanalysis 2aRadioactive Falloutxanalysis 2aRadioactive Hazard Release 0aUkrainexepidemiology. 0aIsotope ratio measurement 0aOrigin 0aDate assessment0 tAnalytical and bioanalytical chemistry.g2007 Oct., v. 389, no. 3 p.725-732dBerlin/Heidelberg : Springer-Verlagx1618-26427nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00216-007-1371-33Available from publisher's Web site  a20070923b20071002c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02061naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002200164245013400186300001600320520065900336650002000995650001201015650001001027650001801037650001301055650001201068650001001080650002601090650002201116650001001138650001901148650000901167653002401176653001901200653001301219653001301232700003401245700002101279700001801300773013401318852000901452856008601461930003301547946001101580655001201591IND4391135720221120111149.0070506e200602  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439113572DNAL7 a164021732pmid7 a10.1007/s00216-005-0259-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchäfer, Thomas.10aPervaporation membrane separation process for enhancing the selectivity of an artificial olfactory system (“electronic nose”)  ap. 860-866.  aThis study investigates the potential of pervaporation (a selective membrane separation technique) combined with an electronic nose based on metal oxide sensors for analyzing wine model solutions.

Simulations of the composition of the permeate demonstrate that, despite the low molecular density of the permeate, the respective solute concentrations are sufficiently high to generate a reproducible and significant response from the metal oxide sensors. 3aelectronic nose 3aethanol 3aodors 3apervaporation 3apolymers 3asolutes 3awines 2aMembranes, Artificial 2aOxidesxchemistry 2aSmell 2aVolatilization 2aWine 0aWine model solution 0aSample work-up 0aMembrane 0aAnalysis1 aSerrano-Santos, Maria Belén 1 aRocchi, Santina 1 aFuoco, Roger 0 tAnalytical and bioanalytical chemistry.g2006 Feb., v. 384, no. 4 p.860-866dBerlin/Heidelberg : Springer-Verlagx1618-26427nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00216-005-0259-33Available from publisher's Web site.  a20070507b20070602c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02173naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100001700171245006500188300001600253520087400269650001301143650000901156650001301165650001201178650000901190650001201199650001601211650002101227650001101248650002401259650001501283650001701298650001601315653001301331653002801344700002101372700002001393700001601413700001801429773011101447852000901558856009201567930003301659946001101692655001201703IND4411605220221120101250.0081017e200811  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441160522DNAL7 a187648862pmid7 a10.1111/j.1467-789X.2008.00516.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRössner, S.10aLong-term weight loss and weight-loss maintenance strategies  ap. 624-630.  aIt has been suggested that about 20% of subjects undergoing weight-loss programmes can achieve a certain degree of long-term success. At present, surgery remains the only method resulting in long-term sustained weight loss, but access remains restricted. Hence it is important to analyse, in addition to pharmacotherapy, the methods to improve the effects of diet, exercise and behavioural modification. Since these techniques are less spectacular than others, there is a risk that their potential will be overlooked, in spite of the fact that they remain the main alternative for most subjects undergoing weight-loss therapy. This review summarizes realistic treatment alternatives and also provides data from a day care treatment, a strategy not much reported in the literature. This is a standard treatment modality for diabetes but less common in obesity treatment. 3adiabetes 3adiet 3aexercise 3aobesity 3arisk 3asurgery 3aweight loss 2aBehavior Therapy 2aHumans 2aOverweightxtherapy 2aStarvation 2aTime Factors 2aWeight Loss 0aday care 0aweight-loss maintenance1 aHammarstrand, M.1 aHemmingsson, E.1 aNeovius, M.1 aJohansson, K.0 tObesity reviews.g2008 Nov., v. 9, no. 6 p.624-630dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx1467-78817nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-789X.2008.00516.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20081017b20081101c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03101naa a2200769 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100003000164245013100194300001400325520087600339650001701215650001201232650001001244650001201254650001301266650001101279650001101290650002301301650001101324650001001335650000901345650001201354650000901366650001001375650001401385650000901399650001101408650002101419650001201440650001101452650001401463650001301477650001101490650001101501650003701512650000901549650001201558650003301570650003101603650005201634650000901686650002401695650002101719650002201740650003101762650002101793653004901814653001601863653003401879700002501913700002301938700002601961700002201987700001502009700002502024773013202049852000902181856008502190930003302275946001102308655001202319IND4399257720221120101220.0071223e200801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439925772DNAL7 a179942272pmid7 a10.1007/s00216-007-1690-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGonzález-Fernández, M. 10aMetal-binding molecules in the organs of Mus musculus by size-exclusion chromatography coupled with UV spectroscopy and ICP-MS  ap. 17-28.  aMus musculus mice have been investigated for the total elements content in different organs (lung, liver, spleen, kidney, brain, testicle, heart and muscle) and molecular mass distribution patterns of Mn, Ni, Cu, Zn, As, Pb, Cr, Fe, Co, Se and Cd. Some differences have been found in the organs studied, with especially relevant being the Cu-containing fraction present only in the brain and the As-containing one in the liver. Other differences related to the abundance of the metallospecies have also been found. The present paper is the first step in the study of the “metallome” of this inbred laboratory species from which the genome is completely known. This organism could be used as a model in future studies focused on wild mice and the analytical approach developed could be applied to wild mice to find markers of environmental pollution.

The term “catalomics” defines an emerging '-omics' field in which high-throughput studies of enzymes are carried out by using advanced chemical proteomics approaches. Of the various available methods, microarrays have emerged as a powerful and versatile platform to accelerate not only the functional annotation but also the substrate and inhibitor specificity (e.g. substrate and inhibitor fingerprinting, respectively) of enzymes. Herein, we review recent developments in the fabrication of various types of microarray technologies (protein-, peptide- and small-molecule-based microarrays) and their applications in high-throughput characterizations of enzymes. 3aenzymes 3amicroarray technology 3aproteomics 0aEnzyme assay 0aMicroarray 0aCatalomics 0aActivity-based probe 0aActivity-based fingerprinting 0aInhibitor fingerprinting 0aDrug discovery 0aEnzyme assay 0aMicroarray 0aCatalomics 0aActivity-based probe 0aActivity-based fingerprinting 0aInhibitor fingerprinting 0aDrug discovery1 aChattopadhaya, Souvik 1 aWang, Jun 1 aYao, Shao Q. 0 tAnalytical and bioanalytical chemistry.g2006 Oct., v. 386, no. 3 p.416-426dBerlin/Heidelberg : Springer-Verlagx1618-26427nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00216-006-0511-53Available from publisher's Web site.  a20070715b20070802c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03037naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100002000171245012400191300001600315520121500331650002701546650002801573650001701601650001301618650002301631650003101654650001001685650002101695650000901716650001201725650001301737650002101750650001101771650001401782650001701796650001301813650002601826650001801852650004201870650002101912650001301933650003001946650002101976650007201997650004402069653000902113653001502122700002102137700002102158773012302179852000902302856009202311930003302403946001102436655001202447IND4411577520221120075936.0081017e200811  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441157752DNAL7 a190540852pmid7 a10.1111/j.1574-6968.2008.01360.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVinckx, Tiffany10aLoss of the oxidative stress regulator OxyR in Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 impairs growth under iron-limited conditions  ap. 258-265.  aPyoverdine is the main siderophore secreted by fluorescent pseudomonads to scavenge iron in the extracellular environment. Iron uptake, however, needs to be tightly regulated, because free iron stimulates the formation of highly toxic oxygen derivatives. In the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the transcriptional regulator OxyR plays a key role in the upregulation of defense mechanisms against oxidative stress as it stimulates the expression of the antioxidant genes katB, ahpB and ahpCF after contact with oxidative stress-generating agents. Inactivation of the oxyR gene in Pseudomonas fluorescens ATCC 17400 and in P. aeruginosa PAO1 impairs pyoverdine-mediated iron uptake. The pyoverdine utilization defect can be restored by complementation with the oxyR gene of P. aeruginosa, as well as by adding catalase. Growth of the oxyR mutant in low- or high-iron media is also impaired at a low, but not at a high inoculum density. Uptake of radioactive ⁵⁹Fe pyoverdine is, however, not affected by the oxyR mutation, nor is the transcription of the fpvA gene encoding the ferripyoverdine receptor, suggesting that the defect lies in the inability to remove iron from the ferrisiderophore. 3aPseudomonas aeruginosa 3aPseudomonas fluorescens 3aantioxidants 3acatalase 3adefense mechanisms 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3ainoculum density 3airon 3amutants 3amutation 3aoxidative stress 3aoxygen 3apathogens 3asiderophores 3atoxicity 3atranscription factors 2aCulture Media 2aGene Expression Regulation, Bacterial 2aIronxmetabolism 2aMutation 2aOligopeptidesxmetabolism 2aOxidative Stress 2aPseudomonas aeruginosaxgeneticsxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aTrans-Activatorsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 0aOxyR 0apyoverdine1 aMatthijs, Sandra1 aCornelis, Pierre0 tFEMS microbiology letters.g2008 Nov., v. 288, no. 2 p.258-265dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0378-10977nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1574-6968.2008.01360.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20081017b20081101c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03505naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024004200133040001800175100001300193245016800206300001600374506007600390520151300466506003701979650002702016650002502043650001702068650001302085650001202098650001102110650002002121650001302141650002502154650001402179650001402193650006502207650003202272650003302304650003202337650001102369650002802380650002402408650002802432650002702460650002702487650002402514653001802538700001702556700002302573700001902596700002002615773012302635852000902758856009202767930003302859946001102892655001202903IND4411576020221207101150.0081017e200811  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441157602DNAL7 a188233962pmid7 aPMC26673072pmcid7 a10.1111/j.1574-6968.2008.01336.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDo, Thuy10aEvidence for recombination between a sialidase (nanH) of Actinomyces naeslundii and Actinomyces oris, previously named 'Actinomyces naeslundii genospecies 1 and 2'  ap. 156-162.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aActinomyces spp., predominant members of human oral biofilms, may use extracellular sialidase to promote adhesion, deglycosylate immunoglobulins and liberation of nutrients. Partial nanH gene sequences (1077 bp) from Actinomyces oris (n=74), Actinomyces naeslundii (n=30), Actinomyces viscosus (n=1) and Actinomyces johnsonii (n=2) which included the active-site region and the bacterial neuraminidase repeats (BNRs) were compared. The sequences were aligned and each species formed a distinct cluster with five isolates having intermediate positions. These five isolates (two A. oris and three A. naeslundii) exhibited interspecies recombination. The nonsynonymous/synonymous ratio was <1 for both A. oris and A. naeslundii indicating that nanH in both species is under stabilizing selective pressure; nonsynonymous mutations are not selected. However, for A. oris significant negative values in tests for neutral selection suggested the rate of mutation in A. oris was greater than in A. naeslundii but with selection against nonsynonymous mutations. This was supported by the observation that the frequency of polymorphic sites in A. oris, which were monomorphic in A. naeslundii was significantly greater than the frequency of polymorphic sites in A. naeslundii which were monomorphic in A. oris (χ²=7.011; P=0.00081). The higher proportions of A. oris in the oral biofilm might be explained by the higher mutation rate facilitating an increased ability to respond successfully to environmental stress.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aActinomyces naeslundii 3aActinomyces viscosus 3aactive sites 3aadhesion 3abiofilm 3ahumans 3aimmunoglobulins 3amutation 3anucleotide sequences 3anutrients 3asialidase 2aActinomycesxenzymologyxgeneticsxisolation & purification. 2aActinomycosisxmicrobiology 2aBacterial Proteinsxgenetics 2aDental Plaquexmicrobiology 2aHumans 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aMouthxmicrobiology 2aNeuraminidasexgenetics 2aRecombination, Genetic 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 2aSpecies Specificity 0adental plaque1 aHenssge, Uta1 aGilbert, Steven C.1 aClark, Douglas1 aBeighton, David0 tFEMS microbiology letters.g2008 Nov., v. 288, no. 2 p.156-162dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0378-10977nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1574-6968.2008.01336.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20081017b20081101c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02933naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100001700171245011200188300001600300520137700316650002001693650001601713650002601729650002301755650001201778650001801790650002801808650002101836650001001857650003001867650001801897650001701915650002401932650003001956650005901986650005102045650002402096700001302120700001502133700001602148700001602164773008902180852000902269856009202278930003302370945001302403946001102416655001202427IND2321318020221122061135.0010604e200103  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232131802DNAL7 a112982332pmid7 a10.1046/j.1365-2672.2001.01255.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVasserot, Y.12aA study into the role of L-aspartic acid on the metabolism of L-malic acid and D-glucose by Oenococcus oeni  ap. 380-387.  aAims: The purpose of this work was to study the effect of L-aspartic acid concentration on bacterial growth, D-glucose fermentation and L-malic acid consumption of Oenococcus oeni NCFB 1707. Methods and Results: Bacterial cultures were performed in synthetic media. Bacterial growth, D-glucose fermentation and L-malic acid consumption were reduced when L-aspartic acid concentration became excessive. This inhibitory effect of high concentrations of L-aspartic acid on bacterial growth was also observed with several Oenococcus oeni strains, except O. oeni BL01. The L-aspartic acid inhibitory effect on bacterial growth could be reduced by increasing the concentration of L-glutamic acid. L-glutamic acid transport was found to be competitively inhibited by L-aspartic acid. In addition, an excessive amount of L-aspartic acid modified D-glucose metabolism, with an overproduction of acetic acid and reduced ethanol production. Conclusions: Since L-glutamic acid is an essential amino acid for the bacterial strain used, the L-aspartic acid inhibitory effect on bacterial growth could be linked to its involvement in an antagonistic interaction with L-glutamic acid. Significance and Impact of the Study: Such antagonistic interactions between amino acids in O. oeni strains could be another explanation for the difficulties of inducing malolactic fermentation in wines. 3aOenococcus oeni 3aacetic acid 3aessential amino acids 3aethanol production 3aglucose 3aglutamic acid 3amalolactic fermentation 3amicrobial growth 3awines 2aAspartic Acidxmetabolism 2aCulture Media 2aFermentation 2aGlucosexmetabolism 2aGlutamic Acidxmetabolism 2aGram-Positive Coccixgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aLeuconostocxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aMalatesxmetabolism1 aDion, C.1 aBonnet, E.1 aMaujean, A.1 aJeandet, P.0 tJournal of applied microbiology.g2001 Mar., v. 90, no. 3 p.380-387x1364-50727nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2672.2001.01255.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20010702b20010710c00000000  aINDdGK1  aNon-US 7aarticle04242naa a2200745 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100001800171245018200189300001600371520191000387650002802297650002302325650002102348650002202369650002502391650002602416650002302442650001102465650002202476650002002498650001002518650001802528650001002546650001602556650002102572650002202593650002102615650001302636650001402649650003902663650001302702650000902715650001402724650002402738650002202762650004002784650002202824650001302846650005402859650002502913650003302938650002802971650002602999650002803025650006203053653001303115700001503128700001103143700002003154700002003174700002403194700001903218773008903237852000903326856009203335930003303427945001303460946001103473655001203484IND2321315920221122041315.0010604e200103  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232131592DNAL7 a112982252pmid7 a10.1046/j.1365-2672.2001.01248.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShanmugam, V.10aPurification and characterization of an extracellular alpha-glucosidase protein from Trichoderma viride which degrades a phytotoxin associated with sheath blight disease in rice  ap. 320-329.  aAims: To purify and characterize an extracellular alpha-glucosidase from Trichoderma viride capable of inactivating a host-specific phytotoxin, designated RS toxin, produced by the rice sheath blight pathogen, Rhizoctonia solani Kuhn. Methods and Results: The host-specific RS toxin was purified from both culture filtrates (culture filtrate toxin, CFTox) and R. solani-inoculated rice sheaths (sheath blight toxin, SBTox). Sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analyses of extracellular proteins, purified from a biocontrol fungus T. viride (TvMNT7) grown on SBTox and CFTox separately, were carried out. The antifungal activity of the purified high molecular weight protein (110 kDa) was studied against RS toxin as well as on the sclerotial germination and mycelial growth of R. solani. Enzyme assay and Western blot analysis with the antirabbit TvMNT7 110-kDa protein indicated that the protein was an alpha-glucosidase. The 110-kDa protein was highly specific to RS toxin and its Michaelis-Menten constant value was 0.40 mmol l-1 when p-nitrophenyl alpha-D-glucopyranoside was used as the substrate. The isoelectric point of the protein was 5.2. N-terminal sequencing of the alpha-glucosidase protein showed that its amino acid sequence showed no homology with other known alpha-glucosidases. Conclusions: This appears to be the first report of the purification and characterization of an alpha-glucosidase capable of inactivating a host-specific toxin of fungal origin. The alpha-glucosidase is specific to RS toxin and is different from the known alpha-glucosidases. Significance and Impact of the Study: As RS toxin could be inactivated by the microbial alpha-glucosidase enzyme, isolation of the gene that codes for the enzyme from T. viride and transfer of the gene to rice plants would lead to enhanced resistance against sheath blight pathogen by inactivation of RS toxin. 3aThanatephorus cucumeris 3aTrichoderma viride 3aWestern blotting 3aalpha-glucosidase 3aamino acid sequences 3aantifungal properties 3abiological control 3ablight 3aculture filtrates 3aenzyme kinetics 3afungi 3agene transfer 3agenes 3agermination 3ahost specificity 3aisoelectric point 3amolecular weight 3amycelium 3apathogens 3apolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 3aproteins 3arice 3asclerotia 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aBlotting, Western 2aElectrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel 2aIsoelectric Point 2aKinetics 2aMycotoxinsxisolation & purificationxmetabolism. 2aOryzaxmicrobiology. 2aPlant Diseasesxmicrobiology 2aRhizoctoniaxmetabolism 2aSubstrate Specificity 2aTrichodermaxenzymology 2aalpha-Glucosidasesxisolation & purificationxmetabolism. 0ars toxin1 aSriram, S.1 aBābu.1 aNantakumār, R.1 aRaguchander, T.1 aBalasubramanian, P.1 aSamiyappan, R.0 tJournal of applied microbiology.g2001 Mar., v. 90, no. 3 p.320-329x1364-50727nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2672.2001.01248.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20010702b20010710c00000000  aINDdGK1  aNon-US 7aarticle01634naa a2200337 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100002000115245004500135300001400180520074500194650001900939650001300958650002300971650001700994650002001011650002301031650002801054650001401082650001401096650001401110650001401124773008301138852000901221930003301230945000801263946001301271655001201284991618530100742620221122041310.0880523e198701  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI880009072DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHendricks, K.M.10aLiver disease and nutrition in the child  ap. 79-87.  aA technical review discusses the effects of liver disease in children on inducing alterations in the metabolism of nutrients, and provides representative examples of cholestatic changes and nutrient aberrations seen in chronic cholestasis.

Contact plate results appeared to reflect the degree of dampness of hands after drying rather than the actual numbers of micro-organisms on the hands. In laboratory tests, a reduction in airborne count of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus of between 40 and 75% was achieved from 600 readings comparing inlets and outlets of warm air hand driers. In washroom trials, the number of airborne micro-organisms was reduced by between 30 and 75%. Air emitted from the outlet of the driers contained significantly fewer micro-organisms than air entering the driers. Drying of hands with hand driers was no more likely to generate airborne micro-organisms than drying with paper towels. Levels of micro-organisms on external surfaces of hand driers were not significantly different to those on other washroom surfaces. This work shows that warm air hand driers, of the type used in this study, are a hygienic method of drying hands and therefore appropriate for use in both the healthcare and food industry. 3aPseudomonas aeruginosa 3aStaphylococcus aureus 3aair 3adryers 3adrying 3afood industry 3ahands 3ahealth services 3ahygiene 3alaboratory experimentation 3amicroorganisms 3apaper 2aAir Microbiology 2aBacteriaxisolation & purification 2aColony Count, Microbial 2aEquipment Contamination 2aHandxmicrobiology 2aHand Disinfection 2aHot Temperature 2aHumans 2aPaper 2aPseudomonas aeruginosaxisolation & purification 2aSkinxmicrobiology 2aStaphylococcus aureusxisolation & purification 0ahealth care industry1 aBrown, K.L.1 aToivenen, J.1 aHolah, J.T.0 tJournal of applied microbiology.g2000 Dec., v. 89, no. 6 p.910-919x1364-50727nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2672.2000.01122.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20010601b20010612c00000000  aINDdGK1  aNon-US 7aarticle01331naa a2200265 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100001300115245003800128300001400166520063800180650001200818650001300830650001700843653001600860700001700876773009700893852000900990939003300999945000801032946001301040655001201053991618529240742620221122032608.0880505e198704  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI880005942DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWise, J.10aProteinuria in the obese diabetic  ap. 30-37.  aA technical report provides a background review of diabetic patients with microproteinuria (or microalbuminuria (MAU)) and the characteristics of maturity-onset diabetics, and discusses the results of a pilot study of the effects of an angiotension-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor (Captopril) on proteinuria (PU) in 5 obese type IIb diabetics.

The genes associated with production of organic acids in C. glutamicum were inactivated and the alanine dehydrogenase gene (alaD) from Lysinibacillus sphaericus was overexpressed to direct carbon flux from organic acids to alanine. Although the alaD-expressing strain produced alanine from glucose under oxygen deprivation, its productivity was relatively low due to retarded glucose consumption. Homologous overexpression of the gapA gene encoding glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) in the alaD-expressing strain stimulated glucose consumption and consequently improved alanine productivity. In contrast gapA overexpression did not affect glucose consumption under aerobic conditions, indicating that oxygen deprivation engendered inefficient regeneration of NAD⁺ resulting in impaired GAPDH activity and reduced glucose consumption in the alanine-producing strains. Inactivation of the alanine racemase gene allowed production of l-alanine with optical purity greater than 99.5%. The resulting strain produced 98 g l⁻¹ of l-alanine after 32 h in mineral salts medium. Our results show promise for amino acid production under oxygen deprivation. 3aCorynebacterium glutamicum 3aLysinibacillus sphaericus 3aaerobic conditions 3aalanine 3aalanine dehydrogenase 3acarbon 3aengineering 3agene overexpression 3agenes 3agenetic engineering 3aglucose 3aglyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase 3ametabolism 3aorganic acids and salts 3aoxygen 3asalts 2aAlaninexmetabolism 2aAlanine Dehydrogenasexgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aAnaerobiosis 2aBacillalesxenzymology 2aBacterial Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aCorynebacterium glutamicumxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aGenetic Engineering 2aGlucosexmetabolism 2aGlyceraldehyde 3-Phosphatexgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aOxygenxmetabolism 0aOxygen deprivation 0aAmino acid production 0aEnvironmentally friendly process1 aFujii, Miho 1 aMori, Eiji 1 aInui, Masayuki 1 aYukawa, Hideaki 0 tApplied microbiology and biotechnology.g2010 June, v. 87, no. 1 p.159-165dBerlin/Heidelberg : Springer-Verlagx0175-75987nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00253-010-2493-73Available from publisher's Web site  a20100522b20100605c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03527naa a2200649 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002000110040001800130100001700148245010900165300001600274500002400290506007600314520136000390506003701750650001801787650002501805650002201830650002801852650002401880650002201904650001901926650001801945650001701963650001801980650002401998650001802022650004202040650002302082650004202105650002902147650002802176650003202204650005502236650004202291650004302333650002502376650004402401650003402445653001702479653002502496653001602521653001102537700001402548700001502562700001502577773015102592852000902743856005402752930003302806945001302839946001302852655001202865IND2196701820221207125550.0990128e199807  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND219670182DNAL7 a96625372pmid7 aPMC349492pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRansom, W.D.10aPhosphoglycerylethanolamine posttranslational modification of plant eukaryotic elongation factor 1 alpha  ap. 949-960.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aEukaryotic elongation factor 1alpha (eEF-1A) is a multifunctional protein. There are three known posttranslational modifications of eEF-1A that could potentially affect its function. Except for phosphorylation, the other posttranslational modifications have not been demonstrated in plants. Using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-mass spectrometry and peptide mass mapping, we show that carrot (Daucus carota L.) eEF-1A contains a phosphoglycerylethanolamine (PGE) posttranslational modification. eEF-1A was the only protein labeled with [14C]ethanolamine in carrot cells and was the predominant ethanolamine-labeled protein in Arabidopsis seedlings and tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum L.) cell cultures. In vivo-labeling studies using [3H]glycerol, [32P][Pi,[14C]myristic acid, and [14C]linoleic acid indicated that the entire phospholipid phosphatidylethanolamine is covalently attached to the protein. The PGE lipid modification did not affect the partitioning of eEF-1A in Triton X-114 or its actin-binding activity in in vitro assays. Our in vitro data indicate that this newly characterized posttranslational modification alone does not affect the function of eEF-1A. Therefore, the PGE lipid modification may work in combination with other posttranslational modifications to affect the distribution and the function of eEF-1A within the cell.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDaucus carota 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aNicotiana tabacum 3acell suspension culture 3aprotein composition 3aprotein transport 3acell membranes 3aradiolabeling 3aethanolamine 3abinding sites 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aBinding Sites 2aCarbon Radioisotopesxdiagnostic use. 2aConserved Sequence 2aDaucus carotaxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aEthanolaminexmetabolism 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPeptide Elongation Factor 1 2aPeptide Elongation Factorsxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aPhosphatidylethanolaminesxmetabolism 2aPlant Proteinsxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aPolyethylene Glycols 2aProtein Processing, Post-Translational. 2aSequence Homology, Amino Acid 0alocalization 0aglycerophospholipids 0atranslation 0agrowth1 aLao, P.C.1 aGage, D.A.1 aBoss, W.F.0 tPlant physiology.g1998 July, v. 117, no. 3 p.949-960dAmerican Society of Plant PhysiologistsaPlant physiology (Lancaster, Pa.)x0032-08897nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.plantphysiol.org/3electronic resource  a20050129b20050130c00000000  aINDdMKS  aOther US 7aarticle02972naa a2200625 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100001500171245012900186300001600315520116800331650002601499650001301525650001201538650003801550650001501588650001701603650001101620650002101631650001101652650000701663650001501670650001601685650002001701650001201721650002501733650001501758650001001773650000901783650002201792650001001814650003301824650003801857650001101895650001701906650002901923650001101952650003101963650000901994650002302003650002602026700001802052700001702070773008902087852000902176856009202185930003302277945001302310946001102323655001202334IND2268222320221122010614.0010406e200012  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND226822232DNAL7 a111234662pmid7 a10.1046/j.1365-2672.2000.01193.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTakumi, K.10aModelling inactivation of Escherichia coli by low pH: application to passage through the stomach of young and elderly people  ap. 935-943.  aAim: To estimate the survival of enteropathogenic Escherichia coli after passage through the stomach of young and elderly people. Methods and Results: Using enterohaemorrhagic E. coli O157 and a non-pathogenic laboratory strain, inactivation in a pH range between 1.5 and 4.0 was experimentally quantified. Gastric pH and transport have previously been studied in human volunteers following consumption of a solid meal. Combining all these findings, time series of surviving bacteria were mathematically predicted and subsequently, the predictions were validated with in vitro experiments using a pH-controlled fermentor. On average, 20-80% of ingested E. coli are estimated to arrive in the small intestine without inactivation by low pH. The mean overall gastric passage was similar for young and elderly subjects. Conclusions: The tested E. coli strains can survive the human stomach with a high probability. Significance and Impact of the Study: Survival of E. coli under conditions of changing pH in the stomach may be predicted by batch experiments at constant pH. The effectiveness of the gastric acid barrier strongly depends on buffering effects of food. 3aEscherichia coli O157 3abacteria 3aelderly 3aenteropathogenic Escherichia coli 3afermenters 3agastric acid 3ahumans 3ain vitro studies 3amodels 3apH 3aprediction 3aprobability 3asmall intestine 3astomach 3atime series analysis 3avolunteers 2aAdult 2aAged 2aAged, 80 and over 2aAging 2aEscherichia colixphysiology 2aEscherichia coli O157xphysiology 2aFemale 2aFermentation 2aGastrointestinal Transit 2aHumans 2aHydrogen-Ion Concentration 2aMale 2aModels, Biological 2aStomachxmicrobiology1 aJonge, R. de.1 aHavelaar, A.0 tJournal of applied microbiology.g2000 Dec., v. 89, no. 6 p.935-943x1364-50727nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2672.2000.01193.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20010601b20010612c00000000  aINDdGK1  aNon-US 7aarticle01910naa a2200277 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100001700115245011200132300001600244520108100260650001601341650002601357650002301383650002501406653001101431700001701442773009801459852000901557939003301566945000801599946001301607655001201620991618528040742620221122010549.0880503e198707  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI880004872DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBonato, D.P.10aPredictors of weight loss at the end of treatment and 1-year follow-up for a behavioral weight loss program  ap. 573-577.  aExtract: The present study sought to identify predictors of weight loss at the end of a 10-week treatment program and during a 1-year follow-up period. Participants were 83 obese women solicited from the community by advertisement. Results showed that weight loss during the first week of dieting, a greater number of past weight loss attempts, and a larger monthly weight loss goal were predictive of outcome at the end of the 10-week treatment program. Work status, age of onset of obesity, and the ratio of overcome urges to total urges to overeat were predictive of weight loss from the end of treatment to the 1-year follow-up. No pretreatment variables predicted follow-up weight status. Frequency ofbingeing, frequency of urges, and demographic variables (other than age of onset and work status) were not predictive of weight loss at any time. The lack of commality between identified predictors of treatment and follow-up outcomes support the contention that the operative factors leading to weight control differ during the treatment and maintenance phases.

Casein hydrolysates prepared were subjected to Alcalase-catalyzed plastein reaction in the presence or absence of proline addition to prepare casein plasteins. Some optimal reaction conditions of plastein reaction in the presence of proline addition were studied using response surface methodology with the decrease in free amino groups in the casein plasteins as response. When the concentration of casein hydrolysates was fixed at 35% (w w⁻¹) and reaction time at 6 h, the optimal conditions were reaction temperature 48 °C, addition level of proline 0.54 mol/mol free amino groups of casein hydrolysates and addition level of Alcalase 9.5 kU g⁻¹ proteins. With these conditions, the maximal decrease in free amino groups in casein plasteins was 195.7 μmol g⁻¹ proteins. The ACE-inhibitory activities of twelve casein plasteins in vitro, prepared in the presence or absence of proline addition with different reaction extents, were evaluated and compared. The results showed that the ACE-inhibitory activity of the casein plasteins prepared in the presence of proline addition changed irregularly, different to that of the casein plasteins prepared in the absence of proline addition, and might relate to the different linking of proline to the peptides in casein hydrolysates during plastein reaction. When the casein plasteins prepared in the presence of proline addition had a decrease in free amino groups 195.7 μmol g⁻¹ proteins, the IC₅₀ value of the casein plasteins was lowered to 0.2 μg mL⁻¹. 3acasein 3acasein hydrolysates 3afood research 3ahydrolysis 3ainhibitory concentration 50 3apeptides 3aplasteins 3aproline 3aresponse surface methodology 3asubtilisin 3atemperature 0aCasein plasteins 0aPlastein reaction 0aACE-inhibitory activity1 aLi, Tie-Jing 1 aZhao, Xin-Huai 0 tEuropean food research & technology.g2010 June, v. 231, no. 2 p.197-207dBerlin/Heidelberg : Springer-Verlagx1438-23777nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00217-010-1270-23Available from publisher's Web site  a20100514b20100605c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02600naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100001800171245008400189300001600273520099200289650002401281650001201305650002301317650001801340650001501358650001501373650001201388650001001400650001801410650001301428650002301441650001101464650002601475650002301501650001201524650002501536650002901561650003201590650002601622650002901648650002501677650003801702650001701740650002601757700001601783773008901799852000901888856009201897930003301989945001302022946001102035655001202046IND2243738220221121235523.0010316e200011  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND224373822DNAL7 a111191612pmid7 a10.1046/j.1365-2672.2000.01190.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aScanlon, M.P.10aInactivation of Mycobacterium bovis in cattle slurry by five volatile chemicals  ap. 854-861.  aThis research was undertaken to evaluate volatile chemicals which retained mycobactericidal activity in cattle slurry.

Despite their importance, their modes of virulence have yet to be fully elucidated. Here, we present a previously unreported bacteriophage extracted from a toxin-producing strain of V. harveyi isolated from moribund prawn larvae in tropical Australia. Classification into the family Myoviridae was based upon morphological characteristics (an icosahedral head, a neck/collar region and a sheathed rigid tail) and nucleic acid characteristics (double-stranded linear DNA). We have termed the bacteriophage VHML (Vibrio Harveyi Myovirus Like). VHML is a temperate bacteriophage that has a narrow host range and shows an apparent preference for V. harveyi above other vibrios (63 Vibrio isolates tested) and other genera (10 other genera were tested). The conventional methods for phage concentration and extraction of nucleic acids from phage particles were not efficient and the alternative methods that were used are discussed. 3aCrustacea 3aDNA 3aMyoviridae 3aVibrio harveyi 3abacteriophages 3afish 3ahost range 3alarvae 3ashrimp 3aviral morphology 3avirulence 2aAnimals 2aBacterial Toxinsxbiosynthesis 2aBacteriophagesxclassificationxgeneticsxisolation & purificationxultrastructure. 2aDNA, Viralxanalysis 2aVibrioxmetabolismxvirology. 3aAustralia 0aAustralia 0avibrio harvey 0amyovirus like1 aOwens, L.0 tJournal of applied microbiology.g2000 Oct., v. 89, no. 4 p.702-709x1364-50727nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2672.2000.01169.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20010501b20010507c00000000  aINDdGK1  aNon-US 7aarticle01931naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002600145245013500171300001800306520068900324650001401013650001201027650002001039650001701059650002701076650000901103651001001112653001701122653002901139653002001168700001701188700003001205700002201235700002301257773011501280852000901395856008501404930003301489946001101522655001201533IND4437509220221121223810.0100522e201006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443750922DNAL7 a10.1007/s10592-009-9895-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAguirre, Maria Pilar 10aIsolation and characterization of polymorphic microsatellite markers in the grasshopper Mioscirtus wagneri (Orthoptera: Acrididae)  ap. 1119-1121.  aEight polymorphic microsatellite markers were developed for the grasshopper Mioscirtus wagneri. Polymorphism at these loci was evaluated in 25 individuals from Central Spain. The number of alleles per locus ranged from 3 to 9 and their observed and expected heterozygosities ranged from 0.28 to 0.80 and 0.25 to 0.84, respectively. All genotypic frequencies conformed to Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium expectations, with no evidence of genotypic linkage disequilibrium between any pair of loci. These loci will be highly useful for the study of the population genetic structure and diversity of this grasshopper species forming highly fragmented populations of great conservation concern. 3aAcrididae 3aalleles 3agenetic markers 3agrasshoppers 3alinkage disequilibrium 3aloci 3aSpain 0aDinucleotide 0aPopulation fragmentation 0aTetranucleotide1 aBloor, Paul 1 aRamírez-Escobar, Ursula 1 aOrtego, Joaquín 1 aCordero, Pedro J. 0 tConservation genetics.g2010 June, v. 11, no. 3 p.1119-1121dDordrecht : Springer Netherlandsx1566-06217nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10592-009-9895-z3Available from publisher's Web site  a20100522b20100605c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03669naa a2200613 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100001600171245017600187300001600363520169400379650002902073650000902102650000902111650001502120650002402135650001602159650001202175650001402187650001402201650000702215650001302222650001202235650002502247650001302272650001602285650001402301650003202315650001202347650003702359650001202396650004902408650003802457650003102495650010502526650004602631650003002677650002702707650001002734700001602744700001802760700001802778773008902796852000902885856009202894930003302986945001303019946001103032655001203043IND2243828020221121214346.0010323e200010  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND224382802DNAL7 a110541572pmid7 a10.1046/j.1365-2672.2000.01147.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGrill, J.P.10aIsolation and characterization of a Lactobacillus amylovorus mutant depleted in conjugated bile salt hydrolase activity: relation between activity and bile salt resistance  ap. 553-563.  aGrowth experiments were conducted on Lactobacillus amylovorus DN-112053 in batch culture, with or without pH regulation. Conjugated bile salt hydrolase (CBSH) activity was examined as a function of culture growth. The CBSH activity increased during growth but its course depended on bile salts type and culture conditions. A Lact. amylovorus mutant was isolated from the wild-type strain of Lact. amylovorus DN-112053 after mutagenesis with N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine. An agar plate assay was used to detect mutants without CBSH activity. In resting cell experiments, the strain showed reduced activity. Differences between growth parameters determined for wild-type and mutant strains were not detected. Comparative native gel electrophoresis followed by CBSH activity staining demonstrated the loss of proteins harbouring this activity in the mutant. Four protein bands corresponding to CBSH were observed in the wild-type strain but only one was detected in the mutant. The specific growth rate of the mutant strain was affected more by bile salts than the wild-type strain. Nevertheless, bile was more toxic for the wild-type strain. In viability studies in the presence of nutrients, it was demonstrated that glycodeoxycholic acid exerted a higher toxicity than taurodeoxycholic acid in a pH-dependent manner. No difference was apparent between the two strains. In the absence of nutrients, the wild-type strain died after 2 h whereas no effect was observed for the mutant. The de-energization experiments performed using the ionophores nigericin and valinomycin suggested that the chemical potential of protons (ZdeltapH) was involved in Lactobacillus bile salt resistance. 3aLactobacillus amylovorus 3aagar 3abile 3abile salts 3agel electrophoresis 3amutagenesis 3amutants 3anigericin 3anutrients 3apH 3aproteins 3aprotons 3aspecific growth rate 3atoxicity 3avalinomycin 3aviability 2aAmidohydrolasesxmetabolism 2aAnimals 2aBile Acids and Saltsxmetabolism 2aBiomass 2aElectrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gelxmethods 2aGlycodeoxycholic Acidxmetabolism 2aHydrogen-Ion Concentration 2aLactobacillus acidophilusxdrug effectsxenzymologyxgrowth & developmentxisolation & purification. 2aMethylnitronitrosoguanidinexpharmacology 2aMutagenesisxdrug effects 2aMutagensxpharmacology 2aSwine1 aCayuela, C.1 aAntoine, J.M.1 aSchneider, F.0 tJournal of applied microbiology.g2000 Oct., v. 89, no. 4 p.553-563x1364-50727nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2672.2000.01147.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20010501b20010507c00000000  aINDdGK1  aNon-US 7aarticle03018naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001900152245011000171300001600281520155900297650001101856650001901867650001701886650001901903650002401922650001801946650001501964650001401979650001001993650001502003650001002018650002102028651002102049653001902070653000902089653001402098653002502112700002002137700002102157700001902178700001902197700001902216700002202235773010802257852000902365856009202374930003302466946001302499655001202512IND4439318920221121134713.0100702e201007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443931892DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1744-7429.2009.00617.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFox, Julian C.10aAssessment of Aboveground Carbon in Primary and Selectively Harvested Tropical Forest in Papua New Guinea  ap. 410-419.  aPapua New Guinea (PNG) has become the focus of climate change mitigation initiatives such as reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation, but defensible estimates of forest carbon are lacking. Here we present a methodology for estimating aboveground forest carbon, and apply it to a large Permanent Sample Plot system maintained by Papua New Guinea Forest Research Institute. We report the first estimates of forest carbon in lowland tropical forest in PNG. Average aboveground carbon in stems >10 cm diam. for 115 selectively harvested 1-ha plots in lowland tropical forest was 66.3±3.5 Mg C/ha (95% CI) while for 10 primary forest plots the average was 106.3±16.2 Mg C/ha. We applied ratios based on field observations, in-country studies, and the literature to estimate unmeasured pools of aboveground carbon (stems <10 cm diam., fine litter and coarse woody debris). Total aboveground carbon was estimated at 90.2 and 120.8 Mg C/ha in selectively harvested and primary lowland forest, respectively. Our estimate for primary tropical forest is lower than biome averages for tropical equatorial forest, and we hypothesize that frequent disturbances from fire, frost, landslides, and agriculture are limiting carbon stock development. The methodology and estimates presented here will assist the PNG government in its preparedness for mitigation initiatives, are of interest to communities that are seeking to participate in voluntary carbon markets, and will encourage transparency and consistency in the estimation of forest carbon. 3acarbon 3acarbon markets 3acarbon sinks 3aclimate change 3acoarse woody debris 3adeforestation 3aecosystems 3aemissions 3afrost 3alandslides 3astems 3atropical forests 3aPapua New Guinea 0apermanent plot 0aREDD 0asecondary 0aselective harvesting1 aYosi, Cossey K.1 aNimiago, Patrick1 aOavika, Forova1 aPokana, Joe N.1 aLavong, Kunsey1 aKeenan, Rodney J.0 tBiotropica.g2010 July, v. 42, no. 4 p.410-419dMalden, USA : Blackwell Publishing Incx0006-36067nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1744-7429.2009.00617.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20100702b20100807c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle01573naa a2200301 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100001500115245014700130300001400277500001500291520067000306650002800976650002901004650002301033650001501056650001201071650001301083653001701096773008301113852000901196939003301205945000801238946001301246655001201259991618523190742620221121134732.0880422e198609  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI880002922DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTashev, T.10aNutritional aspects of obesity and diabetes and their relation to cardiovascular diseases and mortality: preventive health and social measures  ap. 12-14.  a2019-12-04  aA report of a 1984 workshop on preventive health and social measures concerning nutritional aspects of obesity and diabetes and their relation to cardiovascular diseases and mortality presents highlights and recommendations of the workshop.

For each case study, the paper describes: a) the reasons for planting or not planting trees, b) how the income received from wood was used, c) the main disadvantages related to tree planting, and d) farmers willingness to continue tree planting under the current arrangements. The tree planters were mainly the farmers with more land; higher value of total assets; and with more active participation in farmer's groups or other social organizations. Long rotation length, lack of capital, low wood prices, and poor access to production inputs or markets affected farmers' willingness to plant trees in the future. Policies are needed that are conducive to the establishment of markets for fiber and timber with fair and reasonable pricing structures. 3aassets 3acapital 3acase studies 3afarmers 3aincome 3aissues and policy 3amarkets 3aplanters 3aplanting 3aprices 3asocioeconomics 3atrees 3awood 3aBorneo 3aIndonesia1 aKanninen, Markku1 aRohadi, Dede0 tForests, trees and livelihoods.g2011, v. 20, no. 2-3 p.191-209x1472-80287nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14728028.2011.97567063Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b00000000c20140425  aNon-US 7aarticle03556naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004100092040001800133072000900151072000900160072000900169072000900178072000900187100001700196245017800213300001600391500002400407500001500431520176300446650001902209650001102228650002002239650002102259650002002280650002502300650001702325650002102342650001602363650001002379650002002389650003102409650001002440650002202450650002602472650001902498650001102517650002502528653001802553700001402571700001802585700001502603700001802618700002602636773011102662852000902773856009102782930003302873945002502906946001102931655001202942IND4388698120221121075640.0070308e200704  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438869812DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envexpbot.2006.04.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF600 0aF500 0aJ500 0aB200 0aW0001 aPozo, A. del10aGas exchange acclimation to elevated CO2 in upper-sunlit and lower-shaded canopy leaves in relation to nitrogen acquisition and partitioning in wheat grown in field chambers  ap. 371-380.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aGrowth at elevated CO2 often decreases photosynthetic capacity (acclimation) and leaf N concentrations. Lower-shaded canopy leaves may undergo both CO2 and shade acclimation. The relationship of acclimatory responses of flag and lower-shaded canopy leaves of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) to the N content, and possible factors affecting N gain and distribution within the plant were investigated in a wheat crop growing in field chambers set at ambient (360 μmol mol-1) and elevated (700 μmol mol-1) CO2, and with two amounts of N fertilizer (none and 70 kg ha-1 applied on 30 April). Photosynthesis, stomatal conductance and transpiration at a common measurement CO2, chlorophyll and Rubisco levels of upper-sunlit (flag) and lower-shaded canopy leaves were significantly lower in elevated relative to ambient CO2-grown plants. Both whole shoot N and leaf N per unit area decreased at elevated CO2, and leaf N declined with canopy position. Acclimatory responses to elevated CO2 were enhanced in N-deficient plants. With N supply, the acclimatory responses were less pronounced in lower canopy leaves relative to the flag leaf. Additional N did not increase the fraction of shoot N allocated to the flag and penultimate leaves. The decrease in photosynthetic capacity in both upper-sunlit and lower-shaded leaves in elevated CO2 was associated with a decrease in N contents in above-ground organs and with lower N partitioning to leaves. A single relationship of N per unit leaf area to the transpiration rate accounted for a significant fraction of the variation among sun-lit and shaded leaves, growth CO2 level and N supply. We conclude that reduced stomatal conductance and transpiration can decrease plant N, leading to acclimation to CO2 enrichment. 3acarbon dioxide 3acanopy 3asolar radiation 3anitrogen content 3aplant nutrition 3astomatal conductance 3agas exchange 3afertilizer rates 3aacclimation 3awheat 3anutrient uptake 3aelevated atmospheric gases 3ashade 3aTriticum aestivum 3anutrient partitioning 3aphotosynthesis 3aleaves 3anitrogen fertilizers 0atranspiration1 aPerez, P.1 aGutierrez, D.1 aAlonso, A.1 aMorcuende, R.1 aMartinez-Carrasco, R.0 tEnvironmental and experimental botany.g2007 Apr., v. 59, no. 3 p.371-380dPergamon Pressx0098-84727nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envexpbot.2006.04.0093Available from publisher's Web site  a20070820b20070902c00000000  aINDd2CTe2007/08/03  aNon-US 7aarticle03922naa a2200709 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001900164245013400183300001600317520186100333650001102194650001002205650001902215650001302234650002002247650001102267650001202278650001102290650001302301650001302314650001502327650001302342650001702355650001202372650002302384650001102407650001202418650001202430650001302442650002002455650001602475650002502491650001202516650002202528650002802550650003402578650003002612650002502642650003302667650001902700650001402719650003302733650003502766650002302801650001402824651002902838653002102867653002402888653001602912700002902928773010502957852000903062856008503071930003303156946001103189655001203200IND4386571820221121075614.0070107e200702  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438657182DNAL7 a171245702pmid7 a10.1007/s00442-006-0559-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNavarro, Joan 10aExperimental increase of flying costs in a pelagic seabird: effects on foraging strategies, nutritional state and chick condition  ap. 150-160.  aA central point in life history theory is that parental investment in current reproduction should be balanced by the costs in terms of residual reproductive value. Long-lived seabirds are considered fixed investors, that is, parents fix a specific level of investment in their current reproduction independent to the breeding requirements. We tested this hypothesis analysing the consequences of an experimental increase in flying costs on the foraging ecology, body condition and chick condition in Cory's shearwaters Calonectris diomedea. We treated 28 pairs by reducing the wing surface in one partner and compared them with 14 control pairs. We monitored mass changes and incubation shifts and tracked 19 foraging trips per group using geolocators. Furthermore, we took blood samples at laying, hatching and chick-rearing to analyse the nutritional condition, haematology, muscle damage and stable isotopes. Eighty-day-old chicks were measured, blood sampled and challenged with PHA immune assay. In addition, we analysed the effects of handicap on the adults at the subsequent breeding season. During incubation, handicapped birds showed a greater foraging effort than control birds, as indicated by greater foraging distances and longer periods of foraging, covering larger areas. Eighty-day-old chicks reared by treated pairs were smaller and lighter and showed a lower immunity than those reared by control pairs. However, oxygen demands, nutritional condition and stable isotopes did not differ between control and handicapped birds. Although handicapped birds had to increase their foraging effort, they maintained physical condition by reducing parental investment and transferred the experimentally increased costs to their partners and the chick. This result supports the fixed investment hypothesis and is consistent with life history theory. 3aadults 3ablood 3abody condition 3abreeding 3abreeding season 3achicks 3aecology 3aflight 3aforaging 3ahatching 3ahematology 3aimmunity 3alife history 3amuscles 3anutritional status 3aoxygen 3aparents 3arearing 3aseabirds 3astable isotopes 2aAge Factors 2aAnalysis of Variance 2aAnimals 2aBirdsxphysiology 2aBlood Chemical Analysis 2aBody Constitutionxphysiology 2aBody Weights and Measures 2aCase-Control Studies 2aFeeding Behaviorxphysiology 2aFlight, Animal 2aGeography 2aNesting Behaviorxphysiology 2aNutritional Statusxphysiology 2aOxygenxmetabolism 2aTelemetry 0aIslands of the Atlantic. 0aForaging ecology 0aLife history theory 0aShearwaters1 aGonzález-Solís, Jacob 0 tOecologia.g2007 Feb., v. 151, no. 1 p.150-160dBerlin/Heidelberg : Springer-Verlagx0029-85497nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00442-006-0559-03Available from publisher's Web site  a20071209b20080102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03186naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004100092040001800133072000900151072000900160072000900169100001300178245010300191300001600294500002400310500001500334520150500349650001701854650000901871650001301880650002101893650004301914650001101957650001801968650001801986650001702004650001702021650001402038650001602052650001202068650002602080650001902106650001502125650001002140653001302150700001402163700001802177700001602195700001602211700001502227700001602242700001702258700001702275773011102292852000902403856009102412930003302503945002502536946001102561655001202572IND4388698220221121075619.0070308e200704  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438869822DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envexpbot.2006.04.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF841 0aF200 0aF6001 aAina, R.10aThiol-peptide level and proteomic changes in response to cadmium toxicity in Oryza sativa L. roots  ap. 381-392.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aIn the present study, rice seedlings were exposed to a range of Cd concentrations (0.1 μM, 1 μM, 10 μM, 100 μM and 1 mM) for 15 days and a combination of different molecular approaches were used to evidence Cd effects and to assess the plants' ability to counteract metal toxicity. At a macroscopical level, only the highest Cd concentration (1 mM) caused a complete plant growth inhibition, whereas the lowest concentrations seemed to stimulate growth. At genome level, the amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) technique was applied to detect DNA sequence changes in root cells, showing that all the Cd concentrations induced significant DNA polymorphisms in a dose-dependent manner. Data also evidenced the absence of preferential mutation sites. Plant responses were analysed by measuring the levels of gluthatione (GSH) and phytochelatins (PCs), the thiol-peptides involved in heavy metal tolerance mechanisms. Results showed a progressive increase of GSH up to 10 μM of Cd treatment, whereas a significant induction only of PC3 was detected in roots of plants exposed to 100 μM of Cd. As suggested by the proteome analysis of root tissues, this last concentration strongly induced the expression of regulatory proteins and some metabolic enzymes. Furthermore, the treatment with 10 μM of Cd induced changes in metabolic enzymes, but it mainly activated defence mechanisms by the induction of transporters and proteins involved in the degradation of oxidatively modified proteins. 3aplant growth 3arice 3aproteome 3aapplication rate 3aamplified fragment length polymorphism 3athiols 3aphytotoxicity 3adose response 3aOryza sativa 3aheavy metals 3aseedlings 3aglutathione 3acadmium 3aresistance mechanisms 3aphytochelatins 3aproteomics 3aroots 0apeptides1 aLabra, M.1 aFumagalli, P.1 aVannini, C.1 aMarsoni, M.1 aCucchi, U.1 aBracale, M.1 aSgorbati, S.1 aCitterio, S.0 tEnvironmental and experimental botany.g2007 Apr., v. 59, no. 3 p.381-392dPergamon Pressx0098-84727nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envexpbot.2006.04.0103Available from publisher's Web site  a20070820b20070902c00000000  aINDd2CTe2007/08/03  aNon-US 7aarticle01780naa a2200373 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024001800097040001800115100001700133245010300150300001600253500020000269500001500469520054200484650001901026650001701045650001801062650001001080650001501090650001001105650001201115650004501127650006201172653000901234653001101243773007701254852000901331939003301340945000801373946001301381655001201394991618520210742620221121055626.0880428e198707  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI880004272DNAL7 a28198522pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJacobs, L.R.10aEffect of dietary fiber on colonic cell proliferation and its relationship to colon carcinogenesis  ap. 566-571.  aPresented at the "Workshop on new developments on dietary fat and fiber in carcinogenesis (optimal types or amounts of fat or fiber)," American Health Foundation, March 25-26, 1986, New York, NY.  a2019-12-04  aA brief technical review discusses recent animal and human cell in vitro studies, noting the stimulation of large bowel cell proliferation (especially in the proximal colon) by wheat bran, pectin, guar gum, and degraded carageenan, but not by insoluble fiber (cellulose), oat bran, or inert bulking agents (kaolin).

Data were obtained on the sorption and desorption of radionuclides on the adaxial surfaces of fully expanded bean leaves by exposing them to ionic forms of caesium (Cs+), iodine (I-) or sulphur (SO4(2-)) over a six order of magnitude concentration range. The accumulation of each element was determined as a time course over a 48 h period using radioactive labels (137Cs, 125I or 35S, respectively). Time- and concentration-dependent sorption of each element to the leaf surface was analysed to determine: (a) the leaf surface-solution distribution coefficient (K(d)) at equilibrium and (b) the sorption and desorption rate coefficients for each element over the range of concentrations investigated. It was expected that Cs+ would show a stronger tendency to sorb to the leaf surface than both I- and SO4(2-) because of the cation exchange properties of the cuticular membrane. The K(d) for Cs+ was approximately 90x greater than that for SO4(2-) but 5x less than that for I-. This is thought to be due to either (a) the highly organophilic nature of iodide and the relatively high iodine number of cuticular waxes on plant leaf surfaces or (b) the possible oxidation of I- to I(0) or I(O)3-, with consequently enhanced leaf surface sorption. Based on data obtained in this study, ranges and best estimates of sorption and desorption rate coefficients are presented for Cs+, I- and SO4(2-) for use in modelling the interception of radioactive Cs, I- and S in rainfall by crops. 3aVicia faba 3afaba beans 3acesium 3aiodine 3asulfur 3asorption 3aleaves 3asurface interactions 3acanopy 3aradionuclides 3arain 3adesorption 3atemporal variation 3acation exchange capacity 3acell membranes 3aplant cuticle 3aepicuticular wax 3asimulation models1 aScott, L.K.1 aKinnersley, R.P.0 tEnvironmental and experimental botany.g2007 Apr., v. 59, no. 3 p.361-370dPergamon Pressx0098-84727nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envexpbot.2006.04.0083Available from publisher's Web site  a20070821b20070902c00000000  aINDd2CTe2007/08/03  aNon-US 7aarticle03172naa a2200697 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100001400171245010800185300001800293520111200311650001501423650002101438650001101459650001301470650001801483650001601501650001101517650001501528650001701543650001001560650002401570650001001594650000901604650001401613650001001627650001101637650001201648650001201660650003301672650004801705650003101753650002401784650001301808650007501821650004601896650002101942650002101963650003101984650003402015650000902049650002402058650001202082650001002094650002902104650002402133700001602157700002102173700001902194773009102213852000902304856009202313930003302405945001302438946001102451655001202462IND2268223820221121035303.0010406e200012  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND226822382DNAL7 a111234782pmid7 a10.1046/j.1365-2672.2000.01211.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChart, H.13aAn investigation into the pathogenic properties of Escherichia coli strains BLR, BL21, DH5alpha and EQ1  ap. 1048-1058.  aAims: To examine Escherichia coli strains EQ1, DH5alpha, BLR and BL21 for known pathogenic mechanisms. Methods and Results: Using specific DNA probes, the strains were shown not to carry the genes encoding invasion, various adhesion phenotypes or expression of a range of enterotoxins. The strains were unable to express long-chain lipopolysaccharide and were susceptible to the effects of serum complement. Using a BALB/c mouse model, the strains were shown to be unable to survive in selected tissues or to persist in the mouse gut. Using a chick model, strains EQ1, BLR and BL21 invaded livers but not spleens; only strain EQ1 persisted in the chick gut. In Merino sheep, only strain EQ1 was detected 6 d post-infection. Conclusions: Escherichia coli strains EQ1, DH5alpha, BLR and BL21 did not carry the well-recognized pathogenic mechanisms required by strains of E. coli causing the majority of enteric infections. Significance and Impact of the Study: Escherichia coli strains EQ1, DH5alpha, BLR and BL21 were considered to be non-pathogenic and unlikely to survive in host tissues and cause disease. 3aDNA probes 3aEscherichia coli 3aMerino 3aadhesion 3aanimal models 3ablood serum 3achicks 3acomplement 3aenterotoxins 3agenes 3alipopolysaccharides 3aliver 3amice 3aphenotype 3asheep 3aspleen 3atissues 2aAnimals 2aBacterial Adhesionxgenetics 2aBacterial Outer Membrane Proteinsxanalysis 2aBacterial Toxinsxgenetics 2aBloodxmicrobiology 2aChickens 2aEscherichia colixgeneticsxmetabolismxpathogenicityxultrastructure. 2aEscherichia coli Infectionsxmicrobiology 2aGenes, Bacterial 2aHemagglutination 2aHydrogen-Ion Concentration 2aLipopolysaccharidesxanalysis 2aMice 2aMice, Inbred BALB C 2aRabbits 2aSheep 2aSiderophoresxmetabolism 2aVirulencexgenetics1 aSmith, H.R.1 aLa Ragione, R.M.1 aWoodward, M.J.0 tJournal of applied microbiology.g2000 Dec., v. 89, no. 6 p.1048-1058x1364-50727nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2672.2000.01211.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20010601b20010612c00000000  aINDdGK1  aNon-US 7aarticle03407naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001900152245007400171300001600245520182000261650001202081650001102093650001702104650002902121650002202150650001202172650001602184650001602200650002202216650001402238650001502252650001602267650001402283650002402297650001302321650001402334650001502348650001702363650001202380650002502392650001302417650001402430650001402444650001402458650001402472653002302486700002302509700001902532700001602551773011702567852000902684856009202693930003302785946001102818655001202829IND4435475920221121025631.0100416e201004  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443547592DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2109.2009.02375.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHamre, Kristin10aRoles of lipid-soluble vitamins during ontogeny of marine fish larvae  ap. 745-750.  aThe roles of lipid-soluble vitamins during ontogeny of marine fish larvae are a subject topic where only fragments of the whole picture are known. Most of the research has been focussed on the larval requirements and the availability of these vitamins in the live feed organisms used for early-stage larvae, while the function of the vitamins in the larvae themselves is largely unknown. Our knowledge is mostly extrapolated from research on other vertebrates and also in part from juvenile and adult fish. Vitamin A is known to be essential for establishing body and organ axes in vertebrate embryos and interacts with other nutrients such as vitamin D and fatty acids through the steroid/thyroid nuclear hormone receptor family. In marine fish larvae, excess vitamin A stimulates pigmentation, but at the same time induces vertebral deformities. Live feed organisms contain very little vitamin A but marine fish larvae appear to convert carotenoids in Artemia and copepods to vitamin A, while rotifers, which contain little carotenoids, should be enriched with vitamin A. Vitamin E acts as an antioxidant and is important for the protection of marine fish larvae against the oxidation pressure probably present in intensive rearing systems. Vitamin E may also have other roles connected to its modulation of cell and tissue red-ox balance. In marine fish larvae and juveniles, vitamin E has been shown to enhance the symptoms of vitamin C deficiency, while protecting against the oxidative effect of n-3 fatty acids. Vitamin D is important for the modulation of calcium and phosphorus homeostasis and for the development of the vertebrate skeleton. Vitamin K influences bone development and coagulation of the blood. There is little information on vitamins D and K connected to the ontogeny of marine fish larvae. 3aArtemia 3aadults 3aantioxidants 3aascorbic acid deficiency 3ablood coagulation 3acalcium 3afish larvae 3ahomeostasis 3ahormone receptors 3ajuveniles 3alive feeds 3amarine fish 3anutrients 3aomega-3 fatty acids 3aontogeny 3aoxidation 3aphosphorus 3apigmentation 3arearing 3askeletal development 3askeleton 3avitamin A 3avitamin D 3avitamin E 3avitamin K 0amarine fish larvae1 aKrossøy, Christel1 aLock, Erik-Jan1 aMoren, Mari0 tAquaculture research.g2010 Apr., v. 41, no. 5 p.745-750dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx1355-557X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2109.2009.02375.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20100416b20100501c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02876naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100001600171245009800187300001600285520116700301650002301468650002201491650004401513650002501557650001801582650002601600650002201626650001001648650003001658650001801688650002501706650005601731650003601787650001401823650004901837650008001886650003401966650003402000653002502034700001702059700001702076700001802093773008902111852000902200856009202209930003302301945001302334946001102347655001202358IND2321318820221121025535.0010604e200103  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232131882DNAL7 a112982372pmid7 a10.1046/j.1365-2672.2001.01262.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCoppola, S.10aMolecular evaluation of microbial diversity occurring in different types of Mozzarella cheese  ap. 414-420.  aAims: The microbial community of different types of unripened Pasta Filata cheese was investigated by culture-independent methods with the aim of rapidly achieving knowledge about cheese microbiota and discriminating traditional and industrial cheeses. Methods and Results: The microbial DNA extracted directly from the samples was used as a template in PCR experiments to amplify the 16S-23S rDNA spacer region and the V3 region of the 16S rDNA. Conventional electrophoresis of the amplified spacers allowed known classes of these DNA fragments belonging to genera and species of lactic acid bacteria to be distinguished. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis analysis of V3 amplicons was supported by reference cultures of LAB used as markers. Conclusions: Both molecular approaches furnished the expected information about microbial diversity and were quite valid for discriminating industrial, semi-artisanal or traditional cheeses, characterized by increasingly complex DNA profiles. Significance and Impact of the Study: Both methods could be used for legal purposes when products obtained through prescribed manufacturing regulations are to be analysed. 3aDNA fingerprinting 3aDNA fragmentation 3adenaturing gradient gel electrophoresis 3alactic acid bacteria 3amanufacturing 3amicrobial communities 3amozzarella cheese 3apasta 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aribosomal DNA 2aCheesexmicrobiology 2aDNA, Bacterialxanalysisxisolation & purification. 2aDNA, Ribosomal Spacerxgenetics 2aEcosystem 2aElectrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gelxmethods 2aGram-Positive Bacteriaxclassificationxgeneticsxisolation & purification. 2aRNA, Ribosomal, 16Sxgenetics 2aRNA, Ribosomal, 23Sxgenetics 0apasta filata cheeses1 aBlaiotta, G.1 aErcolini, D.1 aMoschetti, G.0 tJournal of applied microbiology.g2001 Mar., v. 90, no. 3 p.414-420x1364-50727nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2672.2001.01262.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20010702b20010710c00000000  aINDdGK1  aNon-US 7aarticle03006naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100001500171245011600186300001600302520142300318650001001741650002501751650002001776650001801796650002301814650002401837650001201861650001301873650001601886650001901902650002001921650001201941650001401953650005001967650001802017650004002035650003602075650004902111650003402160700001902194700001402213700001402227773008902241852000902330856009202339930003302431945001302464946001102477655001202488IND2321322020221121012040.0010604e200103  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232132202DNAL7 a112982452pmid7 a10.1046/j.1365-2672.2001.01269.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSoussi, M.10aEffects of salinity on protein and lipopolysaccharide pattern in a salt-tolerant strain of Mesorhizobium ciceri  ap. 476-481.  aAims: To characterize the physiological and metabolic responses of Mesorhizobium ciceri strain ch-191 to salt stress, investigating the changes induced by salinity in protein and lipopolysaccharide profiles, as well as determining the accumulation of amino acids, glutamate and proline. Methods and Results: Strain ch-191 of M. ciceri was grown with different NaCl concentrations. Protein and lipopolysaccharide patterns were determined by electrophoresis. The strain ch-191 tolerated up to 200 mmol l-1 NaCl, although higher salt dosages limited its growth and induced changes in the protein profile. The most noteworthy change in the LPS-I pattern was the decrease in the slowest band and the appearance of an intermediate mobility band. The accumulation of proline in response to salt stress surpassed that of glutamate. Conclusions: The protein profile showed major alterations at salinity levels which inhibited growth. However, the alterations in the LPS profile and accumulation of compatible solutes were evident from the lowest levels, suggesting that these changes may constitute adaptative responses to salt, allowing normal growth. Significance and Impact of the Study: The selection and characterization of salt-tolerant strains, which also show efficient symbiotic performance under salinity, may constitute a strategy for improving Cicer arietinum-Mesorhizobium ciceri symbiosis in adverse environments. 3aCicer 3aMesorhizobium ciceri 3aelectrophoresis 3aglutamic acid 3agrowth retardation 3alipopolysaccharides 3aproline 3asalinity 3asalt stress 3asalt tolerance 3asodium chloride 3asolutes 3asymbiosis 2aBacterial Proteinsxdrug effectsxmetabolism. 2aCulture Media 2aElectrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel 2aLipopolysaccharidesxmetabolism 2aRhizobiumxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aSodium Chloridexpharmacology1 aSantamaria, M.1 aOcana, A.1 aLluch, C.0 tJournal of applied microbiology.g2001 Mar., v. 90, no. 3 p.476-481x1364-50727nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2672.2001.01269.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20010702b20010710c00000000  aINDdGK1  aNon-US 7aarticle01779naa a2200349 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024001800097040001800115100001600133245004500149300001300194520078300207650001500990650002401005650000901029650001101038650001101049650004801060650004001108650005801148653003701206653002601243700001401269773007101283852000901354939003301363945000801396946001301404655001201417991618516370742620221121012344.0880420e19850615xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI880001722DNAL7 a28613522pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrush, M.G.10aPyridoxine and the premenstrual syndrome  ap. 1399.  aA brief report critiques a recent letter to the editor that alleged ill-effects were associated with high serum vitamin B6 levels, due to the substantial concern this raises for the many women who use vitamin B6.

For the latter case, inherent PAI-2 mRNA instability was previously shown to require a nonameric adenylate-uridylate element in the 3′ UTR. However, mutation of this site was only partially effective at restoring complete mRNA stabilization. In the present study, we have identified additional regulatory motifs within the 3′ UTR that cooperate with the nonameric adenylate-uridylate element to promote mRNA destabilization. These elements are located within a 74 nucleotide U-rich stretch (58%) of the 3′ UTR that flanks the nonameric motif; deletion or substitution of this entire region results in complete mRNA stabilization. These new elements are conserved between species and optimize the destabilizing capacity with the nonameric element to ensure complete mRNA instability in a manner analogous to some class I and II adenylate-uridylate elements present in transcripts encoding oncogenes and cytokines. Hence, post-transcriptional regulation of the PAI-2 mRNA transcript involves an interaction between closely spaced adenylate-uridylate elements in a manner analogous to the post-transcriptional regulation of oncogenes and cytokines. 3acytokines 3amessenger RNA 3amutation 3aoncogenes 3aplasminogen activator inhibitors 3atranscription (genetics) 0a3′ untranslated region 0aadenylate and uridylate-rich element 0amRNA decay 0aplasminogen activator inhibitor type 21 aMariasegaram, Mythily1 aGafforini, Chris1 aNagamine, Yoshikuni1 aMedcalf, Robert L.0 tFEBS journal.g2010 Mar., v. 277, no. 5 p.1331-1344dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx1742-464X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1742-4658.2010.07563.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20100220b20100305c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02626naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002000164245010300184300001600287520116500303650002101468650002901489650001701518650001901535650001101554650001501565650001601580650001401596650001201610650001101622650001401633650003301647650002401680650002401704650004101728650002501769650002801794653001201822700002501834700002401859700001601883773009501899852000901994856008502003930003302088946001102121655001202132IND4439155520221120231603.0100625e201007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443915552DNAL7 a200914132pmid7 a10.1007/s00726-010-0477-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFlynn, Nick E. 10aGlycine oxidation and conversion into amino acids in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Candida albicans  ap. 605-608.  aHumans are exposed much more often to exogenous Saccharomyces cerevisiae (a baker's yeast) than exogenous Candida albicans (a highly infectious yeast) but suffer no apparent complications from S. cerevisiae. We hypothesize that variations in characteristics between these two species may be due, in part, to differences in glycine metabolism. In this study, we examined differences in glycine oxidation between C. albicans and S. cerevisiae. Both C. albicans and S. cerevisiae were cultured in glycine enriched media, followed by determination of glycine oxidation and amino acid concentrations in cells. Glycine was degraded to a much greater extent in C. albicans than in S. cerevisiae. Threonine concentrations and glycine oxidation were also elevated in C. albicans. Almost all of the disappearance of glycine from incubation media was accounted for by the formation of serine, threonine, and CO₂ in S. cerevisiae, whereas these products represented only 50% of the metabolized glycine in C. albicans. The unidentified metabolites of glycine in C. albicans, presumably purines, could contribute to its infectious capacity and this warrants further study. 3aCandida albicans 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3abakers yeast 3acarbon dioxide 3ahumans 3ametabolism 3ametabolites 3aoxidation 3apurines 3aserine 3athreonine 2aCandida albicansxmetabolism 2aGlycinexmetabolism 2aOxidation-Reduction 2aSaccharomyces cerevisiaexmetabolism 2aSerinexbiosynthesis 2aThreoninexbiosynthesis 0aGlycine1 aPatyrak, Michael E. 1 aSeely, Jeremiah B. 1 aWu, Guoyao 0 tAmino acids.g2010 July, v. 39, no. 2 p.605-608dVienna : Springer Viennax0939-44517nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00726-010-0477-73Available from publisher's Web site  a20100628b20100703c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02441naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100002000171245008500191300001400276500001500290520111200305650001701417650002601434650002401460650001101484650001501495650001201510650002701522650001401549650002901563650002701592650002701619650002301646653001101669653001001680653001401690700002601704773012001730852000901850856009201859930003301951946001101984655001201995IND4437993920221120221340.0100604e201007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443799392DNAL7 a204027762pmid7 a10.1111/j.1574-6941.2010.00862.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOlson, Julie B.10aMicrobial ecology of corals, sponges, and algae in mesophotic coral environments  ap. 17-30.  a2019-12-04  aMesophotic coral ecosystems that occur at depths from 30 to 200 m have historically been understudied and yet appear to support a diverse biological community. The microbiology of these systems is particularly poorly understood, especially with regard to the communities associated with corals, sponges, and algae. This lack of information is partly due to the problems associated with gaining access to these environments and poor reproducibility across sampling methods. To summarize what is known about the microbiology of these ecosystems and to highlight areas where research is urgently needed, an overview of the current state of knowledge is presented. Emphasis is placed on the characterization of microbial populations, both prokaryotic and eukaryotic, associated with corals, sponges, and algae and the factors that influence microbial community structure. In topic areas where virtually nothing is known from mesophotic environments, the knowledge pertaining to shallow-water ecosystems is summarized to provide a starting point for a discussion on what might be expected in the mesophotic zone. 3amicrobiology 3amicrobial communities 3acommunity structure 3acorals 3aecosystems 2aAnimals 2aAnthozoaxmicrobiology 2aEcosystem 2aEukaryotaxmicrobiology. 2aPoriferaxmicrobiology 2aSeawaterxmicrobiology 2aWater Microbiology 0amarine 0aAlgae 0alow-light1 aKellogg, Christina A.0 tFEMS microbiology ecology.g2010 July, v. 73, no. 1 p.17-30dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0168-64967nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1574-6941.2010.00862.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20100604b20100703c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01767naa a2200409 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024001800097040001800115100001600133245007700149300001800226520058700244650002400831650001500855650002400870650001200894650003200906650003100938650001100969650002900980650003601009650003201045651001501077653002801092653001301120700001501133700001601148773010501164852001301269939003301282945000801315946001301323852000901336655001201345991618514070742620221120221429.0880519e198711  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI880008792DNAL7 a36681332pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWalsh, J.H.10aFactors affecting nutrition training in four family practice residencies  ap. 1558-1560.  aA study assessed factors influencing nutrition education of physicians in 4 family practice residencies in California.

When the aphid's immune system is challenged with bacterial antigens and a fungal pathogen, neither immune challenge alters wing development, indicating that perhaps there is no redirection by the aphid of resources required for wing development to cover possible costs of mounting an immune response. 3aAphidoidea 3aHymenoptera 3abacterial antigens 3afungal antigens 3aimmune response 3aimmune system 3aparasitism 3aparasitoids 3apathogens 3awings 0awing development1 aHardie, Jim.0 tPhysiological entomology.g2010 Mar., v. 35, no. 1 p.82-86dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0307-69627nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-3032.2009.00703.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20100213b20100305c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02483naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131100002300149245006000172300001500232500002400247500001500271520146600286650002401752650002401776650001901800650001301819650001101832650002301843650001501866650002201881650001801903650001601921653001501937773010801952852000902060856005202069655001202121IND4463216720221120161924.0120514e200301  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446321672DNAL7 a10.1016/S0925-5214(02)00184-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSaltveit, Mikal E.10aIs it possible to find an optimal controlled atmosphere  ap. 3–13.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aEvery controlled atmosphere (CA) conference has included recommendations for controlled atmospheres that purport to produce the optimal storage atmosphere for specific horticultural crops. However, the natural variability in the raw material and its dynamic response to processing and storage conditions may render it impossible to identify a truly optimal storage atmosphere. Additional refinements in recommendations for the CA and modified atmosphere (MA) storage of fruits and vegetables will continue to accrue through empirical observations derived from traditional experiments in which the six components of the storage environment (i.e. duration, temperature, relative humidity, O2, CO2 and ethylene levels) are varied in well-defined steps. However, the variability inherent in biological systems and the often dynamic response of the stored commodities to changes in their storage environment may not be adequately accounted for in these types of static experiments where all variables are usually held constant for the duration of the experiment. Truly significant advances in the use of CA and MA may require the development of mathematical models that incorporate some measure of the commodity's dynamic response to the storage environment. These measurements should reflect the commodity's changing response to various storage parameters (e.g. a shifting anaerobic compensation point), and should be useful in predicting future changes in quality. 3ahorticultural crops 3amathematical models 3acarbon dioxide 3aethylene 3afruits 3astorage conditions 3avegetables 3arelative humidity 3araw materials 3atemperature 0aatmosphere0 tPostharvest biology and technology.g2003 Jan., v. 27, no. 1 p.3–13-3–13dElsevierx0925-52147nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0925-5214(02)00184-9 7aarticle04272naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002100145245013100166300001600297520262900313650001502942650002102957650001502978650001202993650000903005650002003014650001603034650002303050650001703073650000903090650000903099650001603108650000703124650001203131650002103143650001703164650001603181650001003197650001403207650001003221650001703231650001303248650001603261650001903277651001003296651001203306653001603318653002103334653001603355700001803371700001803389773012503407852000903532856008503541930003303626946001103659655001203670IND4438848820221120152040.0100619e201007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443884882DNAL7 a10.1007/s11368-010-0213-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhong, Shunqing 10aInfluence of iron plaque on accumulation of lead by yellow flag (Iris pseudacorus L.) grown in artificial Pb-contaminated soil  ap. 964-970.  aPurpose The relationship between plant absorption and accumulation of heavy metals and the effect of iron plaque on roots of wetland plants are unknown, especially for plants grown in heavy metal-contaminated soil. This experiment was designed to study the effects of iron addition on the formation of iron plaque in the rhizosphere of the wetland plant species Iris pseudacorus L. in artificial Pb-contaminated soil and the effects of iron plaque on Pb accumulation by plants. Materials and methods Soil was collected from 0- to 30-cm depth of a clayey illitic thermic typic epiaqualfs in an abandoned paddy field in Jiaxing of Zhejiang Province, China. The seeds of yellow flag (I. pseudacorus L.) were germinated in soil mixed with vermiculite and grown for 30 days. Three treatments of iron (0, 100, and 500 mg Fe kg⁻¹ as FeSO₄) were added when uniform seedlings were transplanted into plastic pots filled with 1.0-kg soil, which had been previously treated with four treatments of Pb [0, 100, 500, and 1,000 mg Pb kg⁻¹ as Pb(NO₃)₂] and waterlogged for 72 days. The yellow flags were grown in a greenhouse for 60 days. The plaque on roots was extracted using the cold DCB (dithionite-citrate-bicarbonate) technique. The plant samples were digested with 10 mL concentrated nitric acid by microwave digestion. The concentration of Fe and Pb were determined using atomic spectrophotometry (NovAA300, Germany). Results and discussion The amount of iron plaque on the roots of yellow flag (I. pseudacorus L.) was markedly affected by Fe addition but not by Pb addition. The total Pb accumulated in plants was increased initially and then decreased with the addition of Fe in three lower Pb treatments (0, 100, and 500 mg Pb kg⁻¹) but decreased with more Fe addition in the 1,000 mg Pb kg⁻¹ treatment. The pH value was decreased with the addition of more iron, which increases Pb availability, and heavy doses of iron caused iron toxicity. Plant growth decreased due to iron toxicity at higher iron additions (500 mg kg⁻¹), while Pb accumulation decreased. Intermediate levels of iron supply (100 mg kg⁻¹) enhanced Pb absorption in roots, which improved phytoremediation effectiveness. Conclusions Iron supply enhanced the amount of iron plaque and increased both Pb adsorbed on the roots and Pb uptake by plants. However, plant growth was inhibited by iron toxicity at high iron dose (500 mg kg⁻¹) and biomass decreased. The intermediate iron dose (100 mg kg⁻¹) generally enhanced Pb absorption and accumulation, which enhances the ability of yellow flag to remove Pb from Pb-contaminated soils. 3aEpiaqualfs 3aIris pseudacorus 3aabsorption 3abiomass 3acold 3aferrous sulfate 3agreenhouses 3agrowth retardation 3aheavy metals 3airon 3alead 3anitric acid 3apH 3apaddies 3aphytoremediation 3aplant growth 3arhizosphere 3aroots 3aseedlings 3aseeds 3aspectroscopy 3atoxicity 3avermiculite 3awetland plants 3aChina 3aGermany 0aIron plaque 0aWaterlogged soil 0aYellow flag1 aShi, Jiachun 1 aXu, Jianming 0 tJournal of soils and sediments.g2010 July, v. 10, no. 5 p.964-970dBerlin/Heidelberg : Springer-Verlagx1439-01087nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11368-010-0213-73Available from publisher's Web site  a20100619b20100703c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03308naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001900164245012600183300001600309500002400325520150300349650001201852650001301864650002101877650001101898650001501909650001701924650002001941650002001961650001001981650001601991650001302007650001002020650001802030650001502048650001002063650005702073650006302130650003502193650001902228650005802247650003502305650007702340650004602417650006502463650002002528650002202548650004202570773008502612852000902697856004802706655001202754IND4426171720221120141651.0090918e200910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442617172DNAL7 a196850812pmid7 a10.1007/s00442-009-1433-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBaldrian, Petr10aEctomycorrhizal fungi and their enzymes in soils: is there enough evidence for their role as facultative soil saprotrophs  ap. 657-660.  aIncludes references  aAlthough ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungi are generally regarded as dependent upon the supply of carbon from their plant hosts, some recent papers have postulated a role for these fungi in the saprotrophic acquisition of carbon from soil. This theory was mainly based on the increase in enzymatic activity during periods of low photosynthate supply from tree hosts and emergence of the theory has led to a question about the overall influence of saprotrophy by ECM fungi on soil carbon turnover. However, I argue here that there is still not enough evidence to confirm this proposed function. My argument is based on inference from several lines of observation and concern over several aspects of the past studies. First, ECM fungi mainly inhabit deeper soil horizons, in which the availability of carbon compounds with positive energetic value is low. Second, the ability of ECM fungi to produce ligninolytic enzymes and cellulases is much weaker than that of saprotrophic basidiomycetes. This is most apparent in the low copy abundance of corresponding genes in the sequenced genomes of ECM species Laccaria bicolor and Amanita bisporigenes compared to the saprotrophic species Galerina marginata. I offer alternative hypotheses to explain the past observations of increased enzyme activity during starvation periods. These include, the induction of autolytic processes in ECM fungal mycelia or an attack on the host tissues to support escape from a dying root and to allow for a search for new hosts. 3aAmanita 3aGalerina 3aLaccaria bicolor 3acarbon 3acellulases 3adetritivores 3aectomycorrhizae 3aenzyme activity 3agenes 3ahost plants 3amycelium 3aroots 3asoil horizons 3astarvation 3atrees 2aAmanitaxenzymologyxgeneticsxgrowth & development. 2aBasidiomycotaxenzymologyxgeneticsxgrowth & development. 2aCarbonxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aGenome, Fungal 2aLaccariaxenzymologyxgeneticsxgrowth & development. 2aLigninxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aMycorrhizaexclassificationxenzymologyxgeneticsxgrowth & development. 2aOrganic Chemicalsxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aPlant Rootsxenzymologyxgrowth & developmentxmicrobiology. 2aSoilxanalysis. 2aSoil Microbiology 2aStarvationxenzymologyxmicrobiology.0 tOecologia.g2009 Oct., v. 161, no. 4 p.657-660dSpringer-Verlagx0029-85497nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00442-009-1433-7 7aarticle02260naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131100002100149245013600170300001400306520102000320650001701340650001701357650002101374650002401395650001201419650001501431650001401446650001601460650001101476650001101487650001201498650002601510650001301536651001401549700002601563700002601589773008101615852000901696856008901705939003301794946001101827655001201838IND4480314720221120130154.0140425s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448031472DNAL7 a10.1080/14728028.2011.97566952doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTherville, Clara10aFarmers' perspectives about agroforests conversion to plantations in sumatra. Lessons learnt from Bungo District (Jambi, Indonesia)  ap. 15-33.  aLocated on the fringe of the last tropical rainforests of Sumatra, rubber agroforests are known to conserve the main ecological functions of the primary forest, including a large part of its biodiversity. Nowadays these smallholder plantations are under threat. The regular rise of natural rubber and crude palm oil prices has been a major incentive for farmers to convert their agroforests into clonal rubber and oil-palm plantations. However, some areas seem to resist conversion. A multidisciplinary approach combining perception surveys and satellite-image analysis was designed to find out the reasons for these differences. In 12 villages grouped in 3 categories according to their agroforest conversion rate between 1993 and 2005, farmers were queried about the pros and the cons of the major cropping systems, their attitude towards conservation, and how they envisaged the future of their landscape. This method enabled us to elaborate the most likely scenarios of landscape evolution for the coming years. 3aagroforestry 3abiodiversity 3acropping systems 3aecological function 3afarmers 3alandscapes 3apalm oils 3aplantations 3aprices 3arubber 3asurveys 3atropical rain forests 3avillages 3aIndonesia1 aFeintrenie, Laurène.1 aLevang, P.q(Patrice)0 tForests, trees and livelihoods.g2010, v. 20, no. 1 p.15-33x1472-80287nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14728028.2011.97566953Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b00000000c20140425  aNon-US 7aarticle03285naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002700164245016700191300001600358500002400374520157900398650001801977650001501995650002502010650001002035650002202045650001502067650003302082650002002115650001802135650002002153650001202173650003702185650005602222650001402278650001502292650004902307650002802356650002602384651000902410651000902419700002202428700002102450700003902471700002102510700002102531700002202552773011202574852000902686856004802695655001202743IND4422456120221120120734.0090626e200908  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442245612DNAL7 a191844682pmid7 a10.1007/s10493-009-9241-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKhalili Mahani, Marjan10aGenetic variation in populations of Allothrombium pulvinum (Acari: Trombidiidae) from Northern Iran revealed by mitochondrial coxI and nuclear rDNA ITS2 sequences  ap. 273-289.  aIncludes references  aAllothrombium pulvinum Ewing is a common natural enemy of aphids and some other arthropods. So far, there are no studies that have addressed genetic variation of this predatory mite. We investigated genetic variation of A. pulvinum across its whole known range in Iran. A 410 bp portion of the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I gene (coxI) and 797-802 bp portion of the internal transcribed spacer 2 of rDNA (ITS2) were sequenced for 55 individuals from 11 populations, resulting in 12 and 26 haplotypes, respectively. In the coxI region, haplotype and nucleotide diversities varied among populations from 0.00 to 0.90 and from 0.0000 to 0.0110, respectively. In the ITS2 region they varied from 0.20 to 0.91 and from 0.0006 to 0.0023, respectively. For both gene regions the highest haplotype and nucleotide diversities were detected in population Mahmoud Abad from northern Iran. Statistically significant population differentiation (F ST) was detected in most pair-wise population comparisons. The results of population differentiation for both gene regions were generally congruent indicating that A. pulvinum from Iran consists of genetically different populations. This suggests that A. pulvinum comprises at least two geographically distinct populations or even more than one species. This study is an initial step towards understanding genetic variation of A. pulvinum, a taxon for which little molecular information is available. More intensive sampling and analysis of additional DNA regions are necessary for more detailed classification of this taxon. 3aAllothrombium 3aAphidoidea 3acytochrome-c oxidase 3agenes 3agenetic variation 3ahaplotypes 3ainternal transcribed spacers 3apredatory mites 3aribosomal DNA 2aAcarixgenetics 2aAnimals 2aDNA, Ribosomal Spacerxchemistry 2aElectron Transport Complex IVxchemistryxgenetics. 2aGeography 2aHaplotypes 2aMitochondrial Proteinsxchemistryxgenetics. 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPolymorphism, Genetic 3aIran 0aIran1 aInomata, Nobuyuki1 aSaboori, Alireza1 aSayed Tabatabaei, Baraldin Ebrahim1 aIshiyama, Hiroko1 aAriana, Ardeshir1 aSzmidt, Alfred E.0 tExperimental & applied acarology.g2009 Aug., v. 48, no. 4 p.273-289dSpringer Netherlandsx0168-81627nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10493-009-9241-7 7aarticle02758naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100001700171245012300188300001600311520115600327650003001483650001201513650001901525650001501544650002501559650000701584650001201591650002601603650001601629650001301645650002001658650001601678650007001694650002501764650003201789650003101821650003401852650001601886700001601902700001701918700001401935700001801949700001401967773008901981852000902070856009202079930003302171945001302204946001102217655001202228IND2321320120221120110004.0010604e200103  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232132012DNAL7 a112982412pmid7 a10.1046/j.1365-2672.2001.01264.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGobbetti, M.10aPurification and characterization of an extracellular proline iminopeptidase from Corynebacterium variabilis NCDO 2101  ap. 449-456.  aAims: To screen the extracellular proteolytic and lipolytic activities of Corynebacterium variabilis NCDO 2101 and to purify and characterize a proline iminopeptidase enzyme in order to investigate the role of the major component of the smear of bacterial surface-ripened cheeses. Methods and Results: Four chromatographic steps were used to purify the enzyme and a three-factor, five-level Central Composite Design was used to study the interactive effects of cheese-related values of pH, NaCl and temperature. The proline iminopeptidase showed some biochemical properties different from the same enzyme purified from lactic acid bacteria and other smear bacteria. It tolerated NaCl concentrations up to 7.5% and was sensitive to low values of pH especially when they were combined with low temperature. Conclusions: The proline iminopeptidase of C. variabilis NCDO 2101 may have a role in proteolysis during ripening of smear surface-ripened cheeses. Significance and Impact of the Study: The findings of this work contribute to the knowledge of the enzymology of smear bacteria in order to improve the ripening of bacterial surface-ripened cheeses. 3aCorynebacterium variabile 3acheeses 3achromatography 3aenzymology 3alactic acid bacteria 3apH 3aproline 3aprolyl aminopeptidase 3aproteolysis 3aripening 3asodium chloride 3atemperature 2aAminopeptidasesxchemistryxisolation & purificationxmetabolism. 2aCheesexmicrobiology 2aCorynebacteriumxenzymology 2aHydrogen-Ion Concentration 2aSodium Chloridexpharmacology 2aTemperature1 aSmacchi, E.1 aSemeraro, M.1 aFox, P.F.1 aLanciotti, R.1 aCogan, T.0 tJournal of applied microbiology.g2001 Mar., v. 90, no. 3 p.449-456x1364-50727nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2672.2001.01264.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20010702b20010710c00000000  aINDdGK1  aNon-US 7aarticle03657naa a2200733 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002000110040001800130100001400148245007700162300001800239500002400257506007600281520135100357506003701708650002001745650001301765650001401778650002601792650001501818650002101833650001301854650002001867650001001887650001501897650002601912650003701938650002201975650001101997650001802008650001702026650001002043650002502053650002502078650002002103650001502123650002402138650002302162650002202185650004002207650002302247650002302270650001502293650004902308650002802357650004202385650003402427650002602461650005502487653002302542653001702565653002802582700002602610773015302636852000902789856005402798930003302852945001302885946001302898655001202911IND2181115220221207115549.0981117e199804  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND218111522DNAL7 a95360652pmid7 aPMC350552pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCicek, M.10aStructure and expression of a dhurrinase (beta-glucosidase) from sorghum  ap. 1469-1478.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aSorghum (Sorghum bicolor L. Moench) has two isozymes of the cyanogenic Beta-glucosidase dhurrinase: dhurrinase-1 (Dhr1) and dhurrinase-2 (Dhr2). A nearly full-length cDNA encoding dhurrinase was isolated from 4-d-old etiolated seedlings and sequenced. The cDNA has a 1695-nucleotide-long open reading frame, which codes for a 565-amino acid-long precursor and a 514-amino acid-long mature protein, respectively. Deduced amino acid sequence of the sorghum Dhr showed 70% identity with two maize (Zea mays) Beta-glucosidase isozymes. Southern-blot data suggested that Beta-glucosidase is encoded by a small multigene family in sorghum. Northern-blot data indicated that the mRNA corresponding to the cloned Dhr cDNA is present at high levels in the node and upper half of the mesocotyl in etiolated seedlings but at low levels in the root--only in the zone of elongation and the tip region. Light-grown seedling parts had lower levels of Dhr mRNA than those of etiolated seedlings. Immunoblot analysis performed using maize-anti-Beta-glucosidase sera detected two distinct dhurrinases (57 and 62 kD) in sorghum. The distribution of Dhr activity in different plant parts supports the mRNA and immunoreactive protein data, suggesting that the cloned cDNA corresponds to the Dhr1 (57 kD) isozyme and that the dhr1 gene shows organ-specific expression.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aSorghum bicolor 3aZea mays 3aseedlings 3acyanogenic glycosides 3ahydrolysis 3abeta-glucosidase 3aisozymes 3aenzyme activity 3aroots 3amesocotyls 3aquantitative analysis 3agenetic techniques and protocols 3acomplementary DNA 3aclones 3amessenger RNA 3agenetic code 3agenes 3anucleotide sequences 3aamino acid sequences 3agene expression 3aetiolation 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aBlotting, Southern 2aBlotting, Western 2aEdible Grainxenzymologyxgenetics. 2aCloning, Molecular 2aDNA, Complementary 2aDNA, Plant 2aIsoenzymesxchemistryxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aRNA, Messengerxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aSequence Homology, Amino Acid 2aSubstrate Specificity 2abeta-Glucosidasexchemistryxgeneticsxmetabolism. 0agenetic regulation 0alocalization 0amolecular sequence data1 aJesens, A.q(Andrejs)0 tPlant physiology.g1998 Apr., v. 116, no. 4 p.1469-1478dAmerican Society of Plant PhysiologistsaPlant physiology (Lancaster, Pa.)x0032-08897nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.plantphysiol.org/3electronic resource  a20050129b20050130c00000000  aINDdMKS  aOther US 7aarticle01699naa a2200313 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097245002300115300001400138520089500152650001701047650002101064650000901085650002201094650001101116650002201127650001501149650002601164650002701190650001501217773007801232852000901310930003301319945000801352946001301360655001201373991618499050742620221120070001.0821019e198206  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI820012032DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL10aWe are what we eat  ap. 10,12.  aChanges in attitudes and behavior involving food preparation and consumption have resulted in more away-from-home eating (15% of all main meals, 25% of lunches), lower consumption of red meat, increased consumption of ethnic foods, increased in-home snacking, fewer dishes served per meal, increased use of the microwave oven, and decreased consumption of coffee but increased use of carbonated beverages and juices. Considering these trends, major changes are expected in the food industry. Mass marketers will present more products based on "good for you" themes, red meats will continue to decline, the in-home food market will continue to decline (due to the increased number of working women), product lines in fast food restaurants will increase, and the food industry will increase mergers and acquisitions.

Explains the overall purpose of this multi-disciplinary programme in social scientific terms the examination of the processes affecting human food choice. The programme's central concern--"why do people eat what they do?"--is amenable to study using a variety of social scientific research approaches, designs and techniques of data collection and analysis. Illustrates this methodological variety selectively in reporting a few of the programme's early results from three of its projects. The findings confirm that people eat what they do for a multiplicity of reasons in addition to, and sometimes in conflict with, hunger, properties of the food itself or people's own valuation of health and nutrition. 3adietary surveys 3aeating habits 3aUnited Kingdom 0aprograms 0adiet0 tBritish food journal.g1997, v. 99, no. 3/4 p.89-96dBritish Food JournalaBritish food journal (Croydon, England)x0007-070X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.emerald-library.com/3electronic resource  a20050224b20050301c00000000  aINDdLDP  aNon-US 7aarticle03314naa a2200661 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002300164245010200187300001400289520133500303650002001638650001201658650002101670650001501691650001501706650001401721650000901735650002301744650001601767650002301783650001701806650002201823650002001845650002701865650001801892650001501910650002101925650001201946650001101958650002501969650003301994650003102027650001502058650003302073650004002106650003302146650002002179650002202199651001502221651001502236653003002251653003102281653002002312653001702332700002502349700002502374773010302399852000902502856008502511930003302596946001102629655001202640IND4386571220221123030025.0070107e200702  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438657122DNAL7 a170243772pmid7 a10.1007/s00442-006-0566-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSpringer, Yuri P. 10aSoil calcium and plant disease in serpentine ecosystems: a test of the pathogen refuge hypothesis  ap. 10-21.  aEcologists have long sought mechanistic explanations for the patterns of plant distribution and endemism associated with serpentine soils. We conducted the first empirical test of the serpentine pathogen refuge hypothesis, which posits that the low levels of calcium found in serpentine soils provide associated plants with a refuge from attack by pathogens. We measured the range of soil calcium concentrations experienced by 16 wild population of California dwarf flax (Hesperolinon californicum) and experimentally recreated part of this range in the greenhouse by soaking serpentine soils in calcium chloride solutions of varying molarity. When flax plants grown in these soils were inoculated with spores of the rust fungus Melampsora lini we found a significant negative relationship between infection rates and soil calcium concentrations. This result refutes the pathogen refuge hypothesis and suggests that serpentine plants, by virtue of their association with low calcium soils, may be highly vulnerable to attack by pathogens. This interaction between plant nutrition and disease may in part explain demographic patterns associated with serpentine plant populations and suggests scenarios for the evolution of life history traits and the distribution of genetic resistance to infection in serpentine plant communities. 3aMelampsora lini 3acalcium 3acalcium chloride 3aecologists 3aecosystems 3aevolution 3aflax 3agenetic resistance 3agreenhouses 3aindigenous species 3alife history 3aplant communities 3aplant nutrition 3aplant pathogenic fungi 3arust diseases 3aserpentine 3aserpentine soils 3asoaking 3aspores 2aAnalysis of Variance 2aBasidiomycotaxpathogenicity 2aCalcium Chloridexanalysis 2aDemography 2aImmunity, Innatexphysiology 2aLinaceaexmicrobiologyxphysiology. 2aPlant Diseasesxmicrobiology 2aSoilxanalysis. 2aSpectrum Analysis 3aCalifornia 0aCalifornia 0aHesperolinon californicum 0aPathogen refuge hypothesis 0aSerpentine soil 0aSoil calcium1 aHardcastle, Bree A. 1 aGilbert, Gregory S. 0 tOecologia.g2007 Feb., v. 151, no. 1 p.10-21dBerlin/Heidelberg : Springer-Verlagx0029-85497nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00442-006-0566-13Available from publisher's Web site  a20071209b20080102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03394naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002000110040001800130100001500148245012700163300001800290500002400308500001500332506007600347520138800423506003701811650002401848650002501872650002401897650002001921650001201941650001601953650001101969650002001980650001802000650002402018650001702042650001602059650004102075650003102116650007702147650003602224650002002260650003002280650000902310650002002319650002902339650007202368650001302440653001702453700001802470700001702488773015302505852000902658856005402667930003302721945001302754946001302767655001202780IND2180658520221207125411.0981026e199803  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND218065852DNAL7 a95011482pmid7 aPMC350852pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSuzuki, T.14aThe chloroplast small heat-shock protein oligomer is not phosphorylated and does not dissociate during heat stress in vivo  ap. 1151-1161.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aPlants synthesize several classes of small (15- to 30-kD monomer) heat-shock proteins (sHSPs) in response to heat stress, including a nuclear-encoded, chloroplast-localized sHSP (HSP21). Cytosolic sHSPs exist as large oligomers (approximately 200-800 kD) composed solely or primarily of sHSPs. Phosphorylation of mammalian sHSPs causes oligomer dissociation, which appears to be important for regulation of sHSP function. We examined the native structure and phosphorylation of chloroplast HSP21 to understand this protein's basic properties and to compare it with cytosolic sHSPs. The apparent size of native HSP21 complexes was > 200 kD and they did not dissociate during heat stress. We found no evidence that HSP21 or the plant cytosolic sHSPs are phosphorylated in vivo. A partial HSP21 complex purified from heat-stressed pea (Pisum sativum L.) leaves contained no proteins other than HSP21. Mature recombinant pea and Arabidopsis thaliana HSP21 were expressed in Escherichia coli, and purified recombinant Arabidopsis HSP21 assembled into homo-oligomeric complexes with the same apparent molecular mass as HSP21 complexes observed in heat-stressed leaf tissue. We propose that the native, functional form of chloroplast HSP21 is a large, oligomeric complex containing nine or more HSP21 subunits, and that plant sHSPs are not regulated by phosphorylation-induced dissociation.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aheat shock proteins 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aprotein composition 3astress response 3acytosol 3aheat stress 3aleaves 3aphosphorylation 3aPisum sativum 3aprotein degradation 3achloroplasts 2aArabidopsis 2aChloroplastsxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aEscherichia colixgenetics 2aHeat-Shock Proteinsxbiosynthesisxisolation & purificationxmetabolism. 2aHeat-Shock Responsexphysiology 2aHot Temperature 2aMacromolecular Substances 2aPeas 2aPhosphorylation 2aPlant Leavesxmetabolism 2aPlant Proteinsxbiosynthesisxisolation & purificationxmetabolism. 2aPolymers 0apurification1 aKrawitz, D.C.1 aVierling, E.0 tPlant physiology.g1998 Mar., v. 116, no. 3 p.1151-1161dAmerican Society of Plant PhysiologistsaPlant physiology (Lancaster, Pa.)x0032-08897nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.plantphysiol.org/3electronic resource  a20050129b20050130c00000000  aINDdMKS  aOther US 7aarticle03181naa a2200625 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024002700133040001800160100001900178245008000197300001800277500002400295506007600319520117700395506003701572650001701609650001201626650004001638650002401678650002601702650000901728650001401737650001201751650001701763650005201780650001001832650005201842650006201894650001101956650001401967650001101981650003101992650005902023650004702082650000902129650001602138650004002154651001102194651001402205651001302219700001602232700002802248700002002276700001702296700001902313700002002332773010502352852000902457856007702466655001202543IND4429304920221207125423.0091127s2009    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442930492DNAL7 a199402242pmid7 aPMC27829722pmcid7 a10.2337/dc08-15102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCox, Daniel J.10aDriving Mishaps Among Individuals With Type 1 Diabetes: A prospective study  ap. 2177-2180.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aOBJECTIVE: Hypoglycemia-related neuroglycopenia disrupts cognitive-motor functioning, which can impact driving safety. Retrospective studies suggest that drivers with type 1 diabetes experience more collisions and citations than their nondiabetic spouses. We present the first prospective data documenting the occurrence of apparent neuroglycopenia-related driving performance impairments. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We completed the initial screening of 452 drivers from three geographically diverse centers who then reported monthly occurrences of driving "mishaps," including collisions, citations, losing control, automatic driving, someone else taking over driving, and moderate or severe hypoglycemia while driving. RESULTS: Over 12 months, 52% of the drivers reported at least one hypoglycemia-related driving mishap and 5% reported six or more. These mishaps were related to mileage driven, history of severe hypoglycemia, and use of insulin pump therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Many individuals with type 1 diabetes report hypoglycemia-related driving events. Clinicians should explore the recent experiences with hypoglycemia while driving and the risk of future events.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3ahypoglycemia 3ainsulin 3ainsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 3aprospective studies 3aretrospective studies 3arisk 3ascreening 3aspouses 3atherapeutics 2aAccidents, Trafficxstatistics & numerical data 2aAdult 2aAutomobile Drivingxstatistics & numerical data 2aDiabetes Mellitus, Type 1xdrug therapyxphysiopathology. 2aFemale 2aGeography 2aHumans 2aHypoglycemiaxepidemiology 2aHypoglycemic Agentsxadverse effectsxtherapeutic use. 2aInsulinxadverse effectsxtherapeutic use. 2aMale 2aMiddle Aged 2aSafetyxstatistics & numerical data 0aBoston 0aMinnesota 0aVirginia1 aFord, Derek1 aGonder-Frederick, Linda1 aClarke, William1 aMazze, Roger1 aWeinger, Katie1 aRitterband, Lee0 tDiabetes care.g2009 Dec., v. 32, no. 12 p.2177-2180dAmerican Diabetes Associationx0149-59927nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2337/dc08-15103Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02057naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001500110245011200125300001600237500002400253520100800277650004301285650001801328650001601346650001701362650002601379650001901405650001101424650001301435650001301448650001301461650001701474650001301491700003001504700002201534700001601556773010201572852000901674655001201683IND4365381620221122231603.0041103e200411  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436538162DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPolder, G.10aMeasuring surface distribution of carotenes and chlorophyll in ripening tomatoes using imaging spectrometry  ap. 117-129.  aIncludes references  aTomatoes (Lycopersicum esculentum, Mill. cv.

The relation between the compound concentrations measured with HPLC and the spectral images was analyzed using partial least squares (PLS) regression. The Q2 error of the predicted lycopene concentration, determined from the PLS procedure, was 0.95 on a pixel basis, and 0.96 on a tomato basis. The Q2 error of the other compounds varied from 0.73 to 0.84. Pixel-based regression made it possible to construct concentration images of the tomatoes, which showed non-uniform ripening.

We conducted a field experiment to test enhancement of a local population of juvenile P. argus with the addition of artificial shelters (“casitas”) that mimic large crevices (1.1 m² in surface area and 3.8 cm in height). Changes in density and biomass of juvenile lobsters 15-50 mm carapace length (CL) were assessed with a multiple before-after control-impact (MBACI) analysis. Separate analyses were also conducted on small (15-35 mm CL) and large (35.1-50 mm CL) juveniles to assess size-related effects. First, we carried out 13 lobster surveys on nine fixed 1-ha sites over a shallow reef lagoon (“before” period). Then, we deployed ten casitas in each of five sites and left four sites as controls, and conducted 22 further surveys (“after” period). Deployment of casitas resulted in a sixfold increase in juvenile density (76% contributed by small and 24% by large juveniles) and a sevenfold increase in biomass (40 and 60%, respectively). Capture-recapture results revealed that enhancement was achieved not by promoting individual growth but by increasing survival, persistence, and foraging ranges of small and large juveniles. Casitas both mitigated shortage of natural shelter and increased sociality, allowing for cohabitation of smaller, more vulnerable juveniles with larger conspecifics that have greater defensive abilities. Casitas may help enhance local populations of juvenile P. argus in Caribbean seagrass habitats, typically poor in natural crevice shelters. The use of MBACI and the simultaneous assessment of multiple interrelated response variables may be a powerful analytical approach to test shelter limitation in other species and to examine the function of structural habitat in other systems. 3aPanulirus argus 3aanalytical methods 3abiomass 3afield experimentation 3aforaging 3ahabitats 3ajuveniles 3alobsters 3apopulation dynamics 3aseagrasses 3asocial behavior 3asurface area 3asurveys 2aAnalysis of Variance 2aAnimals 2aBiomass 2aBody Weights and Measures 2aConservation of Natural Resourcesxmethods 2aEcosystem 2aPalinuridaexphysiology 2aPopulation Density 2aPopulation Dynamics 2aSurvival Analysis 3aCaribbean 0aMexico 0aApparent survival 0aGrowth 0aSociality 0aPopulation bottlenecks1 aLozano-Álvarez, Enrique 1 aNegrete-Soto, Fernando 1 aBarradas-Ortiz, Cecilia 0 tOecologia.g2007 Mar., v. 151, no. 3 p.401-416dBerlin/Heidelberg : Springer-Verlagx0029-85497nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00442-006-0595-93electronic resource  a20070304b20070402c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03933naa a2200853 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002000110040001800130100001700148245014200165300001800307500002400325500001500349506007600364520129900440506003701739650001901776650001601795650001801811650001801829650001301847650001001860650002101870650001101891650003001902650002001932650002201952650002501974650001501999650002202014650002602036650002702062650002902089650002602118650002002144650002702164650001802191650002202209650002502231650001902256650001002275650002902285650001202314650003902326650001802365650002002383650002302403650002002426650003302446650001802479650001702497650003502514650005502549650002502604650001202629653001502641653003002656653002302686653001702709653001502726700001602741700001602757700001902773773015302792852000902945856005402954930003303008945001303041946001303054655001203067IND2181108620221207114358.0981117e199804  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND218110862DNAL7 a95360472pmid7 aPMC350372pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHatzfeld, Y.10aEffect of ATP sulfurylase overexpression in bright yellow 2 tobacco cells: regulation of ATP sulfurylase and SO4(-2) transport activities  ap. 1307-1313.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aTo determine if the ATP sulfurylase reaction is a regulatory step for the SO4(2-)-assimilation pathway in plants, an Arabidopsis thaliana ATP sulfurylase cDNA, APS2, was fused to the 355 promoter of the cauliflower mosaic virus and introduced by Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation into isolated Bright Yellow 2 tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) cells. The ATP sulfurylase activity in transgenic cells was 8-fold that in control cells, and was correlated with the expression of a specific polypeptide revealed by western analysis using an anti-ATP sulfurylase antibody. The molecular mass of this polypeptide agreed with that for the overexpressed mature protein. ATP sulfurylase overexpression had no effect on [35S]SO4(2-) influx or ATP sulfurylase activity regulation by S availability, except that ATP sulfurylase activity variations in response to S starvation in transgenic cells were 8 times higher than in the wild type. There were also no differences in cell growth or sensitivity to SeO4(2-) (a toxic SO4(2-) analog) between transgenic and wild-type cells. We propose that in Bright Yellow 2 tobacco cells, the ATP sulfurylase derepression by S deficiency may involve a posttranscriptional mechanism, and that the ATP sulfurylase abundance is not limiting for cell metabolism.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3asulfur dioxide 3acell growth 3aradiolabeling 3aion transport 3aselenium 3agenes 3apromoter regions 3asulfur 3aAgrobacterium radiobacter 3agene expression 3aNicotiana tabacum 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3ametabolism 3acomplementary DNA 3anutrient deficiencies 3aadenosine triphosphate 3atranscription (genetics) 3anutrient requirements 3aenzyme activity 3agenetic transformation 3agene transfer 3atransgenic plants 3abiochemical pathways 3acultured cells 3acolor 3aCauliflower mosaic virus 3amutants 2aArabidopsisxenzymologyxgenetics. 2aCell Division 2aCells, Cultured 2aCloning, Molecular 2aGene Expression 2aPlants, Genetically Modified 2aPlants, Toxic 2aSelenic Acid 2aSelenium Compoundsxmetabolism 2aSulfate Adenylyltransferasexgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aSulfatesxmetabolism 2aTobacco 0asubstrates 0aAgrobacterium tumefaciens 0agenetic regulation 0awild strains 0aaps2 genes1 aCathala, N.1 aGrignon, C.1 aDavidian, J.C.0 tPlant physiology.g1998 Apr., v. 116, no. 4 p.1307-1313dAmerican Society of Plant PhysiologistsaPlant physiology (Lancaster, Pa.)x0032-08897nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.plantphysiol.org/3electronic resource  a20050129b20050130c00000000  aINDdMKS  aOther US 7aarticle02825naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110245008700128300001800215500002400233500001500257520139600272650002301668650003701691650002401728650001801752650001101770650001201781650000701793650002901800650001401829650001601843650002801859650001001887653001701897653001501914653001401929653001201943653002401955700001701979700001701996700001602013700001502029773015302044852000902197856005402206930003302260945001302293946001302306655001202319IND2181108020221122182200.0981117e199804  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND218110802DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJolicoeur, M.10aIntracellular pH in arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi: a symbiotic physiological marker  ap. 1279-1288.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aA method was developed to perform real-time analysis of cytosolic pH of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi in culture using dye and ratiometric measurements (490/450 nm excitations). The study was mainly performed using photometric analysis, although some data were confirmed using image analysis. The use of nigericin allowed an in vivo calibration. Experimental parameters such as loading time and concentration of the dye were determined so that pH measurements could be made for a steady-state period on viable cells. A characteristic pH profile was observed along hyphae. For Gigaspora margarita, the pH of the tip (0-2 micrometers) was typically 6.7, increased sharply to 7.0 behind this region (9.5 micrometers), and descreased over the next 250 micrometers to a constant value of 6.6. A similar pattern was obtained for Glomus intraradices. The pH profile of G. margarita germ tubes was higher when cultured in the presence of carrot (Daucus carota) hairy roots (nonmycorrhizal). Similarly, extraradical hyphae of G. intraradices had a higher apical pH than the germ tubes. The use of a paper layer to prevent the mycorrhizal roots from being in direct contact with the medium selected hyphae with an even higher cytosolic pH. Results suggest that this method could be useful as a bioassay for studying signal perception and/or H+ cotransport of nutrients by arbuscular mycorrhizal hyphae. 3anutrient transport 3avesicular arbuscular mycorrhizae 3aGigaspora margarita 3aDaucus carota 3ahyphae 3acytosol 3apH 3aRhizophagus intraradices 3anigericin 3ameasurement 3afluorescence microscopy 3aroots 0alocalization 0agerm tubes 0asymbiosis 0amarkers 0aGlomus intraradices1 aGermette, S.1 aGaudette, M.1 aPerrier, M.1 aBecard, G.0 tPlant physiology.g1998 Apr., v. 116, no. 4 p.1279-1288dAmerican Society of Plant PhysiologistsaPlant physiology (Lancaster, Pa.)x0032-08897nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.plantphysiol.org/3electronic resource  a20050129b20050130c00000000  aINDdMKS  aOther US 7aarticle02261naa a2200337 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100002600115245007100141300001400212300002300226520125300249650001801502650001401520650002501534653002401559653002401583653003101607653001801638653003001656653002701686711006201713773007301775852000901848939003301857945000801890946001301898655001201911991618492850742620221122182205.0820527e198203  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI820007702DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSilverman, Richard S.14aThe impact of deregulation on the food industry: Will it continue?  ap. 27-28.  ap. 27-28, 32. ill.  aThe regulatory reform movement has had an impact on existing regulations, proposed regulations, and state and local regulations; there is debate on whether food industry deregulation will continue. It is anticipated that the process of revocation of regulations targeted for review by the Presidential Task Force on Regulatory Relief (e.g., USDA's mechanically deboned meat regulations, and fruit and vegetable marketing orders) may be extremely slow. Few new regulations are being proposed. Further, USDA has recently revealed total or pending withdrawals of a number of proposed regulations. State and local regulation initiatives, however, are continuing at a high activity level. The long term future for food industry regulatory reform will depend largely on the industry itself. Two illustrations of this are given. A recent public survey indicates that private industry would be well-served by voluntary action to fill any void created by deregulation. It is concluded that, in the short term, fewer and more cost-effective regulations will occur, with less enforcement. Nonetheless, this may change, depending on industry's willingness to voluntarily assume the responsibilities of decreased government intervention in the marketplace.

Immunoblot analyses identified these proteins as the E1 beta-, E1 alpha-, E2-, and E3-subunits, respectively. The molecular mass of maize E2 is considerably smaller than that of other plant E2 subunits (76 kD). The activity of the maize mitochondrial complex has a pH optimum of 7.5 and a divalent cation requirement best satisfied by Mg2+. Michaelis constants for the substrates were 47, 3, 77, and 1 micromolar for pyruvate, coenzyme A (CoA), NAD+, and thiamine pyrophosphate, respectively. The products NADH and acetyl-CoA were competitive inhibitors with respect to NAD+ and CoA, and the inhibition constants were 15 and 47 micromolar, respectively. The complex was inactivated by phosphorylation and was reactivated after the removal of ATP and the addition of Mg2+. 3aZea mays 3aNAD (coenzyme) 3apyruvate dehydrogenase (lipoamide) 3aadenosine triphosphate 3aphysicochemical properties 3amagnesium 3aenzyme inhibitors 3aacetyl coenzyme A 3amitochondria 3aetiolation 3aenzyme activity 3aprotein composition 3ashoots 0apurification 0aregulation 0asubstrates1 aMiernyk, J.A.1 aRandall, D.D.0 tPlant physiology.g1998 Apr., v. 116, no. 4 p.1443-1450dAmerican Society of Plant PhysiologistsaPlant physiology (Lancaster, Pa.)x0032-08897nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.plantphysiol.org/3electronic resource  a20050129b20050130c00000000  aINDdMKS  aOther US 7aarticle01953naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002800092040001800120100001900138245016800157300001600325500002500341520080400366650001601170650001801186650000901204650002301213650001901236651002101255653001101276653002801287653001601315700001501331773008701346852000901433856007801442930003301520945001301553946001301566655001201579IND2057719220221122061353.0970616e199704  nyu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205771922DNAL7 a10.1007/BF028931022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMatthews, P.J.10aPlant remains from waterlogged sites in the Arawe Islands, West New Britain Province, Papua New Guinea: implications for the history of plant use and domestication  ap. 121-133.  aSummary in Japanese.  aPlant remains in the Arawe Islands were found preserved in waterlogged beach sediments. Remnants of edible fruit and wild nuts were found together with Lapita pottery, stone artifacts, and other evidence of human settlement. Previous discoveries of fruit and nut remains in Lapita pottery sites have been interpreted as evidence for an arboricultural complex based on a variety of tree species. Here we report direct evidence for plant use, but are unable to recognise any particular system of plant cultivation or harvest. All the genera and species recognised in the Arawe plant remains are known to enter modern beach drift by natural processes, from wild and cultivated sources. The archaeological assemblages pose intriguing problems for interpreting the history of plant use and domestication. 3aethnobotany 3adomestication 3anuts 3aflooded conditions 3aedible species 3aPapua New Guinea 0afruits 0aarchaeological material 0aarchaeology1 aGosden, C.0 tEconomic botany.g1997 , v. 51, no. 2 p.121-133wJournal:jnl44652x0013-00017nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF028931023Available from publisher's Web site  a19970703b19970710c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle02654naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100001600171245017000187300001600357520106800373650001601441650001201457650001401469650003001483650001801513650001201531650001601543650002901559650002201588650002801610650002601638650002701664650002801691650003001719650002601749650002901775650003401804650003401838650002601872700001501898773008901913852000902002856009202011930003302103945001302136946001102149655001202160IND2243735820221122061359.0010316e200011  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND224373582DNAL7 a111191472pmid7 a10.1046/j.1365-2672.2000.01172.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPalmano, S.10aDiversity of phytoplasmas isolated from insects, determined by a DNA heteroduplex mobility assay and a length polymorphism of the 16S-23S rDNA spacer region analysis  ap. 744-750.  aTwo techniques were developed for the analysis of non-cultivable mollicutes in insects. The first was aimed at detecting organisms belonging to undiscovered groups within the phytoplasma clade. After prescreening by polymerase chain reaction with phytoplasma-specific primers, nucleic acids from 54 positive samples were amplified using phytoplasma-specific fluorescein-labelled primers flanking the 16S-23S rDNA spacer region, which is variable in length among the phytoplasmas. The sizes of all the detected products were only those expected for already-described phytoplasma subclades. It was also shown that a single leafhopper might carry different phytoplasmas, at similar or very different relative concentrations. The second technique, based on the heteroduplex mobility assay, was designed for the detection of organisms phylogenetically similar to phytoplasmas but not recognized by the specific primer pair. As a result, signals generated by ribosomal DNA of organisms which appear to be closely related but not identical to phytoplasmas were detected. 3aPhytoplasma 3ainsects 3aphylogeny 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aribosomal DNA 2aAnimals 2aDNA Primers 2aDNA, Bacterialxanalysis 2aGenetic Variation 2aHemipteraxmicrobiology 2aHeteroduplex Analysis 2aInsectaxmicrobiology. 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPolymerase Chain Reaction 2aPolymorphism, Genetic 2aRNA, Bacterialxanalysis 2aRNA, Ribosomal, 16Sxanalysis 2aRNA, Ribosomal, 23Sxanalysis 2aTenericutesxgenetics1 aFirrao, G.0 tJournal of applied microbiology.g2000 Nov., v. 89, no. 5 p.744-750x1364-50727nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2672.2000.01172.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20010501b20010507c00000000  aINDdGK1  aNon-US 7aarticle02324naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100002300184245011500207300001800322506007600340520089700416506003701313650002101350650001201371650002201383650001001405650001301415650001301428650002401441700001701465700001901482700001701501700002101518700002201539700001801561773017301579852000901752856008301761930003301844946001301877655001201890IND4387283020221207100936.0070128e20070123xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438728302DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.06103481042doi7 aPMC17831182pmcid7 a172202692pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aConroy, Matthew J.14aThe crystal structure of the Escherichia coli AmtB-GlnK complex reveals how GlnK regulates the ammonia channel  ap. 1213-1218.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aAmt proteins are ubiquitous channels for the conduction of ammonia in archaea, eubacteria, fungi, and plants. In Escherichia coli, previous studies have indicated that binding of the PII signal transduction protein GlnK to the ammonia channel AmtB regulates the channel thereby controlling ammonium influx in response to the intracellular nitrogen status. Here, we describe the crystal structure of the complex between AmtB and GlnK at a resolution of 2.5 Å. This structure of PII in a complex with one of its targets reveals physiologically relevant conformations of both AmtB and GlnK. GlnK interacts with AmtB almost exclusively via a long surface loop containing Y51 (T-loop), the tip of which inserts deeply into the cytoplasmic pore exit, blocking ammonia conduction. Y51 of GlnK is also buried in the pore exit, explaining why uridylylation of this residue prevents complex formation.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aEscherichia coli 3aammonia 3acrystal structure 3afungi 3anitrogen 3aproteins 3asignal transduction1 aDurand, Anne1 aLupo, Domenico1 aLi, Xiao-Dan1 aBullough, Per A.1 aWinkler, Fritz K.1 aMerrick, Mike0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2007 Jan. 23, v. 104, no. 4 p.1213-1218dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.06103481043Available from publisher's Web site  a20070128b20070202c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02990naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100002300184245012200207300001800329506007600347520150400423506003701927650001001964650001501974650001501989650002402004650001802028650002202046650001902068650001502087650002002102650001502122700002602137700002102163700002202184700002702206773017302233852000902406856008302415930003302498946001302531655001202544IND4387283520221207103220.0070128e20070123xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438728352DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.06105231042doi7 aPMC17831012pmcid7 a172278432pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFoti, Michelangelo14aThe neck of caveolae is a distinct plasma membrane subdomain that concentrates insulin receptors in 3T3-L1 adipocytes  ap. 1242-1247.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aInsulin receptors (IRs) segregate on plasma membrane microvilli, but in cells devoid of microvilli, such as adipocytes, the localization of IRs is a matter of controversy. In the present study, we examined the distribution of IRs in the plasma membrane of 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Quantitative electron microscopy indicates that IRs are predominantly associated with the neck, but not the bulb, of caveolae. Caveola necks represent distinct microdomains of the plasma membrane. Indeed, as shown by freeze-fracture analysis, intramembrane particles are concentrated as necklaces around the craters of caveolae. In addition, subcellular fractionation suggests that the neck and the bulb of caveolae present a different resistance to detergent solubility. Finally, cytoskeletal components, including actin, are highly enriched in the membrane area underlying the neck part of caveolae. IRs coimmunoprecipitate with cytoskeletal components, and disruption of the actin cytoskeleton alters IRs expression, localization, and signaling, thus supporting the notion that caveola necks are involved in intracellular signaling by IRs. Together, these results suggest that cytoskeletal proteins anchor IRs to microdomains in the caveola necks of 3T3-L1 adipocytes. By homology with IR localization in other cell types, we suggest that the necks of caveolae may represent the counterpart of microvillar domains in cells poor in microvilli such as adipocytes and that they play an important role as signaling platforms.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aactin 3aadipocytes 3adetergents 3aelectron microscopy 3afractionation 3ainsulin receptors 3amicrofilaments 3amicrovilli 3aplasma membrane 3asolubility1 aPorcheron, Geneviève1 aFournier, Margot1 aMaeder, Christine1 aCarpentier, Jean-Louis0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2007 Jan. 23, v. 104, no. 4 p.1242-1247dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.06105231043Available from publisher's Web site  a20070128b20070202c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02167naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002800092040001800120100002700138245006800165300001400233500002400247520100300271650001201274650001901286650001201305650003001317650001401347650002101361650001801382650002201400650001401422651002001436651001301456653002001469653000901489700001601498773008501514852000901599856007801608930003301686945001301719946001301732655001201745IND2079970920221122051305.0980505e199801  nyu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND207997092DNAL7 a10.1007/BF028612962doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZizumbo-Villarreal, D.10aRe-evaluation of early observations on coconut in the New World  ap. 68-77.  aSummary in Spanish.  aOviedo’s sixteenth century reports from the New World, relating the characteristics, uses, cultivation and geographical distribution Cocos nucifera, are analyzed in terms of their veracity and implications for the evolution of this highly important economic species. The presence of coconut on the Pacific coasts of Costa Rica, Panama, and Colombia is supported by the documentary evidence. The variability reported suggests a gene pool which includes the “wild” and “domesticated” morphotypes in populations similar to those distributed in the South Pacific region. The diffusion to America could have involved a large number of seeds. A close association between coconuts and humans, including a variety of uses and its cultivation is reported in the early sixteenth century literature. Evidence suggests both natural diffusion and diffusion by the intervention of humans. Studies of the genetic diversity in the region will identify valuable genotypes for improvement and conservation. 3atillage 3aCocos nucifera 3ahistory 3ageographical distribution 3aevolution 3aplant morphology 3adomestication 3agenetic variation 3aendosperm 3aCentral America 3aColombia 0acharacteristics 0auses1 aQuero, H.J.0 tEconomic botany.g1998 , v. 52, no. 1 p.68-77wJournal:jnl44652x0013-00017nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF028612963Available from publisher's Web site  a19980531b19980605c00000000  aINDdCTR  aOther US 7aarticle04332naa a2200853 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002000110040001800130100001300148245011700161300001800278500002400296500001500320506007600335520170300411506003702114650001702151650001602168650001202184650001002196650003002206650001702236650002002253650002202273650001802295650002202313650002502335650001602360650002702376650001802403650002202421650002202443650002002465650001602485650002202501650002502523650001302548650004002561650002402601650003502625650001802660650004702678650002102725650002302746650001302769650002802782650003302810650001802843650004202861650003402903650004502937650002202982653001403004653002803018653001103046653002303057653001203080653003003092700001403122700001403136700001303150700001603163700001203179773015303191852000903344856005403353930003303407945001303440946001303453655001203466IND2181111920221207124458.0981117e199804  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND218111192DNAL7 a95360542pmid7 aPMC350442pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKaye, C.10aCharacterization of a gene for spinach CAP160 and expression of two spinach cold-acclimation proteins in tobacco  ap. 1367-1377.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe cDNA sequence for CAP160, an acidic protein previously linked with cold acclimation in spinach (Spinacia oleracea L.), was characterized and found to encode a novel acidic protein of 780 amino acids having very limited homology to a pair of Arabidopsis thaliana stress-regulated proteins, rd29A and rd29B. The lack of similarity in the structural organization of the spinach and Arabidopsis genes highlights the absence of a high degree of conservation of this cold-stress gene across taxonomic boundaries. The protein has several unique motifs that may relate to its function during cold stress. Expression of the CAP160 mRNA was increased by low-temperature exposure and water stress in a manner consistent with a probable function during stresses that involve dehydration. The coding sequences for CAP160 and CAP85, another spinach cold-stress protein, were introduced into tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) under the control of the 35S promoter using Agrobacterium tumefaciens-based transformation. Tobacco plants expressing the proteins individually or coexpressing both proteins were evaluated for relative freezing-stress tolerance. The killing temperature for 50% of the cells of the transgenic plants was not different from that of the wild-type plants. As determined by a more sensitive time/temperature kinetic study, plants expressing the spinach proteins had slightly lower levels of electrolyte leakage than wild-type plants, indicative of a small reduction of freezing-stress injury. Clearly, the heterologous expression of two cold-stress proteins had no profound influence on stress tolerance, a result that is consistent with the quantitative nature of cold-stress-tolerance traits.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aelectrolytes 3aacclimation 3adrought 3agenes 3aAgrobacterium radiobacter 3awater stress 3agene expression 3aNicotiana tabacum 3amessenger RNA 3acomplementary DNA 3aamino acid sequences 3atemperature 3agenetic transformation 3agene transfer 3aprotein synthesis 3atransgenic plants 3astress response 3acold stress 3aSpinacia oleracea 3anucleotide sequences 3akinetics 2aAdaptation, Physiologicalxgenetics 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aArabidopsis Proteinsxgenetics 2aBase Sequence 2aCold Shock Proteins and Peptidesxgenetics 2aCold Temperature 2aDNA, Complementary 2aFreezing 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPlants, Genetically Modified 2aPlants, Toxic 2aRNA, Messengerxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aSequence Homology, Amino Acid 2aSpinacia oleraceaxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aTobaccoxgenetics 0ainduction 0amolecular sequence data 0atiming 0agenetic regulation 0aleakage 0aAgrobacterium tumefaciens1 aNeven, L.1 aHofig, A.1 aLi, Q.B.1 aHaskell, D.1 aGuy, C.0 tPlant physiology.g1998 Apr., v. 116, no. 4 p.1367-1377dAmerican Society of Plant PhysiologistsaPlant physiology (Lancaster, Pa.)x0032-08897nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.plantphysiol.org/3electronic resource  a20050129b20050130c00000000  aINDdMKS  aOther US 7aarticle03182naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100002900184245008400213300001800297506007600315520155000391506003701941650003101978650002102009650002102030650001202051650001602063650001402079650002802093650001402121650002102135650002202156650003302178700002402211700002002235700001902255700002002274700002502294700003602319700002202355773017302377852000902550856008302559930003302642946001302675655001202688IND4387283420221207101832.0070128e20070123xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438728342DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.06105001042doi7 aPMC17730562pmcid7 a172298372pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWestlake, Christopher J.10aIdentification of Rab11 as a small GTPase binding protein for the Evi5 oncogene  ap. 1236-1241.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe Evi5 oncogene has recently been shown to regulate the stability and accumulation of critical G₁ cell cycle factors including Emi1, an inhibitor of the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome, and cyclin A. Sequence analysis of the amino terminus of Evi5 reveals a Tre-2, Bub2, Cdc16 domain, which has been shown to be a binding partner and GTPase-activating protein domain for the Rab family of small Ras-like GTPases. Here we describe the identification of Evi5 as a candidate binding protein for Rab11, a GTPase that regulates intracellular transport and has specific roles in endosome recycling and cytokinesis. By yeast two-hybrid analysis, immunoprecipitation, and Biacore analysis, we demonstrate that Evi5 binds Rab11a and Rab11b in a GTP-dependent manner. However, Evi5 displays no activation of Rab11 GTPase activity in vitro. Evi5 colocalizes with Rab11 in vivo, and overexpression of Rab11 perturbs the localization of Evi5, redistributing it into Rab11-positive recycling endosomes. Interestingly, in vitro binding studies show that Rab11 effector proteins including FIP3 compete with Evi5 for binding to Rab11, suggesting a partitioning between Rab11-Evi5 and Rab11 effector complexes. Indeed, ablation of Evi5 by RNA interference causes a mislocalization of FIP3 at the abscission site during cytokinesis. These data demonstrate that Evi5 is a Rab11 binding protein and that Evi5 may cooperate with Rab11 to coordinate vesicular trafficking, cytokinesis, and cell cycle control independent of GTPase-activating protein function.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aGTPase-activating proteins 3aRNA interference 3abinding proteins 3acyclins 3acytokinesis 3aendosomes 3aguanosinetriphosphatase 3aoncogenes 3aprecipitin tests 3asequence analysis 3atwo hybrid system techniques1 aJunutula, Jagath R.1 aSimon, Glenn C.1 aPilli, Manohar1 aPrekeris, Rytis1 aScheller, Richard H.1 aJackson, Peter K.q(Peter Kent)1 aEldridge, Adam G.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2007 Jan. 23, v. 104, no. 4 p.1236-1241dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.06105001043Available from publisher's Web site  a20070128b20070202c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02888naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001500110245014500125300001800270500002400288500001500312520126600327650001401593650004201607650001401649650001701663650001501680650001001695650003601705650002501741650001701766650001801783650000701801650001301808650001501821650001401836650002201850650001801872650001801890650001501908650004301923653001501966653001601981653002101997653001102018653001502029700001502044773015302059852000902212856005402221930003302275945001302308946001302321655001202334IND2181116520221122013442.0981117e199804  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND218111652DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPeiser, G.10aEvidence for 1-(malonylamino)cyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid being the major conjugate of aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid in tomato fruit  ap. 1527-1532.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aTomato (Lycopersicon esculentum Miller) fruit discs fed with [2,3-14C]-1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC) formed 1-malonyl-ACC (MACC) as the major conjugate of ACC in fruit throughout all ripening stages, from immature-green through the red-ripe stage.

No GACC formation was observed from etiolated mung bean (Vigna radiata [L.] Wilczek) hypocotyls, etiolated common vetch (Vicia sativum L.) epicotyls, or pea (Pisum sativum L.) root tips, etiolated epicotyls, and green stem tissue, where active conversion of ACC into MACC was observed. GACC was, however, formed in vitro in extracts from fruit of all ripening stages. GACC formation in an extract from red fruit at pH 7.15 was only about 3% of that at pH 8.0, the pH at which most assays were run. Our present in vivo data support the previous contention that MACC is the major conjugate of ACC in plant tissues, whereasGACC is a minor, if any, conjugate of ACC. Thus, our data do not support the proposal that GACC formation could be more important than MACC formation in tomato fruit. 3aroot tips 3a1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid 3acultivars 3abiosynthesis 3ahypocotyls 3astems 3achemical constituents of plants 3adevelopmental stages 3aVicia sativa 3aVigna radiata 3apH 3aripening 3amalic acid 3aepicotyls 3agenetic variation 3aPisum sativum 3aglutamic acid 3aetiolation 3aSolanum lycopersicum var. lycopersicum 0aprecursors 0aderivatives 0acarboxylic acids 0afruits 0aregulation1 aYang, S.F.0 tPlant physiology.g1998 Apr., v. 116, no. 4 p.1527-1532dAmerican Society of Plant PhysiologistsaPlant physiology (Lancaster, Pa.)x0032-08897nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.plantphysiol.org/3electronic resource  a20050421b20050501c00000000  aINDdMKS  aOther US 7aarticle02955naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110245009600128300001800224500002400242500001500266520138500281650002501666650001701691650002201708650002301730650001901753650002001772650002201792650001901814650001501833650001101848650001301859650001801872650001301890650001001903650002501913650001901938650002701957653001301984653001501997653001702012653001602029653001802045700001302063700001102076700001102087700001602098773015302114852000902267856005402276930003302330945001302363946001302376655001202389IND2181103720221121140643.0981117e199804  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND218110372DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMorelli, J.K.10aActin depolymerization affects stress-induced translational activity of potato tuber tissue  ap. 1227-1237.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aChanges in polymerized actin during stress conditions were correlated with potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) tuber protein synthesis. Fluorescence microscopy and immunoblot analyses indicated that filamentous actin was nearly undetectable in mature, quiescent aerobic tubers. Mechanical wounding of postharvest tubers resulted in a localized increase of polymerized actin, and microfilament bundles were visible in cells of the wounded periderm within 12 h after wounding. During this same period translational activity increased 8-fold. By contrast, low-oxygen stress caused rapid reduction of polymerized actin coincident with acute inhibition of protein synthesis. Treatment of aerobic tubers with cytochalasin D, an agent that disrupts actin filaments, reduced wound-induced protein synthesis in vivo. This effect was not observed when colchicine, an agent that depolymerizes microtubules, was used. Neither of these drugs had a significant effect in vitro on run-off translation of isolated polysomes. However, cytochalasin D did reduce translational competence in vitro of a crude cellular fraction containing both polysomes and cytoskeletal elements. These results demonstrate the dependence of wound-induced protein synthesis on the integrity of microfilaments and suggest that the dynamics of the actin cytoskeleton may affect translational activity during stress conditions. 3aanaerobic conditions 3abiosynthesis 3aprotein synthesis 3aoxygen requirement 3apolymerization 3astress response 3aSolanum tuberosum 3amicrofilaments 3acolchicine 3atubers 3apotatoes 3apolyribosomes 3aperiderm 3aactin 3ametabolic inhibitors 3acytochalasin D 3apostharvest physiology 0ainjuries 0ainhibition 0alocalization 0atranslation 0aplant anatomy1 aZhou, W.1 aYu, J.1 aLu, C.1 aVayda, M.E.0 tPlant physiology.g1998 Apr., v. 116, no. 4 p.1227-1237dAmerican Society of Plant PhysiologistsaPlant physiology (Lancaster, Pa.)x0032-08897nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.plantphysiol.org/3electronic resource  a20050129b20050130c00000000  aINDdMKS  aOther US 7aarticle02449naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245011700126300001800243500002400261520102200285650001501307650001301322650002001335650002601355650001801381650001701399650002101416650002701437650002001464650002501484650002901509650002001538653002401558653001701582653001601599653001301615700001401628700001701642700001701659700001601676773015301692852000901845856005401854930003301908945001301941946001301954655001201967IND2181103820221121105447.0981117e199804  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND218110382DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRabbani, S.10aInduced beta-carotene synthesis driven by triacylglycerol deposition in the unicellular alga Dunaliella bardawil  ap. 1239-1248.  aIncludes references  aUnder stress conditions such as high light intensity or nutrient starvation, cells of the unicellular alga Dunaliella bardawil overproduce beta-carotene, which is accumulated in the plastids in newly formed triacylglycerol droplets. We report here that the formation of these sequestering structures and beta-carotene are interdependent. When the synthesis of triacylglycerol is blocked, the overproduction of beta-carotene is also inhibited. During overproduction of beta-carotene no up-regulation of phytoene synthase or phytoene desaturase is observed on the transcriptional or translational level, whereas at the same time acetyl-CoA carboxylase, the key regulatory enzyme of acyl lipid biosynthesis, is increased, at least in its enzymatic activity. We conclude that under normal conditions the carotenogenic pathway is not maximally active and may be appreciably stimulated in the presence of sequestering structures, creating a plastid-localized sink for the end product of the carotenoid biosynthetic pathway. 3aDunaliella 3aplastids 3alight intensity 3anutrient deficiencies 3abeta-carotene 3abiosynthesis 3atriacylglycerols 3aacetyl-CoA carboxylase 3aenzyme activity 3abiochemical pathways 3atranscription (genetics) 3astress response 0acell ultrastructure 0alocalization 0atranslation 0aphytoene1 aBeyer, P.1 aLintig, J.V.1 aHugueney, P.1 aKleinig, H.0 tPlant physiology.g1998 Apr., v. 116, no. 4 p.1239-1248dAmerican Society of Plant PhysiologistsaPlant physiology (Lancaster, Pa.)x0032-08897nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.plantphysiol.org/3electronic resource  a20050129b20050130c00000000  aINDdMKS  aOther US 7aarticle02139naa a2200289 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001500110245008500125300001600210500002400226520115300250650001501403650001901418650002301437653002201460700001701482773018801499852000901687856008201696930003301778945001301811946001301824655001201837IND2180744320221121070207.0981030e199803  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND218074432DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHack, C.J.10aEthanol adaptation in a thermotolerant yeast strain Kluyveromyces marxianus IMB3  ap. 227-231.  aIncludes references  aThe maximum ethanol concentration produced from glucose in defined media at 45 degrees C by the thermotolerant yeast Kluyveromyces marxianus IMB3 was 44 g L-1. Acclimatisation of the strain through continuous culture at ethanol concentrations up to 80 g L-1, shifted the maximum ethanol concentration at which growth was observed from 40 g L-1 to 70 g L-1. Four isolates were selected from the continuous culture, only one of which produced a significant increase in final ethanol concentration (50 +/- 0.4 g L-1), however in subsequent fermentations, following storage on nutrient agar plates, the maximum ethanol concentration was comparable with the original isolate. The maximum specific ethanol production rates (approximately 1.5 g (gh)-1) were also comparable with the original strain except for one isolate (0.7 g (gh)-1). The specific ethanol productivity decreased with ethanol concentration; this decrease correlated linearly (rval 0.92) with cell viability. Due to the transience of induced ethanol tolerance in the strain it was concluded that this was not a valid method for improving final ethanol concentrations or production rates. 3asoil fungi 3aheat tolerance 3aethanol production 0aethanol tolerance1 aMarchant, R.0 tJournal of industrial microbiology & biotechnology.g1998 , v. 20, no. 3/4 p.227-231dPublished by Stockton Press on behalf of the Society for Industrial Microbiologyx1367-54357nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.link.springer.de/link/service/journals/10295/3electronic resource  a20050129b20050130c00000000  aINDdGK1  aOther US 7aarticle01240naa a2200265 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097245004200115300001400157520054200171650002600713650001400739650002200753650001500775650002000790653001700810773007200827852000900899939003300908945000800941946001300949655001200962991618474780742620221121040457.0790831e197811  xx ||||go|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI794848092DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL10aRapidly rising hospital feeding costs  ap. 26-27.  aA market research report indicates that hospital feeding costs per patient per day are expected to triple by 1990 over what they were in 1975.

A high positive correlation has been obtained between yellow reflectance score and pigment content; consequently, semolina color evaluation and inheritance was successfully conducted. The semidwarfs were found to be particularly poor in seedling vigor. Large breeding nurseries were grown, and a crossing program and generation advance was completed in the greenhouse. Marked progress has been made in yield improvement and disease resistance in semidwarf durum. Improvements in plant type, straw strength, and earliness have also been accomplished. The Edmore cultivar withstood the milling and production process well; it also went through the drying process with very little breakage.

The cost of malnutrition exceeds the cost of fortification. In a theoretical country of 20 million persons, the total annual cost for fortification, equipment and administration expenses would average $0.09 per capita. Both technical and financial assistance through international and U.S. programs are available to developing nations to start cereal fortification programs. Cereal is fortified for two reasons: 1) to restore nutrients removed by the milling process; 2) to provide a carrier for deficient nutrients. Added vitamins have been shown to be stable in storage and baking; the use of bleaching, maturing and oxidizing agents is compatible with vitamin fortification. Types and levels of nutrients used in a program should be based on nutritional needs and per capita consumption of the cereal to be fortified in the target population. If the data are not available, nutrients should be restored to their original levels in the wheat. 3anutrient deficiencies 3awheat 3avitamins 3aminerals 3acosts and returns 3afood prices 3abreakfast cereals 3aflour 3adeveloping countries 0afederal aid 0afortification 0aSupplements (Nutrient)0 tMacaroni journal.g1979 June, v. 61, no. 2 p.28-29x0024-88947nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19791001c00000000  aFNC  aOther US 7aarticle02491naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001500110245011300125300001800238500002400256520102500280650001301305650001001318650002501328650001601353650002801369650002101397650002001418650001601438650001201454650002201466650001001488650002301498650001601521650001801537650002001555650001301575650002001588653001401608653001401622653001501636700001601651700001601667700001501683773015301698852000901851856005401860930003301914945001301947946001301960655001201973IND2181109520221121012041.0981117e199804  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND218110952DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRicard, B.10aEvidence for the critical role of sucrose synthase for anoxic tolerance of maize roots using a double mutant  ap. 1323-1331.  aIncludes references  aThe induction of the sucrose synthase (SuSy) gene (SuSy) by low O2, low temperature, and limiting carbohydrate supply suggested a role in carbohydrate metabolism under stress conditions. The isolation of a maize (Zea mays L.) line mutant for the two known SuSy genes but functionally normal showed that SuSy activity might not be required for aerobic growth and allowed the possibility of investigating its importance during anaerobic stress. As assessed by root elongation after return to air, hypoxic pretreatment improved anoxic tolerance, in correlation with the number of SuSy genes and the level of SuSy expression. Furthermore, root death in double-mutant seedlings during anoxic incubation could be attributed to the impaired utilization of sucrose (Suc). Collectively, these data provide unequivocal evidence that Suc is the principal C source and that SuSy is the main enzyme active in Suc breakdown in roots of maize seedlings deprived of O2. In this situation, SuSy plays a critical role in anoxic tolerance. 3aZea mays 3aroots 3aanaerobic conditions 3aacclimation 3acarbohydrate metabolism 3asucrose synthase 3aenzyme activity 3acell growth 3amutants 3agenetic variation 3agenes 3aoxygen requirement 3atemperature 3acarbohydrates 3agene expression 3agenotype 3astress response 0ainduction 0atolerance 0asusy genes1 aVanToai, T.1 aChourey, P.1 aSaglio, P.0 tPlant physiology.g1998 Apr., v. 116, no. 4 p.1323-1331dAmerican Society of Plant PhysiologistsaPlant physiology (Lancaster, Pa.)x0032-08897nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.plantphysiol.org/3electronic resource  a20050129b20050130c00000000  aINDdMKS  aOther US 7aarticle02462naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001400110245003700124300001600161500002400177500001500201520106700216650000901283650002301292650000801315650001001323650001001333650002001343650001201363650002601375650001501401650002301416650002601439650002301465650002401488651001901512653001001531653002201541653002001563653002801583653002201611653001401633700001701647700001901664773013801683852000901821856005701830930003301887945001301920946001101933655001201944IND2181143120221121005359.0981118s1997    enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND218114312DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShine, A.10aConsumer use of nutrition labels  ap. 290-296.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aIncreasing consumer interest in nutrition has led to an increased interest in nutrition labelling. Finds that over half (58 per cent) of the sample surveyed read nutrition labels. Nutrition labelling was found to have an impact on consumer purchase decisions. Of those consumers who read nutritional labels, 81 per cent them in their evaluation of food products. Consumers have to deduce information from nutrition labels in their current format. Survey findings reinforce previous work carried out in this area, particularly in the context of consumer categorization of food products as "good" or "bad". For example, consumer avoidance of "negative" nutrients is apparent throughout the survey. The majority of respondents, who read labels, indicated that they search out information on nutrients they wish to avoid. In general, since time allocated to shopping for food products is limited, the format of nutritional labelling needs further consideration and improvement. The concept of nutrition should be incorporated into food companies' marketing strategy. 3adiet 3aDietary Guidelines 3amen 3afoods 3awomen 3afood purchasing 3asurveys 3anutrition information 3ademography 3aconsumer attitudes 3aconsumer satisfaction 3anutrition labeling 3anutrition knowledge 3aIrish Republic 0ausage 0apurchasing habits 0acharacteristics 0afood product attributes 0ainformation needs 0aconsumers1 aO'Reilly, S.1 aO'Sullivan, K.0 tBritish food journal.g1997, v. 99, no. 8/9 p.290-296dBritish Food JournalaBritish food journal (Croydon, England)x0007-070X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.emerald-library.com/3electronic resource  a20050224b20050301c00000000  aINDdLDP  aNon-US 7aarticle02617naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001800145245007200163300001600235500002400251500001500275520098700290650002401277650002101301650001501322650002001337650002201357650001201379650002701391650002601418650001601444650001901460650001401479650002201493650001801515650002301533650002001556650001301576650001601589650001301605651001001618653001401628653001601642653001601658653001701674700001601691773013601707852000901843856008501852856005701937930003301994945001302027946001102040655001202051IND2181147320221120151553.0981118s1997    enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND218114732DNAL7 a10.1108/000707097101793632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNyariki, D.M.10aHousehold food insecurity in sub-Saharan Africa: lessons from Kenya  ap. 249-262.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aDespite the widely acknowledged prognosis that the danger of unrelenting hunger and famine looms large in sub-Saharan Africa and that there is a constant need for donors to provide much required food relief, there is a paucity of literature based on comprehensive empirical work at the household or individual level. Based on data collected across two years and two locations in rural Kenya, attempts to develop further the literature on household food security. Food balances are computed and various approaches to food poverty analysis are employed by setting a very low poverty line to determine the proportion of households whose members would require external food support. Results show that per capita food production is low and varies with rainfall and food poverty and inequality in distribution are high. A great deal could be done, therefore, in the sphere of livelihood opportunities to enhance household purchasing power and hence effective demand and food distribution. 3amathematical models 3ahousehold income 3ahouseholds 3acrop production 3ahousehold surveys 3apoverty 3ageographical variation 3ahousehold expenditure 3afarm income 3asupply balance 3alivestock 3afood availability 3afood security 3aseasonal variation 3afood production 3afood aid 3arural areas 3aland use 3aKenya 0aresources 0afood supply 0aconsumption 0adistribution1 aWiggins, S.0 tBritish food journal.g1997, v. 99, no. 7 p.249-262dBritish Food JournalaBritish food journal (Croydon, England)x0007-070X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1108/000707097101793633Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://www.emerald-library.com/3electronic resource  a20050224b20050301c00000000  aINDdLDP  aNon-US 7aarticle01574naa a2200313 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100001700115245008800132300001400220500001500234520070900249650000900958650002200967650001400989650001601003651001101019653001101030653001701041700001701058773011201075852000901187939003301196945000801229946001101237655001201248991618463940742620221120151429.0840123s1983    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aAGE849229522DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVeeman, M.M.10aInflation and Canadian agriculture: effects on efficiency, productivity, and equity  ap. 45-49.  a2019-12-06  aExtract: In this paper the authors assess some of the economic impacts of inflation on Canadian agriculture in an attempt to isolate major influences and their effects. The authors consider effects on the prices of farmland, the increased risk and uncertainty affecting the industry, and a possible deterioration in the terms of trade between agriculture and the rest of the economy. The authors assess the effect of these and other inflation related influences on efficiency, productivity, and equity in the Canadian agricultural sector. The general conclusion of the paper is that the impacts of inflation on efficiency and productivity appear to have been minor compared to its distributional effects. 3arisk 3aagricultural land 3ainflation 3aland values 3aCanada 0aEquity 0aproductivity1 aVeeman, T.S.0 tI.A.A.E. occasional paper - International Association of Agricultural Economists.g1983, v. 3 p.45-497nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19840123c00000000  aAGE  aNon-US 7aarticle02876naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002000152245009100172300001800263500002400281500001500305520167300320650001401993650001802007650001402025650001102039650002302050650002302073650001302096650001302109650001102122650001602133650000902149651001002158653002202168700002002190700001802210700002202228700002102250773010702271852000902378856005502387655001202442IND4444945920221120151350.0101105e201011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444494592DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2109.2009.02460.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShi, Yong‐Hai10aEffects of temperature on fertilized eggs and larvae of tawny puffer Takifugu flavidus  ap. 1741-1747.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aTawny puffer Takifugu flavidus is a species found in China considered to have potential for aquaculture. Experiments were conducted to determine the optimal temperature for its incubation and larval culture. Fertilized eggs collected from cultured broodstocks that were induced to ovulate with a [d‐Ala⁶‐Pro⁹‐Net]‐luteinizing hormone‐releasing hormone analogue were inseminated. The effect of temperature (19, 20, 23, 26 and 29 °C) on the hatch rate, incubation period, viability of 24 h post‐hatch larvae and total mortality rate was assessed. The effect of temperature (20, 23, 26 and 29 °C) on the growth and survival of larvae from 3 to 19 days after hatching (dah) was also assessed. The results showed that the optimal temperature for successful development of fertilized eggs ranged from 23 to 26 °C, and the highest hatch rate, the optimal viability of 24 h post‐hatch larvae and the lowest total mortality rate were all predicted using quadratic equations. The relationship between temperature and the incubation period of tawny puffer eggs was determined using the effective degree‐day model. The temperature at developmental zero (t₀) was 11.34 °C, and the sum of effective degree‐days (k) was 52.356. The survival rate of tawny puffer larvae at 20 °C was significantly lower than among 23, 26 and 29 °C, whereas the survival rate was not significantly different from that at 23, 26 and 29 °C. The larval growth rate increased rapidly as the temperature increased, showing a linear relationship in the range of temperatures investigated. The optimal temperature for larval culture ranged from 23 to 29 °C. 3aviability 3asurvival rate 3aequations 3amodels 3alarval development 3asynthetic hormones 3aTakifugu 3ahatching 3alarvae 3atemperature 3aeggs 3aChina 0aincubation period1 aZhang, Gen‐Yu1 aZhu, Ya‐Zhu1 aLiu, Jian‐Zhong1 aZang, Wei‐Ling0 tAquaculture research.g2010 Nov., v. 41, no. 12 p.1741-1747dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx1355-557X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2109.2009.02460.x 7aarticle02997naa a2200673 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003900111040001800150072000900168072000900177072000900186072000900195100001400204245010400218300001600322500002400338500001500362520116400377650001501541650001501556650002301571650001901594650003101613650001401644650001901658650001201677650002401689650003401713650002101747650001701768650002401785650002301809650002301832650001601855650001201871650001701883650002501900650000801925650001301933650001701946650001201963650000701975650001001982650001701992653001102009700001702020700001802037700001702055773008802072852000902160856007302169930003302242945002502275946001102300655001202311IND4380552520221119170847.0060601e200608  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438055252DNAL7 a220625562pmid7 a10.1016/j.meatsci.2006.02.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ102 0aQ112 0aQ302 0aQ5021 aCilla, I.10aDry-cured ham quality and acceptability as affected by the preservation system used for retail sale  ap. 581-589.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aDry-cured ham cuts and slices were stored at 4 +/- 2 °C for 8 months under vacuum and modified atmosphere (20% CO2 + 80% N2), respectively. Instrumental colour and texture, pH, non-protein nitrogen, total volatile basic nitrogen, acidity, lipid oxidation, sensory profile and consumer acceptability and purchase satisfaction were measured throughout storage. The overall quality of vacuum-packaged dry-cured ham cuts showed limited changes. Significant changes of sensory attributes involved only loss of flavour. The overall acceptability assessed by both trained and consumer panels did not decrease significantly throughout storage and the willingness to purchase remained above 50%. Conversely, modified-atmosphere-packaged ham slices had intense and extensive changes affecting sensory quality, particularly in visual appearance, flavour loss, off-flavour formation, saltiness and rancidity. Some of these changes were related to oxidation caused by low pH due to the presence of carbon dioxide in the protective atmosphere. Acceptability was significantly lower from the 4th month of storage and willingness to purchase fell below 50% at the same time. 3adried meat 3ashelf life 3alipid peroxidation 3afood packaging 3avolatile organic compounds 3asaltiness 3acarbon dioxide 3atexture 3aconsumer acceptance 3amodified atmosphere packaging 3avacuum packaging 3afood storage 3anonprotein nitrogen 3atitratable acidity 3afood acceptability 3acured meats 3acutting 3astorage time 3aappearance (quality) 3aham 3anitrogen 3ameat quality 3aslicing 3apH 3acolor 3acold storage 0aflavor1 aMartinez, L.1 aBeltran, J.A.1 aRoncales, P.0 tMeat science.g2006 Aug., v. 73, no. 4 p.581-589dElsevier Sciencex0309-17407nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.meatsci.2006.02.0133electronic resource  a20060813b20060906c00000000  aINDdPNNe2006/08/11  aNon-US 7aarticle02841naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024004400110040001800154100001600172245010300188300001600291520165200307650002301959650001001982650001101992650001602003650001702019650001702036650002002053650005802073650001402131650003602145650002302181773009102204852000902295856009402304930003302398945001302431946001102444655001202455IND2039225320221119171008.0940503e199311  gw |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203922532DNAL7 a82434732pmid7 a10.1111/j.1432-1033.1993.tb18374.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCornish, K.14aThe separate roles of plant cis and trans prenyl transferases in cis-1,4-polyisoprene biosynthesis  ap. 267-271.  aIn plants, the elongation of cis-1,4-polyisoprene [natural rubber, M(r) > 10(6)] requires a small trans-allylic diphosphate [less than or equal to C(20)] initiator. The trans-allylic diphosphates are hydrophilic cytosolic compounds, whereas cis-1,4-polyisoprene is hydrophobic and compartmentalized in subcellular rubber particles. In this paper, it is demonstrated that soluble trans-prenyl transferase from latex of Hevea brasiliensis functions solely as farnesyl diphosphate synthase, and plays no direct role in cis-1,4-polyisoprene elongation. The cis-1,4-prenyl transferase is firmly associated with the H. brasiliensis rubber particle, as is also the case in other rubber-producing species [Archer, B. L., Audley, B. G., Cockbain, E. G. & McSweeney, G. P. (1963) Biochem. J. 89, 565-574; Madhavan, S., Greenblatt, G. A., Foster, M. A. & Benedict, C. R. (1989) Plant Physiol 89, 506-511; Siler, D. J. & Cornish, K. (1993) Phytochemistry, 32, 1097-1102]. The experimental data explain and refute previous reports in which soluble trans-prenyl transferase isolated from H. brasiliensis latex was attributed both trans-prenyl transferase and cis-prenyl transferase activities [Light, D. R. & Dennis, M. S. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 18589-18597; Light, D. R., Lazarus, R. A. & Dennis, M. S. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 18598-18607]. Thus, it appears that plant prenyl transferases are comparable to animal enzyme systems in which trans-prenyl transferases are soluble enzymes whilst cis-prenyl transferases are membrane-bound [Ericcson, J., Runquist. M., Thelin, A., Andersson, M., Chojnacki, T. & Dallner, G. (1992) J.

Leaf wetness after inoculation, temperature, and plant growth stage had significant effects on infection and disease development. The highest infection frequency occurred with a wetness period of 24 or 48 h. For all cultivars, latent periods were shortest (6-7 days) at 20 C and longest (13-14 days) at 10 C. Temperature had little effect on lesion size and number of pycnidia per lesion, but infection frequency was higher at 10 and 15 C than at 25 C. The lowest number of lesions and pycnidia and the smallest lesions occurred on Indianhead at 10, 15, and 20 C. Lesions were fewer and smaller and contained fewer pycnidia on Laird than on Eston at 15 and 20 C but not at 10 C. On stems, the highest number of lesions and pycnidia and the largest lesions were produced on Laird at all temperatures. Based on results of growth chamber and field tests, tissues below the top four or five nodes on the main stem and secondary branches were almost completely resistant in all three cultivars. The effect of this tissueage-related resistance on disease severity was most apparent at the podding stage. 3aLens culinaris 3aAscochyta fabae 3aplant pathogenic fungi 3apathogenicity 3apathogenesis 3aleaves 3awater content 3atemperature 3adevelopmental stages 3acultivars 3adisease resistance 0asymptoms1 aMorrall, R.A.A.0 tPhytopathology.g1994 Oct., v. 84, no. 10 p.1024-1030x0031-949X7nnas  aDNAL  a19950404b19950410c00000000  aINDdMKS  aOther US 7aarticle03238naa a2200637 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024004400110040001800154100001700172245013600189300001600325520117500341650002901516650001401545650002501559650002101584650002501605650002501630650002001655650002701675650002301702650002401725650001801749650002301767650001601790650002201806650002101828650001801849650003301867650002401900650007401924650002801998650001302026650005902039650001302098650004102111650003402152650001202186653002302198653001602221653001202237653002802249653001902277700001802296700002202314773009202336852000902428856009402437930003302531945001302564946001102577655001202588IND2038681020221119170807.0940411e199309  gw |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203868102DNAL7 a84049052pmid7 a10.1111/j.1432-1033.1993.tb18207.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVuorio, O.E.10aCloning of two related genes encoding the 56-kDa and 123-kDa subunits of trehalose synthase from the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae  ap. 849-861.  aPreparations of intact trehalose synthase contain three polypeptides with molecular masses of 56, 102 and 123 kDa. We have cloned the genes TSS1 and TSL1 coding for the 56- and 123-kDa subunits, respectively. These genes are located on chromosomes II (TSS1) and XIII (TSL1). The TSS1 gene was found to be identical with CIF1, a gene required for normal growth on glucose. The product of the entire TSS1 gene exibits 37% identity with a 502-amino-acid stretch from the middle of the TSL1 product. Disruption of the TSS1 gene in yeast eliminates both trehalose 6-phosphate synthase (Tre6P synthase) and trehalose 6-phosphate phosphatase (Tre6Pase) activities, and reintroduction of this gene restores these activities. Transformation of Escherichia coli with TSS1 increases its Tre6P synthase activity. Specific proteolytic degradation of the 123-kDa polypeptide from the N-terminus greatly influences the Tre6P synthase activity, decreasing its inhibition by phosphate and activatability by fructose 6-phosphate but has little effect on the Tre6Pase activity. These results suggest that this N-terminal part confers regulatory properties upon the Tre6P synthase activity. 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3atrehalose 3aglycosyltransferases 3astructural genes 3anucleotide sequences 3aamino acid sequences 3aenzyme activity 3agenetic transformation 3asequence alignment 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aBase Sequence 2aCloning, Molecular 2aDNA, Fungal 2aEnzyme Activation 2aEscherichia coli 2aGenes, Fungal 2aGenetic Complementation Test 2aGlucosexmetabolism 2aGlucosyltransferasesxantagonists & inhibitorsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aMutation 2aPhosphoric Monoester Hydrolasesxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aPlasmids 2aSaccharomyces cerevisiaexenzymology 2aSequence Homology, Amino Acid 2aTrypsin 0agenetic regulation 0acomparisons 0acloning 0amolecular sequence data 0agenbank/x727881 aKalkkinen, N.1 aLondesborough, J.0 tEuropean journal of biochemistry.g1993 Sept., v. 216, no. 3 p.849-861x0014-29567nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1432-1033.1993.tb18207.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a19940504b19940511c00000000  aINDdGHK  aNon-US 7aarticle02857naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003900111040001800150072000900168072000900177072000900186100001400195245013100209300001600340500002400356500001500380520141800395650002401813650001401837650002001851650003001871650001901901650001301920650002001933650000901953650001601962650001301978650001401991650001402005650001102019653002402030653001002054653002002064700001602084773008802100852000902188856007302197930003302270945002502303946001102328655001202339IND4380551720221119170901.0060601e200608  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438055172DNAL7 a220625502pmid7 a10.1016/j.meatsci.2006.02.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ102 0aQ502 0aX1001 aBrown, T.14aThe effect of air temperature, velocity and visual lean (VL) composition on the tempering times of frozen boneless beef blocks  ap. 545-552.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aBeef blocks of two compositions, 100% and 50% visual lean (VL), in standard commercial packaging with nominal dimensions of 510 x 390 x 150 mm were tempered from -18 °C to -3°C using air at temperatures from 3°C to -3°C and velocities of 0.5 and 5 ms-1. These conditions were then modelled using a finite difference mathematical model and the accuracy of the model assessed by comparison with the experimental results. An extended range of conditions (including an intermediate air velocity of 2 ms-1 and an intermediate composition of 75% VL) was then modelled to produce data that can be used to design tempering processes. The results show that single stage air tempering of even single blocks within their cartons needs to be a long process. In air at 3°C and 5 ms-1, blocks of 50% VL rose to deep temperatures of -10°C and -3°C after 4.0 and 22.5 h, respectively, while with 100% VL 4.6 and 27.3 h were required. Under these conditions, the surface layers of the meat would have spent many hours in a thawed condition that would be detrimental to both drip and optimal processing. Using lower temperatures avoids thawing and at the same time produces an optimum temperature difference for subsequent processing. However, tempering times are substantially extended. For example, times to the above temperatures using air at-1°C and 5 ms-1 were 4.8 and 37.5 h for 50% VL and 5.1 and 44.5 h for 100% VL. 3apackaging materials 3atempering 3aair temperature 3aheat transfer coefficient 3afood packaging 3avelocity 3aprocessed foods 3abeef 3afrozen meat 3aair flow 3ameat cuts 3alean meat 3aboning 0aphysical properties 0aboxes 0afood processing1 aJames, S.J.0 tMeat science.g2006 Aug., v. 73, no. 4 p.545-552dElsevier Sciencex0309-17407nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.meatsci.2006.02.0063electronic resource  a20060810b20060906c00000000  aINDdPNNe2006/08/10  aNon-US 7aarticle03723naa a2200673 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024004400110040001800154100001600172245014300188300001400331500001500345520155500360650002101915650001801936650001101954650002201965650003701987650003402024650002002058650001902078650001202097650001402109650001802123650003002141650001202171650004002183650002202223650006702245650004002312650002502352650001002377650002702387650007002414650002002484650003602504650004402540650002602584650002302610653001702633653001202650653001402662653002602676653001402702653002102716653001802737700001702755700001602772773008902788852000902877856009402886930003302980945001303013946001103026655001203037IND2037461220221119170850.0940223e199308  gw |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203746122DNAL7 a83654182pmid7 a10.1111/j.1432-1033.1993.tb18117.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBentrop, J.13aAn arrestin homolog of blowfly photoreceptors stimulates visual-pigment phosphorylation by activating a membrane-associated protein kinase  ap. 67-73.  a2019-12-04  aAn arrestin homolog (Arr2, 49-kDa protein) of blowfly (Calliphora erythrocephala) retinae undergoes light-dependent reversible binding to the photoreceptor membrane. In order to characterize this arrestin homolog and to study its function in a well-defined experimental system, we developed a purification scheme which used microvillar photoreceptor membranes as an affinity binding matrix. Additional purification steps included ammonium sulfate precipitation, gel filtration and binding to heparin-agarose. The molecular mass of purified Arr2, as judged by SDS/PAGE, is in the range 45-49 kDa. The isoelectric point, as judged by gel isolelectric focussing, is 8.7. Arr2 is specific to the retina, where it is subject to phosphorylation at multiple sites. Binding of purified Arr2 to isolated photoreceptor membranes efficiently activates the light-induced phosphorylation of visual pigment. Since the assay system used is deficient in rhodopsin phosphatase activity, the arrestin-stimulated phosphate incorporation into rhodopsin results solely from the activation of a protein kinase. Phosphorylation experiments with highly purified membrane preparations indicate that rhodopsin kinase is tightly associated with the rhabdomeric membrane or the microvillar cytoskeleton. Rhodopsin kinase is released from the membrane or inactivated upon treatment with urea. It is concluded that this arrestin is a regulator protein that controls visual-pigment phosphorylation by affecting the interaction of metarhodopsin and rhodopsin (metarhodopsin) kinase. 3abinding proteins 3arapid methods 3aretina 3aCalliphora vicina 3astructure-activity relationships 3aphosphotransferases (kinases) 3aphosphorylation 3aphotoreceptors 2aAnimals 2aArrestins 2aBinding Sites 2aCell Membranexenzymology 2aDiptera 2aElectrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel 2aEnzyme Activation 2aEye Proteinsxchemistryxisolation & purificationxmetabolism. 2aG-Protein-Coupled Receptor Kinase 1 2aIsoelectric Focusing 2aLight 2aMicrovillixmetabolism 2aPhosphoproteinsxchemistryxisolation & purificationxmetabolism. 2aPhosphorylation 2aPhotoreceptor Cellsxmetabolism 2aProtein Kinasesxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aRhodopsinxmetabolism 2aUreaxpharmacology 0apurification 0akinases 0amembranes 0arhabdomeric membranes 0arhodopsin 0arhodopsin kinase 0ametarhodopsin1 aPlangger, A.1 aPaulsen, R.0 tEuropean journal of biochemistry.g1993 Aug., v. 216, no. 1 p.67-73x0014-29567nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1432-1033.1993.tb18117.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a19940305b19940310c00000000  aINDdGHK  aNon-US 7aarticle03036naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003700092040001800129072000900147072000900156100001600165245007600181300001600257500002400273520172700297650002102024650001102045650002502056650003602081650001702117650002602134650002602160650002102186650001702207650001902224650001502243650002302258650002102281650001002302653002302312773007802335852000902413856008702422930003302509945002502542946001102567655001202578IND4380544620221119170808.0060601s2006    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438054462DNAL7 a10.1016/j.flora.2005.06.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF600 0aF4001 aManetas, Y.10aWhy some leaves are anthocyanic and why most anthocyanic leaves are red  ap. 163-177.  aIncludes references  aThe adaptive significance of leaf reddening, as it occurs during specific developmental stages or after stress, has puzzled biologists for more than a century. Theoretically, the accumulation of a non-photosynthetic pigment competing with chlorophylls for photon capture would impose a photosynthetic cost, which should be paid off by the benefits afforded by anthocyanins under some circumstances. Hence, the proposed hypotheses presume protective functions against excess light, UV-B radiation, reactive oxygen species, water stress (osmoregulation) and herbivory. The existing arguments in favor of an anti-oxidant, anti-UV-B and osmoregulatory role are confounded by the co-occurrence in leaves of other compounds having the same properties, not absorbing visible light, attaining much higher concentrations and, in some cases, having a more appropriate location to fulfill the ascribed functions. Moreover, the excess light hypothesis should take into account that anthocyanins mainly absorb green photons, which are used photosynthetically in deeper cell layers needing less photoprotection. The more ecological, anti-herbivore hypotheses, consider red leaf color as a signal denoting high defensive commitment, as a camouflage obscuring the green reflectance indicative of a healthy leaf and/or as a device undermining the folivorous insects camouflage. The anti-herbivore hypotheses have not been thoroughly tested, yet they are compatible with the known optical preferences of insects and their underlying physiology. Overall, although a multiplicity of potential roles can be argued, the primary role may depend on the reference system, i.e. species, developmental stage or specific biotic and abiotic stressors. 3aplant physiology 3aleaves 3adevelopmental stages 3achemical constituents of plants 3aanthocyanins 3aquantitative analysis 3aultraviolet radiation 3astress tolerance 3aantioxidants 3aosmoregulation 3aherbivores 3adefense mechanisms 3aplant morphology 3acolor 0aliterature reviews0 tFlora.g2006, v. 201, no. 3 p.163-177dG.

The longevity of P. minor seeds buried in bags in the field was often limited to less than 1 year, although many seeds buried at 30 cm depth in a rice-wheat rotation remained viable for longer. The application of direct seeding in wheat reduced the seedling emergence rate of P. minor, when compared with conventional ploughing and sowing. However, a larger P. minor seedbank in the upper soil layer in plots under direct seeding partly reversed this positive effect in one of the two studies. Besides differences in relative distribution of weed seeds through the soil profile, it was likely that other factors such as reduced soil disturbance and soil characteristics associated with the application of direct seeding were also involved in regulating the emergence rate. Mature P. minor plants in wheat were found to invest a stable part (27%) of their aboveground biomass in seed, so that total seed weight was strongly linearly correlated with the aboveground biomass of the mother plant. Individual seed weight, however, was little affected by the weight of the mother plant. 3aPhalaris minor 3aaboveground biomass 3abags 3aburied seeds 3adirect seeding 3adisturbed soils 3alongevity 3aplowing 3aseedling emergence 3asoil profiles 3aweeds 3awheat 3aIndia 0aRice-wheat system 0aseed longevity1 aSingh, S.1 aMCROBERTS, N.1 aNEHRA, A.S.1 aGODARA, S.1 aMALIK, R.K.1 aMARSHALL, G.0 tWeed research.g2007 Feb., v. 47, no. 1 p.73-83dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0043-17377nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-3180.2007.00533.x3electronic resource  a20070122b20070202c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02858naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001700152245008700169300001600256520154500272650002001817650001501837650001501852650001701867650002101884650002201905650001701927650002501944650001101969650001901980650001301999650001002012651001002022653002502032653001502057653002702072653001802099700002702117700001702144773011002161852000902271856007602280930003302356946001102389655001202400IND4389690720221119171254.0070325e200704  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438969072DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-3180.2007.00551.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMENENDEZ, J.10aCharacterisation of a triazine-resistant biotype of Bromus tectorum found in Spain  ap. 113-121.  aA population of Bromus tectorum infesting an olive grove at Córdoba (Spain) survived simazine use rates of 3.0 kg a.i. ha⁻¹ over two consecutive years. Non-tillage olive monoculture and two annual simazine applications had been carried out for 10 years. The resistant biotype showed a higher ED₅₀ value (7.3 kg a.i. ha⁻¹) than that of the susceptible control (0.1 kg a.i. ha⁻¹), a 73-fold increase in herbicide tolerance. The use of fluorescence, Hill reaction, absorption, translocation and metabolism assays showed that simazine resistance in this biotype was caused by a modification of the herbicide target site, since chloroplasts from the resistant biotype of B. tectorum were more than 300 times less sensitive to simazine than those from the susceptible biotype. In addition, non-treated resistant plants of B. tectorum displayed a significant reduction in the QA to QB electron transfer rate when compared with the susceptible biotype, a characteristic that has been linked to several mutations in the protein D1 conferring resistance to PS II inhibiting herbicides. Resistant plants showed cross-resistance to other groups of triazine herbicides with the hierarchy of resistance level being methoxy-s-triazines >=chloro-s-triazines > methylthio-s-triazines > cis-triazines. The results indicate a naturally occurring target-site point mutation is responsible for conferring resistance to triazine herbicides. This represents the first documented report of target site triazine resistance in this downy brome biotype. 3aBromus tectorum 3aD1 protein 3aabsorption 3achloroplasts 3across resistance 3aelectron transfer 3afluorescence 3aherbicide resistance 3aolives 3apoint mutation 3asimazine 3aweeds 3aSpain 0aherbicide metabolism 0aresistance 0afluorescence induction 0aHill reaction1 aGONZALEZ-GUTIERREZ, J.1 aDE PRADO, R.0 tWeed research.g2007 Apr., v. 47, no. 2 p.113-121dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0043-17377nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-3180.2007.00551.x3electronic resource  a20070325b20070402c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02183naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003200092040001800124100002100142245010100163300001800264520110200282650000801384650002001392650003401412650001501446650001601461650001301477650002501490650001401515650001501529700002201544700002601566773009401592852000901686856008201695930003301777946001101810655001201821IND4413793420221119170851.0081212e200812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441379342DNAL7 a10.1002/elps.2008001262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKozlowski, Piotr10aNew applications and developments in the use of multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification  ap. 4627-4636.  aMultiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) is a commonly used technique for determining relative DNA sequence dosage (or copy number) in a complex DNA sample. Originally MLPA was designed as a copy number analysis tool for detecting disease-causing genomic mutations and has been successfully applied in the testing and identification of hundreds of genomic mutations in numerous genes including DMD, BRCA1, NF1, and TSC2. More recently, several modifications of the original technique have been implemented. Arguably the most important enhancement of MLPA has been probe generation by chemical synthesis, enabling the facile creation of novel probe sets for any desired application. Other newer applications of MLPA include methylation status determination, copy number analysis in segmentally duplicated regions, expression profiling, and transgene genotyping. MLPA has a potential major role in the analysis of common copy number variation in genome-wide association analyses, which may be enhanced by future improvements to increase throughput and lower costs, such as array-MLPA. 3aDNA 3aelectrophoresis 3agenome-wide association study 3agenotyping 3amethylation 3amutation 3anucleotide sequences 3asynthesis 3atransgenes1 aJasinska, Anna J.1 aKwiatkowski, David J.0 tElectrophoresis.g2008 Dec., v. 29, no. 23 p.4627-4636dWiley-VCH Verlagx0173-08357nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/elps.2008001263Available from publisher's Web site  a20081212b20090206c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02893naa a2200625 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001700128245005900145300001600204500001500220520105800235650002601293650001601319650001301335650002701348650002001375650002801395650001501423650002901438650002001467650001801487650001901505650003001524650002101554650002001575650003101595650001801626650004801644650003001692650003801722650002201760650002601782650002801808650004001836650001601876650003201892650002201924650004101946650003601987653002302023653001702046653001602063653001402079700001502093773008102108852000902189930003302198945001302231946001102244655001202255IND2056622920221119170804.0970421e199611  ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205662292DNAL7 a89805122pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBodeau, J.P.10aStructure and regulation of the maize Bronze2 promoter  ap. 599-609.  a2019-12-05  aThe maize Bronze2 (Bz2) gene encodes a glutathione S-transferase that is required for anthocyanin pigment accumulation. Two classes of regulatory proteins, R and C I, are required for transcriptional activation of Bz2 and several additional structural genes. Functional domains of the Bz2 promoter were identified using Bz2 promoter driven luciferase reporter genes electroporated into maize protoplasts together with R and C1 expression plasmids. Complete regulation was conferred by 224 nt of the Bz2 promoter. Within this region at least two separable regions are independently capable of conferring regulation by R and C1. Predicted regulatory elements corresponding to two classes of sequence motifs, the Myb-box homologous 'C1-motif', TAACTG/CAGTTA, and the G-box and E-box homologous 'A-motif', CACGTG, were shown to be important for full R and C1 activation of the Bz2 promoter. Expression of reconstructed Bz2 genes with mutated promoters was quantified using RNase protection, and this analysis confirmed results obtained using reporter genes. 3atranscription factors 3aprotoplasts 3aZea mays 3agenetic transformation 3arecombinant DNA 3aglutathione transferase 3aluciferase 3atranscription (genetics) 3agene expression 3abinding sites 3areporter genes 3asite-directed mutagenesis 3apromoter regions 3aelectroporation 2aAnthocyaninsxbiosynthesis 2aBase Sequence 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plantxgenetics 2aGenes, Reporterxgenetics 2aGlutathione Transferasexgenetics 2aIntronsxgenetics 2aLuciferasesxgenetics 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPromoter Regions, Geneticxgenetics 2aProtoplasts 2aRecombinant Fusion Proteins 2aSequence Deletion 2aTranscriptional Activationxgenetics 2aZea maysxgeneticsxmetabolism. 0agenetic regulation 0abz2 promoter 0amutagenesis 0adeletions1 aWalbot, V.0 tPlant molecular biology.g1996 Nov., v. 32, no. 4 p.599-609x0167-44127nnas  aDNAL  a20060204b00000000c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle03305naa a2200685 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001500128245015200143300001600295500001500311520125600326650002601582650002401608650002101632650002201653650002401675650002501699650002201724650001001746650002501756650001801781650001801799650001201817650001701829650002101846650002401867650001801891650002301909650003301932650002501965650002001990650001602010650002702026650004902053650002802102650001802130650002402148650002702172650003402199650003502233650003702268653001602305653002802321653001902349653002502368653001902393653001702412700001502429700001602444773008102460852000902541930003302550945001302583946001102596655001202607IND2056625020221119171115.0970421e199611  ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205662502DNAL7 a89805182pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYing, Z.T.10aOrganization and characterization of the ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase large subunit (epsilon)N-methyltransferase gene in tobacco  ap. 663-671.  a2019-12-05  aRibulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco) large subunit (LS) epsilonN-methyltransferase (Rubisco LSMT) catalyzes the posttranslational methylation of the epsilon-amino group of Lys-14 in the LS of Rubisco in many higher plant species including tobacco. The tobacco Rubisco LSMT gene (rbcMT-T) and its cDNA were isolated, sequenced, and characterized. The gene contains 6 exons and spans about 6 kb. Primer extension analysis indicated one transcription start site located 93 nt upstream of the translation initiation site. Sequence analysis of the 5'-flanking region suggests several potential binding sites for transcription factors, including 7 GT-1 elements and an HSP-70.5 element. Gene dosage analysis by Southern hybridization demonstrated that the tobacco rbcMT-T gene is present as a single copy in the tobacco haploid genome. The full-length cDNA for tobacco rbcMT-T is 1974 nt in length excluding the 3' poly(A)15 tail, and encodes a 491 amino acid polypeptide with a molecular mass of ca. 56 kDa. The deduced amino acid sequence of tobacco Rubisco LSMT has 64.5% identity and 75.3% similarity with the sequence of pea Rubisco LSMT, and both proteins contain several copies of a conserved imperfect leucine-rich repeat motif. 3atranscription factors 3arestriction mapping 3astructural genes 3acomplementary DNA 3aopen reading frames 3aamino acid sequences 3aNicotiana tabacum 3aexons 3aDNA-binding proteins 3abinding sites 3aPisum sativum 3aintrons 3atransferases 3apromoter regions 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aBase Sequence 2aCloning, Molecular 2aDNA, Complementaryxgenetics 2aDNA, Plantxgenetics 2aExonsxgenetics 2aGene Dosage 2aGenes, Plantxgenetics 2aHistone-Lysine N-Methyltransferasexgenetics 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPlants, Toxic 2aRestriction Mapping 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 2aSequence Homology, Amino Acid 2aTobaccoxenzymologyxgenetics. 2aTranscription, Geneticxgenetics 0acomparisons 0amolecular sequence data 0agenbank/u35620 0anucleotide sequences 0agenbank/u35619 0arbcmt-t gene1 aJanney, N.1 aHoutz, R.L.0 tPlant molecular biology.g1996 Nov., v. 32, no. 4 p.663-671x0167-44127nnas  aDNAL  a19970501b19970508c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle02429naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003600092040001800128072000900146100002300155245011500178300001600293500002400309500001500333520106900348650002101417650001401438650001901452650002001471650001401491650000901505650001701514650001901531650001401550650002601564653003801590653002501628700002501653700001601678700001501694773009801709852000901807856008601816930003301902945002501935946001101960655001201971IND4444535620221119170853.0101105e201012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444453562DNAL7 a10.1016/j.rvsc.2010.04.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL8321 aPraveena, P.

Infected mice were dull, anorectic and depressed. A transient leukocytopenia followed by progressive leukocytosis was observed in the course of infection. Serum cytokine profiles showed significantly (P < 0.01) higher amount of pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6 and mouse KC) in the infected mice when compared to control mice. The circulating lymphocytes were apoptotic on annexin V staining. Apoptotic nuclei were detected in splenocytes, hepatocytes and infiltrating leukocytes of the lungs on TUNEL staining. The lungs were grossly congested and hemorrhagic, and showed infiltration with polymorphonuclear cells at early and mononuclear cells in the late hours of infection. Alveolar epithelia, inter-alveolar septa and capillary endothelium of the lungs showed ultrastructural changes.

Eugenol depressed spontaneous and stimulus-evoked impulses recorded extracellularly in the abdominal nerve cord, with an almost complete block of spikes at 2x10(-3) M. Geraniol and citral had similar depressive effects but increased spontaneous firing at lower doses (threshold 2.5x10(-4) M). Similar effects occurred in dorsal unpaired median (DUM) neurons, recorded intracellularly in the isolated terminal abdominal ganglion of P. americana. Spontaneous firing was progressively reduced by increasing concentrations of eugenol, whereas geraniol and citral produced biphasic effects (excitation at 10(-4) M, depression at 2x10(-3) M). All three oils decreased excitability of silent DUM neurons that were depolarised by applied current, but eugenol (at 10(-3) M) also changed the firing pattern from single spikes to bursts driven by plateau potentials. All oils reduced spike undershoot. Low doses of citral and geraniol (threshold ca. 10(-4) M) reversibly increased the frequency of spontaneous foregut contractions and abolished them at 2x10(-3) M (together with response to electrical stimulation). Eugenol reversibly reduced spontaneous activity at 10(-4) M and above. Eugenol has been reported to exert its insecticidal properties via a low-dose activation of octopamine receptors. In our studies, however, octopamine was found to have opposing effects to eugenol on DUM neurons and foregut activity (excitatory in both). Furthermore, eugenol did not affect the response to octopamine in DUM neurons. These results suggest that reported effects of eugenol were on a different sub-type of octopamine receptor. 3aPeriplaneta americana 3aBlaberus discoidalis 3aoctopamine 3aeugenol 3ageraniol 3acitral 3ainsecticidal properties 3aventral nerve cord 3aforegut 3amuscle contraction 3aneurons 3aelectrophysiology 3adose response 2aAnimals 2aCockroachesxdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aDigestive Systemxdrug effectsxinnervation. 2aElectrophysiology 2aEugenolxpharmacology 2aIn Vitro Techniques 2aMonoterpenesxpharmacology 2aNeuronsxdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aOctopaminexpharmacology 2aOils, Volatilexpharmacology 2aPeriplanetaxdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aPlant Oilsxpharmacology 2aTerpenesxpharmacology1 aBerry, M.S.0 tJournal of insect physiology.g2006 Mar., v. 52, no. 3 p.309-319dPergamonx0022-19107nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jinsphys.2005.11.0103electronic resource  a20060615b20060702c00000000  aINDdNZMe2006/06/12  aNon-US 7aarticle03125naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004000111040001800151072000900169072000900178072000900187100001700196245016000213300001600373500002400389520140200413650002101815650001501836650001701851650001501868650001901883650001901902650001601921650001501937650001201952650001601964650003101980650002002011650003502031650002502066650001902091650002202110653002702132653002402159653002102183653001902204653001802223700001402241700001702255700001502272773009602287852000902383856007402392930003302466945002502499946001102524655001202535IND4380480420221119170933.0060526e200603  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438048042DNAL7 a164124582pmid7 a10.1016/j.jinsphys.2005.11.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF851 0aL600 0aL0011 aHansen, L.L.10aMetabolic changes associated with active water vapour absorption in the mealworm Tenebrio molitor L. (Coleoptera, Tenebrionidae): A microcalorimetric study  ap. 291-299.  aIncludes references  aWater vapour absorption (WVA) is an important mechanism for water gain in several xeric insects. Theoretical calculations indicate that the energetic cost of WVA should be small (5-10% of standard metabolic rate) assuming realistic efficiencies. In this study we explored the relationship between WVA, metabolic heat flux (HFmet.) and CO2 release in larvae of Tenebrio molitor using microcalorimetry. By comparing metabolic heat flux with the catabolic rate estimated from VCO2, we were able to differentiate anabolic and catabolic rates prior to and during WVA, while simultaneously monitoring water exchange. Three to four hours before the onset of WVA, larvae showed clear increases in HFmet. and catabolic flux, and a simultaneous decrease in anabolic flux. Following the onset of WVA, HFmet. decreased again until indistinguishable from control (non-absorbing) values. Possible factors contributing to the “preparatory phase” are discussed, including mobilization of Malpighian tubule transporters and muscular activity in the rectum. Absorbing larvae reduced the water activity of the calorimetric cell to 0.906, agreeing with gravimetric estimates of the critical equilibrium activity. Periods of movement during WVA coincided with decreased uptake fluxes, consistent with the animal's hydrostatic skeleton and the need to close the anus to generate pressure increases in the haemocoel. 3aTenebrio molitor 3ametabolism 3awater uptake 3aabsorption 3awater activity 3acarbon dioxide 3acalorimetry 2aAbsorption 2aAnimals 2aCalorimetry 2aCarbon Dioxidexmetabolism 2aHot Temperature 2aMalpighian Tubulesxmetabolism 2aTenebrioxmetabolism 2aVolatilization 2aWaterxmetabolism 0awater vapor absorption 0ametabolic heat flux 0amicrocalorimetry 0acatabolic rate 0aanabolic rate1 aWesth, P.1 aWright, J.C.1 aRamlov, H.0 tJournal of insect physiology.g2006 Mar., v. 52, no. 3 p.291-299dPergamonx0022-19107nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jinsphys.2005.11.0083electronic resource  a20060615b20060702c00000000  aINDdNZMe2006/06/12  aNon-US 7aarticle02834naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001900110245007300129300001800202520189700220650002602117650003802143650001802181650002102199650001002220650001502230650002702245650002602272653001302298700001502311700001502326773007502341852000902416930003302425945001302458946001302471655001202484IND2045047720221119170920.0950314e199412  mnu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204504772DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBen-Yephet, Y.10aEffects of inoculum depth and density on fusarium wilt in carnations  ap. 1393-1398.  aThe effects of depth (0-30, 15-30, 30-45, 45-60, or 60-75 cm) and density (0, 6, 25, 120, 770, or 3,500 propagules per gram of soil) of Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. dianthi inoculum originating from naturally infested soil on wilt and flower yield in a highly susceptible cultivar of carnation (Dianthus caryophyllus 'Fantasia') were studied in concrete containers (100 X 50 cm) during three growing seasons. Depth of inoculum placement was related directly to time until symptom onset and inversely to the final percentage of plants that were infected. Rate of disease progress varied with depth of inoculum placement. At 15-30, 30-45, 45-60, or 60-75 cm, mean wilt incidence 185 days after planting was 50, 45, 33, or 22%, respectively. Flower yields were correlated with depth of inoculum. Mean yield losses were 15, 23, 31, and 39% when inoculum was placed at depths of 60, 45, 30, and 15 cm, respectively, relative to yield in pathogen-free soil. In experiments on the effect of inoculum density, time until symptom onset and final disease incidence were related inversely and directly, respectively, to propagule density. The rate of disease progress was the same at all propagule densities. At densities of 6, 25, 120, 770, and 3,500 propagules per gram of soil, mean percentages of infected plants 185 days after planting were 2, 5, 13, 34, and 57%, respectively. Flower yields were related inversely to inoculum density. The effects of inoculum depth and density on final disease incidence were fit by linear logistic models. At the end of the growing season, the vertical distribution of F. o. dianthi propagules through a 60-cm depth showed a similar trend whether the propagules had been placed at 0-30 cm or at 60-75 cm prior to planting. The number of propagules placed at various inoculum densities prior to planting had increased 10- to 100-fold by the end of the growing season. 3aDianthus caryophyllus 3aFusarium oxysporum f. sp. dianthi 3apathogenicity 3ainoculum density 3adepth 3acrop yield 3acontainer-grown plants 3agreenhouse production 0asymptoms1 aReuven, M.1 aGenizi, A.0 tPhytopathology.g1994 Dec., v. 84, no. 12 p.1393-1398x0031-949X7nnas  aDNAL  a19950404b19950410c00000000  aINDdMKS  aOther US 7aarticle02724naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001400110245011900124300001400243500001500257520157200272650001801844650001301862650001701875650001501892650002201907650002501929650003701954650002201991650003902013651001102052653002002063653002802083653001502111653003402126700001602160773007002176852000902246930003302255945001302288946001302301655001202314IND2044869120221119170838.0950301e199501  mnu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204486912DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYeh, S.D.10aNucleotide sequence of the N gene of watermelon silver mottle virus, a proposed new member of the genus Tospovirus  ap. 58-64.  a2019-12-05  aA virus isolated from watermelon was previously identified as tomato spotted wilt-like virus in the genus Tospovirus of the family Bunyaviridae. The virus, designated Tospo-W, contains a nucleocapsid (N) protein serologically unrelated to tomato spotted wilt virus (TSWV) or impatiens necrotic spot virus (INSV). In this study, double-stranded RNAs of TospoW were extracted from virus-infected tobacco and used for cDNA cloning. A cDNA clone, pWN12, that was selected from a cDNA library to the separated S dsRNA, contained 1,200 nucleotides including the entire N ORF that encodes a protein of 275 amino acids with a predicted Mr of 30,657. Comparison of the nucleic acid sequence of the Tospo-W N gene with those of the other five tospoviruses revealed that their identity percentages were 54.4-55.9%. The degrees of similarity at the amino acid level were only 39.6-46.1%. In vitro transcription and translation of the clone pWN12 generated a protein of 31 kDa, similar to the authentic N protein and reacted specifically with the antibody to the Tospo-W N protein. A nick-translated DNA probe from the insert of pWN 12 reacted with RNAs extracted from plants infected with Tospo-W or with a tospovirus isolate from melon, but not with RNAs from plants infected with three TSWV isolates or three INSV isolates. The low-degree homology of the N gene with other tospoviruses coupled with the lack of cross hybridization using a Tospo-W-specific cDNA probe suggests that TospoW, renamed as watermelon silver mottle virus, is a distinct member of the genus Tospovirus. 3aplant viruses 3ataxonomy 3aimmunoassays 3aDNA probes 3aCitrullus lanatus 3anucleotide sequences 3agenetic techniques and protocols 3agenetic variation 3aImpatiens necrotic spot tospovirus 3aTaiwan 0aOrthotospovirus 0amolecular sequence data 0aTospovirus 0aImpatiens necrotic spot virus1 aChang, T.F.0 tPhytopathology.g1995 Jan., v. 85, no. 1 p.58-64x0031-949X7nnas  aDNAL  a19950404b19950410c00000000  aINDdMKS  aOther US 7aarticle02546naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245011300127300001500240520139100255650001901646650002101665650002701686650001901713650001601732650001801748650002401766650001501790650001801805650002001823650003301843651001001876653001101886700001801897700001701915700001801932700001701950773008901967852000902056930003302065945001302098946001302111655001202124IND2044878120221119171057.0950301e199501  mnu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204487812DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBroome, J.C.10aDevelopment of an infection model for Botrytis bunch rot of grapes based on wetness duration and temperature  ap. 97-102.  aGrape berries were dipped in conidial suspensions of Botrytis cinerea and incubated for 4, 8, 12, 16, or 20 h of wetness at temperatures ranging from 12-30 C. Berries were infected after 4 h of wetness at all temperatures tested. Incidence of berry infection increased with increasing wetness duration at all temperatures. A multiple regression model described the logit of infection as a function of the interaction of wetness duration and temperature (R2 = 0.75). This model was incorporated into an infield environmental monitoring station and evaluated for two seasons on Thompson Seedless table grapes in the central valley of Chile. Applications of captan (3.2 kg/ha a.i.) or vinclozolin (1 kg/ha a.i.) were made according to the Botrytis model or a standard phenological spray program that consisted of four sprays (at bloom, cluster thinning, veraison, and preharvest) plus additional sprays after major rain events. Disease incidence and severity at harvest were similar whether applications were made according to a standard program (six to nine applications in 1991-1992, four to five in 1992-1993) or according to the Botrytis model (two to four applications in 1991-1992, zero to five in 1992-1993). In some vineyards, postharvest disease was significantly less when sprays were made according to the Botrytis model recommendations compared with the standard spray program. 3aVitis vinifera 3aBotrytis cinerea 3aplant pathogenic fungi 3adisease models 3atemperature 3awater content 3amathematical models 3afungicides 3apathogenicity 3adisease control 3aplant diseases and disorders 3aChile 0afruits1 aEnglish, J.T.1 aMarois, J.J.1 aLatorre, B.A.1 aAviles, J.C.0 tPhytopathology.g1995 Jan., v. 85, no. 1 p.97-102wJournal:jnl44575x0031-949X7nnas  aDNAL  a19950404b19950410c00000000  aINDdMKS  aOther US 7aarticle02913naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001100128245009800139300001600237520141900253650002201672650002001694650002301714650001801737650001801755650001001773650002301783650002001806650002101826650001801847650003001865650004301895650004201938650002801980650003002008650001802038650003402056650003302090650002402123650002702147650002202174653001102196700002302207700001802230773008102248852000902329930003302338945001302371946001102384655001202395IND2056626120221119171043.0970421e199611  ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205662612DNAL7 a89805212pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLu, Z.10aCharacterization of replication origins flanking the 23S rRNA gene in tobacco chloroplast DNA  ap. 693-706.  aUsing 5' end-labeled nascent strands of tobacco chloroplast DNA (ctDNA) as a probe, replication displacement loop (D-loop) regions were identified. The strongest hybridization was observed with restriction fragments containing the rRNA genes from the inverted repeat region. Two-dimensional gel analysis of various digests of tobacco ctDNA suggested that a replication origin is located near each end of the 7.1 kb BamHI fragment containing part of the rRNA operon. Analysis of in vitro replication products indicated that templates from either of the origin regions supported replication, while the vector alone or ctDNA clones from other regions of the genome did not support in vitro replication. Sequences from both sides of the BamHI site in the rRNA spacer region were required for optimal in vitro DNA replication activity. Primer extension was used for the first time to identify the start site of DNA synthesis for the D-loop in the rRNA spacer region. The major 5' end of the D-loop was localized to the base of a stem-loop structure which contains the rRNA spacer BamHI site. Primer extension products were insensitive to both alkali and RNase treatment, suggesting that RNA primers had already been removed from the 5' end of nascent DNA. Location of an origin in the rRNA spacer region of ctDNA from tobacco, pea and Oenothera suggests that ctDNA replication origins may be conserved in higher plants. 3aNicotiana tabacum 3achloroplast DNA 3areplication origin 3aribosomal DNA 3aribosomal RNA 3agenes 3achromosome mapping 3aDNA replication 2aBase Composition 2aBase Sequence 2aDNA Replicationxgenetics 2aDNA, Chloroplastxchemistryxgenetics. 2aElectrophoresis, Gel, Two-Dimensional 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aNucleic Acid Conformation 2aPlants, Toxic 2aRNA, Ribosomal, 23Sxgenetics 2aReplication Originxgenetics 2aRestriction Mapping 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 2aTobaccoxgenetics 0ad-loop1 aKunnimalaiyaan, M.1 aNielsen, B.L.0 tPlant molecular biology.g1996 Nov., v. 32, no. 4 p.693-706x0167-44127nnas  aDNAL  a19970501b19970508c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle02219naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245006800127300001400195520101300209650002001222650002401242650002701266650003201293650001201325650001301337650001801350650001001368650001801378650001301396650002001409650004101429650001701470653001501487653002301502653001101525700001701536700001501553700001601568700001201584700001501596773007001611852000901681930003301690945001301723946001301736655001201749IND2044870920221119171014.0950301e199501  mnu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204487092DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aParker, D.M.10aProduction and transformation of conidia of Venturia inaequalis  ap. 87-91.  aHigh yields of conidia of Venturia inaequalis were produced from either mycelial fragments or conidia on cellophane-covered surfaces of agar media incubated under continuous near-ultraviolet light. Optimal conditions required a cellophane-covered surface of potato-dextrose agar in combination with light and incubation for 1 wk. The procedure represents a convenient technique for the mass-production of clonal and sterile V. inaequalis conidia. Conidia were biolistically transformed to hygromycin B resistance with a plasmid (pOHT) containing a bacterial phosphotransferase gene spliced between regulatory elements from Aspergillus nidulans. Southern hybridization analysis showed that the plasmid was incorporated into heterologous regions of the genome. Hygromycin B-resistant transformants were mitotically stable during nonselective propagation. The heterologous gene conferring hygromycin B resistance was expressed during early stages of conidia germination and during vegetative growth of mycelium. 3aMalus domestica 3aVenturia inaequalis 3aplant pathogenic fungi 3ahost-parasite relationships 3aconidia 3amycelium 3aculture media 3alight 3agene transfer 3aplasmids 3agenetic markers 3aphosphotransferases (phosphomutases) 3ahygromycin B 0aresistance 0aculture techniques 0agrowth1 aHilber, U.W.1 aBodmer, M.1 aSmith, F.D.1 aYao, C.1 aKoller, W.0 tPhytopathology.g1995 Jan., v. 85, no. 1 p.87-91x0031-949X7nnas  aDNAL  a19950404b19950410c00000000  aINDdMKS  aOther US 7aarticle03428naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001500110245012900125300001400254520217000268650002202438650002002460650001702480650001502497650002102512650001802533650004502551650001502596650002202611650001502633650001302648650001402661651001802675653001302693653002302706653003902729700001702768700001602785700001802801700001302819773007002832852000902902930003302911945001302944946001302957655001202970IND2044868720221119171000.0950301e199501  mnu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204486872DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aUeng, P.P.10aCorrelation between molecular and biological characters in identifying the wheat and barley biotypes of Stagonospora nodorum  ap. 44-52.  aThirty-five isolates of Stagonospora nodorum from barley, wheat, and other hosts were identified as either the barley or wheat biotypes based on cultural characters and host specificity. Identification of the biotypes based on these phenotypic criteria was compared with genetic identification by analysis of restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs). Twenty-six probes randomly isolated from genomic DNA of a barley biotype isolate were used in the hybridization to differentiate the barley and wheat biotypes. Eighteen and 17 of the 26 probes detected no variation among 14 isolates of the barley biotype and 13 isolates of the wheat biotype, respectively, and unambiguously differentiated the two biotypes. Genetic distance, an estimate of accumulated number of allele substitutions per locus, is 2.286 between the barley and wheat biotypes. The genetic similarity was very high (>0.82) within each of the two biotypes and was very low (0.12) between the two biotypes. Clustering of the isolates based on individual hybridizing DNA bands correlated with biotype identification based on biological characters. The wheat and barley biotypes were then compared with isolates of Stagonospora avenae f. sp. triticea and an isolate of Stagonospora arenaria by hybridizing with 31 anonymous DNA probes (11 from a wheat biotype, 12 from a barley biotype, and eight from S. a. triticea). Two isolates of S. nodorum of unknown biotype, SN91-X and SNO38NY-89, used in a previous study, were considered to be the wheat biotype based on DNA banding patterns. Based on allele frequencies of the 31 RFLP loci, the estimated genetic distance between the barley biotype and the wheat biotype of S. nodorum was as great as between any of the two biotypes and S. a. triticea. Likewise, analysis based on discrete hybridizing bands showed that the barley biotype had a closer relationship with S. a. triticea than with the wheat biotype. Two probes from the barley biotype were specific for the barley biotype and did not detect any DNA bands in the wheat biotype. These barley biotype specific probes may be used as natural markers for identification of the barley biotype. 3aTriticum aestivum 3aHordeum vulgare 3aStagonospora 3apathotypes 3ahost specificity 3apathogenicity 3arestriction fragment length polymorphism 3aDNA probes 3agenetic variation 3ahost range 3agenomics 3aphenotype 3aUnited States 0asymptoms 0ageographical races 0astagonospora avenae f.sp. triticea1 aCunfer, B.M.1 aAlano, A.S.1 aYoumans, J.D.1 aChen, W.0 tPhytopathology.g1995 Jan., v. 85, no. 1 p.44-52x0031-949X7nnas  aDNAL  a19950404b19950410c00000000  aINDdMKS  aOther US 7aarticle03345naa a2200733 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001900128245005400147300001600201500001500217520123800232650002501470650001901495650001801514650002001532650002201552650001901574650002401593650001401617650002501631650002001656650002401676650001001700650001001710650001101720650002401731650002601755650002501781650001801806650005701824650003001881650002701911650003501938650001001973650002801983650002102011650002902032650004602061650002902107650002502136650002702161650003402188650002602222653001702248653001902265653002802284653002302312653001902335653001102354653001902365653002502384700002502409700001802434773008102452852000902533930003302542945001302575946001102588655001202599IND2056625220221119170926.0970421e199611  ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205662522DNAL7 a89805192pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSerikawa, K.A.10aThree knotted1-like homeobox genes in Arabidopsis  ap. 673-683.  a2019-12-05  aFive arabidopsis kn1-like homeobox genes were cloned through low-stringency screening of Arabidopsis cDNA libraries with the kn1 homeobox from maize. These five genes were named KNAT1-5 (for kn1-like Arabidopsis thaliana). An analysis of KNAT1 and 2 has been presented previously [19]. Here we present an analysis of the genes KNAT3, 4 and 5. On the basis of sequence and expression patterns, these three genes belong to the class II subfamily of kn1-like homeobox genes [16]. Low-stringency Southern analysis suggests several additional members of the class II genes exist in the Arabidopsis genome. The predicted amino acid sequences of the three genes share extensive homology outside of the homeodomain, including 84% between KNAT3 and KNAT4. Northern analysis shows that although all three genes are expressed in all tissues examined, the level of KNAT3 RNA is highest in young siliques, inflorescences and roots. KNAT4 RNA level is strongest in leaves and young siliques, and KNAT5 RNA level is highest in roots. The specificity of these patterns was confirmed by RNA fingerprint analysis. KNAT3 and 4 are light-regulated as they show reduced expression in etiolated seedlings and also in hy3, cop1 and det1 mutant backgrounds. 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3ainflorescences 3amessenger RNA 3aregulator genes 3acomplementary DNA 3ahomeotic genes 3aopen reading frames 3aseedlings 3aamino acid sequences 3agene expression 3aDNA-binding domains 3alight 3aroots 3aleaves 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aArabidopsisxgenetics 2aArabidopsis Proteins 2aBase Sequence 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plantxradiation effects 2aGenes, Homeoboxxgenetics 2aGenes, Plantxgenetics 2aHomeodomain Proteinsxgenetics 2aLight 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aNuclear Proteins 2aPlant Proteinsxgenetics 2aPolymorphism, Restriction Fragment Length 2aRNA, Messengerxanalysis 2aRNA, Plantxanalysis 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 2aSequence Homology, Amino Acid 2aTranscription Factors 0ahomeodomains 0agenbank/x92394 0amolecular sequence data 0agenetic regulation 0agenbank/x92392 0afruits 0agenbank/x92393 0anucleotide sequences1 aMartinez-Laborda, A.1 aZambryski, P.0 tPlant molecular biology.g1996 Nov., v. 32, no. 4 p.673-683x0167-44127nnas  aDNAL  a19970501b19970508c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle01606naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003100092040001800123100001900141245011300160300001600273500001500289520037800304650002400682650001600706650002700722650001600749650001400765651001300779651001600792653001300808653002500821653000900846653001300855653002900868700001700897700001700914773010400931852000901035856008101044930003301125945001301158946001301171655001201184IND2202621320221119170856.0000217e199907  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220262132DNAL7 a10.1093/aesa/92.4.4882doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStoetzel, M.B.10aReevaluation of the genus Hyalomyzus Richards with the description of two new species (Homoptera: Aphididae)  ap. 488-513.  a2019-12-04  aAlatae and apterae of the genus Hyalomyzus, including 2 new species, Hyalomyzus orphnophlebos n. sp. and Hyalomyzus pososinus n. sp., are described, illustrated, and keys are provided for identification.

Size and number of dsRNAs were determined by gel electrophoresis, and their genetic variability was determined by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and nucleotide sequencing. The New Jersey hypovirulent isolates were similar in cultural phenotype and electrophoretic characteristics of their dsRNAs. PCR amplification primed by oligonucleotides specific for a conserved region of a New Jersey-derived Cryphonectria hypovirus dsRNA (CHV2-NB58) for which the entire nucleotide sequence is known resulted in amplification of a single band of predicted size from all but one of the New Jersey dsRNAs. Neither the European-derived dsRNA, CHV1-EP713, nor a Rhode Island dsRNA amplified with these primers. The sequences of 400 nucleotides of PCR-amplified products primed by two oligonucleotides (200 residues from each primer) were determined. Alignments of these sequences with CHV1-EP713 and CHV2-NB58 and phylogenetic trees drawn from these alignments indicated that all New Jersey isolates were closely related and easily distinguishable from CHV1-EP713. In the region sequenced, none of the dsRNAs from fungal isolates from different trees were identical, however, CHV2-NB58 dsRNA isolated in 1992 was identical to the original 1988 CHV2-NB58 dsRNA from the same tree. This suggests that there is significant drift among dsRNA sequences even within a small C. parasitica population but that there is stability within a particular fungal thallus. 3aCastanea dentata 3achromosome mapping 3aplant pathogenic fungi 3agenetic variation 3apathotypes 3aRNA 3aCryphonectria parasitica 3avirulence 3aRhode Island 3aFrance 3aNew Jersey 3aConnecticut 0agenetic regulation 0apathogenicity1 aBedker, P.J.1 aHillman, B.I.0 tPhytopathology.g1994 Sept., v. 84, no. 9 p.984-990x0031-949X7nnas  aDNAL  a19950303b19950309c00000000  aINDdMKS  aOther US 7aarticle02361naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001500110245011000125300001600235500001500251520131100266650001901577650001601596650001301612650001501625650001801640650001301658650002301671650001401694650002201708653001401730653002101744653002501765700001401790700001801804773007301822852000901895930003301904945001301937946001301950655001201963IND2044433920221119170950.0950203e199409  mnu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204443392DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSong, H.S.10aSelection and regeneration of soybeans resistant to the pathogenic culture filtrates of Septoria glycines  ap. 948-951.  a2019-12-05  aSoybean plants resistant to a host-specific pathotoxic culture filtrate of Septoria glycines were regenerated by organogenesis from immature embryos of the cultivar BSR 201 and from mature seeds of three genotypes BSR 201, Fayette, and L1615. When the progeny obtained from immature embryos were evaluated for brown spot disease resistance in the field, the R2 (the second selfed generation of regenerated plants) and R3 resistant plants did not develop disease symptoms until the R6 growth stage. The incubation period of S. glycines in the resistant plants was at least 5 wk longer than the incubation period in susceptible plants. The resistant plants differed from their parental plants in height, maturity, growth habit, and fertility. Resistance to S. glycines culture filtrate continued to segregate in unexpected ways after several generations of selfing. Among the resistant plants obtained from mature seeds, only progeny from BSR 201 inherited disease resistance, and these plants were of normal height. The resistant plants obtained from immature embryos and mature seeds matured later than the parent. This study showed that soybean plants with resistance to S. glycines can be selected from cultured cells of brown spot-susceptible cultivars using pathotoxic culture filtrates of S. glycines. 3aplant breeding 3aGlycine max 3aSeptoria 3amycotoxins 3apathogenicity 3agenotype 3adisease resistance 3ascreening 3aculture filtrates 0aselection 0ain vitro culture 0aregenerative ability1 aLim, S.M.1 aWidholm, J.M.0 tPhytopathology.g1994 Sept., v. 84, no. 9 p.948-951x0031-949X7nnas  aDNAL  a19950303b19950309c00000000  aINDdMKS  aOther US 7aarticle02216naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110245010100128300001600229500001500245520104200260650002101302650003301323650002801356650002301384650002001407650001501427650002201442650002701464650004101491650002001532650004201552650001601594650002301610651001501633700001701648773007301665852000901738930003301747945001301780946001301793655001201806IND2044433820221119170805.0950203e199409  mnu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204443382DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPierson, E.A.10aUse of mixtures of fluorescent pseudomonads to suppress take-all and improve the growth of wheat  ap. 940-947.  a2019-12-05  aFluorescent Pseudomonas strains were tested alone and in combinations for the ability to suppress take-all in greenhouse and growth chamber tests and to enhance the growth and yield of wheat in fields infested with Gaeumannomyces graminis var. tritici. In general, certain combinations of strains enhanced yield, whereas other mixtures and strains used individually did not. Overall, the best combinations were Q2-87 plus Qlc-80 plus Q8d-80 plus Q65c-80, Q2-87 plus Qlc-80 plus Q8d-80 plus Q69c-80, and Qlc-80 plus Q8d-80 plus Q65c-80. For example, in a field test on spring-sown wheat at Pullman, WA, during 1989, the treatment Q2-87 plus Qlc-80 plus Q8d-80 plus Q65c-80 significantly (P = 0.05) increased yield 20.4% compared to a nontreated control, whereas each strain used individually had no significant effect on yield. This work demonstrates the potential benefits of using combination treatments to suppress takeall and suggests the importance of additive and interactive effects among introduced bacteria in biological control. 3agrowth promotion 3aplant diseases and disorders 3aPseudomonas fluorescens 3astrain differences 3adisease control 3acrop yield 3aTriticum aestivum 3aplant pathogenic fungi 3aGaeumannomyces graminis var. tritici 3acrop management 3aGaeumannomyces graminis var. graminis 3ametabolites 3abiological control 0aWashington1 aWeller, D.M.0 tPhytopathology.g1994 Sept., v. 84, no. 9 p.940-947x0031-949X7nnas  aDNAL  a20060204b00000000c00000000  aINDdMKS  aOther US 7aarticle02892naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002800110040001800138100001700156245009200173300001800265520134000283650002101623650002001644650002801664650001601692650001801708650001401726650001601740650002401756650002001780650001601800650001801816650002501834650001601859650001201875650003001887650004801917650003401965650001401999650002602013700001902039700002102058700001802079700001702097700001502114773007502129852000902204856007802213930003302291945001302324946001302337655001202350IND2047233620221119170915.0950810e199507  ilu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204723362DNAL7 a74794922pmid7 a10.3382/ps.07411592doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYarger, J.G.10aComparison of dietary 25-hydroxycholecalciferol and cholecalciferol in broiler chickens  ap. 1159-1167.  aWe conducted a series of 10 feeding trials involving over 36,000 broilers. The effects of various dietary levels of cholecalciferol (vitamin D3) or 25-hydroxycholecalciferol (25-OH-D3) were compared using a "basal" dosage level of 69 microgram/kg feed, as well as levels ranging from .5 to 1.5 times the basal level. For all 10 studies, average body weight increased by an average of .042 +/- .03 kg (P < .001) and adjusted feed efficiency decreased (improved) by an average of .026 +/- .0046 kg/kg (P < .001) in birds fed 25-OH-D3 in comparison to those fed vitamin D3 at the basal level. Changes in mortality were not detected. Evaluation of different dietary levels of 25-OH-D3 revealed a significant dose response relationship, with maximal effects on weight gain, feed efficiency, and breast meat yield being observed in the range of 50 to 70 microgram/kg feed. Preliminary studies with different levels of vitamin D3 suggested no additional benefits on weight gain or feed efficiency with higher dietary levels of vitamin D3. Serum 25-OH-D3 concentrations increased more rapidly in birds fed 25-OH-D3 than in birds fed vitamin D3. There were significant correlations with body weight, feed conversion, and serum 25-OH-D3 concentrations, with no correlations observed between serum 1,25-(OH)2D3 concentrations and these variables. 3abroiler chickens 3acholecalciferol 3ahydroxycholecalciferols 3ablood serum 3adose response 3amortality 3abody weight 3avitamin supplements 3afeed conversion 3acholesterol 3abreast muscle 2aAnalysis of Variance 2aAnimal Feed 2aAnimals 2aCalcifediolxpharmacology 2aChickensxgrowth & developmentxphysiology. 2aCholecalciferolxpharmacology 2aLongevity 2aVitamin Dxmetabolism1 aSaunders, C.A.1 aMcNaughton, J.L.1 aQuarles, C.L.1 aHollis, B.W.1 aGray, R.W.0 tPoultry science.g1995 July, v. 74, no. 7 p.1159-1167x0032-57917nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3382/ps.07411593Available from publisher's Web site  a19950905b19950912c00000000  aINDdJIT  aOther US 7aarticle02047naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245011500126300001600241500001500257520078500272650001201057650002101069650002201090650001601112650001601128650002601144650001401170650001901184650003501203650002101238651001901259651001601278651001101294651001001305651001101315651001001326653002301336653001301359653001301372653002501385700001501410773007201425852000901497930003301506945001301539946001301552655001201565IND2044405220221119171008.0950202e199404  mnu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204440522DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSalinas, J.10aMonoclonal antibodies-based immunofluorescence test for detection of conidia of Botrytis cinera on cut flowers  ap. 351-356.  a2019-12-05  aWhole conidia, their extracellular material, and a putative cutin esterase isolated from conidia of Bortrytis cinerea were used as antigens to raise monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) for the detection of conidia of B cinerea.

Here, we used ¹⁵N-¹H HSQC and pulse field gradient (PFG) NMR spectroscopy to demonstrate that galectin-1 (gal-1) binds to the relatively large galactomannan Davanat, whose backbone is composed of β1-4-linked D-mannopyranosyl units to which single D-galactopyranosyl residues are periodically attached via α1-6 linkage (weight-average MW of 59 kDa). The Davanat binding domain covers a relatively large area on the surface of gal-1 that runs across the dimer interface primarily on that side of the protein opposite to the lactose binding site. Our data show that gal-1 binds Davanat with an apparent equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd) of 10 x 10⁻⁶ M, compared to 260 x 10⁻⁶ M for lactose, and a stiochiometry of about 3 to 6 gal-1 molecules per Davanat molecule. Mannan also interacts at the same galactomannan binding domain on gal-1, but with at least 10-fold lower avidity, supporting the role of galactose units in Davanat for relatively strong binding to gal-1. We also found that the β-galactoside binding domain remains accessible in the gal-1/Davanat complex, as lactose can still bind with no apparent loss in affinity. In addition, gal-1 binding to Davanat also modifies the supermolecular structure of the galactomannan and appears to reduce its hydrodynamic radius and disrupt inter-glycan interactions thereby reducing glycan-mediated solution viscosity. Overall, our findings contribute to understanding gal-1-carbohydrate interactions and provide insight into gal-1 function with potentially significant biological consequences.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abinding sites 3acarbohydrate binding 3adissociation 3agalactomannans 3agalactose 3agalectins 3ahydrodynamics 3alactose 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aviscosity1 aKlyosov, Anatole1 aMayo, Kevin H.0 tGlycobiology.g2009 Sept., v. 19, no. 9 p.1034-1045x0959-66587nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/glycob/cwp0843Available from publisher's Web site  a20090808b00000000c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02643naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001900110245014200129300001600271500001500287520126800302650001501570650003301585650001701618650001401635650002301649650002301672650002801695650002001723650001501743650001801758650002701776650001201803650001501815650001901830650002001849650002201869650001601891650002301907653002301930653002001953700001801973700001801991773007202009852000902081930003302090945001302123946001302136655001202149IND2044402120221119170852.0950202e199408  mnu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204440212DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWhilhite, S.E.10aMutational analysis of gliotoxin production by the biocontrol fungus Gliocladium virens in relation to suppression of Pythium damping-off  ap. 816-821.  a2019-12-05  aThe fungus Gliocladium virens is an important biocontrol agent against plant pathogenic fungi, such as Pythium ultimum and Rhizoctonia solani. that cause damping-off diseases. G. virens strain G20 (synonym GL21) has been commercially formulated into the disease-suppressing product Gliogard (W. R. Grace & Co., CT). One possible mechanism of G. virens biocontrol may be the production of the fungistatic metabolite gliotoxin. The presence of this metabolite has been associated previously with disease suppressive activity toward P. ultimum. The purpose of this study was to critically test, using mutational analysis, the importance of gliotoxin production in the disease-suppressiveness effected against P. ultimum. Seven mutants lacking gliotoxin production (Glx- phenotype) were isolated by selection-based enrichment and screening procedures following UV-treatment of parental strain G20-4VIB (WT). On average, these Glx-mutants displayed only 54% of the disease-suppressive activity of the wild-type isolate in vivo and experienced a nearly total loss of antagonistic activity in vitro toward P. ultimum. This study represents strong genetic evidence supporting a major role for antibiosis in the suppression of a plant disease by a fungal biocontrol agent. 3aantibiosis 3aplant diseases and disorders 3abiosynthesis 3aphenotype 3aTrichoderma virens 3astrain differences 3aThanatephorus cucumeris 3adisease control 3amycotoxins 3apathogenicity 3aplant pathogenic fungi 3amutants 3apathotypes 3abedding plants 3aPythium ultimum 3aculture filtrates 3ametabolites 3abiological control 0agenetic regulation 0aHypocrea virens1 aLumsden, R.D.1 aStraney, D.C.0 tPhytopathology.g1994 Aug., v. 84, no. 8 p.816-821x0031-949X7nnas  aDNAL  a20060204b00000000c00000000  aINDdMKS  aOther US 7aarticle03551naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002800110040001800138100002000156245010400176300001800280520187900298650001102177650000902188650000902197650001702206650002002223650001602243650002302259650001302282650002002295650001602315650002002331650002302351650002202374650002802396650002502424650001602449650001202465650004802477650001402525650001102539650002202550650003202572650001102604650001402615650000902629650001002638650001602648653002002664700001402684700001802698773007502716852000902791856007802800930003302878945001302911946001302924655001202937IND2047233920221119171044.0950810e199507  ilu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204723392DNAL7 a74794932pmid7 a10.3382/ps.07411682doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFernandez, S.R.10aDietary formulation with cottonseed meal on a total amino acid versus a digestible amino acid basis  ap. 1168-1179.  aThe results of previous experiments indicated that performance of chicks fed corn-cottonseed meal (CSM) diets was inferior to performance of chicks fed a corn-soybean meal (SBM) diet and that true digestibilities of amino acids (AA) in CSM were lower than those in SBM. Therefore, the current study evaluated the formulation of diets containing expander-solvent CSM on an equivalent total AA basis vs an equivalent digestible AA basis compared to a corn-SBM diet. True digestibility of AA in the CSM, com, and SBM were determined using the precision-feeding assay with cecectomized roosters and TMEn was determined using conventional roosters. One-week-old male chicks were then fed diets containing corn and SBM only or diets containing increasing levels of CSM from 5 to 40% that were formulated to be equal in total or digestible AA to the corn-SBM diet. All diets contained 20.7% CP and 3,200 kcal TMEn/kg. Weight gain and feed efficiency of chicks fed 20% or more CSM on a total AA basis were less (P < .05) than those of chicks fed the corn-SBM diet. Growth performance of chicks fed up to 20% CSM on a digestible basis was equivalent to that of chicks fed the corn-SBM diet, but dietary levels of 30 or 40% CSM depressed performance even on a digestible basis. Increasing most essential AA by 15% in the 40% CSM (digestible basis) diet had no effect on performance. True digestible AA and ME values determined in chicks were similar to those determined in roosters. These results indicate that formulation of diets containing CSM on a digestible AA basis is superior to formulation on a total AA basis and that at least 20% CSM could be fed to chicks if the diet contains adequate levels of digestible AA and Fe to bind gossypol. The results also indicated that the depression in performance from feeding 30 or 40% CSM diets was not associated with dietary AA levels. 3achicks 3adiet 3acorn 3asoybean meal 3acottonseed meal 3aamino acids 3adigestible protein 3aroosters 3aliveweight gain 3afeed intake 3afeed conversion 3aad libitum feeding 2aAgingxmetabolism 2aAmino Acidsxmetabolism 2aAnalysis of Variance 2aAnimal Feed 2aAnimals 2aChickensxgrowth & developmentxphysiology. 2aDigestion 2aEating 2aEnergy Metabolism 2aEvaluation Studies as Topic 2aFemale 2aGossypium 2aMale 2aSeeds 2aWeight Gain 0aage differences1 aZhang, Y.1 aParsons, C.M.0 tPoultry science.g1995 July, v. 74, no. 7 p.1168-1179x0032-57917nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3382/ps.07411683Available from publisher's Web site  a19950905b19950912c00000000  aINDdJIT  aOther US 7aarticle02738naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003200092040001800124100002200142245009900164300001800263520126200281650002501543650003701568650001401605650001501619650002001634650001101654650001001665650002201675700002501697700001901722700002201741700002401763700001501787700001901802700001901821700001901840700002101859700002201880700001601902700002101918700002001939700002201959700002201981773009402003852000902097856008202106930003302188946001102221655001202232IND4413794520221119171147.0081212e200812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441379452DNAL7 a10.1002/elps.2008003012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKumagai, Hidesato10aLarge-scale microfabricated channel plates for high-throughput, fully automated DNA sequencing  ap. 4723-4732.  aWe have described a new DNA sequencing platform based on the Sanger chemistry, in which the large-scale microfabricated channel plates and electrophoretic system result in higher-throughput DNA sequencing. Three hundred and eighty-four channels are arranged in a fan-like shape on a 25x47 cm glass plate, on which 384 oval sample holes are connected to each channel coupled to the opposite anode access holes. Two microfabricated plates are set on the sequencing apparatus, in which sequencing electrophoresis is conducted on one plate and the preparation process is on another plate. Each sample hole is loaded with 2.3 μL volume of sample and injected into separation channels electrokinetically. High-quality sequencing data were acquired using the pUC18 template, achieving an average read-length of 1001 bases with 99% accuracy and a throughput of 5 Mbases per day per instrument. To assess the performance in actual sequencing field, the bacterial artificial chromosome shotgun library of the Pseudorca crassidens genome was sequenced, using 1/80 of the quantity of Sanger reagent (0.1 μL). We believe that this is the first demonstration of the useful performance of DNA sequencing using monolithic microfabricated devices with walk-away operation. 3aPseudorca crassidens 3abacterial artificial chromosomes 3achemistry 3aelectrodes 3aelectrophoresis 3agenome 3aglass 3asequence analysis1 aUtsunomiya, Shinichi1 aNakamura, Shin1 aYamamoto, Rintaro1 aHarada, A.q(Akira)1 aKaji, Toru1 aHazama, Makoto1 aOhashi, Tetsuo1 aInami, Atsushi1 aIkegami, Takashi1 aMiyamoto, Keisuke1 aEndo, Naoya1 aYoshimi, Kenichi1 aToyoda, Atsushi1 aHattori, Masahira1 aSakaki, Yoshiyuki0 tElectrophoresis.g2008 Dec., v. 29, no. 23 p.4723-4732dWiley-VCH Verlagx0173-08357nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/elps.2008003013Available from publisher's Web site  a20081212b20090206c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02437naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003200092040001800124100002300142245011900165300001800284520119600302650001201498650001001510650002001520650001501540650001001555650006601565650001201631650001401643650003001657650002101687651001201708700002101720700002101741700001701762700001901779773009401798852000901892856008201901930003301983946001102016655001202027IND4413795220221119170838.0081212e200812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441379522DNAL7 a10.1002/elps.2008001072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMengel-From, Jonas10aDetermination of cis/trans phase of variations in the MC1R gene with allele-specific PCR and single base extension  ap. 4780-4787.  aThe MC1R gene encodes a protein with key regulatory functions in the melanin synthesis. A multiplex PCR and a multiplex single base extension protocol were established for genotyping six exonic MC1R variations highly penetrant for red hair (R), four exonic MC1R variations weakly penetrant for red hair (r), two frameshift variations highly penetrant for red hair (R) and three variations in the promoter region. We genotyped 600 individuals from Denmark using either CE or MALDI-TOF MS as the detection platform. A total of 62 individuals were genotyped R/R and among the 62 individuals, 57 had red hair and five had blond hair colour. Two different R alleles may be located in cis (RR/-) position or trans (R/R) position, and the phenotype associated with RR/- and R/R may be different. Two allele-specific PCRs were established with primers targeting the -G445A variation in the MC1R promoter and the allele-specific PCR products were used in the multiplex single base extension assay. In all 62 individuals, the MC1R variants were situated in trans position. Another 18 individuals with red hair colour were either genotyped R/- or R/r, suggesting that other genes influence hair colour. 3aalleles 3acolor 3aelectrophoresis 3agenotyping 3ahairs 3amatrix-assisted laser desorption-ionization mass spectrometry 3amelanin 3aphenotype 3apolymerase chain reaction 3apromoter regions 3aDenmark1 aBørsting, Claus1 aSanchez, Juan J.1 aEiberg, Hans1 aMorling, Niels0 tElectrophoresis.g2008 Dec., v. 29, no. 23 p.4780-4787dWiley-VCH Verlagx0173-08357nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/elps.2008001073Available from publisher's Web site  a20081212b20090206c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03606naa a2200733 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111072001700129072001700146072001700163100003000180245014600210300001800356520126200374650001001636650001401646650001601660650001601676650000901692650001501701650001901716650002801735650002301763650002401786650003001810650001801840650001701858650005501875650003101930650002901961650002901990650004502019650003302064650002202097650003902119650004102158650003202199650002302231651001102254700003202265700002402297700003102321700002802352700002802380700003802408700002302446700001902469700002902488700003202517700001902549700003202568700004102600700002402641700002802665773008702693852000902780930003302789945002502822946001302847655001202860IND4413803620221119170901.0081215e200812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441380362DNAL7 a192448962pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

In stage 1, fish matrix samples (n = 258) were spiked at several levels with Salmonella and a combination of Salmonella and non-Salmonella competitive organisms. Replicates were analyzed by the BAX system PCR method and the reference method with comparable results (sensitivity >or=97.5%, specificity >or=83.3%) from both methods at the limit of detection. In stage 2, a total of 1,988 samples with 70 product types were analyzed with both methods. Five laboratories were involved in this study, and the samples used were from routine analyses. The BAX system PCR method was shown to be comparable to the reference method, with a limit of detection of 1.0 to 2.0 CFU/25 g of sample. Analysis of the results obtained in stage 2 and in the combination of stages 1 and 2 for the BAX system showed the following performance: sensitivity >or=99.0%, specificity >or=97.2%, false-negative rate <or=1.1%, and false-positive rate <or= 2.8%. Therefore, the BAX system appears to be equivalent to the reference method, with >or=97.3% agreement. 3afoods 3atap water 3aenvironment 3afood matrix 3afish 3aSalmonella 3afood pathogens 3abacterial contamination 3afood contamination 3amicrobial detection 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aculture media 2aAutoanalysis 2aColony Count, Microbialxinstrumentationxmethods. 2aEnvironmental Microbiology 2aFalse Negative Reactions 2aFalse Positive Reactions 2aFood Analysisxinstrumentationxmethods. 2aFood Contaminationxanalysis 2aFood Microbiology 2aPolymerase Chain Reactionxmethods 2aSalmonellaxisolation & purification 2aSensitivity and Specificity 2aWater Microbiology 3aBrazil1 aFreitas, Josinete Barros de1 aFabbi, Leania Maria1 aFilipini, Terezinha Agnese1 aSilva, Claudia Maria da1 aBedin, Janaina Mussnich1 aDuarte, Dalila Angelica Moliterno1 aSantos, Amaury dos1 aBaccarin, Aldo1 aHiga, Ligia Rossi Garcia1 aYano, Dirce Mithico Yamaoka1 aKillner, Mario1 aFrezza, Andrea Leao Cameiro1 aAbecia,  Eduardo Carlos de Gosztonyi1 aTronco, Vania Maria1 aTomazelli Junior, Osmar0 tJournal of food protection.g2008 Dec., v. 71, no. 12 p.2442-2447x0362-028X7nnas  aDNAL  a20090113b20090206c00000000  aINDdPNNe2009/01/13  aOther US 7aarticle02871naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072002000110072002000130072002000150100002500170245008500195300001800280520168300298650001701981650002101998650001802019650001302037650001702050650002402067650002302091650001702114650002802131650002402159650001502183650002102198650002102219650001902240650002802259650001602287700002502303773008702328852000902415946001302424655001202437IND4413803420221119170935.0081215s2008    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441380342DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

   1 aDominquez, Silvia A.10aModeling the Growth of Salmonella in Raw Poultry Stored under Aerobic Conditions  ap. 2429-2435.  aThe presence of Salmonella in raw poultry is a well-recognized risk factor for foodborne illness. The objective of this study was to develop and validate a mathematical model that predicts the growth of Salmonella in raw poultry stored under aerobic conditions at a variety of temperatures. One hundred twelve Salmonella growth rates were extracted from 12 previously published studies. These growth rates were used to develop a square-root model relating the growth rate of Salmonella to storage temperature. Model predictions were compared to growth rate measurements collected in our laboratory for four poultry-specific Salmonella strains (two antibiotic-resistant and two nonresistant strains) inoculated onto raw chicken tenderloins. Chicken was inoculated at two levels (10(3) CFU/cm2 and <or=10 CFU/cm2) and incubated at temperatures ranging from 10 to 37°C. Visual inspection of the data, bias and accuracy factors, and comparison with two other published models were used to analyze the performance of the new model. Neither antibiotic resistance nor inoculum size affected Salmonella growth rates. The presence of spoilage microflora did not appear to slow the growth of Salmonella. Our model provided intermediate predicted growth rates when compared with the two other published models. Our model predicted slightly faster growth rates than those observed in inoculated chicken in the temperature range of 10 to 28°C but slightly slower growth rates than those observed between 30 and 37°C. Slightly negative bias factors were obtained in every case (-5 to -3%); however, application of the model may be considered fail-safe for storage temperatures below 28°C. 3achicken meat 3aloins (meat cut) 3abreast muscle 3araw meat 3afood storage 3astorage temperature 3aaerobic conditions 3acold storage 3apredictive microbiology 3amathematical models 3aSalmonella 3amicrobial growth 3amodel validation 3afood pathogens 3abacterial contamination 3afood safety1 aSchaffner, Donald W.0 tJournal of food protection.g2008 Dec., v. 71, no. 12 p.2429-2435x0362-028X7nnas  aDNAL  aOther US 7aarticle03173naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001500152245011600167300001500283520158800298650002701886650001201913650001401925650002101939650001501960650001201975650002501987650001502012650002402027650001502051650001202066650002602078650002602104650001402130650001002144651001102154653001002165653002902175653001502204653003502219653002202254700001702276700002002293700001902313700001502332700001802347700001602365773010902381852000902490856007602499930003302575946001102608655001202619IND4389691520221119170850.0070325e200704  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438969152DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-3180.2007.00544.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDÉLYE, C.10aStatus of black grass (Alopecurus myosuroides) resistance to acetyl-coenzyme A carboxylase inhibitors in France  ap. 95-105.  aWe assessed the contributions of target site- and non-target site-based resistance to herbicides inhibiting acetyl-coenzyme A carboxylase (ACC) in Alopecurus myosuroides (black grass). A total of 243 A. myosuroides populations collected across France were analysed using herbicide sensitivity bioassay (24 300 seedlings analysed) and ACC genotyping (13 188 seedlings analysed). Seedlings resistant to at least one ACC-inhibiting herbicide were detected in 99.2% of the populations. Mutant, resistant ACC allele(s) were detected in 56.8% of the populations. Among the five resistant ACC alleles known in A. myosuroides, alleles containing an isoleucine-to-leucine substitution at codon 1781 were predominant (59.5% of the plants containing resistant ACC alleles). Comparison of the results from herbicide sensitivity bioassays with genotyping indicated that more than 75% of the plants resistant to ACC-inhibiting herbicides in France would be resistant via increased herbicide metabolism. Analysis of herbicide application records suggested that in 15.9% of the populations studied, metabolism-based resistance to ACC-inhibiting herbicides was mostly selected for by herbicides with other modes of action. Our study revealed the importance of non-target site-based resistance in A. myosuroides. Using herbicides with alternative modes of action to control populations resistant to ACC-inhibiting herbicides, the recommended management approach, may thus be jeopardised by the widespread occurrence of metabolism-based resistance mechanisms conferring broad-spectrum cross-resistance. 3aAlopecurus myosuroides 3aalleles 3abioassays 3across resistance 3agenotyping 3agrasses 3aherbicide resistance 3aherbicides 3amechanism of action 3ametabolism 3amutants 3apesticide application 3aresistance mechanisms 3aseedlings 3aweeds 3aFrance 0aalomy 0acultural practice survey 0agenotyping 0aherbicide resistance mechanism 0alarge-scale study1 aMENCHARI, Y.1 aGUILLEMIN, J-P.1 aMATÉJICEK, A.1 aMICHEL, S.1 aCAMILLERI, C.1 aCHAUVEL, B.0 tWeed research.g2007 Apr., v. 47, no. 2 p.95-105dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0043-17377nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-3180.2007.00544.x3electronic resource  a20070325b20070402c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03048naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001600152245010000168300001400268520177000282650001102052650002002063650001602083650002002099650001602119650002302135650001402158650001802172650001002190650001702200650001002217653001102227653001802238653001902256700001602275700001602291700001602307700001302323700001702336773010802353852000902461856007602470930003302546946001102579655001202590IND4387072620221119170853.0070122e200702  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438707262DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-3180.2007.00549.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDINELLI, G.10aRoot exudation of diclofop-methyl and triasulfuron from foliar-treated durum wheat and ryegrass  ap. 25-33.  aIn this study, we evaluated the release of diclofop-methyl and triasulfuron from the roots of foliar-treated ryegrass and wheat. The study with ¹⁴C-diclofop-methyl indicated a basipetal translocation of foliar-applied herbicide in wheat and ryegrass. No root exudation from ¹⁴C-diclofop-methyl-treated wheat plants was observed, while 20 days after treatment (DAT) 0.2-0.9% of radioactivity absorbed by ryegrass was found exuded in the growing medium. Root exudation was stimulated three to six times by the presence of untreated wheat or ryegrass sharing the growing medium with diclofop-methyl-treated ryegrass. No subsequent uptake of exuded radiolabel by untreated plants (ryegrass or wheat) in the same pot with ¹⁴C-diclofop-methyl-treated ryegrass was observed. The study with ¹⁴C-triasulfuron indicated a basipetal translocation of foliar-applied herbicide in wheat and ryegrass and also into the growing medium. By 20 DAT, 0.5-4.2% of radioactivity absorbed by wheat or ryegrass was found exuded in the growing medium. The presence of untreated plants (wheat or ryegrass) in the same pot as triasulfuron-treated ryegrass or wheat induced exudation seven to 32 times more. The study also revealed a subsequent uptake of exuded compounds by untreated wheat or ryegrass sharing the medium of ¹⁴C-triasulfuron-treated plants. This study has demonstrated for the first time that the root exudation of exogenous compounds can be related to plant arrangement in pots. The implication is that herbicide root exudation and transfer, a form of allelopathy, could be significant in the field. A precise estimation of environmental fate, unexpected ecological side effects and residual activity of herbicides may require quantification of such exudation. 3aLolium 3aadverse effects 3aallelopathy 3adiclofop-methyl 3adurum wheat 3aenvironmental fate 3aexudation 3agrowing media 3aroots 3atriasulfuron 3aweeds 0auptake 0atranslocation 0aroot exudation1 aBonetti, A.1 aMAROTTI, I.1 aMINELLI, M.1 aBUSI, S.1 aCATIZONE, P.0 tWeed research.g2007 Feb., v. 47, no. 1 p.25-33dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0043-17377nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-3180.2007.00549.x3electronic resource  a20070122b20070202c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02413naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003100092040001800123100002000141245005600161300001800217500002400235520132600259650001201585650002301597650001401620650001101634650001401645650001101659650001201670650000901682650001101691650001801702650001701720650001001737700001901747700001901766700001801785700002101803773008901824852000901913856008101922655001202003IND4464001620221119170812.0120904s2003    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446400162DNAL7 a10.1081/PLN-1200200752doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGong, Hai‐jun10aEffects of Silicon on Growth of Wheat Under Drought  ap. 1055-1063.  aIncludes references  aPlants of wheat growing in pots with silicon (Si) applied before sowing had greater plant height, leaf area, and dry materials compared to those without Si applied in well watering conditions. Drought stress was applied by withholding watering for 12 days from 26‐day old seedlings. In the stress conditions, plants growing in Si‐applied soil could maintain higher relative water content (RWC), water potential and leaf area compared to those without Si applied. Moreover, the Si applied plant dry materials were not significantly changed by drought while those of plants growing in pots without Si applied were significantly decreased, and this was mainly due to growth inhibition of the shoots. Drought stressed wheat growing in pots with Si applied had a significantly greater leaf weight ratio (LWR) and lower specific leaf area (SLA) compared to those of stressed plants in the absence of applied Si. This demonstrates that the leaves of stressed plants growing in pots with Si applied were thicker compared to those without Si applied. This may have a beneficial effect by reducing the transpirational loss of water and maintain high RWC and water potential. Therefore, application of Si may be one of the available pathways to improve growth of this crop and increase its production in arid or semi arid areas. 3adrought 3agrowth retardation 3aleaf area 3aleaves 3aseedlings 3ashoots 3asilicon 3asoil 3asowing 3awater content 3awater stress 3awheat1 aChen, Kun-ming1 aChen, Guo-cang1 aWang, Suo-min1 aZhang, Cheng-lie0 tJournal of plant nutrition.g2003, v. 26, no. 5 p.1055-1063dDekkerx0190-41677nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1081/PLN-1200200753Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02344naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003100092040001800123100002100141245009300162300001800255500002400273520102200297650004301319650001201362650001401374650002501388650001801413650001601431650001101447650001301458650001601471650001101487650001401498650002101512650001401533650001501547650001401562650001301576650001101589650001101600650001301611700001901624700002001643700002001663773008901683852000901772856008101781655001201862IND4464001520221119170733.0120904s2003    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446400152DNAL7 a10.1081/PLN-1200200742doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMoreno, Diego A.10aRelationship of Leaf Macronutrient Concentrations in New Tomato Varieties to Fruit Yield  ap. 1035-1054.  aIncludes references  aThis study was performed to evaluate the response of different newly established tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill.) cultivars (Búfalo [control, a widely cultivated variety], Corindon, Dombelo, GC‐773, GC‐775, Nancy, Noa, Sarky, Yunque, Volcani, 617/83, and 2084/81), all cultivated under identical greenhouse conditions, in relation to the efficiency in macronutrient utilization to ascertain whether the genotype and the plant developmental stages affect the concentrations of nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), potassium (K), sodium (Na), calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg), and sulfur (S) in leaves. The cultivar with greater foliar‐biomass production (Volcani) or greater concentration of nutrients as organic N (Noa, Yunque, 617/83) showed less marketable and more non‐commercial fruit production.

We detected nine compounds that were present in at least 75% of the individuals in at least one type of bee, and which were not present in the sampling environment alone. Four of these compounds were present in queens but not in workers. One of these four compounds, identified as E-β-ocimene, was expressed fully only in established mated queens and may be a signal of diploid egg-laying activity. The three remaining queen-specific compounds (including one identified as 2-phenylethanol) were associated with unmated queens and may mediate interactions between unmated queens and workers during queen elimination. The five common compounds that we detected in both queens and workers were hydrocarbons and may function as nestmate recognition cues. We consider these discoveries as a first step in determining the potentially important functions of volatile signals and cues within honey bee nests. 3aApis mellifera 3aqueen honey bees 3avolatile compounds 3aocimene 3avirgin females 3amating behavior 3asemiochemicals 3amicroextraction 2aAlkenesxanalysis 2aAnimals 2aBeesxchemistry 2aFemale 2aHydrocarbonsxanalysis 2aPhenylethyl Alcoholxanalysis 2aSexual Behavior, Animal 2aVolatilization 0aqueen volatiles 0a2-phenylethanol 0amating status 0asolid phase microextraction1 aDeGrandi-Hoffman, G.1 aHooper, J.E.0 tJournal of insect physiology.g2006 May, v. 52, no. 5 p.520-527dPergamonx0022-19107nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jinsphys.2006.01.0143electronic resource  a20060621b20060702c00000000  aINDdNZMe2006/06/20  aNon-US 7aarticle03455naa a2200625 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004100092040001800133100001700151245008900168300001600257500016800273500002400441520162700465650001302092650001202105650001302117650001202130650001102142650001002153650001402163650001002177650001902187650001502206650001602221650001302237650001302250650001402263650001602277650001002293650001302303650001002316650001102326650001102337650001402348650002702362650001102389650001402400650002302414650001602437650001302453650001002466650001502476650001702491650002102508650001202529650001902541651001802560773013902578852000902717856009102726655001202817IND4463993720221119170809.0120829s2012    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446399372DNAL7 a10.17660/ActaHortic.2012.948.302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGreene, S.L.10aFruit and nut crop wild relatives in the United States: a surprisingly rich resource  ap. 263-269.  aPaper presented at the First International Symposium on Wild Relatives of Subtropical and Temperate Fruit and Nut Crops, held March 19-23, 2011, Davis, California.  aIncludes references  aWhen early settlers arrived in the United States they were struck by the many fruits and nuts they recognized, including grapes (Vitis), plums and cherries (Prunus), strawberries (Fragaria), currants (Ribes), blueberries and cranberries (Vaccinium), wild chestnuts (Castanea), filberts (Corylus), and walnuts (Juglans). Native fruit and nut crop wild relatives were an important genetic resource in establishing early commercial production. Today we tend to forget the many native and naturalized plants in the United States that are important crop wild relatives (CWR). Developing a national strategy would be prudent with a national inventory being a logical starting point. We discuss the development of a U.S. CWR inventory that covered crops used for food, fiber, forage, medicine, esthetics, restoration and timber. The preliminary inventory contained over 2600 entries. A total of 364 CWR taxa were useful for breeding 65 different crops. Fifty five percent of these CWR taxa were potential resources for fruit and nut improvement. Many of these fruit and nut CWR have been used extensively by breeders and have contributed important traits such as disease and insect resistance and abiotic stress tolerance. Native species of Vitis, Juglans, and Prunus are important rootstocks. Although germplasm collections exist, we need to revisit our efforts to conserve the native and naturalized germplasm in our own back yard. A comprehensive national CWR inventory will help us focus on setting priorities and developing a national strategy to conserve these important genetic resources to ensure their use in the future. 3aCastanea 3aCorylus 3aFragaria 3aJuglans 3aPrunus 3aRibes 3aVaccinium 3aVitis 3aabiotic stress 3aaesthetics 3ablueberries 3abreeding 3acherries 3achestnuts 3acranberries 3acrops 3acurrants 3afoods 3aforage 3afruits 3agermplasm 3agermplasm conservation 3agrapes 3ahazelnuts 3aindigenous species 3ainventories 3amedicine 3aplums 3arootstocks 3astrawberries 3astress tolerance 3awalnuts 3awild relatives 3aUnited States0 tActa horticulturae.g2012 May, , no. 948 p.263-269dInternational Society for Horticultural SciencewJournal:jnl46289x0567-75727nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.17660/ActaHortic.2012.948.303Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle01917naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002700110245012400137300001600261520092100277650002001198650002901218650002501247650001801272650002301290650001401313650001401327650001301341653001301354653001701367700001501384700001601399773007201415852000901487930003301496945001301529946001301542655001201555IND2044363420221119171152.0950131e199406  mnu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204436342DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRodriguez-Alvarado, G.10aSymptom modification by satellite tobacco mosaic virus in pepper types and cultivars infected with helper tobamoviruses  ap. 617-621.  aThe presence of satellite tobacco mosaic virus (STMV) in coinfection with eight helper viruses in 23 hosts has previously been reported to cause no change in the symptoms induced by the helper viruses alone. This is not the case for systemic infection of certain types and cultivars of pepper, Capsicum annuum. In Jalapeno and Pimiento pepper plants, the presence of STMV in coinfections with TMV-U2 caused increased chlorosis in the form of abundant, bright-yellow patches relative to the mosaic caused by TMV-U2 alone. Increased chlorosis also was observed when TMV-U5 and pepper mild mottle virus (PMMV) were used as helper viruses. In Jalapeno the presence of STMV ameliorated severe blistering (leaf distortion) caused transiently by TMV-U2 at approximately 6 wk after inoculation. The concentration of TMV-U2 in Jalapeno plants was reduced by 87% in coinfection with STMV compared to infection by TMV-U2 alone. 3aCapsicum annuum 3aPepper mild mottle virus 3aTobacco mosaic virus 3apathogenicity 3adisease resistance 3acultivars 3achlorosis 3ainoculum 0asymptoms 0acoinfections1 aKurath, G.1 aDodds, J.A.0 tPhytopathology.g1994 June, v. 84, no. 6 p.617-621x0031-949X7nnas  aDNAL  a19950303b19950309c00000000  aINDdMKS  aOther US 7aarticle03663naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134072000900152100001400161245017600175300001600351500002400367500001500391520232500406650002302731650001502754650002602769650001402795650002702809650001202836650001902848650002702867650001302894653001902907653003002926653001002956700001502966773009202981852000903073856007603082930003303158945002503191946001303216655001203229IND4380490720221119170941.0060526e200606  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438049072DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biocontrol.2006.01.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF8311 aCox, K.D.10aInteraction dynamics between saprobic lignicolous fungi and Armillaria in controlled environments: Exploring the potential for competitive exclusion of Armillaria on peach  ap. 291-300.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aArmillaria root rot, caused by Armillaria tabescens and Armillaria mellea, is a major cause of premature tree death in peach orchards in the southeastern United States. The root systems of infected trees can become entirely colonized by Armillaria, serving as an inoculum source for adjacent trees and providing massive inoculum levels in replant situations. If dead or dying trees could be colonized by an effective competitor of Armillaria before their removal, the extent of root colonization by the pathogen could be reduced, thus decreasing the threat to adjacent trees and/or subsequent plantings. Interactions between five species of saprobic lignicolous fungi (Ganoderma lucidum, Hypholoma fasciculare, Phanerochaete velutina, Schizophyllum commune, and Xylaria hypoxylon) and the two Armillaria species were examined in controlled conditions to provide proof of concept for competitive exclusion of Armillaria from peach roots. On agar-coated glass slides, all five potential antagonists induced detrimental reactions in >58% of the Armillaria hyphae observed, with the majority resulting in hyphal swelling or granulation. On poplar wood blocks, all antagonists consistently either overgrew Armillaria colonies or--in the case of S. commune--engaged in deadlock reactions; in all cases, the viability of Armillaria colonies was reduced to <30% of that of unchallenged controls. When inoculated simultaneously onto opposite ends of peach root segments, all antagonists consistently reduced growth and viability of Armillaria on and under the bark, whereby reduction of pathogen growth underneath the bark, Armillaria's primary ecological niche, was most pronounced for G. lucidum, S. commune, and X. hypoxylon. When root segments were allowed to be colonized entirely by Armillaria before being inoculated with the antagonists, the latter were able to overgrow the pathogen on the root surface but unable to pre-empt it from underneath the bark. In summary,G. lucidum, S. commune, and X. hypoxylon caused strong hyphal and mycelial interference reactions and the most pronounced reductions in growth of Armillaria above and below the bark, indicating that they would be the most promising candidates for field-scale evaluations to restrict colonization of dead or dying peach trees by Armillaria in the orchard. 3afungal antagonists 3aArmillaria 3acompetitive exclusion 3aviability 3agrowth and development 3apeaches 3aPrunus persica 3aplant pathogenic fungi 3aroot rot 0asaprobic fungi 0abiological control agents 0afungi1 aScherm, H.0 tBiological control.g2006 June, v. 37, no. 3 p.291-300dAcademic Pressx1049-96447nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biocontrol.2006.01.0123electronic resource  a20060615b20060702c00000000  aINDdNZMe2006/06/13  aOther US 7aarticle03967naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002800110040001800138100001600156245008900172300001600261500001500277520234300292650002102635650002202656650001502678650001802693650001602711650002302727650001602750650002002766650002102786650000902807650001702816650001602833650001602849650001202865650001602877650003802893650004602931650001102977650002002988650001103008650001603019650004403035650001003079650001303089653001803102653002303120700001503143773007303158852000903231856007803240930003303318945001303351946001303364655001203377IND2046618120221119170948.0950628e199504  ilu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204661812DNAL7 a77922392pmid7 a10.3382/ps.07406722doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMamputu, M.10aEffect of substituting sesame meal for soybean meal on layer and broiler performance  ap. 672-684.  a2019-12-04  aSesame meal (SM, 47.1% CP) has an amino acid composition similar to that of soybean meal (SBM, 47.7% CP) with the exception of lower lysine and higher methionine, but has been relatively underutilized in poultry feeds. Two experiments (1 and 2) were conducted to measure laying performance and hatchability of White Leghorn hens fed practical diets (17% CP), and two additional experiments (3 and 4) examined the performance of broiler chicks fed practical diets (22% CP) with varying substitution levels of screwpressed SM for solvent-extracted SBM. In Experiment 1, SM contributed 0,12.6, 25.3, 38, or 50.6% of dietary CP, and each diet was fed to hens for 6 wk. In Experiment 2, SM contributed 0, 4.7, 9.4, 14.1, 18.8 or 23.6% of dietary CP, and each diet was fed for 4 wk. In Experiment 3, SM contributed 0, 15, 30, 45, or 60% of dietary CP, and in Experiment 4, SM contributed 0, 38, or 76% of dietary CP; in these experiments, diets were fed to broiler chicks for 3 wk. There were no differences in egg production, egg weight, egg mass, daily feed intake, or body weight measurements among control hens fed SBM and hens fed SM at 12.6% (Experiment 1) or 4.7 to 18.8% of dietary CP (Experiment 2). Hens consuming these diets were able to satisfy their daily requirements for essential amino acids. Egg quality measurements were similar among hens fed the control SBM diet and those fed SM at 12.6 or 25.3% of dietary CP in Experiment 1, and at 4.7 to 23.6% of dietary CP in Experiment 2. All production variables were significantly depressed in hens that were fed SM at 38 or 50.6% of dietary CP, but Haugh units increased. In Experiment 3, the performance of broiler chicks fed the diet containing SM at 15% of dietary CP was not different from that of the control chicks fed the SBM diet, and both diets contained essential amino acids at required levels. Feed intake, body weight gain, and feed conversion were consistently depressed with increased SM substitution at 30, 45, or 60% of dietary CP. In Experiment 4, feed intake was not different between the control chicks fed the SBM diet and those fed the diet containing SM at 38% of dietary CP. However, body weight gain and feed conversion of chicks fed diets containing SM at 38 or 76% of dietary CP were significantly lower than those of the control chicks fed the SBM diet. 3abroiler chickens 3aegg shell quality 3aegg weight 3acrude protein 3aamino acids 3alaying performance 3afeed intake 3aliveweight gain 3aegg hatchability 3ahens 3asoybean meal 3asesame meal 2aAnimal Feed 2aAnimals 2aBody Weight 2aChickensxmetabolismxphysiology. 2aDietary Proteinsxadministration & dosage 2aEating 2aEggsxstandards 2aFemale 2aOviposition 2aPlant Proteinsxadministration & dosage 2aSeeds 2aSoybeans 0aegg fertility 0aanimal performance1 aBuhr, R.J.0 tPoultry science.g1995 Apr., v. 74, no. 4 p.672-684x0032-57917nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3382/ps.07406723Available from publisher's Web site  a19950802b19950807c00000000  aINDdJIT  aOther US 7aarticle02514naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002800110040001800138100001600156245007900172300001600251520136500267650000901632650001501641650002801656650002201684650001201706650001301718650002301731650001801754650002001772650004101792653002001833700001601853700001601869773007301885852000901958856007801967930003302045945001302078946001302091655001202104IND2046626720221119171007.0950628e199504  ilu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204662672DNAL7 a77922482pmid7 a10.3382/ps.07407532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJones, F.T.10aSalmonella contamination in commercial eggs and an egg production facility  ap. 753-757.  aEgg samples were collected from various stages of an egg processing operation and from the attached production facility.

Recovery of Salmonella from flush water, ventilation fan, egg belt, and egg collector samples were (positive samples/total samples collected): 2/2, 4/4, 16/22, and 14/22, respectively. Salmonella was found on 7 of the 90 eggshells sampled before processing and 1 of 90 eggshells sampled after processing, but Salmonella was not found in the 180 eggs analyzed for internal contamination following processing. The one eggshell found positive for Salmonella following processing was detected when the pH of wash water samples was lowest (10.19). The 60 isolates from production facilities included the following Salmonella serotypes: S. agona, S. typhimurium, S. infantis, S. derby, S. heidelberg, S. california, S. montevideo, S. mbandaka, and untypable. The 22 isolates obtained from eggshells prior to processing were serotyped as S. heidelberg and S. montevideo. All five isolates obtained from eggshells after processing were serotyped as S. heidelberg. These data suggest that although the shells of about 1% of commercial eggs are contaminated with Salmonella, contamination of the internal contents of eggs with Salmonella is a rare event. 3aeggs 3aSalmonella 3amicrobial contamination 3aegg shell quality 2aAnimals 2aChickens 2aEggsxmicrobiology 2aFood Handling 2aHousing, Animal 2aSalmonellaxisolation & purification 0achicken housing1 aRives, D.V.1 aCarey, J.B.0 tPoultry science.g1995 Apr., v. 74, no. 4 p.753-757x0032-57917nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3382/ps.07407533Available from publisher's Web site  a19950802b19950807c00000000  aINDdJIT  aOther US 7aarticle02647naa a2200565 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024001800097040001800115072001700133100002300150245008700173300001600260300003000276500004100306520106600347650001901413650001901432650001901451650001301470650001601483650001201499650001601511650001901527650003801546650001101584650001101595650001101606650001101617650004501628650002001673650000901693650003801702650001701740651001001757653001901767653002101786653002201807700002001829700001801849700002001867700001801887773010101905852000902006930003302015945000802048946001302056655001202069991565548670742620221119171037.0850801s1984    xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI850075632DNAL7 a64878722pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Recombinant human β-hexosaminidase A is a potentially therapeutic enzyme for GM2-gangliosidosis. Recombinant HexA has been produced by using the methylotrophic yeast Ogataea minuta as a host, and the purified enzyme was tested for its replacement effect on cultured fibroblasts derived from GM2-gangliosidosis patients. Although the therapeutic effect was observed, in order to obtain the higher therapeutic effect with a little dose as possible, increased phosphorylation of recombinant β-hexosaminidase A N-glycans is suggested to be prerequisite. In the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the overexpression of MNN4, which encodes a positive regulator of mannosylphosphate transferase, led to increased mannosylphosphate contents. In the present study, we cloned OmMNN4, a homologous gene to ScMNN4, based on the genomic sequence of O. minuta. We overexpressed the cloned gene under the control of the alcohol oxidase promoter in a β-hexosaminidase A-producing yeast strain. Structural analysis of pyridylamine-labeled N-glycans by high-performance liquid chromatography revealed that the overexpression of MNN4 caused a 3-fold increase in phosphorylated N-glycans of recombinant β-hexosaminidase A. The recombinant enzyme prepared from strains overexpressing OmMNN4 was more effectively incorporated into cultured fibroblasts and neural cells, and it more rapidly degraded the accumulated GM2-ganglioside as compared to the control enzyme. These results suggest that β-hexosaminidase A produced in a strain that overexpresses OmMNN4 will act as an effective enzyme for use in replacement therapy of GM2-gangliosidosis. 3aOgataea 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3aalcohol oxidase 3aenzyme replacement therapy 3afibroblasts 3agene overexpression 3agenes 3aglycosyltransferases 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3ahumans 3anucleotide sequences 3apatients 3aphosphorylation 3ayeasts1 aKasahara, Yoshiko1 aTsuji, Daisuke1 aItoh, Kohji1 aSakuraba, Hitoshi1 aChiba, Yasunori1 aJigami, Yoshifumi0 tGlycobiology.g2009 Sept., v. 19, no. 9 p.1002-1009x0959-66587nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/glycob/cwp0803Available from publisher's Web site  a20090808b00000000c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02342naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245009900127300001600226500001500242520137400257650001801631650002301649650003201672650002001704650001801724650001001742650002201752650001501774650002301789653001301812700001501825773007201840852000901912930003301921945001301954946001301967655001201980IND2044409120221119170805.0950202e199404  mnu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204440912DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKolmer, J.A.10aGene expression in the Triticum aestivum-Puccinia recondita f.sp. tritici gene-for-gene system  ap. 437-440.  a2019-12-05  aThe progeny of a selfed, single-uredinial isolate of Puccinia recondita f. sp. tritici segregated for virulence on near-isogenic Thatcher wheat lines with leaf rust resistance genes Lr2a, Lr2c, Lr3, Lr3ka, Lr11, Lr17, and Lr30. Progeny isolates that produced the lowest avirulent infection types on the homozygous Thatcher lines were assumed to be homozygous for avirulence alleles; isolates that produced intermediate infection types were assumed to be heterozygous; and isolates that produced high infection types were assumed to be homozygous for virulence alleles. The seven homozygous Thatcher lines were crossed with Thatcher to produce F1 plants. The F1 plants were selfed, and the F2 plants were inoculated with the three different progeny isolate genotypes, such that host lines and rust isolates were evaluated for infection type in all nine genotype combinations for each of the seven corresponding gene pairs in T. aestivum and P. r. tritici. The expression of the resistance genes ranged from complete dominance to complete recessiveness, whereas expression of the avirulence genes ranged from nearly complete dominance to complete recessiveness. The expression of resistance and avirulence genes in the wheat leaf rust gene-for-gene system was found to be highly dependent on the genotypes of the rust isolates and host lines involved in the interactions. 3arust diseases 3agenetic resistance 3ahost-parasite relationships 3agene expression 3apathogenicity 3agenes 3aTriticum aestivum 3apathotypes 3aPuccinia recondita 0agenotype1 aDyck, P.L.0 tPhytopathology.g1994 Apr., v. 84, no. 4 p.437-440x0031-949X7nnas  aDNAL  a19950303b19950309c00000000  aINDdMKS  aOther US 7aarticle02123naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100001400184245008100198300001600279506007600295520078100371506003701152650001501189650002101204650001801225650001301243650002601256700001701282700001601299700002001315700001801335700001701353700001901370700002101389700001701410773012401427852000901551856008301560930003301643946001301676655001201689IND4424320620221207083629.0090807e20090807xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442432062DNAL7 a10.1126/science.11763252doi7 aPMC28556232pmcid7 a196614312pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Ying10aC3PO, an Endoribonuclease That Promotes RNAi by Facilitating RISC Activation  ap. 750-753.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe catalytic engine of RNA interference (RNAi) is the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), wherein the endoribonuclease Argonaute and single-stranded small interfering RNA (siRNA) direct target mRNA cleavage. We reconstituted long double-stranded RNA- and duplex siRNA-initiated RISC activities with the use of recombinant Drosophila Dicer-2, R2D2, and Ago2 proteins. We used this core reconstitution system to purify an RNAi regulator that we term C3PO (component 3 promoter of RISC), a complex of Translin and Trax. C3PO is a Mg²⁺-dependent endoribonuclease that promotes RISC activation by removing siRNA passenger strand cleavage products. These studies establish an in vitro RNAi reconstitution system and identify C3PO as a key activator of the core RNAi machinery.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDrosophila 3aRNA interference 3amessenger RNA 3aproteins 3asmall interfering RNA1 aYe, Xuecheng1 aJiang, Feng1 aLiang, Chunyang1 aChen, Dongmei1 aPeng, Junmin1 aKinch, Lisa N.1 aGrishin, Nick V.1 aLiu, Qinghua0 tScience.g2009 Aug. 7, v. 325, no. 5941 p.750-753dAmerican Association for the Advancement of Sciencex0036-80757nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.11763253Available from publisher's Web site  a20090808b00000000c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03210naa a2200721 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127072001700144072001700161072001700178100002500195245005600220300001800276500001500294520123600309650003601545650002601581650001201607650000901619650001801628650002101646650002501667650002801692650001801720650001801738650001301756650002101769650001701790650002101807650002201828650002801850650003201878650002301910650002301933650002001956650001901976650002001995650002502015651002102040651001902061651001102080653002302091653002802114653002002142653002002162653001602182653002202198653001602220700002702236700001802263700002002281700001702301773008002318852000902398930003302407945002502440946001102465655001202476IND4413809420221119171115.0081215s2008    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441380942DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aLewis, Kathleen Anne10aIntegrated farming standards and food eco-labelling  ap. 1061-1078.  a2019-12-04  aPurpose -- The review aims to draw together the activities currently taking place globally but with particular reference to the UK regarding the application of integrated farming standards and food labelling and their contribution towards improving primary production standards and sustainable farming. Design/methodology/approach -- This was a desk study that focused on published literature, historical documentation, group debate and one-to-one interviews. Findings -- The majority of food standards are based upon codes of good practice with only tenuous links between the establishment of these standards and the required environmental outcomes. Whilst it is probable that such standards are producing environmental benefits there is little indisputable evidence to support this. Practical implications -- If we depend on assurance schemes to improve farming practices then a European-wide standard is required that is not compromised by variations in national laws and codes of practice. Originality/value -- This review will help inform and direct the ongoing UK debate on how to improve UK farming standards, minimising environmental impact, improving animal health and welfare, the rural economy and ensuring quality food. 3aintegrated agricultural systems 3aStaphylococcus aureus 3amussels 3arice 3afood labeling 3afood composition 3astandards and grades 3abacterial contamination 3afood analysis 3aglobalization 3aseafoods 3aagricultural law 3afood quality 3aEscherichia coli 3acoliform bacteria 3amicrobiological quality 3agood agricultural practices 3aready-to-eat foods 3afood contamination 3arural economics 3afood pathogens 3aBacillus cereus 3aenvironmental impact 3aTurkey (country) 3aUnited Kingdom 0aEurope 0aliterature reviews 0asustainable agriculture 0astuffed mussels 0afarming systems 0afood safety 0afood eco-labeling 0amidye dolma1 aTzilivakis, J.q(John)1 aGreen, Andrew1 aWarner, Douglas1 aColes, Adele0 tBritish food journal.g2008, v. 110, no. 10-11 p.1061-1078x0007-070X7nnas  aDNAL  a20090218b20090301c00000000  aINDd3CTe2009/01/15  aNon-US 7aarticle03477naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002400110245013800134300001600272500001500288520222200303650001402525650002602539650002502565650002302590650002202613650001802635650002702653650002302680650001702703650001102720650001502731651001302746651001502759653001402774653001302788653002502801700001802826700001902844700001602863773007202879852000902951930003302960945001302993946001303006655001203019IND2044409020221119170732.0950202e199404  mnu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204440902DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrandenberger, L.P.10aCharacterization of resistance of spinach to white rust (Albugo occidentalis) and downy mildew (Peronospora farinosa f.sp. spinaciae)  ap. 431-437.  a2019-12-05  aResistance of spinach to white rust (Albugo occidentalis) and races 3 and 4 of downy mildew (Peronospora farinosa f. sp. spinaciae) was quantified on several cultivars and breeding lines in separate field inoculation experiments. Several cultivars and breeding lines from the Arkansas breeding program had undergone repeated field selections for white rust resistance (Fall Green, Ozarka II, FA88-310, FA88-354, and FA86-70) while others had not (Grandstand, St. Helens, and Hybrid 424). Resistance to both diseases was quantified by measuring disease incidence and severity at regular intervals 7-32 days after inoculation. The latent periods and the area under the disease progress curve (AUDPC) also were compared. Overall, the cultivars and breeding lines that had undergone selection for white rust resistance had significantly higher levels of field resistance to both white rust and races 3 and 4 of downy mildew relative to the other cultivars tested. Two cultivars (Fall Green and Ozarka II) and three breeding lines (FA88-354 and FA88-310 or FA86-70) had significantly lower disease incidences and severity ratings to white rust and race 4 of downy mildew on most sampling dates than did St. Helens, Hybrid 424, and Grandstand. The AUDPC for Fall Green, Ozarka II, FA88-354, and FA88-310 or FA86-70 also was significantly lower than that of St. Helens, Hybrid 424, and Grandstand for white rust and race 4 of downy mildew. Fall Green, Ozarka 11, and FA88-354 had significantly lower disease incidences and severity ratings than did Grandstand in the race 3 downy mildew tests. The AUDPC for Fall Green, Ozarka II, and FA88-354 also was significantly lower than that of Grandstand in the race 3 downy mildew tests. The estimated latent periods were generally 1-4 days longer for Fall Green, Ozarka II, FA88-354, and FA88-310 or FA86-70 in the white rust and race 3 tests compared with the other cultivars tested. The latent periods for the race 4 tests could not be accurately estimated. Several of the cultivars and breeding lines have measurable levels of field resistance to both white rust and races 3 and 4 of downy mildew and can be used to help manage these economically important diseases of spinach. 3acultivars 3aquantitative analysis 3aPeronospora farinosa 3adisease prevalence 3aSpinacia oleracea 3apathogenicity 3aplant pathogenic fungi 3adisease resistance 3ainbred lines 3aAlbugo 3apathotypes 3aArkansas 0aWashington 0aselection 0asymptoms 0adisease distribution1 aCorrell, J.C.1 aMorelock, T.E.1 aMcNew, R.W.0 tPhytopathology.g1994 Apr., v. 84, no. 4 p.431-437x0031-949X7nnas  aDNAL  a19950303b19950309c00000000  aINDdMKS  aOther US 7aarticle03188naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001900110245014800129300001600277500001500293520188600308650001402194650001902208650002302227650004902250650002702299650001402326650002102340650002202361650001702383650001102400650001502411651001702426651001102443651001002454651001302464651001302477651001402490651001502504653001302519700001802532700001602550773007202566852000902638930003302647945001302680946001302693655001202706IND2044408120221119170905.0950202e199404  mnu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204440812DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWestra, A.A.G.10aEffect of interaction of inoculum dose, cultivar, and geographic location on the development of foliar symptoms of bacterial ring rot of potato  ap. 410-415.  a2019-12-05  aProportional hazards models were used to estimate hazard and survival functions for both the onset and maximum incidence of foliar symptoms of bacterial ring rot in three potato cultivars (Norchip, Norland, and Russet Burbank) grown at seven locations across the United States (Colorado, Maine, New York, North Dakota, Oregon, Washington, and Wisconsin) over the period 1988-1990. The models predicted a minimum of 50 and 82 days after planting for survival probabilities of P < 0.95 and P < 0.05 for symptom onset and maximum disease incidence, respectively. The time frame predicted for these events was affected by cultivar, location, and cultivar by location interaction. There was no proportional increase in the relative hazards for symptom onset and maximum disease incidence due to increased inoculum dose. An increased probability of survival, however, was associated with an increased incidence of right-censoring of the data in plants given the lower inoculum doses. The relationship between cultivar maturity and the relative hazard for maximum disease incidence was not consistent, an observation attributable to the fact that Russet Burbank displayed stunting (dwarf rosette) as an early season symptom of bacterial ring rot. Symptom onset and maximum disease incidence were influenced most by location and location by cultivar interaction, with certain locations displaying a trend toward an increased hazard for these events. Differences in the relative hazard for onset and maximum disease incidence among locations, in some cases, were associated with higher rates of right-censoring of the data. However, environmental conditions also appeared to influence the time when onset and maximum disease incidence occurred, because significant differences in the hazards for these events were observed in locations in which no right-censored observations were recorded. 3acultivars 3adisease models 3agenetic resistance 3aClavibacter michiganensis subsp. sepedonicus 3ageographical variation 3aequations 3ainoculum density 3aSolanum tuberosum 3apathogenesis 3aleaves 3aprediction 3aNorth Dakota 3aOregon 3aMaine 3aNew York 3aColorado 3aWisconsin 0aWashington 0asymptoms1 aArneson, C.P.1 aSlack, S.A.0 tPhytopathology.g1994 Apr., v. 84, no. 4 p.410-415x0031-949X7nnas  aDNAL  a19950303b19950309c00000000  aINDdMKS  aOther US 7aarticle03196naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002000110245006400130300001600194500001500210520186300225650001602088650001402104650001302118650001802131650002302149650001802172650002302190650001402213650001502227650002502242650003702267650001302304650001102317650004302328653002402371653002502395700002002420700001802440700001702458700002302475700001902498700001602517700001702533773007202550852000902622930003302631945001302664946001302677655001202690IND2044407120221119171109.0950202e199404  mnu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204440712DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLamprecht, S.C.10aPhytotoxicity of fumonisins and TA-toxin to corn and tomato  ap. 383-391.  a2019-12-05  aThe phytotoxic effects of five fumonisin mycotoxins produced by Fusarium moniliforme, i.e., fumonisin A1 (FA1), A2 (FA2), B1 (FB1), B2 (FB2), and B3 (FB3), together with the aminopolyol hydrolysis products of FB1 and FB2 (AP1 and AP2, respectively) and tricarballylic acid (TCA) were compared with the host-specific phytotoxin TA-toxin (TA) produced by Alternaria alternata f. sp. lycopersici. A leaf assay was performed on detached leaves of the tomato genotypes Asc/Asc (tolerant to TA) and asc/asc (sensitive to TA) at four concentrations (0.1, 1, 10, and 100 micromolar) of each toxin. Seedlings of corn cultivars A1849W and PNR 473 and the two tomato genotypes were also used to assay TA, FB1, FB2, and FB3. The fumonisins caused leaf necrosis identical to that caused by TA and FB1, FB2, FB3, and TA caused significantly (P = 0.01) more necrosis compared with the other metabolites tested. Sterile distilled water (control) and TCA caused no necrosis. Significantly (P = 0.01) more necrosis was observed on the asc/asc genotype compared with the Asc/Asc genotype. There was no significant (P > 0.05) difference between necrosis caused by autoclaved metabolites and that caused by nonautoclaved metabolites. The fumonisins caused dose-dependent reductions in shoot and root length and dry mass of corn and tomato seedlings identical to those caused by TA. The results indicated that TA and FB1 are more phytotoxic to seedlings than are FB2 and FB3. The effects of all four toxins were more pronounced on seedlings of the sensitive tomato genotype asc/asc than on the tolerant genotype Asc/Asc. No significant differences were recorded in the reaction of the two corn cultivars. The structural similarity of the fumonisin B mycotoxins and TA is therefore reflected by their phytotoxicity to detached tomato leaves as well as to corn and tomato seedlings. 3aphytotoxins 3acultivars 3aZea mays 3adose response 3agenetic resistance 3aphytotoxicity 3aFusarium fujikuroi 3abioassays 3amycotoxins 3aAlternaria alternata 3astructure-activity relationships 3agenotype 3aleaves 3aSolanum lycopersicum var. lycopersicum 0atricarballylic acid 0aGibberella fujikuroi1 aMarasas, W.F.O.1 aAlberts, J.F.1 aCawood, M.E.1 aGelderblom, W.C.A.1 aShephard, G.S.1 aThiel, P.G.1 aCalitz, F.J.0 tPhytopathology.g1994 Apr., v. 84, no. 4 p.383-391x0031-949X7nnas  aDNAL  a19950303b19950309c00000000  aINDdMKS  aOther US 7aarticle02860naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001500110245010300125300001600228520193200244650001902176650002002195650001702215650001602232650001402248650002202262650001502284650001802299653002202317700002502339773009002364852000902454930003302463945001302496946001302509655001202522IND2044405320221119171010.0950202e199408  mnu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204440532DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aScherm, H.10aEffects of fluctuating temperatures on the latent period of lettuce downy mildew (Bremia lactucae)  ap. 853-859.  aThe effects of fluctuating temperatures on the length of the latent period of downy mildew (Bremia lactucae) were studied on six lettuce cultivars. Potted plants were inoculated with B. lactucae, incubated at 13 C for 12 or 24 h to initiate infection, and subjected to different temperature treatments by moving them to growth chambers operating at diurnally alternating temperatures, moving them outdoors to naturally varying temperatures, or holding them at constant conditions. Subsets of plants incubated at fluctuating temperatures were returned to constant conditions at 24-h intervals to simulate a wide range in thermal exposure during the latent period. Cumulative numbers of sporulating lesions were recorded for each plant daily from 5 to 14 days after inoculation. Minimum and median latent periods (LP0 and LP50, respectively) were determined for each cultivar and temperature treatment at the end of the experiments. LP0 and LP50 were expressed as days, in degree-hours (accumulated hourly temperatures above a threshold of 0 C), and in units of accumulated hourly developmental rates derived from a nonlinear function fit to values of LP0 from a previous constant-temperature study. We found that the variability in LP0 and LP50 was greater when latent periods were measured in degree-hours (coefficient of variation [CV] between 6.2 and 30.9%) or developmental rates (6.4% less than or equal to CV less than or equal to 48.6%) than when they were measured in days (4.0% less than or equal to CV less than or equal to 17.5%). Thus, there seems to be little advantage in using degree-hours or developmental rates to model latent periods of lettuce downy mildew. Values of LP0 were shorter at low and longer at high temperatures with fluctuating temperatures compared to constant temperatures with the same mean. Possible reasons for the difference between constant- and fluctuating-temperature data are discussed. 3aLactuca sativa 3aBremia lactucae 3apathogenesis 3atemperature 3acultivars 3agenetic variation 3apathotypes 3apathogenicity 0alatent infections1 aBruggen, A.H.C. van.0 tPhytopathology.g1994 Aug., v. 84, no. 8 p.853-859wJournal:jnl44575x0031-949X7nnas  aDNAL  a19950303b19950309c00000000  aINDdMKS  aOther US 7aarticle
