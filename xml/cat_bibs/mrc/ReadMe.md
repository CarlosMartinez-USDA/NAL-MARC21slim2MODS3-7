## Contents
 - This file contained 64 marc records
 - It was transformed into MARCXML using MARCEdit 7.5
 - The MARCXML file was called cat-bibs.xml
 - The prefixes from cat-bibs.xml were removed to allow for testing of unprefixed elements. 
 - The prefixes were then readded to the XSLT to test cat-bibs.xml
 - Included here are the results of both.
