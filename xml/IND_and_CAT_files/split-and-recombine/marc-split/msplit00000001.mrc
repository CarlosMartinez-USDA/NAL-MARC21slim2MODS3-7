Hence the arrangement and hardening of rural roads remains an essential component of formation of arable areas on eroded terrains. Correct derivation of the roads, which need the protective measures or even re-projecting improves the state of the road network in economically effective way, as it allocates the available resources to the most threatened areas. The article presents a study on the actual state of the net of rural roads on loess upland terrain of Mielnica watershed. The analysis, performed on digital spatial data within GIS software, revealed considerable needs for improvements of rural roads on investigated area. Basing on the results, the map of improvement measures has been developed, presenting a spatial base for a decision support system for future land improvements and allocation of economical resources for the management of rural surface communication network in rural-environmental plans.  aPublisher supplied data 3acommunications technology 3acomputer software 3adecision support systems 3ageographic information systems 3ahighlands 3aloess 3aravines 3arural roads 3aspatial data 3awatersheds 0asoil erosion 0aloess watershed 0arural communication system 0aimprovement measures1 aNowocień, Eugeniusz1 aPodolski, Bugusław1 aSzewrański, Szymon1 aŻmuda, Romuald0 tAnnals of Warsaw University of Life Sciences, SGGW.g2010 July 14, v. 42, no. 1 p.169-176dVersitax2081-96177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2478/v10060-008-0075-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02222naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100006200151245005500213300001300268520109000281592002801371650002501399650002201424650001201446650001301458650001301471650001701484653001501501653002601516653001101542653002601553700002001579700002301599700002201622773011001644856008501754852000901839655001201848IND60604519120221122230052.0180717e20150528xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060451912DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jconrel.2015.03.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBorges, Ana Filipa1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8875-503110aOral films: Current status and future perspectives  ap. 1-19.  aPolymers are the most common excipients used in pharmaceutical dosage forms, and often new applications and innovative polymers appear aiming to overcome unmet needs in the drug formulation field. Orodispersible dosage forms based on polymeric matrices have currently demonstrated their prominence in accordance with the actual market requirements and patients' demands. The versatility of the polymeric oral films had proven their high value as suitable technological platforms for extension and adjustment to different delivery routes and promising markets. These are the main reasons for the increasing investment of several companies in this technology and their applicability in different therapeutic segments. This pharmaceutical form with a blustering beginning as a breath freshener had an emergent entrance in the Rx market proving its reliable value.

The major kinds of soil constructions and materials used for their creation are discussed. Quantitative aspects of the formation of layered soil constructions for irrigation farming and greening of urban areas under high anthropogenic loads are examined. Technological design of these constructions is based on modeling energy and mass fluxes in soil systems with the use of HYDRUS-1D software. Technological approaches for the application of biopolymer materials into different soil layers with the aim to increase the soil water capacity, protect the soils from secondary salinization and contamination with water-soluble pollutants, and improve the resistance of these materials toward biological destruction are discussed. The tests of the layered soil constructions in some countries of the Persian Gulf and in Moscow have proved their high efficiency. The productivity of green plantations can be increased by 1.5–2 times owing to the increased efficiency of water consumption and protection of the root zone from soluble salts under conditions of the natural or technogenic salinization (contamination) and deficit of precipitation.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiopolymers 3acomputer software 3aenergy 3afarming systems 3airrigation 3alayered soils 3amodels 3aplantations 3apollutants 3arhizosphere 3asalts 3asoil water 3atesting 3aurban areas 3aPersian Gulf1 aSadovnikova, N.

We hypothesized that the interaction of crop rotation, N source, and tillage in diversified cropping systems would promote microbially-mediated soil C and N cycling while attenuating inorganic N pools. We studied a cropping systems trial in its 10th year in Iowa, USA, which tested a 2-yr cropping system of corn (Zea mays L.)/soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] managed with conventional fertilizer N inputs and conservation tillage, a 3-yr cropping system of corn/soybean/small grain+red clover (Trifolium pratense L.), and a 4-yr cropping system of corn/soybean/small grain+alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.)/alfalfa. Three year and 4-yr cropping systems were managed with composted manure, reduced N fertilizer inputs, and periodic moldboard ploughing. We assayed soil microbial biomass carbon (MBC) and N (MBN), soil extractable NH4 and NO3, gross proteolytic activity of native soil, and potential activity of six hydrolytic enzymes eight times during the growing season. At the 0–20cm depth, native protease activity in the 4-yr cropping system was greater than in the 2-yr cropping system by a factor of 7.9, whereas dissolved inorganic N pools did not differ between cropping systems (P=0.292). At the 0–20cm depth, MBC and MBN the 4-yr cropping system exceeded those in the 2-yr cropping system by factors of 1.51 and 1.57. Our findings suggest that diversified crop cropping systems, even when periodically moldboard ploughed, support higher levels of microbial biomass, greater production of bioavailable N from SOM, and a deeper microbially active layer than less diverse cropping systems.  aPublisher supplied data  cUSDA National Institute of Food & Agriculturedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/1000058250 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aGlycine max 3aMedicago sativa 3aTrifolium pratense 3aZea mays 3aammonium compounds 3acarbon 3acomposted manure 3aconservation tillage 3acorn 3acrop rotation 3aenzyme activity 3aenzymes 3agrowing season 3amicrobial biomass 3anitrogen 3anitrogen fertilizers 3aplowing 3aproteolysis 3asoil 3asoil microorganisms 3asoybeans 3asupport systems 3aIowa 0aCrop rotation 0aAlternative agriculture 0aOrganic nitrogen 0aExtracellular enzyme activity 0aMicrobial biomass 0aSoil carbon1 aHofmockel, Kirsten S.0 tAgriculture, ecosystems & environment.g2017 Mar. 01, v. 240 p.66-76dElsevier B.V.aElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl34709x0167-88097nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agee.2017.01.0403Available from publisher's site  aAccepted Manuscript  aDNAL 7aarticle02126naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100006200147245008300209300001400292520084200306592002801148650002201176650001401198650001101212650001601223653003601239653003001275653001401305653002401319653002201343653002701365700001901392700002301411700002101434700006201455700002001517773010101537856008101638852000901719655001201728IND60599573520221117201359.0180702e20140310xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059957352DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tca.2013.12.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBerchenko, Nicolas1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7438-371610aPb–Te–O phase equilibrium diagram and the lead telluride thermal oxidation  ap. 64-69.  aTo clarify the behavior of thermally oxidized PbTe the phase equilibrium diagram was calculated taking into account the change of the standard Gibbs energies of formation with the temperature up to 873K.

The peptide bond demasking, the process which implies the removal of steric obstacles shielding polypeptide sites against enzymatic attack, was quantitatively evaluated with fluorescence spectroscopy by monitoring the exposure of Trp residues to the aqueous polar medium. This process obeys a first-order kinetic law that allowed us the determination of the rate constants of demasking k d . The fraction of initially masked bonds m, being able to convert during proteolysis to the demasked ones, and the fraction of unhydrolysable bonds n were calculated within the framework of a two-step model with consecutive demasking and hydrolysis steps. Parameters m and n were shown to decrease and increase, respectively, with the addition of ethanol.  aPublisher supplied data 3abeta-casein 3aethanol 3afluorescence emission spectroscopy 3ahydrolysis 3amodels 3amonitoring 3apH 3apolypeptides 3aproteolysis1 aStrauss, K.1 aVogel, V.1 aMäntele, W.0 tFood biophysics.g2015 Sept., v. 10, no. 3 p.309-315dSpringer USx1557-18587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11483-015-9391-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02822naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024004000113040001800153100002200171245007500193300001600268520106600284592002801350650001201378650001201390650001501402650001301417650001601430650000901446650001301455650001501468650000701483650001201490650001301502650001201515650002401527650002501551650002701576650003001603650001301633650003301646650002601679653001201705653001401717653001201731653001301743653001301756653001801769653001601787653001201803700002501815700002301840700002501863700002001888700002301908700001901931700002901950773010901979856008702088852000902175655001202184IND50064784920221121003132.0190402e20130815xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006478492DNAL7 a235611772pmid7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2013.01.0672doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDelchier, Nicolas10aEffects of industrial processing on folate content in green vegetables  ap. 815-824.  aFolates are described to be sensitive to different physical parameters such as heat, light, pH and leaching. Most studies on folates degradation during processing or cooking treatments were carried out on model solutions or vegetables only with thermal treatments.Our aim was to identify which steps were involved in folates loss in industrial processing chains, and which mechanisms were underlying these losses. For this, the folates contents were monitored along an industrial canning chain of green beans and along an industrial freezing chain of spinach.Folates contents decreased significantly by 25% during the washing step for spinach in the freezing process, and by 30% in the green beans canning process after sterilisation, with 20% of the initial amount being transferred into the covering liquid. The main mechanism involved in folate loss during both canning green beans and freezing spinach was leaching.Limiting the contact between vegetables and water or using steaming seems to be an adequate measure to limit folates losses during processing.  aPublisher supplied data 3acanning 3acooking 3afolic acid 3afreezing 3agreen beans 3aheat 3aleaching 3amonitoring 3apH 3aspinach 3asteaming 3awashing 2aFabaceaexchemistry 2aFolic Acidxanalysis 2aFood Handlingxmethods 2aFood, Preservedxanalysis 2aFreezing 2aSpinacia oleraceaxchemistry 2aVegetablesxchemistry 0aVitamin 0aBlanching 0aHeating 0aFreezing 0aLeaching 0aSterilisation 0aGreen beans 0aSpinach1 aRingling, Christiane1 aLe Grandois, Julie1 aAoudé-Werner, Dalal1 aGalland, Rachel1 aGeorgé, Stéphane1 aRychlik, Mike,1 aRenard, Catherine M.G.C.0 tFood chemistry.g2013 Aug. 15, v. 139, no. 1-4 p.815-824dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8139x0308-81467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2013.01.0673Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03989naa a2200709 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024004300113040001800156100005600174245012100230300001400351500001500365520183400380592002802214650001802242650002702260650001202287650003302299650001002332650001502342650001702357650001702374650001702391650002502408650001402433650001102447650001202458650001102470650003002481650001602511650001202527650001702539650001502556650002602571650001302597650002802610650002802638650002202666650002602688650003002714650003902744650002602783650001202809653002702821653002002848653002702868653001202895653001702907700002002924700001502944700001702959700001902976700002302995700001803018773013203036856009003168852000903258655001203267IND50070811320221119201114.0190318e20140103xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007081132DNAL7 a242206632pmid7 a10.1016/j.ijfoodmicro.2013.10.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGe, Chongtao1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0811-511210aImpact of phytopathogen infection and extreme weather stress on internalization of Salmonella Typhimurium in lettuce  ap. 24-31.  a2019-12-06  aInternalization of human pathogens, common in many types of fresh produce, is a threat to human health since the internalized pathogens cannot be fully inactivated/removed by washing with water or sanitizers. Given that pathogen internalization can be affected by many environmental factors, this study was conducted to investigate the influence of two types of plant stress on the internalization of Salmonella Typhimurium in iceberg lettuce during pre-harvest. The stresses were: abiotic (water stress induced by extreme weather events) and biotic (phytopathogen infection by lettuce mosaic virus [LMV]). Lettuce with and without LMV infection were purposefully contaminated with green fluorescence protein-labeled S. Typhimurium on the leaf surfaces. Lettuce was also subjected to water stress conditions (drought and storm) which were simulated by irrigating with different amounts of water. The internalized S. Typhimurium in the different parts of the lettuce were quantified by plate count and real-time quantitative PCR and confirmed with a laser scanning confocal microscope. Salmonella internalization occurred under the conditions outlined above; however internalization levels were not significantly affected by water stress alone. In contrast, the extent of culturable S. Typhimurium internalized in the leafy part of the lettuce decreased when infected with LMV under water stress conditions and contaminated with high levels of S. Typhimurium. On the other hand, LMV-infected lettuce showed a significant increase in the levels of culturable bacteria in the roots. In conclusion, internalization was observed under all experimental conditions when the lettuce surface was contaminated with S. Typhimurium. However, the extent of internalization was only affected by water stress when lettuce was infected with LMV.  aPublisher supplied data 3afresh produce 3aSalmonella Typhimurium 3adrought 3aLactuca sativa var. capitata 3aroots 3airrigation 3afluorescence 3ahuman health 3awater stress 3aLettuce mosaic virus 3apathogens 3aleaves 3awashing 3ahumans 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aplate count 3alettuce 3aplant stress 3asanitizers 3aenvironmental factors 3abacteria 2aColony Count, Microbial 2aConsumer Product Safety 2aFood Microbiology 2aLettucexmicrobiology 2aPlant Rootsxmicrobiology 2aSalmonella typhimuriumxphysiology 2aStress, Physiological 2aWeather 0aSalmonella Typhimurium 0aInternalization 0aSalmonella typhimurium 0aLettuce 0aWater stress1 aLee, Cheonghoon1 aNangle, Ed1 aLi, Jianrong1 aGardner, David1 aKleinhenz, Matthew1 aLee, JiYoung,0 tInternational journal of food microbiology.g2014 Jan. 03, v. 168-169 p.24-31dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl35565x0168-16057nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijfoodmicro.2013.10.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03541naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005700148245012100205300001100326520174000337592002802077596004502105650002602150650002002176650001602196650001902212650001802231650001402249650001102263650001102274651001102285651002202296651001302318651001002331700001702341700002302358700002202381700002102403700002302424700001802447700002402465700002102489700001902510700001802529700002002547700001802567700002002585700002302605700002102628700002502649700002002674700001902694700001902713773011502732856008302847852000902930655001202939IND60773319520221119020142.0220517e202205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077331952DNAL7 a10.1007/s00227-022-04050-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAguión, Alba1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5429-222712aA large-scale comparison of reproduction and recruitment of the stalked barnacle Pollicipes pollicipes across Europe  ap. 63.  aUnderstanding large-scale spatial and temporal patterns of marine populations is a central goal in ecology, which has received renewed attention under climate change. However, few studies explore the large-scale dynamics of populations using standardized protocols and during the same time frames. We studied the phenology and intensity of reproduction and recruitment for the intertidal stalked barnacle Pollicipes pollicipes over an European scale and described their potential linkages with environmental variables. This species supports profitable fisheries in the Iberian Peninsula (Spain and Portugal). In Brittany (France), we had observed a significant lower reproductive effort (long non-breeding season, short breeding period in summer) and low values of recruitment intensity. This pattern may be related to the fact that Brittany corresponds to the northern limit of the distribution of this species in continental Europe. On the Iberian Peninsula, the most different region was Galicia (Spain), with Asturias (Spain) and SW Portugal being more similar. In Galicia, we have observed a contradictory pattern characterized by the absence of a non-breeding period and by a shorter recruitment season than observed in other Iberian regions. Our results suggest that air temperature, SST and chlorophyll-a might be related to the variability in reproduction and recruitment patterns of P. pollicipes. Moreover, spring and early summer upwelling in SW Portugal and Galicia might be inhibiting recruitment in this period. At the northern limit, the expected increase in performance under climate change might facilitate the recovery of populations after exploitation, increasing the resilience of the resource to fishing pressure.  aPublisher supplied data  aPERCEBES (PCIN-2016-063)cera-learn 2020 3aPollicipes pollicipes 3aair temperature 3achlorophyll 3aclimate change 3alittoral zone 3aphenology 3aspring 3asummer 3aFrance 3aIberian Peninsula 3aPortugal 3aSpain1 aCruz, Teresa1 aAcuña, José Luis1 aBroudin, Caroline1 aCastro, João J.1 aDavoult, Dominique1 aDubert, Jesus1 aFernandes, Joana N.1 aGeiger, Katja J.1 aJacinto, David1 aMateus, David1 aMuñiz, Carlota1 aNolasco, Rita1 aPerrier, Lucile1 aQueiroga, Henrique1 aRomán, Salvador1 aSilva, T.q(Teresa),1 aThiébaut, Eric1 aVázquez, Elsa1 aMacho, Gonzalo0 tMarine biology.g2022 May, v. 169, no. 5 p.63-63dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl3080x0025-31627nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00227-022-04050-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02010naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245016800169300001600337520062500353592002800978650001501006650002301021650001701044650001701061650001201078650001301090650001101103650001601114650001201130650002501142650001801167653002401185653002801209653001201237653002401249700002101273700002801294700001701322700002401339773010801363856008401471852000901555655001201564IND60604573220221119202350.0180717e201512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060457322DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fuproc.2015.09.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGomis, Vicente10aEthanol dehydration via azeotropic distillation with gasoline fraction mixtures as entrainers: A pilot-scale study with industrially produced bioethanol and naphta  ap. 198-204.  aVarious hydrocarbons (n-hexane, cyclohexane, toluene, isooctane) and mixtures of them (binary, ternary or quaternary), as well as two different types of industrially produced naphtha (one obtained by direct distillation and the other from a catalytic cracking process), have been tested as candidate entrainers to dehydrate ethanol.

The photocatalytic activities of this composite were evaluated using Phenol Red (PR) dye (phenolsulfonphthalein class). In the dark, controlling factors, such as the pH and the adsorption of PR on Goethite surface were evaluated (before starting the photochemical experiments). It was found that the system PR‐Goethite present a small decrease in the main band of the dye (435 nm) which was explained by the low rate of adsorption of this dye on the Goethite. Also, we note that 40% of PR decolourisation was obtained after 200 min by the system PR‐Goethite‐hydrogen peroxide (H₂O₂) in dark due to the formation of •OH by thermal decomposition of H₂O₂ on the surface of Goethite. The effects of various experimental parameters, such as initial dye concentration, pH, photocatalyst amount, tert‐Butyl alcohol effect and H₂O₂ addition were investigated in the study of photodegradation of the dye. The results showed that the photodegradation of PR under UV‐A (365 nm) irradiation could be enhanced greatly in the presence of H₂O₂. Natural radiation tests (under sunlight) showed that degradation was faster comparing with that obtained using the artificial one at 365 nm. Studies of the mineralization using total organic carbon method under naturel light certify that this method, compatible with the environment, may be considered in the treatment of wastewater and generally in the process of removal of this kind of pollutant.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3adecolorization 3agoethite 3ahydrogen peroxide 3ahydroxyl radicals 3airon 3airradiation 3amineralization 3aorganic carbon 3apH 3aphenolsulfonphthalein 3aphotocatalysis 3aphotocatalysts 3aphotolysis 3apollutants 3asolar radiation 3athermal degradation 3aultraviolet radiation 3awastewater treatment1 aDebbache, Nadra1 aGhoul, Imen1 aSehili, Tahar1 aAbdessemed, Ala0 tWater and environment journal.g2018 Aug., v. 32, no. 3 p.358-365dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3949847x1747-65857nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/wej.123333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02461naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245010700167300001600274520118600290592002801476650004401504650001301548650001301561650001101574650001701585650001701602650002701619650001301646650002301659650001901682650001801701650002101719650001601740700003001756700002301786700002601809700002701835773008701862856008101949852000902030655001202039IND60440248120221123042411.0151024e201509  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6044024812DNAL7 a10.1007/s11483-015-9394-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFundo, Joana F.14aThe Effect of Polymer/ Plasticiser Ratio in Film Forming Solutions on the Properties of Chitosan Films  ap. 324-333.  aIn this work physical-chemical properties of chitosan/ glycerol film forming solutions (FFS) and the resulting films were analysed. Solutions were prepared using different concentrations of plasticising agent (glycerol) and chitosan. Films were produced by solvent casting and equilibrated in a controlled atmosphere. FFS water activity and rheological behaviour were determined. Films water content, solubility, water vapour and oxygen permeabilities, thickness, and mechanical and thermal properties were determined. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy was also used to study the chitosan/glycerol interactions.Results demonstrate that FFS chitosan concentration influenced solutions consistency coefficient and this was related with differences in films water retention and structure. Plasticiser addition led to an increase in films moisture content, solubility and water vapour permeability, water affinity and structural changes. Films thermo-mechanical properties are significantly affected by both chitosan and glycerol addition. FTIR experiments confirm these results.This work highlights the importance of glycerol and water plasticisation in films properties.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3achitosan 3aglycerol 3aoxygen 3apermeability 3aplasticizers 3arheological properties 3asolvents 3athermal properties 3awater activity 3awater content 3awater solubility 3awater vapor1 aGalvis-Sanchez, Andrea C.1 aDelgadillo, Ivonne1 aSilva, Cristina L.

The simplest and oldest statistical method for forecasting daily ET0 is to use the long-term monthly mean ET0 based on historical observations. Forecasts of reference crop evapotranspiration (ET0) can be calculated from Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) outputs and ET0 has the advantage of being more directly relevant to crop water requirements than temperature. This paper evaluates forecasts of ET0 made using the Bureau of Meteorology's operational NWP forecasts derived from the Australian Community Climate and Earth System Simulator – Global (ACCESS-G). The forecast performance for ET0 was quantified using the root mean squared error (RMSE), coefficient of determination (R2), anomaly correlation coefficient (ACC) and mean square skill score (MSSS). Daily ET0 forecasts for lead times up to 9 days were compared against ET0 calculated using hourly observations from the 40 automatic weather stations across Australia.It was found that using NWP forecast daily ET0 was better than using the long-term monthly mean ET0 for lead times up to 6 days, beyond which the long-term monthly mean was better. The average MSSS for ET0 forecasts across all stations varied between 66% and 12% for lead times of 1–6 days, respectively. Further, it was found that forecast performance for daily ET0 was highest in autumn for tropical climates and lowest in spring for temperate climates. Errors in incoming solar radiation were the most important source of ET0 forecast error, followed by air temperature, dew point temperature and wind speed, for all lead times. Also, it was found that the forecast performances for incoming solar radiation and mean wind speed were relatively poor compared with the air and dew point temperatures  aPublisher supplied data 3aAustralians 3aEarth system science 3aair 3aair temperature 3aautumn 3acorrelation 3adewpoint 3aevapotranspiration 3afarmers 3airrigation systems 3ameteorology 3aprediction 3arain 3asolar radiation 3aspring 3atemperate zones 3atropics 3aweather stations 3awind speed 3aAustralia 0aReference evapotranspiration 0aET0 0aForecasting 0aNumerical Weather Prediction 0aFAO561 aWestern, Andrew W.1 aNawarathna, Bandara1 aGeorge, Biju0 tAgricultural and forest meteorology.g2014 Aug. 15, v. 194 p.50-63dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl43250x0168-19237nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agrformet.2014.03.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03399naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100006200144245012500206300001800331520175200349592002802101650002402129650003602153650001702189650001302206650000902219650000902228650002102237650001402258650002202272650004402294650003702338650001902375653001302394653002702407653002702434653002102461653000902482653000802491653000802499653000702507653000802514700002602522700002302548700002402571700002502595700002302620773013902643856007802782852000902860655001202869IND60595445720180622000000.0180605e20180208xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059544572DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.7b183042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKoralewski, Marceli1http://orcid.org/0000-0002-4421-813810aMorphology and Magnetic Structure of the Ferritin Core during Iron Loading and Release by Magnetooptical and NMR Methods  ap. 7777-7787.  aFerritins are proteins, which serve as a storage and transportation capsule for iron inside living organisms. Continuously charging the proteins with iron and releasing it from the ferritin is necessary to assure proper management of these important ions within the organism. On the other hand, synthetic ferritins have great potential for biomedical and technological applications. In this work, the behavior of ferritin during the processes of iron loading and release was examined using multiplicity of the experimental technique. The quality of the protein’s shell was monitored using circular dichroism, whereas the average size and its distribution were estimated from dynamic light scattering and transmission electron microscopy images, respectively. Because of the magnetic behavior of the iron mineral, a number of magnetooptical methods were used to gain information on the iron core of the ferritin. Faraday rotation and magnetic linear birefringence studies provide evidence that the iron loading and the iron-release processes are not symmetrical. The spatial organization of the mineral within the protein’s core changes depending on whether the iron was incorporated into or removed from the ferritin’s shell. Magnetic optical rotatory dispersion spectra exclude the contribution of the Fe(II)-composed mineral, whereas joined magnetooptical and nuclear magnetic resonance results indicate that no mineral with high magnetization appear at any stage of the loading/release process. These findings suggest that the iron core of loaded/released ferritin consists of single-phase, that is, ferrihydrite. The presented results demonstrate the usefulness of emerging magnetooptical methods in biomedical research and applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiomedical research 3acircular dichroism spectroscopy 3aferrihydrite 3aferritin 3aions 3airon 3alight scattering 3amagnetism 3amaterials science 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3atransmission electron microscopy 3atransportation 0aferritin 0amagnetic birefringence 0aCotton−Mouton effect 0aFaraday rotation 0aMORD 0aNMR 0aTEM 0aCD 0aDLS1 aBalejčíková, Lucia1 aMitróová, Zuzana1 aPochylski, Mikołaj1 aBaranowski, Mikołaj1 aKopčanský, Peter0 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2018 Feb. 08, v. 10, no. 9 p.7777-7787dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.7b183043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02420naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001400148245017900162300001200341520100300353592002801356596005401384650001101438650001201449650001701461650001001478650002601488650002301514651001001537700001601547700001501563700001701578700001601595700001401611700001801625700001801643700001601661700001901677700001801696700001801714773015001732856008301882852000901965655001201974IND60773320020221119013921.0220726e202205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077332002DNAL7 a10.1007/s10661-022-09976-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Nan10aAnalysis of the heavy metals (As, Pb, Cu, Zn) by leaching and sequential extraction procedure from a municipal solid waste incinerator fly ash co-processing cement kiln plant  ap. 353.  aThe municipal solid waste incineration (MSWI) fly ash has been a major problem with the rapid development of the cities in China. And the cement rotary kiln co-processing technique is accepted as an effective method to dispose detrimental heavy metals in MSWI fly ash. This study focused on presented the total leaching content and the morphological distribution of the heavy metals in cement solid samples doped with MSWI fly ash. These samples were collected from a MSWI fly ash co-processing cement rotary kiln plant. The leaching test and the sequential extraction procedure were adopted to measure the migration characteristic of As, Pb, Cu, and Zn. In addition, the leachability of clinker samples under different simulated environmental conditions was also detected to analyze the security of the cement product doped with MSWI fly ash. This work demonstrates the feasibility of the cement rotary kiln MSWI fly ash co-processing technique and provides a scientific guidance to related plant.  aPublisher supplied data  a2020YFB0606304cNational Key R&D Program of China 3acement 3afly ash 3aincinerators 3akilns 3amunicipal solid waste 3awaste incineration 3aChina1 aGe, Zhimeng1 aLi, Aihong1 aWei, Baiyong1 aLi, Yinming1 aZhang, Ye1 aShen, Qianjin1 aWang, Tuqiang1 aWu, Xueqian1 aCao, Xiangdong1 aGuo, Jianping1 aWang, Zhaojia0 tEnvironmental monitoring and assessment.g2022 May, v. 194, no. 5 p.353-353dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl33242x0167-63697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-022-09976-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02558naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002100144245007700165300001800242520124700260592002801507650002801535650002301563650002401586650002301610650001301633653002101646653001501667653002901682653003501711653001101746700001401757700001901771700006201790700001901852700006301871773013901934856007802073852000902151655001202160IND60595445820221118230029.0180605e20180228xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059544582DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.7b183052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDavydovich, Oleg10aCoordinated Responsive Arrays of Surface-Linked Polymer Islands—CORALs  ap. 7459-7468.  aThe concept of co-ordinated responsive arrays of surface-linked islands (polymer CORALs) is introduced. This study targets a responsive system capable of revealing or covering the substrate surface in response to environmental changes in a reversible way. A convenient method of fabrication of polymer CORALs is proposed. It is based on microphase separation that occurs in thin films of supramolecular assemblies of block copolymers with reactive blocks. Such blocks form nanometer-size domains that may serve as anchors for surface-linked polymer islands. Two characteristics of the islands are critically important for the switching function: high grafting density within the islands and small lateral separation that allows interactions between polymer chains grafted to the neighboring islands. This combination permits complete coverage of the substrate surface upon exposure to a good solvent (relaxed state). In a weak solvent, the chains collapse within the islands, thus revealing the substrate (compact state). The morphology of the CORALs in both states and some details of the switching process were studied with atomic force microscopy, grazing incidence small-angle scattering, and coarse-grained molecular dynamic simulations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aatomic force microscopy 3acomposite polymers 3ainterface phenomena 3amolecular dynamics 3asolvents 0agrafted polymers 0ainterfaces 0ablock copolymer assembly 0amolecular dynamics simulations 0aGISAXS1 aChu, Elza1 aFriar, Zachary1 aSmilgies, Detlef-M.1http://orcid.org/0000-0001-9351-581X1 aMoore, Preston1 aSidorenko, Alexander1http://orcid.org/0000-0002-3109-76050 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2018 Feb. 28, v. 10, no. 8 p.7459-7468dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.7b183053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03093naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100005400144245014400198300002000342520178700362592002802149650002802177650002102205650001502226650001502241650001902256650001302275650001702288650001302305653001802318653003002336653001402366653002002380653002102400700001602421700002802437773014202465856007902607852000902686655001202695IND60595445920221118230316.0180622e20180306xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059544592DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.7b183102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Haizeng1http://orcid.org/0000-0002-8180-280010aSolution-Processed Interfacial PEDOT:PSS Assembly into Porous Tungsten Molybdenum Oxide Nanocomposite Films for Electrochromic Applications  ap. 10520-10527.  aElectrochromic devices (ECDs) have received increased attention for applications including optoelectronics, smart windows, and low-emission displays. However, it has been recognized that the ECDs with transition-metal oxide (TMO) electrodes possess a high charge transport barrier because of their poor electrical conductivity, which limits their electrochromic performance. In this work, we addressed this limitation by utilizing a conjugated polymer to fabricate an organic–inorganic nanocomposite film that decreases the charge transport barrier of typical TMO electrodes. Using a conventional spray-layer-by-layer (spray-LbL) deposition technique, we demonstrate an electrochromic film composed of porous layers of tungsten molybdenum oxide (W₀.₇₁Mo₀.₂₉O₃) nanorods permeated with an interconnected conductive layer of poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS). The introduction of PEDOT:PSS is shown to significantly reduce the charge transport barrier, allowing the nanocomposite W₀.₇₁Mo₀.₂₉O₃/PEDOT:PSS electrode to exhibit significantly improved electrochromic switching kinetics compared with the deposited W₀.₇₁Mo₀.₂₉O₃ films. Furthermore, the optical contrast of the nanocomposite electrode was observed to be superior to both pure PEDOT:PSS and W₀.₇₁Mo₀.₂₉O₃ electrodes, with a performance that exceeded the linearly predicted contrast of combining the pure films by 23%. The enhanced performance of the PEDOT:PSS-intercalated porous W₀.₇₁Mo₀.₂₉O₃ nanocomposite electrodes and the facile synthesis through a spray-LbL method demonstrate a viable strategy for preparing fast assembling high-performance nanocomposite electrodes for a wide variety of electrochemical devices.  aPublisher supplied data 3aelectrical conductivity 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3amolybdenum 3ananocomposites 3ananorods 3apolystyrenes 3atungsten 0ananocomposite 0atungsten molybdenum oxide 0aPEDOT:PSS 0aelectrochromism 0asolution-process1 aMcRae, Liam1 aElezzabi, Abdulhakem Y.0 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2018 Mar. 06, v. 10, no. 12 p.10520-10527dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.7b183103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02335naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100005200139245009900191300001600290500002000306520111500326592002801441650002501469650002301494650001301517650002101530650002101551650001601572650001701588650000901605650001401614650000701628650002101635650001001656650001001666650001201676700002401688773013101712856007301843852000901916655001201925IND60611366920221120050531.0180831e201808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061136692DNAL7 a10.1111/wej.123292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuo, Lin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5296-833410aPotential of citric acid to alter pH and metal uptake in reeds in acid mine drainage solutions  ap. 333-340.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aPhragmites australis (common reed) is often used to treat acid mine drainage (AMD) sites contaminated with high concentrations of heavy metals and low pH. This study investigated the effects of different levels (low 0.34 g/L, middle 17.86 g/L and high 33.62 g/L) of the biodegradable chelator citric acid (CA) on pH change, metal (i.e. Fe, Al and Mn) accumulation and translocation in reeds cultured in aqueous AMD contaminated media for 4 and 12 weeks. The results indicated that CA inhibited further deceases in AMD pH as well as increased Fe and Mn accumulation in both belowground and above ground tissues of reeds. As expected, increasing CA dosage and treatment time increased metal accumulation in plants. By 12 weeks, 0.18 ± 0.01 mg Mn/g, 56.78 ± 7.63 mg Fe/g and 0.60 ± 0.01 mg Al/g were accumulated in roots; while 0.06 ± 0.01 mg Mn/g; 6.38 ± 0.06 mg Fe/g; and 0.19 ± 0.01 mg Al/g were sequestered in stems of reeds treated with 33.62 g/L CA. Further research is needed to study the application of CA to enhance the phytoremediation efficiency of AMD contaminated field.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPhragmites australis 3aacid mine drainage 3aaluminum 3abiodegradability 3achelating agents 3acitric acid 3aheavy metals 3airon 3amanganese 3apH 3aphytoremediation 3aroots 3astems 3atissues1 aCutright, Teresa J.0 tWater and environment journal.g2018 Aug., v. 32, no. 3 p.333-340dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3949847x1747-65857nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/wej.123293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02571naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245016400166300001600330520119100346592002801537650004801565650002801613650001801641650001701659650001301676650001601689650002501705650000901730650002001739650000701759650001501766650002101781650001601802650001101818700001501829700002001844700001401864700001701878700001601895700002501911773008701936856008102023852000902104655001202113IND60440248620221121230236.0151024e201509  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6044024862DNAL7 a10.1007/s11483-015-9406-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRodríguez, R.10aTransformation Kinetics During Fermented Milk Production Using Lactobacillus Johnsonii (La1) and Streptococcus Thermophillus: A Comparison With Yogurt Inoculum  ap. 375-384.  aYogurt is commonly produced by a fermentation process of milk using two lactic acid bacteria: Streptococcus thermophillus and Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus. In this work, a different starter culture was used to initiate the fermentation process: the probiotic Lactobacillus johnsonii and S. thermophillus. The impact in the kinetics of aggregation and chemical modification due to the use of different starter culture is discussed. This alternative culture produces, in relation to the usual process, a delay in the lactic acid production and consequently, in the pH profiles modifying: a) the transformation of inorganic phosphorous into an organic one, b) the exopolyssacharides production and c) the aggregation process at a rate between 10 and 100 times depending on temperature and inocula concentrations. For the alternative inoculum, two regimes were observed: the first one, corresponding to the primary metabolism, is where the delay in milk transformation happens to affect, to a large extent, this regime and partly the next one. The second regime seems similar to the standard one but, as mentioned, shifted in time. A comparison between both processes is shown.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus 3aLactobacillus johnsonii 3aStreptococcus 3afermentation 3ainoculum 3alactic acid 3alactic acid bacteria 3amilk 3amilk production 3apH 3aprobiotics 3astarter cultures 3atemperature 3ayogurt1 aVargas, S.1 aQuintanilla, F.1 aTrejo, A.1 aRegalado, C.1 aGarcía, B.1 aGonzález-Torres, M.0 tFood biophysics.g2015 Sept., v. 10, no. 3 p.375-384dSpringer USx1557-18587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11483-015-9406-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01461naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001500140245011300155300001800268520029300286592002800579650001300607650002600620650002700646650002300673650001700696650003900713650003400752650001000786700002100796700002100817700002200838700002200860773013300882856007501015852000901090655001201099IND60658650720221119154254.0190826e20100528xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065865072DNAL7 a10.1039/c0cc00259c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKubo, Yuji10aResorcin[4]arene cavitand with 1,3,2-benzodiazaborolyl walls as a fluorescence receptor for ammonium cations  ap. 3604-3606.  aResorcin[4]arene cavitand 1 with 1,3,2-benzodiazaborolyl walls was newly synthesized.

Self-association of the di-O-caffeoylquinic acid isomers has been studied as well. Caffeine-di-O-caffeoylquinic acid isomers association constants were measured. The value of the association constant of the caffeine-di-O-caffeoylquinic acid complexes is compatible with previous studies and within the typical range of reported association constants for other caffeine-polyphenols complexes. Structural features of the three different complexes have also been investigated by NMR spectroscopy combined with quantum chemical calculations, and the complex conformation is discussed. Our results show that stacking interactions drive the formation of the complexes and that multiple equilibria are present in the interaction of caffeine with 3,4-di-O-caffeoylquinic acid and 4,5-di-O-caffeoylquinic acid while the complex with 3,5-di-O-caffeoylquinic acid seems to be better defined.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aaqueous solutions 3acaffeine 3aisomers 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy1 aPapamokos, George1 aDreyer, Jens1 aCarloni, Paolo1 aNavarini, Luciano0 tFood biophysics.g2015 Sept., v. 10, no. 3 p.235-243dSpringer USx1557-18587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11483-014-9368-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03937naa a2200661 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100003000153245020700183300001800390520191600408592002802324650001402352650000802366650001502374650001502389650001302404650001202417650002202429650002302451650001202474650001202486650001702498650001102515650002602526650002102552650002202573650001502595650001602610650001102626650001702637650001302654650001302667650001602680650000902696650000902705650001502714653003102729653002402760653002202784653001602806653001402822653002402836700002402860700002402884700002302908700003302931700002802964700002602992700002303018773012503041856008803166852000903254655001203263IND60583135120221119091438.0201111e20180201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058313512DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2017.08.2712doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFranco, Jefferson Honorio10aIdentification of biotransformation products of disperse dyes with rat liver microsomes by LC-MS/MS and theoretical studies with DNA: Structure-mutagenicity relationship using Salmonella/microsome assay  ap. 1093-1103.  aAzo dyes are known as a group of substances with DNA damage potential that depend on the nature and number of azo groups connected to aromatic rings (benzene and naphthalene), chemical properties, e.g. solubility and reactive functional groups, which significantly affect their toxicological and ecological risks. In this paper, we used in vitro models to evaluate the metabolism of selected textile dyes: Disperse Red 73 (DR 73), Disperse Red 78 (DR 78) and Disperse Red 167 (DR 167). To evaluate the mutagenic potential of the textile dyes, the Salmonella mutagenicity assay (Ames test) with strains TA 98 and TA 100 in the presence and absence of the exogenous metabolic system (S9) was used. DR73 was considered the most mutagenic compound, inducing both replacement base pairs (TA 100) and also changing frameshift (TA 98) mutations that are reduced in the presence of the S9 mixture. Furthermore, we used rat liver microsomes in the same experimental conditions of the S9 mixture to metabolize the dyes and the resultant solutions were analyzed using a liquid chromatography coupled to a quadrupole linear ion trap mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) to investigate the metabolites formed by the in vitro biotransformation. Based on this experiment, we detected and identified two biotransformation products for each textile dye substrate analyzed. Furthermore, to evaluate the interaction and reactivity of these compounds with DNA, theoretical calculations were also carried out. The results showed that the chemical reaction occurred preferentially at the azo group and the nitro group, indicating that there was a reduction in these groups by the CYP P450 enzymes presented in the rat microsomal medium. Our results clearly demonstrated that the reduction of these dyes by biological systems is a great environmental concern due to increased genotoxicity for the body of living beings, especially for humans.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAmes test 3aDNA 3aDNA damage 3aSalmonella 3aazo dyes 3abenzene 3abiotransformation 3achemical reactions 3aenzymes 3afabrics 3agenotoxicity 3ahumans 3aliquid chromatography 3aliver microsomes 3amass spectrometry 3ametabolism 3ametabolites 3amodels 3amutagenicity 3amutagens 3amutation 3anaphthalene 3arats 3arisk 3asolubility 0aIn vitro biotransformation 0aRat liver microsome 0aMass spectrometry 0aTextile dye 0aAmes Test 0aComputational study1 aSilva, Bianca F. da1 aOliveira, Regina V.1 aMeireles, Gabriela1 aOliveira, Danielle Palma de,1 aCastro, Alexandre A. de1 aRamalho, Teodorico C.1 aZanoni, Maria V.B.0 tScience of the total environment.g2018 Feb. 01, v. 613-614 p.1093-1103dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2017.08.2713Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02353naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245010000168300001600268520110700284592002801391650004401419650001101463650001401474650001701488650001601505650002001521650001201541650002801553650001901581650001201600650001301612650001801625650001501643650001301658650001101671650001201682700002001694700002801714773008701742856008101829852000901910655001201919IND60440248920221121230257.0151024e201509  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6044024892DNAL7 a10.1007/s11483-014-9379-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStortz, Terri A.14aThe Role of Lecithin and Solvent Addition in Ethylcellulose-Stabilized Heat Resistant Chocolate  ap. 253-263.  aLarge deformation mechanical testing and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy were used to gain further insights into the mechanism of heat resistance in ethylcellulose- (EC) stabilized chocolate prepared using the solvent substitution method. Here we show that the presence of lecithin at the surface of sucrose reduced heat resistance by impeding interactions between EC and sucrose. These techniques along with fluorescence microscopy also showed that the EtOH used in solvent substitution chocolate was able to remove the EtOH soluble lecithin phospholipids from the surface of the sucrose. Removal of the lecithin and the slight solubility of sucrose in EtOH both have positive impacts on heat resistance. It was also found that EtOH may reduce heat resistance by destabilizing the casein micelle in samples made with skim milk powder. Finally, results have indicated that EC is likely able to interact with the lactose in skim milk powder and the starch in cocoa powder leading to greater heat resistance. These findings will be useful in developing the ideal heat resistant chocolate formula.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3acasein 3achocolate 3acocoa powder 3adeformation 3adried skim milk 3aethanol 3afluorescence microscopy 3aheat tolerance 3alactose 3amicelles 3aphospholipids 3asolubility 3asolvents 3astarch 3asucrose1 aLaredo, Thamara1 aMarangoni, Alejandro G.0 tFood biophysics.g2015 Sept., v. 10, no. 3 p.253-263dSpringer USx1557-18587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11483-014-9379-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03423naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100005500153245016900208300001600377520151000393592002801903650001101931650001701942650001501959650002601974650002102000650001002021650000902031650001202040650002302052650001602075650001802091650002302109650002602132650002102158650001402179650001202193650001602205650000902221650002402230650002502254650003002279650001302309650001302322653003502335653003002370653003002400653003102430653002602461700001702487700001402504700002002518700001602538700001502554700001202569773011902581856008802700852000902788655001202797IND60583135320221119091551.0201111e20180115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058313532DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2017.08.2752doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSun, Weimin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3456-817710aPaddy soil microbial communities driven by environment- and microbe-microbe interactions: A case study of elevation-resolved microbial communities in a rice terrace  ap. 884-893.  aRice paddies are a significant source of the greenhouse gas methane, which mainly originates from microbial activity. Methane generation in anaerobic systems involves complex interactions of multiple functional microbial groups. Rice paddies installed in hilly terrain are often terraced, providing multiple quasi-independent plots differing primarily in their elevation up a hillside. This represents an excellent study site to explore the influence of environmental factors on microbial communities and interactions among microbial populations. In this study, we used a combination of geochemical analyses, high-throughput amplicon sequencing, and statistical methods to elucidate these interactions. Sulfate, total nitrogen, total iron, and total organic carbon were determined to be critical factors in steering the ecosystem composition and function. Sulfate-reducing bacteria predominated in the rice terrace microbial communities, and Fe(III)-reducing and methane-oxidizing bacteria were abundant as well. Biotic interactions indicated by co-occurrence network analysis suggest mutualistic interactions among these three functional groups. Paddy-scale methane production may be affected by competition among methanogens and sulfate- and Fe(III)-reducing bacteria, or by direct methane oxidation by methane-oxidizing bacteria.Microbial communities were characterized in rice terrace. The environment- and microbe-microbe interactions indicated the mitigation of sulfate and Fe on methane production.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3acase studies 3aecosystems 3aenvironmental factors 3agreenhouse gases 3ahills 3airon 3amethane 3amethane production 3amethanogens 3amethanotrophs 3amicrobial activity 3amicrobial communities 3anitrogen content 3aoxidation 3apaddies 3apaddy soils 3arice 3asoil microorganisms 3astatistical analysis 3asulfate-reducing bacteria 3asulfates 3aterraces 0aRice paddy microbial community 0aSulfate reducing bacteria 0aFe(III) reducing bacteria 0aMethane oxidizing bacteria 0aCo-occurrence network1 aXiao, Enzong1 aPu, Zilun1 aKrumins, Valdis1 aDong, Yiran1 aLi, Baoqin1 aHu, Min0 tScience of the total environment.g2018 Jan. 15, v. 612 p.884-893dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2017.08.2753Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02608naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245022800166300001400394520119400408592002801602650002501630650002001655650001401675650001801689650001201707650001301719650001601732650002201748653002601770653003301796653003101829653004601860653002901906653002201935700002501957700002501982773010102007856008102108852000902189655001202198IND60599574720221117201351.0180702e20140210xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059957472DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tca.2013.12.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBahadur, Indra10aEffects of temperature and concentration on interactions in methanol+ethyl acetate and ethanol+methyl acetate or ethyl acetate systems: Insights from apparent molar volume and apparent molar isentropic compressibility study  ap. 87-94.  aThe density (d) and speed of sound (u) for the binary systems (methanol+ethyl acetate) and (ethanol+methyl acetate or ethyl acetate) were measured at 298.15, 303.15, 308.15 and 313.15K and at atmospheric pressure in this work whereas the system (methanol+methyl acetate) was measured in the literature.

The limiting apparent molar volume was used to obtain information about (solute–solvent) and (solute–solute) interactions.

Here, we have developed Fe₃O₄@C (FC) and Fe–Fe₃O₄@C (FFC) hybrid nanorings via a hydrothermal method coupled with a chemical catalytic vapor deposition technique. FC and FFC hybrid nanorings have fine carbon coating while their size can easily be tunable in a certain range from 80–130 to 90–140 nm. The optimized FC and FFC hybrid nanorings bear minimum reflection loss (RL) values of −39.1 dB at 15.9 GHz and −32.9 dB at 17.1 GHz, respectively, whereas FFC shows an effective absorption bandwidth (RL values < −10 dB) ranged from 5.2 to 18 GHz. Such an enhanced microwave absorption performance of hybrid nanorings is mainly due to the suitable impedance characteristics, multilevel interfaces, and polarization features in nanorings. This work provides an approach to design hybrid materials having a complex structure to enhance the microwave absorption properties.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorbents 3aelectronics 3acoatings 3aabsorption 3acarbon 3ahot water treatment 3avapors 0acatalytic chemical vapor deposition 0acarbon overcoat 0airon oxide 0amicrowave absorption 0ahybrid nanorings 0aimpedance1 aXiao, Xiangyun1 aDeng, Longjiang1 aTian, Wei1 aWang, Xin1 aMahmood, Nasir1http://orcid.org/0000-0002-8340-10581 aDou, ShiXue0 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2018 Feb. 22, v. 10, no. 11 p.9369-9378dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.7b183243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03705naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245013000166300001600296520183000312592002802142650002102170650001402191650001402205650001602219650002402235650001702259650001702276650002102293650001902314650001902333650001902352650002202371650001802393650001802411650001802429650001502447650001002462650001702472650000902489650002502498650001202523650002502535650003202560653002202592653002002614653001102634653001102645653000902656653002302665700002002688700002302708700005702731700001802788700002102806700002702827773012302854856008102977852000903058655001203067IND60604574520221119202015.0180717e20150313xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060457452DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jep.2014.08.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNisar, Albeena10aModulation of T-helper cytokines and inflammatory mediators by Atropa accuminata.

An array of pro-inflammatory mediators (PGE2 NO, IL-1β and LTB4) and T-cell-mediated cytokines (IL-2, TNF-a, IFN-c, IL-4, IL-10, IL-12, IL-17, IL-6) were assayed in arthritic paw tissue homogenate of the treated animals. In addition the effects on arthritic lesions, changes in body weight; haematological (Hb, ESR, WBC and RBC) and biochemical parameters (SOD, GSH, GR) and the serum markers (CRP, RF) were also observed.Significant anti-arthritic activity was observed for AAEE in the polyarthiritis test both in the developing and developed phase of the disease. This was associated with dose dependant suppression of pro-inflammatory mediators (PGE2, NO, IL-1β and LTB4)., Th1-Th17 cytokines (IL-2, TNF-α, IFN-γ, IL-12, IL-17, IL-6) and upregulation of Th2 cytokines (IL-4 and IL-10). AAEE was also observed to protect rats against the primary and secondary arthritic lesions, body weight changes and haematological perturbations. In addition, inhibitory effects of AAEE on biochemical parameters and the serum markers further confirmed that it reduced signs on chronic inflammatory responses.The present investigation therefore suggested that AAEE is a potent anti-arthritic agent. The multipronged attack on the inflammatory mediators and T-helper cytokines and strong potency of AAEE may have relevance for inhibition of the chronic inflammatory responses in arthritis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAtropa acuminata 3aadjuvants 3aarthritis 3ablood serum 3abody weight changes 3aerythrocytes 3ainflammation 3ainterferon-gamma 3ainterleukin-10 3ainterleukin-12 3ainterleukin-17 3ainterleukin-1beta 3ainterleukin-2 3ainterleukin-4 3ainterleukin-6 3aleukocytes 3amales 3anitric oxide 3arats 3asuperoxide dismutase 3atissues 3atraditional medicine 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha 0aAtropa accuminata 0aHerbal medicine 0aTNF-α 0aIL-1β 0aIL-4 0aIL-10, IL-17, IL-61 aAkhter, Nayeema1 aSingh, Gurudarshan1 aMasood, Akbar1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7288-13081 aMalik, Akhter1 aBanday, Basharat1 aZargar, Mohammed Afzal0 tJournal of ethnopharmacology.g2015 Mar. 13, v. 162 p.215-224dElsevier Ireland LtdwJournal:jnl30651x0378-87417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jep.2014.08.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04773naa a2200709 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001400153245022800167300001600395520272200411592002803133650002103161650002503182650001703207650002303224650001203247650001003259650001303269650001203282650001303294650001303307650002103320650001903341650002003360650000903380650001603389650001603405650002703421650000903448650001003457650001803467650001903485650001203504650002303516650001003539650001103549650001203560650002103572650001303593650001803606650000903624650001203633650002503645650001503670651002603685653001203711653001603723653001803739653001903757653001503776700001503791700001403806700001503820773011903835856008803954852000904042655001204051IND60583135420221119091504.0190206e20180315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058313542DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2017.08.2782doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAmuno, S.10aChronic arsenicosis and cadmium exposure in wild snowshoe hares (Lepus americanus) breeding near Yellowknife, Northwest Territories (Canada), part 1: Evaluation of oxidative stress, antioxidant activities and hepatic damage  ap. 916-926.  aPrevious gold mining activities and arsenopyrite ore roasting activities at the Giant mine site (1948 to 2004) resulted in the release of high amounts of arsenic and trace metals into the terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems of Yellowknife, Northwest Territories, Canada. While elevated levels of arsenic has been consistently reported in surface soils and vegetation near the vicinity of the Giant mine area and in surrounding locations, systematic studies evaluating the overall health status of terrestrial small mammals endemic to the area are lacking. The purpose of this present study was to evaluate and comparatively assess the biochemical responses and histopathological effects induced by chronic arsenic and cadmium exposure in wild snowshoe hares breeding near the city of Yellowknife, specifically around the vicinity of the abandoned Giant mine site and in reference locations. Analysis included measurement of total arsenic and cadmium concentration in nails, livers, kidneys, bones, stomach content of hares, in addition to histopathological evaluation of hepatic and ocular lesions. Biochemical responses were determined through measurement of lipid peroxidation levels and antioxidant enzymes activities (catalase, superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, and glutathione disulfide). The results revealed that arsenic concentration was 17.8 to 48.9 times higher in the stomach content, and in the range of 4 to 23 times elevated in the nails of hares from the mine area compared to the reference location. Arsenic and cadmium levels were also noted to be increased in the bones, renal and hepatic tissues of hares captured near the mine area compared to the reference site. Specifically, hares from the mine area showed nail cadmium levels that was 2.3 to 17.6 times higher than those from the reference site. Histopathological examination of the eyes revealed no specific ocular lesions, such as lens opacity (cataracts) or conjunctivitis; however, hares from both locations exhibited hepatic steatosis (fatty liver change). Lipid peroxidation levels were relatively increased and accompanied with reduced antioxidant enzyme activities in hares from the mine area compared to the hares from the reference site. The results of this preliminary study suggest that the snowshoe hares breeding near the vicinity of Yellowknife, including near the Giant mine area have been chronically exposed to elevated levels of arsenic and cadmium, which consequently led to the increased levels of oxidative stress and perturbation of antioxidant defense system in exposed animals. The results of this present study constitute the first observation of chronic arsenicosis in wild small mammal species in Canada.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLepus americanus 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3aaquatic ecosystems 3aarsenic 3abones 3abreeding 3acadmium 3acatalase 3acataract 3achronic exposure 3aconjunctivitis 3aenzyme activity 3aeyes 3afatty liver 3aglutathione 3aglutathione peroxidase 3agold 3ahares 3ahealth status 3ahistopathology 3akidneys 3alipid peroxidation 3aliver 3amining 3aopacity 3aoxidative stress 3aroasting 3asmall mammals 3asoil 3astomach 3asuperoxide dismutase 3avegetation 3aNorthwest Territories 0aArsenic 0aArsenicosis 0aSmall mammals 0aSnowshoe hares 0aGiant mine1 aJamwal, A.1 aGrahn, B.1 aNiyogi, S.0 tScience of the total environment.g2018 Mar. 15, v. 618 p.916-926dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2017.08.2783Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02626naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245007500163300001400238520137800252592002801630650001201658650001701670650001401687650001701701650001301718650001601731650000901747650001701756650001701773653001201790653001801802653001601820653002101836653001701857653001601874653001001890653002801900700002101928700002301949773011801972856008102090852000902171655001202180IND60520812220221120105627.0160525e20110711xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052081222DNAL7 a10.2478/v10060-008-0092-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAnna, Hadam10aEffect of hydrogel on the turf grass species growing under salt stress  ap. 47-55.  aHydrogels can absorb huge amount of water and so are able to decrease the drought stress in plants. They are used in horticulture and agriculture for years. It is possible that they may be applied also on the grass near - road areas. Because of water deficient and high salinity growth of plants in these conditions is however hard. Meanwhile, too high concentration of ions in soil can decrease efficacy of hydrogel, since it can absorb water and cations as well. Nevertheless there is still too less studies on such problem. From this point of view it seems that the complex assessment of hydrogels effect on urban lawn grass is needed. The aim of the study was therefore the evaluation of grasses condition after their cultivation under salt stress with and without hydrogels amendment. Experience was conducted for four months in the controlled green house conditions. The efficacy of hydrogels amendment was measured by the grass reactions (turfs height, fresh matter content and level of membranes injury) on three levels of salinity. The results allowed concluding that, concentration of the road de- icing salt was the main factor, which affected condition of all tested species. This reaction was independent on the presence of hydrogel. Nevertheless under low and medium saline conditions watersorbent weakened significantly influence of salt stress on the grass.  aPublisher supplied data 3acations 3ahorticulture 3ahydrogels 3aplant growth 3asalinity 3asalt stress 3asoil 3aturf grasses 3awater stress 0adrought 0awater sorbent 0asalt stress 0aurban lawn grass 0ahydrosorbent 0astres solny 0asusza 0atrawniki przyuliczne MS1 aMariola, Wrochna1 aZbigniew, Karaczun0 tAnnals of Warsaw University of Life Sciences, SGGW.g2011 July 11, v. 43, no. 1 p.47-55dVersitax2081-96177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2478/v10060-008-0092-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03283naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003500135040001800170100005700188245006300245300001200308506007600320520171500396592002802111506003702139650002202176650001102198650001402209650001602223650002002239650002302259650001602282650001302298650001702311650001402328650001702342650001102359650001802370650001402388650001402402650002202416650001002438650002102448651001602469700001902485700002902504700001602533773011302549856008202662852000902744655001202753IND60591002420221207115544.0191016e201812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059100242DNAL7 a295402382pmid7 aPMC58529682pmcid7 a10.1186/s13071-018-2712-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZingg, Silvia1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4489-182414aThe negative effect of wood ant presence on tick abundance  ap. 164.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Ticks and tick-borne pathogens are a global problem for the health of humans and their livestock. Wood ants are important ecosystem engineers in forests worldwide. Although both taxa are well studied, little is known about their interactions under natural conditions. The purpose of the present field study was to test whether European red wood ants (Formica polyctena) influence the abundance of Ixodes tick populations in temperate forests. METHODS: Data collection took place in 130 sampling plots located at 26 ant nest sites paired with 26 control sites in northwestern Switzerland. At each sampling plot, tick abundance, ant abundance, ant nest volume and habitat variables (describing litter, vegetation and microclimate) were measured. We used linear mixed-effect models to analyze the abundance of questing ticks as a function of ant abundance and habitat variables. RESULTS: Ant nest volume, rather than the presence of ants, had a significant negative effect on tick abundance. The number of ticks decreased from 11.2 to 3.5 per 100 m² if the volume of the adjacent ant nest increased from 0.1 m³ to 0.5 m³. Additionally, high vegetation cover and litter depth had negative and positive relationships with tick abundance, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: We showed that the number of questing ticks was negatively correlated with the size of red wood ant nests. Further studies are needed to identify the mechanisms that drive the relationship. Possible mechanisms include the repellent effect of ant formic acid, and the predatory behavior of wood ants. The present field study suggests that red wood ants provide a new ecosystem service by reducing the local abundance of Ixodes ticks.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aFormica polyctena 3aIxodes 3aant nests 3acorrelation 3adata collection 3aecosystem services 3aformic acid 3ahabitats 3ahuman health 3alivestock 3amicroclimate 3amodels 3anesting sites 3apathogens 3apredation 3atemperate forests 3aticks 3avegetation cover 3aSwitzerland1 aDolle, Patrick1 aVoordouw, Maarten Jeroen1 aKern, Maren0 tParasites & vectors.g2018 Dec., v. 11, no. 1 p.164-164dBioMed CentralwJournal:jnl4347486x1756-33057nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13071-018-2712-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02476naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002200148245007900170300001600249520102700265592002801292650002601320650001901346650002401365650000901389650001901398650001601417650001301433650001301446650001201459650001601471650002001487650001001507653001901517653002601536653001801562653001101580653001901591700003601610700002301646700002701669700002401696700002201720700002501742773012301767856008301890852000901973655001201982IND60113403720221118020630.0190412e201304  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011340372DNAL7 a10.1053/j.jepm.2013.05.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBercier, Marjorie10aSalivary Gland Adenocarcinoma in a Domestic Rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus)  ap. 218-224.  aA 2.4kg, 7-year-old, female Rex rabbit was presented with a 4-month history of a left-sided head tilt, difficulty in mastication, lethargy, and chronic wasting. Diagnostic testing of the patient revealed a severe heterophilic leukocytosis and radiographic images of the skull radiographs indicated irregularity of the left tympanic bulla. A computed tomographic scan highlighted a heterogeneously contrast-enhancing mass, ventral and rostral to the left tympanic bulla, with contrast enhancement of the meninges on the left, consistent with an aggressive neoplasm. The patient was euthanized and the mass was identified as a salivary gland adenocarcinoma. The gland of origin is suspected to be the left parotid, owing to its location and close association with normal parotid tissue. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first report of a salivary gland adenocarcinoma in a domestic rabbit. A computed tomography (CT) scan and histopathology examination were useful modalities for identifying the neoplasm in this case.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOryctolagus cuniculus 3aadenocarcinoma 3acomputed tomography 3ahead 3ahistopathology 3amastication 3ameninges 3apatients 3arabbits 3aradiography 3asalivary glands 3askull 0aadenocarcinoma 0aOryctolagus cuniculus 0aparotid gland 0arabbit 0asalivary gland1 aSanchez-Migallon Guzman, David,1 aStockman, Jonathan1 aZwingenberger, Allison1 aVapniarsky, Natalia1 aLowenstine, Linda1 aHawkins, Michelle G.0 tJournal of exotic pet medicine.g2013 Apr., v. 22, no. 2 p.218-224dElsevier Inc.wJournal:J000000103x1557-50637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1053/j.jepm.2013.05.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03028naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001500149245015100164300001600315520138700331592002801718650001801746650001001764650001101774650001301785650002401798650001401822650001501836650001101851650001301862650002001875650001501895650002201910650002501932650002101957650001101978650000701989650001901996650001602015650001502031650002502046650001002071653003102081653002402112653002502136653001502161653001902176653001402195700002002209700001302229700002002242773009502262856008402357852000902441655001202450IND60557743720221121183656.0190416e201706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055774372DNAL7 a10.1016/j.algal.2016.10.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLuo, Shuai10aAlgal-microbial community collaboration for energy recovery and nutrient remediation from wastewater in integrated photobioelectrochemical systems  ap. 527-539.  aIntegration of algae and cyanobacteria with microbial fuel cell bioelectrochemical systems (BES) can significantly improve energy recovery and nutrient remediation in wastewater treatment. One innovative option is an integrated photobioelectrochemical system (IPB). Algae can contribute to BES function as an organic feedstock to support bacterial growth, by assisting anode bacteria to generate electricity, by providing oxygen from photosynthesis as a cathode electron acceptor, and by removing N and P from effluent water. However, critical interactions among bacteria-algae communities are poorly understood and practical questions such as light and pH conditions and taxa selection need more research to optimize microbial interactions and promote IPB function. Only a few ‘lab weed’ algal and cyanobacterial taxa have been tried in IPB systems but algae offer additional metabolic flexibility such as mixotrophy, to further process organic carbon, and nutrient hyperaccumulation, which have yet to be examined for potential in wastewater IPB treatment systems. This review aims to serve as a guide for wastewater bioenergy engineers to address challenges in IPB systems, and identifies a need for more collaboration between algal biologists and engineers to optimize algal-microbial community collaboration and work towards improved sustainability of wastewater treatment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCyanobacteria 3aalgae 3aanodes 3abacteria 3abioelectrochemistry 3abioenergy 3abiologists 3acarbon 3acathodes 3aenergy recovery 3afeedstocks 3ahyperaccumulators 3amicrobial fuel cells 3amicrobial growth 3aoxygen 3apH 3aphotosynthesis 3aremediation 3awastewater 3awastewater treatment 3aweeds 0aBioelectrochemical systems 0aMicrobial fuel cell 0aWastewater treatment 0aMixotrophy 0aPhotosynthesis 0aNutrients1 aBerges, John A.1 aHe, Zhen1 aYoung, Erica B.0 tAlgal research.g2017 June, v. 24 p.527-539dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12360x2211-92647nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.algal.2016.10.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03126naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001400144245009600158300001800254520140400272592002801676650001501704650002101719650001401740650002701754650001301781650002001794650001901814650001201833650001801845650001901863650001001882650001701892650000901909653001601918653001501934653002501949653001901974653001801993700001602011700001302027700001602040700001802056700001302074700001702087700001702104700005702121700001802178700001502196700002502211700001802236700005602254773013902310856007802449852000902527655001202536IND60595279220221118054555.0180602e20180228xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059527922DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.7b177642doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJia, Chao10aAnisotropic, Mesoporous Microfluidic Frameworks with Scalable, Aligned Cellulose Nanofibers  ap. 7362-7370.  aCellulose paper has been extensively used in microfluidic analytical devices because of its hydrophilic nature. However, cellulose is randomly packed in paper without any particular orientation or channels within the bulk of the material, necessitating a complicated design of hydrophilic microchannels to guide the liquid flow. Herein, we develop an anisotropic mesoporous microfluidic framework (named as white wood) with aligned cellulose nanofibers and inherent microchannels via a facile one-step delignification process from natural wood. The hydrophilic nature of the innate microchannels in white wood makes it ideal for application as a pump-free microfluidic chip, exhibiting a fast and anisotropic liquid and large solid particle (as demonstrated with carbon nanotubes) mass transport, with a high transport speed along the channel direction approximately five times faster than that perpendicular to the channel direction. The anisotropic mass transport is further exemplified in the fabrication of chitosan films with aligned microstructures and birefringence, formed by virtue of unidirectional capillary forces exerted by the microchannels. We envision that our anisotropic mesoporous framework can have great applications to pump-free microfluidics, and the simple preparation process will pave a new way for the development of microfluidic devices based on chemically modified wood.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanisotropy 3acarbon nanotubes 3acellulose 3acellulose microfibrils 3achitosan 3adelignification 3ahydrophilicity 3aliquids 3amass transfer 3amicrostructure 3apaper 3aporous media 3awood 0aanisotropic 0amesoporous 0acellulose nanofibers 0amass transport 0amicrofluidics1 aJiang, Feng1 aHu, Piao1 aKuang, Yudi1 aHe, Shuaiming1 aLi, Tian1 aChen, Chaoji1 aMurphy, Alan1 aYang, Chunpeng1http://orcid.org/0000-0001-7075-33561 aYao, Yonggang1 aDai, Jiaqi1 aRaub, Christopher B.1 aLuo, Xiaolong1 aHu, Liangbing1http://orcid.org/0000-0002-9456-93150 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2018 Feb. 28, v. 10, no. 8 p.7362-7370dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.7b177643Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02956naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245012700169300001800296520178300314592002802097650003102125650001202156650001102168650000902179650001502188650001602203650001102219650000902230650002202239650001502261650001102276650003002287651001402317700002102331700002102352773009502373856008102468852000902549655001202558IND60121044720221118115721.0150214e201404  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012104472DNAL7 a10.1007/s00382-014-2088-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBarreiro, Marcelo10aRole of the global oceans and land–atmosphere interaction on summertime interdecadal variability over northern Argentina  ap. 1733-1753.  aThis study uses experiments with an atmospheric general circulation model (AGCM) to address the role of the oceans and the effect of land–atmosphere coupling on the predictability of summertime rainfall over northern Argentina focusing on interdecadal time scales during 1901–2006. Ensembles of experiments where the AGCM is forced with historical sea surface temperature (SST) in the global, Pacific and tropical-North Atlantic domains are used. The role of land–atmosphere interaction is assessed comparing the output of simulations with active and climatological soil moisture. A maximum covariance analysis between precipitation and SST reveals the impact of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation and the equatorial–tropical South Atlantic on rainfall over northern Argentina. Model simulations further show that while the dominant influence comes from the Pacific basin, the Atlantic influence can explain a large transition from dry to wet decades over northern Argentina during the beginning of the 1970s. Analysis of anomalies before and after the transition reveals an upper level anticyclonic circulation off the Patagonian coast with barotropic structure. This circulation enhances the moisture transport and convergence in northern Argentina and, together with enhanced evaporation, increased the rainfall after 1970. The SST pattern is dominated by cold conditions in the equatorial Atlantic and warm eastern Pacific and South Atlantic. We also found that land–atmosphere interaction leads to a representation of the long term rainfall evolution over northern Argentina that is closer to the observed one. Moreover, it leads to a smaller dispersion among ensemble members, thus resulting in a larger signal-to-noise ratio.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGeneral Circulation Models 3aclimate 3acoasts 3acold 3acovariance 3aevaporation 3aoceans 3arain 3asimulation models 3asoil water 3asummer 3asurface water temperature 3aArgentina1 aDíaz, Nicolás,1 aRenom, Madeleine0 tClimate dynamics.g2014 Apr., v. 42, no. 7-8 p.1733-1753dSpringer-Verlagx0930-75757nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00382-014-2088-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02563naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003500135040001800170100002700188245010900215300001200324506007600336520100500412592002801417506003701445650002001482650001201502650002001514650002101534650001901555650000901574650001401583650003001597650000901627650002201636651001101658651001001669700002501679700001801704700001801722700002501740700002501765700002001790700005501810773011301865856008201978852000902060655001202069IND60591002520221207115538.0191016e201812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059100252DNAL7 a295549462pmid7 aPMC58595302pmcid7 a10.1186/s13071-018-2767-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOliveira, Ana Cristina10aMolecular detection of Anaplasma bovis, Ehrlichia canis and Hepatozoon felis in cats from Luanda, Angola  ap. 167.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Molecular identification of tick-borne pathogen infection in cats from Africa is scarce. The presence of bacterial (Anaplasma and Ehrlichia) and protozoal (Babesia and Hepatozoon) agents was investigated in blood samples from 102 domestic cats from Luanda, Angola, by polymerase chain reaction and DNA sequencing. RESULTS: Three cats (2.9%) were found infected with Ehrlichia canis, three (2.9%) with Hepatozoon felis and one (1.0%) with Anaplasma bovis. The prevalence of infections with one single agent was 4.9%, and that of infection with two agents (i.e. E. canis and H. felis) was 1.0%. In total, six cats (5.9%) were found infected with at least one of the detected tick-borne agents. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report of A. bovis, E. canis and H. felis in cats from Angola. To the best of our knowledge, A. bovis is also being reported for the first time in domestic cats outside of Japan. Cats are at a low to moderate risk of being infected with tick-borne agents in Luanda.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAnaplasma bovis 3aBabesia 3aEhrlichia canis 3aHepatozoon felis 3ablood sampling 3acats 3apathogens 3apolymerase chain reaction 3arisk 3asequence analysis 3aAngola 3aJapan1 aLuz, Maria Francisca1 aGranada, Sara1 aVilhena, Hugo1 aNachum-Biala, Yaarit1 aLopes, Ana Patrícia1 aCardoso, Luís,1 aBaneth, Gad1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7549-13050 tParasites & vectors.g2018 Dec., v. 11, no. 1 p.167-167dBioMed CentralwJournal:jnl4347486x1756-33057nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13071-018-2767-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03494naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100001700141245013200158520203700290592002802327650002602355650003102381650001902412650001502431650001102446650003302457650002002490650002902510650002602539650003802565650001002603650000802613650001302621650001302634650001402647650000902661650001102670651001602681700001502697700002102712700003002733700002402763700001802787773012202805856007602927852000903003655001203012IND60794096720221121115205.0220922e20220913xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079409672DNAL7 a10.3390/ani121823862doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDo, Duy Ngoc10aApplying Machine Learning Algorithms for the Classification of Mink Infected with Aleutian Disease Using Different Data Sources  aAmerican mink (Neogale vison) is one of the major sources of fur for the fur industries worldwide, whereas Aleutian disease (AD) is causing severe financial losses to the mink industry. A counterimmunoelectrophoresis (CIEP) method is commonly employed in a test-and-remove strategy and has been considered a gold standard for AD tests. Although machine learning is widely used in livestock species, little has been implemented in the mink industry. Therefore, predicting AD without using CIEP records will be important for controlling AD in mink farms. This research presented the assessments of the CIEP classification using machine learning algorithms. The Aleutian disease was tested on 1157 individuals using CIEP in an AD-positive mink farm (Nova Scotia, Canada). The comprehensive data collection of 33 different features was used for the classification of AD-infected mink. The specificity, sensitivity, accuracy, and F1 measure of nine machine learning algorithms were evaluated for the classification of AD-infected mink. The nine models were artificial neural networks, decision tree, extreme gradient boosting, gradient boosting method, K-nearest neighbors, linear discriminant analysis, support vector machines, naive bayes, and random forest. Among the 33 tested features, the Aleutian mink disease virus capsid protein-based enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was found to be the most important feature for classifying AD-infected mink. Overall, random forest was the best-performing algorithm for the current dataset with a mean sensitivity of 0.938 ± 0.003, specificity of 0.986 ± 0.005, accuracy of 0.962 ± 0.002, and F1 value of 0.961 ± 0.088, and across tenfold of the cross-validation. Our work demonstrated that it is possible to use the random forest algorithm to classify AD-infected mink accurately. It is recommended that further model tests in other farms need to be performed and the genomic information needs to be used to optimize the model for implementing machine learning methods for AD detection.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAleutian mink disease 3aCarnivore amdoparvovirus 1 3aNeovison vison 3aalgorithms 3acapsid 3acounterimmunoelectrophoresis 3adata collection 3adecision support systems 3adiscriminant analysis 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3afarms 3afur 3agenomics 3aindustry 3alivestock 3amink 3amodels 3aNova Scotia1 aHu, Guoyu 1 aDavoudi, Pourya 1 aShirzadifar, Alimohammad 1 aManafiazar, Ghader 1 aMiar, Younes 0 tAnimals.g2022 Sept. 13, v. 12, no. 18dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2274x2076-26157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ani121823863Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02480naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001500147245007500162520118000237592002801417650001601445650001701461650001301478650001001491650001401501650003101515650003001546650001501576650002201591650001701613650002501630653001501655653002101670700001401691700001801705700001301723700001501736700001801751700001201769700001701781700001701798773011601815856008201931852000902013655001202022IND60754616920221118063701.0211213e20220130xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075461692DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jep.2021.1147492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Xian10aTherapeutic effect of baicalin on inflammatory bowel disease: A review  aBaicalin (BI) is an important biologically active flavonoid isolated from the root of Scutellaria radix (Huang Qin). Traditionally Scutellaria radix was the common drug of dysentery. As the main flavonoid compound, there is a distribution tendency of baicalin to the intestinal tract and it has a protective effect on the gastrointestinal tract.This review aims to compile up-to-date and comprehensive information on the efficacy of baicalin in vitro and in vivo, about treating inflammatory bowel disease. Relevant information on the therapeutic potential of baicalin against inflammatory bowel disease was collected from the Web of Science, Pubmed and so on. Additionally, a few books and magazines were also consulted to get the important information.The mechanisms of baicalin against inflammatory bowel disease mainly include anti-inflammation, antioxidant, immune regulation, maintenance of intestinal barrier, maintenance of intestinal flora balance. Also, BI can relieve parts of extraintestinal manifestations (EIMs), and prevent colorectal cancer.Baicalin determined the promising therapeutic prospects as potential supplementary medicines for the treatment of IBD.  aPublisher supplied data 3aScutellaria 3aantioxidants 3abaicalin 3adrugs 3adysentery 3ainflammatory bowel disease 3aintestinal microorganisms 3aintestines 3aprotective effect 3atherapeutics 3atraditional medicine 0aIntestinal 0aDrug interaction1 aXie, Long1 aLong, Jiaying1 aLiu, Kai1 aLü, Jing,1 aLiang, Youdan1 aCao, Yi1 aDai, Xiaolin1 aLi, Xiaofang0 tJournal of ethnopharmacology.g2022 Jan. 30, v. 283 p.114749-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl30651x0378-87417nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jep.2021.1147493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01256naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100001800112245011700130300001600247506002800263520027600291592002800567506003700595650001100632650001100643650001100654650000900665653002600674653002800700653001700728653001500745700002000760773014100780852000900921655001200930IND60785200620221207132019.0150609e201204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078520062DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPopescu, Şt.10aResearch regarding soil maintenance methods in apple tree cultivation in the cârcinov-arges fruit growing basin  ap. 179-188.  aResource is Open Access  aIn the last decade, the introduction of genetically resistant varieties and the reduction of phytosanitary treatments the led to lower production costs, less chemically polluted fruits, making from apple tree cultivation a profitable culture in the consecrated countries.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aapples 3abasins 3afruits 3asoil 0aFlorina apple variety 0aGeneros apple varieties 0asoil tillage 0asoil mulch1 aTeodorescu, Al.0 tCurrent Trends in Natural Sciences.g2012 Apr., v. 1, no. 1 p.179-188dEditura Universitatii din PitestiwJournal:27829x2284-953X7nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle03061naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001900143245012800162500001400290520168200304592002801986650002002014650001402034650001302048650001402061650002002075650001402095650000902109650001302118650001902131650001902150650001102169650001502180650001502195650001402210650001602224650000702240650001602247650001202263650002502275700002502300700002402325700002502349773011902374856007702493852000902570655001202579IND60729237120221121050115.0210228e20210203xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072923712DNAL7 a10.3390/foods100203212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMella, Camila 10aImpact of the Simulated Gastric Digestion Methodology on the In Vitro Intestinal Proteolysis and Lipolysis of Emulsion Gels  aNAL-light  aThe aim of this work was to study the impact of the methodology of in vitro gastric digestion (i.e., in terms of motility exerted and presence of gastric emptying) and gel structure on the degree of intestinal proteolysis and lipolysis of emulsion gels stabilized by whey protein isolate. Emulsions were prepared at pH 4.0 and 7.0 using two homogenization pressures (500 and 1000 bar) and then the emulsions were gelled by heat treatment. These gels were characterized in terms of texture analysis, and then were subjected to one of the following gastric digestion methods: in vitro mechanical gastric system (IMGS) or in vitro gastric digestion in a stirred beaker (SBg). After gastric digestion, the samples were subjected to in vitro intestinal digestion in a stirred beaker (SBi). Hardness, cohesiveness, and chewiness were significantly higher in gels at pH 7.0. The degree of proteolysis was higher in samples digested by IMGS–SBi (7–21%) than SBg–SBi (3–5%), regardless of the gel’s pH. For SBg–SBi, the degree of proteolysis was not affected by pH, but when operating the IMGS, higher hydrolysis values were obtained for gels at pH 7.0 (15–21%) than pH 4.0 (7–13%). Additionally, the percentage of free fatty acids (%FFA) released was reduced by 47.9% in samples digested in the IMGS–SBi. For the methodology SBg–SBi, the %FFA was not affected by the pH, but in the IMGS, higher values were obtained for gels at pH 4.0 (28–30%) than pH 7.0 (15–19%). Our findings demonstrate the importance of choosing representative methods to simulate food digestion in the human gastrointestinal tract and their subsequent impact on nutrient bioaccessibility.  aPublisher supplied data 3abioavailability 3achewiness 3acohesion 3adigestion 3adigestive tract 3aemulsions 3agels 3ahardness 3aheat treatment 3ahomogenization 3ahumans 3ahydrolysis 3aintestines 3alipolysis 3amethodology 3apH 3aproteolysis 3atexture 3awhey protein isolate1 aQuilaqueo, Michelle 1 aZúñiga, Rommy  N.1 aTroncoso, Elizabeth 0 tFoods.g2021 Feb. 03, v. 10, no. 2dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21651x2304-81587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/foods100203213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04395naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100005400149245010300203300001600306506011700322506007600439520227700515592002802792506003702820650002202857650001502879650002102894650002102915650001702936650001002953650000902963650001802972650001402990650002003004650002703024650001203051650001703063650001503080650001003095650001903105650002903124650001903153650001703172650001903189650001403208650001003222653001203232653001703244653001603261653001703277653001403294700001703308700005503325700006303380700006603443773016703509856008403676852000903760655001203769IND60736134520221207122045.0220809e202109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073613452DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aninu.2020.11.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBautil, An1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7034-187X10aFeed endoxylanase type and dose affect arabinoxylan hydrolysis and fermentation in ageing broilers  ap. 787-800.  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aDespite the general use of endoxylanases in poultry feed to improve broiler performance, the abundance of different endoxylanase products and the variable response to their application in the field prevent a clear understanding of endoxylanase functionality in vivo. To gain insight into this functionality, we investigated the impact of endoxylanase type (Belfeed from Bacillus subtilis versus Econase XT from Nonomuraea flexuosa) and dose (10, 100, 1,000 mg/kg) in combination with broiler age on arabinoxylan (AX) hydrolysis and fermentation in broilers (Ross 308) fed a wheat-soy based diet. In a digestibility trial and a performance trial, a total of 1,057 one-day-old chicks received the control diet or 1 of the 6 endoxylanase supplemented wheat-soy based diets with, respectively, 5 replicate cages and 8 replicate pens per dietary treatment per trial. The AX content and structure, the AX digestibility values and the short-chain fatty acids produced were analysed at the level of the ileum, caeca and excreta at d 11 and 36. Endoxylanase supplementation resulted in a more extensive solubilisation of wheat AX and a reduction in the intestinal viscosity compared to the control (P < 0.05). A high endoxylanase dose was, however, required to obtain increased hydrolysis of the dietary AX along the gastrointestinal tract against the control (P < 0.001). Depending on the type of endoxylanase, a pool of AX with distinct physicochemical properties was created. The B. subtilis endoxylanase created a large pool of soluble AX in the ileum, thereby increasing ileal viscosity compared to broilers fed an endoxylanase from N. flexuosa (P < 0.001). The N. flexuosa endoxylanase mainly triggered caecal AX fermentation in young broilers, by delivering easily fermentable AX substrates with a low degree of polymerisation (P = 0.03). The effects were particularly present in young broilers (d 11). From this study, it is clear that the type and dose of endoxylanase added to wheat-soy based diets determine the nature of AX substrates formed. These, in turn, affect the intestinal viscosity and the interplay between the dietary AX compounds and microbiota, hence dictating AX digestion at young broiler ages and performance outcomes towards slaughter age.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aBacillus subtilis 3aNonomuraea 3aage at slaughter 3aanimal nutrition 3aarabinoxylan 3acecum 3adiet 3adigestibility 3adigestion 3adigestive tract 3aendo-1,4-beta-xylanase 3aexcreta 3afermentation 3ahydrolysis 3aileum 3amicroorganisms 3anutritional intervention 3apolymerization 3apoultry feed 3asolubilization 3aviscosity 3awheat 0aBroiler 0aArabinoxylan 0aFeed enzyme 0aEndoxylanase 0aDigestion1 aBuyse, Johan1 aGoos, Peter1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3854-65061 aBedford, Michael R.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5308-42901 aCourtin, Christophe M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1203-90630 tAnimal nutrition.g2021 Sept., v. 7, no. 3 p.787-800dElsevier B.V.aChinese Association of Animal Science and Veterinary MedicinewJournal:23216x2405-65457nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aninu.2020.11.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03222naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100001800166245014600184300001800330520156400348592002801912650002101940650001401961650001401975650002201989650001602011650001902027650001202046650001102058650001402069650003002083650002802113650002602141650002002167650003702187650003602224650003902260650003702299650001102336650004802347650005102395700001402446700001402460700001202474700001802486700001502504773011602519856004802635852000902683655001202692IND50067529020221118110941.0130727e201307  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006752902DNAL7 a236864732pmid7 a10.1007/s12010-013-0287-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Jiaqiang10aHigh Levels of Glucose Induces a Dose-Dependent Apoptosis in Human Periodontal Ligament Fibroblasts by Activating Caspase-3 Signaling Pathway  ap. 1458-1471.  aPeriodontitis is one of the main complications of diabetes mellitus and many researches have been done on the relationship between periodontitis and diabetes mellitus, but too much are still unclear, especially the mechanisms by which high glucose induces damage of periodontal ligament fibroblasts. So in this study, we investigated the effects of different concentration of high glucose on apoptosis in human periodontal ligament fibroblasts and the possible mechanisms involved. Human periodontal ligament fibroblasts were cultured and subjected to glucose of different concentration (5.5, 15, 25, and 35 mM) for 24 h. Apoptosis was studied by flow cytometry, caspase assays, fluorescent real-time PCR and Western blot. We also determined Fas/FasL expression was by Western blot. The application of different concentration of high glucose induced a concentration-dependent increase of apoptosis and the activity of caspase-3 in cultured human periodontal ligament fibroblasts. Furthermore, inhibitor of caspase-3 could prevent the high-glucose-induced apoptosis in human periodontal ligament fibroblasts. Protein levels of Fas and FasL remained unchanged. These data indicate that high glucose induces a concentration- and caspase-3-dependent increase of apoptosis in cultured human periodontal ligament fibroblasts in vitro. Activation of caspase-3 caused by high glucose is independent of Fas/FasL signaling pathways system. These results suggest a novel mechanism for the regulation of human periodontal ligament fibroblasts apoptosis by high glucose.  aPublisher supplied data 3aWestern blotting 3aapoptosis 3acaspase-3 3adiabetes mellitus 3afibroblasts 3aflow cytometry 3aglucose 3ahumans 3aligaments 3apolymerase chain reaction 2aApoptosisxdrug effects 2aCaspase 3xmetabolism 2aCells, Cultured 2aDose-Response Relationship, Drug 2aEnzyme Activationxdrug effects 2aFibroblastsxcytologyxmetabolism. 2aGlucosexadministration & dosage 2aHumans 2aPeriodontal Ligamentxcytologyxmetabolism. 2aSignal Transductionxdrug effectsxphysiology.1 aJiang, Yi1 aMao, Jing1 aGu, Bin1 aLiu, Hongchen1 aFang, Bing0 tApplied biochemistry and biotechnology.g2013 July, v. 170, no. 6 p.1458-1471dSpringer-Verlagx0273-22897nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12010-013-0287-y  aDNAL 7aarticle03409naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094024002200128024001900150040001800169100001600187245010600203300001400309506007600323520148600399592002801885506003701913650001201950650002201962650001701984650001702001650002002018650002102038650001502059650001902074650001502093650002202108650002102130650001202151650001302163650002002176650001302196650001502209650001502224650001902239650002502258653001502283653003702298653002302335653002602358653002702384653001502411700002202426700002602448700001802474700003602492700002202528700002502550773010702575856008002682852000902762655001202771IND60602151020221207081357.0180709e20150901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060215102DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ab.2015.05.0072doi7 aPMC47327212pmcid7 a259832362pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Ying10aOptimization of human dendritic cell sample preparation for mass spectrometry-based proteomic studies  ap. 40-50.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aDendritic cells (DCs) are specialized leukocytes that orchestrate the adaptive immune response. Mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomic study of these cells presents technical challenges, especially when the DCs are human in origin due to the paucity of available biological material. Here, to maximize MS coverage of the global human DC proteome, different cell disruption methods, lysis conditions, protein precipitation, and protein pellet solubilization and denaturation methods were compared. Mechanical disruption of DC cell pellets under cryogenic conditions, coupled with the use of RIPA (radioimmunoprecipitation assay) buffer, was shown to be the method of choice based on total protein extraction and on the solubilization and identification of nuclear proteins. Precipitation by acetone was found to be more efficient than that by 10% trichloroacetic acid (TCA)/acetone, allowing in excess of 28% more protein identifications. Although being an effective strategy to eliminate the detergent residue, the acetone wash step caused a loss of protein identifications. However, this potential drawback was overcome by adding 1% sodium deoxycholate into the dissolution buffer, which enhanced both solubility of the precipitated proteins and digestion efficiency. This in turn resulted in 6 to 11% more distinct peptides and 14 to 19% more total proteins identified than using 0.5M triethylammonium bicarbonate alone, with the greatest increase (34%) for hydrophobic proteins.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aacetone 3aadaptive immunity 3abicarbonates 3adenaturation 3adendritic cells 3adeoxycholic acid 3adetergents 3ahydrophobicity 3aleukocytes 3amass spectrometry 3anuclear proteins 3apellets 3apeptides 3aprotein content 3aproteome 3aproteomics 3asolubility 3asolubilization 3atrichloroacetic acid 0aProteomics 0aMonocyte-derived dendritic cells 0aSample preparation 0aProtein precipitation 0aProtein solubilization 0aLC–MS/MS1 aBottinelli, Dario1 aLisacek, Frédérique1 aLuban, Jeremy1 aStrambio-De-Castillia, Caterina1 aVaresio, Emmanuel1 aHopfgartner, Gérard0 tAnalytical biochemistry.g2015 Sept. 01, v. 484 p.40-50dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11652x0003-26977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ab.2015.05.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03037naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002200143245013500165500001400300520175100314592002802065650001202093650001602105650001302121650001302134650001402147650001902161650001602180650000902196650000702205650001302212650002102225650001502246650001702261700002602278700002402304700002402328700002402352700002202376773011902398856007702517852000902594655001202603IND60729237220221121050111.0210228e20210203xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072923722DNAL7 a10.3390/foods100203122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMorales, Eduardo 10aEffect of Interfacial Ionic Layers on the Food-Grade O/W Emulsion Physical Stability and Astaxanthin Retention during Spray-Drying  aNAL-light  aThe utilization of astaxanthin in food processing is considered to be narrow because of its substandard solubility in aqueous matrices and the instability of chemical compounds during the processing of food and the instability of chemical compounds during the processing of food. The investigation sought to evaluate multilayer emulsions stabilized by ionic interfacial layers of lupin protein isolate (LPI), ι-carrageenan (CA), and chitosan (CHI) on the physical stability of the emulsion as well as the retention of astaxanthin during the spray drying process. Primary emulsion (Pr-E) was prepared by adding LPI on oil droplet surfaces containing astaxanthin. The homogenization pressure and cycles to obtain the Pr-E were investigated. The secondary emulsion (Se-E) and tertiary emulsion (Te-E) were elaborated by mixing CA/Pr-E and CHI/Se-E, respectively. Emulsion stability was assessed under different environmental stresses (pH and NaCl). Astaxanthin retention of emulsions was determined immediately after finishing the spray-drying process. The results showed that Pr-E was stabilized with 1.0% (w/v) of LPI at 50 MPa and three cycles. Se-E and Te-E were obtained with CA/Pr-E and Se-E/CHI of 70/30 and 50/50% (w/w), respectively. The Se-E was the most stable compared to the Pr-E and Te-E when subjected to different pHs; nevertheless, once the NaCl concentration rose, no variations in the ζ-potential of all emulsions studied or destabilization were observed. The Se-E and Te-E derived provided higher astaxanthin retention (>95%) during the spray-drying process compared to Pr-E (around 88%). The results indicated that these astaxanthin multilayer emulsions show considerable potential as a functional ingredient in food products.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLupinus 3aastaxanthin 3achitosan 3adroplets 3aemulsions 3ahomogenization 3aingredients 3aoils 3apH 3apressure 3aprotein isolates 3asolubility 3aspray drying1 aBurgos-Díaz, César 1 aZúñiga, Rommy  N.1 aJorkowski, Johanna 1 aQuilaqueo, Marcela 1 aRubilar, Mónica 0 tFoods.g2021 Feb. 03, v. 10, no. 2dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21651x2304-81587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/foods100203123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03194naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002300150245012900173300001600302500001500318520183200333592002802165650002802193650001902221650001602240650001502256650001902271650001202290650001002302650002002312651001102332653002502343653002402368653001702392653002002409653002602429653002002455653002102475700002302496700002802519773010702547856008502654852000902739655001202748IND50066036920221119174412.0190215e201304  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006603692DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biocon.2013.01.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchmidt, Joshua H.10aAccounting for incomplete detection: What are we estimating and how might it affect long-term passerine monitoring programs?  ap. 130-139.  a2019-12-06  aA primary objective of ecological monitoring programs typically includes the efficient detection of population trends. Passerines as a group are important ecological indicators and are often included in such programs to provide information on multiple species with a single survey technique. However, commonly used field and analytical approaches may not provide appropriate inference or sensitivity due to assumption violations and differences in the proportion of the population exposed to sampling. Recent methodological developments utilizing repeated point counts and an N-mixture modeling approach for analysis may produce more consistent and interpretable estimates applicable to the superpopulation of individuals using a site during the breeding season. These estimates should be more useful for monitoring because they are not conditioned on presence or availability as are most single-visit approaches. We used repeated count data collected in Denali National Park and Preserve, Alaska (Denali) between 1995 and 2009 from 12 common passerine species to assess variation in presence and availability throughout the season, estimate trends in superpopulation abundance, and provide recommendations for the design of future monitoring programs. We found that variation in detection due to presence and availability was large and differed among species. After accounting for these sources of variation, we estimated abundance of Wilson’s warblers (Wilsonia pusilla) had declined by approximately 48% and fox sparrow (Passerella iliaca) abundance had increased by approximately 250% over 15years. Combined, our results suggest that if trend estimation is a priority, passerine monitoring programs should formally address all components of the detection process, including the probabilities of presence and availability.  aPublisher supplied data 3ainterspecific variation 3anational parks 3aprobability 3amonitoring 3abreeding sites 3asurveys 3afoxes 3abreeding season 3aAlaska 0aLong-term monitoring 0aspecies differences 0aAvailability 0aSuperpopulation 0aDetection probability 0aRepeated counts 0aPopulation trend1 aMcIntyre, Carol L.1 aMacCluskie, Margaret C.0 tBiological conservation.g2013 Apr., v. 160 p.130-139dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl44607x0006-32077nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biocon.2013.01.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02578naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245004400168300001600212520135100228592002801579650002101607650002301628650002201651650002501673650001901698650001001717650002001727650003001747650001201777650001201789650001401801650001101815650001801826653002901844653001301873653001401886653001701900653001201917773012301929856008302052852000902135655001202144IND60113404020221118020743.0190412e201304  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011340402DNAL7 a10.1053/j.jepm.2013.05.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrust, David M.10aGastrointestinal Diseases of Marsupials  ap. 132-140.  aThis article focuses on gastrointestinal diseases that affect 3 of the most common marsupials treated by veterinarians: the red kangaroo (Macropus rufus), Bennett’s wallaby (Macropus rufogriseus), and the sugar glider (Petaurus breviceps). Other marsupial species maintained in captivity include the eastern gray kangaroo (Macropus gigantus), the tammar wallaby (Macropus eugenii), and the wallaroo (Macropus robustus). Most all of the disease conditions discussed in this article are also diagnosed in the lesser species listed earlier. Marsupials derive their name from the presence of the marsupial bones (ossa marsupialia), which serve as the surface for the attachment of several abdominal muscles. The ossa marsupialia were once thought to support the marsupium (pouch), although this was an incorrect assumption. The metabolic rate of marsupials is generally considered to be approximately two-thirds that of eutherian or placental mammals. Marsupials belong to a unique group of animals whose development is characterized by a very short gestation, the birth of relatively underdeveloped young (joeys), and a lengthy period of lactational development that typically occurs in a pouch. The physiologic differences that exist between marsupials and eutherian mammals should be considered when managing disease conditions in these animals.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMacropus eugenii 3aMacropus giganteus 3aMacropus robustus 3aMacropus rufogriseus 3aMacropus rufus 3abones 3acaptive animals 3adigestive system diseases 3amammals 3amuscles 3apregnancy 3asugars 3aveterinarians 0agastrointestinal disease 0akangaroo 0amarsupial 0asugar glider 0awallaby0 tJournal of exotic pet medicine.g2013 Apr., v. 22, no. 2 p.132-140dElsevier Inc.wJournal:J000000103x1557-50637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1053/j.jepm.2013.05.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03125naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100006100155245009900216300001600315520177700331592002802108650001002136650002302146650001202169650003502181650001402216650001502230650002302245650001502268650001302283653002802296653002202324653002202346653002002368653003402388700002302422700001802445700001902463700001902482773009102501856009002592852000902682655001202691IND60597921020221119164946.0190613e201810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059792102DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2018.05.1682doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchmidt, Stine N.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6511-778510aLinking algal growth inhibition to chemical activity: Excess toxicity below 0.1% of saturation  ap. 880-886.  aChemical activity quantifies the energetic level of an organic compound relative to its pure liquid [0–1], and several studies have reported that baseline toxicity generally requires chemical activities of 0.01–0.1. The first aim was to challenge this chemical activity range for baseline toxicity. Algal growth inhibition data (median effective concentrations, EC50) were compiled from two recent studies and included 108 compounds categorised as non-polar (mode of toxic action, MOA1) and polar (MOA2) narcotics. These data were linked to chemical activity by (1) plotting them relative to a regression for (subcooled) liquid solubility (SL), which served as visual reference for chemical activity of unity and (2) determining EC50/SL ratios that essentially equal median effective chemical activity (Ea50). Growth inhibition required chemical activity >0.01 for MOA1 and >0.001 for MOA2 compounds. The second aim was to identify compounds exerting excess toxicity, i.e., when growth inhibition occurred at chemical activity <0.001. From a recent review with 2323 data entries, 315 EC50 values passed our selection criteria. 280 of these EC50 values were within or near the baseline toxicity range (Ea50>0.001), and 25 compounds were found to exert excess toxicity (Ea50<0.001). Of these compounds, 16 are pesticides or precursors. Methodologically, this study includes two methods for translating EC50 values into the chemical activity framework, each having advantages and limitations. Scientifically, this study confirms that baseline toxicity generally requires chemical activities of 0.01–0.1 and extends the application of the chemical activity approach beyond baseline toxicity, by demonstrating its utility to identify compounds that exert excess toxicity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgae 3agrowth retardation 3aliquids 3amedian effective concentration 3anarcotics 3apesticides 3aselection criteria 3asolubility 3atoxicity 0aAlgal growth inhibition 0aChemical activity 0aBaseline toxicity 0aExcess toxicity 0aEnvironmental risk assessment1 aArmitage, James M.1 aArnot, Jon A.1 aMackay, Donald1 aMayer, Philipp0 tChemosphere.g2018 Oct., v. 208 p.880-886dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2018.05.1683Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01808naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004400092040001800136100002400154245007900178300001600257500002000273520062200293592002800915650003000943650002200973650002500995650002401020650001001044650001701054650002001071650001201091650002701103650001901130650001601149651001101165700002801176773011801204852000901322856009101331655001201422IND2050295320221122225054.0210418e199406  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205029532DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1469-8137.1994.tb04289.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLEV‐YADUN, SIMCHA10aLate Epipalaeolithic wood remains from el‐Wad Cave, Mount Carmel, Israel  ap. 391-396.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThirty‐two Early Natufian (13‐11 k years BP) pieces of charcoal were found in the recent excavations of el‐Wad Cave, Mount Carmel, Israel.

However, crop-based biofuels compete with food production and should be avoided. Microalgal cultivation for biofuel production offers an alternative to crops and can become economically viable when combined with the use of used water resources. Besides nutrients and water, harvesting microalgal biomass represents one of the major costs related to biofuel production and thus efficient and cheap solutions are needed. In bacterial-algal systems, there is the potential to produce energy by co-digesting the two types of biomass. We present an innovative approach to recover microalgal biomass via a two-step flocculation using bacterial biomass after the destabilisation of microalgae with conventional cationic polymer. A short solids retention time (SRT) enhanced biological phosphorus removal (EBPR) system was combined with microalgal cultivation. Two different bacterial biomass removal strategies were assessed whereby bacterial biomass was collected from the solid-liquid separation after the anaerobic phase and after the aerobic phase. Microalgal recovery was tested by jar tests where three different chemical coagulants in coagulation-flocculation tests (AlCl3, PDADMAC and Greenfloc 120) were assessed. Furthermore, jar tests were conducted to assess the microalgal biomass recovery by a two-step flocculation method, involving chemical coagulants in the first step and bacterial biomass used in the second step to enhance the flocculation. Up to 97% of the microalgal biomass was recovered using 16mg polymer/g algae and 0.1g algae/g bacterial biomass. Moreover, the energy recovery by the short-SRT EBPR system combined with microalgal cultivation was assessed via biomethane potential tests. Up to 560±24mLCH4/gVS methane yield was obtained by co-digesting bacterial biomass collected after the anaerobic phase and microalgal biomass. The energy recovery in terms of methane production obtained in the short-SRT EBPR system is about 40% of the influent chemical energy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaluminum chloride 3aanaerobic digestion 3abiogas 3acoagulants 3acrops 3aeconomic sustainability 3aenergy 3aenergy recovery 3aflocculation 3afood production 3afuel production 3aharvesting 3amethane production 3amicroalgae 3amicrobial biomass 3anutrients 3aphosphorus 3apolymers 3asludge 3awater resources 0aGreen microalgae 0aEnhanced biological phosphorus removal 0aBioflocculation 0aCo-digestion 0aEnergy recovery1 aRadovici, Maria1 aSmets, Barth F.1 aAngelidaki, I.,1 aValverde-Pérez, Borja1 aPlósz, Benedek Gy.0 tAlgal research.g2016 Dec., v. 20 p.197-204dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12360x2211-92647nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.algal.2016.10.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04583naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100007000147245017500217520230500392592002802697650002902725650000802754650002002762650003102782650001602813650001802829650001502847650003802862650001302900650001702913650001902930650001602949650001902965650001902984650002003003650002503023650001703048651001103065653002103076653003303097653003303130653002503163653001403188700007003202700002903272700002703301700003003328700003303358700002703391700003403418700003803452700007803490700003503568700002703603700003703630700007103667773011603738856008203854852000903936655001203945IND60754617220221118063538.0211213e20220210xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075461722DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jep.2021.1147572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSilva, Girlaine Pereira da1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8945-741510aEchinodorus macrophyllus: Hydroxycinnamoyl derivatives reduces neutrophil migration through modulation of cytokines, chemokines, and prostaglandin in the air-pouch model.  aIn Brazil, Echinodorus macrophyllus (Alismataceae), popularly known as chapéu-de-couro, is used to treat inflammatory diseases. Previous studies have shown a significant decrease in the acute inflammation for the aqueous extract of E. macrophyllus (AEEm) and its ethanolic fraction (Fr20).This work fractionated Fr20, identified the fraction and substances responsible for the in vivo anti-inflammatory property, and demonstrated important immunomodulatory mechanisms of action.Fr20 was fractionated using Sephadex LH-20, and the most active fraction was chromatographically analyzed (HPLC-DAD and UPLC-ESI-TOF-MS). Leukotriene B4, Prostaglandin E2, and cytokines were determined by the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and in vivo acute inflammation by the air pouch model.The subfractions SF1, SF3, and mainly the SF4 decreased NO levels (p < 0.05). SF3 and SF4 showed high DPPH scavenger activity. SF1 was more effective than SF4 in reducing vasodilation, redness, and leukocyte migration into the 4-h air pouch. SF1 inhibited 90.5% (100 mg/kg) and SF4 54.0% (50 mg/kg), mainly affecting the number of neutrophils. SF1 and SF4 reduced the protein level in the exudate. SF1 was also more effective in inhibiting neutrophil migration in a transwell assay (46.3%) and reduced (86.1%) the Leukotriene B4 level in the exudate. After five days of treatment, some SF1 anti-inflammatory mechanisms were evaluated in the air pouch's 24 h exudate and tissue. Despite the high level of inflammation of the control group in this condition, SF1 confirmed the decrease in the protein level and neutrophils migration into the pouch. It decreased the number of bone marrow cells, indicating a systemic effect of SF1. SF1 also decreased TNF-α (87%), IL-1β (77%), CKCL1/KC (71.3%), and PGE2 (97.8%) and increased IL-10 (74.1%) levels in the air pouch exudate. Phytochemical analysis of SF1 indicates mainly hydroxycinnamoyl derivatives.Hydroxycinnamoyl derivatives present in SF1 are related to the crucial anti-inflammatory mechanisms of E. macrophyllus, decreasing the levels of TNF-α, IL-1β, CKCL1/KC, LTB4, and PGE2 on the exudate. These results explain the reduction of vasodilatation, erythema, and neutrophil migration into the air pouch model, confirming this plant's anti-inflammatory potential.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEchinodorus macrophyllus 3aair 3aair pouch model 3aanti-inflammatory activity 3abone marrow 3acell movement 3achemokines 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3aerythema 3ainflammation 3ainterleukin-10 3aneutrophils 3aphytochemicals 3aprostaglandins 3aprotein content 3atraditional medicine 3avasodilation 3aBrazil 0aMedicinal plants 0aHydroxycinnamoyl derivatives 0aAnti-inflammatory mechanisms 0aRAW 264.7 macrophage 0aCytokines1 aFernandes, Daniele Corrêa1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5379-624X1 aVigliano, Mariana Vieira1 aPinto, Fabiana Araújo1 aFonseca, Eduardo Nunes da1 aSantos, Shirley Vânia Moura1 aMarques, Paulo Roberto1 aGayer, Carlos Roberto Machado1 aVelozo, Leosvaldo Salazar Marques1 aLima, Cleverton Kleiton Freitas de1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3598-943X1 aPalhares de Miranda, Ana Luisa1 aJusto, Maria da Graça1 aSabino, Kátia Costa de Carvalho1 aCoelho, Marsen Garcia Pinto1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8945-74150 tJournal of ethnopharmacology.g2022 Feb. 10, v. 284 p.114757-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl30651x0378-87417nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jep.2021.1147573Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02117naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100006000152245009900212506010400311506007600415520071000491592002801201506003701229650001101266650001101277650001701288650001201305650002501317653003501342653003301377653002701410700002401437700002501461700006301486773009801549856008701647852000901734655001201743IND60776052820221207075643.0220531e20220715xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077605282DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apenergy.2022.1191862doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHennig, Roman J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9294-158210aWhat is a good distribution network tariff?—Developing indicators for performance assessment  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe adoption of distributed energy resources such as PV cells, electric vehicles and batteries in electric grids is increasing steadily. This brings new challenges for distribution networks. The current network tariffs were not designed for these types of usage and, in many cases, they are not adequate anymore. Thus, many new tariff frameworks have been proposed. In this paper, we focus on the question of how to assess whether a given tariff framework fulfills its objectives. We propose to use quantitative indicators for performance assessment. We give examples of indicators for common objectives and demonstrate how they can be derived from a cost-accounting methodology for distribution networks.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3adesign 3aenergy 3asolar energy 3atariffs 3avehicles (equipment) 0aElectric distribution networks 0aDistributed energy resources 0aPerformance assessment1 aRibó-Pérez, David1 ade Vries, Laurens J.1 aTindemans, Simon H.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8369-75680 tApplied energy.g2022 July 15, v. 318 p.119186-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11876x0306-26197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2022.1191863Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03980naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245006900172300001800241520254100259536009802800592002802898650001202926650001902938650002502957650002502982650001703007650001303024650001003037650002503047650001103072650001303083650001303096651002003109653003003129653003403159653002803193653002703221653003303248653001503281700002103296773011003317856008603427852000903513655001203522IND60755594520221119042341.0211203e20211021xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075559452DNAL7 a10.1080/14693062.2021.19799272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChristoff, Peter10aConvergent evolution: framework climate legislation in Australia  ap. 1190-1204.  aAustralia is a well-known climate laggard with a history of political conflict over climate policy and the dubious distinction of being the only country to repeal a national emissions trading scheme (ETS). This article examines the puzzle of why four subnational governments in Australia’s federation succeeded in enacting durable framework climate legislation based on a model that came to be widely regarded as ‘best-practice’. We show that in 2007 South Australia was the first jurisdiction in the world to enact framework climate legislation with a 2050 emissions reduction target and an independent expert advisory committee to provide guidance on the implementation of interim targets. We show that this local legislative innovation set off a process of political learning, policy transfer and a virtuous political competition among like-minded Labour and Labour-Green governments at the subnational level. We call this ‘convergent evolution’ insofar as the legislative innovation and diffusion over the period 2007–2015 was similar to, but occurred independently of, the UK Climate Change Act 2008 and the diffusion of this model elsewhere in Europe. Common to all cases was a strong commitment by the premier and/or the relevant minister to pursue a decarbonisation strategy via targets, and reliance on sources of advice for legislative reform that were professionally and/or politically committed to climate action rather than from vested industry groups. More generally, we argue that framework climate legislation carries lower political risks than an ETS because it does not draw attention to the upfront costs of action. The diffusion of subnational climate change legislation, accompanied by renewable energy promotion, has helped to limit the impacts of Australian national climate policy failure while also providing a springboard for renewed climate legislative momentum at the national level. Key Policy Insights Similar innovations in climate policy and legislation can occur independently in different regions in response to similar global pressures. Framework climate legislation based on long-term and progressive interim targets carries lower political risks than an ETS because it does not draw as much attention to the upfront costs of action. Innovation in subnational framework climate legislation in a federation can generate a virtuous competition in target setting and renewable energy promotion in states that are not heavily dependent on fossil fuels or close to retiring fossil fuel assets.  aThe author(s) reported there is no funding associated with the work featured in this article.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3aconvergent evolution 3aenvironmental policy 3afossil fuels 3aindustry 3alabor 3alaws and regulations 3amodels 3amomentum 3apolitics 3aSouth Australia 0aAustralian climate policy 0aframework climate legislation 0aclimate policy learning 0atransfer and diffusion 0aClimate Change Act 2008 (UK) 0afederalism1 aEckersley, Robyn0 tClimate policy.g2021 Oct. 21, v. 21, no. 9 p.1190-1204dTaylor & FranciswJournal:19684x1752-74577nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14693062.2021.19799273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02643naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245006400165500002200229520123500251592002801486650000801514650001201522650002301534650002001557650001001577650001101587650002501598650002301623650002801646650001601674650001701690650002901707650002601736700001601762700001501778700001701793700001501810700001301825700001601838700001701854700001401871700001301885700001601898700001701914773011501931856008202046852000902128655001202137IND60617571120221119170335.0181025s2018    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061757112DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbrc.2018.10.0562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Yangyang10aStructural basis for multiple gene regulation by human DUX4  aPre-press version  aDUX4 plays critical role in the molecular pathogenesis of the neuromuscular disorder facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy and acute lymphoblastic leukemia in humans. As a master transcription regulator, DUX4 can also bind the promoters and activate the transcription of hundreds ZGA-associated genes. Here we report on the structural and biochemical studies of DUX4 double homeodomains (DUX4-DH), representing the only structures contain both homeodomain 1 (HD1) and homeodomain 2 (HD2). HD1 and HD2 adopt classical homeobox fold; via the helix inserted into the major groove and the N-terminal extended loop inserted into the minor groove, HD1 and HD2 recognize the box1 (5′-TAA-3′) and box2 (5′-TGA-3′) nucleotides of the consensus sequence, respectively. Among the box1 and box2 linking nucleotides (CCTAA), the two adenine residues are reported to be highly conserved; however, they are not directly recognized by DUX4-DH in the structures. Besides different nucleotides, our ITC analysis indicated that DUX4-DH can also tolerate various changes in the linker length. Our studies not only revealed the basis for target DNA recognition by DUX4, but also advanced our understanding on multiple gene activation by DUX4.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aadenine 3aconsensus sequence 3agene activation 3agenes 3ahumans 3alymphocytic leukemia 3amuscular dystrophy 3aneuromuscular disorders 3anucleotides 3apathogenesis 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranscription factors1 aWu, Baixing1 aLiu, Hehua1 aGao, Yanqing1 aYang, Chun1 aChen, Xi1 aZhang, Jing1 aChen, Yiqing1 aGu, Yijun1 aLi, Jixi1 aMa, Jinbiao1 aGan, Jianhua0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2018, dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl46848x0006-291X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2018.10.0563Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02667naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001800143245011600161500001400277520148300291592002801774650001401802650001201816650001301828650001401841650001801855650001101873650001201884650001601896650001201912650001701924650001301941650001401954700002201968700002101990700002202011700001902033773011902052856007702171852000902248655001202257IND60729237520221121075334.0210228e20210203xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072923752DNAL7 a10.3390/foods100203232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aArai, Nayuta 10aSoft Mango Firmness Assessment Based on Rayleigh Waves Generated by a Laser-Induced Plasma Shock Wave Technique  aNAL-light  aMany methods based on acoustic vibration characteristics have been studied to indirectly assess fruit ripeness via fruit firmness. Among these, the frequency of the ₀S₂ vibration mode measured on the equator has been examined, but soft-flesh fruit do not show the ₀S₂ vibration mode. In this study, a Rayleigh wave is generated on a soft mango fruit using the impulse excitation force generated by a laser-induced plasma shock wave technique. Then, the flesh firmness of mangoes is assessed in a non-contact and non-destructive manner by observing the Rayleigh wave propagation velocity because it is correlated with the firmness (shear elasticity), density, and Poisson’s ratio of an object. If the changes in the density and Poisson’s ratio are small enough to be ignored during storage, then the Rayleigh wave propagation velocity is strongly correlated to fruit firmness. Here, we measure the Rayleigh wave propagation velocity and investigate the effect of storage time. Specifically, we investigate the changes in firmness caused by ripening. The Rayleigh wave propagation velocity on the equator of Kent mangoes tended to decrease by over 4% in 96 h. The Rayleigh wave measured on two different lines propagated independent distance and showed a different change rate of propagation velocity during 96-h storage. Furthermore, we consider the reliability of our method by investigating the interaction of a mango seed on the Rayleigh wave propagation velocity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacoustics 3adensity 3afirmness 3afrequency 3afruit quality 3afruits 3amangoes 3areliability 3astorage 3astorage time 3avelocity 3avibration1 aMiyake, Masafumi 1 aYamamoto, Kengo 1 aKajiwara, Itsuro 1 aHosoya, Naoki 0 tFoods.g2021 Feb. 03, v. 10, no. 2dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21651x2304-81587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/foods100203233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02483naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002400151245018100175520120300356592002801559650001201587650002301599650002001622650001601642650001901658653002401677653003101701653000801732653000701740653003601747700002001783700001901803700001601822700002101838700001901859700001901878773009301897856008601990852000902076655001202085IND60736134820221122231430.0220207e202104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073613482DNAL7 a10.1016/j.heliyon.2021.e065932doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSharmila Tagore, S.10aCrystallographic investigation, Hirshfeld surface analysis, NLO characterization and experimental spectral (UV and NMR) studies with DFT probe on(R)-9-(2-hydroxy propyl)adenine  aIn this study, (R)-9-(2-hydroxy propyl)adenine (HPA) is the molecule of interest for investigation. The XRD from single crystal of HPA has been used to extract its structural features. Since HPA crystallised in a non-centro symmetric space group P2₁2₁2₁, its NLO property was studied and it was found to exhibit very good SHG activity. To explore the intermolecular interactions the generated Hirshfeld surface has been investigated along with 2D-fingerprint plots. The experimental electronic and NMR spectra taken in the UV-visible and radio frequency regions respectively for HPA have been corroborated in correlation with theoretical predictions at Density Function Theory using 6-311++g (d, p) basis set. The experimental XRD geometrical parameters, chemical shifts of ¹³C and ¹H and λₘₐₓ values of HPA fit satisfactorily with the corresponding theoretically obtained numerical values as well as the stimulated spectrograms with the experimental ones. Further to explore the electronic structure, the MESP surface has been generated and investigated. The thermodynamic, kinetic and chemical reactivity features have been explored by means of frontier molecular orbitals of HPA.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadenine 3achemical reactions 3acrystallography 3aradio waves 3athermodynamics 0aStructural analysis 0aHirshfeld surface analysis 0aNMR 0aUV 0a(R)-9-(2-hydroxy propyl)adenine1 aSwaminathan, J.1 aManikandan, D.1 aGomathi, S.1 aSabarinathan, N.1 aRamalingam, M.1 aSethuraman, V.0 tHeliyon.g2021 Apr., v. 7, no. 4 p.e06593-dElsevier LtdwJournal:23264x2405-84407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2021.e065933Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03936naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002400139245018500163300001800348520262200366592002802988650004503016650002003061650002203081650001103103650002403114650001503138650001203153650001603165650001503181650001703196650002603213650002103239651001803260700002203278700001903300700002203319773010303341856007303444852000903517655001203526IND60435921020221118183451.0151020e201511  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6043592102DNAL7 a10.1111/jvs.123272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aReisner, Michael D.10aStress‐gradient hypothesis explains susceptibility to Bromus tectorum invasion and community stability in North America's semi‐arid Artemisia tridentata wyomingensis ecosystems  ap. 1212-1224.  aQUESTIONS: (1) What combinations of overlapping water and heat stress and herbivory disturbance gradients are associated with shifts in interactions between Artemisia tridentata subsp. wyomingensis (Artemisia) and herbaceous beneficiary species? (2) Do interactions between Artemisia and beneficiaries shift from competition to facilitation with increasing stress‐disturbance where facilitation and competition are most frequent and strongest at the highest and lowest levels, respectively? (3) Do such relationships differ for native and non‐native beneficiaries? (4) What are the implications of any observed shifts in interactions between community compositional stability in space and susceptibility to invasion? LOCATION: North American Artemisia communities. METHODS: We tested the stress‐gradient hypothesis (SGH) in an observational study consisting of 75 sites located along overlapping water and heat stress and disturbance gradients. We used spatial patterns of association among Artemisia and six native and two non‐native beneficiary species; including the invasive annual grass Bromus tectorum, representing a diverse array of life history strategies, to infer whether the net outcome of interactions was facilitation or competition. We assessed implications for community stability by examining shifts in community composition in space and resistance to invasion. RESULTS/CONCLUSIONS: Cattle herbivory, a novel disturbance and selective force, was a significant component of two overlapping stress gradients most strongly associated with observed shifts in interactions. Facilitation and competition were strongest and most frequent at the highest and lowest stress levels along both gradients, respectively. Contrasting ecological optima among native and non‐native beneficiaries led to strikingly different patterns of interactions. The four native bunchgrasses with the strongest competitive response abilities exhibited the strongest facilitation at their upper limits of stress tolerance, while the two non‐natives exhibited the strongest competition at the highest stress levels, which coincided with their maximum abundance. Artemisia facilitation enhanced stability at intermediate stress levels by providing a refuge for native bunchgrasses, which in turn reduced the magnitude of B. tectorum invasion. However, facilitation was a destabilizing force at the highest stress levels when native bunchgrasses became obligate beneficiaries dependent on facilitation for their persistence. B. tectorum dominated these communities, and the next fire may convert them to annual grasslands.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArtemisia tridentata subsp. wyomingensis 3aBromus tectorum 3aannual grasslands 3acattle 3acommunity structure 3aecosystems 3agrasses 3aheat stress 3aherbivores 3alife history 3aobservational studies 3astress tolerance 3aNorth America1 aDoescher, Paul S.1 aPyke, David A.1 aMichalet, Richard0 tJournal of vegetation science.g2015 Nov., v. 26, no. 6 p.1212-1224dOpulus Pressx1100-92337nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jvs.123273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02921naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100002300141245013100164520137400295592002801669650002101697650001701718650002801735650001501763650001301778650001301791650002801804650002601832650001301858650001501871650003201886650001301918650001501931650002901946650004001975650001602015700002502031700002002056700002502076700002502101700002002126700002302146700002602169700002502195773012202220856007602342852000902418655001202427IND60794097220221121052739.0220922e20220913xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079409722DNAL7 a10.3390/ani121823922doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMangiaterra, Sara 10aEvaluation of the Fecal Proteome in Healthy and Diseased Cheetahs (Acinonyx jubatus) Suffering from Gastrointestinal Disorders  aFecal proteomics allows for the identification of proteins and peptides present in stools and is useful in finding possible new biomarkers for diagnosing and/or monitoring gastrointestinal (GI) disorders. In the present study, we investigated the fecal proteome in healthy and diseased cheetahs (Acinonyx jubatus). Captive individuals of this species frequently show gastrointestinal disorders characterized by recurrent episodes of diarrhea, rare episodes of vomiting and weight loss, associated with Helicobacter spp. infection. Fecal proteomic evaluation has been performed by two-dimensional electrophoresis followed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. In healthy cheetahs, the results showed the presence of the following proteins: collagen alpha-1 (II) chain, transthyretin, IgG Fc-binding protein, titin, dystonin, isopentenyl-diphosphate Delta-isomerase 1, sodium/potassium-transporting ATPase subunit alpha-1 and protein disulfide-isomerase A6. The presence of albumin isoforms was found only in diseased cheetahs. The present paper reports the study of the fecal proteome in the cheetah, evidences some differences between healthy and diseased patients and confirms, once again, the potential of fecal proteomics for the study of the GI environment, with promising developments regarding the identification of new diagnostic/monitoring markers.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcinonyx jubatus 3aHelicobacter 3aadenosinetriphosphatase 3abiomarkers 3acollagen 3adiarrhea 3agastrointestinal system 3aliquid chromatography 3apeptides 3aprealbumin 3aprotein disulfide-isomerase 3aproteome 3aproteomics 3atandem mass spectrometry 3atwo-dimensional gel electrophoresis 3aweight loss1 aVincenzetti, Silvia 1 aRossi, Giacomo 1 aMarchegiani, Andrea 1 aGavazza, Alessandra 1 aPetit, Thierry 1 aSagratini, Gianni 1 aRicciutelli, Massimo 1 aCerquetella, Matteo 0 tAnimals.g2022 Sept. 13, v. 12, no. 18dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2274x2076-26157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ani121823923Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01671naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245010500171300001600276520063200292592002800924650001900952650001000971651002100981651001001002653001301012653001301025653001601038653002601054700002101080700002401101700001901125773008401144856008401228852000901312655001201321IND60123254920221118190107.0150325e20140102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012325492DNAL7 a10.1080/00837792.2014.9133812doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJoshī, Yogeśa,12aA note on the occurrence of Xanthoparmelia saxeti (Stizenb.)

By exploiting Pontryagin’s minimum principle, we show that the energy supply required to obtain a certain change in the state of charge (SOC) of the battery can be approximated using a quadratic equation. The parameters of these mappings depend on the power request imposed by the driving mission and thus allow to compress the time-resolved power profile into only three scalar variables. Having a driving mission divided into several segments of arbitrary length, the corresponding sequence of quadratic approximations allows to reformulate the original energy management problem as a quadratic program, which offers an efficient way to include a large number of future scenarios. The resulting scenario-based stochastic MPC approach prevents SOC boundary violations with a certain probability, which can be controlled by the number of scenarios considered. To validate the quadratic approximation, we study two numerical examples using two different vehicles, a series hybrid electric passenger car and a battery-assisted trolley bus. Finally, a case study based on the operation of the latter is provided, which demonstrates the expected behavior and the real-time capability of the stochastic MPC approach. While the SOC is maintained in predefined boundaries with high probability, the required energy supply is only increased by 1.41% compared to the non-causal optimum.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aautomobiles 3abatteries 3acase studies 3aenergy 3aequations 3aprediction 3aquadratic programming 3astochastic processes 3auncertainty 0aHybrid electric vehicles 0aEnergy management system 0aModel predictive control 0aScenario optimization1 aWidmer, Fabio1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0604-38561 aDuhr, Pol1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7708-98461 aOnder, Christopher H.0 tApplied energy.g2022 Sept. 15, v. 322 p.119192-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11876x0306-26197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2022.1191923Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02825naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004400092040001800136100002400154245013200178300001600310500002000326520174700346592002802093650002002121650001602141650001402157650002402171650002902195650001202224650002502236700002002261773011802281852000902399856009102408655001202499IND2050320020221122221025.0210418e199410  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205032002DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1469-8137.1994.tb04005.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSHUMWAY, DURLAND L.10aReproductive responses to mycorrhizal colonization of Abutilon theophrasti Medic, plants grown for two generations in the field  ap. 219-224.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aPlants of Abutilo theophrasti Medic, were grown for two consecutive years in the field. First generation (maternal) plants were grown either with or without mycorrhizal inoculation with Glomus intraradices Schenck & Smith. We collected early and late cohorts of seeds which were used to product second generation (offspring) plants. Offspring plants were grown either with or without mycorrhizal inoculation with G. intraradices. Irrespective of maternal mycorrhizal status, we found that offspring of early cohort seeds had greater percent mycorrhizal colonization early in the growing season, a greater proportion of plants flowering early in the season, and a greater number of capsules per plant at the end of the season compared with offspring of late cohort seeds. These differences were observed despite the fact that shoot N and P concentrations were greater in offspring of late cohort seeds. We found that mycorrhizal colonization of maternal plants decreased the average time to reproductive maturity in offspring plants, but did not significantly influence any other vegetative or reproductive trait in the offspring plants. Mycorrhizal colonization of offspring plants resulted in a greater number of branches per plant and a greater number of mature capsules per branch. Mycorrhizal colonization of offspring plants also resulted in a significant increase in seed P content, bur only for seeds that were produced late in the growing season, We conclude that mycorrhizal colonization of the offspring generation was more important than mycorrhizal colonization of the maternal generation m determining offspring reproductive output, but maternal seed cohort is an important interacting factor that influences offspring fecundity.  aPublisher supplied data 3amaternal effect 3amycorrhizae 3aflowering 3asexual reproduction 3aRhizophagus intraradices 3aprogeny 3aAbutilon theophrasti1 aKOIDE, ROGER T.0 tnew phytologist.g1994 Oct., v. 128, no. 2 p.219-224dBlackwell Publishing LtdwJournal:jnl44665x0028-646X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1469-8137.1994.tb04005.x3Available from publisher's site 7aarticle03261naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245015200168300001800320520137500338536029901713592002802012596006902040596009602109596007502205650001902280650002402299650001102323650001902334650002402353650002102377650001202398651001002410653002502420653002002445653001802465653002702483700001802510700001502528700001602543700001402559773013502573856008602708852000902794655001202803IND60755594820221119042228.0211104e20211102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075559482DNAL7 a10.1080/17538947.2021.19466052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShi, Kaifang10aCarbon dioxide (CO₂) emissions from the service industry, traffic, and secondary industry as revealed by the remotely sensed nighttime light data  ap. 1514-1527.  aExploring carbon dioxide (CO₂) emissions from human activities is essential for urban energy conservation and resource management. Remotely sensed nighttime lights from the Suomi NPP-VIIRS provide spatial consistency in and a low-cost way of revealing CO₂ emissions. Although many researches have documented the feasibility of the Suomi NPP-VIIRS data for assessing CO₂ emissions, few have systematically revealed the ability of nighttime lights for evaluating CO₂ emissions from different industries, such as service industry CO₂ emissions (SC), traffic CO₂ emissions (TC), and secondary industry CO₂ emissions (IC). Here, China was selected as the experimental subject, and we comprehensively explored the relationships between the nighttime lights and SC, TC, and IC, and investigated the factors mediating these relationships. We found that without considering other factors, the nighttime lights only revealed up to 51.2% of TC, followed by 41.7% of IC and 22.7% of SC. When controlling for city characteristic variables, the models showed that there were positive correlations between the Suomi NPP-VIIRS data and SC, IC, and TC, and that nighttime lights have an Inverted-U relationship with SC. The Suomi NPP-VIIRS data are more suitable for revealing SC, TC, and IC in medium-sized and large-sized cities than in small-sized cities and megacities.  aThis study has been supported by the Key Research Program of Frontier Sciences, CAS (No. QYZDB-SSW-DQC011), the MOE (Ministry of Education in China) Project of Humanities and Social Sciences (No. 18XJC790011), and the Fundamental Research Founds for the Central Universities (No. XDJK2020B008).  aPublisher supplied data  aQYZDB-SSW-DQC011cKey Research Program of Frontier Sciences, CAS  a18XJC790011cMOE (Ministry of Education in China) Project of Humanities and Social Sciences  aXDJK2020B008cFundamental Research Founds for the Central Universities 3acarbon dioxide 3aenergy conservation 3ahumans 3aremote sensing 3aresource management 3aservice industry 3atraffic 3aChina 0aNighttime light data 0aSuomi NPP-VIIRS 0aCO2 emissions 0atransmission mechanism1 aShen, Jingwei1 aWu, Yizhen1 aLiu, Shirao1 aLi, Linyi0 tInternational journal of digital earth.g2021 Nov. 02, v. 14, no. 11 p.1514-1527dTaylor & FranciswJournal:12290x1753-89557nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/17538947.2021.19466053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02989naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002200152245010500174520179200279592002802071650001802099650001402117650001102131650001502142650001202157651001502169653002002184653003502204653003402239653002802273653002502301700002402326700002202350700002302372700001402395773009802409856008702507852000902594655001202603IND60776053320221116194407.0220531e20220715xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077605332DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apenergy.2022.1191942doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlipour, Mohammad10aHow the decision to accept or reject PV affects the behaviour of residential battery system adopters  aWhen residential rooftop solar photovoltaic (PV) systems are widely accepted across society, the uptake of home battery energy storage systems is closely tied to the PV-status quo and the behaviour previously taken by households. This study proposes that a decision of acceptance or rejection of PV systems is the past behaviour of the battery adoption decision. This antecedent role of PV behaviour may spark two attitudinal changes: (a) feelings of regret, which may occur among PV adopters, stemming from a positive experience of using the system, or among non-adopters due to their rejection of the system, and (b) feelings of despair, which may arise among current PV users due to dissatisfaction and discontent with the system. While regret positively changes consumers’ attitude towards battery adoption expediting an earlier purchase, despair could preclude battery installation. Through a survey of 557 households in South East Queensland, Australia, this study investigated factors driving attitude change. Instead of traditional statistical methods, machine learning algorithms were adopted to derive data-driven models of attitude change, allowing for higher prediction accuracy and a determination of the latent causalities. The main findings indicate that perceived attitudes towards financial and non-financial benefits, followed by informal peers, best estimate the attitude change, whereas traditional sociodemographic factors, knowledge and affordability may not engender a shift. Leveraging from this new paradigm can encourage current PV consumers to take another step and become earlier battery adopters. Failure to recognise these dynamics may breed despair and turn current innovators and early adopters of PVs into late adopters or rejectors of battery systems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaffordability 3abatteries 3aenergy 3aprediction 3asurveys 3aQueensland 0aAttitude change 0aSolar photovoltaic (PV) system 0aBattery energy storage system 0aArtificial intelligence 0aTechnology diffusion1 aTaghikhah, Firouzeh1 aIrannezhad, Elnaz1 aStewart, Rodney A.1 aSahin, Oz0 tApplied energy.g2022 July 15, v. 318 p.119194-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11876x0306-26197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2022.1191943Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02609naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001900146245009400165300001400259520132400273592002801597650002001625650001401645650001401659650001301673650001701686650001201703650002001715650001301735650002601748653002701774653002601801653001201827653001201839653001101851700001601862700001501878700001201893700001601905700001501921700001901936773010701955856008002062852000902142655001202151IND60602151720221120060336.0180709e20150901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060215172DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ab.2015.05.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhou, Ningling10aSequential extractions: A new way for protein quantification—data from peanut allergens  ap. 31-36.  aQuantification of certain protein contents in the matrix is essential in protein analyses. The amount of total protein in the matrix can be determined by the Kjeldahl method. However, few methods can quantify certain protein contents in the matrix without extracting all of them in solution. Extracting all of the contents is difficult for proteins, especially relatively insoluble ones. A five-step sequential extraction method was developed for the quantification of certain proteins in defatted peanut flour based on the relationship between the extracted protein contents and the extraction times. The extracted proteins (i.e., total protein, Ara h 1, and Ara h 2) were quantitatively analyzed in each extraction of the same condition. An exponential equation was obtained between the extraction times and the respective amount of extracted protein as well as both the total protein and a particular protein. In particular, the amount of protein extracted each time can be a geometric sequence. If all proteins can be extracted with sufficient extraction times, the protein contents in the peanut matrix can be calculated using a mathematical summation formula. This sum should be all proteins in the matrix. The five-step sequential extraction method can provide a means to quantify certain proteins in the matrix.  aPublisher supplied data 3aKjeldahl method 3aallergens 3aequations 3ageometry 3apeanut flour 3apeanuts 3aprotein content 3aproteins 3aquantitative analysis 0aProtein quantification 0aSequential extraction 0aAra h 1 0aAra h 2 0aPeanut1 aLi, Wenying1 aWu, Zhihua1 aLi, Xin1 aYang, Anshu1 aTong, Ping1 aChen, Hongbing0 tAnalytical biochemistry.g2015 Sept. 01, v. 484 p.31-36dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11652x0003-26977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ab.2015.05.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03771naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002100139245010500160300001800265520246600283592002802749650002402777650002402801650001502825650002002840650001102860650001102871650002202882650001702904650001702921650002102938650001502959650002102974651001102995651001303006700002103019700001903040700003003059700003303089700001803122773010303140856007303243852000903316655001203325IND60435921520221118183226.0151020e201511  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6043592152DNAL7 a10.1111/jvs.123102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDöbert, Timm F.10aCan leaf area index and biomass be estimated from Braun‐Blanquet cover scores in tropical forests?  ap. 1043-1053.  aQUESTIONS: The loss and degradation of tropical forests is having severe impacts on the dynamics of understorey plant communities. Understanding these impacts requires efficient ways to measure vegetation change over broad spatial and temporal scales. Leaf area index (LAI) and above‐ground biomass are preferred quantitative measures of variation in plant community structure. However, their accurate measurement requires destructive sampling, which can be impractical or inappropriate. Here we test whether semi‐quantitative assessment of Braun‐Blanquet vegetation cover scores is a reliable proxy for direct quantitative measures of LAI and above‐ground biomass of differing plant growth forms (PGF) within tropical forests. LOCATION: Six hundred square kilometre area of tropical lowland rain forest in Sabah, Malaysia. METHODS: We sampled understorey rain forest plant communities across a disturbance gradient in 2 × 2 m plots at 301 locations. We used a modified Braun‐Blanquet scale to estimate plant cover, destructively harvested all live above‐ground biomass up to a height of 2 m, calculated the above‐ground biomass of each species from separately processed stem and leaf fractions in each plot, and then calculated LAI using reference measures of specific leaf area for each species. For each of nine PGFs, we regressed LAI and biomass against the nine‐point Braun‐Blanquet ordinal transform scale (OTS) using linear mixed effects models. RESULTS: We found a simple, uniform logarithmic scaling of LAI with increasing Braun‐Blanquet cover classes that was consistent across most PGFs, and with slope estimates close to 1.0. By contrast, no simple scaling relationship was found for above‐ground biomass, with most PGFs exhibiting an asymptotic relationship in which the Braun‐Blanquet estimates across high cover scores provided almost no resolution of observed variation in empirical biomass measures. CONCLUSIONS: We found that the Braun‐Blanquet OTS provides a remarkably simple and accurate logarithmic scaling of LAI, but care should be taken in applying scaling rules uniformly across PGFs. In contrast, the Braun‐Blanquet OTS shows a more complex relationship with plant above‐ground biomass and we caution against its unconditional use for biomass estimation. The findings of this study should be broadly applicable to other ecosystems due to the heterogeneity of plant communities included in this work.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaboveground biomass 3acommunity structure 3aecosystems 3aleaf area index 3aleaves 3amodels 3aplant communities 3aplant growth 3arain forests 3atropical forests 3aunderstory 3avegetation cover 3aBorneo 3aMalaysia1 aWebber, Bruce L.1 aSugau, John B.1 aDickinson, Katharine J.M.1 aDidham, R.

The aim of the study was the proposal of the SDI openness assessment approach based on existing openness assessment frameworks, as well as the presentation of the Polish Spatial Data Infrastructure (PSDI) development towards openness. The results indicated that ten geodetic and cartographic databases fulfilled ten out of eleven criteria of data openness, according to the methodological assumptions, and reached a 3-star level of openness. The need for further development of the infrastructure towards sharing public administration data is recognized, as well as non-governmental data that meet the open data criteria, thus contributing to the openness of the SDI. The proposed assessment method, referenced to a five-level data openness system and providing clear scoring benchmarking for assessing SDI openness, may be used for comparative analysis of SDI openness in different countries, including EU Member States that draw on the experience of the implementation of the INSPIRE Directive.  aThis work was supported by a statutory grant from the Military University of Technology, no.

Metal–organic frameworks (MOFs), which have been widely explored as versatile fluorescence sensors, are still at a standstill for aggregation-induced emission (AIE), and no example of MOFs showing a dynamic AIE activity has been reported yet. Herein, we report a novel MOF, which successfully converts the aggregation-caused quenching of the autologous ligand molecule to be AIE-active upon framework construction and exhibits bright fluorescence in a highly viscous environment, resulting in the first example of MOFs exhibiting a real dynamic AIE activity. Furthermore, a linear CO₂ fluorescence quantification for mixed gases in the concentration range of 2.5–100% was thus well-established. These results herald the understanding and advent of a new generation in all solid-state fluorescence fields.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon dioxide 3acoordination polymers 3afluorescence 3agases 3aligands 0aCO2 fluorescence quantification 0ametal−organic frameworks 0aaggregation-induced emission 0aaggregation-caused quenching 0avisible turn-on sensor 0aJ aggregates1 aCai, Wei1 aChen, Xiahui1 aGuan, Rong-Feng1 aWang, Lu-Ming1 aHou, Gui-Hua1 aXi, Xin-Guo1 aZhang, Qin-Fang1 aYang, Xiu-Li1 aShao, Rong0 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2018 Jan. 24, v. 10, no. 3 p.2868-2873dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.7b177933Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02087naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245009200164300001800256520103700274592002801311650001601339650001301355650001501368650001901383650004401402650001301446650000901459650001601468700001601484700001301500700001701513773011701530856008101647852000901728655001201737IND60121045920221118115714.0150214e201404  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012104592DNAL7 a10.1007/s00216-014-7660-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhu, Zhanyun10aMicrostructure elucidation of historic silk (Bombyx mori) by nuclear magnetic resonance  ap. 2709-2718.  a¹H NMR cryoporometry and solid-state¹³C cross-polarization (CP) magic-angle spinning (MAS) NMR spectroscopy were used to characterize the microstructure of historic and fresh silk samples.

Compared with the fresh silk samples, the volume of pores around 1.1 nm decreased distinctly in the historic silk, and more pores larger than 2 nm emerged accordingly. In addition, these results correlated well with solid-state¹³C CP/MAS NMR spectroscopy as the percentage of random coil in the historic silk sample was much less than that in the fresh silk samples. Therefore, it is suggested that the water-filled microvoids grow larger as the random coil conformation fades away in the degradation process.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBombyx mori 3afibroins 3amicropores 3amicrostructure 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aporosity 3asilk 3atemperature1 aGong, Decai1 aLiu, Liu1 aWang, Yusong0 tAnalytical and bioanalytical chemistry.g2014 Apr., v. 406, no. 11 p.2709-2718dSpringer-Verlagx1618-26427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00216-014-7660-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03013naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001900146245016500165300001600330520141300346592002801759650001901787650002301806650002001829650001601849650002001865650001801885650002201903650002601925650000901951650002101960650000701981650001301988650001402001650002302015650001302038650001502051650002902066653001902095653002802114653002202142653002002164653002202184653001302206700002202219700001902241700002502260773010902285856008002394852000902474655001202483IND60602151920221120050742.0180709e20150901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060215192DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ab.2015.05.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSajic, Tatjana10aComparison of fractionation strategies for offline two-dimensional liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry analysis of proteins from mouse adipose tissue  ap. 122-132.  aIn the frame of protein identification from mouse adipose tissue, two strategies were compared for the offline elution of peptides from a strong cation exchange (SCX) column in two-dimensional liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (2D–LC–MS/MS) analyses. First, the salt gradient (using K⁺ as displacing agent) was evaluated from 25 to 500mM KCl. Then, a less investigated elution mode using a pH gradient (using citric acid and ammonium hydroxide) was carried out from pH 2.5 to 9.0. Equal amounts of peptide digest derived from mouse adipose tissue were loaded onto the SCX column and fractionated according to the two approaches. A total of 15 fractions were collected in two independent experiments for each SCX elution strategy. Then, each fraction was analyzed on a nanoLC–MS/MS platform equipped with a column-switching unit for desalting and enrichment. No substantial differences in peptide quality characteristics (molecular weight, isoelectric point, or GRAVY [grand average of hydropathicity] index distributions) were observed between the two datasets. The pH gradient approach was found to be superior, with 27.5% more unique peptide identifications and 10% more distinct protein identifications compared with the salt-based elution method. In conclusion, our data imply that the pH gradient SCX fractionation is more desirable for proteomics analysis of entire adipose tissue.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadipose tissue 3aammonium hydroxide 3acation exchange 3acitric acid 3adata collection 3afractionation 3aisoelectric point 3aliquid chromatography 3amice 3amolecular weight 3apH 3apeptides 3apotassium 3apotassium chloride 3aproteins 3aproteomics 3atandem mass spectrometry 0aAdipose tissue 0aOffline 2D–LC–MS/MS 0aSCX fractionation 0apH gradient SCX 0aSalt gradient SCX 0aPeptides1 aVaresio, Emmanuel1 aSzanto, Ildiko1 aHopfgartner, Gérard0 tAnalytical biochemistry.g2015 Sept. 01, v. 484 p.122-132dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11652x0003-26977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ab.2015.05.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03645naa a2200685 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001500148245017800163500002200341520148100363592002801844650002101872650001901893650002001912650001601932650001601948650003101964650001401995650002202009650001302031650001502044650004302059650005202102650001802154650001802172650001802190653001502208653002702223653003202250653000902282653000902291653001502300653002602315653000802341653003002349653000802379653002902387653000902416653004402425653001402469653004302483653000802526653004202534653000802576653003102584700001402615700001702629700001202646700001402658700001702672700005202689773011502741856008202856852000902938655001202947IND60617571720221119170507.0181025s2018    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061757172DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbrc.2018.10.0652doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMeng, Qian14aThe proteomic study of serially passaged human skin fibroblast cells uncovers down-regulation of the chromosome condensin complex proteins involved in replicative senescence  aPre-press version  aDermal fibroblast is one of the major constitutive cells of skin and plays a central role in skin senescence. The replicative senescence of fibroblasts may cause skin aging, bad wound healing, skin diseases and even cancer. In this study, a label-free quantitative proteomic approach was employed to analyzing the serial passaged human skin fibroblast (CCD-1079Sk) cells, resulting in 3371 proteins identified. Of which, 280 proteins were significantly changed in early passage (6 passages, P6), middle passage (12 passages, P12) and late passage (21 passages, P21), with a time-dependent decrease or increase tendency. Bioinformatic analysis demonstrated that the chromosome condensin complex, including structural maintenance of chromosomes protein 2 (SMC2) and structural maintenance of chromosomes protein 4 (SMC4), were down-regulated in the serially passaged fibroblast cells. The qRT-PCR and Western Blot experiments confirmed that the expression of these two proteins were significantly down-regulated in a time-dependent manner in the subculture of human skin fibroblasts (HSFb cells). In summary, we used serially passaged human skin fibroblast cells coupled with quantitative proteomic approach to profile the protein expression pattern in the temporal progress of replicative senescence in HSFb cells and revealed that the down-regulation of the chromosome condensin complex subunits, such as SMC2 and SMC4, may play an important role in the fibroblast senescence.  aPublisher supplied data 3aWestern blotting 3abioinformatics 3acell senescence 3achromosomes 3afibroblasts 3agene expression regulation 3aneoplasms 3aprotein synthesis 3aproteins 3aproteomics 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3askin (animal) 3askin diseases 3atissue repair 0aProteomics 0aReplicative senescence 0aHuman skin fibroblast cells 0aSMC2 0aSMC4 0aHSFb cells 0aHuman skin fibroblast 0aLFQ 0aLabel free quantification 0aPDT 0aPopulation doubling time 0aKEGG 0aKyoto Encyclopedia of genes and genomes 0aSA-β-Gal 0aSenescence-associated β-galactosidase 0aSMC 0aStructural maintenance of chromosomes 0aMCM 0aMinichromosome maintenance1 aGao, Jing1 aZhu, Hongwen1 aHe, Han1 aLü, Zhi,1 aHong, Minhua1 aZhou, Hu1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7006-47370 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2018, dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl46848x0006-291X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2018.10.0653Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02010naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001800149245012400167300001600291520069800307592002801005650003001033650002201063650001101085650001301096650002201109650001301131653003001144653002901174653002001203653001201223653002001235700002201255700001801277700001901295700001701314700002001331700001801351700001901369773009501388856008401483852000901567655001201576IND60557744920221122054727.0190416e201612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055774492DNAL7 a10.1016/j.algal.2016.10.0182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Xiaojuan10aAddressing various compartments of the diatom model organism Phaeodactylum tricornutum via sub-cellular marker proteins  ap. 249-257.  aThe diatom Phaeodactylum tricornutum is a prominent organism to study protein import mechanisms into complex plastids surrounded by four membranes.

At least in the case of sub-cellular localization studies, the different compartments of this complex structured organism have to be addressed by marker molecules.

Cartilage endplate stem cells (CESCs) also showed potential for nucleus pulposus (NP) regeneration in a rabbit disc degeneration model, the precise mechanism was unclear. Here we investigated the effects of CESCs on NP cells (NPCs) proliferation and the mechanism in vitro. CESCs and NPCs were isolated from surgical specimens of degenerative human lumbar disc. NPCs were co-cultured with CESCs at a 1:1 ratio or cultured in CESCs conditioned medium (CESCs-CM). NPCs proliferation was evaluated by Ki-67 staining, CCK-8 assay and cell cycle analysis. Gene expressions were detected by qRT-PCR and activation of Akt and ERK1/2 was detected by western blot. CXCR4 antagonist AMD3100 was used to block SDF-1/CXCR4 axis. ERK1/2 and Akt inhibitors were used to block Akt and ERK1/2 activation. Results showed that NPCs proliferation was promoted by direct-contact co-culturing with CESCs as well as culturing in CESCs-CM. SDF-1 expression level in CESCs was significantly higher than that in NPCs, while CXCR4 was the opposite. Promotion of NPCs proliferation mediated by CESCs-CM could be partially attenuated by AMD3100. CESCs-CM activated both Akt and ERK1/2 in NPCs, while rhSDF-1 scarcely activated Akt but obviously activated ERK1/2. Akt and ERK1/2 inhibitors could partially inhibited CESCs-CM mediated promotion of NPCs proliferation and showed cumulative effect, while ERK1/2 inhibitor and AMD3100 could significantly abrogate SDF-1 mediated promotion of NPCs proliferation. Our results suggested that CESCs might promote NPCs proliferation in a paracrine pathway, which was partially mediated by SDF-1/CXCR4 axis via ERK1/2 signaling transduction pathway.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCXCR4 receptor 3aWestern blotting 3aantagonists 3acell cycle 3acell proliferation 3acoculture 3agene expression 3ahumans 3aintervertebral disks 3amodels 3apain 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3arabbits 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3astaining 3astem cells 0aCartilage endplate stem cells 0aNucleus pulposus cells 0aSDF-1/CXCR4 axis 0aProliferation1 aJia, Min1 aYu, Youjia1 aYuan, Chao1 aWang, Jian0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2018 Nov. 17, v. 506, no. 1 p.94-101dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl46848x0006-291X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2018.10.0693Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02067naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002300146245010000169300001400269520070400283592002800987650002001015650001301035650003501048650004201083650001801125650001601143650001601159650002001175650001401195650001201209650001801221653001801239653003701257653000901294653001001303653001401313700002601327700003201353700004001385773010701425856008001532852000901612655001201621IND60602152120221120034611.0180709e20150915xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060215212DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ab.2015.05.0172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNadiya, Fasiludeen10aHigh-quality RNA extraction from small cardamom tissues rich in polysaccharides and polyphenols  ap. 25-27.  aDue to the presence of a diverse array of metabolites, no standard method of RNA isolation is available for plants.

The results showed that Fe/TS-1 catalyst exhibited better FTS performance than Fe/TiO2 and Fe/SiO2 with higher CO conversion and C5+ selectivity. The desilication treatment of TS-1 further increased the FTS performance of Fe/TS-1 catalyst in terms of activity and stability. These iron-based catalysts were characterized by N2 adsorption, H2 temperature-programmed reduction, X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, scanning electronic microscopy and thermal gravimetric analysis. The factors influencing the FTS performance of the iron-based catalyst were discussed and the results indicated that not only the dispersion but also the reduction degree of iron oxides increased after desilication treatment of TS-1 support through generating more mesoporous structures and increasing the crystallinity degree of TS-1. The improved FTS activity is due to the increased dispersion of iron particles without affecting the original reducibility. The better stability is due to the enhanced heat and mass transfer as well as the high resistance against coke formation and deposition.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFischer-Tropsch reaction 3aX-ray diffraction 3aadsorption 3acatalysts 3acrystal structure 3aheat 3ahydrogen 3airon 3airon oxides 3amass transfer 3aporous media 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asilica 3athermogravimetry 3atitanium dioxide 3atransmission electron microscopy 0aFischer–Tropsch synthesis 0aIron catalyst 0aDispersion 0aDistribution 0aReducibility1 aXu, Yan1 aQiao, Yu1 aLi, Zhen-Hua1 aMa, Xin-Bin0 tFuel processing technology.g2015 Nov., v. 139 p.25-32dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12445x0378-38207nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fuproc.2015.08.0193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02142naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001400146245007900160300002000239520110100259592002801360650002301388650001701411650002101428650001601449650001301465650002301478650001101501650001501512700001701527700001701544700001101561773012901572856008201701852000901783655001201792IND60576452920221118040959.0170804e20170727xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057645292DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.7b033262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Yang10aHigh Reactivity of the ZnO(0001) Polar Surface: The Role of Oxygen Adatoms  ap. 15711-15718.  aUnderstanding the mechanism of water dissociation on metal oxide surfaces is of particular interest in catalytic reactions. In this work, the interaction of water with the ZnO(0001) polar surface is investigated, and the role of oxygen adatoms in water splitting is uncovered. The individual surface energies and electronic properties of ZnO polar surfaces are investigated on the basis of density functional theory calculations. The oxygen adatoms on the ZnO(0001) surface introduce in-gap surface states, resulting in a direct-to-indirect band gap transition. Water strongly interacts with oxygen adatoms to spontaneously form hydroxyl groups, recovering the direct band-gap characteristics of ZnO polar surfaces. Furthermore, water prefers to adsorb at the step edges of cavities after all of the oxygen adatoms are consumed, and the hydrogen-bonded network among water molecules triggers the dissociation of water at the edge sites, which is also confirmed by molecular dynamics calculations. Our results provide atomic-scale insight into the interactions of water with the ZnO(0001) surface.  aPublisher supplied data 3acatalytic activity 3adissociation 3ahydrogen bonding 3amethodology 3amoieties 3amolecular dynamics 3aoxygen 3azinc oxide1 aXu, Wangping1 aShan, Yueyue1 aXu, Hu0 tThe Journal of Physical Chemistry C.g2017 July 27, v. 121, no. 29 p.15711-15718dAmerican Chemical Societyx1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.jpcc.7b033263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02976naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100005400144245010600198300001800304520148400322592002801806650001701834650001701851650001401868650001701882650002301899650002101922650002401943650001501967650001401982650001101996650002202007653001702029653002202046653001902068653003002087700001502117700001602132700001902148700001302167700001602180700001602196700005602212773013902268856007802407852000902485655001202494IND60595443720221120063912.0180605e20180228xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059544372DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.7b182082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWei, Renjie1http://orcid.org/0000-0002-0459-719610aHigh-Index Faceted Porous Co3O4 Nanosheets with Oxygen Vacancies for Highly Efficient Water Oxidation  ap. 7079-7086.  aBecause of sluggish kinetics of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), designing low-cost, highly active, and stable electrocatalysts for OER is important for the development of sustainable electrochemical water splitting. Here, {112} high-index facet exposed porous Co₃O₄ nanosheets with oxygen vacancies on the surface have been successfully synthesized via a simple hydrothermal method followed by NaBH₄ reduction. As compared with the pristine and other faceted porous Co₃O₄ nanosheets (e.g., {110} and {111}), the as-prepared {112} faceted porous nanosheets exhibit a much lower overpotential of 318 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm–². Importantly, these nanosheets also give excellent electrochemical stability, displaying an insignificant change in the required overpotential at a current density of 10 mA cm–² even after a 14 h long-term chronoamperometric test. All these superior OER activity and stability could be attributed to their unique hierarchical structures assembled by ultrathin porous nanosheets, {112} high-index exposed facets with higher ratio of Co²⁺/Co³⁺ and oxygen vacancies on the surface, which can substantially enhance the charge transfer rate and increase the number of active sites. All these findings not only demonstrate the potency of our Co₃O₄ nanosheets for efficient water oxidation but also provide further insights into developing cost-effective and high-performance catalysts for electrochemical applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactive sites 3aborohydrides 3acatalysts 3acobalt oxide 3acost effectiveness 3aelectrochemistry 3ahot water treatment 3ananosheets 3aoxidation 3aoxygen 3aoxygen production 0acobalt oxide 0ahigh-index facets 0aoxygen vacancy 0aoxygen evolution reaction1 aFang, Ming1 aDong, Guofa1 aLan, Changyong1 aShu, Lei1 aZhang, Heng1 aBu, Xiuming1 aHo, Johnny C.1http://orcid.org/0000-0003-3000-87940 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2018 Feb. 28, v. 10, no. 8 p.7079-7086dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.7b182083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04055naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245014500168300001600313500001500329520204300344592002802387650001202415650002602427650001002453650000902463650001202472650001702484650001102501650001802512650002402530650002102554650000902575650001802584650001402602650002102616650001802637650001402655653001702669653001802686653001902704653003302723653001502756653002702771653001402798653002802812653006002840653002402900653004502924653010302969700001803072700001603090700001803106700002203124700001803146700001903164700001403183773011403197856008503311852000903396655001203405IND60604517520221123015956.0180717e20150410xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060451752DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jconrel.2015.02.0262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Wenli10aPost-insertion of poloxamer 188 strengthened liposomal membrane and reduced drug irritancy and in vivo precipitation, superior to PEGylation  ap. 161-169.  a2019-12-06  aThe ultimate aim of this study was to develop asulacrine (ASL)-loaded long-circulating liposomes to prevent phlebitis during intravenous (i.v.) infusion for chemotherapy. Poly(ethylene)glycol (PEG) and poloxamer 188-modified liposomes (ASL-PEGL and ASL-P188L) were developed, and ASL was loaded using a remote loading method facilitated with a low concentration of sulfobutyl ether-β-cyclodextrin as a drug solubilizer. The liposomes were characterized in terms of morphology, size, release properties and stability. Pharmacokinetics and venous tissue tolerance of the formulations were simultaneously studied in rabbits following one-hour i.v. infusion via the ear vein. The irritancy was assessed using a rat paw-lift/lick model after subplantar injections. High drug loading 9.0% w/w was achieved with no drug leakage found from ASL-PEGL or ASL-P188L suspended in a 5% glucose solution at 30days. However, a rapid release (leakage) from ASL-PEGL was observed when PBS was used as release medium, partially related to the use of cyclodextrin in drug loading. Post-insertion of poloxamer 188 to the liposomes appeared to be able to restore the drug retention possibly by increasing the packing density of phospholipids in the membrane. In rabbits (n=5), ASL-P188L had a prolonged half-life with no drug precipitation or inflammation in the rabbit ear vein in contrast to ASL solution. Following subplantar (footpad) injections in rats ASL solution induced paw-lick/lift responses in all rats whereas ASL-P188L caused no response (n=8). PEGylation showed less benefit possibly due to the drug ‘leakage’. In conclusion, drug precipitation in the vein and the drug mild irritancy may both contribute to the occurrence of phlebitis caused by the ASL solution, and could both be prevented by encapsulation of the drug in liposomes. Poloxamer 188 appeared to be able to ‘seal’ the liposomal membrane and enhance drug retention. The study also highlighted the importance of bio-relevant in vitro release study in formulation screening.  aPublisher supplied data 3arabbits 3aintravenous injection 3adrugs 3aears 3aglucose 3ainflammation 3amodels 3aencapsulation 3apolyethylene glycol 3achemical bonding 3arats 3aphospholipids 3ascreening 3apharmacokinetics 3acyclodextrins 3ahalf life 0adrug therapy 0aPoloxamer 188 0aDrug retention 0aPost-injection precipitation 0aIrritation 0aCholesterol (CID 5997) 0aPhlebitis 0aAsulacrine (CID 107924) 0a1,2-Dipalmitoyl-rac-glycero-3-phosphocholine (CID 6139) 0aPEGylated liposomes 0aAsulacrine isethionate salt (CID 157348) 0a1,2-Distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine-N-[methoxy(polyethylene glycol)-2000] (CID 406952)1 aWang, Guangji1 aSee, Esther1 aShaw, John P.1 aBaguley, Bruce C.1 aLiu, Jianping1 aAmirapu, Satya1 aWu, Zimei0 tJournal of controlled release.g2015 Apr. 10, v. 203 p.161-169dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12462x0168-36597nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jconrel.2015.02.0263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04247naa a2200709 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100005700151245008100208300001400289520185100303592002802154650001202182650001702194650001802211650001702229650001002246650001802256650001402274650001102288650002102299650002102320650000902341650004302350650001102393650001902404650002202423650001402445650001302459650001602472653006802488653006802556653007502624653011402699653003702813653005102850653003302901653003002934653002102964653001302985653002202998653002703020653002203047653003103069700001903100700002703119700002003146700001803166700003003184700002003214700002303234700002303257700002303280700001603303773011203319856008503431852000903516655001203525IND60604517720221123020038.0180717e20150410xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060451772DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jconrel.2015.02.0282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLajunen, Tatu1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6234-919310aLight induced cytosolic drug delivery from liposomes with gold nanoparticles  ap. 85-98.  aExternally triggered drug release at defined targets allows site- and time-controlled drug treatment regimens. We have developed liposomal drug carriers with encapsulated gold nanoparticles for triggered drug release. Light energy is converted to heat in the gold nanoparticles and released to the lipid bilayers. Localized temperature increase renders liposomal bilayers to be leaky and triggers drug release. The aim of this study was to develop a drug releasing system capable of releasing its cargo to cell cytosol upon triggering with visible and near infrared light signals. The liposomes were formulated using either heat-sensitive or heat- and pH-sensitive lipid compositions with star or rod shaped gold nanoparticles. Encapsulated fluorescent probe, calcein, was released from the liposomes after exposure to the light. In addition, the pH-sensitive formulations showed a faster drug release in acidic conditions than in neutral conditions. The liposomes were internalized into human retinal pigment epithelial cells (ARPE-19) and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and did not show any cellular toxicity. The light induced cytosolic delivery of calcein from the gold nanoparticle containing liposomes was shown, whereas no cytosolic release was seen without light induction or without gold nanoparticles in the liposomes. The light activated liposome formulations showed a controlled content release to the cellular cytosol at a specific location and time. Triggering with visual and near infrared light allows good tissue penetration and safety, and the pH-sensitive liposomes may enable selective drug release in the intracellular acidic compartments (endosomes, lysosomes). Thus, light activated liposomes with gold nanoparticles are an attractive option for time- and site-specific drug delivery into the target cells.  aPublisher supplied data 3acytosol 3acytotoxicity 3adrug carriers 3adrug therapy 3adrugs 3aencapsulation 3aendosomes 3aenergy 3aepithelial cells 3afluorescent dyes 3aheat 3ahuman umbilical vein endothelial cells 3ahumans 3alipid bilayers 3alipid composition 3alysosomes 3ananogold 3atemperature 0a1,2-Dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (PubChem CID: 6138) 0a1,2-Distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (PubChem CID: 94190) 0a1-Stearoyl-2-hydroxy-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (PubChem CID: 497299) 0a1,2-Distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine-N-[methoxy(polyethylene glycol)-2000] (PubChem CID: 86278269) 0a1,3-Diolein (PubChem CID: 33120) 0aCholesteryl hemisuccinate (PubChem CID: 65082) 0aCalcein (PubChem CID: 65079) 0aGold (PubChem CID: 23985) 0aLight activation 0aLiposome 0aGold nanoparticle 0aIntracellular delivery 0aTriggered release 0aRetinal pigment epithelium1 aViitala, Lauri1 aKontturi, Leena-Stiina1 aLaaksonen, Timo1 aLiang, Huamin1 aVuorimaa-Laukkanen, Elina1 aViitala, Tapani1 aLe Guével, Xavier1 aYliperttula, Marjo1 aMurtomäki, Lasse,1 aUrtti, Arto0 tJournal of controlled release.g2015 Apr. 10, v. 203 p.85-98dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12462x0168-36597nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jconrel.2015.02.0283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03321naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245012400171300001600295520191000311592002802221650001102249650001102260650001102271650002202282650001502304650001202319650002002331650001202351650001102363650001502374650002202389650001502411651001102426653002202437653002102459653002202480653002102502653001902523653002202542700002202564700002202586700002102608773011602629856008502745852000902830655001202839IND60549639220221119114638.0190403e20161101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054963922DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foreco.2016.08.0212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBladon, Kevin D.12aA catchment-scale assessment of stream temperature response to contemporary forest harvesting in the Oregon Coast Range  ap. 153-164.  aHistorical forest harvesting practices, where the riparian canopy was removed, generally increased energy loading to the stream and produced higher stream temperatures. As such, contemporary forest management practices require maintenance of streamside vegetation as riparian management areas, with an important function of providing shade and minimizing solar radiation loading to streams to mitigate stream water temperature changes. The Alsea Watershed Study Revisited in the Oregon Coast Range provided a unique opportunity to investigate and compare the stream temperature responses to contemporary forest harvesting practices (i.e., maintenance of riparian vegetation) with the impacts from historical (1960s) harvesting practices (i.e., no riparian vegetation). Here we present an analysis of 6years (3years pre-harvest and 3years post-harvest) of summer stream temperature data from a reference (Flynn Creek) and a harvested catchment (Needle Branch). There was no evidence that the (a) 7-day moving mean of daily maximum (T7DAYMAX) stream temperature, (b) mean daily stream temperature, or (c) diel stream temperature changed in the study stream reaches following contemporary forest harvesting practices. The only parameter of interest that changed after forest harvesting was the T7DAYMAX when analyses were constrained to the Oregon regulatory period of July 15 to August 15 and all sites in each catchment were grouped together—in this case stream temperature increased 0.6±0.2°C (p=0.002). However, over the entire post-harvest study period, the warmest maximum daily stream temperature observed in Needle Branch was 14.7°C—in the original Alsea Watershed Study, maximum daily stream temperatures rose to 21.7°C (1966) and 29.4°C (1967) in the first two post-harvest years, providing evidence that current harvesting practices have improved protection for stream water temperatures.  aPublisher supplied data 3acanopy 3acoasts 3aenergy 3aforest management 3aharvesting 3alogging 3asolar radiation 3astreams 3asummer 3avegetation 3awater temperature 3awatersheds 3aOregon 0aForest management 0aHeadwater stream 0aPacific Northwest 0aRiparian buffers 0aThermal regime 0aWater temperature1 aCook, Nicholas A.1 aLight, Jeffrey T.1 aSegura, Catalina0 tForest ecology and management.g2016 Nov. 01, v. 379 p.153-164dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl9013x0378-11277nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2016.08.0213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03110naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002000143245012400163500001400287520177600301592002802077650002502105650001302130650001802143650001902161650001602180650000902196650002102205650002302226650001402249650001202263650001102275653001702286653001902303653003202322653001302354700002202367700002502389700002102414700002102435773012202456856007702578852000902655655001202664IND60694549420221116185440.0200513e20100101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069454942DNAL7 a10.4081/ijas.2010.e152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSaroglia, Marco10aDissolved oxygen regimen (PO₂) may affect osmo respiratory compromise in European sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax, L.)  aNAL-light  aFundamentally, in land based mediterranean aquaculture, two techniques are applied to supply water with oxygen: paddling water aeration and application of pure oxygen. The two oxygenation techniques result in quite different PO₂ regimens and, consequently, different fish growth performance and gill morphology. Data exist showing a reduction in total respiratory surface (RSA) and increasing gas diffusion distance (GDD) in gills of sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax, L.) farmed under elevated PO₂ regimens. That such a modification might have an effect on the ion regulation has been defined elsewhere as osmorespiratory compromise. In this study, European sea bass previously acclimatized to two PO₂ regimens, mild hypoxia and mild hyperoxia (70–80% and 130–140% of the saturation value, respectively), were challenged for 1 hour with hypo-osmotic plus manipulation stress in two separate trials. During the first trial, when only Na⁺ loss was determined, the ion efflux during the first 5 min resulted in a rate of 163.72±31 and 112.23±87 nmol g⁻¹ min⁻¹ from hypoxia and hyperoxia sea bass groups, respectively, and, if sustained, would approach 15.3 and 11.2% per hour of the total body Na⁺, respectively. During the second trial, in which both Na⁺ and Cl⁻ loss were determined, after 60 min the Na⁺ loss was shown to be 76.86±12 and 179.28±32 nmol g⁻¹ min⁻¹ for the fish previously acclimatized to hyperoxia and hypoxia regimens, respectively, whereas for Cl⁻ this loss was 62.02±11 and 157.28±28 nmol g⁻¹ min⁻¹, respectively. Our data are compatible with the hypothesis of an osmotic advantage of sea bass exposed to an elevated PO₂ regimen, achievable with application of pure oxygen, instead of simple water aeration.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDicentrarchus labrax 3aaeration 3aanimal growth 3aanimal science 3aaquaculture 3abass 3adissolved oxygen 3agrowth performance 3ahyperoxia 3ahypoxia 3aoxygen 0aFish welfare 0aIon regulation 0aOsmo-respiratory compromise 0aTeleosts1 aCaricato, Gaetano1 aFrittella, Ferruccio1 aBrambilla, Fabio1 aTerova, Genciana0 tItalian journal of animal science.g2010 Jan. 1, v. 9, no. 1 p.e15-dTaylor & FranciswJournal:11638x1828-051X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.4081/ijas.2010.e153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02030naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245011300165300001600278520091700294592002801211650001501239650001301254650001401267650002501281650001101306650002301317650001601340650001901356700001801375700001901393700001901412700001501431773009701446856008101543990002301624852000901647655001201656IND60093202220221118031608.0141103e20130101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009320222DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cej.2012.10.0702doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Weishan10aKinetics and equilibriums for adsorption of poly(vinyl alcohol) from aqueous solution onto natural bentonite  ap. 343-354.  aKinetics and isotherms for the adsorption of poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) from aqueous solution onto natural bentonite were investigated systematically with respect to initial concentration, contact time and temperature. The kinetics of the adsorption process were discussed using three kinetic models, viz., pseudo-first-order, pseudo-second-order, and intraparticle diffusion kinetic model. The experimental data fitted well with pseudo-second-order kinetic model. The adsorption isotherms were also described by Langmuir, Freundlich and Dubinin–Radushkevich (D–R) isotherm model, respectively. It was found that the isotherms obeyed Langmuir model. FTIR results indicated the presence of PVA on the surface of bentonite/PVA complexes. XRD measurements showed that PVA molecules intercalated into the interlayers of bentonite. Zeta potential of bentonite particles decreased with increasing PVA concentration.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3aalcohols 3abentonite 3achemical engineering 3amodels 3asorption isotherms 3atemperature 3azeta potential1 aZheng, Baicun1 aDeng, Zuiliang1 aFeng, Zhongjun1 aFu, Lefeng0 tChemical engineering journal.g2013 Jan. 1, v. 214 p.343-354dElsevier B.V.x1385-89477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cej.2012.10.0703Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01801naa a2200313 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002400075024005000099040001800149100002000167245004200187300001400229500000900243500001500252520086000267592002801127650002201155650001201177650001401189650001201203650000901215651001401224653001101238773012001249852000901369856009701378655001201475991565999850742620221119193422.0191122e197501  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aCAIN7590260792DNAL7 a10.2134/agronj1975.00021962006700010027x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRobinson, R.

Sunflowers planted in east-west and north-south rows in large, rectangular plots were compared in 1972 and 1973 at Rosemount, MN. Wheel-spoke plant alignments in circular plantings were used to evaluate row directions in 1973. Row direction did not influence achene yield, weight, size, nor oil percentage, but plants lodged significantly more in EW than in NS rows both years. However, in the circular plantings, lodging differences did not occur. Row direction effect on sunflowers is not an important consideration for commercial production. For some research plots, EW rows with plot labels on the east end are easiest to evaluate because most heads face the viewer.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHelianthus annuus 3aachenes 3aflowering 3alodging 3aoils 3aMinnesota 0aplants0 tAgronomy journal.g1975 Jan., v. 67, no. 1 p.93-94dAmerican Society of AgronomywJournal:jnl44592x0002-19627nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2134/agronj1975.00021962006700010027x3Available from publisher's site 7aarticle03481naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002500148245016100173300001600334520173400350592002802084650002102112650002402133650002102157650001302178650001602191650001502207650001202222650002002234650003602254650002602290650001502316650002302331650001502354650001202369650001502381650001702396650001202413650001702425650001102442650002502453650001802478650001702496653002702513653002402540653002602564653000902590700001802599700006002617700002402677773012202701856008302823852000902906655001202915IND60752754620221122020445.0220118e202201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075275462DNAL7 a10.1016/j.sajb.2021.09.0252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKokkanti, Rekha Rani10aVariability in drought stress-induced physiological, biochemical responses and expression of DREB2A, NAC4 and HSP70 genes in groundnut (Arachis hypogaea L.)  ap. 448-457.  aDrought stress is one of the most important factors of physiological stress and the major constraint on crop productivity which limits plant growth and metabolism. The goal of this work was to study the differential response of groundnut genotypes to drought stress at the physiological, biochemical, and molecular levels during summer in the field. Thirty days old seedlings of six genotypes of groundnut viz. Kadiri 9, Narayani, Dharani, JL24, TPT-3, and Kadiri 6 were subjected to drought stress by withdrawing irrigation for 15 days. The results suggested a significant influence of drought stress on the physiological and biochemical levels in all the groundnut genotypes. A substantial decrease for physiological parameters viz. membrane stability index, chlorophyll stability index, and relative water content was observed under moderate and severe stress conditions compared to control across all genotypes. The high proline accumulating genotypes also exhibited lower lipid peroxidation under all stress periods. In Kadiri 9, Narayani, and Dharani genotypes, the antioxidant enzyme activity of superoxide dismutase, catalase, peroxidase, and glutathione reductase was significantly higher than JL24, TPT-3, and Kadiri 6 genotypes under all stress regimes. Among the genotypes tested, Kadiri 9, Narayani, and Dharani retained higher growth, yield, and seed quality characteristics showing tolerance for drought stress. qPCR analysis revealed stress-responsive existence of the selected genes, heat shock protein 70 (HSP70), dehydration-responsive element binding-2A (DREB2A), and no apical meristem, ATAF1/2, cup-shaped cotyledon 2 (NAC4) with 30 fold increase in the level of expression in Kadiri 9 compared to Kadiri 6.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArachis hypogaea 3aantioxidant enzymes 3aapical meristems 3acatalase 3achlorophyll 3acotyledons 3adrought 3aenzyme activity 3aglutathione-disulfide reductase 3aheat-shock protein 70 3airrigation 3alipid peroxidation 3ametabolism 3apeanuts 3aperoxidase 3aplant growth 3aproline 3aseed quality 3asummer 3asuperoxide dismutase 3awater content 3awater stress 0aRelative water content 0aHeat shock proteins 0aTranscription factors 0aqPCR1 aVemuri, Hindu1 aGaddameedi, Anil1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6049-71061 aRayalacheruvu, Usha0 tSouth African journal of botany.g2022 Jan., v. 144 p.448-457dElsevier B.V.aSAABwJournal:jnl34108x0254-62997nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.sajb.2021.09.0253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03332naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001500144245007400159300002000233500001500253520182900268592002802097650001402125650001302139650001402152650000902166650001902175650002102194650001102215650001502226650001102241650001102252650001102263650001202274650001302286650001602299650001302315650001102328650001402339650003102353650001302384650001102397653001402408653001902422653002802441653002002469653000902489653001602498700001902514700001702533773012902550856007802679852000902757655001202766IND60528341320221118011624.0160716e20150708xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052834132DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.5b037292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLing, Chen10aQuantum Chemical Design of Doped Ca2MnAlO5+δ as Oxygen Storage Media  ap. 14518-14527.  a2019-12-06  aBrownmillerite Ca₂MnAlO₅ has an exceptional capability to robustly adsorb half-molecules of oxygen and form Ca₂MnAlO₅.₅. To utilize this unique property to regulate oxygen-involved reactions, it is crucial to match the oxygen release–intake equilibrium with targeted reaction conditions. Here we perform a comprehensive investigation of the strategy of tuning the oxygen storage property of Ca₂MnAlO₅ through chemical doping. For undoped Ca₂MnAlO₅₊δ, our first-principles calculation predicts that the equilibrium temperature at a pressure of 1 atm of O₂ is 848 K, which is in excellent agreement with experimental results. Furthermore, the doping of alkaline earth ions at the Ca site, trivalent ions at the Al site, and 3d transition metal ions at the Mn site is analyzed. By the doping of 12.5% of Ga, V, and Ti, the equilibrium temperature shifts to high values by approximately 110–270 K, while by the doping of 12.5% of Fe, Sr, and Ba, the equilibrium temperature is lowered by approximately 20–210 K. The doping of these elements is thermodynamically stable, and doping other elements including Mg, Sc, Y, Cr, Co, and Ni generates metastable compounds. The doping of a higher content of Fe, however, lowers the oxygen storage capacity. Finally, on the basis of our calculated data, we prove that the formation energetics of nondilute interacting oxygen vacancy in doped Ca₂MnAlO₅.₅ scale linearly with a simple descriptor, the oxygen p-band position relative to the Fermi level. The higher-oxygen p-band position leads to a lower vacancy formation energy and thus a lower oxygen release temperature. Understanding such a relationship between fundamental quantum chemical properties and macroscopic properties paves the road to the design and optimization of novel functional oxides.  aPublisher supplied data 3amanganese 3atitanium 3astrontium 3airon 3athermodynamics 3asuperoxide anion 3abarium 3ametal ions 3aoxygen 3acobalt 3aenergy 3acalcium 3avanadium 3atemperature 3achromium 3aoxides 3amagnesium 3aphysicochemical properties 3aaluminum 3anickel 0aCa2MnAlO5 0abrownmillerite 0aoxygen storage material 0achemical doping 0aions 0aCa2MnAlO5.51 aZhang, Ruigang1 aJia, Hongfei0 tACS applied materials .g2015 July 08, v. 7, no. 26 p.14518-14527dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.5b037293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02541naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001700144245012400161300002000285520112700305592002801432650001701460650001701477650001001494650001901504650001301523650001901536650002601555653002601581653001701607653001601624653001701640653001501657653002301672700001801695700001601713700001301729700001901742700001201761700001701773700001801790700001701808700001801825773012901843856007801972852000902050655001202059IND60528341420221118011724.0160716e20150708xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052834142DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.5b037492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Haobin10aCovalent Patterning and Rapid Visualization of Latent Fingerprints with Photo-Cross-Linkable Semiconductor Polymer Dots  ap. 14477-14484.  aFingerprint imaging and recognition represent the most important approach in personal identification. Here we designed and synthesized oxetane-functionalized semiconductor polymer dots (Ox-Pdots) for covalent patterning and rapid visualization of latent fingerprints. The high fluorescence brightness, large Stokes shift, and excellent surface properties of the Ox-Pdots lead to fingerprint imaging with high sensitivity and resolution. Fingerprint ridge structures with the first, second, and third levels of details were clearly developed within minutes. The method was facile and robust for visualization of fingerprints on various surfaces including glass, metal, and plastics. Moreover, the oxetane groups in the Ox-Pdots undergo cross-linking reactions induced by a short-time UV irradiation, yielding 3-D intermolecular polymer network. The resulting fingerprint patterns exhibit unparalleled stability against rigorous treatment, as compared to those by traditional Pdots. Our results demonstrate that the Ox-Pdots hold great promise for latent fingerprint imaging and fluorescence anticounterfeiting applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3acrosslinking 3afluorescence 3aglass 3aimage analysis 3aplastics 3asemiconductors 3aultraviolet radiation 0asemiconductor polymer 0ananoparticle 0afingerprint 0afluorescence 0apatterning 0aanticounterfeiting1 aChang, Kaiwen1 aMen, Xiaoju1 aSun, Kai1 aFang, Xiaofeng1 aMa, Chi1 aZhao, Yongxi1 aYin, Shengyan1 aQin, Weiping1 aWu, Changfeng0 tACS applied materials .g2015 July 08, v. 7, no. 26 p.14477-14484dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.5b037493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03544naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100005600151245015100207506011700358506007600475520178200551592002802333506003702361650001702398650001702415650001202432650001902444650002202463650001502485650002502500650001902525650000902544650001702553651001002570651001802580653002502598653001702623653002302640653002202663653003002685653002702715653002402742700001802766700001402784700001402798700001802812773010102830856008602931852000903017655001203026IND60766473020221207140519.0220606e202203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076647302DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecolind.2022.1086392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOu, Xiaoyang1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4875-266910aIntegrated multi-hazard risk to social-ecological systems with green infrastructure prioritization: A case study of the Yangtze River Delta, China  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe sustainable future of deltas is increasingly threatened due to natural ecosystem degradation and increasing climate change hazards. Thus, the spatial prioritization of Green Infrastructure (GI) is of great importance for ecosystem conservation and climate adaptation. The existing GI prioritization methods in deltaic regions lack a systematic method of incorporating the state of vulnerability and risk. In this study, a novel method was developed for systematically prioritizing GI management zones based on the biodiversity and ecosystem services that addresses the clear relevance to multi-hazard risk to the social-ecological system (SES). The approach was demonstrated in the Yangtze River Delta, China. The multi-hazard risk to the SES in the county-level administrative regions was evaluated based on the Global Delta Risk Index (GDRI). The outputs were then transferred into a critical cost factor in a combined spatial prioritization of the biodiversity and ecosystem services using the Marxan with Zones software to determine the spatial priorities of multiple management zones (the core zone, conservation zone, and sustainable use zone). Two comparative scenarios were run to illustrate how the inclusion of the multi-hazard risk can affect the spatial prioritization of GI. Based on our results, integrating the multi-hazard risk of the SES can effectively coordinate the configuration of GI management zones. This supports our conclusion that the risk to the SES should always be considered during future GI prioritization to ensure the GI network s resilience to multiple climatic changes. Our proposed framework will help guide future applications of GI in global deltas and the implementation of flexible conservation management in a multi-hazard context.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abiodiversity 3acase studies 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3acomputer software 3aecosystems 3agreen infrastructure 3aprioritization 3arisk 3ariver deltas 3aChina 3aYangtze River 0aGreen infrastructure 0aBiodiversity 0aEcosystem services 0aMulti-hazard risk 0aSocial- ecological system 0aSpatial prioritization 0aYangtze River Delta1 aLyu, Yingshuo1 aLiu, Yang1 aZheng, Xi1 aLi, Fangzheng0 tEcological indicators.g2022 Mar., v. 136 p.108639-dElsevier LtdwJournal:6196x1470-160X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2022.1086393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03141naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002700151245014500178300001600323520163100339592002801970650002401998650002902022650002002051650001002071650001802081650001902099650002602118650001102144650001302155650002602168653001902194653001202213653002702225653002202252653002002274653004302294700002502337700001802362700001802380700001702398700002302415700003002438773009702468856008502565852000902650655001202659IND60546805820221117230648.0160903e20140615xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054680582DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2013.09.0172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCerutti, Alessandro K.10aLife cycle assessment application in the fruit sector: State of the art and recommendations for environmental declarations of fruit products  ap. 125-135.  aModern food production is very diverse with high levels of specialisation and complexity. These features inevitably reflect on methods in the application of LCA to food products and agro-systems. System boundaries, functional units, allocation procedures and several other aspects contribute to there being substantial differentiation in the structure of LCA applications in fruit production systems, leading to significantly different results. Indeed, although scientific literature on the topic is recent and not particularly extensive, there are already many different ways of conducting LCAs in orchards.The aim of this paper is to propose a framework for selecting the best parameters for an LCA application in fruit production systems according to the objective of the study. This has been achieved by reviewing the scientific and technical literature on the topic. In particular papers from international journals and conference proceedings have been considered and the review has covered all main aspects for conducting an LCA in fruit production systems. The particular characteristics considered were objectives, system boundaries, the product considered, the functional unit, data origin and the environmental impact assessment method used.A substantial part of the paper is devoted to the modelling of the orchard, as this is key to a reliable application of any impact assessment approach. Rather than merely describing the theoretical model, this paper presents concrete recommendations about how to build the orchard system for LCA application avoiding over or under-estimations of the different orchard stages.  aPublisher supplied data 3aapplication methods 3aenvironmental assessment 3afood production 3afoods 3afruit growing 3afruit products 3alife cycle assessment 3amodels 3aorchards 3aproduction technology 0aFruit products 0aOrchard 0aSustainable production 0aSystem boundaries 0aFunctional unit 0aSystem modelling for impact assessment1 aBeccaro, Gabriele L.1 aBruun, Sander1 aBosco, Simona1 aDonno, Dario1 aNotarnicola, Bruno1 aBounous, G.q(Giancarlo),0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2014 June 15, v. 73 p.125-135dElsevier Ltdx0959-65267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2013.09.0173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02869naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245009400167300001400261520143300275592002801708650001301736650001601749650001101765650001401776650001701790650001501807650001501822650001201837650001401849650004301863650000901906650001301915650001301928650002101941653001501962653001301977653001801990653001102008653001202019700002102031700002102052700001802073700002002091700002502111700002402136773010002160856008202260852000902342655001202351IND60112693320221117220948.0190415e201301  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011269332DNAL7 a10.1016/j.hal.2012.11.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFurlan, Michela10aMolecular identification of Ostreopsis cf. ovata in filter feeders and putative predators  ap. 20-29.  aOstreopsis ovata Fukuyo is a benthic dinoflagellate widespread from tropical to subtropical and warm temperate coastal areas world-wide. Since the species produces palytoxin-like substances that can accumulate in seafood, the apparent expansion of its range in recent years represents an increasing risk for human health. This leads to the necessity of monitoring protocols that enable the rapid detection of the presence of this microalga in environmental samples and sea-food. We developed an identification protocol based on real-time PCR (qPCR) to detect O. cf. ovata presence in different matrices. The protocol was proved to be able to reveal microalgal traces in both soft tissues and intervalvar liquid of mussels exposed to O. cf. ovata in natural and experimental conditions as well as in seawater samples. O. cf. ovata could also be detected in mussel tissues after the end of the bloom, when it was no longer detectable in sea water. We were able to detect O. cf. ovata in copepods fed on unialgal cultures as well. Cell density estimates based on standard curves resulted to be comparable to direct microscopical counts. The method is therefore suitable to ascertain the origin of palytoxin-like substances in toxic seafood. In addition, our results confirm that mussels and other predators can actually ingest O. cf. ovata cells and act as a vector for toxin transfer through both benthic and planktonic food webs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCopepoda 3aDinophyceae 3acoasts 3afood webs 3ahuman health 3amicroalgae 3amonitoring 3amussels 3apredators 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3arisk 3aseafoods 3aseawater 3atoxic substances 0aOstreopsis 0aToxicity 0aReal-time PCR 0aMussel 0aCopepod1 aAntonioli, Marta1 aZingone, Adriana1 aSardo, Angela1 aBlason, Claudia1 aPallavicini, Alberto1 aFonda Umani, Serena0 tHarmful algae.g2013 Jan., v. 21-22 p.20-29dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl3946763x1568-98837nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.hal.2012.11.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03049naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002500153245012100178300001800299520157000317592002801887650001201915650001401927650002601941650002501967650002001992650001502012650002002027650001702047650001802064650003102082650001102113650001502124650001802139650002502157650001402182651001102196700002102207700002102228700002602249700002602275700006302301773011902364856008702483852000902570655001202579IND60637504820221117191258.0190418e20190219xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063750482DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.energyfuels.8b042302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSiqueira, Adriano F.10aAssessing Waste Cooking Oils for the Production of Quality Biodiesel Using an Electronic Nose and a Stochastic Model  ap. 3221-3226.  aAround 1% of waste cooking oil (WCO) is currently recycled to make biodiesel in Brazil, mainly because used oils can acquire physicochemical characteristics that render them unsuitable as raw materials. To make biofuel production from waste oils and fats more efficient and economically feasible, it is important to develop simple, rapid, and low-cost methods for testing the quality of WCOs. With the objective of establishing the applicability of stochastic modeling of e-nose profiles in assessing the suitability of WCO for biodiesel production, the synthesized biodiesel samples from 36 pre-used frying oils, obtained from domestic and commercial premises, were analyzed regarding ester content, acidity index, density, viscosity, and iodine index. Olfactory profiles of the WCO sources were obtained using a Cyranose chemical vapor-sensing instrument and interpreted by application of stochastic modeling and quadratic discriminant analysis. The predictive model obtained by stochastic analysis exclusively from the olfactory profiles of the samples of WCO allowed the latter to be classified according to their ability to generate biodiesel that would be compliant with standard specifications and with an overall accuracy greater than 80%. Our results demonstrated that stochastic modeling is a promising tool for predicting the quality of biodiesel based only on the WCO olfactory profiles and its origin, since it allows qualitative assessments of the principal biodiesel properties and eliminates the need for complex and time-consuming laboratory tests.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacidity 3abiodiesel 3adiscriminant analysis 3aeconomic feasibility 3aelectronic nose 3afrying oil 3afuel production 3aiodine value 3akitchen waste 3alaboratory experimentation 3alipids 3aprediction 3araw materials 3astochastic processes 3aviscosity 3aBrazil1 aVidigal, Igor G.1 aMelo, Mariana P.1 aGiordani, Domingos S.1 aBatista, Pollyanna S.1 aFerreira, Ana L.

Their innervation patterns in the flexor muscles were studied by applying anterograde neurobiotin tracings via these nerves. The labeled neurons are clustered in eight groups in the cerebral ganglion. They send both common and distinct innervation pathways to the flexor and the tegumental muscles and to the tentacular retractor muscle. The common pathway reaches the muscles via the olfactory nerve, whereas the distinct pathways innervate via the internal and external peritentacular nerves. The three anchoring points of the three flexor muscles at the base of the tentacle outline the directions of three force vectors generated by the contraction of the muscles and enable the protracted tentacle to bend around a basal pivot. In the light of earlier physiological and the present anatomical findings, we suggest that the common innervation pathway to the muscles is required for tentacle withdrawal and the retractor mechanism, whereas the distinct pathways primarily serve the bending of the protracted posterior tentacles during foraging.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHelix pomatia 3acobalt 3aforaging 3aganglia 3ainnervation 3amuscles 3anerve tissue 3aneurons 3asnails 2aAnimals 2aHelix, Snails. 2aMusclesxanatomy & histologyxinnervation. 2aNeuronsxphysiology 2aOlfactory Pathwaysxphysiology1 aTeyke, Thomas0 tCell and tissue research.g2013 May, v. 352, no. 2 p.217-225dSpringer-Verlagx0302-766X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00441-013-1553-6  aDNAL 7aarticle02045naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100005600152245008000208520100700288592002801295650001001323650002001333650001301353650001501366650001201381653002701393653001301420653001701433653001701450653001101467700002201478773011101500856008701611852000901698655001201707IND60752754820221122034054.0211106e202203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075275482DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jfoodeng.2021.1108382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOtero, Laura1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1636-326310aEffects of the application of static magnetic fields during potato freezing  aThe effectiveness of static magnetic fields (SMFs) in improving food freezing is a topic that, nowadays, raises substantial controversy among the scientific community. To shed light on this matter, new freezing experiments, under well controlled conditions, were performed in potato samples subjected or not to SMFs of either 40–55 mT or 150–200 mT, that is, approximately 1000 and 5000 times greater than the Earth's magnetic field, respectively. Our results showed that these SMFs did not affect supercooling, freezing kinetics, or potato quality. Thus, the supercooling reached before nucleation, the duration of the precooling, phase change, and tempering steps, the characteristic and total freezing times, drip losses, texture, and color were similar in potato samples frozen with or without SMF application. More experiments, at higher SMF intensities and in foods of different composition, should be performed to definitively evaluate the effectiveness of SMFs in improving food freezing.  aPublisher supplied data 3acolor 3amagnetic fields 3apotatoes 3aprecooling 3atexture 0aStatic magnetic fields 0aFreezing 0aSupercooling 0aFood quality 0aPotato1 aPozo C., Alberto,0 tJournal of food engineering.g2022 Mar., v. 316 p.110838-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl34294x0260-87747nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jfoodeng.2021.1108383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02006naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001500147245012500162300001600287520094900303592002801252650002501280650001401305650002001319650001701339650001301356650001601369700001401385700001601399700001601415700001501431773009701446856008101543990002301624852000901647655001201656IND60093202620221118031726.0141103e20130101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009320262DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cej.2012.10.0332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Gang10aPVP-assisted assembly of lanthanum carbonate hydroxide with hierarchical architectures and their luminescence properties  ap. 386-393.  aIn the presence of polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP), three-dimensional (3D) hierarchical nest-like architecture of lanthanum carbonate hydroxide (LaOHCO₃) with uniform size is successfully synthesized by a facile hydrothermal process using La(NO₃)₃ as the starting material. The result indicates that LaOHCO₃ microspheres are constructed layer-by-layer from a large number of two-dimensional plates, which are composed of numerous nanorods with a length of ∼50nm. The formation mechanism is discussed on the basis of the result of a time-dependent experiment. It is demonstrated that PVP played an important role in the formation of the hierarchical structure. The room temperature photoluminescence properties of the LaOHCO₃ with different morphologies and size are investigated, showing that the nest-like LaOHCO₃ exhibits a relative stronger luminescence intensity at 420nm than the synthesized rod- and apple-like LaOHCO₃ samples.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical engineering 3alanthanum 3alight intensity 3aluminescence 3ananorods 3atemperature1 aWang, Hui1 aBai, Jintao1 aRen, Zhaoyu1 aBai, Jinbo0 tChemical engineering journal.g2013 Jan. 1, v. 214 p.386-393dElsevier B.V.x1385-89477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cej.2012.10.0333Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02731naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245015500169300001800324520136100342592002801703650001201731650002401743650001301767650001101780650002101791650001501812650001701827650001401844650001301858650002101871650001801892653001301910653002101923653001901944653003501963653001901998653002702017700002802044773013102072856008502203852000902288655001202297IND60559276620221120134946.0161205e20161205xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055927662DNAL7 a10.1021/acssuschemeng.6b013142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJung, Sungyup10aElectrocatalytic Hydrogenation and Hydrogenolysis of Furfural and the Impact of Homogeneous Side Reactions of Furanic Compounds in Acidic Electrolytes  ap. 6500-6508.  aThe electrochemical hydrogenation and hydrogenolysis (ECH) of furfural (FF) on a copper electrocatalyst has been investigated to produce biofuels and fine chemicals in an H-type batch reactor at room temperature. We report a systematic study of ECH of FF to gain a better understanding of the relationships between products and reaction conditions: current density, electrolyte, and cosolvent ratio in acidic solutions. The acidity of electrolytes had the most significant impact on the product distribution. Mildly acidic electrolytes mainly produced furfuryl alcohol (FA), while strongly acidic electrolytes produced both 2-methyl furan (MF) and FA. Also, the yield of products depended on the current density and reaction time when equivalent charge was transferred to the reaction. However, the mole balance accounting for FF, MF, and FA was not higher than 70% in any reaction condition when the theoretical amount of electrons for complete MF production from FF (e–/FF = 4) was transferred to the system. The investigation of nonelectrochemical homogeneous side reactions suggested that the low mole balance in a mildly acidic electrolyte may be from the charge transfer promoted side reactions on the copper electrode. On the other hand, it was shown that the low mole balance in strongly acidic electrolytes was due to homogeneous side reactions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacidity 3aambient temperature 3abiofuels 3acopper 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3aelectrolytes 3aelectrons 3afurfural 3afurfuryl alcohol 3ahydrogenation 0aFurfural 0aFurfuryl alcohol 0a2-Methyl furan 0aElectrocatalytic hydrogenation 0aHydrogenolysis 0aCopper electrocatalyst1 aBiddinger, Elizabeth J.0 tACS sustainable chemistry .g2016 Dec. 05, v. 4, no. 12 p.6500-6508dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23317x2168-04857nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acssuschemeng.6b013143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03190naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245008200172300001600254520171000270592002801980650000802008650002102016650001402037650000902051650001602060650002202076650001802098650001402116650002902130650000902159650001302168650001602181650001502197650001702212650002402229650001202253650001602265651001402281653002202295653002602317653001102343653002502354700003802379700001702417700001802434700001702452773009702469856008502566852000902651655001202660IND60546806120221117230641.0160903e20141215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054680612DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2013.09.0252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMardookhy, Minoo12aA study of energy efficiency in residential buildings in Knoxville, Tennessee  ap. 241-249.  aEnergy efficiency is an essential aspect in the design and operation of residential buildings. Residential energy consumption is shown to account for approximately 8% of the electricity and 3.5% of the natural gas consumption in the U.S. The heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) system and lighting system are two major factors influencing energy consumption in residential buildings. About 52–72% of the average energy consumed by residential buildings is used to keep buildings at comfortable temperatures, provide hot water, and circulate fresh air indoors. In the service region of the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA), 92% of the electricity is non-renewable electricity, and approximately 41% is generated by coal. Therefore, energy consumption in residential buildings directly relates to the proportion of pollutants and greenhouse gas emissions from the power plants. With the development of advanced technology and strict energy policies, however, the energy consumption in the residential sector and the corresponding emission of pollutants can be significantly reduced.This study presents an approach for analyzing the energy efficiency metrics in residential buildings based on three dimensions: sustainable physical infrastructure, energy efficient equipment, and energy efficient behavior. The results of this analysis subsequently provide a residential building system with a strategy for conversion to cleaner energy sources by identifying opportunities in each of the three primary dimensions. For this study, energy consumption data for each of the metrics are collected by a survey of 102 participating residential buildings in Knoxville, Tennessee in the United States.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3aair conditioning 3abuildings 3acoal 3aelectricity 3aenergy efficiency 3aenergy policy 3aequipment 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3aheat 3alighting 3anatural gas 3apollutants 3apower plants 3aresidential housing 3asurveys 3atemperature 3aTennessee 0aEnergy efficiency 0aResidential buildings 0aSurvey 0aStatistical analysis1 aSawhney, R.

The as-prepared COE NPs take advantage of the structure of POSS and the optical properties of the pendant groups, OPVE. Confocal laser scanning microscopy showed strong photoluminescence of the stained cells, indicating spontaneous accumulation of COE NPs within cell membranes. Moreover, the electrochemical performance of the COE NPs is superior to that of an established membrane intercommunicating COE, DSSN+ in increasing current generation, suggesting that these COE NPs thus hold great potential to boost the performance of MFCs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3acell membranes 3aconfocal laser scanning microscopy 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrolytes 3amicrobial fuel cells 3ananoparticles 3aoptical properties 3aphotoluminescence 0aconjugated oligoelectrolyte (COE) 0ananoparticles 0apolyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxanes (POSS) 0acurrent generation 0amicrobial fuel cells1 aChen, Jia1 aDing, Yuanzhao1 aWang, Victor

Treatments included 0–10, 10–40, 40–70, and 70–100% of DF trees, with 0–10, 10–40, 40–70, and 70–100% of DF + IP trees. The hailstorms increased the damages to shoots for peaches and to shoots and scaffold for Japanese apricot trees in year 1, with fruit yield reduced more than 80% observed on 10–100 DF of both fruit species. The IP treatment increased the number of new shoots in years 2–4 but reduced shoot length and diameter of peach and Japanese apricot trees. Tree canopy in years 2–4 was reduced on 40–100 DF of peach trees and on 70–100 of DF and DF + IP of Japanese apricot trees. The 40–100 DF Japanese apricot trees resulted in a fruit yield index of less than 90% for years 2–4, which was observed on 40–100 DF+IP trees only in year 2 due to balanced tree vegetative and reproductive growth.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPrunus mume 3aPrunus persica 3aagronomy 3acanopy 3adefoliation 3afruit yield 3afruits 3apeaches 3astorms 3aSouth Korea1 aCho, Hye-sŭng,1 aCho, Kyung-Chul 1 aKim, Hyo-jung,1 aLee, BoBae,1 aGu, Mengmeng 1 aChoi, Hyun-Sug 0 tAgronomy.g2021 Oct. 28, v. 11, no. 11dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:12361x2073-43957nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agronomy111121783Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04073naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001200151245013300163506010400296506007600400520248400476592002802960506003702988650001703025650001503042650002503057650002903082650003103111650001103142650001403153650002203167650001703189650001903206651001003225653002703235653002903262653003903291653001403330700001503344700001703359700001703376700001403393773010103407856008603508852000903594655001203603IND60766473520221207143754.0220606e202203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076647352DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecolind.2022.1086442doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Yu13aAn approach to assess spatio-temporal heterogeneity of rural ecosystem health: A case study in Chongqing mountainous area, China  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aRural ecosystem health is an effective metrics of the stable state of rural components and subsystems referring to the ability to meet the reasonable needs of human society, self-maintain and update the ecosystem. With the development of regional ecosystem assessment, the theoretical breakthrough demand to integrate ecosystem composition integrity and ecosystem services (ES) supply–demand from the perspective of coupled human and ecosystem into ecosystem health assessment is increasing, stakeholders are interested in improving some comprehensive evaluation framework to reverse inadequate understanding of focusing on the single measurement of rural natural ecosystem status and external disturbance. This study established an improved rural ecosystem health assessment framework (REH-SD) with integrating ecological integrity and ES supply–demand from the perspective of social-economy-natural complex ecosystem, which put forward a set of assessment index system combining with SDGs17 indicators, and took Chongqing as a case study to reveal quantitatively spatiotemporal heterogeneity characteristics of rural ecosystem health. The results shown that: 1) The comprehensive score of rural ecosystem health in Chongqing from 2008 to 2018 was formed into an obvious variation evolutionary rule of gentle wave first and then rising rapidly ranging from 0.618 to 0.885, which was consistent with the trend of the physical state of rural ecosystem health (PREH); 2) The rural ecosystem health of 36 districts and counties in Chongqing increased gradually from the west Chongqing and metropolitan areas to the northeast and southeast Chongqing on the whole, showing a spatial heterogeneity of central and western collapse, northeast wings high, local protrusion, and the unhealth type (33.33%) and subhealth type (27.78%) dominated throughout the study area in 2018; 3) The improved REH-SD framework could appropriately modify the traditional evaluation results according to supply and demand relationship, the serious ecological deficit in metropolitan areas aggravated dramatically the deterioration of rural ecosystem, inversely, the REH-SD was significantly affected by the PREH in northeast and southeast Chongqing. The improved REH-SD framework was verified to be advanced comparing with the traditional evaluation method, and our results could provide significant differentiated recommendations for mountain ecological environment protection and restoration project.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acase studies 3aecosystems 3aenvironmental health 3aenvironmental protection 3ahealth effects assessments 3ahumans 3amountains 3aspatial variation 3astakeholders 3asupply balance 3aChina 0aRural ecosystem health 0aSpatiotemporal evolution 0aEcosystem services supply–demand 0aChongqing1 aYang, Chun1 aTan, Shaohua1 aZhou, Hantao1 aZeng, Wei0 tEcological indicators.g2022 Mar., v. 136 p.108644-dElsevier LtdwJournal:6196x1470-160X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2022.1086443Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02289naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001600153245010400169300001800273520102600291592002801317650004401345650001501389650001501404650001501419650001901434650001001453650001001463650002101473650001101494650001901505650001601524700005701540700001401597700001801611700001701629700001801646773011901664856008701783852000901870655001201879IND60637505220221117195717.0190418e20190226xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063750522DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.energyfuels.8b042782doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Peiyu10aDevelopment of Amine-Functionalized Silica Foams with Hierarchical Pore Structure for CO₂ Capture  ap. 3357-3369.  aA novel mesocellular silica foam (MCF) support were synthesized, which has different pore volumes and two different sizes of windows on the spherical cells. Tetraethylenepentamine (TEPA)-functionalized MCF adsorbents were then prepared for CO₂ capture. The effects of support structure, capture temperature, SO₂, and NO₂ on the CO₂ capture were investigated. The results show that the hierarchical window structure can improve the dispersion of amine species in the silica foams. In situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy results indicate that more adsorption sites can be exposed in the pores at high temperature for CO₂ capture. The MCF-TEPA60% has the optimal capture amount of 4.75 mmol/g with 15 vol % CO₂ at 75 °C. The SO₂ and NO₂ have a negative influence on the adsorption and regeneration properties of adsorbent due to the production of byproducts.

No data of this nature is available hi turfgrass literature. Species differences were noted for verdure, shoot density, leaf width, load bearing capacity, leaf tensile strength, percent moisture, and percent relative turgidity. However, no significant correlations were found between species wear tolerance and the afore mentioned characteristics. Analysis of the combined relationship of these factors to wear tolerance indicated that only leaf tensile strength and leaf width contributed significantly to the variation in turfgrass wear tolerance among seven turfgrass species. Sclerenchyma tissue and lignified cell comparisons were made between Kentucky 31 tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea Schreb.) and rough bluegrass (Poa trivialis L.). Results were presented as percent of the total cross-sectional area of leaf blades and stems. Sclerenchyma tissues of Kentucky 31 composed 18.6% of leaves and 23.4% of stems, while the contents of rough bluegrass were 8.9 and 10.3%, respectively. The percent lignified cells of Kentucky 31 tall fescue and rough bluegrass were 49.8 and 21.4%, respectively, based on total leaf cross-sectional area. The percent Sclerenchyma fibers and lignified cells were closely associated with the wear tolerance observed for the two species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFestuca arundinacea 3aPoa trivialis 3ainterspecific variation 3aleaf blade 3aleaf width 3asclerenchyma 3astems 3atensile strength 3aturf grasses1 aBeard, J.

Problems associated with wax formation and deposition are a major concern in production and transportation of hydrocarbon fluids. Thus, testing of wax disappearance temperature (WDT) is essential in high-efficiency development of crude oil. For the sake of reduction of time and improvement of accuracy, four metaheuristic models called gray wolf optimizer-based support vector machine (GWO-SVM), least-squares support vector machine, genetic algorithm-based adaptive network-based fuzzy inference system, and particle swarm optimization-based adaptive network-based fuzzy inference system were used for the prediction of WDT in binary, ternary, and multicomponent systems in the range of 0.1–100 MPa. The input parameters are molar mass and pressure, and the output is the WDT at every point. The comparison between the four models shows that the GWO-SVM gets the best accordance with experimental data sets with the minimum average absolute relative deviation (AARD = 0.7128%), maximum determination coefficient (R² = 0.9546), and minimum root-mean-squared error (RMSE = 2.4208) in all 272 data points. And outliers detection using the leverage approach to detect the doubt points, where only 6 data points in all 272 data points.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCanis lupus 3aalkanes 3adata collection 3aleast squares 3amodels 3amolecular weight 3apetroleum 3aprediction 3asupport vector machines 3atemperature1 aHuang, Jin-Hui1 aWang, Ying1 aLiu, Yong-Bing1 aKaushika Kasthuriarachchi, Don Thisal1 aHuang, Lin-Jun0 tEnergy & fuels.g2019 Feb. 28, v. 33, no. 4 p.2934-2949dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23338x1520-50297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.energyfuels.8b042863Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03332naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002100092024003300113040001800146100002500164245008100189300001800270500000900288520180300297592002802100650001302128650000902141650001602150650002002166650001902186650002502205650002202230650001502252650001602267650001802283650002002301650002102321650001602342650002002358650001702378650002802395650001302423650001802436651001302454700002102467773012402488852000902612856011202621856008002733961001302813655001202826IND4401157520221117160823.0191226e200711  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440115752DNAL7 a10113/149522hdl7 a10.2134/agronj2006.03562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHalvorson, Ardell D.10aIrrigated, No-Till Corn and Barley Response to Nitrogen in Northern Colorado  ap. 1521-1529.  aepub  aConverting irrigated, conventional-till (CT) systems to no-till (NT) production systems can potentially reduce soil erosion, fossil fuel consumption, and greenhouse gas emissions. Nitrogen fertilization effects on irrigated corn (Zea mays L.) and malting barley (Hordeum distichon L.) yields in a corn-barley rotation were evaluated for 6 yr on a clay loam soil to determine the viability of using a NT system and N needs for optimum crop yield. Six N treatments were established with N rates varying from 0 to 224 kg N ha⁻¹ for corn and 0 to 112 kg N ha⁻¹ for barley. Corn and barley grain yields were significantly increased by N fertilization each of 3 yr in the rotation. Three year average corn grain yields were near maximum with an available N (AN) (soil + fertilizer + irrigation water N) level of 274 kg N ha⁻¹ Barley yields increased linearly with increasing N rate with grain protein content near 130 kg protein Mg⁻¹ grain at the highest N rate. Nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) by corn and barley, based on grain N removal, decreased with increasing AN level and ranged from 204 to 39 and 68 to 31 kg grain kg⁻¹ AN for the low and high N treatments for corn and barley, respectively. Total plant N uptake required to produce one Mg grain at near maximum yield in this study averaged 21 kg N for corn and 27 kg N for barley. Corn and barley residue production increased with increasing N rate. Irrigated, NT corn yields obtained in this corn-barley rotation were acceptable (>10 Mg ha⁻¹) for northern Colorado; however, barley yields did not meet our expected yield goal of 5.4 Mg ha⁻¹ with the N rates used in this study, but grain protein was near maximum for malting barley. An irrigated, NT corn-barley production system appears to be feasible in northern Colorado.  aPublisher supplied data 3aZea mays 3acorn 3agrain crops 3aHordeum vulgare 3amalting barley 3anitrogen fertilizers 3airrigated farming 3ano-tillage 3agrain yield 3acrop rotation 3aclay loam soils 3airrigation water 3afertigation 3aprotein content 3acrop quality 3anutrient use efficiency 3anitrogen 3acrop residues 3aColorado1 aReule, Curtis A.0 tAgronomy journal.g2007 Nov., v. 99, no. 6 p.1521-1529dAmerican Society of AgronomywJournal:jnl44592x0002-19627nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/149523Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2134/agronj2006.03563Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle03736naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002300094024002200117024001900139040001800158100002100176245014100197300001500338520200200353592002802355650002102383650001502404650001402419650003602433650001002469650001102479650001202490650004102502650001502543650001102558650001402569650001902583650001602602650001702618650003602635700002102671700002402692700002102716700002402737700002502761700002102786700001802807700001802825773015302843856007002996856009603066990002303162852000903185655001203194IND60608595920221118162932.0190510e20170913xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060859592DNAL7 a10.3791/563112doi7 aPMC57522532pmcid7 a289309822pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMercatali, Laura10aDevelopment of a human preclinical model of osteoclastogenesis from peripheral blood monocytes co-cultured with breast cancer cell lines  ap. e56311.  aThe crosstalk between tumor cells and bone cells in the bone microenvironment is crucial to understanding the mechanism of bone metastasis formation. We developed an in vitro fully human preclinical model of a co-culture of breast cancer cells and monocytes undergoing differentiation towards osteoclasts. We optimized a model of osteoclastogenesis starting from a sample of peripheral blood collected from healthy donors. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were first separated by density gradient centrifugation, seeded at a high density and induced to differentiate by adding two growth factors (GFs): receptor activator of nuclear factor-κB ligand (RANKL) and macrophage colony-stimulating factor (MCSF). The cells were left in culture for 14 days and then fixed and analyzed by downstream analysis. In osteolytic bone metastases, one of the effects of cancer cell arrival in bone is the induction of osteoclastogenesis. We thus challenged our model with co-cultures of breast cancer cells to study the differentiation power of cancer cells with respect to GFs. A straightforward way of studying cancer cell-osteoclast interaction is to perform indirect co-cultures based on the use of conditioned medium collected from breast cancer cell cultures and mixed with fresh medium. This mixture is then used to induce osteoclast differentiation. We also optimized a method of direct co-culture in which cancer cells and monocytes undergoing differentiation share the medium and exchange secreted factors. This is a significant improvement over the original indirect co-culture method as researchers can observe the reciprocal interactions of the two cell types and perform downstream analyses for both cancer cells and osteoclasts. This method enables us to study the effect of drugs on the metastatic bone microenvironment and to seed cell lines other than those derived from breast cancer. The model can also be used to study other diseases such as osteoporosis or other bone conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3abreast neoplasms 3acell lines 3acoculture 3adensity gradient centrifugation 3adrugs 3ahumans 3aligands 3amacrophage colony-stimulating factor 3ametastasis 3amodels 3amonocytes 3aneoplasm cells 3aosteoclasts 3aosteoporosis 3atranscription factor NF-kappa B1 aSpadazzi, Chiara1 aMiserocchi, Giacomo1 aLiverani, Chiara1 aDe Vita, Alessandro1 aBongiovanni, Alberto1 aRecine, Federica1 aAmadori, Dino1 aIbrahim, Toni0 tJournal of visualized experiments.g2017 Sept. 13, , no. 127 p.e56311-e56311dJournal of Visualized ExperimentswJournal:jnl4469330x1940-087X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3791/563113Available from publisher's site  uhttp://www.jove.com/video/56311/development-human-preclinical-model-osteoclastogenesis-from  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03392naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024003500133040001800168100002700186245011100213300001600324506007600340520145800416592002801874506003701902650002801939650001401967650001301981650002301994650001302017650002502030650003402055650001202089650004802101650003402149650003602183650004702219650001602266650003702282650002602319650003502345650002402380650004502404650003402449650004202483650003402525650001302559650003302572650003402605700002102639773010902660856004802769852000902817655001202826IND4484439220221207054430.0120323e201204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448443922DNAL7 a221987422pmid7 aPMC33102692pmcid7 a10.1007/s00359-011-0705-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSimmons, Andrea Megela10aParticle motion is broadly represented in the vestibular medulla of the bullfrog across larval development  ap. 253-266.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aIn their shallow-water habitats, bullfrog (Rana catesbeiana) tadpoles are exposed to both underwater and airborne sources of acoustic stimulation. We probed the representation of underwater particle motion throughout the tadpole’s dorsal medulla to determine its spatial extent over larval life. Using neurobiotin-filled micropipettes, we recorded neural activity to z-axis particle motion (frequencies of 40–200 Hz) in the medial vestibular nucleus, lateral vestibular nucleus, dorsal medullary nucleus (DMN), and along the dorsal arcuate pathway. Sensitivity was comparable in the medial and lateral vestibular nuclei, with estimated thresholds between 0.016 and 12.5 μm displacement. Neither best responding frequency nor estimated threshold varied significantly over larval stage. Transport of neurobiotin from active recording sites was also stable over development. The DMN responded poorly to z-axis particle motion, but did respond to low-frequency pressure stimulation. These data suggest that particle motion is represented widely and stably in the tadpole’s vestibular medulla. This is in marked contrast to the representation of pressure stimulation in the auditory midbrain, where a transient “deaf period” of non-responsiveness and decreased connectivity occurs immediately prior to metamorphic climax. We suggest that, in bullfrogs, sensitivity to particle motion and to pressure follows different developmental trajectories.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aLithobates catesbeianus 3aacoustics 3ahabitats 3alarval development 3atadpoles 2aAcoustic Stimulation 2aAfferent Pathwaysxphysiology 2aAnimals 2aArcuate Nucleus of Hypothalamusxphysiology 2aAuditory Pathwaysxphysiology 2aAuditory Perceptionxphysiology 2aBiotinxanalogs & derivativesxmetabolism. 2aCalibration 2aData Interpretation, Statistical 2aElectrodes, Implanted 2aElectrophysiological Phenomena 2aHearingxphysiology 2aLarvaxgrowth & developmentxphysiology. 2aMedulla Oblongataxphysiology 2aMetamorphosis, Biologicalxphysiology 2aMotion Perceptionxphysiology 2aPressure 2aRana catesbeianaxphysiology 2aVestibular Nucleixphysiology1 aFlores, Victoria0 tJournal of comparative physiology.g2012 Apr., v. 198, no. 4 p.253-266dSpringer-Verlagx0340-75947nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00359-011-0705-y  aDNAL 7aarticle03473naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245020600170300001400376520192000390592002802310650002102338650001802359650001702377650003502394650001402429650002202443650001602465650001302481650001402494650001202508650002002520650001702540650001302557650001402570650001502584650001102599653004102610653002102651653002202672653001002694653001502704653002202719700001702741700002102758773009702779856008202876852000902958655001202967IND60112694220221117220832.0190415e201303  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011269422DNAL7 a10.1016/j.hal.2012.12.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNielsen, Lasse Tor10aProduction and excretion of okadaic acid, pectenotoxin-2 and a novel dinophysistoxin from the DSP-causing marine dinoflagellate Dinophysis acuta – Effects of light, food availability and growth phase  ap. 34-45.  aDiarrhetic shellfish poisoning (DSP) toxins constitute a severe economic threat to shellfish industries and a major food safety issue for shellfish consumers. The prime producers of the DSP toxins that end up in filter feeding shellfish are species of the marine mixotrophic dinoflagellate genus Dinophysis. Intraspecific toxin contents of Dinophysis spp. vary a lot, but the regulating factors of toxin content are still poorly understood. Dinophysis spp. have been shown to sequester and use chloroplasts from their ciliate prey, and with this rare mode of nutrition, irradiance and food availability could play a key role in the regulation of toxins contents and production. We investigated toxin contents, production and excretion of a Dinophysis acuta culture under different irradiances, food availabilities and growth phases. The newly isolated strain of D. acuta contained okadaic acid (OA), pectenotoxins-2 (PTX-2) and a novel dinophysistoxin (DTX) that we tentatively describe as DTX-1b isomer. We found that all three toxins were excreted to the surrounding seawater, and for OA and DTX-1b as much as 90% could be found in extracellular toxin pools. For PTX-2 somewhat less was excreted, but often >50% was found extracellularly. This was the case both in steady-state exponential growth and in food limited, stationary growth, and we emphasize the need to include extracellular toxins in future studies of DSP toxins. Cellular toxin contents were largely unaffected by irradiance, but toxins accumulated both intra- and extracellularly when starvation reduced growth rates of D. acuta. Toxin production rates were highest during exponential growth, but continued at decreased rates when cell division ceased, indicating that toxin production is not directly associated with ingestion of prey. Finally, we explore the potential of these new discoveries to shed light on the ecological role of DSP toxins.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDinophysis acuta 3acell division 3achloroplasts 3adiarrhetic shellfish poisoning 3aexcretion 3afood availability 3afood safety 3aindustry 3aingestion 3aisomers 3alight intensity 3aokadaic acid 3aseawater 3ashellfish 3astarvation 3atoxins 0aDiarrhetic shellfish poisoning (DSP) 0aDinophysis acuta 0aFood availability 0aLight 0aMixotrophy 0aOkadaic acid (OA)1 aKrock, Bernd1 aHansen, Per Juel0 tHarmful algae.g2013 Mar., v. 23 p.34-45dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl3946763x1568-98837nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.hal.2012.12.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02896naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100005700153245009100210300001800301520134500319592002801664650001801692650002201710650001201732650001201744650001201756650001101768650001401779650001101793650001501804650001001819650001701829650001301846650002401859650002301883650001201906650001501918650001701933650001301950650001901963650001501982650001301997650002202010650001402032650001602046700001902062700001402081700001602095700001602111773011902127856008702246852000902333655001202342IND60637505620221117195103.0190418e20190318xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063750562DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.energyfuels.8b042992doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Huiwen1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1960-251410aCharacteristics of Cyanobacterial Biomass Gasification in Sub- and Supercritical Water  ap. 3239-3247.  aHydrogen gas has been successfully produced from cultivated microalgae biomass by supercritical water gasification (SCWG). This paper describes SCWG of natural cyanobacterial biomass for hydrogen production at low temperatures (<500 °C). Natural decomposition of cyanobacteria biomass was first studied to achieve prospective H₂ production. Transformation of carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus and the degradation of microcystins were also clarified for the nature and safety assessment of SCWG products. Cyanobacteria would remain an ideal SCWG feedstock for H₂ production such as cultivated microalgae biomass, and it could be gasified as 2.92 mol/kg of H₂ yield without any catalyst addition at 500 °C. Liquid products with above 2800 mg/L ammonia-nitrogen and 100% removed microcystins had great potential for producing high-quality liquid fertilizers. C (50.50%) was concentrated into a solid residue as char and tar. The percentage of P combined with Ca²⁺ and turned into authigenic apatite was as high as 72.25%. The synergistic effects of ash, N element, or proteins, and fixed carbon content make cyanobacteria a more optimistic feedstock for H₂ production than some other types of organic wastes. The SCWG technology provides an effective method of gasification of waste cyanobacteria for high-value energy utilization.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCyanobacteria 3aammonium nitrogen 3aapatite 3abiomass 3acalcium 3acarbon 3acatalysts 3aenergy 3afeedstocks 3afuels 3agasification 3ahydrogen 3ahydrogen production 3aliquid fertilizers 3aliquids 3amicroalgae 3amicrocystins 3anitrogen 3aorganic wastes 3aphosphorus 3aproteins 3asafety assessment 3asynergism 3atemperature1 aZhang, Xiaoman1 aDing, Lei1 aMa, Jiangya1 aKong, Yanli0 tEnergy & fuels.g2019 Mar. 18, v. 33, no. 4 p.3239-3247dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23338x1520-50297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.energyfuels.8b042993Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02538naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100005600146245012200202300001600324520095200340592002801292650000801320650002501328650001401353650002001367650001301387650001701400650002101417650001801438650001301456650001501469650001301484653002001497653001301517653002301530653003101553653001901584700001401603700002001617700005501637700005801692700001501750700005701765773014501822856008001967852000902047655001202056IND60627137620221118022834.0190128e20181203xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062713762DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jafc.8b058742doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSun, Mingtai1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2424-228510aRapid and Visual Detection and Quantitation of Ethylene Released from Ripening Fruits: The New Use of Grubbs Catalyst  ap. 507-513.  aHerein, we report on fluorophore-tagged Grubbs catalysts as turn-on fluorescent probes for the sensitive detection and quantitation of ethylene, a plant hormone that plays a critical role in many phases of plant growth and fruit ripening. The ruthenium-based weak fluorescent probes were prepared handily through the metathesis reaction between the first-generation Grubbs catalyst and selected fluorophores that have high quantum yields and contain terminal vinyl groups. Upon exposure to ethylene, fluorescence enhancement was observed via the release of fluorophore from the probe. Our probe shows an excellent limit of detection for ethylene at 0.9 ppm in air and was successfully applied for monitoring ethylene released during the fruit-ripening process. Our work opens up a new avenue of application of Grubbs catalysts for bioanalytical chemistry of ethylene, which is critically important in plant biology, agriculture, and food industry.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3aanalytical chemistry 3acatalysts 3adetection limit 3aethylene 3afluorescence 3afluorescent dyes 3afood industry 3amoieties 3amonitoring 3aripening 0aGrubbs catalyst 0aethylene 0afluorescent probes 0aolefin metathesis reaction 0afruit ripening1 aYang, Xin1 aZhang, Yuannian1 aWang, Suhua1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8257-49371 aWong, Ming Wah1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2162-12201 aNi, Runyan1 aHuang, Dejian1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2305-39600 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2018 Dec. 03, v. 67, no. 1 p.507-513dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:12177x1520-51187nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jafc.8b058743Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03516naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100006600150245009200216520182600308592002802134650002302162650000802185650005202193650001102245650001702256650001402273650001202287650001002299650000902309650001102318650001302329650001802342650001302360650001802373650001302391650000902404650001002413650001002423650001402433653001302447653001502460653002202475653002202497700002602519700001802545700002702563700002602590700005502616700006002671700002102731773010402752856008502856852000902941655001202950IND60746506120221121122139.0220205e202201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074650612DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envres.2021.1118312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCuevas-Ferrando, Enric1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0799-009X10aDiscrimination of non-infectious SARS-CoV-2 particles from fomites by viability RT-qPCR  aThe ongoing coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic constitutes a concerning global threat to public health and economy. In the midst of this pandemic scenario, the role of environment-to-human COVID-19 spread is still a matter of debate because mixed results have been reported concerning SARS-CoV-2 stability on high-touch surfaces in real-life scenarios. Up to now, no alternative and accessible procedures for cell culture have been applied to evaluate SARS-CoV-2 infectivity on fomites. Several strategies based on viral capsid integrity have latterly been developed using viability markers to selectively remove false-positive qPCR signals resulting from free nucleic acids and damaged viruses. These have finally allowed an estimation of viral infectivity. The present study aims to provide a rapid molecular-based protocol for detection and quantification of viable SARS-CoV-2 from fomites based on the discrimination of non-infectious SARS-CoV-2 particles by platinum chloride (IV) (PtCl₄) viability RT-qPCR. An initial assessment compared two different swabbing procedures to recover inactivated SARS-CoV-2 particles from fomites coupled with two RNA extraction methods. Procedures were validated with human (E229) and porcine (PEDV) coronavirus surrogates, and compared with inactivated SARS-CoV-2 suspensions on glass, steel and plastic surfaces. The viability RT-qPCR efficiently removed the PCR amplification signals from heat and gamma-irradiated inactivated SARS-CoV-2 suspensions that had been collected from specified surfaces. This study proposes a rapid viability RT-qPCR that discriminates non-infectious SARS-CoV-2 particles on surfaces thus helping researchers to better understand the risk of contracting COVID-19 through contact with fomites and to develop more efficient epidemiological measures.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCOVID-19 infection 3aRNA 3aSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 3acapsid 3acell culture 3achlorides 3afomites 3aglass 3aheat 3ahumans 3apandemic 3apathogenicity 3aplatinum 3apublic health 3aresearch 3arisk 3asteel 3aswine 3aviability 0aCOVID-19 0aSARS-CoV-2 0aViability RT-qPCR 0aTransmission risk1 aGirón-Guzmán, Inés1 aFalcó, Irene1 aPérez-Cataluña, Alba1 aDíaz-Reolid, Azahara1 aAznar, Rosa1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8761-88871 aRandazzo, Walter1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7433-149X1 aSanchez, Gloria,0 tEnvironmental research.g2022 Jan., v. 203 p.111831-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12442x0013-93517nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2021.1118313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01500naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002300145245009800168300001800266520043000284592002800714650001200742650002300754650002300777650001300800650001300813650002200826650002100848650001400869700002100883700001600904700002100920773011900941856008101060852000901141655001201150IND60550448920221118034618.0160911e20150821xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055044892DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.joc.5b013742doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWilson, Robert J.,10aRuthenium Hydride Catalyzed Silylvinylation of Internal Alkynes Using Ethylene as an Additive  ap. 8290-8299.  aAn efficient synthetic strategy for the regiospecific silylvinylation of internal alkynes is described.

In this work, a ternary Ni–Al/CoOx-1 catalyst was fabricated, which provided 96% yield of DMF from in situ hydrodeoxygenation of HMF under mild reaction conditions. XRD, TEM and TPR revealed that the addition of Al to the Ni–Co bimetallic system could make the structure more stable and improve the dispersion of Ni and Co species. XPS, CO-DRIFTS and EPR verified that an enhanced electron transfer from Co species to Ni occurred on Ni–Al/CoOx-1. Reaction mechanism studies unraveled that the Al addition results in promoting in situ H₂ production from 2-propanol and accelerating the aldehyde group hydrogenation to a hydroxymethyl group and the subsequent hydrogenolysis into a methyl group, due to the formation of a charge separated metal-couple-site (Niᵟ⁻–Coᵟ⁺) and stronger Lewis acid sites in Ni–Al/CoOx-1. In addition, this ternary Ni–Al/CoOx-1 catalyst exhibits superior recyclability without significant loss of activity for 7 cycles.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLewis acids 3acatalysts 3aelectron transfer 3agreen chemistry 3ahydrogen 3ahydrogenation 3ahydroxymethylfurfural 3aisopropyl alcohol 3areaction mechanisms1 aNiu, Libo1 aAn, Yadan1 aBian, Gang1 aLi, Tianming1 aBai, Guoyi0 tGreen chemistry.g2021 Oct. 4, v. 23, no. 19 p.7763-7772dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26906x1463-92707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d1gc02758a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04241naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001400144245018400158300001800342500001500360520244600375592002802821650002302849650001202872650001102884650002102895650001602916650002602932650002002958650002102978650002102999650001403020650003303034650002303067650001503090650000903105650001903114650002003133650001403153650004303167653002503210653001403235653003603249653000903285653003603294700001503330700001403345700001603359700001503375700001503390700001503405773015503420856007903575852000903654655001203663IND60570535020221122222711.0190318e201709  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057053502DNAL7 a10.3168/jds.2015-107292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGao, H.N.10aCombination of histidine, lysine, methionine, and leucine promotes β-casein synthesis via the mechanistic target of rapamycin signaling pathway in bovine mammary epithelial cells  ap. 7696-7709.  a2019-12-06  aThe ratio of different AA in the diets of cows is vital to improve milk protein yield. β-Casein is one of the important milk proteins with high nutritive value. However, the suitable ratio of essential amino acids (EAA) for the expression of β-casein in the immortalized bovine mammary epithelial cell line is not fully characterized. This study employed response surface methodology to determine the optimal ratio of His, Lys, Met, and Leu on β-casein expression level in vitro and clarified the effect of the 4 EAA on β-casein via the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway. A central composite design containing 5 axial points per EAA and 28 combinations of the 4 EAA was used in our study. The results of response surface methodology and the changes of the mTOR-related signaling proteins were determined by western blot. The results showed that β-casein level was significantly affected by all 4 EAA (R2 = 0.71). The optimum conditions for β-casein expression are found to be 5.47 mM of His, 7.48 mM of Lys, 1.17 mM of Met, and 8.21 mM of Leu (His:Lys:Met:Leu = 5:6:1:7) in the designed scope of concentration. The interaction of Leu and Met significantly affected β-casein expression (P < 0.01). The phosphorylation of mTOR (Ser2481), regulatory associated protein of target of rapamycin (Ser792), ribosomal protein S6 kinase 1 (Thr389), ribosomal protein S6 (Ser235/236), and eukaryotic elongation factor 2 (Thr56) was increased with the supplementation of either single EAA or an optimal combination of EAA. However, the phosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation factor 4E binding protein 1 (Thr37) was decreased with the addition of Lys, Met, or Leu alone. Furthermore, the phosphorylation (P) of eIF2α (Ser51) was decreased when Met was supplemented alone. Under the optimal mixture of 4 EAA, the phosphorylation of mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 signaling proteins was significantly greater than the single EAA supplementations and the expression of β-casein was 98% as high as the positive control (i.e., medium with all AA). A similar trend was found with P-ribosomal protein S6 kinase 1 and P-ribosomal protein S6. In conclusion, the extracellular concentrations of His, Lys, Met, and Leu at a ratio of 5:6:1:7 maximized β-casein expression in the immortalized bovine mammary epithelial cell line may occur via activation of the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 signaling pathway.  aPublisher supplied data 3amilk protein yield 3aleucine 3alysine 3aepithelial cells 3abeta-casein 3aessential amino acids 3anutritive value 3aWestern blotting 3abinding proteins 3arapamycin 3aresponse surface methodology 3aribosomal proteins 3amethionine 3acows 3amammary glands 3aphosphorylation 3ahistidine 3atarget of rapamycin signaling pathways 0aessential amino acid 0aβ-casein 0abovine mammary epithelial cells 0adiet 0amechanistic target of rapamycin1 aZhao, S.G.1 aZheng, N.1 aZhang, Y.D.1 aWang, S.S.1 aZhou, X.Q.1 aWang, J.Q.0 tJournal of dairy science.g2017 Sept., v. 100, no. 9 p.7696-7709dElsevier Inc.aAmerican Dairy Science AssociationwJournal:jnl45500x0022-03027nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3168/jds.2015-107293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01410naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245009100158300001800249520041100267592002800678650001900706650002500725650002000750650002000770700001800790700001600808700001700824700001800841700001700859773012500876856007401001852000901075655001201084IND60752680820221121055020.0211005e20211004xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075268082DNAL7 a10.1039/d1gc02815d2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuo, Zhiqiang10aCO₂-tuned highly selective reduction of formamides to the corresponding methylamines  ap. 7534-7538.  aWe herein describe an efficient, CO₂-tuned and highly selective C–O bond cleavage of N-methylated formanilides.

Bivalve culture, particularly mussel farming, relies on naturally occurring plankton and numerous studies have demonstrated top-down control on phytoplankton, increased nutrients through excretion of metabolic wastes and remineralization of faeces and pseudofaeces, and bottom-up effects on predators and scavengers through mussel fall-off. However, results are inconsistent between studies, and hydrodynamic conditions and nutrient availability are thought to play an important role in the magnitude and the direction of the ecological effects of mussel culture on the surrounding ecosystem. We used qualitative network models (QNMs), to outline a general model that integrates these environmental conditions and (1) evaluated the ability of different model configurations to reproduce known responses to perturbations, (2) analyzed the behaviour of key components to contrasting hydrodynamic and nutrient condition scenarios, and (3) identified the most influential features of the derived scenarios. The model that included uncertain linkages to characterize unknown relationships performed best based on predetermined validation criteria; the addition of semi-quantitative information on the relative strength of certain linkages improved accuracy and sign determinacy of outcomes. The presence of suspended mussel culture negatively affected primary producers, zooplankton and deposit-feeders, and had a positive effect on predators and scavengers, especially in low-energy environments. Hydrodynamic conditions were shown to have a major impact on the response of the community to mussel culture, while nutrient availability had a very minor impact.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaquaculture industry 3aecosystems 3aenvironmental factors 3aenvironmental impact 3aexcretion 3afeces 3ahydrodynamics 3amodels 3amollusc culture 3amussels 3anutrient availability 3anutrients 3aphytoplankton 3apredators 3azooplankton 0aQNMs 0aQualitative model 0aFood web 0aTrophic network 0aMussel aquaculture 0aShellfish aquaculture1 aDuplisea, Daniel E.1 aSardenne, Fany1 aMcKindsey, Christopher W.0 tEcological modelling.g2020 Aug. 15, v. 430 p.109070-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl6191x0304-38007nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2020.1090703Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04383naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002300094024001700117024002800134040001800162100002300180245014500203300001600348506017300364520248900537650001403026650001703040650001203057650002103069650002803090650001803118650001803136650002303154650001203177650001003189650001903199650001703218650001203235650002903247650002303276650002603299650002403325650001903349650001603368700002303384700002403407773010303431856011403534856007403648956011303722961000903835852000903844655001203853IND60647332220221214225605.0190320e20181123xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064733222DNAL7 a10113/64733222hdl7 a3540112aris7 a10.1093/tas/txy1182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRoberts, Andrew J.10aDevelopmental and reproductive characteristics of beef heifers classified by number of estrous cycles experienced by start of first breeding  ap. 541-548.  aWorks produced by employees of the U.S. Government as part of their official duties are not copyrighted within the U.S. The content of this document is not copyrighted.  aA retrospective analysis was conducted to evaluate the effect of number of estrous cycles exhibited before breeding on growth and reproductive performance of replacement beef heifers fed ad-libitum or restricted by 20% less than ad-libitum during postweaning development over a 9-yr period. Progesterone concentration in blood samples collected at 9- to 11-d intervals were used to assign heifers into groups by number of estrous cycles exhibited before the start of breeding: 0 (nonpubertal; n = 395), 1 (n = 205), 2 (n = 211), 3 (n = 116), or >3 (n = 249). Heifers (P <0.01) in the 0 cycle group were born 6 d later than the 1, 2, or 3 cycle groups, which were born 4 d later (P <0.01) than the >3 cycle group. Weight of heifers at birth decreased (P <0.05) as the number of cycles increased. Weaning weight and ultrasound measures of loin area and fat thickness over the loin at 1 yr age increased as the number of cycles increased (P <0.01). Postwean weight gain, hip height at 1 yr age, and weights from the start of breeding through precalving increased with cycle numbers in a quadratic fashion (P <0.02) and were greater (P <0.05) in ad-libitum than restricted-fed heifers. Pregnancy rate in the 0 cycle group was lower (84%; P <0.05) than the 1 (90%) or >3 (94%) estrous cycles groups and tended to differ (P <0.1) from the 2 (88%) and 3 (89%) estrous cycle groups. Interval from the start of breeding to calving was 3 to 5 d longer (P <0.05) for the 0 cycle group (300 ± 1 d) than other groups. Proportion of heifers calving in the first 21 d was less (P <0.05) in the 0 or 1 cycle groups than other groups. Pregnancy rates of 2-yr-old cows (n = 898) were lowest (P <0.05) for the 0 (73%) and 2 (79%) estrous cycle groups than the 1 (85%), 3 (90%), or >3 (92%) estrous cycle groups. Restricted level of feeding during postweaning development resulted in greater (P <0.05) proportion of heifers in 0 cycle group and lower (P <0.05) proportion in >3 cycle group, but reproductive performance was not influenced (P > 0.1) by level of feeding or interaction of feeding and estrous cycle grouping. In summary, date of birth and rate of physical maturation (weight, height, and fat deposition) were associated with timing of puberty. Pregnancy rate was greater in heifers that exhibited estrus before the start of breeding, but did not improve from having more than one estrous cycle. Proportion conceiving early was greater for heifers having two or more cycles before breeding. 3abeef cows 3abirth weight 3acalving 3acalving interval 3acarcass characteristics 3aestrous cycle 3afat thickness 3agrowth performance 3aheifers 3aloins 3apregnancy rate 3aprogesterone 3apuberty 3areproductive performance 3arestricted feeding 3aretrospective studies 3asexual reproduction 3aweaning weight 3aweight gain1 aKetchum, Jaclyn N.1 aFunston, Richard M.0 tTranslational animal science.g2018 Nov. 23, v. 3, no. 1 p.541-548wJournal:27159x2573-21027nnas40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/64733223Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/tas/txy1183Available from publisher's site  aARIS submissionbhttps://submit.nal.usda.gov/system/files/submissions/2018%20Trans%20Anim%20Sci%20txy118.pdf  aUSDA  aDNAL 7aarticle02523naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100006100144245011500205300002000320520116000340592002801500650001401528650000901542650002401551650001601575650001301591650001301604650001901617650001801636650001601654653002001670653001501690653002501705653000901730653002201739700006301761700005901824773014201883856007902025852000902104655001202113IND60774631920221119135412.0220421e20220407xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077463192DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.2c015942doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYoshimune, Wataru1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8768-012210aIn Situ Small-Angle Neutron Scattering Analysis of Water Evaporation from Porous Exhaust-Gas-Catalyst Supports  ap. 17396-17404.  aPorous media as catalyst supports are key to developing automotive exhaust purification systems. In particular, the water content of these porous media is attracting research attention because catalyst supports containing condensed water vapor at the early stage of cold start require a longer warm-up period. In this regard, water isotherms and evaporation in porous Al₂O₃ were investigated in this study using in situ small-angle neutron scattering (SANS) experiments. Unlike conventional evaluation methods, such as weighing and X-ray tomography, SANS distinguishes water in the primary and secondary pores using a contrast-matching method. Time-resolved measurements showed that water started to evaporate from the secondary pores in tens of seconds and subsequently from the primary pores in a hundred seconds. Exhaustive experiments conducted using nine alumina-based samples revealed that the drying rate depended on the secondary pore size of the porous Al₂O₃. The proposed approach can enable the evaluation of controlling factors to additionally optimize the performance of automotive exhaust gas catalysts, especially during cold start.  aPublisher supplied data 3acatalysts 3acold 3acomputed tomography 3aevaporation 3aneutrons 3aporosity 3awater analysis 3awater content 3awater vapor 0aalumina support 0acold start 0aexhaust gas catalyst 0aSANS 0awater evaporation1 aKato, S.q(Satoru),1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5590-86521 aHarada, Masashi1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0263-67020 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2022 Apr. 07, v. 14, no. 15 p.17396-17404dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.2c015943Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03128naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002200153245014900175300001400324520171800338592002802056650001302084650002202097650001702119650001602136650001602152650002202168650001102190650001902201650001302220650003502233650001902268651001502287653002402302653001602326653001702342653001202359653001702371653001302388653001602401700001902417700002902436773009602465856008802561852000902649655001202658IND60556577620221117183444.0190318e201701  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055657762DNAL7 a10.1016/j.phytochem.2016.10.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLindqvist, Dennis10aBiosynthesis of hydroxylated polybrominated diphenyl ethers and the correlation with photosynthetic pigments in the red alga Ceramium tenuicorne  ap. 51-58.  aHydroxylated polybrominated diphenyl ethers (OH-PBDEs) have been identified in a variety of marine organisms from different trophic levels indicating a large spread in the environment. There is much evidence pointing towards natural production as the major source of these compounds in nature. However, much is still not known about the natural production of these compounds. Seasonal trend studies have shown large fluctuations in the levels of OH-PBDEs in Ceramium tenuicorne from the Baltic Sea. Yet, even though indications of stimuli that can induce the production of these compounds have been observed, none, neither internal nor external, has been assigned to be responsible for the recorded fluctuations. In the present study the possible relationship between the concentration of pigments and that of OH-PBDEs in C. tenuicorne has been addressed. Significant correlations were revealed between the concentrations of all OH-PBDEs quantified and the concentrations of both chlorophyll a and Σxanthophylls + carotenoids. All of which displayed a concentration peak in mid-July. The levels of OH-PBDEs may be linked to photosynthetic activity, and hence indirectly to photosynthetic pigments, via bromoperoxidase working as a scavenger for hydrogen peroxide formed during photosynthesis. Yet the large apparent investment in producing specific OH-PBDE congeners point towards an targeted production, with a more specific function than being a waste product of photosynthesis. The OH-PBDE congener pattern observed in this study is not agreeable with some currently accepted models for the biosynthesis of these compounds, and indicates a more selective route than previously considered in C. tenuicorne.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCeramium 3aaquatic organisms 3abiosynthesis 3acarotenoids 3achlorophyll 3ahydrogen peroxide 3amodels 3aphotosynthesis 3apigments 3apolybrominated diphenyl ethers 3atrophic levels 3aBaltic Sea 0aCeramium tenuicorne 0aCeramiaceae 0aBiosynthesis 0aOH-PBDE 0aBromophenols 0aPigments 0aChlorophyll1 aDahlgren, Elin1 aAsplund, L.q(Lillemor),0 tPhytochemistry.g2017 Jan., v. 133 p.51-58dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl44710x0031-94227nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.phytochem.2016.10.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03257naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100006500145245011300210300001800323500001900341520177500360592002802135650001302163650001502176650002202191650002602213650001502239650002002254650000702274650001502281650001402296650001502310650001502325650001202340650001602352700002202368700002102390700005502411700005702466700006102523773013902584856007902723852000902802655001202811IND60695895320221122134147.0200519e20200504xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069589532DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.est.9b064482doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aReinoso-Maset, Estela1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8526-135110aDissolved Carbonate and pH Control the Dissolution of Uranyl Phosphate Minerals in Flow-Through Porous Media  ap. 6031-6042.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aUranyl phosphate minerals represent an important secondary source of uranium release at contaminated sites. In flow-through column experiments with background porewater (BPW) of typical freshwater aquifer composition (pH 7.0, ∼0.2 mM total carbonate (TC)), dissolution of K-ankoleite (KUO₂PO₄·3H₂O), Na-autunite (NaUO₂PO₄·3H₂O), and Ca-autunite (Ca(UO₂)₂(PO₄)₂·6H₂O) was controlled by mineral solubility at steady-state U release. Effluent concentrations indicated exchange with BPW cations, and postreaction characterization showed alteration of the initial mineral composition, changes in structure (decreased crystallinity, increased disorder, and distortion of U–P mineral sheets) and possible neoformation of phases of similar structure. Increasing the BPW pH and TC to 8.1–8.2 and 2.2–3.7 mM, respectively, resulted in mineral undersaturation and produced ca. 2 orders-of-magnitude higher U and P release without reaching steady state. Minerals incorporated less BPW cations into their structures compared to low carbonate BPW experiments but showed structural disorder and distortion. Faster dissolution rates were attributed to the formation of binary and ternary uranyl carbonate complexes that accelerate the rate-determining step of uranyl detachment from the uranyl-phosphate layered structure. Calculated dissolution rates (log Rₛ between −8.95 and −10.32 mol m–² s–¹), accounting for reaction and transport in porous media, were similar to dissolution rates of other classes of uranyl minerals. In undersaturated solutions, dissolution rates for uranyl phosphate, oxyhydroxide, and silicate minerals can be predicted within 1–2 orders-of-magnitude from pH ∼5–10 on the basis of pH/carbonate concentration.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaquifers 3acarbonates 3acrystal structure 3aenvironmental science 3afreshwater 3amineral content 3apH 3aphosphates 3asilicates 3asolubility 3atechnology 3auranium 3auranyl ions1 aPerdrial, Nicolas1 aSteefel, Carl I.1 aUm, Wooyong1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3826-00301 aChorover, Jon1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9497-01951 aO’Day, Peggy A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8698-51590 tEnvironmental science & technology.g2020 May 04, v. 54, no. 10 p.6031-6042dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23339x1520-58517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.9b064483Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01600naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001400145245019100159300001800350520052100368592002800889650001400917650003100931650002200962700001600984700001901000700001801019700002001037700002001057773011901077856008101196852000901277655001201286IND60550449420221118034416.0160911e20150821xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055044942DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.joc.5b014912doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYou, Yong10aEnantioselective Synthesis of 3,3-Disubstituted Oxindoles Bearing Two Different Heteroatoms at the C3 Position by Organocatalyzed Sulfenylation and Selenenylation of 3-Pyrrolyl-oxindoles  ap. 8470-8477.  aCatalytic asymmetric sulfenylation and selenenylation of 3-pyrrolyl-oxindoles for the synthesis of 3,3-disubstituted oxindoles bearing two different heteroatoms at the C3 position have been achieved with commercially available cinchonidine as catalyst.

Hyaluronic acid is a naturally occurring biopolymer, which has important biological functions in bacteria and higher animals including humans. It is found in most connective tissues and is particularly concentrated in synovial fluid, the vitreous fluid of the eye, umbilical cords and chicken combs. It is naturally synthesized by a class of integral membrane proteins called hyaluronan synthases, and degraded by a family of enzymes called hyaluronidases.

Rhododendron brachycarpum has been traditionally used for the control of diabetes, hepatitis, hypertension, and rheumatoid arthritis and classified as an endangered species in Korea. A grayanotox-9(11)-ene derivative along with five known diterpenoids, were isolated from the MeOH extract of R. brachycarpum. Extensive 1D and 2D NMR experiments were conducted to establish the 2D structure and relative configuration of the grayanotox-9(11)-ene derivative. Comparison of simulated and experimental ECD spectra resulted in an inconclusive outcome to assign its absolute configuration. Alternatively, gauge-including atomic orbitals (GIAO) NMR chemical shift calculations, with support by the advanced statistical method DP4 plus, and acid hydrolysis were employed to establish its absolute configuration. This work exemplifies how NMR analysis, combined with quantum mechanics calculations, is a viable approach to accomplish structural assignment of minor abundance molecules in lieu of X-ray crystallography or chiroptical approaches.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRhododendron 3aX-ray diffraction 3aacid hydrolysis 3adiabetes 3aditerpenoids 3aendangered species 3ahepatitis 3ahypertension 3amethanol 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aquantum mechanics 3arheumatoid arthritis 3aKorean Peninsula 0aRhododendron brachycarpum 0aDP4 plus 0aGauge-including atomic orbitals NMR chemical shift calculations 0aStereochemical assignments 0aEndangered plant species 0aElectronic circular dichroism1 aOh, Joonseok1 aPark, Hyun Bong1 aFerreira, Daneel1 aChoe, Sanggil1 aLee, Juseon1 aNa, MinKyun0 tPhytochemistry.g2017 Jan., v. 133 p.45-50dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl44710x0031-94227nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.phytochem.2016.10.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03101naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002300094024001700117024003600134040001800170100002100188245005000209300001600259506017300275520103800448650001801486650002501504650001401529650002101543650002801564650002301592650002501615650001901640650002501659650001701684650002601701650001401727650002701741650003201768650001801800650002801818650001501846650001201861650001201873650002401885650001801909650001601927650001901943700002201962700002501984700001502009700001702024700003102041773010502072856011402177856004902291956012902340961000902469852000902478655001202487IND60647332520221214225612.0190320e20180301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064733252DNAL7 a10113/64733252hdl7 a3470992aris7 a10.1177/1934578X18013003022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLabruzzo, Andrea10aPhytotoxic Lignans from Artemisia arborescens  ap. 237-240.  aWorks produced by employees of the U.S. Government as part of their official duties are not copyrighted within the U.S. The content of this document is not copyrighted.  aA systematic bioassay-guided fractionation of methylene chloride extracts of the aerial part of Artemisia arborescens was performed in order to identify its phytotoxic compounds. Two lignans were isolated, sesamin and ashantin, that inhibited growth of Agrostis stolonifera (bentgrass), a monocot, and Lactuca sativa (lettuce), a dicot, at 1 mg mL(-1). In a dose-response screening of these lignans for growth inhibition against Lemna paucicostata (duckweed), ashantin was the most active with an IC(50) of ca. 224 µM. The mode of action of these compounds is still unknown. In mosquito larvicidal bioassays against Aedes aegypti, isolated pure compounds sesamin and ashantin did not show any activity at the highest dose of 125 mg/L against 1-d-old Aedes aegypti larvae. In bioautography bioassays for antifungal activity using Botritis cinerea, Fusarium oxysporum, Colletotrichum fragariae, Colletotrichum acutatum, and Colletotrichum gloeosporioides, ashantin and sesamin were inactive at the highest amount tested, 5 micrograms. 3aAedes aegypti 3aAgrostis stolonifera 3aArtemisia 3aBotrytis cinerea 3aColletotrichum acutatum 3aFusarium oxysporum 3aGlomerella cingulata 3aLactuca sativa 3aLemna aequinoctialis 3aaerial parts 3aantifungal properties 3abioassays 3abotanical insecticides 3ainhibitory concentration 50 3ainsect larvae 3ainsecticidal properties 3alarvicides 3alettuce 3alignans 3amechanism of action 3aphytotoxicity 3aphytotoxins 3aplant extracts1 aCantrell, Charles1 aCarrubba, Alessandra1 aAli, Abbas1 aWedge, David1 aDuke, Stevec(Saxophonist)0 tNatural product communications.g2018 Mar. 1, v. 13, no. 3 p.237-240wJournal:28151x1934-578X7nnas40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/64733253Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1934578X1801300302  aARIS submissionbhttps://submit.nal.usda.gov/system/files/submissions/Phytotoxic%20Lignans%20-%20Cantrell%20-%20347099_0.pdf  aUSDA  aDNAL 7aarticle02837naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100005100144245008600195300002000281520117200301592002801473650001501501650001501516650001901531650002001550650001101570650001101581653001401592653003001606653003801636653002501674653002301699700001701722700001601739700005301755700001701808700005201825700005601877700001701933700005401950700001602004700005102020700005402071773014202125856007902267852000902346655001202355IND60771083620221119161829.0220323e20220311xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077108362DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.1c241462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Qi1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5914-390910aPerpendicular Manganite Magnetic Tunnel Junctions Induced by Interfacial Coupling  ap. 13883-13890.  aThe half-metallic manganite oxide La₂/₃Sr₁/₃MnO₃ (LSMO) has a very high spin polarization of ∼100%, making it ideal for ferromagnetic electrodes to realize tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR). Because of the in-plane magnetic anisotropy of the ferromagnetic LSMO electrode, which leads to the density limit of memory, realizing perpendicular tunneling in manganite-based magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJ) is critical for future applications. Here, we design and fabricate manganite-based MTJs composed of alternately stacked cobaltite and manganite layers that demonstrate strong perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA) induced by interfacial coupling. Moreover, spin-dependent tunneling behaviors with an out-of-plane magnetic field were observed in the perpendicular MTJs. We found that the direct tunneling effect plays a dominant role in the low bias region during the transport behavior of devices, which is associated with thermionic emission of electrons or oxygen vacancies in the high bias region. Our works of realizing perpendicular tunneling in manganite-based MTJs lead to new approaches for designing and developing all-oxide spintronic devices.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanisotropy 3aelectrodes 3aferromagnetism 3amagnetic fields 3amemory 3aoxygen 0amanganite 0amagnetic tunnel junctions 0aperpendicular magnetic anisotropy 0ainterfacial coupling 0aspintronic devices1 aLiu, Pengfei1 aLi, Xiaowen1 aHu, Sixia1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7568-67861 aZhu, Yuanmin1 aJin, Cai1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4260-55451 aHan, Wenqiao1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1394-31151 aJi, Yanjiang1 aXu, Zedong1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4417-13681 aHu, Songbai1 aYe, Mao1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2157-62581 aChen, Lang1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2460-82320 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2022 Mar. 11, v. 14, no. 11 p.13883-13890dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.1c241463Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03840naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001800152245008000170520246400250592002802714650002002742650001602762650001502778650002102793650002202814650001802836650001402854650001302868650001102881650002402892650001102916650001102927653002402938653002702962653004202989653001803031653001703049653001503066653001803081700001803099700001703117700001803134700001403152773009603166856008703262852000903349655001203358IND60746506920221121122144.0220809e20211201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074650692DNAL7 a10.1016/j.geoderma.2021.1153632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShi, Xiaoqing12aA meta-analysis on effects of root development on soil hydraulic properties  aRoot development can alter the structure of soil and its hydraulic properties, which in turn can affect runoff generation processes. Although some experimental studies have examined the relationships between root characteristics and soil hydraulic properties under certain conditions, the general patterns of the effects of root development on soil hydraulic properties under different conditions remain unclear. With an aim of examining the change patterns and factors influencing soil hydraulic properties induced by root development, we conducted a literature review and subsequent meta-analysis based on the evaluated literature data. Our findings revealed that root development significantly increased soil infiltration rates [average infiltration rate (AIR), 80.1%; initial infiltration rate (IIR), 81.8%; and steady infiltration rate (SIR), 144.9%], and saturated hydraulic conductivity (Kₛₐₜ) by 46.3%. Among the selected indexes, only the non-capillary porosity showed moderate correlation with AIR and IIR (R² = 0.6–0.65), and root length density showed a low correlation with soil infiltration rates (R² = 0.2–0.3). In forestland, the increase in SIR was 5.6 times that of grassland; furthermore, SIR in soil associated with plants more than 5 years old was 3-fold higher than that observed in 1–5-year-old plants. Based on our analyses, we established that the identification of a general pattern in the relationship between root characteristics and soil hydraulic properties could not be achieved owing to the diverse influences of different conditions. For example, increases in soil infiltration rates and Kₛₐₜ were found to be higher in loam soils and in soils with plants bearing a larger number of tap roots. Nevertheless, it can be implied that infiltration rates and Kₛₐₜ gradually increase with plant age, and that root systems generally exert the most pronounced effect on infiltration rates in spring and summer. Accordingly, we recommend that future experimental research should focus on the effects of root systems under specific conditions, and that datasets based on observations recorded under multiple conditions should be compiled to establish general patterns based on the corresponding relationships under specific conditions. The information thus obtained would accordingly provide a basis for conducting further in-depth studies examining soil water movement and terrestrial hydrological cycle.  aPublisher supplied data 3adata collection 3aforest land 3agrasslands 3ahydrologic cycle 3ainfiltration rate 3ameta-analysis 3aplant age 3aporosity 3arunoff 3asoil water movement 3aspring 3asummer 0aRoot characteristic 0aSoil infiltration rate 0aSoil saturated hydraulic conductivity 0aSoil porosity 0aSoil texture 0aPlant type 0aMeta-analysis1 aQin, Tianling1 aYan, Denghua1 aTian, Fuqiang1 aWang, Hao0 tGeoderma.g2021 Dec. 01, v. 403 p.115363-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl16374x0016-70617nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.geoderma.2021.1153633Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03003naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001700144245010400161300001400265520165600279592002801935650001301963650001301976650002101989650001302010650000902023650001902032650001402051650002302065650002702088650002002115650001002135650001302145650001802158650001402176700003502190700002502225700001602250700001702266700001902283700002202302773013302324856007902457852000902536655001202545IND60773671620221116193602.0220419e20220328xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077367162DNAL7 a10.17221/196/2021-cjas2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPytlík, Jan10aEffect of extender on the quality and incubation resilience of cryopreserved Holstein bull semen  ap. 75-86.  aThere are still concerns over sperm quality when plant-based diluents are used instead of animal-based semen extenders. Therefore, in our study we compared the effects of one soybean lecithin-based (AndroMed<sup>®</sup>) and two egg yolk-based (BullXcell<sup>®</sup> and Optidyl<sup>®</sup>) commercially available extenders on post-thaw in vitro sperm quality. Fifty ejaculates collected from ten bulls were aliquoted into three parts and diluted with the above-mentioned extenders. Post-thaw sperm viability, mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), plasma membrane integrity, and acrosome status were analysed immediately after thawing (0 h) and at an hourly interval during 2-h incubation at 38 °C. Sperm functionality variables were assessed by simultaneous quadruple staining using flow cytometry. Semen stored in Optidyl<sup>® </sup>had a greater viability, plasma membrane and acrosome integrity than that stored in AndroMed<sup>®</sup> and BullXcell<sup>®</sup> (P < 0.05). With the use of BullXcell<sup>®</sup> there was a higher percentage of sperm with high MMP (P < 0.05) when compared with the other extenders. The incubation affected the development of sperm quality parameters differently as the variables related to the plasma membrane showed an increase, while MMP and acrosome integrity showed a decline. Although the semen from all bulls responded to treatments in a similar manner, significant intra- and inter-male differences were found. In conclusion, the results clearly displayed the beneficial effects of egg yolk over soybean lecithin supplementation on in vitro sperm quality.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHolstein 3aacrosome 3acryopreservation 3aegg yolk 3aeggs 3aflow cytometry 3alecithins 3amembrane potential 3amitochondrial membrane 3aplasma membrane 3asemen 3asoybeans 3asperm quality 3aviability1 aSavvulidi, Filipp Georgijevič1 aDucháček, Jaromír1 aCodl, Radim1 aVrhel, Marek1 aNagy, Szabolcs1 aStádník, Luděk0 tCzech Journal of Animal Science.g, v. 67, no. 3 p.75-86dCzech Academy of Agricultural ScienceswJournal:14567x1212-18197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.17221/196/2021-cjas3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01384naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002500151245012100176300001600297520040500313592002800718650001100746650002100757653000800778653000800786653002200794653001300816653002400829653001800853773010500871856008500976852000901061655001201070IND60599822820221118010601.0180702e201407  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059982282DNAL7 a10.1016/j.econlet.2014.05.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKobayashi, Teruyoshi12aA model of financial contagion with variable asset returns may be replaced with a simple threshold model of cascades  ap. 113-116.  aI show the equivalence between a model of financial contagion and the threshold model of global cascades proposed by Watts (2002).

Herein, a polyimide/polyvinylpyrrolidone (PI/PVP, denoted as PP) coating layer is demonstrated as dual protection for the LiNi₀.₉₆Mg₀.₀₂Ti₀.₀₂O₂ (NMT) cathode material to suppress surface contamination against moist air and to prevent unwanted interfacial side reactions during cycling. The PP-coated NMT (PP@NMT) preserves a relatively clean surface with the bare generation of lithium residues, structural degradation, and gas evolution even after exposure to air with ∼30% humidity for 2 weeks compared to the bare NMT. In addition, the exposed PP@NMT significantly enhances the electrochemical performance of graphite||NMT cells by preventing byproducts and structural distortion. Moreover, the exposed PP@NMT achieves a high capacity retention of 86.7% after 500 cycles using an advanced localized high-concentration electrolyte. This work demonstrates promising protection of Co-free/Ni-rich layered cathodes for their practical usage even after exposure to moist air.  aPublisher supplied data  aDE-AC05-76RL01830cOffice of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energydhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100006134  aDE-EE0008444cOffice of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energydhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100006134 3aair 3acathodes 3acobalt 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrolytes 3ahumidity 3alithium 3apolyvinylpyrrolidone 0aCo-free/Ni-rich layered cathode 0aprotection layer 0aelectrode/electrolyte interphase 0alithium-ion battery 0alocalized high-concentration electrolyte1 aXu, Yaobin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9945-35141 aEngelhard, Mark H.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5543-08121 aHu, Jiangtao1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2725-75811 aLim, Hyung Seok,1 aJia, Hao1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2814-55891 aYang, Zhijie1 aMatthews, Bethany E.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7193-25831 aTripathi, Shalini1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3612-93461 aZhang, Xianhui1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5992-92691 aZhong, Lirong1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5052-939X1 aLin, Feng1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3729-31481 aWang, C.q(Chongmin),1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3327-09581 aXu, Wu1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2685-86840 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2022 Apr. 07, v. 14, no. 15 p.17405-17414dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.2c016943Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02194naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002300094024001700117024003000134024002200164024001900186040001800205100001500223245010400238506007600342506017300418520024500591506003700836650003700873650002100910650001200931650002900943650002100972650001100993650001301004650002201017650002101039650002501060650002201085650001701107651001501124700001801139700001801157700001601175700001901191700001701210700002201227773010101249856011401350856007601464956009401540961000901634852000901643655001201652IND60647332720221214225547.0190320e20181115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064733272DNAL7 a10113/64733272hdl7 a3586622aris7 a10.1128/MRA.01364-182doi7 aPMC62564722pmcid7 a305337852pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTran, Thao10aComplete Genome Sequence of subsp Strain 14B4, Which Inhibits the Growth of Serotype Poona In Vitro  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aWorks produced by employees of the U.S. Government as part of their official duties are not copyrighted within the U.S. The content of this document is not copyrighted.  aWe present here the complete genome sequence of Lactococcus lactis strain 14B4, isolated from almond drupes in northern California.

Stool consistency and frequency were determined over the course of therapy. Clinical and microbiological outcomes were assessed during therapy, at the end of therapy (EOT) and during a 19–38-day follow-up visit. Faecal vancomycin concentrations in 55 stool samples from 15 patients ranged from 175–6299μg/g at Days 3–5 of therapy (midpoint), 17–5277μg/g at EOT and 0–70μg/g at follow-up. Clinical cure or failure at EOT and at follow-up was not dependent on vancomycin concentrations measured at the midpoint (P=0.72) or at EOT (P=0.76). Likewise, concentrations at EOT and at follow-up did not predict colonisation at follow-up (P=0.85 and 0.71, respectively). Faecal vancomycin concentrations during the course of therapy (Days 3–5) did not differ with either stool consistency or frequency (P=0.94 and 0.16, respectively).

Oral vancomycin 125mg q6h led to faecal concentrations that did not predict clinical outcomes of CDI in terms of cure or gut colonisation and did not vary with stool consistency and frequency.  aPublisher supplied data 3aClostridium difficile 3adigestive system 3afeces 3apatients 3atherapeutics 3avancomycin 0aVancomycin 0aFaecal concentration 0aPharmacokinetics 0aClostridium difficile 0aColonisation1 aNicolau, David P.0 tInternational journal of antimicrobial agents.g2015 Aug., v. 46, no. 2 p.205-208dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12451x0924-85797nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijantimicag.2015.03.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04007naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001700152245016300169520218900332592002802521650002502549650002102574650002702595650002402622650002902646650001102675650001502686650002402701650001302725650001902738650001602757650001102773650001302784650001602797650001702813650001902830650001502849650001202864650001202876650001202888650002302900650002502923650001402948653002502962653002702987653002203014653003603036653003103072653001403103653001003117700001703127700001603144700002203160700001903182773009603201856008703297852000903384655001203393IND60701922820221120125022.0210820e202101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070192282DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodcont.2020.1074722doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhu, Mei-Jun10aValidation of Enterococcus faecium NRRL B-2354 as a surrogate for Listeria monocytogenes on fresh apples during pilot spray-bar peroxyacetic acid intervention  aAntimicrobial sanitizers applied through a manifold spray-bar brush bed system is a main intervention strategy to prevent cross-contamination of foodborne pathogens on fresh apples. To date, information about antimicrobial efficacy of sanitizers including peroxyacetic acid (PAA) intervention is mainly based on laboratory submerging testing which cannot be directly applied into spray-bar system in apple processing facility due to differences in processing parameters. Previously, we examined anti-Listeria efficacies of PAA in laboratory testing. The studies herein further verified the effectiveness of the selected PAA treatments in a pilot apple spray processing line against Listeria monocytogenes surrogate strains, Enterococcus faecium NRRL B-2354 and Listeria innocua, on apples of the selected varieties. The quality attributes of apples after the selected treatments were further evaluated. A 2-min, 80 ppm PAA treatment at 43 °C and 46 °C resulted in 2.4 and 2.4–2.7 Log₁₀ CFU/apple reduction of E. faecium on different apple varieties, respectively, which had similar reductions compared to L. monocytogenes (2.3–2.5 and 2.5–2.8 Log₁₀ CFU/apple reduction), indicating that E. faecium NRRL B-2354 is a suitable surrogate of L. monocytogenes for evaluating PAA efficacy at test temperatures (22–46 °C). Using this pilot spray-bar system, we further showed that a 30-sec spray wash of 80 ppm PAA at 22 °C and 44–46 °C resulted in 0.8–1.1 and 1.5–1.6 Log₁₀ CFU/apple reduction of E. faecium on apple of the selected varieties, respectively, which were comparable to those of L. innocua. In addition, PAA applied at 44–46 °C did not affect the firmness, total soluble solids content and titratable acidity of apple fruits of tested varieties compared to its application at ambient temperature over 3-week of commercial storage. This study showed that E. faecium NRRL B-2354 is a suitable surrogate strain of L. monocytogenes during the pilot fresh apple processing and provides valuable practical data of PAA spray-bar intervention to the apple industry, facilitating compliance with the Preventive Controls for Human Food Rule.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEnterococcus faecium 3aListeria innocua 3aListeria monocytogenes 3aambient temperature 3aantimicrobial properties 3aapples 3acompliance 3across contamination 3afirmness 3afood pathogens 3afood safety 3ahumans 3aindustry 3ainformation 3alaboratories 3aperacetic acid 3asanitizers 3astorage 3astrains 3atesting 3atitratable acidity 3atotal soluble solids 3avarieties 0aEnterococcus faecium 0aListeria monocytogenes 0aPeroxyacetic acid 0aPilot apple processing facility 0aSpray-bar brush bed system 0aSurrogate 0aApple1 aShen, Xiaoye1 aSheng, Lina1 aMendoza, Manoella1 aHanrahan, Ines0 tFood control.g2021 Jan., v. 119 p.107472-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl56242x0956-71357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodcont.2020.1074723Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03305naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094024002200127024001900149040001800168100002700186245014400213300001600357506007600373520168300449592002802132506003702160650001202197650002302209650001502232650004902247650002202296650002702318650001302345650000902358650001302367650001402380650002002394700001802414700001802432700002102450700003802471700001802509700001702527700002102544773017002565856007902735852000902814655001202823IND60173743820221207094215.0150603e20130108xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6017374382DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.12025751102doi7 aPMC35458172pmcid7 a232671082pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPandelia, Maria-Eirini10aElectronic structure of the unique [4Fe-3S] cluster in O₂-tolerant hydrogenases characterized by ⁵⁷Fe Mössbauer and EPR spectroscopy  ap. 483-488.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aIron–sulfur clusters are ubiquitous electron transfer cofactors in hydrogenases. Their types and redox properties are important for H ₂ catalysis, but, recently, their role in a protection mechanism against oxidative inactivation has also been recognized for a [4Fe-3S] cluster in O ₂-tolerant group 1 [NiFe] hydrogenases. This cluster, which is uniquely coordinated by six cysteines, is situated in the proximity of the catalytic [NiFe] site and exhibits unusual redox versatility. The [4Fe-3S] cluster in hydrogenase (Hase) I from Aquifex aeolicus performs two redox transitions within a very small potential range, forming a superoxidized state above +200 mV vs. standard hydrogen electrode (SHE). Crystallographic data has revealed that this state is stabilized by the coordination of one of the iron atoms to a backbone nitrogen. Thus, the proximal [4Fe-3S] cluster undergoes redox-dependent changes to serve multiple purposes beyond classical electron transfer. In this paper, we present field-dependent ⁵⁷Fe-Mössbauer and EPR data for Hase I, which, in conjunction with spectroscopically calibrated density functional theory (DFT) calculations, reveal the distribution of Fe valences and spin-coupling schemes for the iron–sulfur clusters. The data demonstrate that the electronic structure of the [4Fe-3S] core in its three oxidation states closely resembles that of corresponding conventional [4Fe-4S] cubanes, albeit with distinct differences for some individual iron sites. The medial and distal iron–sulfur clusters have similar electronic properties as the corresponding cofactors in standard hydrogenases, although their redox potentials are higher.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAquifex 3acatalytic activity 3aelectrodes 3aelectron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aelectron transfer 3aferredoxin hydrogenase 3ahydrogen 3airon 3anitrogen 3aoxidation 3aredox potential1 aBykov, Dmytro1 aIzsak, Robert1 aInfossi, Pascale1 aGiudici-Orticoni, Marie-Thérèse1 aBill, Eckhard1 aNeese, Frank1 aLubitz, Wolfgang0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2013 Jan. 8, v. 110, no. 2 p.483-488dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.12025751103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02807naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001700144245011300161300002000274520122200294592002801516650002801544650001301572650001301585650001201598650001601610650001501626650001701641650001701658650002101675653001901696653002001715653001801735653003201753700001801785700005501803700001901858700001801877700001601895700001801911700002001929700001701949700006001966700005702026773014202083856007902225852000902304655001202313IND60771083920221119161835.0220323e20220307xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077108392DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.1c244522doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, Jin Goo10aMolecular-Level Lubrication Effect of 0D Nanodiamonds for Highly Bendable Graphene Liquid Crystalline Fibers  ap. 13601-13610.  aGraphene fiber is emerging as a new class of carbon-based fiber with distinctive material properties particularly useful for electroconductive components for wearable devices. Presently, stretchable and bendable graphene fibers are principally employing soft dielectric additives, such as polymers, which can significantly deteriorate the genuine electrical properties of pristine graphene-based structures. We report molecular-level lubricating nanodiamonds as an effective physical property modifier to improve the mechanical flexibility of graphene fibers by relieving the tight interlayer stacking among graphene sheets. Nanoscale-sized NDs effectively increase the tensile strain and bending strain of graphene/nanodiamond composite fibers while maintaining the genuine electrical conductivity of pristine graphene-based fibers. The molecular-level lubricating mechanism is elucidated by friction force microscopy on the nanoscale as well as by shear stress measurement on the macroscopic scale. The resultant highly bendable graphene/nanodiamond composite fiber is successfully weaved into all graphene fiber-based textiles and wearable Joule heaters, proposing the potential for reliable wearable applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aelectrical conductivity 3afriction 3agraphene 3aliquids 3alubrication 3amicroscopy 3ananodiamonds 3ashear stress 3atensile strength 0agraphene oxide 0aliquid crystals 0ahybrid fibers 0amolecular-level lubrication1 aYun, Taeyeong1 aChae, Junsu1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0694-45901 aYang, Geon Gug1 aLee, Gang San1 aKim, In-ho,1 aJung, Hong Ju1 aHwang, Ho Seong1 aKim, Jun Tae1 aChoi, Siyoung Q.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6020-30911 aKim, Sang Ouk1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1513-60420 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2022 Mar. 07, v. 14, no. 11 p.13601-13610dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.1c244523Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle05450naa a2200793 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001700094024002300111024003900134024002200173024001900195024001200214040001800226100001900244245008700263300001600350506007600366506017300442520176900615536054102384592002802925596009802953596010803051596012503159596009903284506003703383650002503420650001903445650001303464650001703477650002003494650003103514650001003545650002603555650001003581650002003591650001503611650001303626650002603639650002103665650002203686653001403708653001003722653000903732653001603741653000803757700001603765700001803781700001403799700001903813700001603832700001703848700001603865700001603881700001703897700001503914700001603929700001703945773010403962856008604066856011404152956017904266956017704445961001304622852000904635655001204644IND60647333020221214225600.0200428e20190102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064733302DNAL7 a3445792aris7 a10113/64733302hdl7 a10.1080/15476286.2018.15644622doi7 aPMC63803382pmcid7 a306082052pmid8 ans16013  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Xinheng10aCircular RNA Vav3 sponges gga-miR-375 to promote epithelial-mesenchymal transition  ap. 118-132.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aWorks produced by employees of the U.S. Government as part of their official duties are not copyrighted within the U.S. The content of this document is not copyrighted.  aCircular RNAs (circRNAs) are evolutionarily conserved and widely present, but their functions remain largely unknown. Recent development has highlighted the importance of circRNAs as the sponge of microRNA (miRNA) in cancer. We previously reported that gga-miR-375 was downregulated in the liver tumors of chickens infected with avian leukosis virus subgroup J (ALV-J) by microRNA microarray assay. It can be reasonably assumed in accordance with previous studies that the gga-miR-375 may be related to circRNAs. However, the question as to which circRNA acts as the sponge for gga-miR-375 remains to be answered. In this study, circRNA sequencing results revealed that a circRNA Vav3 termed circ-Vav3 was upregulated in the liver tumors of chickens infected with ALV-J. In addition, RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP), biotinylated RNA pull-down and RNA-fluorescence in situ hybridization (RNA-FISH) experiments were conducted to confirm that circ-Vav3 serves as the sponge of gga-miR-375. Furthermore, we confirmed through dual luciferase reporter assay that YAP1 is the target gene of gga-miR-375. The effect of the sponge function of circ-Vav3 on its downstream genes has been further verified by our conclusion that the sponge function of circ-Vav3 can abrogate gga-miR-375 target gene YAP1 and increase the expression level of YAP1. We further confirmed that the circ-Vav3/gga-miR-375/YAP1 axis induces epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) through influencing EMT markers to promote tumorigenesis. Finally, clinical ALV-J-induced tumor livers were collected to detect core gene expression levels to provide a proof to the concluded tumorigenic mechanism. Together, our results suggest that circ-Vav3/gga-miR-375/YAP1 axis is another regulator of tumorigenesis.  aThis study was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant Nos. 31672564, 31472217), International Science and technology cooperation project of Guangdong Province (2016A050502042), Construction project of modern agricultural science and technology innovation alliance in Guangdong Province (2018LM1112), and the Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province (Grant No. S2013030013313);Construction project of modern agricultural science and technology innovation alliance in Guangdong Province [2018LM1112].  aPublisher supplied data  a31672564cNational Natural Science Foundation of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001809  aS2013030013313cNatural Science Foundation of Guangdong Provincedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100003453  a2018LM1112cConstruction project of modern agricultural science and technology innovation alliance in Guangdong Province  a2016A050502042cInternational Science and technology cooperation project of Guangdong Province0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAvian leukosis virus 3acarcinogenesis 3achickens 3acircular RNA 3agene expression 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3ain situ hybridization 3aliver 3aliver neoplasms 3aluciferase 3amicroRNA 3amicroarray technology 3aprecipitin tests 3asequence analysis 0acirc-Vav3 0aALV-J 0aYAP1 0agga-miR-375 0aEMT1 aYan, Yiming1 aLin, Wencheng1 aLi, Aijun1 aZhang, Huanmin1 aLei, Xiaoya1 aDai, Zhenkai1 aLi, Xinjian1 aLi, Hongxin1 aChen, Weiguo1 aChen, Feng1 aMa, Jingyun1 aXie, Qingmei0 tRNA biology.g2019 Jan. 2, v. 16, no. 1 p.118-132dTaylor & FranciswJournal:27170x1555-85847nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15476286.2018.15644623Available from publisher's site40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/64733303Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  aARIS submissionbhttps://submit.nal.usda.gov/system/files/submissions/Circular%20RNA%20Vav3%20sponges%20gga-miR-375%20to%20promote%20epithelial-mesenchymal%20transition_0.pdf  aARIS submissionbhttps://submit.nal.usda.gov/system/files/submissions/Circular%20RNA%20Vav3%20sponges%20gga-miR-375%20to%20promote%20epithelial-mesenchymal%20transition.pdf  aUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle03464naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245014000168500001900308520207300327592002802400650002402428650001502452650002902467650001302496650001902509650001002528650001702538650000902555650000902564650001902573650002202592650002502614650002802639653002002667653001902687653003202706653001402738653001602752700001702768700001902785773010802804856008502912852000902997655001203006IND60696652320221118051045.0200824e202006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069665232DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vetpar.2020.1091342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStarkey, L.A.10aComparison of acid- versus heat-treatment for immune complex dissociation and detection of Dirofilaria immitis antigen in canine plasma  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aAnnual antigen testing is a mainstay for diagnosing infection with Dirofiliaria immitis in dogs; yet, it has been documented that some heartworm-infected dogs and cats test false-negative for antigen due to the presence of antigen-antibody complexes. Several studies have reported the use of heat as a reliable means of immune-complex dissociation (ICD) in recent years; however, the data regarding the use of acid as a reliable method of ICD for D. immitis detection are limited. The objective of this study was to compare an acid-based form of ICD to the more established and evaluated method of heat-based ICD in experimentally infected and non-infected dogs. Plasma from class A dogs experimentally infected ∼4 months prior with D. immitis (infected; n = 24) and dogs reared indoors with no history of exposure to mosquitoes (non-infected; n = 75) were evaluated for presence of D. immitis antigen (DiroCHEK® Heartworm antigen test kit). Each sample was divided into three aliquots for testing: [1] Control plasma (no acid- or heat-treatment), [2] acid-treated plasma (trichloroacetic acid (TCA), incubation, centrifugation for 5 min at 16,000 X g, buffer), and [3] heat-treated plasma (104 °C followed by centrifugation at 16,000 X g). Treatments for each aliquot were performed and tested in triplicate; results were determined both visually (color change) and by spectrophotometric analysis (optical density [OD] value). Of the 24 infected dogs, 0/24 tested positive for antigen in the absence of acid- or heat-treatment. Those same plasma samples following processing by either acid- or heat-treatment yielded 18/24 (75.0%) and 19/24 (79.2%) antigen-positive results, respectively. Of the 75 plasma samples from non-infected dogs, neither acid- nor heat-treatment of plasma caused any false-positive color changes or spectrophotometric values. These results indicate that acid as a means of ICD reliably allowed for the detection of D. immitis antigen in infected plasma while not inducing false-positive results in non-infected plasma samples.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDirofilaria immitis 3aabsorbance 3aantigen-antibody complex 3aantigens 3acentrifugation 3acolor 3adissociation 3adogs 3aheat 3aheat treatment 3aspectral analysis 3atrichloroacetic acid 3aveterinary parasitology 0aAntigen-testing 0aFalse-negative 0aImmune-complex dissociation 0aHeartworm 0aSensitivity1 aBowles, J.V.1 aBlagburn, B.L.0 tVeterinary parasitology.g2020 June, v. 282 p.109134-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl11815x0304-40177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetpar.2020.1091343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04458naa a2200673 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003500135040001800170100001600188245016100204300001200365506007600377520218700453592002802640596005902668596008002727596009102807506003702898650001702935650001902952650001702971650002302988650001703011650002103028650001303049650001803062650002003080650002303100650002003123650003103143650001803174650001603192650001203208650002003220650001803240650003603258650001503294650001203309650004303321650000903364650001303373650001303386650002003399650002503419651001003444700001203454700001603466700001803482700001903500700005703519773010503576856008203681852000903763655001203772IND60676409720221207082139.0210119e201912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067640972DNAL7 a317304802pmid7 aPMC68587532pmcid7 a10.1186/s12870-019-2104-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLuo, Haowen10aFoliar application of sodium selenate induces regulation in yield formation, grain quality characters and 2-acetyl-1-pyrroline biosynthesis in fragrant rice  ap. 502.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Selenium (Se) is a beneficial element for higher plants and essential for mammals. To study the effect of the foliar application of sodium selenate on fragrant rice performance, a pot experiment was conducted in Guangdong, China. At the initial heading stage, one-time foliar application of sodium selenate with concentrations of 0, 10, 20, 30, 40 and 50 μmol·L⁻ ¹ (named CK, Se1, Se2, Se3, Se4 and Se5, respectively) were foliar applied on two fragrant rice varieties, ‘Meixiangzhan-2’ and ‘Xiangyaxiangzhan’. RESULTS: Selenate application at the initial heading stage not only improved the grain yield of fragrant rice by increasing the seed-setting rate and grain weight, but also promoted the grain quality by increasing crude protein contents and lowering the chalky rice rate. Furthermore, Se applications enhanced the biosynthesis of 2-acetyl-1- pyrroline (2-AP), the main aromatic compound, by increasing the contents of precursors (△1- pyrroline, proline and pyrroline-5-carboxylic acid (P5C)) and the activities of enzymes (proline dehydrogenase (PRODH), △1-pyrroline-5-carboxylic acid synthetase (P5CS), and ornithine aminotransferase (OAT)) in fragrant rice. The results also showed that foliar application of sodium selenate enhanced the antioxidant system of both varieties by promoting the activities of peroxidase (POD), superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and reducing the contents of malondialdehyde (MDA). Furthermore, the real-time PCR analyses depicted that foliar application of selenate up-regulated the GPX1, GPX4 and CATC transcripts. The higher antioxidative enzymatic activities might strength the stress resistant to ensure the stability of yield in fragrant rice form abiotic stress. CONCLUSIONS: Foliar applications of sodium selenate at the initial heading stage increased the grain 2-AP content by enhancing the biosynthesis-related enzymes and precursors. The grain yield and quality of fragrant rice also increased due to selenate application. Furthermore, foliar application of selenate promoted the activities of enzymes such as POD, SOD and CAT and up-regulated the expression of gene GPX4, GPX1 and CATC.  aPublisher supplied data  a31971843cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a2017 LM1098cTechnology System of Modern Agricultural Industry in Guangdong  a0724-1510A08N3684cWorld Bank Loan Agricultural Pollution Control Project in Guangdong0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aOryza sativa 3aabiotic stress 3aantioxidants 3aaromatic compounds 3abiosynthesis 3acarboxylic acids 3acatalase 3acrude protein 3aenzyme activity 3afoliar application 3agene expression 3agene expression regulation 3agrain quality 3agrain yield 3aheading 3amalondialdehyde 3amessenger RNA 3aornithine-oxo-acid transaminase 3aperoxidase 3aproline 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3arice 3aseed set 3aselenium 3asodium selenate 3asuperoxide dismutase 3aChina1 aDu, Bin1 aHe, Longxin1 aZheng, Axiang1 aPan, Shenggang1 aTang, Xiangru1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7943-44740 tBMC plant biology.g2019 Dec., v. 19, no. 1 p.502-502dBioMed CentralwJournal:2167x1471-22297nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12870-019-2104-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02907naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001900144245012300163300002000286520127900306592002801585596010701613650003001720650002101750650001101771650001301782650001501795653002701810653001501837653002101852653002401873653002501897700001501922700001401937700001501951700001401966700001801980700001601998700001902014700005702033700005702090700006002147773014202207856007902349852000902428655001202437IND60774632720221119135348.0220421e20220408xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077463272DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.2c018132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYuan, Xiangbao10aEnhanced p-Type Conductivity of NiOₓ Films with Divalent Cd Ion Doping for Efficient Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells  ap. 17434-17443.  aThe effect of substitutional metal dopants in NiOₓ on the structural and electronic structures is of great interest, particularly for increasing the p-type conductivities as a hole transport layer (HTL) applied in perovskite solar cells (PSCs). In this paper, experimental fabrications and density functional theory calculations have been carried out on Cd-doped NiOₓ films to examine the effect of divalent doping on the electronic and geometric structures of NiOₓ. The results indicate that divalent Cd dopants reduced the formation energy of the Ni vacancy (VNᵢ) and created more VNᵢ in the films, which enhanced the p-type conductivity of the NiOₓ films. In addition, Cd doping also deepened the valence band edge, reduced the monomolecular Shockley–Read–Hall (SRH) recombination losses, and promoted hole extraction and transport. Hence, the PSCs with Cd:NiOₓ HTLs manifest a high efficiency of 20.47%, a high photocurrent density of 23.00 mA cm–², and a high fill factor of 79.62%, as well as negligible hysteresis and excellent stability. This work illustrates that divalent elements such as Cd, Zn, Co, etc. may be potential dopants to improve the p-type conductivity of the NiOₓ films for applications in highly efficient and stabilized PSCs.  aPublisher supplied data  acstc2019jcyj-msxmX0572cNatural Science Foundation of Chongqingdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100005230 3adensity functional theory 3aelectric current 3aenergy 3ageometry 3ahysteresis 0aperovskite solar cells 0adoped NiOx 0adivalent Cd ions 0ap-type conductivity 0ahole transport layer1 aLi, Haiyun1 aFan, Jing1 aZhang, Lin1 aRan, Feng1 aFeng, Menglei1 aLi, Peiyuan1 aKong, Weixiang1 aChen, Shijian1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9523-66861 aZang, Zhigang1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1632-503X1 aWang, Shuangpeng1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8464-49940 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2022 Apr. 08, v. 14, no. 15 p.17434-17443dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.2c018133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02556naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001400144245013100158300002000289520124600309592002801555650001501583650002201598650001301620650001401633653001701647653003101664653001601695653002001711700001401731700006001745700001801805700001801823700001701841700001601858700005401874773014201928856007902070852000902149655001202158IND60771084120221119161858.0220323e20220309xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077108412DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.1c245732doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMa, Liang10aArtificial Monovalent Metal Ion-Selective Fluidic Devices Based on Crown Ether@Metal–Organic Frameworks with Subnanochannels  ap. 13611-13621.  aPrecise regulation of ion transport through nanoscale pores will profoundly impact diverse fields from separation to energy conversion but is still challenging to achieve in artificial ion channels. Herein, inspired by the exquisite ion selectivity of biological Na⁺ channels, we have successfully fabricated hierarchically grown metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) on an asymmetrical substrate assisted by atomically thin nanoporous graphene. Efficient separation of monovalent metal ions is realized by encapsulating 18-crown-6 into MOF crystals. The resulting 18-crown-6@ZIF-67/ZIF-8 device, with subnanochannels and specific K⁺ binding sites, shows an ultrahigh Li⁺ conductivity of 1.46 × 10–² S cm–¹ and selectivities of 9.56 and 6.43 for Li⁺/K⁺ and Na⁺/K⁺, respectively. The Li⁺ conductivity is around 1–2 orders of magnitude higher than reported values for the other MOF materials. It is the first time that MOFs with subnanochannels realize selective transport of Na⁺ (ionic diameter of 1.9 Å) over K⁺ (2.6 Å) based on subangstrom differences in their ionic diameter. Our work opens new avenues to develop crown ether@MOF platforms toward efficient ion transistors, fluidic logic devices, and biosensors.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiosensors 3aenergy conversion 3agraphene 3ananopores 0aion channels 0ametal−organic frameworks 0acrown ether 0afluidic devices1 aHan, Xiao1 aZhang, Shengping1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4175-68701 aZeng, Zhiyang1 aSong, Ruiyang1 aChen, Xiaobo1 aHou, Dandan1 aWang, Luda1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6222-78070 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2022 Mar. 09, v. 14, no. 11 p.13611-13621dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.1c245733Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03700naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100006800150245014900218500001900367520190600386592002802292650003002320650001102350650001702361650002102378650001602399650001502415650002202430650001202452650001502464650001502479650002002494650002902514650001602543650000902559650001202568650001702580650002802597653004902625653002502674653005002699653001602749700006302765700002702828700002202855700001602877700002702893700003602920773010802956856008503064852000903149655001203158IND60696652420221118051218.0200824e202006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069665242DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vetpar.2020.1091382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aObi, Chukwunonso Francis1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9381-438210aAzithromycin and Diminazene Aceturate Combination Therapy in Experimental Multidrug-resistant Trypanosoma brucei brucei Infection in Albino Rats  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aAzithromycin and diminazene aceturate combination therapy in experimental multidrug-resistant Trypanosoma brucei brucei infection in albino rats was evaluated. A total of forty-five female albino rats were used. These rats were randomly assigned to nine groups of five rats each. Group 1 was the uninfected-untreated group while groups 2 - 6 were infected with 1 × 10⁶ trypanosomes suspended in 0.3 ml of normal saline intraperitoneally. Following infection and parasitaemia, group 2 was untreated while group 3 was treated once with 7 mg/kg diminazene aceturate. Groups 4 - 6 were treated with 10, 20 and 30 mg/kg azithromycin respectively for 7 days. Groups 7 - 9 were treated with combination of 7 mg/kg diminazene aceturate (DA) once and 10, 20 and 30 mg/kg azithromycin (AZT) respectively for 7 days. Level of parasitaemia, haematological indices (packed cell volume, total erythrocyte count, total leukocyte count, haemoglobin concentration, mean corpuscular volume, mean corpuscular hemoglobin, mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration), survivability, body weight and rectal temperature were used to assess the effectiveness of the combination therapy. A significant reduction in parasitaemia levels was observed in the DA-treated group and AZT-treated group 6 while clearance of parasitaemia was observed in the DA-AZT treated groups 7 – 9 for periods between 1 and 5 days post treatment. The haematological indices and survivability of the DA-AZT treated groups were better than the DA-treated group despite the relapse recorded in those groups. One rat each in the DA-AZT combination groups survived till the end of the experiment. In conclusion, the DA-AZT combination treatment can be used as a possible adjunct to DA in the treatment of multidrug-resistant T. brucei brucei. The combination also enhanced survivability and decreased the effect of the disease in rats.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTrypanosoma brucei brucei 3aalbino 3aazithromycin 3abody temperature 3abody weight 3adiminazene 3aerythrocyte count 3afemales 3ahematocrit 3ahemoglobin 3aleukocyte count 3amultiple drug resistance 3aparasitemia 3arats 3arelapse 3atherapeutics 3aveterinary parasitology 0aMultidrug-resistant Trypanosoma bruceibrucei 0aDiminazene aceturate 0aDiminazene aceturate-Azithromycin combination 0aAlbino rats1 aEzeh, Ikenna Onyema1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1771-00441 aOkpala, Michael Ikenna1 aIdika, Idika Kalu1 aMbe, Nnamdi1 aNwobi, Lotanna Gilbert1 aEzeokonkwo, Romanus Chukwuduruo0 tVeterinary parasitology.g2020 June, v. 282 p.109138-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl11815x0304-40177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetpar.2020.1091383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02335naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001500150245010900165300001600274520113600290592002801426650001401454650000901468650001501477650001801492650001801510650001401528650001101542650001201553650001201565653002301577653002601600653002201626653001101648653002901659700001601688700001701704700001501721773008401736856008401820852000901904655001201913IND60556578420221117183432.0161102e201611  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055657842DNAL7 a10.1016/j.powtec.2016.04.0452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhu, Liyun10aComparative study of hydrodynamic and mixing behaviors in different pre-lifting schemes for an FCC riser  ap. 557-567.  aA comprehensive study of hydrodynamic behavior including the particle mass flow rate, solid volume fraction and particle velocity, as well as the mixing behavior, was conducted in the pre-lifting scheme with a central tube and the scheme without a central tube. Compared with the pre-lifting scheme without a central tube, higher mass flow rate, more uniform flow structure, and more vigorous gas-solid contact behaviors were obtained in the riser entrance region of the pre-lifting scheme with a central tube. The suggested installation height for the feedstock nozzles was lower in the pre-lifting scheme with a central tube as determined by analyzing the radial non-uniformity index of catalyst particles distributions. However, relatively complete and desirable mixing of cold and hot particles was presented in the pre-lifting scheme without a central tube by analysis of the distributions of heat exchange uniformity. Finally, the key hydrodynamic and mixing features were summarized, and some optimized structures over the pre-lifting scheme with a central tube were proposed to improve the mixing of cold and hot particles.  aPublisher supplied data 3acatalysts 3acold 3afeedstocks 3aheat transfer 3ahydrodynamics 3amass flow 3amixing 3anozzles 3apowders 0aPre-lifting scheme 0aSolid volume fraction 0aParticle velocity 0aMixing 0aHeat exchange uniformity1 aFan, Yiping1 aWang, Zhenbo1 aLu, Chunxi0 tPowder technology.g2016 Nov., v. 301 p.557-567dElsevier B.V.x0032-59107nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.powtec.2016.04.0453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01967naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002000142245006600162300001600228520106000244592002801304650002601332650001701358650002001375650002101395700002201416700002501438773012801463856007701591852000901668655001201677IND60773672220221116193359.0220714e20220328xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077367222DNAL7 a10.17221/20/2022-pps2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPalicová, Jana10aObituary of Professor Ing.

Based on the high effectiveness of the combination of daptomycin (DAP) plus RIF against meticillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) in this setting, in this study the efficacy of DAP+RIF and DAP+LVX combinations was tested as alternative therapies for foreign-body infections (FBIs) caused by MSSA. A tissue-cage infection model was performed using an MSSA strain. Male Wistar rats were treated for 7 days with LVX, DAP, RIF or the combinations LVX+RIF, DAP+RIF and DAP+LVX. Antibiotic efficacy was evaluated by bacterial counts from tissue cage fluid (TCF) and the cure rate was determined from adhered bacteria. Resistance was screened. Monotherapies were less effective than combinations (P<0.05), and resistance to DAP and RIF emerged. DAP+RIF (decrease in bacterial counts in TCF, −4.9logCFU/mL; cure rate, 92%) was the most effective therapy (P<0.05). There were no differences between LVX+RIF (−3.4logCFU/mL; 11%) and DAP+LVX (−3.3logCFU/mL; 47%). No resistant strains appeared with combined therapies. In conclusion, the combinations DAP+RIF and DAP+LVX showed good efficacy and prevented resistance. DAP+RIF provided higher efficacy than LVX+RIF. These DAP combinations were efficacious alternatives therapies for MSSA FBI. Further studies should confirm whether DAP+RIF may be useful as a first-line therapy in the setting of PJI caused by MSSA.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalternative medicine 3abacteria 3adaptomycin 3alevofloxacin 3amales 3amethicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus 3amodels 3aplate count 3aprostheses 3arats 3arifampicin 0aForeign-body infection 0aCombination therapy 0aMSSA 0aDaptomycin1 aMurillo, Oscar1 aRibera, Alba1 aVivas, Mireia1 aGarcia-Somoza, Dolors1 aTubau, Fe1 aCabellos, Carmen1 aCabo, Javier1 aAriza, Javier0 tInternational journal of antimicrobial agents.g2015 Aug., v. 46, no. 2 p.189-195dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12451x0924-85797nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijantimicag.2015.04.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01319naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100003100151245007500182300001600257520027700273592002800550650000900578650001000587653000700597653000700604653000700611653001400618653001800632653002000650653002900670653002100699653001800720700002000738773010500758856008500863852000900948655001200957IND60599823520221118010603.0180702e201408  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059982352DNAL7 a10.1016/j.econlet.2014.05.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGangopadhyay, Shubhashish,10aAsymmetric group loans, non-assortative matching and adverse selection  ap. 185-187.  aThis paper shows that an asymmetric group debt contract, where one borrower co-signs for another, but not vice versa, leads to heterogeneous matching.

Usually, NL needs to be dispersed into an alcoholic solution when applied. Nevertheless, a back-migration phenomenon of NL to the surface of the stone and delayed carbonation of NL enabled by alcohol do not guarantee good preservation effects. Dispersing NL into water can avoid the above issues. However, NL water suspension shows extremely poor kinetic stability, greatly restricting the penetration of NL into stone relics as well as bringing unfavorable impacts to the treated stone heritage. Here, we develop a facile method to synthesize polydopamine (PDA)-modified NL (PDA@NL). Characterizations demonstrate that PDA is uniformly distributed on the surface of NL particles though hydrogen bonds. In addition, the presence of PDA reduces the size of NL particles and achieves the highest specific surface area of NL reported to date. More importantly, water suspension of PDA@NL is far more stable than that of pure NL. The kinetic stability mechanism of PDA@NL in water is attributed to the lessened spatial interactions between NL particles, which is realized by the coverage of PDA on the surface of NL particles. Furthermore, the coverage of PDA does not inhibit carbonation. Within 105 h, NL in PDA@NL completes carbonation and obtains 93.7% calcite, which is comparable to that of NL suspension. Permeability tests prove that the PDA@NL suspension penetrates far deeper through stone specimens compared with the NL suspension. Additionally, PDA@NL presents good consolidation performances for stone samples. Our work opens a new direction for the modification of NL that will boost the studies of NL-modified materials as well as the conservation of cultural heritage.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalcohols 3acalcite 3acarbonation 3acultural heritage 3ahydrogen 3apermeability 3asurface area 0ananolime 0akinetic stability 0apolydopamine 0astone relic 0aconsolidation1 aJia, Cong1 aLi, Yuke1 aZhang, Peiyao1 aDing, Jinghan1 aXu, Gang1 aZhao, Xichen1 aLi, Xuanhua1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3243-35670 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2022 Mar. 11, v. 14, no. 11 p.13622-13630dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.1c246993Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02957naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100006000150245011100210300001800321520161100339592002801950650002001978650001501998650001302013650002202026650001802048650001302066650001102079650001202090650001302102650001202115650001702127650001302144653001702157653001802174653001602192653001602208653001002224653001102234700001902245700002102264700002302285773008602308856008402394852000902478655001202487IND60556578620221117183512.0161102e201611  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055657862DNAL7 a10.1016/j.powtec.2016.05.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFrancia, Víctor1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8819-663910aAgglomeration in counter-current spray drying towers. Part B: Interaction between multiple spraying levels  ap. 1344-1358.  aA new experimental method is developed here to investigate agglomeration in spray drying towers operating with multiple nozzles. It allows studying independently the contribution of each spray to the product and obtaining a valuable insight into the agglomeration processes. The paper studies a two level swirl counter-current dryer of detergent in a full-scale production system. It shows that operation with two nozzle levels increases the energy efficiency compared to the use of single sprays, but in turn promotes both agglomeration and elutriation of powder from the top of the dryer. The product size distribution becomes bi-modal and the composition and porosity of the product more heterogeneous due to the different thermal histories experienced by droplets from each spray. The method described here controls the air temperature and humidity nearby the nozzles to quantify the agglomerates resulting from particle contacts within each individual spray or from their interaction. Particle agglomeration is shown to be suppressed at the bottom of the dryer where the heat transfer rates are highest and promoted at the top spray, which originates a second coarse mode in the size distribution. Both levels do not operate independently; the powder elutriated upwards from the bottom nozzle is captured entirely by the top spray when it is centrally located. By isolating the independent impact of each nozzle in a dryer, the method provides powerful data to correlate the agglomeration behaviour with local process conditions, and so facilitate the development and validation of spray dryer models.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair temperature 3adetergents 3adroplets 3aenergy efficiency 3aheat transfer 3ahumidity 3amodels 3anozzles 3aporosity 3apowders 3aspray drying 3aspraying 0aSpray drying 0aAgglomeration 0aAggregation 0aCoalescence 0aSpray 0aNozzle1 aMartín, Luis,1 aBayly, Andrew E.1 aSimmons, Mark J.H.0 tPowder technology.g2016 Nov., v. 301 p.1344-1358dElsevier B.V.x0032-59107nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.powtec.2016.05.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03013naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100006000145245010000205300001800305500001900323520143600342592002801778650001701806650001801823650002601841650001501867650001701882650001101899650003301910650001101943650002701954650002701981650001302008650002502021700005702046700005902103700006302162700006502225700006202290773013902352856007902491852000902570655001202579IND60695896320221117155631.0200519e20200504xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069589632DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.est.9b077742doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHolmquist, Hanna1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6213-075413aAn (Eco)Toxicity Life Cycle Impact Assessment Framework for Per- And Polyfluoroalkyl Substances  ap. 6224-6234.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aA framework for characterizing per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) in life cycle impact assessment (LCIA) is proposed. Thousands of PFASs are used worldwide, with special properties imparted by the fluorinated alkyl chain. Our framework makes it possible to characterize a large part of the family of PFASs by introducing transformation fractions that translate emissions of primary emitted PFASs into the highly persistent terminal degradation products: the perfluoroalkyl acids (PFAAs). Using a PFAA-adapted characterization model, human toxicity as well as marine and freshwater aquatic ecotoxicity characterization factors are calculated for three PFAAs, namely perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) perfluorohexanoic acid (PFHxA) and perfluorobutanesulfonic acid (PFBS). The model is evaluated to adequately capture long-term fate, where PFAAs are predicted to accumulate in open oceans. The characterization factors of the three PFAAs are ranked among the top 5% for marine ecotoxicity, when compared to 3104 chemicals in the existing USEtox results databases. Uncertainty analysis indicates potential for equally high ranks for human health impacts. Data availability constitutes an important limitation creating uncertainties. Even so, a life cycle assessment (LCA) case study illustrates practical application of our proposed framework, demonstrating that even low emissions of PFASs can have large effects on LCA results.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase studies 3aecotoxicology 3aenvironmental science 3afreshwater 3ahuman health 3ahumans 3alife cycle impact assessment 3amodels 3aperfluorohexanoic acid 3aperfluorooctanoic acid 3atoxicity 3auncertainty analysis1 aFantke, Peter1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7148-69821 aCousins, Ian T.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7035-86601 aOwsianiak, Mikołaj1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6834-62491 aLiagkouridis, Ioannis1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1204-54951 aPeters, Gregory M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8319-168X0 tEnvironmental science & technology.g2020 May 04, v. 54, no. 10 p.6224-6234dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23339x1520-58517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.9b077743Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02379naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002400150245013800174520082000312592002801132650001401160650002701174650004401201650002201245650001801267650001701285650001901302650001901321650001301340650001901353650002601372650001501398653001701413653002401430653001801454653001601472700002801488700001701516700002901533700002501562700002701587700002101614700002401635700002801659773010401687856008501791852000901876655001201885IND60743565220221122025846.0211106e202111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074356522DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envres.2021.1116472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIndira, Karuppusamy10aPhotocatalytic degradation of congo red dye using nickel–titanium dioxide nanoflakes synthesized by Mukia madrasapatna leaf extract  aSemiconductor photocatalysts are efficient degraders of organic and inorganic waste water pollutants.

But the plant viruses have learnt to suppress gene silencing by encoding the protein(s), called RNA silencing suppressor(s) (RSS). Hence, these proteins could be used to overcome the limitation for transgene expression. The RNAi suppressors, namely HC-Pro and P19, have been shown to enhance the transgene expression but other RSS proteins have not been screened for similar role. Moreover, none of RSSs from the DNA viruses are known for enhancing the expression of transgenes. The Mungbean Yellow Mosaic India Virus (MYMIV) belonging to the genus Begomovirus within the family of Geminiviridae encodes an RSS called the AC2 protein. Here, we used AC2 to elevate the expression of the transgenes. Upon introduction of MYMIV-AC2 in the silenced GFP transgenic tobacco lines, by either genetic hybridisation or transgenesis, the GFP expression was enhanced several fold in F1 and T0 lines. The GFP-siRNA levels were much reduced in F1 and T0 lines compared with those of the initial parental silenced lines. The enhanced GFP expression was also observed at the cellular level. This approach was also successful in enhancing the expression of another transgene, namely topoisomeraseII.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBegomovirus 3aRNA interference 3agene expression 3ahybridization 3amung beans 3aplant viruses 3aproteins 3ascreening 3atobacco 3atransgenes 2aDNA Topoisomerases, Type IIxgenetics 2aGeminiviridaexgenetics 2aGene Expressionxgenetics 2aGenetic Engineeringxmethods 2aGreen Fluorescent Proteinsxdeficiencyxgenetics. 2aHybridization, Genetic 2aProtoplastsxmetabolism 2aRNA Interference 2aTobaccoxcytologyxgenetics. 2aTransgenesxgenetics 2aViral Proteinsxgenetics 3aIndia1 aKarjee, Sumona1 aMukherjee, Sunil Kumar0 tApplied biochemistry and biotechnology.g2012 June, v. 167, no. 4 p.758-775dSpringer-Verlagx0273-22897nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12010-012-9702-z  aDNAL 7aarticle05798naa a2200769 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001700094024002300111024003700134024002300171024004100194024002500235040001800260100005900278245013400337520335500471592002803826650003303854650001103887650002503898650000903923650001503932650001103947650001403958650001903972650001303991650001404004650001204018650001404030650001704044650001004061650002004071650001104091650002304102650001604125650001204141650004304153650001404196650001304210650001504223650001404238650001104252650002104263650001504284651001604299653002304315653001104338653001404349653001004363700006404373700002104437700001504458700001604473700001604489700001404505700001904519700006004538700005904598773013204657856011404789856008404903961002004987852000905007655001205016IND60791768720221214224105.0220831e20220901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079176872DNAL7 a3889562aris7 a10113/79176872hdl7 a10.1094/PDIS-10-21-2152-PDN2doi7 a3889562seq_no_1157 a2072-22000-041-000D2aris_project_no7 a4324692aris_accn_no  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPeterson, E.

Of these, three – the NA1, NA2, and EU1 lineages – are found in U.S. nurseries, but only two, the NA1 and EU1 lineages, have been found infecting trees in North American forests (Grünwald et al. 2012, 2016). In the spring of 2021, tanoak (Notholithocarpus densiflorus Manos, Cannon & Oh) displaying symptoms consistent with SOD were detected north of Port Orford (Curry County, Oregon). Symptoms were canopy dieback and blackened petiole and stem lesions on tanoak sprouts. The pathogen isolated on PAR (corn meal agar plus 200 ml/liter of ampicillin, 10 mg/liter of rifamycin, 66.7 mg/liter of pentachloronitrobenzene) selective media was determined to be P. ramorum based on characteristic morphology of hyphae, sporangia, and chlamydospores (Werres et al. 2001). Positive identification as P. ramorum was obtained with a LAMP assay targeting a lineage-specific NA2 gene, indicating the presence of the NA2 lineage. NA2 was confirmed by sequencing a portion of the cellulose binding elicitor lectin (CBEL) gene using CBEL5U and CBEL6L primers (Gagnon et al. 2014). Sequences (GenBank accessions MZ733981 and MZ733982) were aligned against reference sequences for all lineages (Gagnon et al. 2014), confirming the presence of NA2. Lineage determination as NA2 was further confirmed at 11 SSR loci (ILVOPrMS145, PrMS39, PrMS9C3, ILVOPrMS79, KI18, KI64, PrMS45, PrMS6, ILVOPrMS131, KI82ab, and PrMS43) using the methods of Kamvar et al. (2015). We completed Koch’s postulates using potted tanoaks, wound-inoculated at the midpoint of 1-year old stems with either hyphal plugs or noncolonized agar (n = 4 per treatment). Tanoaks were maintained in a growth chamber (20°C-day/18°C-night temperatures) with regular watering and an 18-h photoperiod using F32T8 fluorescent bulbs (Phillips, Eindhoven, The Netherlands). After 7 days, brown to black lesions 1.2 to 2.9 cm in length were observed on the inoculated stems, from which P. ramorum was subsequently reisolated; no symptoms were observed on the controls, and no pathogens were recovered when plating the wound sites in PAR. This is the first detection of the NA2 lineage causing disease in forests worldwide. The outbreak was found on private and public lands in forests typical to the SOD outbreak in Oregon (mixed conifer and tanoak), and was 33 km north of the closest known P. ramorum infestation. Follow-up ground surveys on adjacent lands have identified over 100 P. ramorum-positive tanoak trees, from which additional NA2 isolates have been recovered from bole cankers. NA2 is thought to be more aggressive than the NA1 lineage (Elliott et al. 2011), which has been present in Curry County since the mid-1990s (Goheen et al. 2017). Eradication of the NA2 lineage is being pursued to slow its further spread and prevent overlap with existing NA1 and EU1 populations. The repeated introductions of novel lineages into the western United States native plant communities highlights the vulnerability of this region to Phytophthora establishment, justifying continued monitoring for P. ramorum in nurseries and forests.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNotholithocarpus densiflorus 3aOregon 3aPhytophthora ramorum 3aagar 3aampicillin 3acanopy 3acellulose 3achlamydospores 3aconifers 3acorn meal 3adieback 3aelicitors 3afluorescence 3agenes 3agrowth chambers 3ahyphae 3aindigenous species 3aleaf blight 3alectins 3aloop-mediated isothermal amplification 3apathogens 3apetioles 3aquintozene 3asporangia 3aspring 3asudden oak death 3atree trunk 3aNetherlands 0adisease management 0aforest 0aoomycetes 0atrees1 aGrunwald, Niklaus J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1656-76021 aSøndreli, K.

In response to DNA damage, bacteria induce an SOS response to stimulate DNA repair. However, the SOS response may also induce prophage with production of infectious virions. Salmonella strains typically contain multiple prophages, and certain strains including phage types DT120 and DT104 contain prophage that upon induction are capable of generalised transduction. In this study, strains of multidrug-resistant (MDR) Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium DT120 and DT104 were exposed to fluoroquinolones important for use in human and veterinary disease therapy to determine whether prophage(s) are induced that could facilitate phage-mediated gene transfer. Cultures of MDR S. Typhimurium DT120 and DT104 containing a kanamycin resistance plasmid were lysed after exposure to fluoroquinolones (ciprofloxacin, enrofloxacin and danofloxacin). Bacterial cell lysates were able to transfer the plasmid to a recipient kanamycin-susceptible Salmonella strain by generalised transduction. In addition, exposure of DT120 to ciprofloxacin induced the recA gene of the bacterial SOS response and genes encoded in a P22-like generalised transducing prophage. This research indicates that fluoroquinolone exposure of MDR Salmonella can facilitate horizontal gene transfer, suggesting that fluoroquinolone usage in human and veterinary medicine may have unintended consequences, including the induction of phage-mediated gene transfer from MDR Salmonella. Stimulation of gene transfer following bacterial exposure to fluoroquinolones should be considered an adverse effect, and clinical decisions regarding antibiotic selection for infectious disease therapy should include this potential risk.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA damage 3aDNA repair 3aDNA topoisomerase (ATP-hydrolysing) 3aSalmonella Typhimurium 3aadverse effects 3abacteria 3abacteriophages 3acell death 3aciprofloxacin 3adanofloxacin 3aenrofloxacin 3aenzyme activity 3agene transfer 3agenes 3ahorizontal gene transfer 3ahumans 3ainfectious diseases 3akanamycin 3amultiple drug resistance 3aplasmids 3arisk 3atherapeutics 3aveterinary medicine 3avirion 0aSalmonella 0aBacteriophage 0aFluoroquinolone 0aProphage 0aGene transfer 0aTransduction1 aBrunelle, Brian W.0 tInternational journal of antimicrobial agents.g2015 Aug., v. 46, no. 2 p.201-204dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12451x0924-85797nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijantimicag.2015.04.0083Available from publisher's site40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/60489543Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  aARIS submissionbhttps://submit.nal.usda.gov/system/files/submissions/nal%20312676%20Bearson%20fluoroquinolone%20induction%202015.pdf  aARIS submissionbhttps://submit.nal.usda.gov/system/files/submissions/NAL%20312676%20Bearson%20fluoroquinolone%20induction%20of%20phage-mediated.pdf  aUSDAUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle03200naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002100153245011200174300001800286520185400304592002802158650001302186650001202199650001202211650001202223650001302235650001602248650001302264650001502277650001002292650001902302650002602321650001502347650001402362650001702376650001602393650001202409700005702421700001702478700001802495700001402513773011902527856008702646852000902733655001202742IND60637502420190520000000.0190418e20190226xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063750242DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.energyfuels.8b034102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVinet-Cantot, J.10aStripping at the Bitumen–Aggregate Interface: A Laboratory Method To Assess the Loss of Chemical Adhesion  ap. 2641-2650.  aMoisture damage, cracking, and deformation are the three chief distresses caused by traffic and climate during the service life of an asphalt pavement. One manifestation of moisture damage is the loss of bond between bitumen and aggregate, resulting in the displacement of the bitumen in a process called stripping. While numerous tests try to evaluate moisture damage in the laboratory, most of them show poor correlation with field performance. A fuller understanding of stripping is still needed to enable paving technologists to predict and prevent the effects of moisture damage. This study aims to develop a new stripping resistance evaluation technique, wherein adhesion is measured exclusively as a function of the chemical interaction between bitumen and aggregate. A key element of the evaluation technique discussed herein uses a time-lapse image analysis method to characterize the dynamic wetting of precisely applied bitumen droplets on the surfaces of polished mineral aggregates during immersion in a thermo-regulated water bath. At fixed water immersion temperatures, the applied bitumen droplets contract and the image analysis technique allows for measurement of the change with time in the surface area of the contracting bitumen droplet. Different bitumen–aggregate pairs were used in this study. This technique allows for the bitumen–aggregate pairs to be ranked according to their resistance to moisture damage. This technique also allows for the calculation of stripping kinetics and the loss of the bitumen–aggregate adhesive bond of nine samples in exactly the same conditions. Repeatability of the new method is reported. Lastly, the results of the dynamic stripping analyses are compared to the results from the boiling water test on the loose mixture to compare ranking of performances according to the mineralogy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadhesion 3abitumen 3aboiling 3aclimate 3acracking 3adeformation 3adroplets 3adurability 3afuels 3aimage analysis 3alaboratory techniques 3amineralogy 3apavements 3asurface area 3atemperature 3atraffic1 aGaudefroy, V.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3361-94511 aDelfosse, F.1 aChailleux, E.1 aCrews, E.0 tEnergy & fuels.g2019 Feb. 26, v. 33, no. 4 p.2641-2650dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23338x1520-50297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.energyfuels.8b034103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03588naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245012600166300001600292520179200308592002802100650001802128650001902146650002102165650002202186650002502208650001302233650000902246650002202255650000902277650001902286650002002305650001602325650001302341650002202354650002202376650001002398650001702408650001702425650002302442650002202465650001102487650001002498650002402508650002302532650001202555650002402567650002002591650000902611650001202620650002802632650001102660700001902671700001902690700001702709700001902726773011502745856008102860852000902941655001202950IND60572866520221117055118.0170725e201702  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057286652DNAL7 a10.1007/s00394-015-1064-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWong, Weng-Yew10aAnti-inflammatory γ- and δ-tocotrienols improve cardiovascular, liver and metabolic function in diet-induced obese rats  ap. 133-150.  aPURPOSE: This study tested the hypothesis that γ- and δ-tocotrienols are more effective than α-tocotrienol and α-tocopherol in attenuating the signs of diet-induced metabolic syndrome in rats. METHODS: Five groups of rats were fed a corn starch-rich (C) diet containing 68 % carbohydrates as polysaccharides, while the other five groups were fed a diet (H) high in simple carbohydrates (fructose and sucrose in food, 25 % fructose in drinking water, total 68 %) and fats (beef tallow, total 24 %) for 16 weeks. Separate groups from each diet were supplemented with either α-, γ-, δ-tocotrienol or α-tocopherol (85 mg/kg/day) for the final 8 of the 16 weeks. RESULTS: H rats developed visceral obesity, hypertension, insulin resistance, cardiovascular remodelling and fatty liver. α-Tocopherol, α-, γ- and δ-tocotrienols reduced collagen deposition and inflammatory cell infiltration in the heart. Only γ- and δ-tocotrienols improved cardiovascular function and normalised systolic blood pressure compared to H rats. Further, δ-tocotrienol improved glucose tolerance, insulin sensitivity, lipid profile and abdominal adiposity. In the liver, these interventions reduced lipid accumulation, inflammatory infiltrates and plasma liver enzyme activities. Tocotrienols were measured in heart, liver and adipose tissue showing that chronic oral dosage delivered tocotrienols to these organs despite low or no detection of tocotrienols in plasma. CONCLUSION: In rats, δ-tocotrienol improved inflammation, heart structure and function, and liver structure and function, while γ-tocotrienol produced more modest improvements, with minimal changes with α-tocotrienol and α-tocopherol. The most important mechanism of action is likely to be reduction in organ inflammation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabdominal fat 3aadipose tissue 3aalpha-tocopherol 3aalpha-tocotrienol 3abiochemical pathways 3acollagen 3acorn 3adelta-tocotrienol 3adiet 3adrinking water 3aenzyme activity 3afatty liver 3afructose 3agamma-tocotrienol 3aglucose tolerance 3aheart 3ahypertension 3ainflammation 3ainsulin resistance 3alipid composition 3alipids 3aliver 3amechanism of action 3ametabolic syndrome 3aobesity 3aoral administration 3apolysaccharides 3arats 3asucrose 3asystolic blood pressure 3atallow1 aWard, Leigh C.1 aFong, Chee Wai1 aYap, Wei Ney1 aBrown, Lindsay0 tEuropean journal of nutrition.g2017 Feb., v. 56, no. 1 p.133-150dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx1436-62077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00394-015-1064-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03097naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002200144242018000166245012700346300001600473520178700489592002802276650001902304650002102323650001302344650001702357650000902374650001002383650001502393650002002408650001302428650001102441653001602452653002102468653001102489773012402500856007802624852000902702655001202711IND60694547520221116185632.0200513e20140101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069454752DNAL7 a10.3896/IBRA.1.53.4.152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFerrari, Thomas E10aLos imanes, las fluctuaciones de campos magnéticos y las perturbaciones geomagnéticas afectan la habilidad para volver a la colmena de las abejas melíferas (Apis mellifera)10aMagnets, magnetic field fluctuations and geomagnetic disturbances impair the homing ability of honey bees (Apis mellifera)  ap. 452-465.  aAdult honey bees possess a magnetoreception sense similar to other animals such as birds, fish, whales, dolphins, insects, and microbes. Organisms use this sense for orientation purposes during migrations and traveling long distances. The sudden loss and disappearance of honey bees from a hive or apiary has been plaguing beekeepers for more than a century. This age-old disorder predates virtually all herbicides and pesticides, many diseases or pests and honey bee management protocols. To investigate possible involvement of a magnetoreception disorder (MRD) with loss of forager homing abilities: A. magnetized wires were glued to their abdomens; B. foragers were exposed to artificially induced fluctuating magnetic fields; and C. untreated foragers' return rates were monitored during naturally occurring disturbances to Earth's magnetosphere. Treated and untreated foragers were released at varying distances from their hives and their return rates were monitored. Significant differences in their return rates indicated that interactions existed between forager losses and exposure to both static and oscillating magnetic fields, as well as during fluctuations in the Earth's magnetosphere. In addition, D. decreases in untreated forager return rates also correlated with increasing intensity of extraterrestrial protons that entered Earth's atmosphere. Finally, winter colony losses in the northeast USA also correlated with annual geomagnetic storm occurrences. Collectively, these five observations indicate that coronal eruptions on the Sun are involved with interference of a forager's magnetoreception sense here on Earth. How abnormal magnetic fields and fluctuations relate to the epidemiology of honey bee losses is consistent with their behaviour and development.  aPublisher supplied data 3aApis mellifera 3aEarth atmosphere 3aapiaries 3aepidemiology 3afish 3ahoney 3ahoney bees 3amagnetic fields 3aresearch 3astorms 0aorientation 0amagnetoreception 0ahoming0 tJournal of apicultural research.g2014 Jan. 1, v. 53, no. 4 p.452-465dTaylor & FranciswJournal:12840x2078-69137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3896/IBRA.1.53.4.153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02637naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245012800169300001800297520121300315592002801528650001401556650001101570650001801581650002201599650003001621650001401651650001901665650003101684650001501715650001101730653001301741653001901754653003101773653002201804653002301826700001401849700001401863700001501877700001801892700001701910700001501927773013101942856008502073852000902158655001202167IND60559274320221120165340.0161205e20161205xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055927432DNAL7 a10.1021/acssuschemeng.6b005782doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Haojie10aVisualization of the Formation and 3D Porous Structure of Ag Doped MnO2 Aerogel Monoliths with High Photocatalytic Activity  ap. 6277-6287.  aOwing to their intriguing properties, aerogels with rich and hierarchical pore systems are best appreciated in catalysis, sensing, and separation technologies. Herein, a comprehensive study is presented for inorganic monolithic aerogel of Ag doped MnO₂ (Ag-MnO₂), synthesized solely out of nanowires of diameter ∼10 nm. We demonstrated a 3D image of the full bulk structure of the aerogel using X-ray computed tomography (μCT), providing a concise and statistical description of its porous structure for the first time. Interestingly, a flow-through supermacroporous system was observed as a result of freeze-drying. Owing to the rich pore system, the Ag-MnO₂ aerogel monolith exhibited photocatalytic degradation of organic water pollutants, which was superior in performance as compared to that of the MnO₂ powder and compressed Ag-MnO₂ pellet. A detailed study of photocatalytic mechanism was also carried out, indicating that Ag can simultaneously modulate the physical and chemical properties of MnO₂. This work highlights the significance of porous system in monolith catalysts, and provides insight into design and prepare metal oxide aerogels for environmental and energy applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3acatalysts 3aenergy 3afreeze drying 3amanganese dioxide 3amicro-computed tomography 3ananowires 3aphotocatalysis 3aphysicochemical properties 3apollutants 3asilver 0aAerogels 0aSupermacropore 0aPhotocatalytic degradation 0aManganese dioxide 0aInorganic nanowire1 aLin, Chao1 aHan, Ting1 aDu, Fuping1 aZhao, Yonghui1 aLi, Xiaopeng1 aSun, Yuhan0 tACS sustainable chemistry .g2016 Dec. 05, v. 4, no. 12 p.6277-6287dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23317x2168-04857nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acssuschemeng.6b005783Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02756naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002900155245017600184520138700360592002801747650002301775650001301798650002501811650002001836650001501856650001101871650000901882650001201891650002101903653001301924653002101937653002401958653001001982653003801992700002202030700003502052700001802087700002002105773011002125856009002235852000902325655001202334IND60752752620221123033051.0211030e202201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075275262DNAL7 a10.1016/j.landurbplan.2021.1042652doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMoore, Harriet Elizabeth10aRethinking the health implications of society-environment relationships in built areas: An assessment of the access to healthy and hazards index in the context of COVID-19  aUrban environments have been evolving to mitigate threats to the health and wellbeing of societies for thousands of years, including establishing open spaces to combat bubonic plague, improving waste management in the 20th century, and more recently retrofitting urban landscapes with green space to promote physical exercise. In the context of the current COVID-19 pandemic there is a need to rethink how societies interact with space in built environments to prevent contagion at the same time as facilitating health behaviours, such as exercise. Previously, we examined the spatial relationship between features of urban landscapes that are commonly considered to be ‘hazardous’ and ‘healthy’ and unusual clusters of COVID-19 cases in the East Midlands of the UK using ambulance data. Here, we consider the nature of social engagement that these features of urban landscapes facilitate and identify society-environment interactions that may increase risk of exposure to the virus. In some cases, spaces that are commonly thought to promote health behaviour may increase exposure. Contagion hot-spots occur at the nexus of exposure and underlying susceptibility. The viral-host dynamics of infectious disease are changing. Now, as in past eras, societies are required to evolve and adapt to the new challenges presented by emerging infectious diseases in the modern world.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCOVID-19 infection 3aexercise 3agreen infrastructure 3ahealth behavior 3alandscapes 3aplague 3arisk 3aviruses 3awaste management 0aCOVID-19 0aUrban landscapes 0aContagion hot-spots 0aAHAHI 0aSociety-environment relationships1 aHill, Bartholomew1 aSiriwardena, Aloysius Niroshan1 aTanser, Frank1 aSpaight, Robert0 tLandscape and urban planning.g2022 Jan., v. 217 p.104265-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12405x0169-20467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.landurbplan.2021.1042653Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02763naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001300155245010000168520140000268592002801668650001501696650002501711650001701736650001501753650001801768650002001786650001901806651001001825653001901835653002101854653003201875653002801907700001301935700001601948700001701964700001701981700001401998700001402012700001602026700001502042700001202057700001502069773011002084856009002194852000902284655001202293IND60752752720221123032937.0211030e202201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075275272DNAL7 a10.1016/j.landurbplan.2021.1042662doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Yi10aInequalities of urban green space area and ecosystem services along urban center-edge gradients  aRising inequality threatens the improvement of human well-being. As an important type of green infrastructure within cities, urban green spaces provide ecosystem services and contribute to human health. The inequalities of per capita urban green space area and ecosystem services are critical environmental justice and public health issues but are not well understood. Based on the spatial patterns of green spaces, land rent, and the population of 20 cities in China, we assessed the inequalities of per capita green space area and ecosystem services by using the Gini coefficient. Results showed that, (1) the Gini coefficient (an indicator to measure inequality) of per capita available ecosystem services was 0.430, which was greater than that of per capita green space area (0.357), (2) the inequality of per capita ecosystem services had a negative relationship with city size measured by population and GDP, and (3) the inequality of green space area was negatively related to the subjective quality of life, while the inequality of ecosystem services was negatively related to the economic competitiveness of cities. We suggest that urban planners comprehensively consider multiple indicators (such as per capita green space area, Gini coefficients of per capita green space area and ecosystem services) to simultaneously evaluate the efficiency and equality of green space construction.  aPublisher supplied data 3aecosystems 3agreen infrastructure 3ahuman health 3alandscapes 3apublic health 3aquality of life 3asocial welfare 3aChina 0aUrban planning 0aHuman well-being 0aCultural ecosystem services 0aEnvironmental injustice1 aGe, Ying1 aYang, Guofu1 aWu, Zhaoping1 aDu, Yuanyuan1 aMao, Feng1 aLiu, Shun1 aXu, Ronghua1 aQu, Zelong1 aXu, Bin1 aChang, Jie0 tLandscape and urban planning.g2022 Jan., v. 217 p.104266-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12405x0169-20467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.landurbplan.2021.1042663Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03648naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100006000153245008300213300001800296520221500314592002802529650004402557650001402601650001202615650001002627650002302637650001102660650002102671650002702692650001102719650003302730650001602763650002102779651001402800700003002814700002002844700002002864700002002884700002202904700002202926700002702948773011902975856008703094852000903181655001203190IND60637503020221117195821.0190418e20181228xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063750302DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.energyfuels.8b035592doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDaly, William H.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0825-779710aCharacterization of Crumb Rubber Modifiers after Dispersion in Asphalt Binders  ap. 2665-2679.  aBlending ground crumb rubber (CR) with the asphalt binder is an economical and sustainable method of binder modification. The objective of this paper was to evaluate the interaction between the asphalt binder and the three CR types at 170 and 190 °C. The three CR types, ambiently ground, cryogenically ground, and Ecorphalt (E-rubber), were blended with a Louisiana conventional PG 67-22 asphalt at two temperatures, 170 and 190 °C. The composition of the CR before and after treatment with asphalt was studied using thermogravimetric analysis. Gel permeation chromatography was used to study the molecular weight changes to the asphalt before and after rubber treatment. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy was used to study the aging characteristics of the CR-modified asphalt binder prepared at the two temperatures. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) shows the morphology of the rubbers before and after dispersion in the asphalt binder. Performance-grade tests of the CR/asphalt binder blends were used to characterize the rheological properties. E-rubber additive did allow for better dispersion of particles in the asphalt binder at a lower temperature than the other additives evaluated. Ground CR particles were comprised of favorable polyisoprene contents (minimum natural rubber content was 50%) for blending with the asphalt binder. An increase in the blending temperature from 170 to 190 °C resulted in a minimal increase in the favorable polyisoprene contents of CR/asphalt binder blends containing 5 and 10% E-rubber, which is likely to influence performance. Favorable polyisoprene contents of the CR/asphalt blends containing 10% ambiently ground CR did not change with the blending temperature, whereas that of the CR/asphalt blend containing 10% cryogenically ground increased with the blending temperature. The CR particles isolated from asphalt blends prepared at 190 °C were more swollen than those separated from asphalt blends prepared at 170 °C, as measured by SEM. Approximetely 73–87% of the E-rubber particles dissolved in the asphalt binder during blending, confirming that E-rubber had great compatibility with the binder chemistry and, hence, can improve performance.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aadditives 3abitumen 3afuels 3agel chromatography 3amixing 3amolecular weight 3arheological properties 3arubber 3ascanning electron microscopy 3atemperature 3athermogravimetry 3aLouisiana1 aBalamurugan, Sreelatha S.1 aNegulescu, Ioan1 aAkentuna, Moses1 aMohammad, Louay1 aCooper, Samuel B.1 aCooper, Samuel B.1 aBaumgardner, Gaylon L.0 tEnergy & fuels.g2018 Dec. 28, v. 33, no. 4 p.2665-2679dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23338x1520-50297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.energyfuels.8b035593Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02530naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024003600110024003600146040001800182100001600200245010100216300001600317520103000333592002801363650002301391650002501414650001401439650001501453650001901468650001201487650003001499650002801529650001301557650002401570651001901594651001801613653003501631653001201666653001701678653001401695653002101709653003601730653002001766653002101786700002101807773011601828852000901944856008301953655001202036IND8706696120221120104420.0181203e19870701xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND870669612DNAL7 a36264752pmid7 a10.1258/0023677877812687102doi4 a0023-6772(19870701)21:3L.267;1-  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWootton, R.10aRecord-keeping requirements of the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 and how to meet them  ap. 267-275.  aThe new Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 has significant implications in terms of record keeping. In many designated establishments, however, most of the records are already collected as part of good working practice and the new Act merely formalizes this situation. Recording the required information may be tedious, but it can be carried out using either a paper-based system or its computerized equivalent. The new legislation imposes no additional record-keeping requirements on personal licence holders and the real burden falls on the project licence holder, particularly for large projects involving several personal licence holders. In the case of an animal house operating a computerized system, considerable assistance with project record keeping can be given by the designated establishment and project status reports will be very helpful in this respect. Computerization also enables automatic production of cage labels which ensures uniformity of labelling and compliance with the Home Office guidelines.  aPublisher supplied data 3alaboratory animals 3alaws and regulations 3acomputers 3aguidelines 2aAnimal Welfare 2aAnimals 2aForms and Records Control 2aLegislation, Veterinary 2aRecords. 2aVeterinary Medicine 3aUnited Kingdom 0aGreat Britain 0aMANAGEMENT INFORMATION SYSTEMS 0aANIMALS 0aLABORATORIES 0aCOMPUTERS 0aANIMAL HUSBANDRY 0aORGANIZATION AND ADMINISTRATION 0aRECORDS CONTROL 0aANIMALS ACT 19861 aFlecknell, P.

This new technique utilizes a commercial mid-infrared external-cavity quantum cascade laser and a photoacoustic detector to monitor characteristic olefin C═C absorption bands in the ∼1640–1680 cm–¹ (5.95–6.1 μm) region. It is suitable for measurements of olefin concentrations in a variety of samples, including those derived from partially upgraded bitumen. To confirm this capability, olefin concentrations in the solutions of model compounds, thermally cracked and hydrotreated naphthas, and actual olefin-rich distillate samples were measured. This investigation showed that infrared lasers create a viable alternative to the conventional NMR and chemical methods widely used to determine the olefin contents in hydrocarbon feedstocks and products.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3abitumen 3afeedstocks 3afuels 3ainfrared spectroscopy 3alasers 3aliquids 3amodels 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aolefin1 aGieleciak, R.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5409-34981 aMichaelian, K.

Microcystins, produced primarily by strains of cyanobacteria belonging to the genera Microcystis, Anabaena and Planktothrix, are harmful cyanobacterial hepatotoxins. These bloom-forming cyanobacteria form toxic and non-toxic strains that co-occur and are visually indistinguishable, but can be identified and quantified molecularly. We described the relationships between microcystin production and the genotypic composition of the Microcystis community involved together with environmental conditions in both the Roodeplaat and Hartbeespoort reservoirs using quantitative real time PCR. DNA copy number of the Microcystis-specific 16S rRNA and toxin biosynthesis genes, mcyE and mcyB, were measured. Planktothrix spp. occurred in both reservoirs during autumn, but no toxin-producing species was present as measured with mcyE specific primers, whereas both toxic and non-toxic strains of Microcystis were recorded in both reservoirs, with Microcystis spp. dominating in the summer months. Water-surface temperature correlated strongly with microcystin concentration, mcyE and mcyB copy number. Microcystin production was associated by temperatures higher than 23°C. This suggests that should current environmental trends persist with surface water temperatures continuing to rise and more and more nutrients continued to be loaded into fresh water systems toxic Microcystis may outgrow non-toxic Microcystis and synthesise even more microcystins.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAnabaena 3aDNA 3aMicrocystis 3aPlanktothrix 3aautumn 3abiosynthesis 3aenvironmental factors 3afreshwater 3agenes 3ahepatotoxins 3amicrocystins 3anutrients 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3aribosomal RNA 3asummer 3asurface water temperature 3atoxicity1 aBarnard, Sandra0 tHarmful algae.g2012 Dec., v. 20 p.1-10dElsevier B.V.x1568-98837nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.hal.2012.03.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04223naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001900153245012000172300001600292520276900308592002803077650002403105650001903129650002003148650002503168650002303193650002603216650002203242650001203264650001503276650001303291650001103304650002103315651002803336653003203364653001803396653003003414653002403444653002703468653002203495653001003517653000803527700001803535773009203553856008703645852000903732655001203741IND60546803920221117230647.0170713e201511  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054680392DNAL7 a10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2015.10.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRammer, Werner10aCoupling human and natural systems: Simulating adaptive management agents in dynamically changing forest landscapes  ap. 475-485.  aGlobal change poses considerable challenges for ecosystems and their managers. To address these challenges it is increasingly clear that a coupled human and natural systems perspective is needed. While this science has advanced greatly in recent years, its mainstreaming into operational ecosystem management has proven to be difficult. One aspect complicating the application of a coupled human and natural systems approach has been the lack of tools that are simultaneously able to accommodate the complexities of ecological and social systems. However, neglecting their full interactions and feedbacks could lead to either an overestimation of the systems’ vulnerability to global change (e.g., where the social adaptive capacity is disregarded in assessments based solely on ecosystem models), or to the pretense of stability (e.g., where the dynamic responses of ecosystem processes to environmental changes are neglected in models of the social system). These issues are of particular importance in forest ecosystems, where human interventions affect ecosystem dynamics for decades to centuries. In order to improve the assessments of future forest trajectories, our objectives here were (i) to operationalize and describe the coupling of human and natural systems in the context of landscape-scale forest ecosystem management, and (ii) to demonstrate simulated interactions between the social and ecological spheres in the context of adaptation to a changing climate. We developed an agent-based model accounting for different spatial (stand and management unit) and temporal (operational and strategic) levels of forest management decision making and coupled it with the forest landscape simulator iLand. We show that the coupled human and natural systems model is autonomously able to reproduce meaningful trajectories of managed mountain forest landscape in Central Europe over the extended period of multiple centuries. Experimenting with different decision heuristics of managing agents suggests that both passive (reactive) and active (prospective) adaptive behavior might be necessary to successfully stabilize system trajectories under rapidly changing environmental conditions. Furthermore, investigating multi-agent landscapes we found that diversity in managerial responses to environmental changes increases the heterogeneity on the landscape, with positive effects on the temporal stability of ecosystem trajectories. We conclude that an integrated consideration of human and natural systems is important to realistically project trajectories of managed forests under global change, and highlight the potential of social–ecological feedbacks and heterogeneity in stabilizing the provisioning of ecosystem services in a changing environment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadaptive management 3aclimate change 3adecision making 3aecosystem management 3aecosystem services 3aenvironmental factors 3aforest ecosystems 3aforests 3alandscapes 3amanagers 3amodels 3astand management 3aCentral European region 0aForest ecosystem management 0aGlobal change 0aSocial-ecological systems 0aAdaptive management 0aForest landscape model 0aAgent-based model 0aiLand 0aABE1 aSeidl, Rupert0 tGlobal environmental change.g2015 Nov., v. 35 p.475-485dElsevier Ltdx0959-37807nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2015.10.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02823naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002500092040001800117100001400135245013100149300001600280520150000296592002801796650001501824650003001839650001601869650002001885650001501905650001501920650001501935650002501950650001501975650001901990651001002009653004102019653001902060653002102079653003302100653002502133653002702158700001402185700001602199700001502215773008802230856003802318852000902356655001202365IND4472611820221122050343.0120318s2012    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447261182DNAL7 a10.1071/RJ110552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHu, Z.

Remotely sensed normalised difference vegetation index and ANPP data, measured in situ, were integrated to allow the prediction of ANPP and PUE in each 1km2 of the 12 prefectures of Inner Mongolia. Furthermore, the temporal dynamics of PUE and ANPP residuals, as indicators of ecosystem deterioration and recovery, were investigated for the region and each prefecture. In general, both ANPP and PUE were positively correlated with mean annual precipitation, i.e. ANPP and PUE were higher in wet regions than in arid regions. Both PUE and ANPP residuals indicated that the state of the rangelands of the region were generally improving during the period of 2000–05, but declined by 2007 to that found in 1999. Among the four main grassland-dominated prefectures, the recovery in the state of the grasslands in the Erdos and Chifeng prefectures was highest, and Xilin Gol and Chifeng prefectures was 2 years earlier than Erdos and Hunlu Buir prefectures. The study demonstrated that the use of PUE or ANPP residuals has some limitations and it is proposed that both indices should be used together with relatively long-term datasets in order to maximise the reliability of the assessments.  aPublisher supplied data 3aarid zones 3aatmospheric precipitation 3acorrelation 3adata collection 3aecosystems 3agrasslands 3aprediction 3aprimary productivity 3arangelands 3aremote sensing 3aChina 0aaboveground net primary productivity 0aInner Mongolia 0aland degradation 0aprecipitation-use efficiency 0atemperate grasslands 0avegetation restoration1 aLi, S.

In this paper, an epoxy-based nanocomposite that has a high thermal conductivity and a low electrical conductivity, which are required for the use of a material as electronic packaging and insulation, was prepared. The performance of the epoxy was improved by incorporating a magnesium oxide-coated graphene (MgO@GR) nanomaterial into the epoxy matrix. We found that the addition of a MgO coating not only improved the dispersion of the graphene in the matrix and the interfacial bonding between the graphene and epoxy but also enhanced the thermal conductivity of the epoxy while preserving the electrical insulation. By adding 7 wt % MgO@GR, the thermal conductivity of the epoxy nanocomposites was enhanced by 76% compared with that of the neat epoxy, and the electrical resistivity was maintained at 8.66 × 10¹⁴ Ω m.  aPublisher supplied data 3acoatings 3aelectrical conductivity 3aelectrical resistance 3aepoxides 3agraphene 3aheat transfer 3ainsulating materials 3amagnesium oxide 3ananocomposites 3ananomaterials 3apackaging 3athermal conductivity 0aepoxy 0agraphene 0amagnesium oxide 0acomposites 0athermal conductivity1 aYang, Wen1 aZhang, Fang1 aTang, Chak-Yin1 aLiu, Sheng-peng1 aYin, Le1 aLaw, Wing-Cheung0 tACS applied materials .g2015 July 08, v. 7, no. 26 p.14397-14403dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.5b031963Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02027naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002400144242017900168245015600347300001600503520061100519592002801130650001901158650001501177650001701192650001001209650001701219650001301236650001701249653001501266653001601281653001801297653001301315653001101328653002301339653001801362700002601380773012401406856007801530852000901608655001201617IND60694548320221116185352.0200513e20140101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069454832DNAL7 a10.3896/IBRA.1.53.5.082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCarreck, Norman L.,10aLa dosis hace el veneno: ¿se han sobreestimado las tasas “realistas de campo” de exposición de las abejas a los insecticidas neonicotinoides en estudios de laboratorio?14aThe dose makes the poison: have “field realistic” rates of exposure of bees to neonicotinoid insecticides been overestimated in laboratory studies?  ap. 607-614.  aRecent laboratory based studies have demonstrated adverse sub-lethal effects of neonicotinoid insecticides on honey bees and bumble bees, and these studies have been influential in leading to a European Union moratorium on the use of three neonicotinoids, clothianidin, imidacloprid, and thiamethoxam on “bee attractive” crops. Yet so far, these same effects have not been observed in field studies. Here we review the three key dosage factors (concentration, duration and choice) relevant to field conditions, and conclude that these have probably been over estimated in many laboratory based studies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEuropean Union 3aapiculture 3aclothianidin 3ahoney 3aimidacloprid 3aresearch 3athiamethoxam 0ahoney bees 0abumble bees 0aconcentration 0aduration 0achoice 0alaboratory studies 0afield studies1 aRatnieks, Francis L W0 tJournal of apicultural research.g2014 Jan. 1, v. 53, no. 5 p.607-614dTaylor & FranciswJournal:12840x2078-69137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3896/IBRA.1.53.5.083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02971naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002200149245009300171520182400264592002802088650001902116650001302135650001402148650000902162650001702171650001202188650000902200650002002209650001302229650001102242653001902253653001802272653002602290653002402316653002802340700001702368773009502385856008402480852000902564655001202573IND60752753420221121220619.0220809e20220101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075275342DNAL7 a10.1016/j.appet.2021.1057212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aButtlar, Benjamin10aEscaping from the meat paradox: How morality and disgust affect meat-related ambivalence  aMeat production and its consumption harm animals, the environment, and human health; nevertheless, many people like to eat meat. If people become aware of this so-called meat paradox, they experience an aversive cognitive conflict. People, therefore, have to eschew meat if they permanently want to resolve this conflict. Eschewing meat is demanding, however, because people have to resist their temptation to eat meat and challenge social norms. In the present research, we thus conducted two pre-registered studies to investigate how people may overcome these obstacles: We hypothesized that people may go through a hedonic shift in which they establish cognitive consistency by forming univalent instead of ambivalent attitudes and that this process is fueled by the moral emotion disgust. In Study 1, we found that veg*ans who pursued moral goals with their diet reported more disgust towards meat, which was associated with reduced meat-related ambivalence. In Study 2, we found that disgust towards meat was again associated with decreased meat-related ambivalence. That is, veg*ans and omnivores similarly reported greater disgust after reading a text describing bad hygienic conditions in meat production. Besides this physical disgust, they also experienced heightened disgust if they read a text on animal cruelty in meat production. This moral disgust, however, was only elicited in people who did not morally disengage from their harmful behavior, i.e., in people who attributed relatively high emotional and mental capacities towards animals. While the latter findings of Study 2 are rather exploratory, taken together our findings suggest that morality and disgust may indeed promote cognitive consistency. The outlined processes thus could play a pivotal role in adopting and maintaining meat-less diets.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal welfare 3aappetite 3acognition 3adiet 3ahuman health 3ahygiene 3ameat 3ameat production 3amorality 3apeople 0aMoral emotions 0aHedonic shift 0aCognitive consistency 0aMoral disengagement 0aAttitudinal ambivalence1 aWalther, Eva0 tAppetite.g2022 Jan. 01, v. 168 p.105721-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl31756x0195-66637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.appet.2021.1057213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02322naa a2200373 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002400075024005000099040001800149100001700167245009200184300001600276500000900292520113700301592002801438650002001466650001001486650002001496650002101516650002501537650001101562650002201573650001401595650001701609650002001626650001701646700002501663700002001688773012201708852000901830856009701839655001201936991566013240742620221119193911.0191122e197411  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aCAIN7590132462DNAL7 a10.2134/agronj1974.00021962006600060007x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTeare, I.

We studied nitrate reductase activities in sorghum (Sorghum bicolor L. Moench cv. ‘Pioneer #846’) using in vivo assay and compared activities by leaf position on culms and various positions on leaves — through diurnal and seasonal trends (from stalk elongation to maturity, 1971). We related leaf water potential (measured with pressure bomb) and atmospheric demand for water (solar radiation measured with a pyranometer) with nitrate reductase activity. Nitrate reductase activity was highest in the upper, fullyexpanded leaves — in the flag leaf at the 5.5 stage of physiological development. We also compared relative amounts of hydrocyanic acid in sorghum, which other workers have observed in relation to physiological age, with seasonal nitrate reductase activities. Diurnal water stress (shown as leaf water potential hi relation to high solar radiation) lowered nitrate reductase activity. Nitrate reductase activity decreases as plant age and water stress increases and likely decreases as hydrocyanic acid increases.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSorghum bicolor 3aculms 3aenzyme activity 3ahydrogen cyanide 3aleaf water potential 3aleaves 3anitrate reductase 3aplant age 3apyranometers 3asolar radiation 3awater stress1 aManam, Radhamohanrao1 aKanemasu, E.

Reproductive and productive capacities of the colony, as two important physiological qualities can depend a great deal on the age of the queen. Over the years, the laying ratio of queens could decrease depending on the age; therefore colonies headed by one-year-old queens have proven to be more efficient considering colony population and honey production than ones with older queens. Nosema ceranae infection is a possible reason for the decrease in reproductive capacities and the reduction in the honey production of infected colonies. With the help of numerous pheromones, the queen can preserve colony homeostasis, however exhausted by N. ceranae infection she might compromise the renewal of worker population. The aim of this research is to investigate the influence of N. ceranae on reproduction and productivity of honey bee colonies headed by queens of different age. Experiment was conducted on 27 honey bee colonies equalized with regard to brood, food source, number of worker bees and Nosema infection. In the three year investigation period (2009–2012), Nosema detection, identification and spore load per each colony, as well as parameters of colony reproduction (such as uncapped and capped brood area, queen egg-laying rate and colony strength) and productivity (the total extracted honey and the winter honey stores) were recorded. Concerning the influence of the age of the queens on followed parameters we compared one, two and three-years old queens and found significantly higher reproductive and productive values in favour of younger ones. Significant differences regarding the effects of N. ceranae infection on productive and reproductive characteristics could be explained with a higher capacity of one year old queens to compensate the effects of Nosema infection; a capacity which gradually declines in the second and the third year.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNosema ceranae 3aapiculture 3ahomeostasis 3ahoney 3ahoney bee colonies 3aoviposition 3aresearch 3aspores 0aqueen age 0aN. ceranae 0abrood area 0aegg-laying rate 0acolony strength 0aextracted honey 0ahoney stores1 aStevanovic, Jevrosima1 aCirkovic, Dragan1 aRadojicic, Sonja1 aLakić, Nada,1 aStanisic, Ljubodrag1 aStanimirovic, Zoran0 tJournal of apicultural research.g2014 Jan. 1, v. 53, no. 5 p.545-554dTaylor & FranciswJournal:12840x2078-69137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3896/IBRA.1.53.5.093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04490naa a2200673 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002300151245018400174506011700358506007600475520247400551592002803025506003703053650001203090650001803102650001003120650001403130650001503144650001903159650000903178650001703187650000903204651000903213653002103222653002303243653002003266653001503286653004403301653000803345653002303353653001503376653001703391653000803408653000703416653000703423653000903430653000803439653001003447653000803457653000803465653001103473653000903484653000703493653000703500653000903507653000803516653000903524700002303533700002803556700002403584773010103608856008603709852000903795655001203804IND60766471520221207141610.0220606e202203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076647152DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecolind.2022.1086212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEskandari, Saeedeh10aProvision of eucalyptus wood farming potential map in Iran: An application of land cover, ecological, climatic, hydrologic, and edaphic analysis in a GIS-based fuzzy AHP framework  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aIran is a low-forest cover country (<10% of country area is forested) and has problems with deforestation and increasing demands for wood products. This wood scarcity has prompted the country to curtail industrial logging to meet other demands for wood. The costs of importing wood are rising, so farming wood industrially with fast-growing species may help with this problem. Eucalyptus is a fast-growing species that can be used for industrial production and has been proven adaptable to the environments of southern Iran. This study identifies the most suitable locations for eucalyptus wood-farming in Khuzestan Province. Twenty-two factors and fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (FAHP) were used to identify the best locations for eucalyptus wood-farming in this Province in southern Iran. The independent variables used reflect four components of the environment: soil, water, climate, and land cover. Maps of twenty-two factors were prepared from satellite data, ground sampling, and other geospatial data sources. Eucalyptus plantations in Khuzestan Province were mapped by combining GPS-located ground surveys with data from the Khuzestan Natural Resources Administration. The ecological needs of E. camaldulensis were determined from a review of eucalyptus adaptation studies conducted in southern Iran. The factor maps were classified based on their suitability for eucalyptus farming and these classes served as within-layer weights. The weights of effective factors were calculated using FAHP and Chang's fuzzy-extent analysis (outside-of-layer weights). The accuracies of the fuzzy weights of effective factors were assessed by consistency ratio. A eucalyptus wood-farming potential map was created by overlaying the weighted sub-factor maps. This map was validated with real data (the map of current eucalyptus plantations), overall accuracy assessment, and the kappa index. The results showed that among the primary factors, water (weight: 0.34) and land cover (weight: 0.32) were the most influential determinants of the best locations for eucalyptus farming. The accuracy assessment revealed that the FAHP method produced an overall accuracy of 82% and kappa index of 0.71. This is acceptably strong for the identification of the best eucalyptus farm locations in Khuzestan Province. The wood-farming potential map developed from this research, can be used as a foundation to plan eucalyptus farming in southern Iran to meet the demand for wood in Iran.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aclimate 3adeforestation 3afarms 3ahydrology 3aland cover 3aremote sensing 3asoil 3aspatial data 3awood 3aIran 0aClimatic factors 0aEcological factors 0aEdaphic factors 0aEucalyptus 0aFuzzy analytic hierarchy process (FAHP) 0aGIS 0aHydrologic factors 0aLand cover 0aWood-farming 0aBRT 0aCI 0aCR 0aFAHP 0aFAO 0aFRWOI 0aGLM 0aGPS 0aMaxEnt 0aMCDM 0aOA 0aRI 0aRIFR 0aSVM 0aSWRI1 aBehnamfar, Kourosh1 aPourghasemi, Hamid Reza1 aTiefenbacher, John,0 tEcological indicators.g2022 Mar., v. 136 p.108621-dElsevier LtdwJournal:6196x1470-160X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2022.1086213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03189naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100005600153245012500209300001800334520186400352592002802216650001502244650001502259650001602274650001302290650001002303650001202313650001802325650001102343650001602354650001702370650001302387650002102400650001102421650000702432650001102439650001902450650001802469700002102487700002002508773011902528856008702647852000902734655001202743IND60637503720221117195040.0190418e20190305xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063750372DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.energyfuels.8b039732doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAjdari, Sima1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5701-520110aEvaluation of Operating and Design Parameters of Pressurized Flue Gas Systems with Integrated Removal of NOₓ and SOₓ  ap. 3339-3348.  aThis study investigates the operating and design parameters of product gas compression and integrated control of nitrogen oxides (NOₓ) and sulfur oxides (SOₓ) in large-scale oxy-fuel and chemical looping combustion processes. A process model that includes a comprehensive description of nitrogen and sulfur chemistry and mass transfer is developed. The results show that the fraction of NO oxidation into NO₂ will be 10–50% in a multistage compressor to 30 bars (1–4% O₂ in the gas) depending on the residence times in intercoolers and pressure levels. At lower O₂ concentrations (>0.1% O₂ in the gas), the oxidation is limited but still active. Nitric acid formation in the compressor condensate is, thus, inevitable, although limited, as most water is condensed in the early stages, whereas the acid gases are formed in the later stages. The NO₂/NOₓ ratio has an important effect on the total amount of NOₓ absorbed and extra residence time should be added after the compressor to increase this ratio. Evaluation of the process behavior in relation to simultaneous absorption of SO₂ and NOₓ revealed that increased SO₂/NOₓ ratio and bottom liquid recycling enhanced the total NOₓ absorption. In addition, maintaining the pH in the absorbing solution above 5 improves the removal efficiencies of NOₓ and SO₂. NOₓ removal rates of up to around 95% can be achieved for SO₂/NOₓ > 1 in the flue gas with appropriate design of the absorber. For SO₂/NOₓ < 1, increasing the packing height or addition of S(IV) solutions could enhance the NOₓ removal rates to 95% or more. The model predictions are compared with the experimental data from a laboratory-scale absorber. The process model developed in this work enables design studies and techno-economic evaluation of absorption-based NOₓ and SOₓ removal concepts.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3acombustion 3acondensates 3aflue gas 3afuels 3aliquids 3amass transfer 3amodels 3anitric acid 3anitric oxide 3anitrogen 3anitrogen dioxide 3aoxygen 3apH 3asulfur 3asulfur dioxide 3asulfur oxides1 aNormann, Fredrik1 aAndersson, Klas0 tEnergy & fuels.g2019 Mar. 05, v. 33, no. 4 p.3339-3348dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23338x1520-50297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.energyfuels.8b039733Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03170naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100003400147245008600181300001600267520183000283592002802113650001502141650002402156650002202180650002302202650000902225650001402234650002302248650002102271650001702292650001402309650001802323650002002341650001602361650001602377651000902393651001102402651001802413700001702431700002402448700002202472700002602494773009002520856008102610852000902691655001202700IND60572867920221117055148.0170718e201706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057286792DNAL7 a10.1007/s10526-017-9805-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRaak-van den Berg, C.

We performed a meta-analysis of published life history data to address the question whether invading populations in Europe and North America have life history parameters that differ from native populations in Asia, explaining the beetle’s invasion success in new territories. In this meta-analysis, we accounted for important covariables that are often reported in published studies such as temperature, food source (aphids or eggs of Ephestia kuehniella), strain (laboratory or field populations) and photoperiod. Temperature was a key factor having consistent large effects on development rate, survival and reproductive characteristics of H. axyridis. Food source, strain, and photoperiod had effects on some, but not all characteristics, and their overall effect across characteristics was minor. Individuals of invasive populations had a shorter pre-oviposition period and higher fecundity at low temperatures than those of native populations, and a greater longevity across all temperatures. No differences in survival were found between native and invasive populations, while differences in development rate were not consistent, with opposing results obtained according to the way development rate was measured in trials reported in the literature. Results of this meta-analysis support the hypothesis that the life history of the beetle has changed during its invasion into North America and Europe. Invasive populations had a shorter pre-oviposition period and higher fecundity at low temperatures, as well as a greater longevity across all temperatures than native populations. These differences may partially explain the invasive success of H. axyridis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAphidoidea 3aEphestia kuehniella 3aHarmonia axyridis 3acolonizing ability 3aeggs 3afecundity 3aindigenous species 3ainvasive species 3alife history 3alongevity 3ameta-analysis 3anatural enemies 3aphotoperiod 3atemperature 3aAsia 3aEurope 3aNorth America1 aHemerik, Lia1 avan der Werf, Wopke1 ade Jong, Peter W.1 avan Lenteren, Joop C.0 tBioControl.g2017 June, v. 62, no. 3 p.283-296dSpringer Netherlandsx1386-61417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10526-017-9805-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02411naa a2200445 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002400075024005000099040001800149100001800167245007100185300001600256500000900272500001500281520109200296592002801388650001301416650002101429650001101450650001301461650002101474650001601495650001901511650001201530650002601542650001901568650001401587650001701601650001001618651003101628653001101659653001701670700002101687700001801708773012201726852000901848856009601857655001201953991565996470742620221119193518.0191122e197411  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aCAIN7590132602DNAL7 a10.2134/agronj1974.00021962006600060021x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBaldwin, Ford10aWeed Control Systems for Hophornbeam Copperleaf Control in Peanuts  ap. 789-792.  aepub  a2019-12-05  aHophornbeam copperleaf (Acalypha ostraefolia Ridd), an increasing weed problem in peanuts (Arachis hypogaea L.) in the southwestern United States, is resistant to most presently used herbicides. Research was conducted to design and evaluate production systems that would provide full season control of this weed in peanuts. Screening experiments indicated several herbicides would control copperleaf but that they were not selective for peanuts. Preliminary systems utilizing alachlor (2-chloro-2',6'-diethyl-N-(methoxymethyl)acetanilide) at 2.24 kg/ha combined with rotary cultivation provided early but not full season control. Ultimately systems involving a preplant herbicide, alachlor or fluorodifen (p-nitrophenyl α,α,α-trifluoro 2-nitro-p-totyl ether) either preemergence or with several postemergence combinations, and timely cultivations were developed that controlled copperleaf for the entire growing season. Fluorodifen combinations (at 5 kg/ha) applied postemergence to peanuts and copperleaf up to 7.5 cm tall provided excellent weed control with no visible crop injury.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcalypha 3aArachis hypogaea 3aOstrya 3aalachlor 3aapplication rate 3afluorodifen 3agrowing season 3apeanuts 3aproduction technology 3arotary tillage 3ascreening 3aweed control 3aweeds 3aSouthwestern United States 0aplants 0aweed science1 aSantelmann, Paul1 aGreer, Howard0 tAgronomy journal.g1974 Nov., v. 66, no. 6 p.789-792dAmerican Society of AgronomywJournal:jnl44592x0002-19627nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2134/agronj1974.00021962006600060021x3Available from publisher's site 7aarticle01196naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002000143245007200163300001600235520020600251592002800457650001500485650001700500650001300517650000700530653001800537653001900555653001700574653002900591700001400620773015000634856007700784852000900861655001200870IND60522372120221119073239.0160602e20140602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052237212DNAL7 a10.1515/znb-2010-03102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLanghals, Heinz10aFluorescent Nano pH Indicators Based on Supramolecular Interactions  ap. 291-294.  aLipophilic pH-sensitive perylene derivatives were combined with detergents in a supramolecular arrangement to obtain nanomicelles that can be applied as fluorescent pH indicators for the aqueous phase.  aPublisher supplied data 3adetergents 3afluorescence 3amicelles 3apH 0apH Indicators 0aNano Particles 0aFluorescence 0aSupramolecular Chemistry1 aPust, Tim0 tZeitschrift für Naturforschung.g2014 June 2, v. 65, no. 3 p.291-294dVerlag der Zeitschrift für NaturforschungwJournal:23182x0932-07767nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1515/znb-2010-03103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03393naa a2200625 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003800111040001800149100002900167245010800196300001600304520126000320592002801580650004801608650001801656650001501674650002301689650001101712650001301723650001201736650001101748650002101759650001101780650001601791650001301807650001201820650003301832650003501865650001101900650006901911650002301980650002802003650004202031650002902073650004102102650004802143650006002191650007002251650004502321650003602366700002302402700002102425700002002446700002102466700001902487700001402506700002202520773012002542856008402662852000902746655001202755IND4459976420221120122411.0141111e20110815xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445997642DNAL7 a216403882pmid7 a10.1016/j.vetimm.2011.05.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNguyễn, Thị Kim Anh,10aImmune response of cattle immunized with a conjugate of the glycolipid glucose monomycolate and protein  ap. 265-270.  aStrong anti glycolipid IgG responses can occur in humans and animals, but contrary to anti protein responses and anti glycoprotein responses, the exact mechanism of induction is unknown. We have previously shown that experimental immunization with the glycolipid glucose monomycolate (GMM) causes the development of specific T cell responses, but not of anti GMM antibodies. However, cattle naturally infected with Mycobacterium avium ssp. paratuberculosis produce high levels of anti GMM IgG. In the present study, we tested whether vaccination with GMM conjugated to a protein mimics natural infection in its capacity to induce the production of antibodies against GMM. Cattle were immunized (n=5 per group) with GMM conjugated to a protein, or GMM and protein non-conjugated and administered at contralateral locations, or carrier only. Although immunization with the GMM–protein conjugate vaccine and the non-conjugated vaccine induced protein specific antibody responses, GMM specific antibodies were not detected in either of the groups. In conclusion, the generation of isotype-switched anti lipid antibodies appears to require more than providing peptide epitopes for T helper cells to support glycolipid specific B cells in antibody production.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis 3aT-lymphocytes 3aantibodies 3aantibody formation 3acattle 3aepitopes 3aglucose 3ahumans 3aimmunoglobulin G 3alipids 3avaccination 3avaccines 2aAnimals 2aAntibodies, Bacterialxblood 2aBacterial Vaccinesximmunology 2aCattle 2aCattle Diseasesximmunologyxmicrobiologyxprevention & control. 2aCell Proliferation 2aGlycolipidsximmunology 2aHSP70 Heat-Shock Proteinsximmunology 2aHemocyaninsximmunology. 2aImmunizationxstandardsxveterinary. 2aImmunoconjugatesximmunologyxpharmacology. 2aMycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosisximmunology 2aParatuberculosisximmunologyxmicrobiologyxprevention & control. 2aT-Lymphocytesximmunologyxmicrobiology. 2aVaccines, Conjugateximmunology1 aWieland, Willemien1 aSantema, Wiebren1 aHoeboer, Jeroen1 avan Eden, Willem1 aRutten, Victor1 aKoets, Ad1 aVan Rhijn, Ildiko0 tVeterinary immunology and immunopathology.g2011 Aug. 15, v. 142, no. 3-4 p.265-270dElsevier B.V.x0165-24277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetimm.2011.05.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03098naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245014500170300001600315520133600331592002801667650003401695650002301729650004401752650002501796650001801821650001801839650001201857650001001869650002601879650004301905650001301948650001201961650002201973650001301995650001302008650001702021650001202038650001202050650001402062650001302076650001002089650002902099650002002128650001302148650001902161650001102180653002002191653000902211653000902220653000902229653001602238700001902254700001602273773010002289856008602389852000902475655001202484IND60618079620221118101924.0190130e201901  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061807962DNAL7 a10.1016/j.procbio.2018.10.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPrabhjot Kaur,10aBio-utilization of fruits and vegetables waste to produce β-carotene in solid-state fermentation: Characterization and antioxidant activity  ap. 155-164.  aFruits and vegetable processing industries produce huge waste in the form of peels, seeds, liquid, and molasses which are a good source of carbohydrates, proteins, fibres, vitamins, and minerals. This waste can be utilized for the production of biocolors using fermentation. Utilization of this waste not only valorizes waste disposal problems but also eliminate environmental pollution. The aim of the present work was to extract and optimize environmental factors for production of β-carotene from fruits and vegetable waste (orange, carrot, and papaya peels) using microbial strain Blakeslea trispora (+) MTCC 884 in solid state fermentation. It was observed that the production of β-carotene was significantly influenced by varying all factors and gave a maximum yield of 0.127 mg/mL. Characterization of the extracted color was done with techniques like HPLC, LCMS, FTIR and Mass Spectroscopy. Mass spectroscopy of extracted color represented the m/z value 537.608 and LCMS analysis gave the eluted peaks at (Rt 13.37), which confirmed the presence of β-carotene. Furthermore, β-carotene percentage estimated by HPLC and LCMS was over 76% suggesting that these fruits and vegetable wastes may be used for the production of β-carotene with high purity and gave good antioxidant properties as determined by DPPH and ABTS.  aPublisher supplied data 3a2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl 3aBlakeslea trispora 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aantioxidant activity 3abeta-carotene 3acarbohydrates 3acarrots 3acolor 3aenvironmental factors 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3aindustry 3aliquids 3amass spectrometry 3aminerals 3amolasses 3aorange peels 3aoranges 3apapayas 3apollution 3aproteins 3aseeds 3asolid state fermentation 3avegetable peels 3avitamins 3awaste disposal 3awastes 0aFermented color 0aHPLC 0aLCMS 0aFTIR 0aAntioxidant1 aGhoshal, Gargi1 aJain, Ashay0 tProcess biochemistry.g2019 Jan., v. 76 p.155-164dElsevier LtdwJournal:12511x1359-51137nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.procbio.2018.10.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02679naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094024002200122024001900144040001800163100002200181245010500203506007600308520137500384592002801759506003701787650002701824650001901851650000901870650001001879650002001889650001101909650002601920650001401946651003301960700001801993700001802011700001902029700001902048773011902067856007402186852000902260655001202269IND60647291020221207133739.0190618e20190207xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064729102DNAL7 a10.3390/ani90200502doi7 aPMC64066812pmcid7 a307364152pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPockett, Jessica 10aInvestigating the Impact of Indemnity Waivers on the Length of Stay of Cats at an Australian Shelter  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aDue to resource limitations, animal shelters in Australia historically have focused on rehoming animals considered &lsquo;highly adoptable&rsquo;. Increasingly, animal shelters in Australia are rehoming animals with pre-existing medical and/or behavioural issues. These animals are often rehomed with an &lsquo;indemnity waiver&rsquo; to transfer the responsibility of ongoing financial costs associated with these conditions from the shelter to the new owner. However, it is unknown what effect these indemnity waivers have on the length of stay (LOS) of animals prior to adoption. The current study used data collected from the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (RSPCA) Weston shelter located in the Australian Capital Territory (ACT), Australia in 2017 to investigate the effect of indemnity waivers on the LOS of cats. A restricted maximum likelihood model (REML) was used to determine the effect of breed, age, coat colour, presence of a waiver, waiver type (categorised into seven groups) and waiver number (no waiver, single waiver or multiple waivers) on LOS. In the final multivariate model, age, breed and waiver number were found to influence LOS. Young cats, purebred cats and cats adopted without a waiver were adopted fastest. This study is the first to report the effect of indemnity waivers on the adoptability of cats from shelters.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aanimal rescue shelters 3aanimal welfare 3acats 3acolor 3adata collection 3amodels 3amultivariate analysis 3apurebreds 3aAustralian Capital Territory1 aOrr, Bronwyn 1 aHall, Evelyn 1 aChong, Wye  Li1 aWestman, Mark 0 tAnimals.g2019 Feb. 07, v. 9, no. 2dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2274x2076-26157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ani90200503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03051naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245010300166300001600269520157100285592002801856650002401884650002401908650002301932650001301955650001401968650001001982650001501992650001902007650002202026650001402048650000902062650001202071650001502083650001402098650001602112650001402128650001802142650001602160651001002176653000902186653000902195653001202204653003602216653002402252653001302276700001602289700001602305700001502321773010102336856005102437852000902488655001202497IND50075547320221118213125.0140410e20111201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007554732DNAL7 a10.1080/02757540.2011.6259412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBianchi, N.10aEcotoxicological study on lead shot from hunting in the Padule di Fucecchio marsh (Tuscany, Italy)  ap. 153-166.  aIngestion of lead shot has been recognised as an important cause of death in waterbirds for over a century. Chemical dissolution (oxidation) of lead shot in aquatic environments can make lead more available, distributing it throughout the aquatic ecosystem. The extent of the phenomenon has rarely been investigated in Italy and no systematic information is available for Italian wetlands. We investigated lead shot density and lead concentrations in sediment of the Padule di Fucecchio (Tuscany), one of the largest inland marshes in Italy (2000 ha), in order to evaluate the impact of lead shot from hunting. Moreover, to assess lead accumulation in organisms, red swamp crayfish, Procambarus clarkii (Girard 1852), was chosen as a bioindicator. The results showed a high lead shot density (0–311 shot · m⁻²). Although lead concentrations and lead shot density were slightly less in protected areas than in hunting areas, contamination was widespread throughout the marsh, with a mean lead concentration of 115.6 mg · kg⁻¹ d.w.. Crayfish were subject to heavy uptake of lead, with high concentrations in gut contents (43.84±47.48 mg · kg⁻¹ d.w.) and hepatopancreas (3.217±4.850 mg · kg⁻¹ d.w.). A detailed map of lead contamination was plotted using sediment data. Thematic mapping is a valuable support for environmental remediation and reserve management and assessment of lead contamination concomitant with the banning of lead shot in the area provides a useful database for long-term monitoring of the effectiveness of the ban.  aPublisher supplied data 3aProcambarus clarkii 3aaquatic environment 3aconservation areas 3acrayfish 3adatabases 3adeath 3aecosystems 3ahepatopancreas 3aindicator species 3aingestion 3alead 3amarshes 3amonitoring 3aoxidation 3aremediation 3asediments 3athematic maps 3awater birds 3aItaly 0alead 0ashot 0ahunting 0ageographical information system 0aPadule di Fucecchio 0acrayfish1 aFortino, S.1 aLeonzio, C.1 aAncora, S.0 tChemistry in ecology.g2011 Dec. 1, v. 27, no. sup2 p.153-166dTaylor & Francisx1029-03707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02757540.2011.625941  aDNAL 7aarticle02459naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001500151245008500166300001400251520105100265592002801316650001201344650001101356650001901367650002201386650001201408650001901420650002901439650001201468650002401480650001101504650002601515651001001541651001201551651001101563651001801574653001701592653003201609653001901641653003201660653001901692700001701711700001801728700001301746773011101759856008601870852000901956655001201965IND60581845220221119201109.0200614e20180101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058184522DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2017.08.2442doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Yan10aCO2 metabolic flow analysis in global trade based on ecological network analysis  ap. 34-41.  aCO₂ emission induced by international trade brings a plenty of pressure on global warming. Hence, it is important to understand multi-regional CO₂ flows that result from global trade and flow variation of different paths. After transforming capital flows into CO₂ carbon flows, we built an ecological network model of the global trade system's carbon metabolism. Through ecological network analysis, we identified the direct and indirect effects of temporal CO₂ flows in the network. We found that the total integral flow through the network experienced a remarkable increase during the study period. In addition, total import and export flows of four countries, including US, China, Germany and Russia, turned out to be rather big. Direct flow share was usually beyond 50% between two geographical adjacent countries, while that share was below 50% when two countries are far away. This research reveals the importance role of indirect flows and can therefore provide an empirical basis for adjusting and optimizing global trade network.  aPublisher supplied data 3acapital 3acarbon 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbon metabolism 3aexports 3aglobal warming 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3aimports 3ainternational trade 3amodels 3atrophic relationships 3aChina 3aGermany 3aRussia 3aUnited States 0aGlobal trade 0aEcological network analysis 0aMetabolic flow 0aDirect and indirect effects 0aImportant path1 aLi, Yaoguang1 aLiu, Gengyuan1 aHao, Yan0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2018 Jan. 01, v. 170 p.34-41dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2017.08.2443Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03713naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002900139245017800168300001800346500002000364520156500384592002801949596009201977596010402069596005302173596009902226596006402325650002702389650002402416650001302440650001202453650002202465650001202487650001302499650001402512650003102526650001402557651001602571700006002587700006302647700005902710700002802769700001802797700002402815700002602839700002602865700002602891700001902917773012702936856007403063961001303137852000903150655001203159IND60753470320221116152631.0211015e202111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075347032DNAL7 a10.1111/jfd.134912doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLópez‐Porras, Adrián10aGenetic variability of Edwardsiella piscicida isolates from Mississippi catfish aquaculture with an assessment of virulence in channel and channel × blue hybrid catfish  ap. 1725-1751.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe bacterium Edwardsiella piscicida causes significant losses in global aquaculture, particularly channel (Ictalurus punctatus) × blue (I. furcatus) hybrid catfish cultured in the south‐eastern United States. Emergence of E. piscicida in hybrid catfish is worrisome given current industry trends towards increased hybrid production. The project objectives were to assess intraspecific genetic variability of E. piscicida isolates recovered from diseased channel and hybrid catfish in Mississippi; and determine virulence associations among genetic variants. Repetitive extragenic palindromic sequence‐based PCR (rep‐PCR) using ERIC I and II primers was used to screen 158 E. piscicida diagnostic case isolates. A subsample of 39 E. piscicida isolates, representing predominant rep‐PCR profiles, was further characterized using BOX and (GTG)₅ rep‐PCR primers, virulence gene assessment and multilocus sequence analysis (MLSA) targeting housekeeping genes gyrb, pgi and phoU. The MLSA provided greater resolution than rep‐PCR, revealing 5 discrete phylogroups that correlated similarly with virulence gene profiles. Virulence assessments using E. piscicida representatives from each MLSA group resulted in 14‐day cumulative mortality ranging from 22% to 54% and 63 to 72% in channel and hybrid fingerlings, respectively. Across all phylogroups, mortality was higher in hybrid catfish (p < .05), supporting previous work indicating E. piscicida is an emerging threat to hybrid catfish aquaculture in the south‐eastern United States.  aPublisher supplied data  a58‐6402‐2729cUnited States Department of Agriculture Agricultural Research Service  a6402‐31320‐002‐02cUnited States Department of Agriculture Catfish Health Research Initiative  cUSDA‐NIFA Southern Regional Aquaculture Center  cMississippi Agricultural and Forestry Experiment Station (MAFES) Strategic Research Initiative  cMississippi State University College of Veterinary Medicine 3aEdwardsiella piscicida 3aIctalurus punctatus 3abacteria 3acatfish 3agenetic variation 3ahybrids 3aindustry 3amortality 3amultilocus sequence typing 3avirulence 3aMississippi1 aGriffin, Matt J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7920-34461 aArmwood, Abigail R.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5695-68751 aCamus, Alvin C.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6783-15091 aWaldbieser, Geoffrey C.1 aWare, Cynthia1 aRichardson, Bradley1 aGreenway, Terrence E.1 aRosser, Thomas Graham1 aAarattuthodiyil, Suja1 aWise, David J.0 tJournal of fish diseases.g2021 Nov., v. 44, no. 11 p.1725-1751dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl10108x0140-77757nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jfd.134913Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle02574naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001800149245008500167300001600252520153300268592002801801650001701829650001301846650002201859650001301881650001601894650001201910700003201922700002301954700002301977700001802000773012602018856008302144852000902227655001202236IND60087970320221120052247.0141102e20110401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008797032DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jembe.2011.01.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHagihara, Rie10aMinimizing errors in the analysis of dive recordings from shallow-diving animals  ap. 173-181.  aKnowledge of the diving behaviour of aquatic animals expanded considerably with the invention of time–depth recorders (TDRs) in the 1960s. The large volume of data acquired from TDRs can be analyzed using dive analysis software, however, the application of the software has received relatively little attention. We present an empirical procedure to select optimum values that are critical to obtaining reliable results: the zero-offset correction (ZOC) and the dive threshold. We used dive data from shallow-diving coastal dugongs (Dugong dugon) and visual observations from an independent study to develop and test a procedure that minimizes errors in characterizing dives. We initially corrected the surface level using custom software. We then determined the optimum values for each parameter by classifying dives identified by an open-source dive analysis software into Plausible and Implausible dives based on the duration of dives. The Plausible dives were further classified as Unrecognized dives if they were not identified by the software but were of realistic dive duration. The comparison of these dive types indicated that a ZOC of 1m and a dive threshold of 0.75m were the optimum values for our dugong data as they gave the largest number of Plausible dives and smaller numbers of other dive types. Frequency distributions of dive durations from TDRs and independent visual observations supported the selection. Our procedure could be applied to other shallow-diving animals such as coastal dolphins and turtles.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDugong dugon 3aaccuracy 3acomputer software 3adolphins 3areliability 3aturtles1 aJones, R.

However, empirical investigations are scant and the joint influence of human&ndash;dog interaction and physical activity remains unexplored. The aims of the current study were to (a) examine the canine endogenous oxytocin response to owner-led dog-walking and affiliative human&ndash;dog interactions and (b) investigate the moderating effect of the owner-reported strength of the human&ndash;dog bond on such responses. Twenty-six dogs took part in a random order cross-over trial, involving dog-walking and human&ndash;dog interactions. Urinary samples were collected before and after each condition. The data were analyzed using linear mixed models with condition, order of conditions, condition duration, and latency from initiation of condition to urine sample collection considered as fixed effects, and the participant was considered a random effect. Canine urinary oxytocin concentrations did not differ significantly following dog-walking (mean change: &minus;14.66 pg/mg Cr; 95% CI: &minus;47.22, 17.90) or affiliative human&ndash;dog interactions (mean change: 6.94 pg/mg Cr; 95% CI: &minus;26.99, 40.87). The reported strength of the human&ndash;dog bond did not significantly moderate the canine oxytocin response to either experimental condition. Contrary to our hypothesis, we did not observe evidence for a positive oxytocin response to dog-walking or human&ndash;dog interactions.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3across-over studies 3adata analysis 3adogs 3amodels 3aoxytocin 3aphysical activity 3aurine1 aEdwards, Kate  M.1 aBauman, Adrian 1 aGuastella, Adam  J.1 aDrayton, Bradley 1 aStamatakis, Emmanuel 1 aMcGreevy, Paul 0 tAnimals.g2019 Feb. 08, v. 9, no. 2dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2274x2076-26157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ani90200513Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03097naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100005900145245011200204300002000316520167500336592002802011650002002039650002102059650002502080650002602105650002402131650001302155650001302168650001202181653002402193653002102217700005702238700006302295700006202358700006102420773014202481856007902623852000902702655001202711IND60746406620221122233246.0210803e20210721xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074640662DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.est.1c032372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSaha, Provat K.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4044-935010aHigh-Spatial-Resolution Estimates of Ultrafine Particle Concentrations across the Continental United States  ap. 10320-10331.  aThere is growing evidence that ultrafine particles (UFP; particles smaller than 100 nm) are likely more toxic than larger particles. However, the health effects of UFP remain uncertain due in part to the lack of large-scale population-based exposure assessment. We develop a national-scale empirical model of particle number concentration (PNC; a measure of UFP) using data from mobile monitoring and fixed sites across the United States and a land-use regression (LUR) modeling framework. Traffic, commercial land use, and urbanicity-related variables explain much of the spatial variability of PNC (base model R² = 0.77, RMSE = 2400 cm–³). Model predictions are robust across a diverse set of evaluations [random 10-fold holdout cross-validation (HCV): R² = 0.72, RMSE = 2700 cm–³; spatially defined HCV: R² = 0.66, RMSE = 3000 cm–³; evaluation against an independent data set: R² = 0.54, RMSE = 2600 cm–³]. We apply our model to predict PNC at ∼6 million residential census blocks in the contiguous United States. Our estimates are annual average concentrations for 2016–2017. The predicted national census-block-level mean PNC ranges between 1800 and 26 600 cm–³ (population-weighted average: 6500 cm–³), with hotspots in cities and near highways. Our national PNC model predicts large urban–rural, intra-, and inter-city contrasts. PNC and PM₂.₅ are moderately correlated at the city scale, but uncorrelated at the regional/national scale. Our high-spatial-resolution national PNC estimates are useful for analyzing population exposure (socioeconomic disparity, epidemiological health impact) and environmental policy and regulation.  aPublisher supplied data 3adata collection 3aempirical models 3aenvironmental policy 3aenvironmental science 3aexposure assessment 3aland use 3atoxicity 3atraffic 0aultrafine particles 0aspatial modeling1 aHankey, Steve1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7530-60771 aMarshall, Julian D.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4087-12091 aRobinson, Allen L.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1819-083X1 aPresto, Albert A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9156-10940 tEnvironmental science & technology.g2021 July 21, v. 55, no. 15 p.10320-10331dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23339x1520-58517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.1c032373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01885naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245011800163300001800281520081000299592002801109650001601137650002301153650001301176650002101189650002201210650001301232653002401245653002301269653001401292700001501306700002001321773010401341856008101445852000901526655001201535IND60615576620221122053841.0181011e20181018xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061557662DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tet.2018.09.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSato, Ryota10aInvestigation for the cyclization efficiency of linear tetrapeptides: Synthesis of tentoxin B and dihydrotentoxin  ap. 6173-6181.  aInvestigation of the cyclization efficiency of N-methyl linear tetrapeptides using a molecular modeling study and chemical synthesis is described. The linear peptide with two N-methyl groups, MeAla-Leu-MePhe-Gly, forms γ-turn like conformation with the amine at N-terminus and the carbonyl at C-terminus in closer proximity to give the desired cyclic tetrapeptide, dihydrotentoxin. In addition, synthesis of tentoxin B by the combination of Fmoc solid-phase peptide synthesis and cyclization in solution phase has been reported. An unusual amino acid, an L-N-methyl-β-hydroxyphenylalanine derivative, which was assembled on solid support, was prepared from ethyl cinnamate. Cyclic tetrapeptide formation and cleavage of benzyl ether were optimized with DIPCI/HOBt/DIPEA and Et3SiH/Pd(OH)2, respectively.  aPublisher supplied data 3aamino acids 3achemical reactions 3amoieties 3amolecular models 3aorganic compounds 3apeptides 0aCyclic tetrapeptide 0aUnusual amino acid 0aFmoc-SPPS1 aOyama, Kie1 aKonno, Hiroyuki0 tTetrahedron.g2018 Oct. 18, v. 74, no. 42 p.6173-6181dElsevier LtdwJournal:11744x0040-40207nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tet.2018.09.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02114naa a2200289 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131100001600149245009200165300001600257520119600273592002801469650001701497650001401514650001101528650002501539650001201564651001901576700002401595773009901619856008501718852000901803655001201812IND4459059920221117220225.0141110e20110711xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445905992DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhydrol.2011.04.0242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee, Taesam10aIdentification of model order and number of neighbors for k-nearest neighbor resampling  ap. 136-145.  aAmong the various stochastic models used in hydrology and meteorology, the k-nearest neighbor resampling (KNNR) has been one of the most common alternatives to supplement the short historical records. In the KNNR model one needs to select the model order (d) and the number of nearest neighbors (k). Traditionally, the prescriptive selection (k=n¹/² where n is the record length) has been used for k and no practical solutions were provided to choose d. Another applicable approach is generalized cross-validation (GCV). However, it has been reported in the literature that GCV is not practical for the selection of d and k in the KNNR model. In the current study we propose an approach to select d and k based on the Akaike information criterion (AIC). The proposed approach was validated on a number of simulated datasets and applied to the case study of the Colorado River system. The results indicate that the proposed AIC-based approach represents a robust model for the selection of d and k. In the simulation study, the model led particularly to the selection of the same model orders as the real orders of the simulated datasets. It also gave acceptable k values in the case study.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase studies 3ahydrology 3amodels 3astochastic processes 3aweather 3aColorado River1 aOuarda, Taha B.M.J.0 tJournal of hydrology.g2011 July 11, v. 404, no. 3-4 p.136-145dElsevier B.V.x0022-16947nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2011.04.0243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03246naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245016600172300001600338520163600354592002801990650002302018650002202041650001602063650001502079650001602094650001602110650001802126650001302144650002402157650001002181650001302191650001302204650001802217650001902235650001802254650001502272650003702287650001502324650001502339653002202354653001502376653002802391653004802419653001902467700001802486700002502504773009302529856008502622852000902707655001202716IND60693710320221120195256.0211009s2020    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069371032DNAL7 a10.1016/j.toxrep.2019.12.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEl-Baz, Farouk K.14aThe ameliorating effect of carotenoid rich fraction extracted from Dunaliella salina microalga against inflammation- associated cardiac dysfunction in obese rats  ap. 118-124.  aThe carotenoid rich fraction of microalgae Dunaliella salina (crf-DS) have been receiving great attention, due to they abilities to protect and improve various disorders. The objective of this study is to explore the therapeutic efficiency of crf-DS on obesity-assciated cardiac dysfunction in the high-fat diet (HFD) treated rats. These rats were orally administered with crf-DS (150 mg /kg body weight), for six consecutive weeks in comparison with reference drug(orlistat). Specific cardiac biomarkers were examined including; adiponectin, plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI-1), glucagon, troponin-I (cTnI). The cell adhesion molecules (VCAM and ICAM), C-reactive protein (CRP), collagen type II (Col II), collagen alpha-1 (III) chain (Col3A1), lipoxygenase activity (LOX), as well as histopathological examination of cardiac tissue were investigated. Results indicated a significant reduction(P ≤ 0.05) in adiponectin and glucagon levels in serum of obese rats. However, cTnI, PAI-1, cell adhesion molecules, CRP, Col II, and Col3A1 and LOX levels declared marked increase. Histopathological examination of cardiac tissue showed fibrosis with severe congestion in the myocardial blood vessels. On the other hand, rats medicated with a crf-DS demonstrated noticeable ameliorating effect in all the measured parameters. Beside, myocardial tissue of obese rats showed no alteration. Hence, It could be concluded that, oral supplementation with crf-DS is able to attenuate cardiac dysfunction in obese rats. Further extended work is needed to exploit, the possible application of D. salina as nutraceuticals and food additives.  aPublisher supplied data 3aC-reactive protein 3aDunaliella salina 3aadiponectin 3abiomarkers 3ablood serum 3acarotenoids 3acell adhesion 3acollagen 3adietary supplements 3adrugs 3afibrosis 3aglucagon 3ahigh fat diet 3ahistopathology 3alipoxygenases 3amicroalgae 3aplasminogen activator inhibitors 3atoxicology 3atroponin I 0aDunaliella salina 0aAdipokines 0aCell adhesion molecules 0aCardiac dysfunction associated inflammation 0aHistopathology1 aAly, Hanan F.1 aAbd-Alla, Howaida I.0 tToxicology reports.g2020, v. 7 p.118-124dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23254x2214-75007nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.toxrep.2019.12.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03508naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094024002200122024001900144040001800163100001900181245010100200506007600301520184300377592002802220506003702248650001402285650002502299650001402324650001902338650002702357650003102384650002402415650001002439650002002449650001502469650001802484650001502502650001102517650003402528650001302562650001402575650002402589700001802613700001702631700001802648700001902666700001602685700002002701700001502721700001602736773011902752856007402871852000902945655001202954IND60647291520221207132817.0190618e20190212xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064729152DNAL7 a10.3390/ani90200542doi7 aPMC64062742pmcid7 a307597732pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXin, Xiaoping 10aKISS1 Suppresses Apoptosis and Stimulates the Synthesis of E2 in Porcine Ovarian Granulosa Cells  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aPrevious studies have strongly recommended that KISS-1 metastasis suppressor (KISS1) plays an essential gatekeeper of the initiation of reproductive maturation in mammals. However, KISS1 has been recently reported to highly express in ovarian granulosa cells (GCs). But the biological functionalities of KISS1 on cell apoptosis, cell cycle, and synthesis of estradiol-17&beta; (E2) have not been explored in GCs. In this study, using porcine GCs as a cellular model, the overexpression plasmid of KISS1 was built to explore the biological effects of KISS1 on the PI3K signaling pathway, estrogen signaling pathway, cell apoptosis, cell cycle, and E2 secretion. We found that mRNA of KISS1 highly expressed in the ovary and significantly increased from immature to mature follicles in gilts. Overexpression of KISS1 could significantly increase the mRNA expression of PIK3CG, PIK3C1, and PDK1, and significantly decreased the mRNA levels of FOXO3, TSC2, and BAD of PI3K signaling pathway. Furthermore, results of the flow cytometry showed that overexpression of KISS1 significantly inhibited the apoptosis of GCs and decreased the percentage of GCs at G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle. Additionally, overexpression of KISS1 could increase the mRNA levels of Star, CYP17, 3B-HSD, 17B-HSD of estrogen synthesis signaling pathway, significantly increase the concentration of E2 in the supernatant of the cultured GCs, and up-regulate the mRNA expression levels of ESR1 and ESR2. These results suggested that KISS1 might suppress cell apoptosis through activating the PI3K signaling pathway and stimulate synthesis of E2 via boosting the estrogen synthesis signaling pathway. This study would be of great interests for exploring the biological functionalities of KISS1 in the folliculogenesis and sex steroid production of the ovaries in mammals.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aapoptosis 3abioactive properties 3aestrogens 3aflow cytometry 3afollicular development 3agene expression regulation 3agene overexpression 3agilts 3agranulosa cells 3ainterphase 3amessenger RNA 3ametastasis 3amodels 3aphosphatidylinositol 3-kinase 3aplasmids 3asecretion 3asignal transduction1 aLi, Zhonghui 1 aZhong, Yuyi 1 aLi, Qingqing 1 aWang, Jiaying 1 aZhang, Hao 1 aYuan, Xiaolong 1 aLi, Jiaqi 1 aZhang, Zhe 0 tAnimals.g2019 Feb. 12, v. 9, no. 2dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2274x2076-26157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ani90200543Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03130naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002600113040001800139100002300157245013500180300001800315520146100333592002801794650002301822650002201845650001301867650001101880650001101891650000901902650001401911650001201925650004001937650004201977650001202019650002402031650003702055650004302092650002702135650005702162650001102219650002402230650002502254650000902279650000902288650001702297650005302314700002702367700002902394773009602423856007202519852000902591655001202600IND60082494620221121072259.0141025e201411  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008249462DNAL7 a248952202pmid7 a10.1002/ptr.51792doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAbbaszadeh, Hassan10aAntiangiogenic Activity of Xanthomicrol and Calycopterin, Two Polymethoxylated Hydroxyflavones in Both In Vitro and Ex Vivo Models  ap. 1661-1670.  aOur previous studies had shown xanthomicrol and calycopterin, two plant‐derived flavonoids, to have selective antiproliferative activity against some malignant cell lines. The present study is focused on the investigation of antiangiogenic potential of these two flavonoids, using in vitro and ex vivo models. Xanthomicrol and calycopterin were found to have potent inhibitory effects on microvessel outgrowth in the rat aortic ring assay. Xanthomicrol was able to completely block microvessel sprouting at 10 µg/mL, and calycopterin suppressed microvessel outgrowth by 89% at 5 µg/mL. Suramin and thalidomide, used at 20 µg/mL as positive controls, inhibited microvessel formation by 23% and 64%, respectively. The flavones also inhibited endothelial cell tube formation and human umbilical vein endothelial cell proliferation at 0.5, 5, and 10 µg/mL. In order to delineate the underlying mechanisms of antiangiogenic activity of these flavones, we investigated the influences of xanthomicrol and calycopterin on expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and basic‐fibroblast growth factor (b‐FGF) in endothelial cells. These flavones were able to inhibit VEGF expression at 0.5, 5, and 10 µg/mL, but they had little or no effect on b‐FGF expression. These findings suggest that xanthomicrol and calycopterin possess potent antiangiogenic activities, which may be due to their inhibitory influences on VEGF expression.  aPublisher supplied data 3acell proliferation 3aendothelial cells 3aflavones 3ahumans 3amodels 3arats 3asprouting 3asuramin 3avascular endothelial growth factors 2aAngiogenesis Inhibitorsxpharmacology 2aAnimals 2aAortaxdrug effects 2aCell Proliferationxdrug effects 2aFibroblast Growth Factor 2xmetabolism 2aFlavonesxpharmacology 2aHuman Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cellsxdrug effects 2aHumans 2aIn Vitro Techniques 2aLamiaceaexchemistry 2aMale 2aRats 2aRats, Wistar 2aVascular Endothelial Growth Factor Axmetabolism1 aEbrahimi, Soltan Ahmad1 aAkhavan, Maziar Mohammad0 tPhytotherapy research.g2014 Nov., v. 28, no. 11 p.1661-1670dHeyden & Sonx0951-418X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ptr.51793Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03610naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245011900170300001600289500001500305520192600320592002802246650001602274650001802290650001902308650003102327650001102358650001102369650001102380650001502391650001902406650001102425650001302436650001902449650002802468650001902496650001002515650001102525653003502536653003102571653001102602653002102613653001102634653001002645653001002655700002102665700002202686700001902708700002502727700002302752700002202775700001902797773010902816856008602925852000903011655001203020IND60570664620221117205748.0190319e20171118xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057066462DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scienta.2017.06.0612doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPaul, Sreyashi10aEffect of high temperature on yield associated parameters and vascular bundle development in five potato cultivars  ap. 134-140.  a2019-12-06  aHigh temperature is one of the major abiotic stresses affecting performance of crop plants including potato yield. To gain an insight into whether high temperature effects tuber yield and its relation to translocation of photoassimilates in potato, a comparative study was conducted using five (Kufri jyoti, Kufri megha, Kufri pokraj, Rangpuria, and Badami) potato cultivars for two consecutive years. These cultivars were sown early in the season (mid August–November) when the temperature was high and normal growing season (ambient condition) (mid October–mid January) in an open field along in a polyhouse where the temperature was high. Early season planting experienced highest temperature (30–35°C) and temperature in the polyhouse was 2–4°C higher than the ambient condition. Leaf net CO2 assimilation rate, stem anatomy, xylem size, sugar-starch ratio, activity of sucrose phosphate synthase, tuber bulking rate and tuber yield were evaluated under all three conditions (early season, ambient condition and polyhouse conditions). Overall, compared to ambient conditions, under early season and polyhouse conditions, the net photosynthesis rate was significantly reduced but sugar starch ratio was significantly enhanced in all tested cultivars. Under both early planting and polyhouse conditions, the xylem cells were abnormally enlarged and deformed in all potato cultivars, however, the effects were minimal in case of cultivar Kufri megha (high yielding cultivar) and Rangpuria (local cultivar) which was correlated with the minimal yield reduction. Overall, the temperature induced abnormalities in vascular tissues appears to be critical for tuber bulking rate and tuber yield (42–55% in the high yielding cultivars and 44–54% in the local cultivars). The cultivars that could maintain xylem size and phloem structure tended to minimize the negative effects of high temperature on tuber yield.  aPublisher supplied data 3atemperature 3aplanting date 3acarbon dioxide 3asucrose-phosphate synthase 3asugars 3astarch 3atubers 3acrop yield 3agrowing season 3aphloem 3apotatoes 3aabiotic stress 3ahigh-yielding varieties 3aphotosynthesis 3axylem 3aleaves 0aLeaf net CO2 assimilation rate 0aSucrose phosphate synthase 0aPotato 0aHigh temperature 0aPhloem 0aXylem 0acrops1 aDas, Monoj Kumar1 aBaishya, Pitambar1 aRamteke, Anand1 aFārūq, Muḥammad,1 aBaroowa, Bhaswatee1 aSunkar, Ramanjulu1 aGogoi, Nirmali0 tScientia horticulturae.g2017 Nov. 18, v. 225 p.134-140dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4108x0304-42387nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scienta.2017.06.0613Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01962naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002100149245014900170300001600319520077000335592002801105650001601133650002101149650001401170650001101184650001601195650001301211650001901224650001901243700002101262700001801283700002401301700002201325700002301347773012601370856008301496852000901579655001201588IND60087970820221120052143.0141102e20110401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008797082DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jembe.2011.02.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTrancart, Thomas10aSwimming activity responses to water current reversal support selective tidal-stream transport hypothesis in juvenile thinlip mullet Liza ramada  ap. 120-129.  aSwimming activity of thinlip mullet Liza ramada in response to water current reversal was investigated experimentally. A total of 130 young of the year thinlip mullet ranging in size from 22 to 36mm were entered in trials with four different conditions over three weeks. The fish were subjected to current reversal (6.2/6.2h) and a Light–Dark cycle (12/12h). Swimming direction (with or against the current) was video-recorded throughout the experiments. The mullet showed an effective synchronisation of their swimming activity to water current reversal and Light–Dark cycle. This synchronisation could demonstrate the existence of a diurnal selective tidal-stream transport in the natural environment as observed in the two other European catadromous species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLiza ramada 3acatadromous fish 3ajuveniles 3amullet 3aphotoperiod 3aswimming 3awater activity 3awater currents1 aLambert, Patrick1 aRochard, Eric1 aDaverat, Françoise1 aRoqueplo, Charles1 aCoustillas, Julien0 tJournal of experimental marine biology and ecology.g2011 Apr. 1, v. 399, no. 2 p.120-129dElsevier B.V.x0022-09817nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jembe.2011.02.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03492naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094024002200122024001900144040001800163100002100181245016000202300001600362506007600378520158100454592002802035506003702063650001202100650001202112650003302124650001602157650001902173650001102192650001302203650002602216650002002242650001402262650001102276650002402287650001102311651001002322653003602332653002702368653001902395653001502414653006702429653002102496653003202517653002202549653003302571653002002604700003002624700002102654700002302675773012102698856007402819852000902893655001202902IND60624562020221207064153.0181204e20170701xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062456202DNAL7 a10.1093/aob/mcx0462doi7 aPMC57376872pmcid7 a285106312pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSánchez, Ana M.10aHow might edaphic specialists in gypsum islands respond to climate change? Reciprocal sowing experiment to infer local adaptation and phenotypic plasticity  ap. 135-146.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBackground and Aims Local adaptation and phenotypic plasticity are considered key mechanisms for coping with climate warming, especially for plant species that inhabit island-like habitats. In Spain a complete guild of edaphic specialists, most of them threatened, occurs in gypsum outcrops, but how these species will respond to climate change has received little attention. Methods A reciprocal sowing experiment was performed to determine the extent of local adaptation and phenotypic plasticity in five gypsophytes with contrasting distributions along a climate gradient. Germination, seedling growth and survival were recorded during a 4-year period. Key Results Plants responded plastically according to their positions along the regional climate gradient, as well as locally between matched locations. All species exhibited highly plastic responses and stress-tolerant behaviours, especially in terms of seedling survival during summer drought. However, no evidence of local adaptation was detected in any of the locations, where local individuals never performed better than those from other sites. In some sites, both germination and seedling recruitment were higher irrespective of parent plant origin. Conclusions The lack of local adaptation to drought displayed at the regeneration stage indicates limited capacity for in situ genetic response to new climate scenarios. Nevertheless, a plastic response along the climatic gradient does suggest a wider species-level capacity to enable these edaphic specialists to cope with increasing aridity over coming decades.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aclimate 3adrought 3adry environmental conditions 3agermination 3aglobal warming 3agypsum 3ahabitats 3aphenotypic plasticity 3aseedling growth 3aseedlings 3asowing 3aspecies recruitment 3asummer 3aSpain 0aBrassica repanda ssp. gypsicola 0aCentaurea hyssopifolia 0aedaphic island 0agypsophyte 0aHelianthemum marifolium ssp. conquense, Helianthemum squamatum 0alocal adaptation 0aplant–climate interaction 0areciprocal sowing 0aseedling growth and survival 0aThymus lacaitae1 aAlonso-Valiente, Patricia1 aAlbert, M.

Twelve calves experienced four treatments in a cross over 2 &times; 2 factorial design: Calves received an intravenous injection of morphine or saline 10 min prior to being tested individually or in pairs in an arena for 20 min. Play behaviour was continuously recorded in the arena test. Lying times were recorded in the home pen. Cortisol concentrations were measured before and after testing. In the arena test, calves given morphine tended to perform more social play events than calves given saline, however, morphine administration had no effect on locomotor play. Calves given morphine spent less time lying than calves given saline during the first 4 h after returning to the home pen. Cortisol concentrations were suppressed in calves given morphine. Administration of morphine appeared to increase social play but had no effect on locomotor play in calves. This study highlights the importance of investigating different aspects of play behaviour in animals as some may be more indicative of a positive affective state than others. More studies investigating the effects of morphine on play are needed to confirm the results found in this study.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acalves 3acortisol 3aintravenous injection 3amorphine1 aWorth, Gemma 1 aCameron, Catherine 1 aVerbeek, Else 0 tAnimals.g2019 Feb. 12, v. 9, no. 2dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2274x2076-26157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ani90200563Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02901naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002600113040001800139100002900157245012200186300001800308520128400326592002801610650000901638650001401647650001101661650002401672650001501696650001801711650000901729650001301738650001901751650001201770650000901782650004601791650002901837650002601866650001101892650002101903650001101924650003201935650000901967650001601976650003901992650001702031650001902048650001202067650002002079700001802099700001602117700002502133773009602158856007202254852000902326655001202335IND60082494820221121072310.0141025e201411  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008249482DNAL7 a250438562pmid7 a10.1002/ptr.51922doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChrubasik‐Hausmann, S.12aA Pilot Study on the Effectiveness of a Rose Hip Shell Powder in Patients Suffering from Chronic Musculoskeletal Pain  ap. 1720-1726.  aWe carried out a 3‐month preliminary investigation on the effectiveness of a rose hip shell powder and its mechanism of action. Of 52 patients suffering from acute exacerbations of low back pain (n = 39) or knee pain (n = 13), 29 had participated earlier in the pilot study with the pseudofruit powder Litozin®. After assessing the baseline values, patients were offered up to 20 g of a rose hip shell powder per day. Patients were encouraged to adjust the daily dose upwards or downwards according to their symptoms for the period of 3 months. The examination for possible effectiveness was by intention‐to‐treat analysis with last observation carried forward. There was no difference in any generic or disease‐specific outcome variables between the patients consuming the rose hip shell powder and those consuming the pseudofruit powder Litozin® in the previous surveillance study. A human protein array system and fractions from the rose powders were used to study their effect on cytokine expression in vitro. The data indicate that lipophilic rose hip fractions from the shell and the pseudofruit inhibit cytokine expression and that the shell powder may be the better starting material for a future rose hip extract prepared with a lipophilic solvent.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRosa 3acytokines 3ahumans 3amechanism of action 3amonitoring 3anormal values 3apain 3apatients 3aplant extracts 3apowders 2aAged 2aAnti-Inflammatory Agentsxtherapeutic use 2aArthralgiaxdrug therapy 2aCytokinesxmetabolism 2aFemale 2aFruitxchemistry 2aHumans 2aLow Back Painxdrug therapy 2aMale 2aMiddle Aged 2aMusculoskeletal Painxdrug therapy 2aPhytotherapy 2aPilot Projects 2aPowders 2aRosaxchemistry1 aChrubasik, C.1 aNeumann, E.1 aMüller‐Ladner, U.0 tPhytotherapy research.g2014 Nov., v. 28, no. 11 p.1720-1726dHeyden & Sonx0951-418X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ptr.51923Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03478naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100001600166245009600182300001600278520223100294592002802525650001702553650001002570650003002580650002302610650001302633650001302646650001502659650001102674650002702685650001602712653002302728653001802751653001302769653001102782700001402793700001902807700001702826773011002843856008202953852000903035655001203044IND60516142320221120035236.0190804e201505  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051614232DNAL7 a255230622pmid7 a10.1017/S17517311140031392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFortier, J.10aQuantification of the energy expenditure during training exercises in Standardbred trotters  ap. 793-799.  aAn appropriate energy feeding management that ensures the optimal dietary energy supply according to the energy expenditure (EE) is a crucial component for the horse’s performance. The main purpose of this study was to determine the EE during four specific exercises used in the training of Standardbred trotters (promenade, jogging, parcours and interval work-outs). A total of six Standardbred geldings performed four different testing situations on a track. The intensity (expressed in percentage of the maximal velocity over 500 m, i.e. v500) and volume (distance and duration) of the testing situations were determined according to practices reported by French trainers. Promenade and jogging included only an exercise phase, whereas parcours and interval situations also included a warm-up and a recovery phase. Oxygen uptake (VO₂), carbon dioxide production (VCO₂) and heart rate (HR) were continuously recorded from 2 min before the beginning through to the end of the testing situations, using a portable respiratory gas analyser. Blood lactate levels and rectal temperature were determined before and immediately after the exercise phase of each testing situations. EE of the different phases (warm-up, exercise and recovery) and EE of the entire testing situations (EETOTAL) were calculated from VO₂ measurements and the O₂ caloric equivalent. Interval and parcours situations induced higher physiological responses than promenade and jogging situations, particularly in terms of VO₂ₚₑₐₖ, VCO₂ₚₑₐₖ and HRₚₑₐₖ. The highest blood lactate concentration (6 mmol/l) was measured after the interval exercise, and respiratory exchange ratios ⩾1 were observed only for the parcours situation. The EE of exercise phase varied from 0.49 to 1.79 kJ/min per kg for promenade and parcours situations. The EE of warm-up and recovery phases did not differ between parcours and interval situations, and was estimated at 1.04 and 0.57 kJ/min per kg BW, respectively. On average, the warm-up and the recovery phases contributed to 38% and 19% of the EETOTAL. For promenade, jogging, parcours and interval situations, EETOTAL was evaluated at 12 618, 11 119, 13 698 and 18 119 kJ, respectively.  aPublisher supplied data 3aStandardbred 3ablood 3acarbon dioxide production 3aenergy expenditure 3aexercise 3ageldings 3aheart rate 3aoxygen 3aphysiological response 3atemperature 0aenergy expenditure 0aoxygen uptake 0awork out 0ahorses1 aDeley, G.1 aGoachet, A.-G.1 aJulliand, V.0 tAnimal.g2015 May, v. 9, no. 5 p.793-799dCambridge University PresswJournal:jnl3938811x1751-732X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S17517311140031393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02454naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001400155245014600169300001200315520109500327592002801422650001801450650002101468650002401489650002801513650001001541650002501551650001501576650001701591650001901608650002001627650002501647653002001672653002301692653002501715653002601740700001501766700001401781700001401795700001401809773008701823856008901910852000901999655001202008IND60618080320221118102215.0181029e201812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061808032DNAL7 a10.1016/j.compositesa.2018.09.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Li10aEnhanced thermal conductivity and electrical insulation properties of polymer composites via constructing Pglass/CNTs confined hybrid fillers  ap. 1-7.  aThe preparation of thermal conductive and electrical insulating polymer composites has gained extensive interest due to their important applications. The morphological control of functional fillers is thought as an effective approach to achieve this. Herein, a novel method involves the confinement of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) in phosphate glass (Pglass) domains is presented. Due to the large interfacial tension between Pglass and polymer matrix, strong confinement of CNTs can be achieved while CNTs is incorporated into Pglass. Thus, the formation of CNTs conductive networks in polymer matrix can be prohibited in ternary polymer/Pglass/CNTs composites. Comparing with similar composites having high density polyethylene (HDPE) to realize confinement on CNTs, much higher thermal conductivity and much lower electrical conductivity are observed in polymer composites based on polypropylene (PP) containing boron nitride (BN). It is thought that the use of Pglass can provide an effective method for the preparation of thermally conductive and electrically insulating polymer composites.  aPublisher supplied data 3aboron nitride 3acarbon nanotubes 3acomposite materials 3aelectrical conductivity 3aglass 3ainsulating materials 3aphosphates 3apolyethylene 3apolypropylenes 3asurface tension 3athermal conductivity 0aPhosphate glass 0aPolymer composites 0aThermal conductivity 0aElectrical insulation1 aLi, Xingyu1 aDeng, Hua1 aJing, Yao1 aFu, Qiang0 tComposites.g2018 Dec., v. 115 p.1-7dElsevier LtdwJournal:12034x1359-835X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.compositesa.2018.09.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03222naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094024002200122024001900144040001800163100002300181245010600204506007600310520159300386592002801979506003702007650001302044650001202057650001502069650002402084650001202108650002002120650001402140650000902154650001302163650002302176650001802199650001202217650002102229650001902250650001302269650001202282650002302294650001502317650001102332650001602343651001402359700002402373700002302397700002102420700002502441773011902466856007402585852000902659655001202668IND60647291820221207134927.0190618e20190213xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064729182DNAL7 a10.3390/ani90200572doi7 aPMC64068572pmcid7 a307818222pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDunshea, Frank  R.10aBetaine Improves Milk Yield in Grazing Dairy Cows Supplemented with Concentrates at High Temperatures  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBetaine is an organic osmolyte sourced from sugar beet that accumulates in plant cells undergoing osmotic stress. Since the accumulation of betaine lowers the energy requirements of animals and, therefore, metabolic heat production, the aim of this experiment was to investigate if betaine supplementation improved milk yield in grazing dairy cows in summer. One hundred and eighteen Friesian &times; Holstein cows were paired on days in milk and, within each pair, randomly allocated to a containing treatment of either 0 or 2 g/kg natural betaine in their concentrate ration for approximately 3 weeks during February/March 2015 (summer in Australia). The mean maximum February temperature was 30 &deg;C. Cows were allocated approximately 14 kg dry matter pasture and 7.5 kg of concentrate pellets (fed in the milking shed) per cow per day and were milked through an automatic milking system three times per day. Betaine supplementation increased average daily milk yield by over 6% (22.0 vs. 23.4 kg/day, p < 0.001) with the response increasing as the study progressed as indicated by the interaction (p < 0.001) between betaine and day. Milk fat % (p = 0.87), milk protein % (p = 0.90), and milk somatic cell count (p = 0.81) were unchanged by dietary betaine. However, betaine supplementation increased milk protein yield (677 vs. 719 g/day, p < 0.001) and fat yield (874 vs. 922 g/day, p < 0.001) with responses again being more pronounced as the study progressed. In conclusion, dietary betaine supplementation increased milk and component yield during summer in grazing dairy cows.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aHolstein 3abetaine 3adairy cows 3aenergy requirements 3agrazing 3aheat production 3alactation 3amilk 3amilk fat 3amilk protein yield 3amilk proteins 3amilking 3amilking machines 3aosmotic stress 3apastures 3apellets 3asomatic cell count 3asugar beet 3asummer 3atemperature 3aAustralia1 aOluboyede, Kehinde 1 aDiGiacomo, Kristy 1 aLeury, Brian  J.1 aCottrell, Jeremy  J.0 tAnimals.g2019 Feb. 13, v. 9, no. 2dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2274x2076-26157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ani90200573Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03219naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002600113040001800139100002100157245011900178300001800297520167400315592002801989650001402017650001302031650001102044650001402055650000902069650000902078650001402087650001002101650003102111650004302142650002902185650001102214650001102225650002602236650001402262650001602276650004802292650004402340650003702384650002202421650002102443650002302464700001402487700002302501773009602524856007202620852000902692655001202701IND60082494920221121100719.0141025e201411  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008249492DNAL7 a248025242pmid7 a10.1002/ptr.51632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee, Kyung‐Bok10aChanges in 5‐hydroxytryptamine and Cortisol Plasma Levels in Menopausal Women After Inhalation of Clary Sage Oil  ap. 1599-1605.  aThe purpose of this study was to examine the antidepressant‐like effects of clary sage oil on human beings by comparing the neurotransmitter level change in plasma. The voluntary participants were 22 menopausal women in 50's. Subjects were classified into normal and depression tendency groups using each of Korean version of Beck Depression Inventory‐I (KBDI‐I), KBDI‐II, and Korean version of Self‐rating Depression Scale. Then, the changes in neurotransmitter concentrations were compared between two groups. After inhalation of clary sage oil, cortisol levels were significantly decreased while 5‐hydroxytryptamine (5‐HT) concentration was significantly increased. Thyroid stimulating hormone was also reduced in all groups but not statistically significantly. The different change rate of 5‐HT concentration between normal and depression tendency groups was variable according to the depression measurement inventory. When using KBDI‐I and KBDI‐II, 5‐HT increased by 341% and 828% for the normal group and 484% and 257% for the depression tendency group, respectively. The change rate of cortisol was greater in depression tendency groups compared with normal groups, and this difference was statistically significant when using KBDI‐II (31% vs. 16% reduction) and Self‐rating Depression Scale inventory (36% vs. 8.3% reduction). Among three inventories, only KBDI‐II differentiated normal and depression tendency groups with significantly different cortisol level. Finally, clary sage oil has antidepressant‐like effect, and KBDI‐II inventory may be the most sensitive and valid tool in screening for depression status or severity.  aPublisher supplied data 3abreathing 3acortisol 3ahumans 3amenopause 3aoils 3asage 3ascreening 3awomen 2aAdministration, Inhalation 2aAntidepressive Agentsxtherapeutic use 2aDepressionxdrug therapy 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aHydrocortisonexblood 2aMenopause 2aMiddle Aged 2aOils, Volatilexchemistryxtherapeutic use. 2aPlant Oilsxchemistryxtherapeutic use. 2aPsychiatric Status Rating Scales 2aSalviaxchemistry 2aSerotoninxblood 2aThyrotropinxblood1 aCho, Ŭn,1 aKang, Young‐Sook0 tPhytotherapy research.g2014 Nov., v. 28, no. 11 p.1599-1605dHeyden & Sonx0951-418X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ptr.51633Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02085naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001400155245007000169300001300239520101700252592002801269650002401297650001701321650001401338650001601352650001101368653004001379653002401419653002801443653001501471700001501486700001501501700002001516773008801536856009001624852000901714655001201723IND60618080420221118100615.0181127e201901  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061808042DNAL7 a10.1016/j.compositesa.2018.10.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWagih, A.10aScaling effects of composite laminates under out-of-plane loading  ap. 1-12.  aThe scaling effects of composite laminates under quasi-static indentation and low-velocity impact tests are studied with the aim of reducing the experimental cost of low-velocity impact tests. First, an analytical model is proposed using some equations available in the simplified analytical models in the literature and other equations derived in this work to predict the quasi-static indentation response during the elastic and delamination regime up to fiber failure. The model is able to predict the load-displacement response and delamination area. Finally, the effect of scaling the geometrical parameters such as in-plane dimension and shape, thickness of the laminate, thickness of the plies and indenter radius is analyzed. This scaling approach is developed based on the presented analytical model and the experimental results available in the literature. As a result, it is possible to predict the response of large structures under impact loads by testing small coupons under static indentation test.  aPublisher supplied data 3acomposite materials 3adelamination 3aequations 3aimpact load 3amodels 0aA.

Such protection will require long-term, regional monitoring of the resource using biological indicators and a probability-based sampling design. A 60-station survey targeting nearshore linear coral reef was conducted across southern Puerto Rico in December 2011 to document the status of reef inhabitants using a probabilistic, regional sampling design. The quantity, type and condition of stony corals, fish, gorgonians, and sponges were documented from each station, providing a robust representation of linear reef status and composition across the region. Fish represented 106 unique taxa and stony corals 32 unique taxa. Benthic organisms (stony corals, sponges, and gorgonians) averaged nearly 12 colonies per square meter, more than half of which were gorgonians. Assessment results can be used as a baseline to compare with future regional surveys to quantify change in reef condition over time (trend). Both temporal and spatial changes can be expected after large-scale disturbances like hurricanes Maria and Irma in 2017. The indicators and probabilistic sampling design support the long-term regional monitoring envisioned by the Environmental Protection Agency to implement CWA protections in Puerto Rico and elsewhere.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aClean Water Act 3aScleractinia 3aUnited States Environmental Protection Agency 3abenthic organisms 3acoastal zone management 3acoral reefs 3afish 3ahurricanes 3aindicator species 3amonitoring 3aregional surveys 3awater quality standards 3aPuerto Rico 3aUnited States 0abiocriteria 0abiological criteria 0acoral reef biological status assessments 0aprobability-based regional sampling1 aVivian, Deborah N.1 aCampbell, Jed1 aLobue, Charles1 aHemmer, Rebecca L.1 aWilkinson, Sherry1 aHarris, Peggy1 aSantavy, Deborah L.1 aParsons, Mel1 aBradley, Patricia1 aHumphrey, Alan1 aOliver, Leah M.1 aHarwell, Linda0 tCoastal management.g2019 Sept. 3, v. 47, no. 5 p.429-452dTaylor & FranciswJournal:12309x1521-04217nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/08920753.2019.16410393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02542naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245007900170300001400249520135300263592002801616650001501644650002201659650001201681650001401693650001501707650002201722650000701744650001101751650000901762650002301771650001301794651001201807651001101819653001301830653001301843653001301856653001201869653001001881700001901891700001801910773009601928856005102024852000902075655001202084IND50075548120221118211618.0140410e20120201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007554812DNAL7 a10.1080/02757540.2011.6195312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aŠiljeg, Mario,14aThe removal of arsenic from water with natural and modified clinoptilolite  ap. 75-87.  aThe presence of increased arsenic concentrations in Eastern Croatia is a consequence of the geological composition of the soil. Because of its known harmful effects, arsenic removal is of high importance and adsorption represents an attractive and economically efficient approach to arsenic removal. The use of zeolites obtained from the Donje Jesenje deposit, Croatia (CZ) and the Zlatokop deposit in Vranjska Banja, Serbia (SZ) in Na- and Fe–Na-modified forms was investigated in order to effectively remove arsenate and arsenite from aqueous solutions. The adsorption kinetics of arsenic was studied as a function of the initial arsenate and arsenite concentrations (30–300 μg · L⁻¹), equilibration time (3–48 h), pH (5–10) and in the presence of sulfate and phosphate at initial concentrations of 0.2–0.5 mg · L⁻¹. In order to estimate sorption constants designating the sorption capacity and affinity of the zeolites samples, the experimental results were fitted to the Langmuir and Freundlich sorption isotherms. Desorption tests conducted with 1–3 mol · L⁻¹ HCl indicated that arsenate sorption was irreversible. The results obtained indicated that use of the Serbian zeolite in the Fe–Na-modified form (Fe–Na-SZ) was favourable for arsenate removal from water containing up to 30 μg As · L⁻¹.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3aaqueous solutions 3aarsenic 3aarsenites 3adesorption 3ahydrochloric acid 3apH 3asodium 3asoil 3asorption isotherms 3azeolites 3aCroatia 3aSerbia 0aarsenate 0aarsenite 0asorption 0azeolite 0awater1 aFoglar, Lucija1 aGudelj, Ivana0 tChemistry in ecology.g2012 Feb. 1, v. 28, no. 1 p.75-87dTaylor & Francisx1029-03707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02757540.2011.619531  aDNAL 7aarticle02251naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002300155245013200178300001600310520101000326592002801336650001501364650001101379650001701390650001301407650001901420650001901439650001301458650001501471653001801486653002201504653002901526653003001555700003001585700006101615773009101676856008901767852000901856655001201865IND60618080520221118100612.0181029e201812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061808052DNAL7 a10.1016/j.compositesa.2018.10.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZaccardi, Federica10aQuantitative assessment of nanofiller dispersion based on grayscale image analysis: A case study on epoxy/carbon nanocomposites  ap. 302-310.  aFiller dispersion in polymer matrices plays an important role in defining the performance of nanocomposite materials. Here, a novel method for the quantitative assessment of filler dispersion is reported. The method is based on the direct analysis of optical images using an algorithm implemented in MATLAB, which considers the distance of each pixel with respect to pixels of same value and to pixels of different value. A dispersion index is determined by comparing the grayscale optical image with the corresponding uniformly dispersed image. The algorithm was used to study the dispersion state of samples containing different types of graphene nanoplatelets dispersed in Prime 20 LV epoxy at different concentrations and sonication times.

To test whether seedlings of native plants can become established without extirpating invasive plants, we evaluated the survival and growth of seedlings of a native tree species, Schima mertensiana, planted under closed forest dominated by an invasive species, Casuarina equisetifolia in the Ogasawara Islands, an oceanic archipelago in the western Pacific Ocean. The initial establishment of S. mertensiana is inhibited by the highly accumulated litter of C. equisetifolia; therefore, few seedlings and saplings of S. mertensiana were observed in the forest. We planted seedlings of three initial size classes, and their size parameters (diameter at ground level, height, and number of leaves) were monitored for 69 months. More than 75% of the planted seedlings survived during the study period. There were no significant differences in the number of surviving seedlings among the initial size classes. Steady growth of seedlings was observed regardless of initial size class. Our results indicate that planted S. mertensiana seedlings can survive and grow in forests without removing C. equisetifolia, and provide a case study that shows that planted seedlings of a native woody species can establish under a closed canopy dominated by an invasive woody species, at least for several years.  aThis research was largely supported by the Environment Research and Technology Development Fund of the Ministry of the Environment, Japan (4-1402), and partly by JSPS KAKENHI [Grant Number 24710274].  aPublisher supplied data  a4-1402cthe Environment Research and Technology Development Funddhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100006120  a24710274cJSPS KAKENHI Grantdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001691 3aCasuarina equisetifolia 3aSchima 3acanopy 3acase studies 3aecological function 3aforests 3aindigenous species 3ainvasive species 3aresearch 3awoody plants 3aPacific Ocean 0aBonin (Ogasawara) Islands 0aextirpation 0aSchima mertensiana 0atransplanting1 aKachi, Naoki0 tJournal of forest research.g2017 Mar. 4, v. 22, no. 2 p.135-140dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl3870061x1610-74037nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13416979.2017.12840313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01891naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002700151245013900178300001600317520067400333592002801007650001901035650003001054650001501084650001401099650001001113651001401123653001801137653003201155653002401187653002501211700003601236700002401272773013801296856008601434852000901520655001201529IND60758943320221120180706.0211204e20220102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075894332DNAL7 a10.1080/07900627.2021.19310522doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHerrera Arango, Johana10aMurky waters: the impact of privatizing water use on environmental degradation and the exclusion of local communities in the Caribbean  ap. 152-172.  aThe effects of climate change on tropical ecosystems cannot be interpreted based on physical variables alone.

One important step towards such a goal is the discovery of the function of genes that will lead to a better understanding of the physiology and pathophysiology of organisms, which will ultimately lead to better diagnosis and therapy. Our increasing ability to phenotypically characterise genetic variants of model organisms coupled with systematic and hypothesis-driven mutagenesis is resulting in a wealth of information that could potentially provide insight into the functions of all genes in an organism. The challenge we are now facing is to develop computational methods that can integrate and analyse such data. The introduction of formal ontologies that make their semantics explicit and accessible to automated reasoning provides the tantalizing possibility of standardizing biomedical knowledge allowing for novel, powerful queries that bridge multiple domains, disciplines, species, and levels of granularity. We review recent computational approaches that facilitate the integration of experimental data from model organisms with clinical observations in humans. These methods foster novel cross-species analysis approaches, thereby enabling comparative phenomics and leading to the potential of translating basic discoveries from the model systems into diagnostic and therapeutic advances at the clinical level.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3agenes 3ahuman physiology 3ahumans 3amutagenesis 3apathophysiology 3atherapeutics 2aAnimals 2aComputer Simulation 2aHumans 2aPhenotype1 aSchofield, Paul N.1 aHoehndorf, Robert0 tMammalian genome.g2012 Oct., v. 23, no. 9-10 p.669-679dSpringer-Verlagx0938-89907nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00335-012-9404-4  aDNAL 7aarticle02556naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245010200171300001800273520156000291592002801851650000801879650001501887650001601902650001201918650001501930650002001945650001501965700005501980773011402035856008402149852000902233655001202242IND60746407320221123041638.0210803e20210726xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074640732DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.langmuir.1c007832doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZandieh, Mohamad10aMetal-Doped Polydopamine Nanoparticles for Highly Robust and Efficient DNA Adsorption and Sensing  ap. 8953-8960.  aControlling DNA adsorption on nanomaterials is crucial for a wide range of applications in analytical and biomedical sciences. Polydopamine (PDA) is a versatile material that can be coated on nearly any surface, and thus adsorbing DNA onto PDA can be a general method for indirect DNA functionalization of surfaces. Polyvalent metal ions were reported to promote DNA adsorption on PDA nanoparticles (NPs), but previous works added the metal ions after the formation of PDA. Herein, we compared the effect of polyvalent metal ions added during the synthesis of PDA NPs (called metal-doped) with the effect of polyvalent metal ions added after the synthesis (metal-adsorbed). A series of metal ions including Ca²⁺, Zn²⁺, Ni²⁺, Fe³⁺, and Gd³⁺ were tested, and Zn²⁺ was studied in detail due to its excellent ability for promoting DNA adsorption. With 100 μM Zn²⁺, metal-doped NPs were ∼30% more efficient than metal-adsorbed NPs for DNA adsorption in buffer attributable to a higher metal loading on the surface of the metal-doped NPs. Metal leaching was negligible from the metal-doped NPs, and they showed a remarkably higher robustness than the metal-adsorbed NPs, resulting in a 20-fold higher DNA extraction efficiency from serum. Based on the desorption studies, a higher adsorption affinity for the metal-doped NPs was confirmed. Finally, the Zn²⁺-doped PDA NPs were used for sensitive DNA detection with a limit of detection of 0.45 nM, and the sensor was highly resistant to nonspecific protein and phosphate displacement.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aadsorption 3ablood serum 3acalcium 3adesorption 3adetection limit 3aphosphates1 aLiu, Juewen1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5918-93360 tLangmuir.g2021 July 26, v. 37, no. 30 p.8953-8960dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19170x1520-58277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.langmuir.1c007833Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02341naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002700149245015000176300001600326520115500342592002801497650001801525650002301543650001101566650001501577650001601592650001201608650001301620650001201633650001701645700002001662700002201682700002401704700002101728773012601749856008301875852000901958655001201967IND60087971220221120113045.0141102e20110401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008797122DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jembe.2011.01.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGómez Laich, Agustina10aUse of overall dynamic body acceleration for estimating energy expenditure in cormorants Does locomotion in different media affect relationships?  ap. 151-155.  aThe way in which animals use and acquire energy is fundamental to their fitness. Overall dynamic body acceleration (ODBA) has recently been suggested as a new method for the determination of energy expenditure in wild animals. Although the relationship between ODBA and energy expenditure has been calibrated using gas-respirometry, it has only been validated for animals moving in a single medium. In this work we examined whether the relationship between ODBA and energy expenditure varies between activity types and in particular, how locomotion in different media affects the regressions using the Imperial Cormorant Phalacrocorax atriceps as a model species. Regressing mean ODBA values for resting, diving and walking periods on a single graph against mean power values, the mass-specific power (Wkg⁻¹) was related to ODBA via; Power=12.09+41.31 ODBA (r²=0.93). Although values for resting, walking and swimming all fell close to a single linear fit, values for flight deviated substantially from this. The different relationships found between locomotory types are discussed in terms of the muscle groups involved in each kind of behavior.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPhalacrocorax 3aenergy expenditure 3aflight 3alocomotion 3amethodology 3amuscles 3aswimming 3awalking 3awild animals1 aWilson, Rory P.1 aGleiss, Adrian C.1 aShepard, Emily L.C.1 aQuintana, Flavio0 tJournal of experimental marine biology and ecology.g2011 Apr. 1, v. 399, no. 2 p.151-155dElsevier B.V.x0022-09817nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jembe.2011.01.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02673naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100001600166245007400182300001600256520138400272592002801656650001501684650001801699650001501717650001301732650000901745650001201754650001601766650000901782650001201791650001201803650001601815650001201831653001901843653001201862653001501874653002001889653001701909700001501926700001701941700001501958700001701973773011001990856008202100852000902182655001202191IND60516142620221120035113.0190804e201505  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051614262DNAL7 a255576522pmid7 a10.1017/S17517311140031762doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLonardi, C.10aCan novel methods be useful for pain assessment of castrated piglets?  ap. 871-877.  aGiven that surgical castration is a painful practice performed on millions of pigs every year, a need to identify novel reliable pain assessment tools exists in order to test anaesthetic and analgesic protocols that may reduce related pain. Two treatments were considered: handling (H) and surgical castration (C). Physiological (cortisol, lactate, glycaemia, rectal and eye temperature) and behavioural variables (latency to move after treatment and alterations in posture and walking) were analysed. Cortisol showed the greatest level in C piglets within 20 min after the surgical procedure and a positive correlation with glucose concentration. Eye temperature was higher in C piglets, and the same difference was detected for rectal temperature 3 h after castration. Behavioural parameters revealed that C piglets had longer latency to move and a higher percentage of them showed alterations in posture and walking. Results of this study showed that, in castrated piglets behavioural and physiological alterations occur mainly in the first 3 h from treatment. Latency to move, alterations in posture and walking, and eye temperature appear to give additional and useful information in piglet pain assessment. However, differently from the behavioural parameters considered, eye temperature involves several manipulations of the animals and a long process to acquire the data.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanalgesics 3ablood glucose 3acastration 3acortisol 3aeyes 3aglucose 3amethodology 3apain 3apiglets 3aposture 3atemperature 3awalking 0aanimal welfare 0apiglets 0acastration 0apain assessment 0athermography1 aScollo, A.1 aNormando, S.1 aBrscic, M.1 aGottardo, F.0 tAnimal.g2015 May, v. 9, no. 5 p.871-877dCambridge University PresswJournal:jnl3938811x1751-732X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S17517311140031763Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02107naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002000155245011800175300001600293520082600309592002801135650001101163650002401174650001701198650001301215650002601228650003001254650001001284653003501294653002901329653002401358653001901382700001801401700001601419700001701435700001301452700001701465700001401482773009101496856008901587852000901676655001201685IND60618080820221118100555.0181029e201812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061808082DNAL7 a10.1016/j.compositesa.2018.10.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Diantang10aEffects of off-axis angle on shear progressive damage of 3D woven composites with X-ray micro-computed tomography  ap. 311-320.  aThis paper presents the influence of the off-axis angles on the shear progressive damage of three-dimensional (3D) woven carbon/epoxy composites. Five kind of samples with different angles, 0°, 30°, 45°, 60° and 90°, of the weft and warp yarn orientation are experimentally tested via short beam shear method. X-ray micro-computed tomography (Micro-CT) techniques are employed to identify the internal damage initiation/evolution of 3D woven composites. Results indicate that the off-axis angles have significant effects on the mechanical behaviors, damage change and final failure mechanisms. Furthermore, the ultimate strength of on-axis samples are mainly influenced by the yarn tensile fracture and delamination, whereas those of off-axis samples are largely governed by the debonding and yarn pull-out breakage.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3acomposite materials 3adelamination 3aepoxides 3amechanical properties 3amicro-computed tomography 3ayarns 0aA. 3-Dimensional reinforcement 0aB.

K.10aFirst Report of Fusarium solani Causing Root Rot on Fenugreek (Trigonella foenum-graecum) in India  aFenugreek (Trigonella foenum-graecum L.), a leafy vegetable known for its medicinal properties, is economically important in both the national and international markets. In India, approximately 90,000 metric tons of fenugreek is produced from a total 66,000 cultivated hectares annually (Rani and Hegde 2017). In a survey from December 2017 to March 2018, root rot disease was observed in eight fenugreek farms in the Satara district, Maharashtra. Incidence ranged from 35 to 54%. Infected plants showed gradual yellowing, defoliation of the lower leaves, wilting, and stunting. The roots of infected plants were brown, with decayed cortical tissues that shriveled and resembled a thread. The causal agent was isolated from infected roots on potato dextrose agar (PDA) medium. The symptomatic roots were cut into pieces, surface sterilized with 2% sodium hypochlorite for 2 min, rinsed thrice with sterile distilled water, and placed on PDA plates that were incubated at 27 ± 1°C for 5 to 7 days. After 7 days, a floccose, white colony that was dull yellow on the underside was observed. Conidiophores produced from lateral hyphae were simple to branched, 74.60 µm (length) × 3 µm (width). Phialides produced from lateral hyphae were slender, smooth, hyaline, and septate. The rarely produced macroconidia were two to three septate, smooth-walled, hyaline, with foot cell absent, and sickle-shaped. Microconidia were produced in a group mass from long cylindrical phialides 3.85 to 4.5 × 8.16 to 13.17 µm (n = 20). Based on morphological characteristics the isolated causal agent of root rot was identified as a fungus belonging to the Fusarium genus. The isolate was further identified based on PCR amplification and sequencing of the internal transcribed spacer (ITS), translation elongation factor (EF-1α), and RNA polymerase II (RPB1) genes according to the method described by O’Donnell et al. (2008) and Ghule et al. (2018). The DNA sequences were deposited to NCBI GenBank. NCBI BLASTn sequence analysis of this isolate, namely, ITS (MN243824), EF-1α (MN201580), and RPB1 (MN264211), showed 100% similarity with the ITS (KY910884, 557/557 base pairs), EF-1α (DQ247490, 473/473 base pair), and RPB1 (JN98516, 670/670 base pairs) sequences of Fusarium solani, respectively. A culture of F. solani FS5 was deposited in the National Fungal Culture Collection of India (NFCCI), Agharkar Research Institute, Pune, India. (accession no. NFCCI-4501). A pathogenicity test was conducted on a susceptible fenugreek cultivar under net-house conditions (25 to 30°C). The inoculum was prepared in Erlenmeyer flasks containing 220 g of a mixture of sterilized sand/maize meal medium (10:1). A mycelial disc (8 mm in diameter) of 8-day-old F. solani was placed in medium and incubated at 25°C for 21 days. F. solani inoculum (40 g/pot) was mixed with sterilized soil in plastic pots and placed in a net house 5 days prior to sowing. On the sixth day, 20 fenugreek seeds were surface sterilized and sown in each pot. Typical symptoms of root rot were observed 16 to 20 days after sowing. All inoculated plants wilted and died after 30 days, whereas the control plants sown in noninoculated sterile soil remained healthy. The pathogen was reisolated from the roots of symptomatic plants and was found to be morphologically and culturally identical to inoculated isolate. F. solani causing root rot disease on fenugreek in Egypt (Ali et al. 2018) was recently reported. However, in India, the causal agents of root rot and wilt disease of fenugreek were previously reported to be Fusarium oxysporum, Rhizoctonia solani, and Sclerotium rolfsii (Rani and Hegde 2017). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of F. solani causing root rot on fenugreek (T. foenum-graecum) in India. The demand for fenugreek has drastically increased in spice-based industries; therefore, successful cultivation of this crop is of great importance, and root rot disease caused by F. solani poses a serious threat to fenugreek production. Hence, further study on the prevalence of this pathogen and its management for successful production of fenugreek in India is needed.  aPublisher supplied data  cUniversity Grants Commission, New Delhi, India 3aAthelia rolfsii 3aDNA 3aDNA-directed RNA polymerase 3aFusarium oxysporum 3aFusarium solani 3aSclerotium (genus) 3aThanatephorus cucumeris 3aTrigonella foenum-graecum 3aconidia 3aconidiophores 3acorn meal 3acrop production 3acultivars 3aculture media 3adefoliation 3afarms 3afenugreek 3afungal culture 3afungi 3agenes 3agrowth retardation 3ahyphae 3aindustry 3ainoculum 3ainternal transcribed spacers 3aleaves 3amedicinal properties 3amycelium 3apathogenicity 3apathogens 3apeptide elongation factors 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aroot rot 3aroots 3asand 3aseeds 3asequence analysis 3asodium hypochlorite 3asoil 3asoil sterilization 3asowing 3asurveys 3avascular wilt 3avegetables 3awilting 3aworld markets 3aIndia 0aroot rot disease1 aGhule, M.

To do this, two ESS scheduling algorithms are developed to participate in the DR program in South Korea. The first algorithm is designed to maximize the customer's profit using energy arbitrage, after which the remaining ESS capacity is used to participate in the DR program. The second algorithm is designed to maintain its self-consumption at a minimum so that the ESS can participate in the DR program as much as possible. In addition, both algorithms have the same objectives of minimizing the peak demand in order to reduce the contract power as well as to minimize the charge/discharge cycles in order to lengthen the life of ESS. The developed algorithms are validated using the actual industrial load profiles with ESS. Furthermore, the economic analysis is performed when ESS that applies two different algorithms participates in the DR program. The simulation results indicate that the proposed algorithm prioritizing the self-consumption shows a relatively higher profit than that obtained by prioritizing the DR participation owing to uncompetitive compensation of the current South Korea DR program.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3aeconomic analysis 3aenergy 3aSouth Korea 0aEnergy Storage System (ESS) 0aDemand Response (DR) 0aESS scheduling 0aLoad forecasting 0aPeak shaving 0aArbitrage1 aKang, Byung O1 aJung, Jaesung0 tEnergy.g2018 Oct. 15, v. 161 p.963-973dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2018.07.1903Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02800naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005500148245015300203300001200356520150700368592002801875650002201903650001901925650001301944650001901957650001801976650001301994650001402007650000702021650001302028650003302041650001302074650002602087651001102113700002502124700002602149773013502175856008302310852000902393655001202402IND60753281620221121211718.0220524e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075328162DNAL7 a10.1186/s12302-021-00555-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGhavi, Azam1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9033-139310aDegradation of paraquat herbicide using hybrid AOP process: statistical optimization, kinetic study, and estimation of electrical energy consumption  ap. 117.  aBACKGROUND: This work studied the performance of UV/PS/TiO₂NPs and UV/PI/TiO₂NPs as hybrid advanced oxidation processes for degradation of paraquat in aqueous solution, because this very toxic herbicide is used third most widely. RESULTS: The effects of several factors such as UV irradiation, initial oxidant concentration, TiO₂ nanoparticles dosage, and pH on the degradation efficiency were investigated. The process optimization was performed by the central composite design as a tool of response surface methodology for 30 mgL⁻¹ of the herbicide initial concentration at 25 ℃ and 40 min of degradation process. Based on the results, a degradation efficiency of 77% and 90% were obtained for the UV/PS/TiO₂NPs and UV/PI/TiO₂NPs processes, respectively, in the optimum conditions. The mineralization efficiency of the paraquat solution using UV/PS/TiO₂NPs and UV/PI/TiO₂NPs processes are about 32% and 55%, respectively, after 40 min. The kinetic studies show that both processes follow a pseudo-first-order kinetic model, and the kinetic constants are 0.0299 min⁻¹ for the PS process and 0.0604 min⁻¹ for the PI process. The electrical energy consumption was estimated to be about 481.60 kWhm⁻³ for the PS process and 238.41 kWhm⁻³ for the PI process. CONCLUSIONS: The degradation and mineralization efficiency of the paraquat solution using the UV/PI/TiO₂NPs process was more than that of the UV/PS/TiO₂NPs process at the optimum conditions after 40 min.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaqueous solutions 3aelectric power 3akinetics 3amineralization 3ananoparticles 3aoxidants 3aoxidation 3apH 3aparaquat 3aresponse surface methodology 3atoxicity 3aultraviolet radiation 3aEurope1 aBagherian, Ghadamali1 aRezaei-Vahidian, Hadi0 tEnvironmental sciences Europe.g2021 Dec., v. 33, no. 1 p.117-117dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:J000001276x2190-47077nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12302-021-00555-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02390naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002300150245006400173300001600237520116400253592002801417650002501445650002601470650001901496650002301515650001301538650001201551650001301563653002201576653001401598653001801612653001601630653001901646700001501665700002401680700002001704700001601724700002301740773011201763856008401875852000901959655001201968IND60601483920221117001014.0180706e20141201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060148392DNAL7 a10.1016/j.memsci.2014.07.0742doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOkamoto, Yoshiyuki10aNew perfluoro-dioxolane-based membranes for gas separations  ap. 412-419.  aPerfluoropolymer membranes have found commercial use because of their unique gas separation properties and chemical resistance. To date, studies of gas transport in perfluoropolymers have been limited largely to variants of the commercially available polymers, Teflon® AF, Cytop, and Hyflon® AD. Here, we describe gas transport in composite membranes fabricated from copolymers of perfluoro(2-methylene-4,5-dimethyl-1,3-dioxolane) and perfluoro(2-methylene-1,3-dioxolane). These new perfluoro copolymer membranes have superior gas separation performance compared to the commercial perfluoropolymers for a number of gas pairs, including H2/CH4, He/CH4, N2/CH4, and CO2/CH4. For example, membranes based on 57mol% perfluoro(2-methylene-1,3-dioxolane) show H2/CH4 selectivity of 130 combined with a H2 permeance of 700gpu. These values far exceed an upper bound for commercial perfluoropolymers. The transport properties of the new perfluoro membranes depend strongly on the copolymer composition with increasing amounts of the efficient packing monomer perfluoro(2-methylene-1,3-dioxolane), yielding membranes with higher size selectivity and lower permeance.  aPublisher supplied data 3aasymmetric membranes 3abiological resistance 3acarbon dioxide 3acomposite polymers 3ahydrogen 3amethane 3anitrogen 0aPerfluoropolymers 0aMembranes 0aGas permeance 0aSelectivity 0aTrade-off plot1 aZhang, Hao1 aMikeš, František,1 aKoike, Yasuhiro1 aHe, Zhenjie1 aMerkel, Timothy C.0 tJournal of membrane science.g2014 Dec. 01, v. 471 p.412-419dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12468x0376-73887nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.memsci.2014.07.0743Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02894naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100002300112245014900135300002000284520164200304592002801946650001601974650003701990650000802027650001402035650002202049650001102071650001402082650001102096650002202107653000902129653002602138653001202164653003702176653001202213700001802225700001702243700002102260700001802281700002302299773014102322852000902463655001202472IND60560103920221118195233.0161221e20161221xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056010392DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAldosari, Haila
M.10aImpact of Premetallization Surface Preparation on Nickel-based Ohmic Contacts to Germanium Telluride: An X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopic Study  ap. 34802-34809.  aSurfaces of polycrystalline α-GeTe films were studied by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) after different treatments in an effort to understand the effect of premetallization surface treatments on the resistance of Ni-based contacts to GeTe. UV–O₃ is often used to remove organic contaminants after lithography and prior to metallization; therefore, UV–O₃ treatment was used first for 10 min prior to ex situ treatments, which led to oxidation of both Ge and Te to GeOₓ (x < 2) and TeO₂, respectively. Then the oxides were removed by deionized (DI) H₂O, (NH₄)₂S, and HCl treatments. Additionally, in situ Ar⁺ ion etching was used to clean the GeTe surface without prior UV–O₃ treatment. Ar⁺ ion etching, H₂O, and (NH₄)₂S treatments create a surface richer in Ge compared to the HCl treatment, after which the surface is Te-rich. However, (NH₄)₂S also oxidizes Ge and gradually etches the GeTe film. All treated surfaces showed poor stability upon prolonged exposure to air, revealing that even (NH₄)₂S does not passivate the GeTe surface. The refined transfer length method (RTLM) was used to measure the contact resistance (Rc) of as-deposited Ni-based contacts to GeTe as a function of premetallization surface preparation. HCl-treated samples had the highest Rc (0.036 ± 0.002 Ω·mm), which was more than twice that of the other surface treatments. This increase in Rc is attributed to formation of the Ni₁.₂₉Te phase at the Ni/GeTe interface due to an abundance of Te at the surface after HCl treatment.

To do this, a novel two-stage decision making model is exploited in which at the first stage the MGs construction is formed by optimal dynamic planning of hybrid DERs simultaneously with section switch allocation considering a reliability criterion for MGs as loss of load expectation (LOLE) constraint. Subsequently, at the next stage the critical energy peak pricing-based program accomplishes in order to flatten the load profile as well as diminishing the investment costs of MGs. Besides, owing to the unpredictable nature pertaining to renewable power production, the uncertainty modeling is inevitable where in this paper, a novel pragmatic robust optimization approach has been employed to deal with intense uncertainty of the problem. Numerical results obtained from an illustrative case study elucidate how the proposed MGs planning and utilized DRP pairing significantly increases the expected profit of system and ameliorates the reliability of end-users.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase studies 3adecision making 3aelectrical equipment 3aenergy 3aenergy resources 3amodels 3aplanning 3apower generation 3aprices 3auncertainty 0aMGs planning 0aDemand response 0aRobust optimization 0aRenewable energy1 aSalehi, Javad1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8140-83010 tEnergy.g2018 Oct. 15, v. 161 p.999-1015dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2018.07.1913Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02409naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001900145245007400164300001600238520103600254592002801290650002301318650003001341650002501371650002601396650001901422650001301441650001101454650001001465650001601475650001301491650001301504650001301517650000901530650001801539650000701557650001301564650001801577650001401595650001101609650001601620650001501636700002401651700003001675700002101705773012001726856004801846852000901894655001201903IND4450766920221123025125.0121003e201104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445076692DNAL7 a10.1007/s11274-010-0536-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPatra, Falguni10aCharacterization of mannitol producing strains of Leuconostoc species  ap. 933-939.  aMannitol is a naturally occurring low calorie sweetener, widely used in the food, pharmaceutical, medicine and chemical industries. In this study mannitol producing strains of Leuconostoc spp. (210) were isolated from a wide array of sources such as raw milk, fermented milks, fermented cereal foods, fruits, vegetables and sugar factory syrup. During initial screening, half of the population of these isolates (105) exhibited ability to produce mannitol to a variable extent. Only 11.4% isolate produced mannitol yield of above 80% (when fructose used @ 50Â g/l). Cultural and environmental factors affecting growth and mannitol production were studied for four high mannitol producing isolates. High mannitol production was favored by high temperature and high pH. Isolates had high osmotic tolerance as these could use fructose concentration as high as 100Â g/l in batch culture. Sequencing of 16S rRNA genes of the strains revealed that Ln27, Ln104 and Ln206 were Leuconostoc mesenteroides and Ln92 was Leuconostoc fallax.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLeuconostoc fallax 3aLeuconostoc mesenteroides 3acultural environment 3aenvironmental factors 3afermented milk 3afructose 3afruits 3agenes 3agrain foods 3aindustry 3amannitol 3amedicine 3amilk 3aosmotolerance 3apH 3araw milk 3aribosomal RNA 3ascreening 3asyrups 3atemperature 3avegetables1 aTomar, Sudhir Kumar1 aRajput, Yudhishthir Singh1 aSingh, Rameshwar0 tWorld journal of microbiology & biotechnology.g2011 Apr., v. 27, no. 4 p.933-939dSpringer-Verlagx0959-39937nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11274-010-0536-y  aDNAL 7aarticle03545naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001900153245009900172520181100271592002802082650001802110650001602128650001902144650001802163650002602181650001602207650001102223650002602234650001302260650001202273650001002285650001502295650001302310650001502323650001902338650001102357650001402368650001502382650001202397653001402409653001802423653001002441653001102451653002902462653002602491700002002517700002302537700002202560700001902582700001802601700002202619700002502641700002202666700002702688773011902715856008802834852000902922655001202931IND60754534920221120024351.0220606e20220601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075453492DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.1511312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLaconi, Andrea10aBeehive products as bioindicators of antimicrobial resistance contamination in the environment  aThe use of antimicrobials in agricultural, veterinary and medical practice exerts selective pressure on environmental microbiota, promoting the emergence and spread of antimicrobial resistance (AMR), a global concern for the One Health Initiative Task Force (OHITF). Honeybees have been studied as bioindicators of AMR in the environment, but little is known about beehive products like honey and pollen. The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence of AMR genes (ARGs) in beehive products and investigated their origins. Specifically, possible associations between ARGs, microbiota and other characteristics of different honey and pollen samples, including country of origin, flower type, type of commercial distribution and environmental factors, such as land use, weather and composition of the environment surrounding the beehives were investigated. We found that beehive products harboured ARGs conferring resistance to β-lactams, macrolides, (fluoro)quinolones and polymyxins. Most samples possessed resistance to multiple antimicrobial classes, with honey and pollen showing similar ARG profiles. Even if Lactobacillus and Acinetobacter genera were common in the microbial communities of both honey and pollen, Bacillus, Clostridium, and Bombella defined honey microbiota, while Pseudomonas and Vibrio were enriched in pollen. ErmB and blaTEM₋₁ co-occurred with Lactobacillus and Fructobacillus, while positive associations between β-lactams and macrolides and anthropogenic environments (i.e. industrial and commercial areas and non-irrigated arable lands) were found. Altogether, our findings suggest that ARGs in honey and pollen might originate from the honeybee foraging environment, and that the beehive products can be used as bioindicators of the AMR environmental contamination.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcinetobacter 3aClostridium 3aFructobacillus 3aLactobacillus 3aOne Health initiative 3aPseudomonas 3aVibrio 3aantibiotic resistance 3abeehives 3aflowers 3ahoney 3ahoney bees 3aland use 3amacrolides 3amicroorganisms 3apollen 3apollution 3apolymyxins 3aweather 0aHoneybees 0aBioindicators 0aHoney 0aPollen 0aAntimicrobial resistance 0aMicrobial communities1 aTolosi, Roberta1 aMughini-Gras, Lapo1 aMazzucato, Matteo1 aFerrè, Nicola1 aCarraro, Lisa1 aCardazzo, Barbara1 aCapolongo, Francesca1 aMerlanti, Roberta1 aPiccirillo, Alessandra0 tScience of the total environment.g2022 June 01, v. 823 p.151131-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.1511313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03512naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001400143245018600157300001600343520186400359592002802223650002602251650001302277650001202290650001202302650001502314650002702329650001002356650001402366650000902380650002602389650001402415650001402429651001102443653001402454653001302468653002602481653001602507653001602523700001602539700001302555700001402568700001602582700001502598700001502613700001402628700001502642700001702657700001802674700001602692773015102708856007802859852000902937655001202946IND60539534720221116183839.0190318e201501  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053953472DNAL7 a10.3168/jds.2014-80442doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVeh, K.A.10aGenotypic and phenotypic characterization of Staphylococcus aureus causing persistent and nonpersistent subclinical bovine intramammary infections during lactation or the dry period  ap. 155-168.  aStaphylococcus aureus is a significant pathogen frequently causing persistent intramammary infections (IMI) in dairy cows. We compared some genotypic and phenotypic characteristics of 285 strains collected from quarter milk samples from cows with persistent and nonpersistent subclinical IMI across Canada. Variable number of tandem repeats typing was used to infer the persistence of the same S. aureus strain in 3 consecutive quarter milk samples collected at intervals of 3 wk during lactation or before and after dry-off. All first isolates of the series were used as the representative strains from persistent IMI and were compared with nonpersistent strains for the presence of genes seg, sen, sec, and tst as well as by spa typing. Biofilm production in vitro and hld-RNAIII expression levels were also quantified. The gene seg was associated with a reduction in the likelihood of the bacteria to cause a persistent IMI during lactation. Strains persisting through the dry period produced significantly more biofilm in vitro than strains that do not persist after calving. Also, we showed that strains expressing more hld were more likely to be nonpersistent during either lactation or through the dry period. Three spa types were predominant (t529, t267, and a novel type: t13401). In the strains studied, the spa type tbl 2645 was the most frequent, and 97.0% of the strains of this spa type carried both sen and seg. Strains from the spa type tbl 2645 were less likely to cause a persistent IMI in the dry period. Most (86.7%) of the strains of the novel spa type (t13401) were negative for seg, sen, or both and produced significantly more biofilm in vitro than tbl 2645 and t267. The present study expanded our current knowledge on the genotypic and phenotypic traits of S. aureus strains recovered from persistent and nonpersistent IMI in Canada.  aPublisher supplied data 3aStaphylococcus aureus 3abacteria 3abiofilm 3acalving 3adairy cows 3adry period (lactation) 3agenes 3alactation 3amilk 3aminisatellite repeats 3apathogens 3aphenotype 3aCanada 0adairy cow 0amastitis 0aStaphylococcus aureus 0asubclinical 0apersistence1 aKlein, R.C.1 aSter, C.1 aKeefe, G.1 aLacasse, P.1 aScholl, D.1 aRoy, J.-P.1 aHaine, D.1 aDufour, S.1 aTalbot, B.G.1 aRibon, A.O.B.1 aMalouin, F.0 tJournal of dairy science.g2015 Jan., v. 98, no. 1 p.155-168dElsevier Inc.aAmerican Dairy Science AssociationwJournal:jnl45500x0022-03027nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3168/jds.2014-80443Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01652naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002000140245007200160300001800232520059700250592002800847650001600875650002700891650002300918650001300941650001500954650001100969700002200980700002301002700001901025700002201044700001901066773013401085856007401219852000901293655001201302IND60630804420221121230547.0190214e20190212xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063080442DNAL7 a10.1039/c8cc09373c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKempe, David K.12aA cyanide-bridged wheel featuring a seven-coordinate Mo(iii) center  ap. 2098-2101.  aA new cyclic molecule incorporating [Moᴵᴵᴵ(CN)₇]⁴⁻ has been characterized by single crystal X-ray methods, SQUID magnetometry and theoretical calculations.

Nitrile groups are introduced into the polymer backbone, and the substituent effect on electronic structures is studied. Different side chains are also involved to tune the interdigitation of the polymers. To probe the structural effects that contribute to the device performances, we provide insight into the thin-film microstructures and morphologies. Top-gate bottom-contact transistors fabricated under ambient conditions exhibit the impressive balanced hole and electron mobilities as high as 1.46 and 1.14 cm² V–¹ s–¹, respectively, which are among the highest values reported for ambipolar thiazole-flanked diketopyrrolopyrrole-based polymers. Additionally, this class of ambipolar polymers also shows promise for complementary-like inverters with a high gain value of 163.  aPublisher supplied data 3acomposite polymers 3amicrostructure 3asemiconductors 0athiazole 0adiketopyrrolopyrrole-based polymer 0afield-effect transistor 0abalanced mobilities 0aambipolar semiconductor1 aGao, Dong1 aHuang, Jianyao1 aMao, Zupan1 aZhang, Weifeng1 aYu, Gui0 tACS applied materials .g2016 Dec. 21, v. 8, no. 50 p.34725-34734dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle03791naa a2200673 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024004100113040001800154100001800172245016200190300001600352520169600368592002802064650002502092650000902117650001002126650001202136650001802148650001502166650001402181650001702195650001202212650001002224650001602234650003202250650001202282650002302294650001602317650006502333650006102398650000902459650001102468650000902479650001402488650002602502650006302528650003202591650001602623653001102639653001102650653002602661653001302687653001702700653001302717700001502730700001802745700001502763700001702778700002202795700002102817710004302838773012702881856008803008852000903096655001203105IND50070341120221119074702.0190318e20131101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007034112DNAL7 a240543332pmid7 a10.1016/j.prevetmed.2013.08.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchmidt, A.F.10aPrognostic factors of early metastasis and mortality in dogs with appendicular osteosarcoma after receiving surgery: An individual patient data meta-analysis  ap. 414-422.  aRecently an aggregated data meta-analysis showed that serum alkaline phosphatase (SALP) and proximal humerus location are predictors for shorter survival in canine osteosarcoma. To identify additional prognostic factors of mortality and metastasis an individual patient data meta-analysis (IPDMA) was conducted. Individual patient data from 20 studies, identified via the VSSO society, were pooled. Univariable and multivariable hazard ratios (HR) for metastasis and mortality were assessed, using stratified Cox models. The study included 1405 dogs who received surgical treatment, of which the metastasis status was measured in 1155 dogs and mortality status in 1336 dogs; median survival was 256 days. High versus normal SALP and weight (kg) were associated with an increase in hazard of metastasis [HR 1.34 (95%CI 1.07; 1.68) and HR 1.02 (per kg increase) (95%CI 1.01; 1.03)] and for mortality [HR 1.43 (95%CI 1.16; 1.77) and HR 1.02 (95%CI 1.01; 1.02)]. Distal radius tumor was associated with a lower hazard of metastasis compared to other locations: HR 0.75 (95%CI 0.58; 0.96). Proximal humerus and distal femur or proximal tibia location were related with an increased mortality: HR 1.53 (95%CI 1.26; 1.84) and HR 1.23 (95%CI 1.01; 1.49) compared to other locations. Older age (years) was associated with a higher hazard for mortality [HR 1.06 per year (95%CI 1.03; 1.09)] but not for metastasis: HR 1.03 (95%CI 0.99; 1.06). These results confirm findings from a recent aggregated data meta-analysis and (in addition) showed that tumor location, SALP, weight were prognostic factors for both mortality and metastasis. Age was a prognostic factor for mortality but not for metastasis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalkaline phosphatase 3adogs 3afemur 3ahumerus 3ameta-analysis 3ametastasis 3amortality 3aosteosarcoma 3asurgery 3atibia 2aAge Factors 2aAlkaline Phosphatasexblood 2aAnimals 2aBiomarkersxblood. 2aBody Weight 2aBone Neoplasmsxdiagnosisxmortalityxsecondaryxveterinary. 2aDog Diseasesxdiagnosisxgeneticsxmortalityxpathology. 2aDogs 2aFemale 2aMale 2aMortality 2aMultivariate Analysis 2aOsteosarcomaxdiagnosisxmortalityxsecondaryxveterinary. 2aProportional Hazards Models 2aSex Factors 0aCancer 0aCanine 0aDisease free survival 0aOncology 0aRisk factors 0aSurvival1 aNielen, M.1 aKlungel, O.H.1 aHoes, A.W.1 aBoer, A. de,1 aGroenwold, R.H.H.1 aKirpensteijn, J.2 afor the V.S.S.O.

In this study, we designed a special tubular membrane module, which can be self-adaptive according to the dynamic membrane filtration process, to gain a sustainable stable flux and enhance the backwashing effect. The comparison among different membrane modules in submerged bioreactor and the performance of the self-adaptive module in recirculated bioreactor were investigated. A pilot scale test lasting for 12 months was conducted to evaluate the long-term applicability of the self-adaptive membrane module. The results demonstrate that the self-adaptive structure had a beneficial effect on the formation and backwashing of the dynamic membrane. The formation time of dynamic membrane was much shorter than the flat module and the average turbidity of effluent was excellent. The self-adaptive membrane module had the longest stable operation time, up to 72.3h when operated in submerged bioreactor, much larger than other membrane modules. When operated in 60L/m²h in recirculated dynamic membrane bioreactor, the stable operation time reached up to 480.3h, due to the uniform flow field and effective impulse backwashing. The effluent concentrations of COD, TP, NH3-N and SS as well the turbidity in the pilot scale test were similar to or even below the values achieved in the wastewater treatment plants.  aPublisher supplied data 3aammonium nitrogen 3aartificial membranes 3achemical oxygen demand 3amembrane bioreactors 3amicrofiltration 3amunicipal wastewater 3aturbidity 3awastewater treatment 0aAAO 0aCFD 0aCOD 0aDM 0aDO 0aEPS 0aHRT 0aMBR 0aMLSS 0aNH3-N 0aPET 0aPVC 0aSF-DMBR 0aSRT 0aTMP 0aTP 0aWWTP 0aSelf-adaptive dynamic membrane 0aStable operation 0aMembrane module structure 0aMembrane fouling 0aComputational fluid dynamics1 aFu, Dafang1 aSingh, R.P.0 tJournal of membrane science.g2014 Dec. 01, v. 471 p.308-318dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12468x0376-73887nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.memsci.2014.08.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03099naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003800113040001800151100002700169245011200196300001600308520138400324592002801708650001201736650002001748650001401768650001701782650001301799650001101812650003301823650001001856650004801866650002801914650000901942650006701951650003902018650001102057650007802068650002302146650002002169650004902189651001202238651001802250653002002268653002102288653001902309653003302328700002202361773012602383856005102509852000902560655001202569IND50076442120221121025018.0140410e20130501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007644212DNAL7 a234421102pmid7 a10.1080/10934529.2013.7313532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNathanail, P.q(Paul),10aDerivation of a site-specific assessment criterion for benzo[a]pyrene in red shale at a former coking works  ap. 594-603.  aA former coking works in England is being remediated to enable its redevelopment. We have developed site specific human health risk assessment criteria (SSAC) for benzo[a]pyrene (BaP) based on detailed characterisation of red shale proposed for reuse in an area allocated for residential development. Samples of red shale were analysed using the Colon-enhanced Physiologically Based Extraction Test (CEPBET) to estimate the bioaccessibility of BaP. The results indicate that between 5% and 28% of the red shale BaP is bioaccessible. A cautious value of 50% was used in calculating an SSAC. The CLEA human health assessment model was used to calculate the SSAC and any changes to the default input parameters have been discussed and justified. Based on the fact that BaP appears to be a point-of-contact, rather than a systemic, carcinogen in animal studies, individual assessment criteria were estimated for the oral, inhalation and dermal routes of entry in-line with current UK guidance. An overall SSAC of 2.5 mg/kg for BaP in red shale for the residential with home-grown produce land use was then derived as the lowest of the three route-specific assessment criteria. This value is specific to both the site and the material being assessed. The approach adopted however can be applied on other sites and for other materials to inform detailed quantitative risk assessments.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimals 3abioavailability 3abreathing 3ahuman health 3aland use 3amodels 3aquantitative risk assessment 3ashale 2aBenzo(a)pyrenexanalysisxpharmacokinetics. 2aBiological Availability 2aCoke 2aEnvironmental Exposurexanalysisxstatistics & numerical data. 2aExtraction and Processing Industry 2aHumans 2aIndustrial Wastexadverse effectsxanalysisxstatistics & numerical data. 2aModels, Biological 2aRisk Assessment 2aSoil Pollutantsxanalysisxpharmacokinetics. 3aEngland 0aGreat Britain 0aBioavailability 0abioaccessibility 0abenzo[a]pyrene 0ahuman health risk assessment1 aOgden, Richard C.0 tJournal of environmental science and health.g2013 May 1, v. 48, no. 6 p.594-603dTaylor & Francis Groupx1532-41177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10934529.2013.731353  aDNAL 7aarticle01142naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100002500112245004000137300001400177520038100191592002800572650001200600650001300612650002200625650002000647650001500667650001700682650001500699700002700714773010200741852000900843655001200852IND60612376020221121170107.0180905e199403  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061237602DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aANDERSON, JOHN J.

For mosquito-borne flavi- and alphaviruses, VT is commonly viewed as rare; however, both field and experimental studies report on vertical transmission efficiency to a notably varying degree. It is likely that this reflects the different experimental methods used to test vertical transmission efficiency as well as differences between virus–vector combinations. There are very few investigations of the VT of an alphavirus in a Culex vector. Sindbis virus (SINV) is an arthritogenic alphavirus that utilizes Culex species as main vectors both in the summer transmission season and for its persistence over the winter period in northern latitudes. In this study, we investigated the vertical transmission of the SINV in Culex vectors, both in the field and in experimental settings. The detection of SINV RNA in field-collected egg rafts and emerging adults shows that vertical transmission takes place in the field. Experimentally infected females gave rise to adult offspring containing SINV RNA at emergence; however, three to four weeks after emergence none of the offspring contained SINV RNA. This study shows that vertical transmission may be connected to SINV’s ability to persist throughout northern winters and also highlights many aspects of viral replication that need further study.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCulex 3aRNA 3aSindbis virus 3aadults 3aarthropods 3aeggs 3apathogens 3aprogeny 3asummer 3avirus replication1 aÖborn, Linnea 1 aSjöberg, Viktoria 1 aLundkvist, Åke 1 aHesson, Jenny C.0 tViruses.g2022 Aug. 30, v. 14, no. 9dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27138x1999-49157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/v140919153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02466naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001900145245009900164300001800263500001100281520085800292592002801150596006601178650001401244650001601258650001601274650001201290650001301302650002001315650000701335650002001342650001401362650002001376650002201396650001601418650001401434650001601448650002201464650001101486700002701497700001701524700002301541700002301564700003101587700002201618700002501640700003401665700002001699773011601719856008001835852000901915655001201924IND60786811720221118212515.0220806e201707  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078681172DNAL7 a10.1002/1873-3468.126732doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMahmoud, Shima10aTOR complex 1 regulates the yeast plasma membrane proton pump and pH and potassium homeostasis  ap. 1993-2002.  aLETTER  aWe have identified in yeast a connection between two master regulators of cell growth: a biochemical connection involving the TORC1 protein kinase (which activates protein synthesis, nutrient uptake, and anabolism) and a biophysical connection involving the plasma membrane proton‐pumping H⁺‐ATPase Pma1 (which drives nutrient and K⁺ uptake and regulates pH homeostasis). Raising the temperature to nonpermissive values in a TOR thermosensitive mutant decreases Pma1 activity. Rapamycin, a TORC1 inhibitor, inhibits Pma1 dependent on its receptor Fpr1 and on the protein phosphatase Sit4, a TORC1 effector.

Greater knowledge of the effects of stress on aggregation can help avoid undesirable conformational and colloidal instabilities. With this in mind we investigated five marketed therapeutic monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) namely bebacizumab (BVZ), cetuximab (CTX), infliximab (IFX), rituximab (RTX) and tratuzumab (TTZ) in their innovative medicines. These were submitted to different controlled stresses, to freeze/thaw cycles and used for long-term stability studies once the vials were opened. Aggregate formation was tracked by analyzing the mAbs chromatographic profiles by size-exclusion liquid chromatography coupled with diode array detection. Results indicated that the tendency to aggregate depends on the particular stress conditions and on the concentration and nature of the mAb, even though all share similar IgG1-structure. Fragmentation of the mAb produced by the stress was probably due to the rupture of cystines between the two heavy chains. Regarding stability study, BVZ, RTX and TTZ proved to be the most stable when stored at 4 °C and in freeze/thaw cycles with no tendency to form aggregates. INF tends to form aggregates at 0.5 mg/mL, while in CTX, the most unstable, degradation was detected.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiopharmaceuticals 3adiodes 3aliquid chromatography 3amedicine 3amonoclonal antibodies 3astorage temperature 3atherapeutics 0aProtein aggregation 0aSize exclusion chromatography 0aTherapeutic monoclonal antibodies1 aMartínez-Ortega, Antonio1 aSalmerón-García, Antonio1 aCabeza San Deogracias, José,1 aPrados, José Carlos1 aOrtiz, Raul,1 aNavas, Natalia0 tInternational journal of biological macromolecules.g2018 Oct. 15, v. 118 p.511-524dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12340x0141-81307nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2018.06.1053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02927naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245009100168300001100259520155000270592002801820596007701848650001201925650001401937650001601951650001701967650001801984650002302002650001602025650002302041650002402064650002602088650001502114650001202129650001102141650001102152700002402163700001902187700002002206700005902226773010402285856008302389852000902472655001202481IND60753282520221121211658.0211221e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075328252DNAL7 a10.1186/s12896-021-00715-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRapp, Christian10aReductive enzymatic dynamic kinetic resolution affording 115 g/L (S)-2-phenylpropanol  ap. 58.  aBACKGROUND: Published biocatalytic routes for accessing enantiopure 2-phenylpropanol using oxidoreductases afforded maximal product titers of only 80 mM. Enzyme deactivation was identified as the major limitation and was attributed to adduct formation of the aldehyde substrate with amino acid residues of the reductase. RESULTS: A single point mutant of Candida tenuis xylose reductase (CtXR D51A) with very high catalytic efficiency (43·10³ s⁻¹ M⁻¹) for (S)-2-phenylpropanal was found. The enzyme showed high enantioselectivity for the (S)-enantiomer but was deactivated by 0.5 mM substrate within 2 h. A whole-cell biocatalyst expressing the engineered reductase and a yeast formate dehydrogenase for NADH-recycling provided substantial stabilization of the reductase. The relatively slow in situ racemization of 2-phenylpropanal and the still limited biocatalyst stability required a subtle adjustment of the substrate-to-catalyst ratio. A value of 3.4 gₛᵤbₛₜᵣₐₜₑ/gcₑₗₗ₋dᵣy₋wₑᵢgₕₜ was selected as a suitable compromise between product ee and the conversion ratio. A catalyst loading of 40 gcₑₗₗ₋dᵣy₋wₑᵢgₕₜ was used to convert 1 M racemic 2-phenylpropanal into 843 mM (115 g/L) (S)-phenylpropanol with 93.1% ee. CONCLUSION: The current industrial production of profenols mainly relies on hydrolases. The bioreduction route established here represents an alternative method for the production of profenols that is competitive with hydrolase-catalyzed kinetic resolutions.  aPublisher supplied data  aACIB Komet K2 CentercÖsterreichische Forschungsförderungsgesellschaft 3aCandida 3aaldehydes 3aamino acids 3abiocatalysts 3abiotechnology 3acatalytic activity 3aenantiomers 3aenantioselectivity 3aenzyme inactivation 3aformate dehydrogenase 3ahydrolases 3amutants 3axylose 3ayeasts1 aPival-Marko, Simone1 aTassano, Erika1 aNidetzky, Bernd1 aKratzer, Regina1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9318-12470 tBMC biotechnology.g2021 Dec., v. 21, no. 1 p.58-58dBioMed CentralwJournal:19124x1472-67507nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12896-021-00715-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02973naa a2200625 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001900164245014700183300001800330520100200348592002801350650001301378650001901391650001301410650001201423650001501435650001701450650002301467650002501490650002301515650002101538650001701559650001801576650002201594650001301616650000901629650003201638650002401670650004101694650004101735650004101776650002801817650003401845650002701879650006601906650004601972650001402018700001402032700001502046700001602061700001502077700001402092700002002106700001802126700001902144773011502163856004802278852000902326655001202335IND4449117320221121192832.0121003e201103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444911732DNAL7 a209536022pmid7 a10.1007/s00253-010-2927-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLuo, Shenglian10aIsolation and characterization of endophytic bacterium LRE07 from cadmium hyperaccumulator Solanum nigrum L. and its potential for remediation  ap. 1637-1644.  aValuable endophytic strains facilitating plants growth and detoxification of heavy metals are required because the application of plant–endophyte symbiotic system is a promising potential technique to improve efficiency of phytoremediation. In this study, endophytic bacterium LRE07 was isolated from cadmium hyperaccumulator Solanum nigrum L. It was identified as Serratia sp. by 16S rRNA sequence analysis. The endophytic bacterium LRE07 was resistant to the toxic effects of heavy metals, solubilized mineral phosphate, and produced indoleacetic acid and siderophore. The heavy metal detoxification was studied in growing LRE07 cells. The strain bound over 65% of cadmium and 35% of zinc in its growing cells from single metal solutions 72 h after inoculation. Besides the high removal efficiencies in single-ion system, an analogous removal phenomenon was also observed in multi-ions system, indicating that the endophyte possesses specific and remarkable heavy metal remediation abilities.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSerratia 3aSolanum nigrum 3abacteria 3acadmium 3aendophytes 3aheavy metals 3aindole acetic acid 3anucleotide sequences 3aphosphate minerals 3aphytoremediation 3aplant growth 3aribosomal RNA 3asequence analysis 3atoxicity 3azinc 2aBacterial Typing Techniques 2aCadmiumxmetabolism 2aDNA, Bacterialxchemistryxgenetics. 2aDNA, Ribosomalxchemistryxgenetics. 2aEnvironmental Pollutantsxmetabolism 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aRNA, Ribosomal, 16Sxgenetics 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 2aSerratiaxclassificationxgeneticsxisolation & purification. 2aSolanum nigrumxmicrobiologyxphysiology. 2aSymbiosis1 aWan, Yong1 aXiao, Xiao1 aGuo, Hanjun1 aMa, Yukun,1 aXi, Qiang1 aZeng, Guangming1 aLiu, Chengbin1 aChen, Jueliang0 tApplied microbiology and biotechnology.g2011 Mar., v. 89, no. 5 p.1637-1644dSpringer-Verlagx0175-75987nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00253-010-2927-2  aDNAL 7aarticle03797naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002500153245010000178520219500278592002802473650002602501650002702527650002302554650001202577650001602589650001702605650002602622650002002648650001402668650001602682650001502698650001602713650001902729650002002748650001802768650001802786650001302804653001402817653001602831653002102847653002202868653001602890653003402906700001702940700002102957700001702978700002402995700002003019773011903039856008803158852000903246655001203255IND60754535320221123040439.0220118e20220225xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075453532DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.1511382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAdejimi, Olubunmi E.10aLow-Resolution Raman Spectroscopy for the detection of contaminant species in algal bioreactors  aFouling of aquatic systems by harmful microalgal and cyanobacterial species is an environmental and public health concern. Microalgal bioreactors are engineered ecosystems for the cultivation of algal biomass to meet the increasing demand for alternative protein sources and algae-derived products. Such bioreactors are often open or semi-open ponds or raceways that are prone to contamination by contaminant photosynthetic microorganisms, including harmful cyanobacterial species (HCBs). HCBs affect the quality of products through the accumulation of off-flavours, reducing their acceptance by consumers, and through the production of several different toxins collectively known as cyanotoxins. The density of cultured species within the bioreactor environment creates difficulty in detecting low concentrations of contaminant cells, and there is currently no technology enabling rapid monitoring of contaminations. The present study demonstrates the potential of Low-Resolution Raman Spectroscopy (LRRS) as a tool for rapid detection of low concentrations of HCBs within dense populations of the spirulina (Arthrospira platensis) cultures. An LRRS system adapted for the direct measurement of raw biomass samples was used to assemble a database of Raman spectral signatures, from eight algal and cyanobacterial strains. This dataset was used to develop both quantitative and discriminative chemometric models. The results obtained from the chemometric analyses demonstrate the ability of the LRRS to detect and quantify algal and cyanobacterial species at concentrations as low as 10³ cells/mL and to robustly discriminate between species at concentrations of 10⁴ cells/mL. The LRRS and chemometric analyses were further able to detect the presence of low concentrations (10³cells/mL) of contaminating species, including the toxic cyanobacterium Microcystis aeruginosa, within dense (>10⁷ cells/mL) spirulina cultures. The results presented provide a first demonstration of the potential of LRRS technology for real-time detection of contaminant species within microalgal bioreactors, and possibly for early detection of developing harmful algal blooms in other aquatic ecosystems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArthrospira platensis 3aMicrocystis aeruginosa 3aRaman spectroscopy 3abiomass 3abioreactors 3achemometrics 3acyanobacterial toxins 3adata collection 3adatabases 3aenvironment 3amicroalgae 3aoff flavors 3aphotosynthesis 3apoisonous algae 3apublic health 3arapid methods 3atoxicity 0aSpirulina 0aMicrocystis 0aMachine learning 0aAlgal bioreactors 0aFood safety 0aHarmful cyanobacterial blooms1 aIgnat, Timea1 aSadhasivam, Giji1 aZakin, Varda1 aSchmilovitch, Ze'ev1 aShapiro, Orr H.0 tScience of the total environment.g2022 Feb. 25, v. 809 p.151138-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.1511383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02375naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100001600112245015600128300002000284520110600304592002801410650001501438650002301453650001301476650001301489650001901502650001701521650002501538650001501563650001301578650001001591650001301601653002901614653002501643653001301668653004201681653005101723700001701774700001401791700001301805773012601818852000901944655001201953IND60560104420221118194336.0161221e20161221xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056010442DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang1, Dong10aSpace-Confined Growth of Defect-Rich Molybdenum Disulfide Nanosheets Within Graphene: Application in The Removal of Smoke Particles and Toxic Volatiles  ap. 34735-34743.  aIn this work, molybdenum disulfide/reduced graphene oxide (MoS₂/RGO) hybrids are synthesized by a spatially confined reaction to insert the growth of defect-rich MoS₂ nanosheets within graphene to enable incorporation into the polymer matrix for the application in the removal of smoke particles and toxic volatiles. The steady-state tube furnace result demonstrates that MoS₂/RGO hybrid could considerably reduce the yield of CO and smoke particles. The TG-IR coupling technique was utilized to identify species of toxic volatiles including aromatic compounds, CO, and hydrocarbons and to investigate the removal effect of MoS₂/RGO hybrids on reducing toxic volatiles. The removal of smoke particles and toxic volatiles was attributed to the adsorption capacity derived from edges sites of MoS₂ and the honeycomb lattice of graphene, as well as the inhibition of nanobarrier resulting from two-dimensional structure.

The avirulence (AVR) genes in M. oryzae are required to initiate robust disease resistance mediated by the corresponding resistance (R) genes in rice. Therefore, monitoring pathogen AVR genes is important to predict the stability of R gene-mediated blast resistance. In the present study, we analyzed the DNA sequence dynamics of five AVR genes, namely, AVR-Pita1, AVR-Pik, AVR-Pizt, AVR-Pia, and AVR-Pii, in field isolates of M. oryzae in order to understand the effectiveness of the R genes, Pi-ta, Pi-k, Pi-zt, Pia, and Pii in the Southern U.S. rice growing region. Genomic DNA of 258 blast isolates collected from commercial fields of the Southern UNITED STATES during 1975–2009 were subjected to PCR amplification with AVR gene-specific PCR markers. PCR products were obtained from 232 isolates. The absence of PCR products in the remaining 26 isolates suggests that these isolates do not contain the tested AVR genes. Amplified PCR products were subsequently gel purified and sequenced. Based on the presence or absence of the five AVR genes, 232 field isolates were classified into 10 haplotype groups. The results revealed that 174 isolates of M. oryzae carried AVR-Pita1, 225 isolates carried AVR-Pizt, 44 isolates carried AVR-Pik, 3 isolates carried AVR-Pia, and one isolate carried AVR-Pii. AVR-Pita1 was highly variable, and 40 AVR-Pita1 haplotypes were identified in avirulent isolates. AVR-Pik had four nucleotide sequence site changes resulting in amino acid substitutions, whereas three other AVR genes, AVR-Pizt, AVR-Pia, and AVR-Pii, were relatively stable. Two AVR genes, AVR-Pik and AVR-Pizt, were found to exist in relatively larger proportions of the tested field isolates, which suggested that their corresponding R genes Pi-k and Pi-zt can be deployed in preventing blast disease in the Southern UNITED STATES in addition to Pi-ta. This study demonstrates that continued AVR gene monitoring in the pathogen population is critical for ensuring the effectiveness of deployed blast R genes in commercial rice fields.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aMagnaporthe oryzae 3aOryza sativa 3aamino acid substitution 3aavirulent strains 3ablast disease 3adisease resistance 3agels 3agenes 3ahaplotypes 3amonitoring 3anucleotide sequences 3apaddies 3apathogens 3apolymerase chain reaction 3arapid methods 3arice 3asurveys 3aSoutheastern United States 0arice blast 0afield isolates 0aavirulence gene 0asouthern United States1 aJia, Yulin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2132-04981 aWang, Yanli1 aSun, Guochang0 tPlant disease.g2020 Mar., v. 104, no. 3 p.717-723dPlant DiseasewJournal:jnl30858x0191-29177nnas40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/68545883Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1094/PDIS-08-19-1688-RE3Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle01655naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245011900158300001800277520048500295592002800780650002600808650001400834650002300848650002700871650002600898650002600924650001700950700001500967700001600982700001600998700001901014700001201033700001901045773013401064856007401198852000901272655001201281IND60630804720221121230640.0190214e20190212xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063080472DNAL7 a10.1039/c8cc09491h2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Yingmu12aA mesoporous NNN-pincer-based metal–organic framework scaffold for the preparation of noble-metal-free catalysts  ap. 2023-2026.  aThrough topology-guided synthesis, a Zr-based mesoporous MOF was successfully constructed, adopting a β-cristobalite-type structure.

The majority of SARS-CoV-2 sequences published are from Europe, North America, and Asia. Between April 2020 and January 2022, 795 SARS-CoV-2-positive nares swabs from individuals in the U.S. Navy installation Camp Lemonnier, Djibouti, were collected, sequenced, and analyzed. In this study, we described the results of genomic sequencing and analysis for 589 samples, the first published viral sequences for Djibouti, including 196 cases of vaccine breakthrough infections. This study contributes to the knowledge base of circulating SARS-CoV-2 lineages in the under-sampled country of Djibouti, where only 716 total genome sequences are available at time of publication. Our analysis resulted in the detection of circulating variants of concern, mutations of interest in lineages in which those mutations are not common, and emerging spike mutations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 3adisease surveillance 3agenome 3agenomics 3ainfectious diseases 3apandemic 3apathogens 3avaccines 3aAsia 3aDjibouti 3aEurope 3aNorth America1 aVoegtly, Logan J.1 aStefanov, Emily K.1 aLueder, Matthew R.1 aLuquette, Andrea E.1 aMiller, Robin H.1 aMiner, Haven L.1 aBennett, Andrew J.1 aGlang, Lindsay 1 aMcGinnis, Tara N.1 aReisinger, Kristie E.1 aDugan, Jae W.1 aMangat, Michael A.1 aSilberger, Daniel J.1 aPavlicek, Rebecca L.1 aWatters, Chaselynn M.1 aRice, Gregory K.1 aMalagon, Francisco 1 aCer, Regina Z.1 aEggan, Stephen M.1 aBishop-Lilly, Kimberly A.0 tViruses.g2022 Aug. 30, v. 14, no. 9dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27138x1999-49157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/v140919183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04408naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001900143245013400162300001600296520269400312592002803006650001303034650001103047650001603058650001503074650001503089650002003104650002203124650001903146650002203165650001803187650001403205650001403219650001803233650000903251650001203260650000903272650001503281650001203296650002003308650001703328650001303345650001303358650001503371653001103386653001303397653001503410653002003425653002503445700001503470700002003485700002003505700001303525700001803538773015103556856007803707852000903785655001203794IND60539535020221116184017.0190318e201501  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053953502DNAL7 a10.3168/jds.2014-85322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKristensen, T.10aFeeding, production, and efficiency of Holstein-Friesian, Jersey, and mixed-breed lactating dairy cows in commercial Danish herds  ap. 263-274.  aThe objective of this paper was to compare efficiency measures, milk production, and feed intake for lactating cows in commercial herds using different breeds and production and milking systems. To accomplish this, we used all feed evaluations made by the Danish extension service during the period November 2012 to April 2013 for 779 herds, of which 508 were Holstein-Friesian (HOL); 100 were Jersey (JER); and 171 herds were a mixture of these 2 breeds, other dairy breeds, and crossbreeds (OTH). The annually recorded, herd-average energy-corrected milk (ECM) yield was 8,716kg (JER) and 9,606kg (HOL); and average herd size was 197 cows (HOL) and 224 cows (JER). All cows were fed a total mixed or partial mixed ration supplemented with concentrate from feeding stations, housed in loose housing systems with a slatted floor, and milked in either a parlor milking unit or an automatic milking system. Energy efficiency was calculated as net energy efficiency defined as total energy demand as a percentage of energy intake and as residual feed intake defined as energy intake (net energy for lactation; NEL) minus energy requirement. Production efficiency was expressed as kilograms of ECM per kilogram of dry matter intake (DMI), kilograms of ECM per 10 MJ of net energy intake (NEL), kilograms of ECM per 100kg of BW, and kilograms of DMI per 100kg of BW. Environmental efficiency was expressed by the nitrogen efficiency calculated as N in milk and meat as a percentage of N in intake, and as enteric emission of methane expressed as kilograms of ECM per megajoule of CH4. Mean milk yield for lactating cows was 30.4kg of ECM in HOL and 3kg less in JER, with OTH herds in between. Mean NEL intake was 122 MJ in JER, increasing to 147 MJ in HOL, whereas ration energy density between breeds did not differ (6.4–6.5 MJ of NEL per kg of DMI). The NEL intake and DMI explained 56 and 47%, respectively, of variation in production (ECM) for HOL herds but only 44 and 27% for JER. Jersey had a higher efficiency than HOL and OTH, except in nitrogen efficiency, where no significant difference between breeds existed. Most of the efficiency measures were internally significantly correlated and in general highly positively correlated with milk production, whereas the correlation to DMI was less positive and for JER negative for net energy efficiency, kilograms of ECM per kilogram of DMI, and nitrogen efficiency. Only little of the variation in efficiency between herds could be explained by differences in nutrient or roughage content of DMI. This could be explained by the fact that data were collected from herds purchasing feed planning and evaluation from the extension service.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHolstein 3aJersey 3acorrelation 3acrossbreds 3adairy cows 3adata collection 3adry matter intake 3aenergy density 3aenergy efficiency 3aenergy intake 3aherd size 3alactation 3aloose housing 3ameat 3amethane 3amilk 3amilk yield 3amilking 3amilking parlors 3amixed breeds 3anitrogen 3aplanning 3apurchasing 0aJersey 0aHolstein 0aefficiency 0acommercial herd 0aenvironmental impact1 aJensen, C.1 aØstergaard, S.1 aWeisbjerg, M.R.1 aAaes, O.1 aNielsen, N.I.0 tJournal of dairy science.g2015 Jan., v. 98, no. 1 p.263-274dElsevier Inc.aAmerican Dairy Science AssociationwJournal:jnl45500x0022-03027nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3168/jds.2014-85323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02481naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001700146245009600163300001800259520095300277592002801230650001601258650001901274650001501293650001401308650002301322650002801345650001301373650001201386650001701398650001401415650001401429650002001443650002401463650001401487700001401501700001701515700001601532700001701548700001601565700001801581700001901599700005601618700005301674773017101727856008001898852000901978655001201987IND60691389720221119215129.0200429e20200406xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069138972DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.iecr.0c007782doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Qingshuo10aHighly Efficient Solvent-free Conversion of CO₂ into Cyclic Carbonates by Acrylamide–KI  ap. 8136-8144.  aThe cycloaddition of CO₂ with epoxide has been a promising way to fix CO₂. Developing efficient, low-cost catalysts for this reaction is highly desired. In this paper, we report a novel cocatalyst system that consists of acrylamide and KI for the synthesis of propylene carbonate using CO₂ and propylene oxide as starting materials. Different amides (i.e., acrylamide, benzamide, nicotinamide, acetamide, N-isopropylacrylamide, N-tert-butylacrylamide, and N,N-dimethylacrylamide) were combined with different potassium halides to investigate their catalysis capability. KI/acrylamide showed the highest efficiency, and a synergetic effect occurred between acrylamide and KI. At the KI: acrylamide ratio of 1:1 (mol/mol) and concentration of 2.5 mol% for both of them (based on PO), the reaction reached a yield of 95.3%. The catalytic system applies to the cycloaddition reaction using different epoxides.

Specifically, membranes with average pore opening of 1.5µm, 2.5µm, 2.8µm and 3.4µm and tubular pore cross-sections were prepared. Different solvent systems, dilutions and casting conditions were tested to realize BF templating for fabrication of microporous membranes with controlled and uniform pore sizes. PSF dissolved in a solvent-nonsolvent pair of dichloromethane and tertiary amyl alcohol at 6–10% (w/v) concentration cast at 85–95% relative humidity and 30°C resulted in microporous membranes with uniform monodispersed, nearly hexagonally packed pore openings. The cross-sections revealed tubular channels or macrovoids followed by closed or interconnected cellular structure formed due to phase separation. In absence of internal nonsolvent BF templating could occur only in very dilute solution. The work also underscores need for immiscibility of casting solvents with water.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalcohols 3acell structures 3amethylene chloride 3amicroporous membranes 3aporosity 3arelative humidity 3aseparation 3asolvents 0aBreath figure templating 0aMicroporous membranes 0aHighly ordered porosity 0aPhase-separation1 aPandey, Pratibha0 tJournal of membrane science.g2014 Dec. 01, v. 471 p.201-210dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12468x0376-73887nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.memsci.2014.08.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02885naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100006400145245008400209300001600293500002000309520157900329592002801908596002701936596005701963596005702020596005702077596005702134596005702191650001002248650001002258650001402268650001302282650001702295773012202312856008002434852000902514655001202523IND60788590220221120050609.0220815e202103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078859022DNAL7 a10.1111/1440-1703.122002doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSuzuki, Toshitaka N.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6405-765310aAnimal linguistics: Exploring referentiality and compositionality in bird calls  ap. 221-231.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aEstablishing the theory of language evolution is an ongoing challenge in science. One profitable approach in this regard is to seek the origins of linguistic capabilities by comparing language with the vocal communication systems of closely related relatives (i.e., the great apes). However, several key capabilities of language appear to be absent in non‐human primates, which limits the range of studies, such as direct phylogenetic comparison. A further informative approach lies in identifying convergent features in phylogenetically distant animals and conducting comparative studies. This approach is particularly useful with respect to establishing general rules for the evolution of linguistic capabilities. In this article, I review recent findings on linguistic capabilities in a passerine bird species, the Japanese tit (Parus minor). Field experiments have revealed that Japanese tits produce unique alarm calls when encountering predatory snakes, which serve to enhance the visual attention of call receivers with respect to snake‐like objects. Moreover, tits often combine discrete types of meaningful calls into fixed‐ordered sequences according to an ordering rule, conveying a compositional message to receivers. These findings indicate that two core capabilities of language, namely, referentiality and compositionality, have independently evolved in the avian lineage. I describe how these linguistic capabilities can be examined under field conditions and discuss how such research may contribute to exploring the origins and evolution of language.  aPublisher supplied data  cHakubi Project funding  a16K18616cJapan Society for the Promotion of Science  a18H05074cJapan Society for the Promotion of Science  a18K14789cJapan Society for the Promotion of Science  a20H03325cJapan Society for the Promotion of Science  a20H05001cJapan Society for the Promotion of Science 3aParus 3abirds 3aphylogeny 3aresearch 3avocalization0 tEcological research.g2021 Mar., v. 36, no. 2 p.221-231dJohn Wiley & Sons, Inc.wJournal:jnl3870047x0912-38147nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1440-1703.122003Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02279naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001500152245012500167300001600292520097800308592002801286650001601314650001601330650002201346650002101368650001501389650001101404650000901415650001601424650001101440650001901451650002001470650001901490653001101509653002101520653002001541653002001561700001501581700001801596773013501614856008701749852000901836655001201845IND60601838620221123024614.0201202e20181015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060183862DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2018.06.0882doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYu, Boming10aIron oxide/lignin-based hollow carbon nanofibers nanocomposite as an application electrode materials for supercapacitors  ap. 478-484.  aIron oxide particle-decorated, hollow, carbon nanofibers (HCNFs), with poly(styrene-co-acrylonitrile) solution as the core and acetic acid lignin as the shell, were manufactured using a coaxial electrospinning technique, using iron(III) acetylacetonate as the iron oxide-precursor additive in the shell. The fabricated HCNFs exhibited a high specific capacitance of 121 F·g⁻¹ at 0.5 A·g⁻¹, which was 2.18-fold that of solid electrospun nanofibers under the same conditions. The samples also possessed a superior cycling life, with a 90% retention rate after 1000 cycles in 1 M sodium sulfite. In this system, HCNFs exhibited high surface areas, as the result of hollow structures and producing capacitance improvement, while iron oxide particles enhanced electrochemical properties via reversible redox reactions. The attractive performances exhibited by these supercapacitors yielded them potentially promising candidates for future energy storage systems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetic acid 3acapacitance 3acarbon nanofibers 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3aenergy 3airon 3airon oxides 3alignin 3ananocomposites 3aredox reactions 3asodium sulfite 0aLignin 0aCarbon nanofiber 0aElectrospinning 0aElectrochemical1 aGele, Aori1 aWang, Linping0 tInternational journal of biological macromolecules.g2018 Oct. 15, v. 118 p.478-484dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12340x0141-81307nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2018.06.0883Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02603naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002800145245011200173300001800285500001100303520095200314592002801266596007301294596006501367596004001432596004401472596004501516596004401561596006601605650002301671650001601694650001001710650001301720650002001733650001101753700001701764700002501781700001901806700001701825700001701842700005601859700001301915773011601928856008002044852000902124655001202133IND60786812020221118212610.0220806e201707  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078681202DNAL7 a10.1002/1873-3468.127072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJensen, Kristopher Torp10aChromatin accessibility and guide sequence secondary structure affect CRISPR‐Cas9 gene editing efficiency  ap. 1892-1901.  aLETTER  aClustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR)‐associated protein 9 (CRISPR‐Cas9) systems have emerged as the method of choice for genome editing, but large variations in on‐target efficiencies continue to limit their applicability. Here, we investigate the effect of chromatin accessibility on Cas9‐mediated gene editing efficiency for 20 gRNAs targeting 10 genomic loci in HEK293T cells using both SpCas9 and the eSpCas9(1.1) variant. Our study indicates that gene editing is more efficient in euchromatin than in heterochromatin, and we validate this finding in HeLa cells and in human fibroblasts. Furthermore, we investigate the gRNA sequence determinants of CRISPR‐Cas9 activity using a surrogate reporter system and find that the efficiency of Cas9‐mediated gene editing is dependent on guide sequence secondary structure formation. This knowledge can aid in the further improvement of tools for gRNA design.  aPublisher supplied data  aDFF‐1337‐00128cDanish Research Council for Independent Research  aDFF‐1335‐00763AcSapere Aude Young Research Talent Prize  cInnovation Fund Denmark (BrainStem)  aR173‐2014‐1105cLundbeck Foundation  aR151‐2013‐14439cLundbeck Foundation  aR219‐2016‐1375cLundbeck Foundation  aCXZZ20150330171838997cShenzhen Municipal Government of China 3aCRISPR-Cas systems 3afibroblasts 3agenes 3agenomics 3aheterochromatin 3ahumans1 aFløe, Lasse1 aPetersen, Trine Skov1 aHuang, Jinrong1 aXu, Fengping1 aBolund, Lars1 aLuo, Yonglun1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0007-77591 aLin, Lin0 tFEBS letters.g2017 July, v. 591, no. 13 p.1892-1901dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl16404x0014-57937nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/1873-3468.127073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02682naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002700151245012200178300001600300520102500316536018201341592002801523596001901551596002301570596001901593596002301612650001501635650001401650650001201664650002101676650002601697650001401723650001301737650000701750653003501757653002301792653002701815653002301842700002801865700003601893700002801929700002501957773013501982856008602117852000902203655001202212IND60778647720221123041508.0220530e20220517xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077864772DNAL7 a10.1080/10934529.2022.20501242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchmidt, Lucia Natasha10aGels based on calcium alginate/pillared bentonite: structural characterization and their use as cadmium removal agent  ap. 218-228.  aIn this work, calcium alginate hydrogels with natural and pillared bentonites (0.5 and 5% w/w) were synthetized in two geometries (disks and beads) and their capacity to adsorb cadmium ion from aqueous media was evaluated. Pillarization effect on bentonite morphology was evidenced by SEM, XRD, LD and BET isotherms. Structure and swelling capacity of hydrogels were determined, showing that hydrogels beads with pillared clays presented the higher ability to retain water. Regarding cadmium adsorption capacity, the effect of pH media (3, 5 and 7), the contact time (0 to 320 min.) and the initial cadmium ion concentration (6 to 42 mg/L) were studied employing hydrogel beads. Regardless bentonite type and concentration, the optimal pH cadmium adsorption was 7, reaching the highest adsorption capacity (93%) for hydrogel with 0.5% natural bentonite. Besides, the equilibrium adsorption time was reached at 120 min for all studied hydrogels and experimental data fitted with a pseudo-second order kinetic model.  aFondo para la Investigación Científica y Tecnológica (FONCyT, Argentina) Grant PICT-2016-0181.

The water quality assessment is important implementing the monitoring and remediation programs to minimize the risk of hazardous substances in freshwaters. Thus, this study evaluated the surface water quality of a stretch of the Bois River (Brazil), based on the physicochemical, microbiological and ecotoxicological analyses conducted in 2017, using Standard Methods and fish embryo acute toxicity (FET) test with zebrafish (Danio rerio). The results indicated that the quality of water samples located close to the discharge of tannery effluents was most impaired. Total phosphorus, BOD, DO, ammoniacal nitrogen, and thermotolerant coliforms parameters in P4 were not in accordance with the standards of current Brazilian legislation. Iron, lead, and copper levels were higher than environmental standards. The physicochemical quality of water samples was lower in the dry season than the rainy season. All samples (P1, P3, and P5) in rainy and dry seasons did not induce significant acute toxicity for zebrafish early-life stage; however other trophic levels (algae and microcrustacean) should be investigated to gain a better understanding of the toxicity during water quality analysis. In conclusion, the physicochemical and microbiological changes in the water of the Bois River can affect aquatic organisms as well as humans when it is used for drinking or in agriculture.  aThis work was supported by the Coordination for the Improvement of Higher Education Personnel - Brazil (CAPES) under Grant 001 and; National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq) under Grant 465571/2014-0.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDanio rerio 3aacute toxicity 3aammonium nitrogen 3adevelopmental stages 3adry season 3aecotoxicology 3afish 3aheat tolerance 3alaws and regulations 3aremediation 3arisk 3arivers 3asurface water 3atanneries 3atotal phosphorus 3awater pollution 3awater quality 3awater quality analysis 3awet season 3aBrazil 0aEffluent discharges 0atoxicity assay 0azebrafish 0aheavy metal concentrations 0aseasonality1 aCosta, Gessyca Gonçalves1 aBrito, Lara Barroso1 ade Oliveira, Gisele Augusto Rodrigues1 aScalize, Paulo Sérgio0 tJournal of environmental science and health.g2022 May 17, v. 57, no. 3 p.242-249dTaylor & FranciswJournal:2126x1532-41177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10934529.2022.20600263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02724naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245015400170300001800324520129900342592002801641650002701669650002401696650002801720650001301748650001001761650002801771650001701799650001101816650001401827650001001841650001001851650001401861653002701875653002801902653001401930653002401944700001901968700001501987700001302002700001502015700001602030773011402046856008502160852000902245655001202254IND60555879420221116233204.0161030e20161002xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055587942DNAL7 a10.1080/09583157.2016.12121862doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNanGong, ZiYan10aSynergism between Bacillus thuringiensis and Xenorhabdus nematophila against resistant and susceptible Plutella xylostella (Lepidoptera: Plutellidae)  ap. 1411-1419.  aThe diamondback moth (DBM) Plutella xylostella (L.) is one of the most destructive pests of crucifer crops in many parts of the world. Inappropriate applications have caused DBM to become resistant to most insecticides. We tested the combined effects of the bacteria Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) and Xenorhabdus nematophila (Xn) against DBM. Populations of Bt -resistant moths (DBM-R), selected repeatedly with B. thuringiensis subsp. kurstaki HD-73 (Bt HD-73), showed resistance rates of 105.43 and 0.92 for Bt HD-73 and X. nematophila HB310 (Xn HB310), respectively. These results not only indicated that DBM-R is highly resistant to Bt HD-73 and only slightly resistant to Xn HB310, but also showed that there is no interactive resistance between the two bacteria. For the third-instar larvae of DBM-R and DBM-S, no significant differences were found in the oral insecticidal activities of Bt HD-73 + Xn HB310 combination treatments or Bt HD-73 alone. However, mortality rates were significantly increased in response to Xn HB310 + Bt HD-73 when compared with the Xn HB310-alone treatment. These results demonstrate a synergism of Bt on Xn , but no such effect of Xn on Bt . Therefore, our findings highlight the potential for both bacteria to be used in a mixture for field applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillus thuringiensis 3aPlutella xylostella 3aXenorhabdus nematophila 3abacteria 3acrops 3ainsecticidal properties 3ainsecticides 3alarvae 3amortality 3amoths 3apests 3asynergism 0aBacillus thuringiensis 0aXenorhabdus nematophila 0asynergism 0aPlutella xylostella1 aWang, Qinying,1 aSong, Ping1 aHao, Jie1 aYang, Qing1 aWang, Liyu,0 tBiocontrol science and technology.g2016 Oct. 2, v. 26, no. 10 p.1411-1419dTaylor & Francisx1360-04787nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09583157.2016.12121863Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle06163naa a2200709 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100002000188245010600208300001400314500001100328506007600339520407700415592002804492506003704520650002004557650001804577650001504595650001104610650001204621650001304633650002504646650001404671650001504685650001004700650002504710650002204735650001104757650001704768650001004785650001604795650001004811650001104821650003004832650001604862650001404878650000704892650001604899650001504915650002104930650002804951650002204979700002505001700002305026700001705049700003405066700001605100700001705116700002005133700001905153700002005172700002505192773013305217856008205350852000905432655001205441IND60589405820221207141110.0180619e201802  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058940582DNAL7 a10.1007/s00394-017-1546-42doi7 aPMC58470242pmcid7 a290860612pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShortt, Colette10aSystematic review of the effects of the intestinal microbiota on selected nutrients and non-nutrients  ap. 25-49.  aReview  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aPURPOSE: There is considerable interest in the effects of the intestinal microbiota (IM) composition, its activities in relation with the metabolism of dietary substrates and the impact these effects may have in the development and prevention of certain non-communicable diseases. It is acknowledged that a complex interdependence exists between the IM and the mammalian host and that the IM possesses a far greater diversity of genes and repertoire of metabolic and enzymatic capabilities than their hosts. However, full knowledge of the metabolic activities and interactions of the IM and the functional redundancy that may exist are lacking. Thus, the current review aims to assess recent literature relating to the role played by the IM in the absorption and metabolism of key nutrients and non-nutrients. METHODS: A systematic review (PROSPERO registration: CRD42015019087) was carried out focussing on energy and the following candidate dietary substrates: protein, carbohydrate, fat, fibre, resistant starch (RS), and polyphenols to further understand the effect of the IM on the dietary substrates and the resulting by-products and host impacts. Particular attention was paid to the characterisation of the IM which are predominantly implicated in each case, changes in metabolites, and indirect markers and any potential impacts on the host. RESULTS: Studies show that the IM plays a key role in the metabolism of the substrates studied. However, with the exception of studies focusing on fibre and polyphenols, there have been relatively few recent human studies specifically evaluating microbial metabolism. In addition, comparison of the effects of the IM across studies was difficult due to lack of specific analysis/description of the bacteria involved. Considerable animal-derived data exist, but experience suggests that care must be taken when extrapolating these results to humans. Nevertheless, it appears that the IM plays a role in energy homeostasis and that protein microbial breakdown and fermentation produced ammonia, amines, phenols and branch chain fatty acids, and a greater diversity in the microbes present. Few recent studies appear to have evaluated the effect of the IM composition and metabolism per se in relation with digestible dietary carbohydrate or fat in humans. Intakes of RS and prebiotics altered levels of specific taxa that selectively metabolised specific prebiotic/carbohydrate-type substances and levels of bifidobacteria and lactobacilli were observed to increase. In controlled human studies, consistent data exist that show a correlation between the intake of fibre and an increase in bifidobacteria and short-chain fatty acids, in particular butyrate, which leads to lower intestinal pH. Dietary polyphenols rely on modification either by host digestive enzymes or those derived from the IM for absorption to occur. In the polyphenol-related studies, a large amount of inter-individual variation was observed in the microbial metabolism and absorption of certain polyphenols. CONCLUSIONS: The systematic review demonstrates that the IM plays a major role in the breakdown and transformation of the dietary substrates examined. However, recent human data are limited with the exception of data from studies examining fibres and polyphenols. Results observed in relation with dietary substrates were not always consistent or coherent across studies and methodological limitations and differences in IM analyses made comparisons difficult. Moreover, non-digestible components likely to reach the colon are often not well defined or characterised in studies making comparisons between studies difficult if not impossible. Going forward, further rigorously controlled randomised human trials with well-defined dietary substrates and utilizing omic-based technologies to characterise and measure the IM and their functional activities will advance the field. Current evidence suggests that more detailed knowledge of the metabolic activities and interactions of the IM hold considerable promise in relation with host health.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aBifidobacterium 3aLactobacillus 3aabsorption 3aamines 3aammonia 3abacteria 3abiochemical pathways 3abutyrates 3abyproducts 3acolon 3adietary carbohydrate 3adigestive enzymes 3aenergy 3afermentation 3agenes 3ahomeostasis 3ahosts 3ahumans 3aintestinal microorganisms 3ametabolites 3anutrients 3apH 3apolyphenols 3aprebiotics 3aresistant starch 3ashort chain fatty acids 3asystematic review1 aHasselwander, Oliver1 aMeynier, Alexandra1 aNauta, Arjen1 aFernández, EstefaníaNoriega1 aPutz, Peter1 aRowland, Ian1 aSwann, Jonathan1 aTürk, Jessica1 aVermeiren, Joan1 aAntoine, Jean-Michel0 tEuropean journal of nutrition.g2018 Feb., v. 57, no. 1 p.25-49dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl3949855x1436-62077nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00394-017-1546-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01246naa a2200229 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100002100112245006200133300001400195520058000209592002800789650001400817650003500831650001300866650001400879773010200893852000900995655001201004IND60612376620221121105540.0180905e199407  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061237662DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPORTER, DONNA V.10aHow Should the Recommended Dietary Allowances Be Revised?  ap. 33-34.  aThis question is the title of a recent publication of the Food and Nutrition Board (FNB) of the Institute of Medicine at the National Academy of Sciences and certainly has relevance to every professional concerned with the nutritional health of Americans.

Experiments performed in the 550–850°C temperature range showed high permeation rates reaching 0.6cm⁻³min⁻¹cm⁻² at 850°C for the higher CO2 content. These values exceed those often reported for similar membranes and conditions. Furthermore, the characterization of the ceramic skeletons and composite membranes by impedance spectroscopy (in air at low temperature) could be used to estimate the temperature where dual oxide and carbonate ionic transport are balanced (around 800°C).

Therefore, mtDNA haplotype diversity (h) is predicted to be lower than ncDNA heterozygosity (HE) because of the higher effect of genetic drift on mtDNA. This prediction has not yet been systematically tested. To this end, in this study, published data for 739 populations of 108 mammalian species (66 terrestrial and 42 marine species) revealed the following patterns: (a) h was higher than HE in 54.9% of populations, (b) the variance of h (0.097) was significantly higher than that of HE (0.018) and (c) the frequency distribution of h differed between terrestrial and marine species. The terrestrial species exhibited a U‐shaped distribution, whereas the marine species exhibited a right triangle shape. HE showed a unimodal distribution for both groups. (d) The mean of HE was similar between the terrestrial (0.668) and marine (0.672) species, whereas the mean of h was significantly lower for the terrestrial species (0.578) than for the marine species (0.740). Two hypotheses were considered to explain the above‐described patterns, one of which was based on the higher mutation rates of mtDNA, while the other was based on a nested subpopulation structure in which an ncDNA‐based population includes several mtDNA‐based subpopulations. Herein, the plausibility of these two hypotheses was discussed with a focus on the higher intraspecific variation of h.  aPublisher supplied data  a19H03005cJSPS KAKENHI  cThe Ecological Society of Japan: The ESJ award 2015 3afrequency distribution 3agenes 3agenetic drift 3ahaplotypes 3aheterozygosity 3aintraspecific variation 3amammals 3amicrosatellite repeats 3amitochondrial DNA 3amutation 3anuclear genome 3aprediction 3aresearch 3avariance0 tEcological research.g2021 Mar., v. 36, no. 2 p.206-220dJohn Wiley & Sons, Inc.wJournal:jnl3870047x0912-38147nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1440-1703.121903Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02705naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002500150245009300175300001600268520142700284592002801711650001601739650002701755650002401782650001701806650002001823650000901843650001101852650001101863650001801874650001701892650001401909650001501923653002201938653002401960653002401984653002902008700002702037700002302064773009002087856008502177852000902262655001202271IND60611016220221118062009.0201202e20181101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061101622DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2018.07.2082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchmeda-Lopez, Diego10aRadiation enhanced chemical production: Improving the value proposition of nuclear power  ap. 491-504.  aNuclear power is one of the means for large-scale CO₂-free heat and electricity generation. Commercial designs, developed decades ago, have not adopted technological innovations and struggle to be cost-competitive with state-of-the-art fossil-fuel power systems. Though fuel is relatively inexpensive, nuclear power plants are expensive to build and produce only low-value electricity. One strategy to improve the process economics is to use unique characteristics of nuclear reactors to provide additional sources of revenue by co-producing higher value products. A conceptual process is analysed, which combines a molten salt nuclear power reactor and a chemical process using the reactor's gamma radiation to facilitate the production of propylene. This facility is able to co-produce electricity and high volume commodity chemicals using, otherwise wasted radiation. The conceptual process model suggests that integration of units producing an energy product with one that produces more valuable chemicals leads to significant economic benefits for the overall facility. Despite the improvements, the system studied is unable to deliver an acceptable return on investment for small power plants independent of the size of the chemical plant integrated. Conversely, large plants are capable of delivering acceptable return on investment, in some cases generating returns comparable to other modern investment options.  aPublisher supplied data 3aelectricity 3aelectricity generation 3afinancial economics 3afossil fuels 3agamma radiation 3aheat 3aincome 3amodels 3anuclear power 3apower plants 3apropylene 3atechnology 0aNuclear economics 0aRadiation chemistry 0aProcess integration 0aTechno economic analysis1 aMcConnaughy, Thomas B.1 aMcFarland, Eric W.0 tEnergy.g2018 Nov. 01, v. 162 p.491-504dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2018.07.2083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02867naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001800139245017700157300001600334520145000350592002801800650001501828650002201843650000901865650000901874650003101883650002001914650001901934650001501953653001401968653002301982653001702005653001302022653002402035653002802059653002002087700001502107700002302122700001702145700002102162700002102183773012102204856007502325852000902400655001202409IND60527374020221121060345.0160715e20120222xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052737402DNAL7 a10.1021/am201465a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIshida, Yohei10aControlling the Microadsorption Structure of Porphyrin Dye Assembly on Clay Surfaces Using the “Size-Matching Rule” for Constructing an Efficient Energy Transfer System  ap. 811-816.  aThe microadsorption structure of two kinds of porphyrin molecules on an anionic clay surface was investigated by photochemical energy transfer reaction. Three procedures were examined for the preparation of the clay/porphyrin complexes: (i) coadsorption (CA) method, (ii) sequential adsorption (SA) method, and (iii) independent adsorption (IA) method as described in the text. Efficient and moderate energy transfer reactions were observed in the CA and SA complexes, respectively. On the contrary, the energy transfer did not occur in the IA complex. These results indicate that the microadsorption structure of the two kinds of porphyrin on the clay mineral surface resulting from the sample preparation methods, affects the energy transfer efficiency. As a result, it was revealed that (i) the adsorbed porphyrins can move on the clay mineral surface but cannot move from one clay surface to another clay sheet, and (ii) the integration structure of two kinds of porphyrin is more stable than the segregation structure in the present system. This unusual structure originated from an extremely strong electrostatic interaction between the porphyrin and the clay mineral as a result of a “size-matching rule”. These unique strongly fixed dye assemblies on the clay mineral surface, in which the aggregation and segregation of dyes are suppressed, is very promising and attractive for constructing efficient photochemical reaction systems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3achemical elements 3aclay 3adyes 3aelectrostatic interactions 3aenergy transfer 3aphotochemistry 3aporphyrins 0aporphyrin 0asize-matching rule 0aclay mineral 0asaponite 0amolecular alignment 0alight-harvesting system 0aenergy transfer1 aMasui, Dai1 aTachibana, Hiroshi1 aInoue, Haruo1 aShimada, Tetsuya1 aTakagi, Shinsuke0 tACS Applied Materials & Interfaces.g2012 Feb. 22, v. 4, no. 2 p.811-816dAmerican Chemical Societyx1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fam201465a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02966naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003800113040001800151100002400169245010100193300001600294520132500310592002801635650001201663650001901675650002301694650001501717650001501732650001801747650002401765650002201789650001201811650003101823650001301854650003001867650001401897650002401911650002401935650001601959650004201975650002402017653003102041653002402072653001702096653001602113653001602129700002102145700002202166700001902188700001802207773012702225856005102352852000902403655001202412IND50076442820221120211325.0140410e20130601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007644282DNAL7 a234454102pmid7 a10.1080/10934529.2013.7445632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTakamitsu, Yasuyuki10aCombustion of volatile organic compounds over composite catalyst of Pt/γ-Al2O3 and beta zeolite  ap. 667-674.  aCatalytic oxidation of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) was carried out over a composite catalyst comprising Pt/γ-Al₂O₃ and protonated beta zeolite. The conversion of several VOCs such as ethyl acetate, butyl acetate, 2-propanol, 1,2-dichloroethane, and chloroethane over the composite catalyst was higher than the conversion over the conventional Pt/γ-Al₂O₃ catalyst, indicating a remarkable improvement in the oxidation activity of the composite. On the other hand, no difference in the conversion of methyl ethyl ketone, methyl isobutyl ketone, toluene, benzene, and chloroethylene was observed for the composite catalyst versus the Pt/γ-Al₂O₃ catalyst. To clarify the role of the zeolite component, the reaction products obtained using the composite catalyst were compared with those obtained using the Pt/γ-Al₂O₃ catalyst. For the cases in which considerable improvement in the oxidation activity was observed with the composite, it was revealed that the conversion of VOCs to intermediate compounds took place over the acidic sites of the zeolite; the intermediates tended to be easily oxidized to CO₂ on the Pt/γ-Al₂O₃ catalyst. In addition, the composite catalyst also exhibited high durability. High catalytic activity was maintained even after aging at 600°C for more than 1000 h.  aPublisher supplied data 3abenzene 3acarbon dioxide 3acatalytic activity 3acombustion 3adurability 3aethyl acetate 3aethylene dichloride 3aisopropyl alcohol 3atoluene 3avolatile organic compounds 3azeolites 2aAluminum Oxidexchemistry 2aCatalysis 2aOxidation-Reduction 2aPlatinumxchemistry 2aTemperature 2aVolatile Organic Compoundsxchemistry 2aZeolitesxchemistry 0aVolatile organic compounds 0acatalytic oxidation 0abeta zeolite 0aPt catalyst 0adurability.1 aYoshida, Satoshi1 aKobayashi, Wataru1 aOgawa, Hiroshi1 aSano, Tsuneji0 tJournal of environmental science and health.g2013 June 1, v. 48, no. 7 p.667-674dTaylor & Francis Groupx1532-41177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10934529.2013.744563  aDNAL 7aarticle03070naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100003800143245013500181300001600316520145200332592002801784650001701812650001901829650001401848650001001862650002601872650001501898650001301913650002101926650001301947650001301960650003901973650001302012650001502025650001102040650002702051650001302078650002902091653001402120653001302134653001502147653006402162700002502226700002302251700001902274700002102293773015102314856007802465852000902543655001202552IND60539535620221116183742.0190318e201501  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053953562DNAL7 a10.3168/jds.2014-81432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHernández-Castellano, Lorenzo E.10aColostrum protein uptake in neonatal lambs examined by descriptive and quantitative liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry  ap. 135-147.  aColostrum intake is a key factor for newborn ruminant survival because the placenta does not allow the transfer of immune components. Therefore, newborn ruminants depend entirely on passive immunity transfer from the mother to the neonate, through the suckling of colostrum. Understanding the importance of specific colostrum proteins has gained significant attention in recent years. However, proteomics studies of sheep colostrum and their uptake in neonate lambs has not yet been presented. The aim of this study was to describe the proteomes of sheep colostrum and lamb blood plasma, using sodium dodecyl sulfate-PAGE for protein separation and in-gel digestion, followed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry of resulting tryptic peptides for protein identification. An isobaric tag for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ)-based proteomics approach was subsequently used to provide relative quantification of how neonatal plasma protein concentrations change as an effect of colostrum intake. The results of this study describe the presence of 70 proteins in the ovine colostrum proteome. Furthermore, colostrum intake resulted in an increase of 8 proteins with important immune functions in the blood plasma of lambs. Further proteomic studies will be necessary, particularly using the selected reaction monitoring approach, to describe in detail the role of specific colostrum proteins for immune transfer to the neonate.  aPublisher supplied data 3ablood plasma 3ablood proteins 3acolostrum 3alambs 3aliquid chromatography 3amonitoring 3aneonates 3apassive immunity 3apeptides 3aplacenta 3apolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 3aproteome 3aproteomics 3asodium 3asodium dodecyl sulfate 3asuckling 3atandem mass spectrometry 0acolostrum 0aimmunity 0aproteomics 0aisobaric tag for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ)1 aArgüello, Anastasio1 aAlmeida, André M.1 aCastro, Noemí1 aBendixen, Emøke0 tJournal of dairy science.g2015 Jan., v. 98, no. 1 p.135-147dElsevier Inc.aAmerican Dairy Science AssociationwJournal:jnl45500x0022-03027nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3168/jds.2014-81433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02222naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001200151245014700163300001800310520093000328592002801258650001401286650001001300650003301310650001301343650002001356653002201376653001801398653001401416653002501430653001401455700001501469700001401484700001501498700001601513700001601529700002001545700001501565773012501580856008601705852000901791655001201800IND60778648220221120105724.0220530e20220523xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077864822DNAL7 a10.1080/14786419.2021.19001762doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Hao10aIntegrating UPLC-QE-Orbitrap-MS technology and network pharmacological method to reveal the mechanism of Bailemian capsule to relieve insomnia  ap. 2554-2558.  aBailemian capsule (BLMC) is a Chinese patent drug for treating insomnia with excellent curative effects. But there are few researches on it. In this research, a rapid separation and identification method using UPLC-QE-Orbitrap-MS was established, and 228 identified compounds were separated within 18 min. The structures of compounds were preliminarily determined by comparing the retention time and fragmentation law. Furthermore, multiple databases were used to integrate the compound targets of BLMC and the disease targets related to insomnia. After the intersection of the two sets of targets, a protein-protein interaction network and a drug-target-disease pharmacological network were established, then using the DAVID database to perform GO analysis and KEGG analysis on the common targets to find related pathways. Finally, a total of 289 common targets and 136 pathways were found to participate in the mechanism.  aPublisher supplied data 3adatabases 3adrugs 3aprotein-protein interactions 3aresearch 3asleep disorders 0aBailemian capsule 0aanti-insomnia 0achemomics 0anetwork pharmacology 0amechanism1 aCao, Yijia1 aQu, Yuxia1 aLi, Tianyi1 aWang, Jiaqi1 aYang, Yuwei1 aZhang, Chenning1 aSun, Yikun0 tNatural product research.g2022 May 23, v. 36, no. 10 p.2554-2558dTaylor & FranciswJournal:J000000126x1478-64277nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14786419.2021.19001763Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02639naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001400150245012400164300001600288520130900304592002801613650001901641650003101660650002701691650002101718650001101739650001101750653002201761653002401783653002101807653006901828653001901897653004301916700005301959700005702012773009002069856008502159852000902244655001202253IND60611016420221118061848.0201202e20181101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061101642DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2018.08.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBhola, M.10aReducing fuel consumption of Front End Loader using regenerative hydro-static drive configuration-an experimental study  ap. 158-170.  aPresent paper highlights the effect of under-loading the engine and the hydraulic system of a Front End Loader (FEL). In this respect, a novel idea to modify load cycle of engine is applied in the Conventional Hydrostatic-Split Power Transmission (CH-SPT) drive by incorporating additional load on the drive through the DC generator. The load on modified system, called Regenerative Hydrostatic-split power transmission (RH-SPT) drive is the loading pump unit and DC generator unit, which is used for generating equivalent duty cycle of the FEL and electrical energy generation, respectively. The excess load of the DC generator is varied through the controller depending on engine's optimal efficient torque and the load torque. This assists the engine to operate in its efficient zone during under-loading conditions. Also, a MATLAB®/Simulink model is made and validated experimentally. The validated model is analysed to compare the performances and fuel consumption of conventional HST drive, CH-SPT drive and RH-SPT drive. It is concluded that with increase in fuel consumption of the RH-SPT system by 10% and 56% of the CH-SPT and conventional drive system, the electric power regeneration through the DC generator increases by 21% and 200% of the maximum power generated in the respective system.  aPublisher supplied data 3aelectric power 3aenergy use and consumption 3agenerators (equipment) 3amodel validation 3amodels 3atorque 0aEnergy management 0aEnergy regeneration 0aFuel consumption 0aRegenerative hydrostatic-split power transmission (RH-SPT) drive 0aPID controller 0aBrake specific fuel consumption (bsfc)1 aKumar, N.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8859-67821 aGhoshal, S.K.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6477-31740 tEnergy.g2018 Nov. 01, v. 162 p.158-170dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2018.08.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02566naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001900145245012500164300001800289500001100307520078100318592002801099596005901127596005901186596007401245596001901319596001901338596001901357596002301376596005101399596008401450650002401534650001101558650000901569650001601578700001701594700001801611700001401629700001601643700001701659700001601676700001201692700001401704700001501718700001501733700001501748700001801763700001401781700001201795773011601807856008001923852000902003655001202012IND60786812620221118213217.0220806e201707  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078681262DNAL7 a10.1002/1873-3468.126902doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Shuaiwei10aDNMT1 cooperates with MBD4 to inhibit the expression of Glucocorticoid‐induced TNFR‐related protein in human T cells  ap. 1929-1939.  aLETTER  aGlucocorticoid‐induced TNFR‐related protein (GITR) is constitutively expressed in T regulatory (Treg) cells and regulates their suppressive function. We identified two methylated CpG islands in the Gitr locus. Using a ChIP assay, we demonstrate that both DNMT1 and methyl‐CpG‐binding domain Protein 4 (MBD4) bind to the Gitr promoter. Moreover, knockdown of DNMT1 decreases the binding activity of MBD4. We observed much higher levels of both DNMT1 and MBD4 in human CD4⁺CD25⁻ conventional T (Tconv) cells. Moreover, co‐overexpression of DNMT1 and MBD4 in Treg cells significantly inhibits GITR expression and impairs their suppressive activity. Our results reveal a novel molecular mechanism by which MBD4 inhibits GITR expression in a DNMT1‐dependent manner.  aPublisher supplied data  a2014CB541903cNational Basic Research Program of China  a2014CB541803cNational Basic Research Program of China  a31525008cNational Science Foundation of Distinguished Young Scholars  a31370863cNSFC  a81330072cNSFC  a31670911cNSFC  a14JC1406100cSMCST  a16XD1403800cShanghai Academic Research Leader  aXDB19000000cStrategic Priority Research Program of Chinese Academy of Sciences 3aDNA-binding domains 3ahumans 3aloci 3amethylation1 aLi, Yangyang1 aZhu, Fangming1 aLin, Fang1 aLuo, Xuerui1 aZhao, Binbin1 aZhang, Peng1 aLi, Dan1 aGao, Yayi1 aLiang, Rui1 aLiu, Luyan1 aTsun, Andy1 aYuan, Xiaojun1 aWu, Kejin1 aLi, Bin0 tFEBS letters.g2017 July, v. 591, no. 13 p.1929-1939dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl16404x0014-57937nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/1873-3468.126903Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02366naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001500151245010800166300001800274520048000292536046400772592002801236596002001264596003401284596001801318596001701336650001701353650001701370650001101387650001901398650001301417653001801430653001801448653002701466653002401493653002301517700001801540700002001558700001401578700001501592700001801607700002201625700001701647773012501664856008601789852000901875655001201884IND60778648320221120105605.0220530e20220523xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077864832DNAL7 a10.1080/14786419.2021.19016992doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPeng, Jing10aNew piericidin derivatives from the marine-derived streptomyces sp.

Here, we examined whether CheY acetylation is involved in chemotactic adaptation. A mutant lacking the acetylating enzyme acetyl‐CoA synthetase (Acs) requires more time to adapt to attractant stimulation, and vice versa to repellent stimulation. This effect is avoided by conditions that favor production of acetyl‐CoA, thus enabling Acs‐independent CheY autoacetylation, or reversed by expressing Acs from a plasmid. These findings suggest that CheY should be acetylated for ordinary adaptation time, and that the function of this acetylation in adaptation is to enable the motor to shift its rotation to clockwise. We further identify the enzyme phosphotransacetylase as a third deacetylase of CheY in E. coli.  aPublisher supplied data  a2013197cUS‐Israel Binational Science Foundation  a66/14cIsrael Science Foundation 3aEscherichia coli 3aacetate-CoA ligase 3aacetyl coenzyme A 3aacetylation 3achemotaxis 3amutants 3aplasmids1 aEisenbach, Michael0 tFEBS letters.g2017 July, v. 591, no. 13 p.1958-1965dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl16404x0014-57937nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/1873-3468.126993Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02365naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245012700159300001800286520097100304592002801275650002101303650002701324650002701351650002601378650001901404650002701423650002301450650002301473650001301496650002301509650002201532650001201554650001401566650001501580650001501595700001701610700001701627700001201644700001701656700001701673773013401690856007401824852000901898655001201907IND60630805420221123032101.0190214e20190212xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063080542DNAL7 a10.1039/c8cc09986c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Shuoshuo12aA bio-inspired, one-step but versatile coating onto various substrates with strong antibacterial and enhanced osteogenesis  ap. 2058-2061.  aIt is of great interest to prepare osteogenic and antibacterial coatings for successful implants. Current coating techniques suffer from being time-consuming, substrate material or shape dependence, expensive equipment, environmental pollution, low stability, processes that are difficult to control, etc. Herein, inspired by mussels, we report a one-step and versatile method to fabricate a dual functional coating. The coating is finished in minutes independently of materials or dimensions of substrates. Thus, our coatings exhibit strong antibacterial ability against both Gram-positive bacteria S. aureus, and Gram-negative bacteria E. coli, support the proliferation of dental pulp stem cells (DPSCs), and are powerful for inducing osteogenic differentiation. The universality, facility, rapidness, and mildness of our coating process, which is also environmentally-friendly and cost-effective, points towards potential applications in bone or dental implants.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aGram-negative bacteria 3aGram-positive bacteria 3aStaphylococcus aureus 3abone formation 3achemical communication 3achemical compounds 3achemical reactions 3acoatings 3acost effectiveness 3adental prosthesis 3amussels 3apollution 3astem cells 3atooth pulp1 aXu, Yongpeng1 aLin, Quankui1 aBai, Yu1 aZan, Xingjie1 aYe, Qingsong0 tChemical communications.g2019 Feb. 12, v. 55, no. 14 p.2058-2061dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26910x1364-548X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c8cc09986c3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02513naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245011200171300001400283520129000297592002801587650000801615650001401623650001901637650002001656650001801676650003001694650001101724650001101735650001801746653004201764653002801806653002701834653002801861700002301889700002101912773008801933856008502021852000902106655001202115IND60611016620221118063401.0201202e20181101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061101662DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2018.08.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBlaszczuk, Artur10aHeat transfer characteristics in a large-scale bubbling fluidized bed with immersed horizontal tube bundles  ap. 10-19.  aThis work investigates heat transfer characteristics in a bubbling fluidized bed with a submerged superheater tube bundles under conditions of an integrated fluidized bed heat exchanger (Integrated Recycle Heat Exchanger, Intrexᵗᵐ) of a large-scale circulating fluidized bed boiler. The effect of mean bed particle size, normalized suspension density, and fluidizing number on the average heat transfer coefficient between the immersed horizontal tubes and the bed was evaluated. The physical parameters of bed particles and fluidizing air in the external heat exchanger were measured at different CFB unit loads. Bubble fraction and contacting time of emulsion phase on the heat transfer surface were calculated on the basis of operating data of fluidized bed heat exchanger. A mechanistic heat transfer model was used to predict the heat transfer coefficient. Depending on emulsion density and the local dynamics of gas and bed particles, the average heat transfer coefficient (hₐᵥg) varied in a range of 255–381 W/(m²K), showing an increasing trend with the decrease in bed particle size. Moreover, hₐᵥg decreased with increasing emulsion contact time on the tube surface with the reduction of the solids mixing. Obtained results were compared with literature data.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3aemulsions 3afluidized beds 3aheat exchangers 3aheat transfer 3aheat transfer coefficient 3amixing 3amodels 3aparticle size 0aBed-to-tube heat transfer coefficient 0aExternal heat exchanger 0aBubbling fluidized bed 0aHorizontal tube bundles1 aPogorzelec, Michal1 aShimizu, Tadaaki0 tEnergy.g2018 Nov. 01, v. 162 p.10-19dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2018.08.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03459naa a2200649 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003800113040001800151100002400169245014000193300001600333520154900349592002801898650002401926650002401950650002701974650000902001650001202010650001302022650001102035650002202046650001302068650000902081650000902090650001402099650001402113650001102127650000902138650001402147650000902161650002502170650003802195650003902233650002102272650002802293650002002321650003002341650002502371650001302396651001102409651001102420653001702431653001002448653002402458653002702482700003302509700002102542700002102563700002602584773012702610856005102737852000902788655001202797IND50076443020221120200732.0140410e20130601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007644302DNAL7 a234454122pmid7 a10.1080/10934529.2013.7445782doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWojtuń, Bronisław10aAndromeda polifolia and Oxycoccus microcarpus as pollution indicators for ombrotrophic bogs in the Western Sudety Mountains (SW Poland)  ap. 686-693.  aConcentrations of the elements Cd, Cr, Cu, Fe, Li, Mn, N, Ni, Pb and Zn in Andromeda polifolia, Oxycoccus microcarpus and in the peat in which these plants grew were measured in the Western Sudety (Karkonosze and Izerskie Mts., SW Poland). Of both the investigated plant fruit, O. microcarpus harvested from wild populations are commonly used as medicines. Samples from ombrotrophic bogs were investigated within the area influenced by exhausts of the former Black Triangle, one of the most heavily industrialized and polluted areas in Europe. A. polifolia and O. microcarpus growing at the highest elevations contained the highest Cu, Li, Ni, Mn and Zn concentrations and in addition O. microcarpus also contained the highest Cr concentrations. Both the investigated species have wide circumpolar distribution in ombrotrophic mires of the Northern hemisphere. As this type of mires is nourished solely by atmospheric deposition, the increased metal concentrations in A. polifolia and O. microcarpus may be an indication that their habitats receive an atmospheric input of long-range transported pollution. Our investigation proves that both species are able to accumulate elevated metal levels and may be used in the bioindication of the metal status in ombrotrophic mires. Controlling the collection of O. microcarpus fruit for consumption and medicinal purposes is recommended as this species can accumulate increased metal levels. However, further more detailed studies are necessary to verify the inner translocation of metals into fruit.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAndromeda polifolia 3aVaccinium oxycoccos 3aatmospheric deposition 3abogs 3acadmium 3achromium 3acopper 3afruit consumption 3ahabitats 3airon 3alead 3amanganese 3amountains 3anickel 3apeat 3apollution 3azinc 2aAnalysis of Variance 2aEnvironmental Monitoringxmethods 2aEnvironmental Pollutantsxanalysis 2aFruitxchemistry 2aMetals, Heavyxanalysis 2aSoilxanalysis. 2aSpectrophotometry, Atomic 2aVacciniumxchemistry 2aWetlands 3aPoland 0aPoland 0aOmbrotrophic 0ametal 0aAndromeda polifolia 0aOxycoccus microcarpus.1 aSamecka-Cymerman, Aleksandra1 aKolon, Krzysztof1 aKlink, Agnieszka1 aKempers, Alexander J.0 tJournal of environmental science and health.g2013 June 1, v. 48, no. 7 p.686-693dTaylor & Francis Groupx1532-41177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10934529.2013.744578  aDNAL 7aarticle03257naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245013200168300001800300500001900318520142500337536017701762592002801939596011901967596009802086650001902184650002002203650001402223650001802237650001602255650001502271650002902286650001002315650001402325650001602339653002402355653002802379653002402407700001202431700001502443700001802458700001302476700001302489700001702502700001802519773012002537856008502657852000902742655001202751IND60694673520221118034154.0200513e20200606xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069467352DNAL7 a10.1080/09593330.2018.15433592doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuang, Qiong10aFabrication of MnOₓ-CeO₂/cordierite catalysts doped with FeOₓ and CuO for preferable catalytic oxidation of chlorobenzene  ap. 1664-1676.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aA series of MnOₓ-CeO₂ catalysts with MOₓ doping (M = Cu, Fe, Co and La) supported on cordierite were synthesized by the citric acid complex method, showing preferable catalytic oxidation of chlorobenzene. The distribution of active oxides, surface areas, as well as the structural morphology of M-MnOₓ-CeO₂ catalysts varied with the different Mn/Ce and M/Mn molar ratios. Meanwhile, physicochemical properties of these catalysts were characterized by XRD, BET, SEM, TEM, H₂-TPR and IR. More importantly, the catalytic oxidation routes were also investigated where the process was from chlorobenzene to CO₂, H₂O, HCl and other by-products for the FeOₓ-MnOₓ-CeO₂ and CuO-MnOₓ-CeO₂ catalysts. The CuO-MnOₓ-CeO₂ catalysts showed a higher chlorobenzene conversion, and the measured light-off temperature T₉₀ was approximately 400°C. However, a large amount of chloropropane as main by-products was observed. For the FeOₓ-MnOₓ-CeO₂ catalysts, more carbon monoxide could be found with inadequate oxidation. Comparative analyses of two catalysts indicated that the main cause of the oxidation activities and mechanisms were different in the oxidation capacity and water absorbability of FeOₓ and CuO. Nevertheless, all of these catalysts did not exhibit any deactivation due to chloride with a high reaction temperature, with chloride transformed to form HCl in the off-gas stream.  aThe Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province [grant numbers BK20170954 and BK 201520150890]; The National Natural Science Foundation of China [grant number 21501097].  aPublisher supplied data  aBK20170954aBK 201520150890cNatural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Provincedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100004608  a21501097cNational Natural Science Foundation of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001809 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbon monoxide 3achlorides 3achlorobenzene 3acitric acid 3acordierite 3aenvironmental technology 3agases 3aoxidation 3atemperature 0aMnOx-CeO2 catalysts 0atransition metal oxides 0acatalytic oxidation1 aSi, Han1 aYu, Shukun1 aWang, Jiaxiao1 aTao, Tao1 aYang, Bo1 aZhao, Yunxia1 aChen, Mindong0 tEnvironmental technology.g2020 June 6, v. 41, no. 13 p.1664-1676dTaylor & FranciswJournal:12281x1479-487X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09593330.2018.15433593Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02663naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001500140245010100155300001800256520147400274592002801748650001701776650001301793650002001806650001201826650004401838650002301882650001901905650002401924650001601948650001301964700001401977700001601991700002102007700001402028700001502042773012502057856007402182852000902256655001202265IND60639822820221122133904.0190503e20160531xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063982282DNAL7 a10.1039/c5gc03102h2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPuchot, L.10aBreaking the symmetry of dibenzoxazines: a paradigm to tailor the design of bio-based thermosets  ap. 3346-3353.  aWith the ongoing efforts to promote the development of bio-based dibenzoxazine thermosets, we explore herein a new strategy aiming at the synthesis of asymmetric dibenzoxazine monomers from naturally occurring phenolic compounds, cardanol and vanillin. By taking advantage of the low reactivity of cardanol, a monosubstituted cardanol-based benzoxazine monomer was prepared and further coupled with vanillin to yield vanillin–cardanol di-benzoxazines. The structural features of the resulting products were substantiated by ¹H NMR and HR-MS. The occurrence of the thermally-induced ring-opening polymerization was monitored by rheological measurements and DSC. At 190 °C the new asymmetric monomers showed a moderate gelation time (8 min) compared to 30–31 min revealed for cardanol-based (di-card) dibenzoxazines. Once polymerized, they exhibited a high Tg (129 °C), while the di-card flew under heating because of its low cross-linking density. Asymmetric monomers also exhibited lower melting temperatures than their symmetrical congeners based on vanillin, which significantly enlarge the processing window between the melting and polymerization temperatures up to 126 °C instead of 7 °C for symmetric vanillin-based dibenzoxazines. Therefore, such a strategy constitutes an efficient and versatile route for an easy elaboration of biobased monocomponent thermosets and can be applied to a wide range of phenolic compounds derived from renewable resources.  aPublisher supplied data 3acrosslinking 3agelation 3agreen chemistry 3amelting 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aphenolic compounds 3apolymerization 3arenewable resources 3atemperature 3avanillin1 aVerge, P.1 aFouquet, T.1 aVancaeyzeele, C.1 aVidal, F.1 aHabibi, Y.0 tGreen chemistry.g2016 May 31, v. 18, no. 11 p.3346-3353dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26906x1463-92707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c5gc03102h3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03740naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100005600139245013800195300001800333500002000351520195700371592002802328596003302356596003402389596004802423596003602471650001402507650001902521650001002540650002902550650001202579650002802591650001202619650001902631650002402650650000902674650001002683650001402693650001902707650001902726650001402745650002002759650001602779650002302795650001602818700001802834700001802852700001902870700002202889700006002911773012002971856007403091852000903165655001203174IND60753468120221116154239.0211015e202111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075346812DNAL7 a10.1111/fwb.138152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBelle, Simon1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3537-453110aBoth climate trends and short‐term fluctuations affected algae–zooplankton interactions in a boreal lake during the late Holocene  ap. 2076-2085.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aMost studies aiming to explore the response of algae and zooplankton trophic interactions to climate variability have only been focused on unidirectional and very short‐term trends in temperature changes. As a result, the non‐stationary aspect of climate change (warming and cooling periods, frequencies) remains completely unstudied. We studied elemental and stable isotope composition of sedimentary organic matter, photosynthetic pigments, and carbon stable isotope composition of Cladocera resting eggs in a sediment record covering the last c. 2,600 years. We examined how past climate change acting at different timescales affected algal biomass and community composition, and carbon assimilation by zooplankton in a boreal lake. Our study revealed major effects of both long‐term climate trends and shorter‐term fluctuations on algae–zooplankton interactions in a boreal lake. We found the main climate trends, in particular the Little Ice Age, induced algal biomass and community composition changes and drastic changes in carbon assimilation by zooplankton. Interestingly, we found that temperature fluctuations could also contribute to regulating algae–zooplankton interactions. Specifically, we observed drastic changes in sedimentary markers and stable isotope composition of zooplankton remains during the most recent period, suggesting a strong influence of ongoing anthropogenic change on algae–zooplankton interactions. Our study confirms previous findings showing close long‐term linkage between the temporal dynamics of zooplankton diet and planktonic algae, and that both climate trends and short‐term fluctuations are key in regulating consumer–resource trophic interactions. Novel approaches that combine high temporal resolution paleolimnological reconstructions and contemporary monitoring studies are needed to better understand climate change effects on algae–zooplankton interactions and lake food webs.  aPublisher supplied data  aPRG709cEesti Teadusagentuur  aPRG1167cEesti Teadusagentuur  a2016‐861cSvenska Forskningsrådet Formas  cOscar and Lilli Lamm Foundation 3aCladocera 3aHolocene epoch 3aalgae 3aanthropogenic activities 3abiomass 3acarbon dioxide fixation 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3acommunity structure 3adiet 3alakes 3alimnology 3aorganic matter 3aphotosynthesis 3asediments 3astable isotopes 3atemperature 3atemporal variation 3azooplankton1 aTõnno, Ilmar1 aVrede, Tobias1 aFreiberg, Rene1 aL.

Both the herbicides, either singly or in a combination, stimulated the growth and activities of N2-fixing bacteria resulting in higher mineralization and availability of nitrogen in soil. The single application of quizalofop increased the proliferation of aerobic non-symbiotic N2-fixing bacteria to the highest extent while that of pendimethalin exerted maximum stimulation to their N2-fixing capacity in soil. Both the herbicides, either alone or in a combination, did not have any significant difference in the stimulation of total nitrogen content and availability of exchangeable NH4 + while the solubility of NO3 − was highly manifested when the herbicides were applied separately in soil.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactive ingredients 3abacteria 3anitrogen 3anitrogen content 3anitrogen fixation 3apendimethalin 3aquizalofop 3asoil 2aAniline Compoundsxpharmacology 2aBacteriaxdrug effectsxgrowth & development. 2aHerbicidesxpharmacology 2aNitrogenxmetabolism 2aNitrogen Fixationxdrug effects 2aPropionatesxpharmacology 2aQuinoxalinesxpharmacology 2aSoil Microbiology 2aSoil Pollutants 3aIndia 0aIndia1 aNayek, Hemanta1 aNongthombam, S.

Tactile, visual, and chemical cues were presented in a factorial manner, and time was measured between initial contact and either inhabitation of a shell or initiation of feeding. We considered the time difference between initial contact and subsequent behavior to be a measure of hermit crab ‘decision time’. For shell acquisition experiments, treatments that included tactile cues elicited significantly shorter decision times (8.5–117.1s), than treatments without tactile cues (294.5–765.2s). In contrast to the shell acquisition experiment, we found that in food acquisition experiments, treatments that included chemical cues elicited significantly shorter decision times (78.4–450.5s), than those without chemical cues (570.0–778.1s). Although primary cues elicited the shortest decision times during foraging and shell-seeking, in the absence of the primary cue, secondary cues could still be used to make appropriate decisions, albeit with significantly longer decision times. Therefore we propose that hermit crabs sort environmental information in ‘Contextual Decision Hierarchies’ in order to make accurate and efficient behavioral choices.  aPublisher supplied data 3acrabs 3adecision making 3afood availability 3aforaging 3ashell (molluscs)1 aDunbar, Stephen G.0 tJournal of experimental marine biology and ecology.g2011 Feb. 28, v. 398, no. 1-2 p.26-32dElsevier B.V.x0022-09817nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jembe.2010.11.0263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04133naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100005500152245013400207300001400341520253800355592002802893650001302921650002602934650001602960650001102976650001302987650001903000650001203019650003003031650001103061650001503072650001103087650002003098651001003118651001903128651001003147651001803157651001703175651001503192653003503207653001903242653002003261653001803281653001503299653002603314700001503340700001803355700001703373773010503390856008703495852000903582655001203591IND60618077720221118101846.0200210e20190115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061807772DNAL7 a10.1016/j.atmosenv.2018.10.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHan, Zhiwei1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5623-122512aA regional model study of the characteristics and indirect effects of marine primary organic aerosol in springtime over East Asia  ap. 22-35.  aAn online coupled regional chemistry-aerosol-climate model was developed and applied to explore the distribution, evolution and indirect effects of marine primary organic aerosols (MPOA) over East Asia during the period from 12 March to 22 April 2014. Model results were compared with a variety of observations from ground measurement, cruise experiment and satellite retrievals, which demonstrated the model was capable of reproducing reasonably well the major features in meteorological variables, gas species, aerosol components and cloud properties in the western Pacific Ocean in springtime. Active bloom events were observed in the western Pacific Ocean during the study period, with mean surface seawater Chlorophyll a (Chl-a) concentrations up to 10 mg m⁻³ in the Yellow Sea, East China Sea, Sea of Japan, as well as the ocean northeast of Japan. The mean surface MPOA concentration was simulated to be up to 2.5 μg m⁻³ in the East China Sea, followed by that in the ocean northeast of Japan, and about 0.5 μg m⁻³ in the coastal areas of east China. MPOA generally caused increases in the cloud condensation nuclei (CCN), cloud droplet number concentration (CDNC), cloud optical depth (COD) and cloud liquid water path (CLWP), but decrease in the cloud droplet effective radius (CDER). The above changes in cloud properties induced a negative indirect radiative effect (IRE), with the mean values being −5.3 Wm⁻², −8.2 Wm⁻² and -12.2 Wm⁻² over the ocean, East China Sea and the north western Pacific Ocean, which accounted for about 40%, 35% and 51% of the IRE due to all aerosols in these regions, respectively. It was noteworthy that the MPOA induced IRE was −3.6 Wm⁻² in east China, accounting for 20% of the IRE by all aerosols and the percentage contribution was about 32% for the whole domain, suggesting its important influence on cloud and radiation during the study period. The sensitivity of MPOA activation to the factors affecting hygroscopicity and surface tension was examined by sensitivity simulations. The indirect effects of MPOA tended to suppress precipitation in most of the domain, with the maximum decrease in the accumulated precipitation up to 50 mm in parts of south China and the East China Sea. In terms of domain average, MPOA accounted for 16%, 22%, 18% of the precipitation reduction due to all aerosols over the land, ocean and the whole domain, respectively, indicating its nonnegligible influence on precipitation over East Asia in springtime 2014.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaerosols 3aatmospheric chemistry 3achlorophyll 3acoasts 3adroplets 3ahygroscopicity 3aliquids 3ameteorological parameters 3amodels 3asatellites 3aspring 3asurface tension 3aChina 3aEast China Sea 3aJapan 3aPacific Ocean 3aSea of Japan 3aYellow Sea 0aMarine primary organic aerosol 0aCloud property 0aIndirect effect 0aPrecipitation 0aEast China 0aWestern pacific ocean1 aLi, Jiawei1 aYao, Xiaohong1 aTan, Saichun0 tAtmospheric environment.g2019 Jan. 15, v. 197 p.22-35dElsevier LtdwJournal:12031x1352-23107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.atmosenv.2018.10.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02716naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245010700171300001600278520138700294592002801681650002001709650003501729650001401764650001401778650001701792650000901809650001501818650001901833650002101852650001901873650001801892653004101910653000901951653002301960653001501983653001901998653002102017700001802038700002302056700001802079773010102097856005102198852000902249655001202258IND50075545220221122202904.0140410e20110201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007554522DNAL7 a10.1080/02757540.2010.5344642doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBarbafieri, Meri10aField assessment of Pb in contaminated soils and in leaf mustard (Brassica juncea): the LIBS technique  ap. 161-169.  aMonitoring contaminated sites is faster and cheaper if portable analytical instruments are used rather than traditional laboratory analysis. We developed a transportable system based on the laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) technique for rapid on-site measurement of heavy metal concentrations. Portable instruments also offer great advantages for on-site remediation technology, where continuous monitoring is required. LIBS is especially useful when plants are used to remove or contain contaminants. Phytoremediation takes time to achieve its goals, and many analyses are required to evaluate its efficiency during the process. In this study, LIBS was used to measure Pb concentration in soils from three contaminated sites and in plant samples from phytoremediation experiments. Results obtained from LIBS show good correlation with data obtained with atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS). In particular, in the case of contaminated site characterisation, LIBS permits delimitation of areas showing metal concentration over the legal limits, where further investigations are required. Speeding up the characterisation procedure decreases investigation costs and increases the number of analysed samples with a given economic budget, thus increasing the informational value of data. Thus reliable spatial information can be obtained, leading to lower remediation costs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBrassica juncea 3aatomic absorption spectrometry 3aeconomics 3aequipment 3aheavy metals 3alead 3amonitoring 3amustard greens 3aphytoremediation 3apolluted soils 3arapid methods 0alaser-induced breakdown spectroscopy 0alead 0asoil contamination 0amonitoring 0aplant material 0aphytoremediation1 aPini, Roberto1 aCiucci, Alessandro1 aTassi, Eliana0 tChemistry in ecology.g2011 Feb. 1, v. 27, no. sup1 p.161-169dTaylor & Francisx1029-03707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02757540.2010.534464  aDNAL 7aarticle04331naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002200151245013600173300001800309520140000327536120301727592002802930596009502958650002303053650002903076650001103105650001303116650001003129650001303139650001403152650002003166650001403186650001603200650001703216650002203233650002303255650001503278651001503293651001803308653002003326653002503346653001603371653002403387653001903411653001403430653001303444653002303457653001803480700002503498700002203523773012603545856008503671852000903756655001203765IND60660594220221118172250.0190823e20190611xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066059422DNAL7 a10.1080/00222933.2019.16443852doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHenry, Charles S.12aA new lacewing species of the Chrysoperla carnea species-group from central Asia associated with conifers (Neuroptera: Chrysopidae)  ap. 1277-1300.  aChrysoperla duellii sp. nov. is discovered, associated with coniferous vegetation, in the Kyrgyz Republic in central Asia, co-occurring with two other cryptic species of the Chrysoperla carnea-group. It is distinguished by its courtship duetting song, which exhibits a uniquely complex multi-volleyed temporal and tonal structure but is nevertheless noticeably convergent on the species-specific song of another conifer-associated member of the carnea-group, C. downesi (Smith), from North America. The song of C. duellii also shows some superficial similarity to those of European/north African C. mediterranea (Hölzel) and southern Californian C. calocedrii Henry et al., both of which, like C. duellii, prefer conifers and exhibit dark-green adult body pigmentation. The new species is herein formally described as Chrysoperla duellii Henry, Taylor and Johnson and is shown to be diagnosable by song and morphology from all other known members of the Chrysoperla carnea-group. Results of restriction site-associated DNA sequencing (RADseq) of C. duellii and five other carnea-group species strongly reject the hypothesis that similar songs and dark-green body colour among the four conifer-associated species are due to common ancestry, instead supporting independent, parallel acquisition of such features.http://www.zoobank.org/urn:lsid:zoobank.org:pub:4CA5BE5F-B4B9-4A7D-A801-C9AE1E895D0B  aFunds for RAD sequencing and related molecular work were provided by (1) AFRI award no. 2017-67012-26785/project accession no.

This calls for exploration and integration of novel restoration techniques and tools, such as the “gardening” concept. The gardening approach, which has been successfully applied in various reef sites worldwide, is based on farming coral stocks in mid-water nurseries. To date, the farming of asexually produced coral material has chiefly been studied. Here, we test the performance of a novel spat-stocking tool for planulae of Stylophora pistillata, a brooding coral species. Two prototypes of a new settlement apparatus and one original apparatus made of Petri dishes lined with preconditioned transparency (Mailer's paper) disks had been stocked with >3730 planulae. After 96h, only 95.3% of >2080 settlers were found on the Mailer paper provided. One-month-old survivors (80.8% of initial settlements) that were kept ex situ in a flow through seawater table were detached from the papers, “transglued” onto plastic pins, and transferred to mid-water coral nursery, where the trays were covered with fitted plastic nets (1cm² mesh) to prevent predation and detachment. Four months later, more than 89% survivorship was documented, with colonies starting to form 3D structures. We estimate that 676 person-hours would be required to create 10,000 5-month-old genotypes of equal size to small branch fragments. This novel methodology allows farming of large quantities of colonies originating from sexually produced planulae and may enhance local populations' genetic variability within a short period. This method is inexpensive and easy to perform in remote places for incorporation in coral reef management practices.  aPublisher supplied data 3acoral reefs 3acorals 3afarming systems 3agardening 3agenetic variation 3agenotype 3ahabitat conservation 3alarvae 3apaper 3apredation 3aprototypes 3aseawater 3asurvival rate 3atrays1 aRinkevich, B.0 tJournal of experimental marine biology and ecology.g2011 Feb. 28, v. 398, no. 1-2 p.40-46dElsevier B.V.x0022-09817nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jembe.2010.12.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03016naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002000140245008200160300001800242500001900260520170400279592002801983650001402011650002802025650001702053650001502070650002502085650001302110650001402123650002202137650001002159650001302169650000902182650000902191650001402200700002002214700001702234700002202251700002502273700002402298700002602322773012702348856007402475852000902549655001202558IND60736260620221117234043.0210506e20210504xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073626062DNAL7 a10.1039/d1bm00032b2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSong, Young Hye10aDevelopment of novel apoptosis-assisted lung tissue decellularization methods  ap. 3485-3498.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aDecellularized tissues hold great potential for both regenerative medicine and disease modeling applications. The acellular extracellular matrix (ECM)-enriched scaffolds can be recellularized with patient-derived cells prior to transplantation, or digested to create thermally-gelling ECM hydrogels for 3D cell culture. Current methods of decellularization clear cellular components using detergents, which can result in loss of ECM proteins and tissue architectural integrity. Recently, an alternative approach utilizing apoptosis to decellularize excised murine sciatic nerves resulted in superior ECM preservation, cell removal, and immune tolerance in vivo. However, this apoptosis-assisted decellularization approach has not been optimized for other tissues with a more complex geometry, such as lungs. To this end, we developed an apoptosis-assisted lung tissue decellularization method using a combination of camptothecin and sulfobetaine-10 (SB-10) to induce apoptosis and facilitate gentle and effective removal of cell debris, respectively. Importantly, combination of the two agents resulted in superior cell removal and ECM preservation compared to either of the treatments alone, presumably because of pulmonary surfactants. In addition, our method was superior in cell removal compared to a previously established detergent-based decellularization protocol. Furthermore, thermally-gelling lung ECM hydrogels supported high viability of rat lung epithelial cells for up to 2 weeks in culture. This work demonstrates that apoptosis-based lung tissue decellularization is a superior technique that warrants further utilization for both regenerative medicine and disease modeling purposes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aapoptosis 3abiocompatible materials 3acell culture 3aepithelium 3aextracellular matrix 3ageometry 3ahydrogels 3aimmunosuppression 3alungs 3amedicine 3amice 3arats 3aviability1 aMaynes, Mark A.1 aHlavac, Nora1 aVisosevic, Daniel1 aDaramola, Kaitlyn O.1 aPorvasnik, Stacy L.1 aSchmidt, Christine E.0 tBiomaterials science.g2021 May 4, v. 9, no. 9 p.3485-3498dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26911x2047-48497nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d1bm00032b3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03677naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100001500166245015800181300001600339520223100355592002802586650001902614650001202633650001502645650000902660650002402669650002202693650002002715650001202735650001202747650000902759650001502768650001002783653001402793653003002807653001902837653002002856653002102876700002002897700001802917700001502935700001502950700001602965773011102981856008203092852000903174655001203183IND60516140220221120061907.0190804e201504  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051614022DNAL7 a254711492pmid7 a10.1017/S17517311140029482doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCrosse, M.10aUsing post-grazing sward height to impose dietary restrictions of varying duration in early lactation: its effects on spring-calving dairy cow production  ap. 592-603.  aThe objective of this study was to investigate the immediate and carryover effects of imposing two post-grazing sward heights (PGSH) for varying duration during early lactation on sward characteristics and dairy cow production. The experiment was a randomised block design with a 2×2 factorial arrangement of treatments. A total of 80 spring-calving (mean calving date – 6 February) dairy cows were randomly assigned, pre-calving, to one of the two (n=40) PGSH treatments – S (2.7 cm) and M (3.5 cm) – from 13 February to 18 March, 2012 (P1). For the subsequent 5-week period (P2: 19 March to 22 April, 2012), half the animals from each P1 treatment remained on their treatment, whereas the other half of the animals switched to the opposing treatment. Following P2, all cows were managed similarly for the remainder of the lactation (P3: 23 April to 4 November, 2012) to measure the carryover effect. Milk production, BW and body condition score were measured weekly, and grass dry matter intake (GDMI) was measured on four occasions – approximately weeks 5, 10, 15 and 20 of lactation. Sward utilisation (above 2.7 cm; P1 and P2) was significantly improved by reducing the PGSH from 3.5 (0.83) to 2.7 cm (0.96). There was no effect of PGSH on cumulative annual grass dry matter (DM) production (15.3 t DM/ha). Grazing to 2.7 cm reduced GDMI by 1.7 and 0.8 kg DM/cow in P1 and P2, respectively, when compared with 3.5 cm (13.3 and 14.0 kg/cow per day, respectively). Cows grazing to 2.7 cm for both P1 and P2 (SS) tended to have reduced cumulative 10-week milk yield (−105 kg) and milk solids yield (−9 kg) when compared with cows grazing to 3.5 cm for both periods (MM; 1608 and 128 kg/cow, respectively). Treatments that alternated PGSH at the end of P1, SM and MS had intermediate results. There was no interaction between P1 and P2 treatments. There was also no carryover effect of early lactation grazing regime on milk and milk solids production in P3, given the reduction in early lactation milk yield. The results indicate that the diet of dairy cows should not be restricted by imposing a severe PGSH for all of the first 10 weeks of lactation, cows should graze to 3.5 cm for at least 5 of these weeks.  aPublisher supplied data 3abody condition 3acalving 3adairy cows 3adiet 3adietary restriction 3adry matter intake 3aearly lactation 3agrasses 3agrazing 3amilk 3amilk yield 3asward 0adairy cow 0apost-grazing sward height 0afeeding regime 0aearly lactation 0acarryover effect1 aO’Donovan, M.1 aBoland, T.

Standardized sampling procedures for its worldwide characterization are lacking as yet, affecting meaningful comparisons between regional situations. Mesh sizes in use vary greatly among studies, raising the possibility that sampling method bias results for size-related phenomena of the plankton, such as abundance and diversity in space and time. We tested the effects of different mesh sizes for sampling on the resulting size-frequency distributions of mesozooplankton by collecting copepod assemblages in the northern South China Sea. Sample retrieval by different mesh-size plankton nets were compared, using the abundance and distribution patterns of mesozooplankton collected with NORPAC zooplankton nets of 333, 200, and 100-μm mesh size. One-way ANOVA results for species number and richness indices of all samples showed significant differences between these three mesh size nets. In contrast, total copepod abundance of the 100-μm net was significantly higher than that from the 200-μm net (p=0.001) and of the 333-μm net (p<0.001). Index values of evenness and diversity were significantly different among the copepod assemblages obtained from the three mesh size nets. The evenness index values of the 100-μm net were significantly lower than those recorded from the 200-μm net (p=0.007) and the 333-μm net (p<0.001). The Shannon–Wiener diversity index of the 333-μm net was significantly higher than for the 200-μm net (p=0.016) and for the 100-μm net (p=0.006). In addition, the dominant species proportion in each copepod assemblage obtained in the three mesh size nets differed significantly. Densities of smaller mesozooplanktons such as copepodites were highly underestimated by larger meshed nets that were commonly used in previous studies in the waters of the North Pacific Ocean. Samples collected with a 100-μm mesh net demonstrated the numerical importance of smaller mesozooplankton in the northern South China Sea. Present results, therefore, suggest a striking selectivity of plankton net mesh sizes that significantly affected qualitative and quantitative aspects of copepod assemblages.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCopepoda 3aanalysis of variance 3aaquatic food webs 3abiogeochemical cycles 3asampling 3aspace and time 3aspecies diversity 3azooplankton 3aPacific Ocean 3aSouth China Sea1 aDahms, Hans-Uwe1 aHung, Jia-Jang1 aChen, Qing-Chao1 aHwang, Jiang-Shiou0 tJournal of experimental marine biology and ecology.g2011 Feb. 28, v. 398, no. 1-2 p.47-55dElsevier B.V.x0022-09817nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jembe.2010.12.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03855naa a2200913 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002800150245011200178300001600290500001900306520149900325592002801824650001801852650001501870650001601885650001501901650001601916650001701932650001701949650002001966650001201986650002301998650001302021650001902034650002002053650001902073653000902092653000902101653000802110653001002118653001102128653000902139653000902148653000802157653000802165653000702173653000802180653000802188653001002196653001202206653000702218653000702225653000902232653000902241653000802250653000802258653000802266653000702274653000902281653000802290653003202298653001902330653001102349653001102360653001102371653001402382653001602396653003102412700002602443700002102469700002502490700002702515700002902542700002602571700002402597700002202621700002302643700002802666700002402694700002502718773009302743856008402836852000902920655001202929IND60693708220221119095909.0200508s2019    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069370822DNAL7 a10.1016/j.toxrep.2019.04.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMamoulakis, Charalampos10aContrast-induced nephropathy in an animal model: Evaluation of novel biomarkers in blood and tissue samples  ap. 395-400.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aIdentification of novel biomarkers of contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN) that may more accurately detect renal function changes; reflect kidney damage; assist monitoring; and elucidate pathophysiology attract considerable scientific attention nowadays. To evaluate novel biomarkers of nephrotoxicity in blood/tissue samples of a CIN model, 10 New Zealand white rabbits were divided into group 1 (n = 5; iopromide) and group 2 (n = 5; control). Blood was drawn at 0 h (immediately), 24 h and 48 h after contrast medium (CM) administration. Animals were euthanized at 48 h and kidneys were removed. Serum creatinine (sCr)/symmetric-asymmetric dimethylarginine (SDMA-ADMA) levels were measured. CM genotoxic/cytotoxic effect was investigated 48 h post-CM exposure using micronucleus assay in lymphocytes. Cytological examination was conducted using touch preparation technique (TPT). All animals in group 1 developed CIN: mean sCr levels increased by 68.2% within 48 h. Significant SDMA-ADMA level elevation was observed at 0 h and 24 h with insignificant drop at 48 h in group 1, remaining normal in group 2 at all time-points.

The aim of this work is to delineate wetlands habitat vulnerability of the wetlands in Punarbhaba river basin for pre and post dam state by taking into consideration of seven influencing indicators of Pressure-State-Response model. Analytical hierarchy process (AHP)-based fuzzy logic model has been employed for producing wetlands habitat vulnerability for both pre (up to1992) and post dam (1993-present). From the produced models, out of total wetland area (222.72 km²), 9.55% and 6.47% area are under high and very high wetland habitat vulnerable zones in pre dam phases but those vulnerable area are boosted to 27.25% and 28.13% in post dam period (total wetland area: 114.72 km²). The leading vectors for growing wetlands habitat vulnerability are amplification of agriculture land, shrinking of active flood plain, lessening of flood frequency.  aPublisher supplied data 3adams (hydrology) 3afloodplains 3afuzzy logic 3ahabitats 3awatersheds 3awetlands 0aWetland degradation 0awetland habitat vulnerability 0aactive flood plain and extensions of agricultural land1 aPal, Swades0 tGeocarto international.g2020 June 10, v. 35, no. 8 p.857-886dTaylor & FranciswJournal:12366x1752-07627nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10106049.2018.15335943Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01989naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245014300169300001600312520098000328592002801308650001301336650001001349650001801359650001501377650001501392650000901407650002201416650001001438700002401448700002001472773010201492856004801594852000901642655001201651IND50063139620221119211328.0130324e201303  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006313962DNAL7 a10.1007/s00226-012-0487-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aForsthuber, Boris10aEvaluation of the photo stabilising efficiency of clear coatings comprising organic UV absorbers and mineral UV screeners on wood surfaces  ap. 281-297.  aA study of the surface discolouration of clear coated wood during artificial and outdoor weathering and its prevention using clear coatings comprising organic UV absorbers (UVA) and mineral UV screeners was carried out. It was shown that the use of UVA and UV screeners in clear coatings was very effective in reducing photodegradation of the wood surface. Preliminary irradiation trials with Xenon arc light showed that the UV screener TiO₂ led to the least discolouration of the coated wood surface, closely followed by UVA of the hydroxyphenyl-s-triazine class (HPT). The artificial and outdoor weathering trials indicated that UVA of the HPT class stabilised the colour of the wood surface better than UVA of the 2-(2-hydroxyphenyl)-benzotriazole class (BTZ). Comparison of different artificial weathering methods indicated that Xenon arc light weathering showed the best match to the proceeding discolouration of the clear coated wood panels during outdoor weathering.  aPublisher supplied data 3acoatings 3acolor 3adiscoloration 3aphotolysis 3aweathering 3awood 3awood-based panels 3axenon1 aSchaller, Christian1 aGrüll, Gerhard0 tWood science and technology.g2013 Mar., v. 47, no. 2 p.281-297dSpringer-Verlagx0043-77197nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00226-012-0487-6  aDNAL 7aarticle02943naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002400149245010200173300001600275506007600291520140100367592002801768506003701796650001901833650001601852650002401868650001901892650001801911650002101929650002501950653001201975653002501987653001902012653002202031653001102053653002002064700002102084700002102105700002002126700002002146700001802166700001802184700002002202700002102222773011302243856008402356852000902440655001202449IND60556403020221207133232.0220517e20170615xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055640302DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ydbio.2016.07.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHaramoto, Yoshikazu10aIdentification and comparative analyses of Siamois cluster genes in Xenopus laevis and tropicalis  ap. 374-383.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aTwo siamois-related homeobox genes siamois (sia1) and twin (sia2), have been reported in Xenopus laevis. These genes are expressed in the blastula chordin- and noggin-expressing (BCNE) center and the Nieuwkoop center, and have complete secondary axis-inducing activity when over-expressed on the ventral side of the embryo. Using whole genome sequences of X. tropicalis and X. laevis, we identified two additional siamois-related genes, which are tandemly duplicated near sia1 and sia2 to form the siamois gene cluster. Four siamois genes in X. tropicalis are transcribed at blastula to gastrula stages. In X. laevis, the siamois gene cluster is present on both homeologous chromosomes, XLA3L and XLA3S. Transcripts from seven siamois genes (three on XLA3L and four on XLA3S) in X. laevis were detected at blastula to gastrula stages. A transcribed gene, sia1p. S, encodes an inactive protein without a homeodomain. When over-expressed ventrally, all siamois-related genes tested in this study except for sia1p. S induced a complete secondary axis, indicating that X. tropicalis and X. laevis have four and six active siamois-related genes, respectively. Of note, each gene required different amounts of mRNA for full activity. These results suggest the possibility that siamois cluster genes have functional redundancy to endow robustness and quickness to organizer formation in Xenopus species.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aXenopus laevis 3achromosomes 3agene overexpression 3ahomeotic genes 3amessenger RNA 3amultigene family 3anucleotide sequences 0aXenopus 0aSiamois-related gene 0aSecondary axis 0aEarly development 0aGenome 0aWnt/β--catenin1 aSaijyo, Tomohito1 aTanaka, Toshiaki1 aFuruno, Nobuaki1 aSuzuki, Atsushi1 aItō, Yuzuru,1 aKondo, Mariko1 aTaira, Masanori1 aTakahashi, Shuji0 tDevelopmental biology.g2017 June 15, v. 426, no. 2 p.374-383dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12382x0012-16067nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ydbio.2016.07.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02563naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245012600158300002000284520119700304592002801501650001801529650002001547650001301567650002101580650002801601650001201629650000901641650001901650650001101669650001401680650001301694650001401707650003301721650000901754650001401763650001001777650001601787700002301803700001701826700002201843700001801865773012601883856007502009852000902084655001202093IND60794468620221121054550.0220923e20220907xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079446862DNAL7 a10.1039/d2ra03782c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSafitri, Hana10aOptimization of uric acid detection with Au nanorod-decorated graphene oxide (GO/AuNR) using response surface methodology  ap. 25269-25278.  aA modified glassy carbon electrode (GCE) was developed based on a synthesized graphene oxide (GO) gold nanorod (AuNR) decorated composite (GO/AuNR) for sensitive electrochemical sensing of uric acid (UA). The electrochemical performance of GO/AuNR/GCE for UA detection was investigated employing the differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) technique. Central composite design (CCD) was applied to obtain the optimum composition of the GO and AuNR composite, which provide the highest possible UA oxidation peak current. The optimum composition was obtained at a GO concentration of 5 mg mL⁻¹ and AuNR volume of 10 mL. Under the optimum conditions, GO/AuNR/GCE showed acceptable analytical performance for UA detection with good linearity (concentration range of 10–90 μM) and both a low detection limit (0.4 μM) and quantitation limit (1.0 μM). Furthermore, the proposed sensor exhibits superior stability, reproducibility, and selectivity using ascorbic acid (AA), dopamine (DA), urea, glucose, and magnesium as interferents. Finally, practical use of GO/AuNR/GCE was demonstrated by successfully determining the content of UA in human urine samples with the standard addition approach.  aPublisher supplied data 3aascorbic acid 3adetection limit 3adopamine 3aelectrochemistry 3aglassy carbon electrode 3aglucose 3agold 3agraphene oxide 3ahumans 3amagnesium 3ananorods 3aoxidation 3aresponse surface methodology 3aurea 3auric acid 3aurine 3avoltammetry1 aWahyuni, Wulan Tri1 aRohaeti, Eti1 aKhalil, Moenawar,1 aMarken, Frank0 tRSC advances.g2022 Sept. 07, v. 12, no. 39 p.25269-25278dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d2ra03782c3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02116naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002400150245013800174300001600312520066600328592002800994650002101022650002901043650001701072650002401089650001501113650002101128650001001149650002201159650002701181650001101208653001801219653001901237653000901256653002201265653002901287653002701316700002001343700001901363700002201382773017201404856008501576852000901661655001201670IND60527029920221119083655.0180904e201603  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052702992DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jbiosc.2015.06.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMiyakoshi, Shunichi10aImproved conversion of cinnamaldehyde derivatives to diol compounds via a pyruvate decarboxylase-dependent mechanism in budding yeast  ap. 265-267.  aCinnamaldehyde is stereospecifically converted to (2S,3R) 5-phenylpent-4-ene-2,3-diol, an important starting material for the synthesis of biologically active compounds, by the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae.

The emergence of multi-and extensively-drug resistant (MDR and XDR) Mycobacterium tuberculosis clinical strains further pinpoint the urgent need for new anti-tuberculous drugs. We previously showed that vancomycin can target mycobacteria lacking cell wall integrity, especially those lacking related phthiocerol and phthiodolone dimycocerosates, PDIM A and PDIM B, respectively. As aloe emodin was previously hypothesized to be able to target the synthesis of mycobacterial cell wall lipids, we tested its ability to potentiate glycopeptides antimycobacterial activity. The aloe emodin with the vancomycin induced a combination effect beyond simple addition, close to synergism, at a concentration lower to reported IC₅₀ cytotoxic value, on M. bovis BCG and on H37Rv M. tuberculosis. Interestingly, out of six MDR and pre-XDR clinical strains, one showed a strong synergic susceptibility to the drug combination. Mycobacterial cell wall lipid analyses highlighted a selective reduction of PDIM B by aloe emodin.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAloe 3aMycobacterium tuberculosis 3aantibacterial properties 3acell walls 3acytotoxicity 3adrugs 3aemodin 3aglycopeptides 3ainhibitory concentration 50 3alipids 3apublic health 3asynergism 3atuberculosis 3avancomycin1 aCeyssens, Pieter-Jan1 aLaval, Françoise1 aLefèvre, Philippe,1 aMathys, Vanessa1 aDaffé, Mamadou,1 aFontaine, Véronique,1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7588-54620 tIndian journal of microbiology.g2018 Sept., v. 58, no. 3 p.393-396dSpringer IndiawJournal:jnl14369x0046-89917nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12088-018-0734-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02361naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002100139245008500160500001900245520118500264592002801449650001001477650002301487650002301510650001601533650001501549650001501564650002201579650000901601650001601610650001001626650002301636650001701659650002001676651001801696700001501714700002101729773011901750856007301869852000901942655001201951IND60729510420221119200602.0210228e20210223xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072951042DNAL7 a10.3390/w130405722doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHamamoto, Shogo 10aAssessment of Renewal Priority of Water Pipeline Network against Earthquake Risk  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aLong-term outage of drinking water supply after earthquakes has large adverse impacts on the lives of residents and cities’ water supply systems. Priority assessment is required to determine the effective order of preparing the measures against these hazards. Previous studies have insufficiently focused on the effects of seismic resistance of core pipelines, thereby affecting all the other branched pipelines that supply the water to each residential area. In our research, we aimed to propose the appropriate order of core pipelines derived from the center of the water treatment plants in Osaka, Japan against the Nankai Trough earthquake. Solutions that cause less damage have been needed because natural disaster prediction has had a lot of uncertainty. We proposed indices that can evaluate an appropriate renewal plan that considers the damage of core pipelines of water and the renewal cost for core pipeline networks based on the scenario analysis and the Monte Carlo simulation. The amount of water distribution of core pipelines in each area is the top priority when renewing them in terms of cost-effectiveness and expected rate of water outage under the disaster.  aPublisher supplied data 3aJapan 3aMonte Carlo method 3acost effectiveness 3aearthquakes 3ageophysics 3aprediction 3aresidential areas 3arisk 3auncertainty 3awater 3awater distribution 3awater supply 3awater treatment 3aPacific Ocean1 aIto, Lisa 1 aTōkai, Akihiro,0 tWater.g2021 Feb. 23, v. 13, no. 4dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21688x2073-44417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w130405723Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02354naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004000111040001800151100001800169245012800187300001800315520111700333592002801450650002301478650002501501650001701526650001801543650001701561650002801578650001601606650004301622650001201665650002601677650001801703650001201721650001801733700001801751773009201769856008601861852000901947655001201956IND4448723720221123002959.0141111e20110615xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444872372DNAL7 a252139392pmid7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2010.12.0472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPradeep, S.R.10aEffect of processing methods on the nutraceutical and antioxidant properties of little millet (Panicum sumatrense) extracts  ap. 1643-1647.  aThe effect of germination, steaming and roasting on the nutraceutical and antioxidant properties of little millet (Panicum sumatrense) was investigated. The nutraceutical properties were determined by evaluating the total phenolic, flavonoid and tannin contents while the antioxidant properties were studied by the DPPH free radical scavenging activity and the iron reducing power assay. The results showed that the total phenolic, flavonoid and tannin contents of processed little millet increased by 21.2, 25.5 and 18.9mg/100g, respectively, compared to native sample. The DPPH radical scavenging activity and the iron reducing power of roasted millet extract were the highest compared to the other processed millet. Fractionation of phenolic extracts by HPLC showed that the analytes were derivatives of benzoic acid (gallic acid, proto-catechuic acid and vanillic acid), aromatic carboxylic acid (gentisic acid) and cinnamic acid (syringic acid and ferulic acid). The results indicate that processing has significant effects on the nutraceutical and antioxidant properties of little millet phenolic extracts.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPanicum sumatrense 3aantioxidant activity 3abenzoic acid 3acinnamic acid 3aferulic acid 3afree radical scavengers 3agallic acid 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3amillets 3aprocessing technology 3asyringic acid 3atannins 3avanillic acid1 aGuha, Manisha0 tFood chemistry.g2011 June 15, v. 126, no. 4 p.1643-1647dElsevier Ltdx0308-81467nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2010.12.0473Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02087naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002400143245012200167300001400289520062300303592002800926650001300954650001100967650002500978650001501003650001001018650000901028650003001037650001601067650001701083650001101100651001801111653003001129653002201159653001901181653002301200700002501223700002401248700001801272700002301290700001901313700002401332700002601356773013501382856007901517852000901596655001201605IND60131778220221119175713.0151127e201503  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013177822DNAL7 a10.1638/2012-0248R2.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMcBride, Michael P.10aOphidiomyces ophiodiicola dermatitis in eight free-ranging timber rattlesnakes (crotalus horridus) from massachusetts  ap. 86-94.  aEight free-ranging timber rattlesnakes (Crotalus horridus) from two geographically isolated Massachusetts populations were observed with skin lesions located primarily on the head but occasionally also on the lateral and ventral surfaces of the body.

There were associations between total, native and endemic plant species richness in all four Pacific dry forest regions but we found no significant association with the presence or density of species listed on the IUCN Red List. Dry forests in New Caledonia and Hawaii merit the highest conservation priority in the Pacific, based on level of endemism and number of threatened species. The study sites that merit high conservation priority are Metzdorf, Nekoro and Pindai, in New Caledonia, Kokee and Kaupulehu, in Hawaii, and Vatia, in Fiji. New Caledonia and Fiji have a small dry forest extent and protected area extent compared with other dry forests in biodiversity hotspots. Although we identified priority areas for dry forest conservation, more comparative plot data, presence/absence data in fragments and regional geographical data are needed to adequately manage and protect dry forests in the Pacific.  aPublisher supplied data 3adry forests 3aindigenous species 3aspecies diversity 3athreatened species 3awoody plants 3aFiji 3aHawaii 3aNew Caledonia 0aBiodiversity hotspots 0adry forest 0ageographical information system 0aIUCN Red List 0aPacific 0aspecies richness1 aO'Neill, Kristin1 aKeppel, Gunnar1 aPau, Stephanie1 aMeyer, J.-Y.q(Jean-Yves),1 aPrice, Jonathan P.1 aJaffré, Tanguy,0 tOryx.g2014 July, v. 48, no. 3 p.337-344dCambridge University PresswJournal:1955x1365-30087nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S00306053130002643Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02657naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100002900188245013500217300001600352506007600368520113000444592002801574506003701602650003501639650002901674650002201703650001701725650001301742650002101755650001601776650001201792650002201804700002401826700002401850700002401874700003001898700002501928700002401953700002801977773010402005856008102109852000902190655001202199IND60449338920221207135751.0151031e201512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6044933892DNAL7 a10.1007/s12088-015-0537-52doi7 aPMC46279572pmcid7 a265432702pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDzhavakhiya, Vakhtang V.10aStrain Improvement of Streptomyces xanthochromogenes RIA 1098 for Enhanced Pravastatin Production at High Compactin Concentrations  ap. 440-446.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aPravastatin is one of the most popular cholesterol-lowering drugs. Its industrial production represents a two-stage process including the microbial production of compactin and its further biocatalytic conversion to pravastatin. To increase a conversion rate, a higher compactin content in fermentation medium should be used; however, high compactin concentrations inhibit microbial growth. Therefore, the improvement of the compactin resistance of a producer still remains a relevant problem. A multi-step random UV mutagenesis of a Streptomyces xanthochromogenes strain RIA 1098 and the further selection of high-yield compactin-resistant mutants have resulted in a highly productive compactin-resistant strain S 33-1. After the fermentation medium improvement, the maximum bioconversion rate of this strain has reached 91 % at the daily compactin dose equal to 1 g/L and still remained high (83 %) even at the doubled dose (2 g/L). A 1-year study of the mutant strain stability has proved a stable inheritance of its characteristics that provides this strain to be very promising for the pravastatin-producing industry.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aStreptomyces xanthochromogenes 3aanticholesteremic agents 3abiotransformation 3afermentation 3aindustry 3amicrobial growth 3amutagenesis 3amutants 3aradioimmunoassays1 aVoinova, Tatiana M.1 aGlagoleva, Elena V.1 aPetukhov, Dmitry V.1 aOvchinnikov, Alexander I.1 aKartashov, Maksim I.1 aKuznetsov, Boris B.1 aSkryabin, Konstantin G.0 tIndian journal of microbiology.g2015 Dec., v. 55, no. 4 p.440-446dSpringer Indiax0046-89917nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12088-015-0537-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02232naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245004500164300001400209520109400223592002801317650002501345650002301370650002101393650002001414650001601434650001901450650001401469653001001483653001801493653002201511653003101533700001801564700002101582700002101603700001901624773010101643856008101744852000901825655001201834IND60604093520221118104508.0180716e20151010xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060409352DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tca.2015.08.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLomba, Laura10aThermophysical study of the furan family  ap. 54-64.  aThe dynamic viscosity, speed of sound, surface tension, density, refractive index, and static permittivity of furan, 2-methylfuran and 2,5-dimethylfuran have been obtained at temperatures from 278.15 to 338.15K under atmospheric pressure, although for furan the temperature range have been 278.15–303.15K.

Castro10aRelationships between odd- and branched-chain fatty acid profiles in milk and calculated enteric methane proportion for lactating dairy cattle  ap. 596-602.  aThe purpose of this study was to explore the relationships between odd- and branched-chain fatty acids (OBCFA) in milk with calculated enteric CH₄ production for lactating dairy cows using multiple linear regression (MLR), partial least squares regression (PLS) and a genetic algorithm approach (GA). A dataset collected from 13 experiments containing 224 paired observations of measured acetate, propionate and butyrate proportions in rumen fluid VFA and 7 measured OBCFA was used. Methane proportion (mmol/mol VFA) was calculated from acetate, propionate and butyrate and expressed relative to the sum of these volatile fatty acids (VFA). Calculated CH₄ production was related to milk OBCFA using MLR and PLS, resulting in a linear prediction model. The GA approach resulted in a model which predicted rumen VFA proportions of total VFA from milk OBCFA. Methane proportion was calculated from predicted acetate, propionate and butyrate proportions in total VFA based on rumen stoichiometry and compared with CH₄ proportion calculated from measured VFA proportions. The prediction error was low (i.e., root mean square prediction error <5%), and models captured up to 66% of the variance in the data and the concordance correlation coefficient was close to 0.8. The variance of the prediction error was less than 40% of the variance of the calculated CH₄ proportion. Seven milk OBCFA were initially considered as predictors, from which the branched-fatty acids iso C14:0, iso C15:0, iso C16:0 were positively related to calculated enteric CH₄ production and the odd-fatty acids C15:0 and the sum of C17:0 and C17:1 cis–9 were negatively related to it. Relationships in this large data set identify the most relevant OBCFA in milk as potential predictors of rumen methanogenesis.

In main plots, cropping systems, viz. CS₁—rice–wheat (R–W) and CS₂—sugarcane (plant crop)–ratoon–wheat (S–R–W) and subplots residue management practices, viz. residue removal (T₁-RR); residue burning (T₂-RB); residue incorporation (T₃-RI); residue incorporation + Trichoderma (T₄-RI + T), residue incorporation +25 % extra nitrogen application (T₅-RI + N), partial residue incorporation (T₆-PRI), partial residue incorporation + Trichoderma (T₇-PRI + T) and partial residue incorporation +25 % extra nitrogen application (T₈-PRI + N), were allocated. The observations on soil physical parameters indicated the lower mean bulk density (1.10 Mg m⁻³) in sugarcane–ratoon–wheat system than the rice–wheat system (1.145 Mg m⁻³). Increased porosity (58.68 %) was obtained in sugarcane–ratoon–wheat (S–R–W) system as compared to rice–wheat system (56.83 %). In S–R–W system, higher (19.51 %) SOC was recorded than the R–W system (16.31 Mg ha⁻¹) at 0–15 cm depth. After harvesting of wheat in both the cropping systems, higher total carbon sequestered (@1.42 Mg ha⁻¹) in S–R–W system than the R–W cropping system (0–15 cm soil depth). Higher contents of available nitrogen, phosphorous and potassium were recorded in S–R–W system than the R–W system after completion of crop cycle. The agronomic efficiency of rice, wheat and sugarcane crops indicated the higher level with residue incorporation along with Trichoderma application. Thus, it could be concluded that sugarcane–ratoon–wheat system acted as soil fertility restorer and crop reside management along with application of Trichoderma sustained the soil carbon level, crop productivity and agronomic/production efficiency of N for longer period.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTrichoderma viride 3abulk density 3aburning 3acarbon 3acarbon sequestration 3acrop residue management 3acrop yield 3acropping systems 3acrops 3afield experimentation 3aharvesting 3anitrogen 3aphosphorus 3aporosity 3apotassium 3arice 3asoil depth 3asoil fertility 3asugarcane 3awheat 3aIndia1 aShee, Swaha1 aMaity, S.

Quorum sensing (QS) is a cell-density dependent communication process that respond to the inter/intra-species signals and elicit responses to show behavioral changes in the bacteria to an aggressive forms. In accordance to this phenomenon, the S. mutans also harbors a Competing Stimulating Peptide (CSP)-mediated quorum sensing, ComCDE (Two-component regulatory system) to regulate several virulence-associated traits that includes the formation of the oral biofilm (dental plaque), genetic competence and acidogenicity. The QS-mediated response of S. mutans adherence on tooth surface (dental plaque) imparts antibiotic resistance to the bacterium and further progresses to lead a chronic state, known as periodontitis. In recent years, the oral streptococci, S. mutans are not only recognized for its cariogenic potential but also well known to worsen the infective endocarditis due to its inherent ability to colonize and form biofilm on heart valves. The review significantly appreciate the increasing complexity of the CSP-mediated quorum-sensing pathway with a special emphasis to identify the plausible drug targets within the system for the development of anti-quorum drugs to control biofilm formation and associated risks.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aStreptococcus mutans 3aantibiotic resistance 3abacteria 3abehavior change 3abiofilm 3adental caries 3adrugs 3aendocarditis 3aheart valves 3ahumans 3aperiodontitis 3aquorum sensing 3arisk1 aRajesh, Shrinidhi1 aPrincy, S.

(Rubiaceae) has been shown by morphological and molecular analyses to be polyphyletic. Most of its species, including its type, belong to Palicourea Aubl. Some of its species have previously been transferred to Palicourea, and several more are studied and transferred here. The species studied here are classified in a newly circumscribed group that includes the type of Palicourea sect. Bracteiflorae Borhidi and so takes that name but differs in circumscription from it. This new circumscription of Palicourea sect Bracteiflorae includes 51 species of shrubs and small trees found in wet vegetation from southern Mexico and the Antilles to Brazil and Bolivia, and is diagnosed by a combination of stipule, inflorescence, and fruit characters. Its center of diversity is now in the Andean region. Twelve previously described species are newly transferred to Palicourea here, and analysis here clarifies the identity and circumscription of several of these. The 23 species newly described here are documented from Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru. The replacement name Palicourea palenquensis C. M. Taylor is published for the species originally described as Cephaelis gentryi Dwyer. The newly described section Palicourea sect. Egenses C. M. Taylor includes the species of Palicourea sect. Bracteiflorae sensu Borhidi that are excluded from the present circumscription of that section.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCephaelis 3aPalicourea 3aPsychotria 3abiological nomenclature 3acenter of diversity 3afruits 3anew species 3aplant taxonomy 3apolyphyly 3ashrubs 3atrees 3avegetation 3aAndes region 3aBolivia 3aBrazil 3aColombia 3aEcuador 3aMexico 3aPeru 0aBolivia 0aBrazil 0aColombia 0aCosta Rica 0aEcuador 0aPalicourea 0aPanama 0aPeru 0aPsychotria 0aRubiaceae 0aVenezuela0 tNovon.g2018, v. 26, no. 1 p.66-138dthe Missouri Botanical GardenwJournal:jnl3943564x1055-31777nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3417/20170363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02540naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002300139245016600162500001900328520138600347592002801733650001201761650001501773650002201788650000901810650000901819650001901828650001701847650001001864650000901874651001401883700002401897700002601921700001801947773011901965856007302084852000902157655001202166IND60729510920221119200744.0210228e20210223xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072951092DNAL7 a10.3390/w130405772doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAnderson, Carl  C.10aAssessing Multi-Hazard Vulnerability and Dynamic Coastal Flood Risk in the Mississippi Delta: The Global Delta Risk Index as a Social-Ecological Systems Approach  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe tight coupling of the social-ecological system (SES) of the Mississippi Delta calls for balanced natural hazard vulnerability and risk assessments. Most existing assessments have approached these components in isolation. To address this, we apply the Global Delta Risk Index (GDRI) in the Mississippi Delta at high-resolution census tract level. We assess SES spatial patterns of drought, hurricane-force wind, and coastal flood vulnerability and integrate hazard and exposure data for the assessment of coastal flood risk. Moreover, we compare current coastal flood risk to future risk in 2025 based on the modelled effects of flood depth, exposure, and changes in ecosystem area in the context of ongoing efforts under the 2017 Louisiana Coastal Master Plan. Results show that the Master Plan will lead to decreases in risk scores by 2025, but the tracts that are currently the most vulnerable benefit less from risk reduction efforts. Along with our index output, we discuss the need for further advancements in SES methodology and the potential for catastrophic hazard events beyond the model parameters, such as extreme rainfall events and very strong hurricanes. Assessing SES risk components can lead to more targeted policy recommendations, demonstrated by the need for Master Plan projects to consider their unequal spatial effects on vulnerability and risk reduction.  aPublisher supplied data 3adrought 3aecosystems 3aissues and policy 3arain 3arisk 3arisk reduction 3ariver deltas 3awater 3awind 3aLouisiana1 aRenaud, Fabrice G.,1 aHagenlocher, Michael 1 aDay, John  W.0 tWater.g2021 Feb. 23, v. 13, no. 4dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21688x2073-44417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w130405773Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01596naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100002000137245008600157300001200243520052500255592002800780650001700808650002800825650001200853650001100865650001100876650001600887650001900903651001100922653001200933653001100945653001700956653001000973700002200983700001901005773010501024856007201129852000901201655001201210IND60594553320221116173500.0180625s2018    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059455332DNAL7 a10.3417/20170432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBarrie, Fred R.12aA New Species of Alsobia (Gesneriaceae) from Belize, with a Synopsis of the Genus  ap. 1-8.  aAlsobia baroniae L.

Laboratory Experiments  ap. 3067-3089.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aResearch on the morphodynamics of bedrock rivers has primarily focused on bedrock incision, and little is known about the alluvial morphodynamics of rivers with exposed bedrock surfaces. More specifically, there is a lack of information on the morphodynamics of low slope bedrock reaches due to the recent recognition of such systems. Here, we present the results of laboratory experiments specifically designed to gain novel insight into flow resistances, flow hydrodynamics, and sediment transport processes in equilibrium partially exposed bedrock reaches transporting nonuniform sand as bed material in low slope areas. The experiments show that (1) downstream of a stable alluvial‐bedrock transition flow depth decreases in the streamwise direction, (2) bedform amplitude may decrease in the streamwise direction, and (3) stable patterns of downstream fining may form. Given the bedrock geometry, the water surface elevation at downstream boundary and the characteristics of the bedform regime in an alluvial channel subject to the same flow rate and sediment supply at equilibrium control bedform characteristics and sediment sorting patterns in the bedrock reach. When this distance is significantly smaller than the alluvial equilibrium flow depth or when the alluvial equilibrium bedform regime is close to the dune‐antidune transition, bedforms in the bedrock reach are closer to the dune‐antidune transition than at alluvial equilibrium with a consequent reduction in bedform amplitude. If the distance between the water level at the downstream boundary and the bedrock surface is close to the alluvial equilibrium flow depth and the alluvial equilibrium bedforms are well in the dune regime, a stable pattern of downstream fining can be expected. The comparisons between experimental and modeled sediment transport rates and equilibrium grain size distributions of the sediment further show that surface‐based bedload transport models derived for alluvial systems reasonably predict equilibrium sediment transport rates and bed surface size distributions in bedrock reaches if the presence of exposed bedrock is accounted for in terms of alluvial cover fraction.  aPublisher supplied data  cUniversity of South Carolina  aEAR 1250641cUnited States National Science Foundation 3abedload 3abedrock 3ageometry 3ageophysics 3ahydrodynamics 3aresearch 3asand 3asediment transport1 aHernández Moreira, R.1 aViparelli, E.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6733-96640 tJournal of geophysical research.g2019 Dec., v. 124, no. 12 p.3067-3089dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:27941x2169-90037nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2019JF0050583Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01649naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245005900168300001600227520056900243592002800812650001700840650003200857650000900889650002200898650002400920653001700944653001700961653002200978700001901000700001701019700003201036700002401068773010401092856008201196852000901278655001201287IND60517208120221121042014.0190729e201407  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051720812DNAL7 a10.1017/S00306053140000402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRedford, Kent H.10aSynthetic biology and the conservation of biodiversity  ap. 330-336.  aSynthetic biology is a broad and fast-moving field of innovation involving the design and construction of new biological parts, and the redesign of existing, natural biological systems to address real world problems.

Dissemination of the plasmid borne bla NDM₋₁ through horizontal gene transfer is a potential threat to the society. In this study, a rapid non-culture method for detecting NDM-1 positive bacteria was developed by Loop Mediated Isothermal Amplification (LAMP) of bla NDM₋₁ . Sensitivity of this method was found to be one femtogram of plasmid DNA, which translates into 2.6–25.8 copies depending on the size of the plasmid DNA. This method was applied to detect NDM-1 positive bacteria in 81 water samples that were collected from environmental and drinking water sources. NDM-1 positive bacteria were detected in three drinking water samples by LAMP but not by PCR. These three samples were collected from the water sources that were treated with chlorine for decontamination before public distribution. NDM-1 positive bacteria were not detected in lake water samples or in the samples that were collected from the water sources that were purified by reverse osmosis before public distribution. Detection of NDM-1 positive bacteria using LAMP was found to be safe, sensitive and rapid for screening large number of samples from diverse sources. This method could be developed as on-field detection kit by using fluorescent dyes to visualize the amplified bla NDM₋₁ gene.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abacteria 3abeta-lactam antibiotics 3abeta-lactams 3achlorine 3adecontamination 3adrinking water 3afluorescent dyes 3agenes 3ahorizontal gene transfer 3alakes 3aplasmids 3apolymerase chain reaction 3arapid methods 3areverse osmosis 3ascreening 3asociety 3atranslation (genetics) 3aIndia1 aHiremath, Deepak S.1 aArunraj, Rex1 aParani, M.0 tIndian journal of microbiology.g2015 Dec., v. 55, no. 4 p.400-405dSpringer Indiax0046-89917nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12088-015-0540-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01525naa a2200241 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002400075024005100099040001800150100001900168245007300187300001600260500000900276520069300285592002800978650001901006650001901025773012001044852000901164856009801173655001201271991581457710742620221120092300.0191122e197505  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aCAIN7590693582DNAL7 a10.2135/cropsci1975.0011183X001500030012x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLippert, L.

The model overcomes the typical difficulties in estimating infiltration and evapotranspiration parameters using a modified version of the Soil Conservation Service curve number SCS-CN method. In addition, the model simulates the surface and groundwater hydrograph components using the response unit-hydrograph approach instead of using a linear reservoir routing approach for routing surface and groundwater to the basin outlet. The unit-responses are Geographic Information Systems (GIS)-pre-calculated on a semi-distributed short-term basis and applied in the simulation in every time step. The unit responses are based on the time-area technique that can better simulate the real routing behavior of the basin. The model is less sensitive to groundwater infiltration parameters since groundwater is actually controlled by the surface component and not the opposite. For that reason, the model is called the SCHydro model (Surface Controlled Hydrologic model). The model is tested on the upper Blue Nile catchment area using 28 years daily river flow data set for calibration and validation. The results show that SCHydro model can simulate the long-term transforming behavior of the upper Blue Nile basin. Our initial assessment of the model indicates that the model is a promising tool for long-term river flow simulations, especially for long-term forecasting purposes due to its stability in performing the water balance.  aPublisher supplied data 3abasins 3acase studies 3adata collection 3aevapotranspiration 3ageographic information systems 3agroundwater 3ahydrograph 3ahydrologic models 3ariver flow 3arivers 3arunoff 3asoil conservation 3awatersheds1 aGad, Mohamed  A.1 aAmin, Doaa 0 tHydrology.g2019 Aug. 15, v. 6, no. 3dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27143x2306-53387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/hydrology60300693Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02942naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001900144245015700163300002000320520136300340592002801703650002401731650001401755650001301769650001801782650001301800650001501813650001101828650002201839650000901861650001301870650002501883650001501908653001501923653002801938653003301966653002301999653001602022700001302038700001902051700001802070700001902088700005602107700005602163773014202219856007802361852000902439655001202448IND60596089120221118011421.0180613e20180413xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059608912DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.8b023942doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Hsuan-An10aSingle-Crystal Antimonene Films Prepared by Molecular Beam Epitaxy: Selective Growth and Contact Resistance Reduction of the 2D Material Heterostructure  ap. 15058-15064.  aSingle-crystal antimonene flakes are observed on sapphire substrates after the postgrowth annealing procedure of amorphous antimony (Sb) droplets prepared by using molecular beam epitaxy at room temperature. The large wetting angles of the antimonene flakes to the sapphire substrate suggest that an alternate substrate should be adopted to obtain a continuous antimonene film. By using a bilayer MoS₂/sapphire sample as the new substrate, a continuous and single-crystal antimonene film is obtained at a low growth temperature of 200 °C. The results are consistent with the theoretical prediction of the lower interface energy between antimonene and MoS₂. The different interface energies of antimonene between sapphire and MoS₂ surfaces lead to the selective growth of antimonene only atop MoS₂ surfaces on a prepatterned MoS₂/sapphire substrate. With similar sheet resistance to graphene, it is possible to use antimonene as the contact metal of 2D material devices. Compared with Au/Ti electrodes, a specific contact resistance reduction up to 3 orders of magnitude is observed by using the multilayer antimonene as the contact metal to MoS₂. The lower contact resistance, the lower growth temperature, and the preferential growth to other 2D materials have made antimonene a promising candidate as the contact metal for 2D material devices.  aPublisher supplied data 3aambient temperature 3aannealing 3aantimony 3acontact angle 3adroplets 3aelectrodes 3aenergy 3afilms (materials) 3agold 3agraphene 3amolybdenum disulfide 3aprediction 0aantimonene 0aconducting 2D materials 0a2D material heterostructures 0acontact resistance 0atransistors1 aSun, Xu,1 aWu, Chong-Rong1 aWang, Yu-Xuan1 aLee, Po-Hsiang1 aPao, Chun-Wei1http://orcid.org/0000-0003-0821-78561 aLin, Shih-Yen1http://orcid.org/0000-0001-7028-481X0 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2018 Apr. 13, v. 10, no. 17 p.15058-15064dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.8b023943Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02988naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002400146245010400170520203600274592002802310650001702338650002202355650002102377650001302398650002402411650000902435650001202444700001902456773012202475856008002597852000902677655001202686IND60670085920221123035435.0190925e20190817xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067008592DNAL7 a10.3390/hydrology60300712doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMeshkabadi, Kambiz 14aThe Effects of Grout Curtain Parameters on Uplift and Piping Phenomenon; Case Study: Sattarkhan Dam  aDesign of earth dams and their issues during and after construction is very important for residents downstream of the dam because of the potential risks and possible breakdowns. In the design of dams, various forces influence the dam body, including uplift pressure and piping phenomenon which should be considered in order to ensure the safety of the dam. Among the measures taken to prevent the washing away phenomenon, the reduction of the output gradient, and the leakage discharge from beneath the hydraulic structures, construction of the grout curtain and installation of the drainage are applicable. Therefore, in order to investigate the effect of various parameters such as the gradient angle of the grout curtain, length, and distance and the number of grout curtains, as well as the length of the drainage on the pressure and output gradient of the numerical models, were considered in current study. For this purpose, the SEEP/W software was used for modeling on Sattarkhan Dam as a case study. The results of the analysis showed that the use of the Qa&rsquo;im grout curtain at the upstream of the dam has the highest resistance against the pressure and piping phenomenon. The results also showed that increase in the length of the curtain of the water seal increases safety against uplift and piping phenomenon. The use of further spacing between the two grout curtains under the core of the dam led to increase in overall pressure or reduction in safety against uplift pressure. Increase in the length of the horizontal drainage reduced the effects of uplift pressure and output gradient. Results show that period of 70 to 110 degree is appropriate for curtain angle and setting curtain in upstream of dam core with angle of 70 to 80 degree is optimum and economic. A length of 30 m is optimum for curtain. The number of 2 curtains is also optimum. Studying various scenarios of distance of 2 curtains in dam core indicates that distance of 6 m is optimum and also length of 18 m for horizontal drainage is optimum.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase studies 3acomputer software 3adams (hydrology) 3adrainage 3amathematical models 3arisk 3awashing1 aZandi, Yousef 0 tHydrology.g2019 Aug. 17, v. 6, no. 3dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27143x2306-53387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/hydrology60300713Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02635naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100006300150245013100213300001800344520145700362592002801819650001801847650001301865650001901878650002901897650002001926650002001946650001601966700006201982700005802044773011402102856008402216852000902300655001202309IND60698088720221123000924.0200609e20190607xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069808872DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.langmuir.9b002642doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEdalatpour, Mojtaba1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5032-162510aVariations of the Static Contact Angle of Ferrofluid Droplets on Solid Horizontal Surfaces in External Uniform Magnetic Fields  ap. 6314-6322.  aThe application of external uniform magnetic fields to ferrofluid droplets affects their magnetic order at the nanoscale as well as their shape at the macroscale, thus changing their contact angle with the surface. In this work, the effects of external uniform magnetic fields on the contact angles between different oil-based ferrofluid droplets and a handful of horizontal surfaces of varying wettability were studied. The contact angle is no longer constant around the ferrofluid droplet; rather, it varies in a rich yet predictable way. Droplets dispensed in the presence of the magnetic field on oleophobic surfaces adjust such that the contact angle increases at the front and back ends and decreases at the two perpendicular positions. The opposite behavior is reported for ferrofluid droplets on oleophilic surfaces. These direction-dependent changes in the contact angle can have a significant impact on the behavior of ferrofluid droplets on gradient surfaces where they can either diminish or enhance the surface tension gradient. Our work is fundamentally relevant to potential applications involving the controlled movement of ferrofluid droplets on surfaces like the lab-on-a-chip under the combined effects of a magnetic field and either a surface tension gradient or an electric field (i.e., electrowetting). It is important to understand how the two effects interact for the optimal utilization of these effects in future applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3acontact angle 3adroplets 3aelectric field 3alab-on-a-chip technology 3amagnetic fields 3asurface tension 3awettability1 aSommers, Andrew D.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4365-03641 aEid, Khalid F.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7617-34640 tLangmuir.g2019 June 07, v. 36, no. 22 p.6314-6322dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19170x1520-58277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.langmuir.9b002643Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01665naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005600150245010400206300001800310500001900328520069000347592002801037650001201065650001501077650001401092700001801106700001501124700001801139773011301157856008401270852000901354655001201363IND60698088820221122190110.0200609e20200513xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069808882DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.langmuir.9b039512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDai, Qingwen1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7422-425910aMigration of Liquid Bridges at the Interface of Spheres and Plates with an Imposed Thermal Gradient  ap. 6268-6276.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aIn this paper, we experimentally investigate the migration of liquid bridges at the interface of spheres and plates with an imposed thermal gradient.

Wild rice contains novel genes which can help in improving rice yield. Common wild rice Oryza rufipogon is a known source for enhanced photosynthesis and yield-related traits. We developed BC₂F₂:₃:₄ mapping populations using O. rufipogon IC309814 with high photosynthetic rate as donor, and elite cultivar MTU1010 as recurrent parent. Evaluation of 238 BC₂F₂ families for 13 yield-related traits and 208 BC₂F₂ families for seven photosynthesis-related physiological traits resulted in identification of significantly different lines which performed better than MTU1010 for various yield contributing traits. 49 QTLs were identified for 13 yield traits and 7 QTLs for photosynthesis-related traits in BC₂F₂. In addition, 34 QTLs in BC₂F₃ and 26 QTLs in BC₂F₄ were also detected for yield traits.11 common QTLs were identified in three consecutive generations and their trait-increasing alleles were derived from O. rufipogon. Significantly, one major effect common QTL qTGW3.1 for thousand grain weight with average phenotypic variance 8.1% and one novel QTL qBM7.1 for biomass were identified. Photosynthesis-related QTLs qPN9.1, qPN12.1, qPN12.2 qSPAD1.1 and qSPAD6.1 showed additive effect from O. rufipogon. A set of 145 CSSLs were identified in BC₂F₂ which together represented 87% of O. rufipogon genome. In addition, 87 of the 145 CSSLs were significantly different than MTU1010 for at least one trait. The major effect QTLs can be fine mapped for gene discovery. CSSLs developed in this study are a good source of novel alleles from O. rufipogon in the background of Cottondora Sannalu for rapid improvement of any trait in rice.  aPublisher supplied data  aF.No: Edn/27/4/NP/2012-HRDcIndian Council of Agricultural Research 3aOryza rufipogon 3aOryza sativa 3aadditive effect 3abackcrossing 3abiomass 3achromosomes 3acultivars 3agenes 3aphenotypic variation 3aphotosynthesis 3awild rice1 aBalakrishnan, Divya1 aSurapaneni, Malathi1 aAddanki, Krishnamraju1 aMesapogu, Sukumar1 aBeerelli, Kavitha1 aDesiraju, Subrahmanyam1 aVoleti, Sitapati Rao1 aNeelamraju, Sarla1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0072-21720 tPlanta.g2022 Oct., v. 256, no. 4 p.71-71dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl46291x0032-09357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00425-022-03983-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02467naa a2200253 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002400075024005100099040001800150100001900168245006400187300001600251500000900267520161400276592002801890650001901918650001901937700001801956773012001974852000902094856009802103655001202201991596923550742620221120210251.0191122e197505  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aCAIN7590693652DNAL7 a10.2135/cropsci1975.0011183X001500030019x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPaschal, E.

Merr.] hybrids with both adapted cultivars and exotic strains as parents. The experiment, conducted at West Lafayette, Ind. in 1971 and 1972, used a partial diallel mating design with 12 parents. There were three parents from each of the following origins; locally adapted cultivars or strains, Manchurian, Chinese, and Korean. Thirty different F₁ combinations were produced and, along with their parents, planted in a randomized, complete block design. Heterosis for yield was greater than that for any other character with a high-parent value of 8.0% averaged over both years. Twelve of the 30 hybrids outyielded the midparent. Number of pods/plant was the most heterotic of the yield components. Number of seeds/pod and seed size of the Fₗ's was with few exceptions, intermediate to parental values, as were maturity, height, lodging, and harvest index. Heterosis for plant weight was similar to that for yield, both in magnitude and in the hybrids expressing it. Significant GCA effects were found for all characters. SCA effects were significant for seed size, maturity, and height. The years × GCA interaction was significant for yield, number of pods/plant, maturity, lodging score, plant weight, and harvest index. Years × SCA were significant for ntunber of seeds/pod, maturity, lodging, and harvest index.  aPublisher supplied data 3aplant genetics 3aplant breeding1 aWilcox, J.

The photocatalytic CO₂ conversion reaction was applied to evaluate the photocatalytic behavior of this catalytic system, and the WOCN-20 wt % heterojunction displayed superior photocatalytic behavior under full spectrum light irradiation, which was 6.46 μmol·h–¹·g–¹ for CO and 3.97 μmol·h–¹·g–¹ for CH₄, respectively. Furthermore, in the near-infrared region, the composite photocatalysts also displayed excellent photocatalytic performance. A large number of characterizations and testing measures were carried out to study the components, morphology, and physicochemical properties of W₁₈O₄₉/g-C₃N₄ photocatalyst, which were helpful to exploring and understanding the reasons for the improvement of catalytic performance. The boosted activity resulted from the tight contact between W₁₈O₄₉ and g-C₃N₄ and the formation of a Z-scheme heterojunction. The local surface plasmonic resonance (LSPR) of W⁵⁺ also contributed to the realization of efficient photocatalysis under near-infrared light. The Z-scheme electron transport model could realize the efficient separation of light-induced e––h⁺ pairs and reduce the recombination rate, thereby boosting the CO₂ photocatalytic reduction process.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon dioxide 3aelectron transfer 3aenergy 3airradiation 3amodels 3aphotocatalysis 3aphotocatalysts1 aGuo, Rui-tang1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5646-50991 aYuan, Ye1 aJi, Xiang-yin1 aLin, Zhi-dong1 aGu, Jing-wen1 aPan, Wei-guo0 tEnergy & fuels.g2021 July 06, v. 35, no. 14 p.11468-11478dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23338x1520-50297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.energyfuels.1c012413Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02625naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002400147245010600171300001400277520119700291592002801488650002201516650001201538650002501550650001601575650001501591650001301606650002401619650002201643650004401665650001601709650002401725650002301749650001901772653001901791653001601810653001801826653001601844653001501860653002201875700001701897700001801914700002001932773010101952856008102053852000902134655001202143IND60604094320221118105322.0180716e20151220xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060409432DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tca.2015.08.0212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKondrat’ev, Yu.V.10aSublimation and thermal decomposition of ammonia borane: Competitive processes controlled by pressure  ap. 64-71.  aThermal behavior of ammonia borane BH3NH3 (AB) has been studied by calorimetry, tensimetry and mass spectrometry methods. It is shown, that depending on vapor pressure in the system two competitive processes are taking place at 357K. At atmospheric pressure thermal decomposition with hydrogen evolution is the dominant process: BH3NH3(s)=1/n (BH2NH2)n(s)+H2(g) (1). At low pressures (circa 4mTorr) the major process is endothermic sublimation of AB: BH3NH3(s)=BH3NH3(g) (2). At intermediate pressures both processes occur simultaneously. Enthalpies for the processes (1) and (2) have been determined by drop-calorimetry method: Δ(1)H357°=−24.8±2.3kJmol⁻¹ and ΔsubH357°(BH3NH3)=76.3±3.0kJmol⁻¹. Solid products after sublimation and decomposition have been characterized by IR and NMR spectroscopy; gaseous forms were studied by mass spectrometry. Activation energy of 94±11kJmol⁻¹ for the process (1) in range 327–351K was determined by static tensimetry method. Based on the analysis of available thermodynamic characteristics, new values for the standard formation enthalpy of solid AB −133.4±5.2kJmol⁻¹ and polyamidoborane −156.7±5.8kJmol⁻¹ are recommended.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactivation energy 3aammonia 3aatmospheric pressure 3acalorimetry 3aendothermy 3aenthalpy 3ahydrogen production 3amass spectrometry 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3asublimation 3athermal degradation 3athermal properties 3avapor pressure 0aAmmonia borane 0aSublimation 0aDecomposition 0aCalorimetry 0aTensimetry 0aMass spectrometry1 aButlak, A.V.1 aKazakov, I.V.1 aTimoshkin, A.Y.0 tThermochimica acta.g2015 Dec. 20, v. 622 p.64-71dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11747x0040-60317nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tca.2015.08.0213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02815naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002800145245009700173300001400270520175700284592002802041650001402069650001302083650002302096650000902119650002102128650002502149650001302174650001202187650001302199650001402212651001202226651001902238700002202257773010502279856004802384852000902432655001202441IND4465626020221122183342.0120815e201209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446562602DNAL7 a10.1007/s10641-011-9858-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAjemian, Matthew Joseph10aHabitat-specific feeding by cownose rays (Rhinoptera bonasus) of the northern Gulf of Mexico  ap. 79-97.  aPast studies have suggested that increases in cownose ray (Rhinoptera bonasus) abundance may pose problems for fisheries management due to their specialized diet of exploitable mollusks. However, more recent work has identified cownose rays as opportunistic generalists, consuming mainly non-commercial prey (e.g. soft-bodied invertebrates) most abundant in their locale. To better assess the generalist vs. specialist foraging behaviors of cownose rays, including their impact to commercial shellfish of the north-central Gulf of Mexico, we conducted gut content analysis on 201 individuals from coastal Alabama. Prey items were analyzed for frequency of occurrence and percent composition by weight, which were used to develop an index of importance. Our diet analysis indicated a minimal impact of cownose rays to exploitable shellfish species of coastal Alabama. Further, we observed important spatial and ontogenetic diet variability: adult diets were dominated by crustaceans along barrier islands and open waters of the Gulf of Mexico, whereas juvenile and young-of-the-year individuals almost exclusively consumed bivalves in riverine and estuarine areas. Individual cownose ray diets were primarily monotypic (54.3%) and appeared selective for amphipods (i.e. Haustorius sp.) when hyperabundant along gulf barrier islands and bivalves at estuarine sites regardless of ambient densities. While this study highlights the importance of locality in determining dietary composition of cownose rays, we do not suggest this species is opportunistic or completely mollusk-specialized. Alternatively, we propose cownose rays exhibit a continuum of foraging behaviors between specialization and generalization, depending on locale and prey availability.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAmphipoda 3aBivalvia 3aRhinoptera bonasus 3adiet 3adigestive system 3afisheries management 3aforaging 3aislands 3amolluscs 3ashellfish 3aAlabama 3aGulf of Mexico1 aPowers, Sean Paul0 tEnvironmental biology of fishes.g2012 Sept., v. 95, no. 1 p.79-97dSpringer-Verlagx0378-19097nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10641-011-9858-3  aDNAL 7aarticle02887naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001700139245012200156500001900278520162700297592002801924650002701952650002101979650002802000650001702028650001802045650004102063650001902104650001602123650002302139650001402162650001902176650001502195650001002210700002002220700001902240700001702259773011902276856007302395852000902468655001202477IND60729511620221119200640.0210228e20210204xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072951162DNAL7 a10.3390/w130404132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Jiaqi 10aElectrochemical/Peroxymonosulfate/NrGO-MnFe2O4 for Advanced Treatment of Landfill Leachate Nanofiltration Concentrate  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aA simple one-pot method was used to successfully embed manganese ferrite (MnFe₂O₄) nanoparticles on the nitrogen-doped reduced graphene oxide matrix (NrGO), which was used to activate peroxymonosulfate to treat the landfill leachate nanofiltration concentration (LLNC) with electrochemical enhancement. NrGO-MnFe₂O₄ and rGO-MnFe₂O₄ were characterized by various means. This indicates that nitrogen-doped could induce more graphene oxide (GO) spall and reduction to produce more active centers, and was favorable for uniformly loading MnFe₂O₄ particles. The comparison between electrochemical/peroxymonosulfate/NrGO-MnFe₂O₄ (EC/PMS/NrGO-MnFe₂O₄) system and different catalytic systems shows that electrochemical reaction, NrGO and MnFe₂O₄ can produce synergies, and the chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal rate of LLNC can reach 72.89% under the optimal conditions. The three-dimensional (3D-EEM) fluorescence spectrum shows that the system has a strong treatment effect on the macromolecules with intense fluorescence emission in LLNC, such as humic acid, and degrades into substances with weak or no fluorescence characteristics. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) indicates that the complex structure of refractory organic compounds can be simplified, while the simple small molecular organic compounds can be directly mineralized. The mechanism of catalytic degradation of the system was preliminarily discussed by the free radical quenching experiment. Therefore, the EC/PMS/NrGO-MnFe₂O₄ system has significant application potential in the treatment of refractory wastewater.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical oxygen demand 3aelectrochemistry 3aferrimagnetic materials 3afluorescence 3afree radicals 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3agraphene oxide 3ahumic acids 3alandfill leachates 3amanganese 3ananofiltration 3awastewater 3awater1 aHe, Zhengguang 1 aWang, Yuzhong 1 aLu, Manjing 0 tWater.g2021 Feb. 04, v. 13, no. 4dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21688x2073-44417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w130404133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03168naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001400147245014400161300001600305520202300321592002802344650002502372650001202397650002502409650002602434650001302460650001302473650001902486650002302505650002302528650000902551650002002560700001202580700001802592773009402610856008102704852000902785655001202794IND60575080820221116143232.0170728e201707  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057508082DNAL7 a10.1007/s11258-017-0729-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Shu10aMorphological plasticity in response to population density varies with soil conditions and growth stage in Abutilon theophrasti (Malvaceae)  ap. 785-797.  aThe complexity of plant response to density in nature has been recognized, but seldom interpreted, especially in the context of various abiotic environments or plant ontogeny. Our objective was to investigate whether and how soil conditions and plant growth stage affected plant responses to density in a variety of traits under field conditions. Abutilon theophrasti (annual species) was planted at low, medium, and high densities (13.4, 36, and 121 plants m⁻², respectively) under good or poor soil conditions and harvested 30, 50, or 70 days after seedling emergence. Responses of many traits to density varied with soil conditions and growth stages. Initially, leaf size, petiole angle, and stem diameter were decreased by high density in good soil, but not in poor soil. After 50 days, high density induced extra stem elongation and stem mass increment in both soil conditions; this was at the cost of biomass allocated to other organs in good soil. In contrast, in poor soil, high density decreased more morphological traits, with less effects on allocation patterns. At 70 days, there were decreases in more traits in response to density in poor soil, whereas most traits remained stable in good soil. Results demonstrated that density–plasticity was inherently complex, including multiple responsive trends within and among traits, and revealed that the ability of the plants to adapt to variation in density via responses of various modular traits has been underestimated. Soil conditions and growth stage may affect these responses, either directly through effects on plant size and competition strength, or indirectly through effects on strength of stem response. Contrasting stage-dependent plasticity to density under two soil conditions also revealed different growth strategies of plants in dealing with biotic environmental challenges. These findings highlighted the importance of considering roles of abiotic environmental factors and growth stage in modulating plasticity to biotic environments.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAbutilon theophrasti 3abiomass 3adevelopmental stages 3aenvironmental factors 3aontogeny 3apetioles 3aplant response 3apopulation density 3aseedling emergence 3asoil 3astem elongation1 aLi, Lei1 aZhou, Dao-Wei0 tPlant ecology.g2017 July, v. 218, no. 7 p.785-797dSpringer Netherlandsx1385-02377nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11258-017-0729-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02768naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245012300171520145700294592002801751650003301779650002401812650003201836650000901868650001401877650002601891650001301917650002401930650002001954653001201974653002001986653001902006653002102025653002402046700001702070700001602087700001802103700001602121773011402137856008602251852000902337655001202346IND60723394520221120220659.0211206e20210715xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072339452DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhazmat.2021.1250512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Shaoqing10aResponses of anammox process to elevated Fe(III) stress: Reactor performance, microbial community and functional genes  aThe aim of present study was to re-evaluate the impacts of elevated Fe(III) stress on anaerobic ammonium oxidation (anammox) process. The results indicated that long-term low concentration Fe(III) (5 and 10 mg/L) exposure significantly improved the nitrogen removal efficiency of anammox process, while high concentration Fe(III) (50 and 100 mg/L) significantly deteriorated the reactor performance. Batch assays showed that the specific anammox activity, heme c content and hydrazine dehydrogenase activity were significantly increased and decreased under low and high concentration Fe(III) exposure, respectively, indicating an enhancement and inhibition of anammox activity. Moreover, the presence of high concentration Fe(III) significantly shifted the anammox community structure. Ca. Brocadia was the predominant anammox genus, whose abundance decreased from 14.26% to 8.13% as Fe(III) concentration increased from 0 to 100 mg/L. In comparison, the abundance of denitrifiers progressively increased from 3.70% to 6.68% with increasing Fe(III) concentration. These suggested that different functional bacteria differed in their responses to Fe(III) stress. Furthermore, long-term Fe(III) exposure significantly up-regulated the abundances of genes associated with nitrogen metabolism and Fe(III) reduction. Overall, the obtained findings are expected to advances our understanding of the responses of anammox process to elevated Fe(III) stress.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanaerobic ammonium oxidation 3acommunity structure 3adenitrifying microorganisms 3aheme 3ahydrazine 3amicrobial communities 3anitrogen 3anitrogen metabolism 3aoxidoreductases 0aAnammox 0aEnzyme activity 0aFe(III) stress 0aFunctional genes 0aMicrobial community1 aZhang, Liqiu1 aYao, Hainan1 aRong, Hongwei1 aLi, Shugeng0 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2021 July 15, v. 414 p.125051-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6200x0304-38947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2021.1250513Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02709naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001600139245013300155500001900288520158900307592002801896650002001924650001501944650001101959650001501970650002301985650001502008651001002023700001602033700001802049700001902067700001402086700001602100700001802116773011902134856007302253852000902326655001202335IND60729511720221119200647.0210228e20210204xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072951172DNAL7 a10.3390/w130404142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Huiqin 10aEmergy Analysis and Ecological Spillover as Tools to Quantify Ecological Compensation in Xuchang City, Qingyi River Basin, China  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aAs an effective means to coordinate cost–benefit allocation of ecological protection between upstream and downstream cities, ecological compensation is often used to improve collaborative basin-wide freshwater resources management. Yet, due to the complex relationships between upstream and downstream ecosystem services, calculating eco-compensation is not an easy task. We used ecological spillover (the amount of local ecosystem services not used in the region and thus flows to downstream areas) and emergy analysis to determine the amount of eco-compensation that the city of Xuchang should pay to the upstream city of Xinzheng (Qingyi River Basin, China) from 2010 to 2014. Eco-compensation was determined by deducting the emergy of the local, self-supplied ecosystem services of Xuchang City, calculated using an ecological-water-footprint-based analysis, from the emergy of the total ecosystem services used in Xuchang, and monetized accordingly. The results showed that the self-supplied ecosystem services decreased from 2010 to 2014 and, thus, Xuchang relied more on the ecological spillover services flowing from Xinzheng. As a result, eco-compensation increased from 990 million Chinese Yuan (¥) in 2010 to ¥509 billion in 2014, mostly due to increased demands for water purification and reduced precipitation around Xuchang. This method can be further enhanced by introducing larger datasets and can be replicated elsewhere to accurately determine ecological compensation, ensuring basin-wide collaboration towards the sustainable management of freshwater resources.  aPublisher supplied data 3adata collection 3aecosystems 3aemergy 3afreshwater 3awater purification 3awatersheds 3aChina1 aLv, Cuimei 1 aLing, Minhua 1 aGu, Changkuan 1 aLi, Yang 1 aWu, Zening 1 aYan, Denghua 0 tWater.g2021 Feb. 04, v. 13, no. 4dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21688x2073-44417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w130404143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02257naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245005800169300001600227520112500243592002801368650001901396650002501415650001101440650001201451650001301463650001501476650001101491650001301502650001601515650001201531650002301543651001001566700001901576700001601595700001801611700002201629773010601651856008101757852000901838655001201847IND60449340020221118004122.0151031e201402  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6044934002DNAL7 a10.1007/s12230-013-9342-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKaguongo, Wachira14aThe Value of Seed Potatoes from Four Systems in Kenya  ap. 109-118.  aAlthough potatoes are the second most valuable crop in Kenya, poor seed potato quality has limited industry expansion. The objectives of this study were to describe the seed potato system, identify problems, determine use of high-quality seed and estimate farmer willingness to pay (WTP) for different types of seed. Data was collected from interviews, forums and surveys. A contingent valuation method (CVM) model was also developed to analyze the factors that influence farmer WTP. It was found that the seed system consists of three sub-components: Formal, Semi-Formal and Farmer. More than 96 % of Kenya seed potatoes were produced in the Farmer category, and were considered to be poor quality. Growers identified bacterial wilt, viral diseases and late blight as the most serious problems. The WTP model revealed that farmer age, distance to seed source, potato training, gender and region were statistically significant explanatory variables. The study recommends that training be conducted to increase production of “clean seed” and “positively-selected seed” in the Semi-Formal part of the seed system.  aPublisher supplied data 3abacterial wilt 3acontingent valuation 3agender 3agrowers 3aindustry 3ainterviews 3amodels 3apotatoes 3aseed tubers 3asurveys 3awillingness to pay 3aKenya1 aMaingi, Gladys1 aBarker, Ian1 aNganga, Nancy1 aGuenthner, Joseph0 tAmerican journal of potato research.g2014 Feb., v. 91, no. 1 p.109-118dSpringer USx1099-209X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12230-013-9342-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01856naa a2200253 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002400075024005100099040001800150100002200168245008700190300001600277500000900293520097300302592002801275650002101303650002301324650001601347773012001363852000901483856009801492655001201590991596923570742620221120210235.0191122e197505  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aCAIN7590693812DNAL7 a10.2135/cropsci1975.0011183X001500030035x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aThomas, Robert O.10aFruiting Behavior of Insect-resistant Cotton Strains in an Insect-free Environment  ap. 400-402.  aepub  aNectariless and frego bract strains of cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) were compared with background-related strains or cultivars Bayou Sm 1, ‘Deltapine 16,’ and ‘Stoneville 7A’ on the basis of productivity and maturity in an insect-free greenhouse environment.

Drifters deployed in the southern North Sea from May to June 2015 are used. The Eulerian currents are obtained by simulation from the coupled circulation model (NEMO) and the wave model (WAM), as well as a stand-alone NEMO circulation model. The wave–current interaction processes are the momentum and energy sea state dependent fluxes, wave-induced mixing and Stokes–Coriolis forcing. The Lagrangian transport model sensitivity to these wave-induced processes in NEMO is quantified using a particle drift model. Wind waves act as a reservoir for energy and momentum. In the coupled wave–ocean circulation model, the momentum that is transferred into the ocean model is considered as a fraction of the total flux that goes directly to the currents plus the momentum lost from wave dissipation. Additional sensitivity studies are performed to assess the potential contribution of windage on the Lagrangian model performance. Wave-induced drift is found to significantly affect the particle transport in the upper ocean. The skill of particle transport simulations depends on wave–ocean circulation interaction processes. The model simulations were assessed using drifter and high-frequency (HF) radar observations. The analysis of the model reveals that Eulerian currents produced by introducing wave-induced parameterization into the ocean model are essential for improving particle transport simulations. The results show that coupled wave–circulation models may improve transport simulations of marine litter, oil spills, larval drift or transport of biological materials.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenergy 3alarvae 3amarine debris 3amodel validation 3amomentum 3aoils 3aradar 3awater 3awater waves 3aNorth Sea1 aRicker, Marcel 1 aCarrasco Alvarez, Ruben 1 aBreivik, Øyvind 1 aSchrum, Corinna 0 tWater.g2021 Feb. 05, v. 13, no. 4dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21688x2073-44417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w130404153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02615naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001800145245009100163300001400254520169400268592002801962650001601990650001302006650001902019650001702038650002402055650001402079651001202093700002402105773011502129856004802244852000902292655001202301IND4391931020221119203332.0140325e200707  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439193102DNAL7 a10.1007/s10661-006-9449-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHaynes, Ralph10aAssessment of the Health Impacts of Particulates from the Redevelopment of Kings Cross  ap. 47-56.  aThe Kings Cross/St. Pancras area has been a rail transport hub from Central London to the Midlands and North Eastern England since the middle of the nineteenth century and dust from the Kings Cross railway lands was even described by Charles Dickens.¹ The Channel Tunnel high speed Rail Link (CTRL) is being constructed between 2001 and 2007 to connect continental Europe to Central London. The CTRL and associated development will help regenerate an area that is surrounded by deprived high density housing estates. London Borough of Camden has set up an extensive particulate monitoring programme to determine if there are any health impacts on local residents from emissions from the demolition and construction work. This article assesses the results from particulate measurements in 2003–2004 and compares this to baseline conditions before the redevelopment work began. The evidence suggests that although 2003 had higher than average pollution levels in the UK as a whole, even higher levels of particulates in the size range PM₁₀–PM₂.₅ (defined as PMcₒₐᵣₛₑ) were measured in Kings Cross. Due to the size of these particulates, they tend to be released from construction works rather than transport or secondary particulate sources. Concentrations in 2004 were lower than 2003, but this was primarily due to meteorological conditions. The paper also looks at the health of the local population and discusses whether these elevated levels are creating a problem and legally constitute a statutory nuisance. The Council continues to work with the contractors to try and ensure best practical means to minimise dust emissions and their effect on local residents.  aPublisher supplied data 3acontractors 3acrossing 3adust emissions 3aparticulates 3arail transportation 3arailroads 3aEngland1 aSavage, A.q(Anna),0 tEnvironmental monitoring and assessment.g2007 July, v. 130, no. 1-3 p.47-56dSpringer-Verlagx0167-63697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-006-9449-5  aDNAL 7aarticle02632naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094024002200122024001900144040001800163100001400181245010400195506007600299520125100375592002801626506003701654650002001691650001101711650002801722650001201750650001901762650001001781650002201791650001301813650003401826650000801860650000901868650001401877650002401891700002101915700002201936700002201958773012301980856007402103852000902177655001202186IND60650602320221207081722.0190710e20181016xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065060232DNAL7 a10.3390/nu101015152doi7 aPMC62136002pmcid7 a303327792pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuo, Jing10aDairy Foods and Body Mass Index over 10-Year: Evidence from the Caerphilly Prospective Cohort Study  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe association between dairy product consumption and body mass index (BMI) remains controversial. The aim of the present study was to investigate the association between total dairy, milk, cheese, cream and butter consumption and BMI change over a 10-year follow-up by using long-term follow-up cohort data from the Caerphilly Prospective Cohort Study (CAPS). The CAPS included 2512 men aged 45&ndash;59 years at baseline, who were followed up at 5-year intervals for over 20-year. A semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire estimated the intake of dairy consumption, including milk, cheese, cream and butter at baseline, 5-year and 10-year follow-up. In total, men free of cardiovascular disease, diabetes and cancer (n = 1690) were included in current analysis. General linear regression and logistic regression were used for data analysis. The results showed higher cheese consumption was associated with lower BMI at the 5-year follow-up (p = 0.013). There was no evidence that higher consumption of total dairy, milk, cream and butter were significantly associated with BMI during the over the 10-year following-up. This study suggest that cheese consumption have beneficial effects on lowering BMI, which needs further investigation.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abody mass index 3abutter 3acardiovascular diseases 3acheeses 3acohort studies 3acream 3adairy consumption 3adiabetes 3afood frequency questionnaires 3amen 3amilk 3aneoplasms 3aregression analysis1 aDougkas, Anestis1 aElwood, Peter  C.1 aGivens, David  I.0 tNutrients.g2018 Oct. 16, v. 10, no. 10dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2271x2072-66437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu101015153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01708naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100002800137245007100165300001600236500002000252520067800272592002800950650002700978650002101005650002501026650002301051650001201074700002301086700003201109700001801141773014301159856007101302852000901373655001201382IND60680319720221119182336.0200105e198502  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068031972DNAL7 a10.2307/12408292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMonterosso, Cesar D.

Tests with transport costs in three Brazilian production areas recommend decentralization of storage—more smaller units closer to farmers, a conclusion supported by sensitivity analysis and recent experience of farmers, planners, and cooperative officials.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural economics 3adecentralization 3adeveloping countries 3aeconomies of scale 3afarmers1 aWright, Charles L.1 aLacerda, Maria Ceclília S.1 aOfugi, Noboru0 tAmerican journal of agricultural economics.g1985 Feb., v. 67, no. 1 p.101-111dOxford University PresswJournal:jnl44932x0002-90927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2307/12408293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02411naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002400140245016400164300001800328520115600346592002801502650001801530650001501548650001401563650003401577650001701611650001501628650001901643650001201662650001901674650001801693650003301711650001301744650001801757650001301775650001401788773012701802856007501929852000902004655001202013IND60794465820221120210249.0220923e20220922xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079446582DNAL7 a10.1039/d2fo01827f2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBoateng, Isaac Duah12aA critical review of ginkgolic acids in Ginkgo biloba leaf extract (EGb): toxicity and technologies to remove ginkgolic acids and their promising bioactivities  ap. 9226-9242.  aGinkgo biloba leaf extract (EGb) is high in bioactive components (over 170), which are used in food additives, medicine, cosmetics, health products, and other sectors. Nonetheless, ginkgolic acids (GAs) in Ginkgo biloba (GB) have been identified as the primary source of EGb's adverse effects such as embryotoxicity, cytotoxicity, neurotoxicity, and inhibition of enzyme systems. As a result, the Chinese, European, and United States pharmacopeias all mandate that the GA concentration in EGb be less than 5 μg g⁻¹. This review looked at the toxicity of ginkgolic acid (from in vitro and in vitro trials) as well as the technologies (such as adsorption/desorption, enzymatic degradation, counter-current chromatography, liquid–liquid microextraction, dual-frequency ultrasonic-solvent extraction, deep eutectic solvent, etc.) used to lower the GA to the desired concentration. These technologies’ advantages, disadvantages, viability, and future trends were compared. In addition, several pharmacological significances of GA extraction, such as anti-microbial, anti-inflammatory, anti-tumor, etc., were discussed, as well as future directions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGinkgo biloba 3aadsorption 3acosmetics 3acountercurrent chromatography 3acytotoxicity 3adesorption 3aembryotoxicity 3aenzymes 3aginkgolic acid 3aleaf extracts 3aliquid-phase microextraction 3amedicine 3aneurotoxicity 3asolvents 3aviability0 tFood & function.g2022 Sept. 22, v. 13, no. 18 p.9226-9242dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26907x2042-650X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d2fo01827f3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02682naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001500150245012500165520120600290592002801496650004401524650003701568650002501605650002101630650001301651650001901664650002201683650001901705650002301724650001901747650000701766650001701773650001501790650001901805653003101824653002301855653001601878700001601894700001701910700001701927700002001944700001701964700001301981773011201994856008502106852000902191655001202200IND60687913320221122065025.0200427e20200615xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068791332DNAL7 a10.1016/j.memsci.2020.1181042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Caini10aHigh-performance nanofiltration membrane with structurally controlled PES substrate containing electrically aligned CNTs  aA structurally controlled polyethersulfone (PES) membrane, as the substrate of the thin film composite nanofiltration (NF) membranes, was designed and fabricated with aligned carbon nanotubes (ACNTs) by a direct current electric field. The morphology and properties of the NF membranes were simultaneously affected by the PES substrate with especial macrovoids and ACNTs, increasing the permeability from 6.4 to 29.7 L/m² h bar. It was confirmed by FT-IR and XPS that the poly(piperazine amide) selective layer of the modified NF membrane has an increased content of –COOH for enhanced hydrophilicity. The zeta potential proves that the surface of the NF membrane modified by electric field has weaker negative charge than that of unmodified membrane in the range of pH = 5–9. Under the combined action of the Donnan effect and size exclusion, the rejection of MgCl₂ increased while maintaining the dianion rejection above 95%. Particularly, the NF membrane modified with ACNTs exhibited better chlorine resistance and antifouling ability, thus improving the stability and perdurability of membranes. Our work utilizes the characteristics of ACNTs to explore its potential in NF membranes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aartificial membranes 3acarbon nanotubes 3achlorine 3aelectric field 3afilms (materials) 3ahydrophilicity 3amagnesium chloride 3ananofiltration 3apH 3apermeability 3apiperazine 3azeta potential 0aInterfacial polymerization 0aElectrically align 0aAntifouling1 aWang, Wenyi1 aZhu, Liuyong1 aCui, Fangyan1 aXie, Chengcheng1 aChen, Xingyu1 aLi, Ning0 tJournal of membrane science.g2020 June 15, v. 605 p.118104-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12468x0376-73887nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.memsci.2020.1181043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02997naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094024002200122024001900144040001800163100002200181245013600203506007600339520140700415592002801822506003701850650002801887650002301915650002801938650002801966650001301994650003002007650001502037650002402052650001102076650001502087650001502102650002202117650002902139650002002168650001702188700002402205700001902229700003002248700003102278773012302309856007402432852000902506655001202515IND60650602520221207081720.0190710e20181016xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065060252DNAL7 a10.3390/nu101015172doi7 aPMC62139462pmcid7 a303327872pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aArnold, Jason  W.10aPrebiotics for Lactose Intolerance: Variability in Galacto-Oligosaccharide Utilization by Intestinal <i>Lactobacillus rhamnosus</i>  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aLactose intolerance, characterized by a decrease in host lactase expression, affects approximately 75% of the world population. Galacto-oligosaccharides (GOS) are prebiotics that have been shown to alleviate symptoms of lactose intolerance and to modulate the intestinal microbiota, promoting the growth of beneficial microorganisms. We hypothesized that mechanisms of GOS utilization by intestinal bacteria are variable, impacting efficacy and response, with differences occurring at the strain level. This study aimed to determine the mechanisms by which human-derived Lactobacillus rhamnosus strains metabolize GOS. Genomic comparisons between strains revealed differences in carbohydrate utilization components, including transporters, enzymes for degradation, and transcriptional regulation, despite a high overall sequence identity (>95%) between strains. Physiological and transcriptomics analyses showed distinct differences in carbohydrate metabolism profiles and GOS utilization between strains. A putative operon responsible for GOS utilization was identified and characterized by genetic disruption of the 6-phospho-&beta;-galactosidase, which had a critical role in GOS utilization. Our findings highlight the importance of strain-specific bacterial metabolism in the selection of probiotics and synbiotics to alleviate symptoms of gastrointestinal disorders including lactose intolerance.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aLactobacillus rhamnosus 3abeta-galactosidase 3acarbohydrate metabolism 3agalactooligosaccharides 3agenomics 3aintestinal microorganisms 3aintestines 3alactose intolerance 3aoperon 3aprebiotics 3aprobiotics 3asequence analysis 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranscriptomics 3atransporters1 aSimpson, Joshua  B.1 aRoach, Jeffery1 aBruno-Bárcena, José M.,1 aAzcarate-Peril, M.

In the nervous system, synapses are crucial substrates for homeostatic modulation, serving to establish, maintain, and modify the balance of excitation and inhibition. Synapses must be sufficiently flexible to enable the plasticity required for learning and memory but also endowed with the stability to last a lifetime. In response to the processes of development, growth, remodeling, aging, and disease that challenge synapses, latent forms of adaptive plasticity become activated to maintain synaptic stability. In recent years, new insights into the homeostatic control of synaptic function have been achieved using the powerful Drosophila neuromuscular junction (NMJ). This review will focus on work over the past 10 years that has illuminated the cellular and molecular mechanisms of five homeostats that operate at the fly NMJ. These homeostats adapt to loss of postsynaptic neurotransmitter receptor functionality, glutamate imbalance, axonal injury, as well as aberrant synaptic growth and target innervation. These diverse homeostats work independently yet can be simultaneously expressed to balance neurotransmission. Growing evidence from this model glutamatergic synapse suggests these ancient homeostatic signaling systems emerged early in evolution and are fundamental forms of plasticity that also function to stabilize mammalian cholinergic NMJs and glutamatergic central synapses.  aPublisher supplied data  aNS091546cNational Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke  aNS111414cNational Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke 3aDrosophila 3aevolution 3aglutamic acid 3ainnervation 3amammals 3amemory 3aneurotransmitter receptors 3aplasticity 3asynapse 3asynaptic transmission1 aDickman, Dion1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1884-284X0 tCellular and molecular life sciences.g2021 Apr., v. 78, no. 7 p.3159-3179dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl55291x1420-682X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00018-020-03732-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02798naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001700153245013900170520132700309592002801636650001901664650001601683650002501699650002001724650002401744650002501768650001301793650001601806650001101822650001001833650001701843650002601860650001301886653002601899653003201925653001701957653001401974653002101988700001702009700002002026700001802046700002002064700001602084773011902100856008802219852000902307655001202316IND60772403820221117044537.0220606e20220801xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077240382DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.1548472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYu, Yunjiang10aPotential obesogenic effects of TBBPA and its alternatives TBBPS and TCBPA revealed by metabolic perturbations in human hepatoma cells  aTo date, increasing numbers of studies have shown the obesogenic effects of tetrabromobisphenol A (TBBPA). Tetrabromobisphenol S (TBBPS) and tetrachlorobisphenol A (TCBPA) are two common alternatives to TBBPA, and their environmental distributions are frequently reported. However, their toxicity and the associated potential health risks are poorly documented. Herein, we performed untargeted metabolomics to study the metabolic perturbations in HepG2 cells exposed to TBBPA and its alternatives. Consequently, no loss of cellular viability was observed in HepG2 cells exposed to 0.1 μmol/L and 1 μmol/L TBBPA, TBBPS and TCBPA. However, multivariate analysis and metabolic profiles revealed significant perturbations in glycerophospholipid and fatty acyl levels in HepG2 cells exposure to TBBPS and TCBPA. The evident increases in the glucose 1-phosphate and fructose 6-phosphate levels in HepG2 cells were proposed to be induced by the promotion of PGM1/PGM2 and GPI gene expression and the suppression of UPG2 and GFPT1/GFPT2 gene expression. Our results suggest that TBBPS and TCBPA are more likely to disrupt liver metabolic homeostasis and potentially drive liver dysfunction than TBBPA. Our study is significant for the re-evaluation of the health risks associated with TBBPA and its alternatives TBBPS and TCBPA.  aPublisher supplied data 3acell viability 3aenvironment 3afructose 6-phosphate 3agene expression 3aglucose 1-phosphate 3aglycerophospholipids 3ahepatoma 3ahomeostasis 3ahumans 3aliver 3ametabolomics 3amultivariate analysis 3atoxicity 0aTetrabromobisphenol A 0aBrominated flame retardants 0aMetabolomics 0aObesogens 0aSugar metabolism1 aHao, Chaojie1 aXiang, Mingdeng1 aTian, Jinglin1 aKuang, Hongxuan1 aLi, Zhenchi0 tScience of the total environment.g2022 Aug. 01, v. 832 p.154847-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.1548473Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02722naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245015700168300001300325500001500338520109500353592002801448650001901476650002601495650001401521650001101535650002801546650001001574650001601584650000701600650002401607650002001631650001501651650001001666653002001676653002101696653001701717653002401734653003701758653002301795700001701818700001201835700001701847700001701864700001701881700001801898700001301916773016901929856008502098852000902183655001202192IND60527027120221119083839.0180904e201601  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052702712DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jbiosc.2015.04.0232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Caihong10aBiochemical characterization of a novel thermophilic α-galactosidase from Talaromyces leycettanus JCM12802 with significant transglycosylation activity  ap. 7-12.  a2019-12-06  aThermophilic α-galactosidases have great potentials in biotechnological and medicinal applications due to their high-temperature activity and specific stability. In this study, a novel α-galactosidase gene of glycoside hydrolase family 27 (aga27A) was cloned from Talaromyces leycettanus JCM12802 and successfully expressed in Pichia pastoris GS115. Purified recombinant Aga27A (rAga27A) was thermophilic and thermotolerant, exhibiting the maximum activity at 70°C and retaining stability at 65°C. Like most fungal α-galactosidases, rAga27A had an acidic pH optimum (pH 4.0) but retained stability over a boarder pH range (pH 3.0–11.0) at 70°C. Moreover, the enzyme exhibited strong resistance to most metal ions and chemicals tested (except for Ag⁺ and SDS) and great tolerance to galactose (19 mM). The preferable transglycosylation capacity of rAga27A with various substrates further widens its application spectrum. Thus rAga27A with excellent enzymatic properties will be ideal for applications in various industries, especially for the synthesis of galactooligosaccharides.  aPublisher supplied data 3aheat tolerance 3aKomagataella pastoris 3agalactose 3asilver 3agalactooligosaccharides 3agenes 3aTalaromyces 3apH 3aalpha-galactosidase 3aenzyme activity 3ametal ions 3afungi 0aPichia pastoris 0aα-Galactosidase 0aThermophilic 0aGalactose tolerance 0aTalaromyces leycettanus JCM12802 0aTransglycosylation1 aWang, Huimin1 aMa, Rui1 aShi, Pengjun1 aNiu, Canfang1 aLuo, Huiying1 aYang, Peilong1 aYao, Bin0 tJournal of bioscience and bioengineering.g2016 Jan., v. 121, no. 1 p.7-12dElsevier B.V.aThe Society for Biotechnology, JapanwJournal:jnl3929975x1389-17237nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jbiosc.2015.04.0233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02284naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002600148245003900174300001800213500001100231520110100242592002801343596004401371596004401415650002601459650002101485650002801506650001001534650001501544650001001559650001101569650001501580650001801595700005601613773014901669856008301818852000901901655001201910IND60733771920221122053320.0211002e202104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073377192DNAL7 a10.1007/s00018-020-03736-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStrickland, Ashley B.10aMechanisms of fungal dissemination  ap. 3219-3238.  aReview  aFungal infections are an increasing threat to global public health. There are more than six million fungal species worldwide, but less than 1% are known to infect humans. Most of these fungal infections are superficial, affecting the hair, skin and nails, but some species are capable of causing life-threatening diseases. The most common of these include Cryptococcus neoformans, Aspergillus fumigatus and Candida albicans. These fungi are typically innocuous and even constitute a part of the human microbiome, but if these pathogens disseminate throughout the body, they can cause fatal infections which account for more than one million deaths worldwide each year. Thus, systemic dissemination of fungi is a critical step in the development of these deadly infections. In this review, we discuss our current understanding of how fungi disseminate from the initial infection sites to the bloodstream, how immune cells eliminate fungi from circulation and how fungi leave the blood and enter distant organs, highlighting some recent advances and offering some perspectives on future directions.  aPublisher supplied data  aAI131219cNational Institutes of Health  aAI131905cNational Institutes of Health 3aAspergillus fumigatus 3aCandida albicans 3aCryptococcus neoformans 3ablood 3ablood flow 3afungi 3ahumans 3amicrobiome 3apublic health1 aShi, Meiqing1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9890-88070 tCellular and molecular life sciences.g2021 Apr., v. 78, no. 7 p.3219-3238dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl55291x1420-682X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00018-020-03736-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03830naa a2200673 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100006000151245020600211520164400417592002802061650002002089650001602109650001502125650001402140650001802154650002902172650001402201650001902215650002002234650001802254650001602272650001502288650004302303650001202346650001702358650003102375650002102406650001202427650001002439650001602449650001802465650001702483650001602500653001402516653001102530653001502541653002802556653002302584653001002607653003402617700001802651700006402669700001702733700002502750700002602775700002202801700002102823700002002844700002002864700006402884773010102948856008603049852000903135655001203144IND60722090620221116182445.0211029e202105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072209062DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodhyd.2020.1065652doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBajka, Balazs H.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1803-334014aThe impact of replacing wheat flour with cellular legume powder on starch bioaccessibility, glycaemic response and bread roll quality: A double-blind randomised controlled trial in healthy participants  aThe global rise in obesity and type 2 diabetes has generated significant interest in regulating the glycaemic impact of staple foods. Wheat breads (white or wholemeal) are popular staples, but have a high-glycaemic index, due to the highly digestible wheat starch. Reducing the glycaemic potency of white bread is challenging because the bread-making conditions are mostly conducive to starch gelatinisation. Cellular legume powders are a new source of type 1 resistant starch, where the starch is encapsulated by dietary fibre in the form of intact plant cell walls. The starch in these cell powders is less susceptible to gelatinisation and digestion than starch in conventional legume flours. However, legume cell resilience to baking conditions and the effects of this ingredient on glycaemic responses and product quality are unknown. Here we show that the integrity of cell wall fibre in chickpea powder was preserved on baking and this led to a ~40% reduction in in vivo glycaemic responses (iAUC₁₂₀) to white bread rolls (~50 g available carbohydrate and 12 g wheat protein per serving) when 30% or 60% (w/w) of the wheat flour was replaced with intact cell powder. Significant reductions in glycaemic responses were achieved without adverse effects on bread texture, appearance or palatability. Starch digestibility analysis and microscopy confirmed the importance of cell integrity in attenuating glycaemic responses. Alternative processing methods that preserve cell integrity are a new, promising way to provide healthier low glycaemic staple foods; we anticipate that this will improve dietary options for diabetes care.  aPublisher supplied data 3abioavailability 3abreadmaking 3acell walls 3achickpeas 3adietary fiber 3adigestible carbohydrates 3adigestion 3agelatinization 3aglycemic effect 3ahydrocolloids 3aingredients 3amicroscopy 3anoninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 3aobesity 3apalatability 3arandomized clinical trials 3aresistant starch 3atexture 3awheat 3awheat flour 3awheat protein 3awheat starch 3awhite bread 0aPulseON® 0aLegume 0aPlant cell 0aType 1 resistant starch 0aGlycaemic response 0aBread 0aContinuous glucose monitoring1 aPinto, Ana M.1 aAhn-Jarvis, Jennifer1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2372-54641 aRyden, Peter1 aPerez-Moral, Natalia1 avan der Schoot, Alice1 aStocchi, Costanza1 aBland, Catherine1 aBerry, Sarah E.1 aEllis, Peter R.1 aEdwards, Cathrina H.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4952-02290 tFood hydrocolloids.g2021 May, v. 114 p.106565-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46643x0268-005X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodhyd.2020.1065653Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03088naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245010900167300001400276520166800290592002801958650001301986650003101999650001302030650001502043650001902058650000902077650001102086650001802097650000702115650002602122650001302148653003502161653003102196653002602227653003402253653002902287653002802316653001502344700001902359773017002378856008502548852000902633655001202642IND60527027320221119083832.0180904e201601  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052702732DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jbiosc.2015.05.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee, Eun-Ju,10aFormation of chitosan-fucoidan nanoparticles and their electrostatic interactions: Quantitative analysis  ap. 73-83.  aThe stoichiometric distributions of both positive amino groups and negative sulfate ions loaded in chitosan-fucoidan nanoparticles (CFNs) were predicted quantitatively by correlating the separate yields of loaded chitosan and fucoidan, and a proposed relative charge density model (case 1). In addition, those distributions of both positive amino groups and negative sulfate ions loaded in CFNs were obtained by deriving the expression of their loaded concentrations directly from the experimental data (case 2). Both the model-prediction and experimental derivations were remarkably consistent with each other except at pH 2. The discrepancy between cases 1 and 2 at pH 2 was explained by an increase in the sulfate group loading because of the most intensive electrostatic (specific ion) interactions at pH 2. The ratio of the CFN-free net charge density shielded by counter-ions in the solution entrapped in CFNs to their counter-ion-crosslinking charge density was suggested to be a quantitative criterion for determining the size distribution of CFNs. The formation of CFNs ranked according to size was predicted well and explained reasonably by the suggested criterion, considering both the ionic strength of the entrapped solution in CFNs and the nonspecific binding (interaction) of the positive amino groups among the chitosan molecules. Furthermore, the fraction of nonspecifically-bound positive amino groups causing hysteresis was quantified from the positive net charged amino groups per unit-mass CFN. Thus, its magnitude was predicted to have a strong correlation with the CFN-preparation conditions, such as pH and fucoidan to chitosan mass ratio.  aPublisher supplied data 3achitosan 3aelectrostatic interactions 3afucoidan 3ahysteresis 3aionic strength 3aions 3amodels 3ananoparticles 3apH 3aquantitative analysis 3asulfates 0aChitosan-fucoidan nanoparticle 0aElectrostatic interactions 0aQuantitative analysis 0aRelative charge density model 0aSpecific ion interaction 0aNonspecific interaction 0aPrediction1 aLim, Kwang-Hee0 tJournal of bioscience and bioengineering.g2016 Jan., v. 121, no. 1 p.73-83dElsevier B.V.aThe Society for Biotechnology, JapanwJournal:jnl3929975x1389-17237nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jbiosc.2015.05.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02443naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245011400167300001600281520135100297592002801648650002701676650001101703650001401714650000901728650001901737650002001756650001401776650000901790650002701799650001101826650002301837651001101860773012001871856008101991852000902072655001202081IND60600093820221123030305.0180702e201805  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060009382DNAL7 a10.1134/S00329452180300372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGordeeva, N.

It was revealed that temporal variation at MHC I-A1 is statistically insignificant in comparison between the samples of the juveniles sampled at different times during the downstream migration. It is also insignificant between the samples of juvenile and adult fish of the same generation, and between samples divided by a single and seven generations. At the same time, the samples of neighboring populations differ significantly. The possibility of differentiation of the populations on the local scale and temporal stability of the allele frequencies indicate the MHC I-A1 as valuable marker for the development of the population data bases. Inclusion of the MHC I-A1 into the panel of other markers (microsatellites, in particular) allows for considerable increase in the resolution power for identification as to which population an individual in the mixed sea catch belongs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOncorhynchus gorbuscha 3aadults 3adatabases 3afish 3agene frequency 3agenetic markers 3ajuveniles 3aloci 3amicrosatellite repeats 3arivers 3atemporal variation 3aRussia0 tJournal of ichthyology.g2018 May, v. 58, no. 3 p.410-416dPleiades PublishingwJournal:J000000402x0032-94527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1134/S00329452180300373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02711naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002300155245018100178300001600359520096500375592002801340650002501368650001601393650001501409650000901424650001701433653000701450653000901457653000701466653000801473653000801481653000801489653000801497653000801505653000801513653000701521653000701528653001001535653000801545653001101553653000901564653000801573653000701581653000901588653000901597653001001606653003301616653000801649653001601657653003401673653001001707700005901717700002201776700002301798700001901821700001801840773011601858856009001974852000902064655001202073IND60556400620221120145332.0190214e201610  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055640062DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemphyslip.2016.09.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFurukawa, Takayuki10aRapid tin-mediated access to a lysophosphatidylethanolamine (LPE) library: Application to positional LC/MS analysis for hepatic LPEs in non-alcoholic steatohepatitis model mice  ap. 133-138.  aEven though lysophospholipids have attracted much interest in recent years on account of their unique bioactivity, research related to lysophospholipids is usually hampered by problems associated with standard sample preparation and discrimination of regioisomers. Herein, we demonstrate a quick tin-chemistry-based synthetic route to lysophosphatidylethanolamines (LPEs) and its application in the positional analysis of hepatic LPEs in non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) model mice. We found that the preference of hepatic LPE regioisomer largely depends on the unsaturation of acyl chain in both control and NASH model mice. In addition, hepatic C18:2-LPE and C20:5-LPE levels were significantly lower in the NASH model mice than those in the control. The LC/MS technique based on the library of LPE regioisomers allows an accurate observation of hepatic LPE metabolism and might provide useful information to elucidate yet ambiguous pathogenesis of NASH.  aPublisher supplied data 3abioactive properties 3afatty liver 3ametabolism 3amice 3apathogenesis 0aTr 0aDPPE 0aPE 0aLPL 0aLPE 0aLPC 0aLPI 0aLPA 0aLPS 0aPL 0aHG 0aiPrOH 0aDMF 0aBu2SnO 0aTeoc 0aTFA 0aFA 0aPUFA 0aNASH 0aNAFLD 0aLysophosphatidylethanolamine 0aTin 0aRegioisomer 0aNon-alcoholic steatohepatitis 0aLC/MS1 aFuda, Hirotoshi1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7338-076X1 aMiyanaga, Satoshi1 aWatanabe, Chinatsu1 aChiba, Hitoshi1 aHui, Shu-Ping0 tChemistry and physics of lipids.g2016 Oct., v. 200 p.133-138dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl20199x0009-30847nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemphyslip.2016.09.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02175naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245016500165300001600330520099800346592002801344650002401372650001201396650000901408650001601417650001601433650001401449650002301463650002001486650001801506650001101524650002201535700001601557700001801573773012001591856008101711852000901792655001201801IND60600093920221123020158.0180702e201805  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060009392DNAL7 a10.1134/S00329452180301162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPavlov, E.

The juveniles were 2.5 months old and were exposed to brief (4 days) heat stress (19–20°C). The increase of water temperature was followed by anomalies of gonads after 1 month (destruction of sex cells and hypertrophy of connective tissue). In females, the increased water temperature activates sex redetermination: in ovaries, cysts containing destroyed spermatogonia are found. In 1.5 months, the exogenous application of surfagon was followed by acceleration of spermatogenesis in gonads of experimental fish (2.5 months old) and by a slight decrease of fraction of anomalies in structure of their testes compared with the gonads of fish not exposed to surfagon. Exposure of rainbow trout to surfagon prior to sex differentiation is more efficient than after it is completed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOncorhynchus mykiss 3afemales 3afish 3aheat stress 3ahypertrophy 3ajuveniles 3asexual development 3aspermatogenesis 3aspermatogonia 3atestes 3awater temperature1 aBush, A.

Cultivars Grown under Desertic Conditions  aNAL-light  aSugar beet is a potential source of pectin, competitive with traditional sources, that has recently acquired great relevance for its interesting covalent gelling and applications in food and biomedical industries. Pectins from three Sugar beet (Beta vulgaris L.) commercial cultivars (Cadet, Coronado large, and SV MEI) were grown under irrigated desertic conditions and the influence of cultivar, on pectin yield, composition, physicochemical and gelling characteristics was investigated. The composition and chemical properties of pectin from the three cultivars were in general, statistically different, especially in the Syngenta Cadet cultivar, presenting higher protein (10.3%), neutral sugars (21.6%), galacturonic acid (55%) and ferulic acid (5.5 mg/g) content, which are important parameters for gel formation. All pectins gelled via oxidative coupling and the main ferulic acid dimers found were 8-5′ and 8-O-4′. Pectin from Cadet cultivar formed gels with higher hardness (6.65 N) and adhesiveness (12.2 N) values than the other two varieties. The results indicate that pectin composition is affected by the sugar beet cultivars reported herein, especially in ferulic acid content, which confer the covalent gelling capability. Sugar beet cultivars grown under desert conditions could be a source of gelling ferulated pectins for the food industry, as valuable as those obtained in temperate conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBeta vulgaris 3aadhesion 3aagronomy 3acultivars 3aferulic acid 3afood industry 3agalacturonic acid 3agelation 3agels 3ahardness 3airrigation 3apectins 3aphysicochemical properties 3asugar beet1 aSanchez-Villegas, Jose  A.1 aLopez-Franco, Yolanda 1 aCarvajal-Millan, Elizabeth 1 aTroncoso-Rojas, Rosalba 1 aCarvallo-Ruiz, Tania 1 aRascon-Chu, Agustin 0 tAgronomy.g2020 Dec. 28, v. 11, no. 1dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:12361x2073-43957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agronomy110100403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02445naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004100111040001800152100002300170245011400193300001400307520104500321592002801366650002901394650002401423650001101447650001901458650001101477650002101488650002501509650001201534650001701546650001601563650002901579650003001608650001101638650001701649650002301666700002601689700002901715700002201744700003201766773009301798856008701891852000901978655001201987IND4471449520221119213735.0141112e201209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447144952DNAL7 a228194512pmid7 a10.1016/j.marenvres.2012.06.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBustamante, María10aDetecting human mitigation intervention: Effects of sewage treatment upgrade on rocky macrofaunal assemblages  ap. 27-37.  aThe effectiveness of secondary vs primary treatments of wastewaters in mitigating the effects of sewage discharge on the multivariate structure and diversity of rocky invertebrate assemblages was assessed over a nine-year period through a beyond-BACI experimental design. Assemblages from different tidal levels (i.e. mid-shore, low-shore, 3 m and 8 m subtidal) were sampled at the impact location (I) and three control locations (Cs) at a hierarchy of spatial scales. The improvement in water treatment significantly changed the structure, diversity and cover of low intertidal assemblages. Faunal cover at 8 m subtidal increased significantly after the treatment upgrade at I. The secondary treatment also affected patterns of spatial heterogeneity between I and Cs for mid-shore and 3 m subtidal assemblages. This study demonstrates that powerful experimental designs combined with univariate and multivariate analytical approaches are fundamental in distinguishing the subtle effects of human impact from those of natural processes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanthropogenic activities 3aexperimental design 3ahumans 3arisk reduction 3asewage 3asewage treatment 3awastewater treatment 2aAnimals 2aBiodiversity 2aEnvironment 2aEnvironmental Monitoring 2aInvertebratesxphysiology 2aSewage 2aTime Factors 2aWater Purification1 aBevilacqua, Stanislao1 aTajadura Tejada, Javier,1 aTerlizzi, Antonio1 aSaiz-Salinas, José Ignacio0 tMarine environmental research.g2012 Sept., v. 80 p.27-37dElsevier Ltdx0141-11367nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.marenvres.2012.06.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02895naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002100092024003500113040001800148100002100166245012100187300001600308500001500324520145900339592002801798650002401826650001401850650002501864650001001889650002301899650002201922650002101944650002401965650002201989650001402011651001302025653003002038700001902068700002302087700001902110773010502129856011202234856008102346961001302427852000902440655001202449IND4389664720221119232255.0151024e200704  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438966472DNAL7 a10113/428092hdl7 a10.1007/s10530-006-9035-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJongejans, Eelke10aEstablishment and spread of founding populations of an invasive thistle: the role of competition and seed limitation  ap. 317-325.  a2019-12-06  aSuccessful plant invasions require both the founding and local spread of new populations. High plant densities occur only when founding plants are able to disperse their seeds well locally to quickly colonize and fill the new patch. We test this ability in a 7-year field experiment with Carduus acanthoides, an invasive weed in several North American ecosystems. Founder plants were planted in the center of 64 m² plots and we monitored the recruitment, distribution pattern, mortality, and seed production of the seedlings that originated from these founding plants. Competing vegetation was clipped not at all, once, or twice each year to evaluate the importance of interspecific competition. More seedlings recruited in the intermediate once-clipped plots, and these seedlings also survived better. The control plots had fewer microsites for seedling recruitment; clipping a second time in September stimulated grasses to fill up the gaps. The number of C. acanthoides recruits and their median distances from the founder plants were also explained by the initial seed production of the founding plants. Overall, the experiment shows that the success of founder plants can fluctuate strongly, as 55% of the plots were empty by the sixth year. Our study suggests that the local invasion speed following initial establishment depends strongly on both the propagule pressure and availability of suitable microsites for seedling recruitment and growth.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCarduus acanthoides 3aseedlings 3aspatial distribution 3aweeds 3acolonizing ability 3aplant competition 3ainvasive species 3aecological invasion 3aseed productivity 3amortality 3aMaryland 0ainterspecific competition1 aSkarpaas, Olav1 aTipping, Philip W.1 aShea, Katriona0 tBiological invasions.g2007 Apr., v. 9, no. 3 p.317-325dKluwer Academic Publishersx1387-35477nnas40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/428093Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10530-006-9035-33Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle01931naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001300147245013400160300001800294520083300312592002801145650001301173650002801186650001401214650001301228650001901241650004401260650003301304650002101337700001701358700001901375700001501394700001701409773008601426856004801512852000901560655001201569IND50066324020221123034148.0130511e201306  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006632402DNAL7 a10.1007/s10570-013-9925-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Xin10aRegenerated cellulose film with enhanced tensile strength prepared with ionic liquid 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium acetate (EMIMAc)  ap. 1391-1399.  aIn this study, environmentally friendly regenerated cellulose films with enhanced tensile strength were successfully prepared by incorporation of plasticizer agents using 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium acetate as solvent.

J.10aRibosomal protein S3 associates with the TFIIH complex and positively regulates nucleotide excision repair  ap. 3591-3606.  aIn mammalian cells, the bulky DNA adducts caused by ultraviolet radiation are mainly repaired via the nucleotide excision repair (NER) pathway; some defects in this pathway lead to a genetic disorder known as xeroderma pigmentosum (XP). Ribosomal protein S3 (rpS3), a constituent of the 40S ribosomal subunit, is a multi-functional protein with various extra-ribosomal functions, including a role in the cellular stress response and DNA repair-related activities. We report that rpS3 associates with transcription factor IIH (TFIIH) via an interaction with the xeroderma pigmentosum complementation group D (XPD) protein and complements its function in the NER pathway. For optimal repair of UV-induced duplex DNA lesions, the strong helicase activity of the TFIIH complex is required for unwinding damaged DNA around the lesion. Here, we show that XP-D cells overexpressing rpS3 showed markedly increased resistance to UV radiation through XPD and rpS3 interaction. Additionally, the knockdown of rpS3 caused reduced NER efficiency in HeLa cells and the overexpression of rpS3 partially restored helicase activity of the TFIIH complex of XP-D cells in vitro. We also present data suggesting that rpS3 is involved in post-excision processing in NER, assisting TFIIH in expediting the repair process by increasing its turnover rate when DNA is damaged. We propose that rpS3 is an accessory protein of the NER pathway and its recruitment to the repair machinery augments repair efficiency upon UV damage by enhancing XPD helicase function and increasing its turnover rate.  aPublisher supplied data  aNRF-2019S1A5A2A03050121cNational Research Foundation of Korea  aNRF-2020R1A2C2100803cNational Research Foundation of Korea 3aDNA adducts 3aDNA helicases 3aDNA repair 3agenetic disorders 3amammals 3aphotosensitivity disorders 3aribosomal proteins 3astress response 3atranscription factors 3aultraviolet radiation1 aKim, S.

Adipose tissue acts as an endocrine organ secreting a wide range of inflammatory adipocytokines, which leads to systemic inflammation, insulin resistance, and metabolic disorders. The traditional Mediterranean diet is characterized by a high phenolic-rich foods intake, including extra-virgin olive oil, nuts, red wine, vegetables, fruits, legumes, and whole-grain cereals. Evidence for polyphenols&rsquo; effect on obesity and weight control in humans is inconsistent and the health effects of polyphenols depend on the amount consumed and their bioavailability. The mechanisms involved in weight loss in which polyphenols may have a role are: activating &beta;-oxidation; a prebiotic effect for gut microbiota; inducing satiety; stimulating energy expenditure by inducing thermogenesis in brown adipose tissue; modulating adipose tissue inhibiting adipocyte differentiation; promoting adipocyte apoptosis and increasing lipolysis. Even though the intake of some specific polyphenols has been associated with body weight changes, there is still no evidence for the effects of total polyphenols or some polyphenol subclasses in humans on adiposity.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aMediterranean diet 3aadipocytes 3aadipokines 3aadiposity 3aapoptosis 3abeta oxidation 3abioavailability 3abody weight changes 3abrown adipose tissue 3aenergy expenditure 3aextra-virgin olive oil 3afruits 3agrains 3ahealth effects assessments 3aheat production 3ahumans 3ainflammation 3ainsulin resistance 3aintestinal microorganisms 3alegumes 3alipolysis 3ametabolic diseases 3anuts 3aobesity 3apolyphenols 3aprebiotics 3ared wines 3asatiety 3avegetables 3aweight control 3aweight loss 3awhole grain foods1 aLamuela-Raventós, Rosa  M.1 aDoménech, Mónica1 aEstruch, Ramon0 tNutrients.g2018 Oct. 17, v. 10, no. 10dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2271x2072-66437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu101015233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02038naa a2200277 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002800152245009500180300001700275520117100292592002801463650001201491650001301503650001101516650002001527650001801547700002401565773009501589856005501684852000901739655001201748IND4398565720221120151533.0150416e200712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439856572DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1541-0420.2007.00779.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRivest, LouisâPaul10aApplications and Extensions of Chao's Moment Estimator for the Size of a Closed Population  ap. 999-1006.  aThis article revisits Chao's (1989, Biometrics45, 427â438) lower bound estimator for the size of a closed population in a markârecapture experiment where the capture probabilities vary between animals (model Mh). First, an extension of the lower bound to models featuring a time effect and heterogeneity in capture probabilities (Mth) is proposed. The biases of these lower bounds are shown to be a function of the heterogeneity parameter for several loglinear models for Mth. Smallâsample bias reduction techniques for Chao's lower bound estimator are also derived. The application of the loglinear model underlying Chao's estimator when heterogeneity has been detected in the primary periods of a robust design is then investigated. A test for the null hypothesis that Chao's loglinear model provides unbiased abundance estimators is provided. The strategy of systematically using Chao's loglinear model in the primary periods of a robust design where heterogeneity has been detected is investigated in a Monte Carlo experiment. Its impact on the estimation of the population sizes and of the survival rates is evaluated in a Monte Carlo experiment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimals 3abiometry 3amodels 3apopulation size 3asurvival rate1 aBaillargeon, Sophie0 tBiometrics.g2007 Dec., v. 63, no. 4 p.999-1006dBlackwell Publishing Incx0006-341X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1541-0420.2007.00779.x  aDNAL 7aarticle02996naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100002300188245008900211300001200300506007600312520126800388592002801656506003701684650002601721650002201747650002401769650002101793650001701814650001501831650003801846650001001884650001101894650001101905650001501916650002201931650001401953650001301967650005201980650001202032650005002044650004002094700002802134700002502162700002002187700001902207700002002226773011702246856008202363852000902445655001202454IND60621332720221207093916.0190823e201812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062133272DNAL7 a10.1007/s13205-018-1500-z2doi7 aPMC62377082pmcid7 a304675312pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aModarresi, Mostafa10aTransient expression of anti-VEFGR2 nanobody in Nicotiana tabacum and N. benthamiana  ap. 484.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aIn human, the interaction between vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and its receptor (VEGFR2) is critical for tumor angiogenesis. This is a vital process for cancer tumor growth and metastasis. Blocking VEGF/VEGFR2 conjugation by antibodies inhibits the neovascularization and tumor metastasis. This investigation designed to use a transient expression platform for production of recombinant anti-VEGFR2 nanobody in tobacco plants. At first, anti-VEGFR2-specific nanobody gene was cloned in a Turnip mosaic virus (TuMV)-based vector, and then, it was expressed in Nicotiana benthamiana and Nicotiana tabacum cv. Xanthi transiently. The expression of nanobody in tobacco plants were confirmed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), dot blot, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA), and Western blot analysis. It was shown that tobacco plants could accumulate nanobody up to level 0.45% of total soluble protein (8.3 µg/100 mg of fresh leaf). This is the first report of the successful expression of the camelied anti-VEFGR2 nanobody gene in tobacco plants using a plant viral vector. This system provides a fast solution for production of pharmaceutical and commercial proteins such as anti-cancer nanobodies in tobacco plants.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aNicotiana benthamiana 3aNicotiana tabacum 3aTurnip mosaic virus 3aWestern blotting 3aangiogenesis 3aantibodies 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3agenes 3ahumans 3aleaves 3ametastasis 3amolecular cloning 3aneoplasms 3aproteins 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3atobacco 3avascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 3avascular endothelial growth factors1 aJavaran, Mokhtar Jalali1 aShams-bakhsh, Masoud1 aZeinali, Sirous1 aBehdani, Mahdi1 aMirzaee, Malihe0 t3 Biotech.g2018 Dec., v. 8, no. 12 p.484-484dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:22884x2190-572X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13205-018-1500-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01508naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100002300137245006900160300001400229500002000243520062100263592002800884650003000912650002500942650002300967700001900990773014101009856007101150852000901221655001201230IND60680320520221119183605.0200105e198502  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068032052DNAL7 a10.2307/12408272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKawagoe, Toshihiko13aAn Intercountry Comparison of Agricultural Production Efficiency  ap. 87-92.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aIntercountry cross‐section comparison of total productivity in agriculture showed that differences in production efficiency were small relative to differences in labor productivity among countries at a same stage of economic development but very large among different stages of development.

However, opportunistic infections can develop during combination immunosuppressive regimens. This case series describes atypical fungal infections in eight dogs treated with immunosuppressive dosages of glucocorticoids and ciclosporin. The median duration of combined treatment prior to the identification of fungal infection was 31 (range, 13 to 201) days, although two dogs received glucocorticoids for prolonged periods prior to the addition of ciclosporin. The estimated prevalence of serious fungal infections with this drug combination appears to be low (approximately 1 · 67%), but these infections led directly or indirectly to death or euthanasia in five of eight (63%) dogs. These cases highlight the need for frequent clinical monitoring of dogs receiving immunosuppressive dosages of glucocorticoids and ciclosporin.  aPublisher supplied data 3acyclosporine 3adeath 3adog diseases 3adogs 3aeuthanasia 3afungi 3aglucocorticoids 3amonitoring 3amycoses1 aWebb, J.1 aFoster, J.

A total of 260 samples from five stations along the coast of Tunisia were evaluated. The results highlight that only 28 residues (12 polychlorobiphenyls, 8 organochlorine pesticides, 7 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and triphenyl phosphate) were detected at levels higher than relative LOQ values. The amounts in sediment samples were compared with Sediment Quality Guidelines (SQGs) showing that the values are acceptable and no toxic effect is expected on aquatic organisms. A little variation of contaminant residues in sediment samples among coastal stations was recorded. Namely, with respect to almost all polychlorobiphenyls and organochlorine pesticides, higher values were recorder in summer. With respect to almost all polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, higher values were recorder in autumn. Aquatic plant leaves showed a residue accumulation higher than that of other compartments of marine system.

A two‐step procedure leading to a permanent urinary diversion was performed. During the same procedure, the caudal pelvic urethra and mass were resected and an extrapelvic anastomosis of the pelvic portion of the urethra to its penile portion was performed after passage of the pelvic urethra through the inguinal canal. The procedure successfully produced a tension‐free end‐to‐end urethral anastomosis and no complications were observed during the postoperative period. Histologically, the lesion was reported as a narrowly excised liposarcoma. A 4‐week course of curative intent of radiotherapy was initiated 2 weeks after surgery. Eight months later, the dog was free of clinical signs.  aPublisher supplied data 3acell biology 3acomputed tomography 3adogs 3amales 3aradiotherapy 3asarcoma 3asurgery 3aurethra1 aBemelmans, I.1 aBenoit, J.0 tjournal of small animal practice.g2016 Feb., v. 57, no. 2 p.100-104dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0022-45107nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jsap.124033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03664naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245007300159300001800232520188700250592002802137650002602165650001802191650003202209650001302241650002702254650002602281650001402307650002602321650001602347650002002363650001802383650001102401650001402412650001402426650001702440650002102457700001602478700002002494700002102514700002302535700003102558700002102589700001702610700001802627700002202645700002002667700001902687700002102706700002302727700001902750700001902769700002002788700002402808773013402832856007502966852000903041655001203050IND60794466720221122234926.0220923e20220921xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079446672DNAL7 a10.1039/d2np00012a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKrome, Anna K.10aCorallopyronin A: antimicrobial discovery to preclinical development  ap. 1705-1720.  aWorldwide, increasing morbidity and mortality due to antibiotic-resistant microbial infections has been observed. Therefore, better prevention and control of infectious diseases, as well as appropriate use of approved antibacterial drugs are crucial. There is also an urgent need for the continuous development and supply of novel antibiotics. Thus, identifying new antibiotics and their further development is once again a priority of natural product research. The antibiotic corallopyronin A was discovered in the 1980s in the culture broth of the Myxobacterium Corallococcus coralloides and serves, in the context of this review, as a show case for the development of a naturally occurring antibiotic compound. The review demonstrates how a hard to obtain, barely water soluble and unstable compound such as corallopyronin A can be developed making use of sophisticated production and formulation approaches. Corallopyronin A is a bacterial DNA-dependent RNA polymerase inhibitor with a new target site and one of the few representatives of this class currently in preclinical development. Efficacy against Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogens, e.g., Chlamydia trachomatis, Orientia tsutsugamushi, Staphylococcus aureus, and Wolbachia has been demonstrated. Due to its highly effective in vivo depletion of Wolbachia, which are essential endobacteria of most filarial nematode species, and its robust macrofilaricidal efficacy, corallopyronin A was selected as a preclinical candidate for the treatment of human filarial infections. This review highlights the discovery and production optimization approaches for corallopyronin A, as well as, recent preclinical efficacy results demonstrating a robust macrofilaricidal effect of the anti-Wolbachia candidate, and the solid formulation strategy which enhances the stability as well as the bioavailability of corallopyronin A.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChlamydia trachomatis 3aCorallococcus 3aDNA-directed RNA polymerase 3aNematoda 3aOrientia tsutsugamushi 3aStaphylococcus aureus 3aWolbachia 3aantibiotic resistance 3aantibiotics 3abioavailability 3aculture media 3ahumans 3amorbidity 3amortality 3amyxobacteria 3awater solubility1 aBecker, Tim1 aKehraus, Stefan1 aSchiefer, Andrea1 aGütschow, Michael1 aChaverra-Muñoz, Lillibeth1 aHüttel, Stephan1 aJansen, Rolf1 aStadler, Marc1 aEhrens, Alexandra1 aPogorevc, Domen1 aMüller, Rolf,1 aHübner, Marc P.1 aHesterkamp, Thomas1 aPfarr, Kenneth1 aHoerauf, Achim1 aWagner, Karl G.1 aKönig, Gabriele M.0 tNatural product reports.g2022 Sept. 21, v. 39, no. 9 p.1705-1720dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26900x1460-47527nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d2np00012a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03187naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002100146245010400167500001400271520179400285592002802079650002102107650001302128650001402141650002602155650001402181650001602195650001102211650002202222650002202244650001702266650001102283650001202294650002102306650002702327650001502354650001702369650002202386650001202408650001602420650001002436700002502446700002302471773012202494856008002616852000902696655001202705IND60724378820221120194549.0210122e20201228xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072437882DNAL7 a10.3390/agronomy110100452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWójcik, Danuta 10aField Performance and Genetic Stability of Micropropagated Gooseberry Plants (Ribes grossularia L.)  aNAL-light  aGooseberry (Ribes grossularia L.) is a small fruit crop producing valuable fruits, which is constantly gaining importance. In vitro propagation of this species can significantly support the production of virus-free planting material and accelerate the introduction of new cultivars to the market. The aim of presented study was to assess field performance and genetic stability of micropropagated plants (MPs) of four gooseberry cultivars, “Captivator”, “Hinnonmaki Rot”, “Invicta”, and “Resika”. The growth vigor and yield of MPs and plants propagated by standard methods from softwood cuttings (ST) were evaluated in a field experiment. Microscopic observations of the number and length of the stomata of MP and ST plants were carried out. Two DNA-based techniques, amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) and inter simple sequence repeat (ISSR), were used to assess genetic stability of MP plants. For analysis of genetic stability of ST plants, the ISSR technique was applied. For three cultivars, Captivator, Hinnonmaki Rot, and Invicta, the plants’ growth vigor and fruit yield were greater in MP plants than in ST plants. In the case of Resika, most of these parameters were higher in ST plants. Microscopic observations of the stomata indicated a lack of differences in the length between MP and ST plants, while the stomata frequency on leaves of MP plants was higher than that of ST plants. The genetic variability of MP plants, assessed by AFLP, ranged from 0.35% for Hinnonmaki Rot to 2.12% for Resika. The results of ISSR analysis of MP plants showed variability from 0% in the case of Hinnonmaki Rot and Resika to 4% and 8.69% for Captivator and Invicta, respectively. No polymorphism was detected among ST plants of all analyzed gooseberry cultivars.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRibes uva-crispa 3aagronomy 3acultivars 3afield experimentation 3afrequency 3afruit yield 3afruits 3agenetic stability 3agenetic variation 3agooseberries 3alength 3amarkets 3amicropropagation 3amicrosatellite repeats 3amicroscopy 3apolymorphism 3asoftwood cuttings 3astomata 3avariability 3avigor1 aTrzewik, Aleksandra 1 aKucharska, Danuta 0 tAgronomy.g2020 Dec. 28, v. 11, no. 1dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:12361x2073-43957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agronomy110100453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03370naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094024002200122024001900144040001800163100002300181245015800204506007600362520200700438592002802445506003702473650001602510650001202526650002002538650002202558650000902580650001302589650001602602700002502618700003002643700003302673700002902706700003102735773012302766856007402889852000902963655001202972IND60650603520221207081628.0190710e20181017xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065060352DNAL7 a10.3390/nu101015262doi7 aPMC62135872pmcid7 a303365982pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMielgo-Ayuso, Juan10aEleven Weeks of Iron Supplementation Does Not Maintain Iron Status for an Entire Competitive Season in Elite Female Volleyball Players: A Follow-Up Study  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBackground: Even though iron supplementation can be effective, it is necessary to be cautious of toxicity and aim to do no harm, therefore, it is important to examine the length of time the benefits of iron supplementation can be maintained following its cessation. The main purpose of this study was to analyze if iron stores and strength performance were maintained in elite female volleyball players for the final 18 weeks of a competitive season following the cessation of 11 weeks of iron supplementation. Methods: Twenty-two volleyballers (age: 27.0 &plusmn; 5.6 years.) were assigned to two groups (iron treatment group-ITG, n = 11 or control gropu-CG, n = 11) at the beginning of a previous trial (T0) and ITG consumed 325mg/d of ferrous sulphate for 11 weeks (T11). Then, in the present study iron status and strength were measured again 10 (T21) and 18 weeks later (T29) after the cessation of supplementation. Results: At the end of the previous trial (T11), ITG maintained iron status as measured by hematological parameters (serum iron-sFE, serum ferritin-FER, transferrin saturation index-TSI, and hemogloblin-Hb), however, CG showed a decrease in these markers at T11. Further, from T0 to T11 ITG experienced greater (p < 0.05) changes in clean and jerk, power clean, and total mean strength (TMS-sum of all strength tests) than CG. In the present, follow-up investigation, there was a group-by-time interaction in favor of CG vs. ITG from T11 to T21 for FER (p = 0.028) and Hb (p = 0.042). Further, there was an increase for CG (p < 0.001) in power clean for CG from T11 (38.4 &plusmn; 1.7 kg) to T21 (41.3 &plusmn; 1.9 kg) and T29 (41.8 &plusmn; 1.7 kg), but no change for power clean in ITG (p > 0.05). A group-by-time interaction from T11 to T29 occurred in favor of CG for half-squat (p = 0.049) and TMS (p = 0.049). Conclusion: Our findings suggest that the benefits of iron supplementation are not sustained in elite female volleyballers if supplementation is ceased for 18 weeks.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3ablood serum 3afemales 3aferrous sulfate 3ahematologic tests 3airon 3atoxicity 3atransferrin1 aZourdos, Michael  C.1 aCalleja González, Julio,1 aCórdova Martínez, Alfredo,1 aFernandez-Lázaro, Diego1 aCaballero-García, Alberto0 tNutrients.g2018 Oct. 17, v. 10, no. 10dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2271x2072-66437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu101015263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04017naa a2200721 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005700148245020400205500001900409520205700428592002802485650002202513650002002535650001002555650000902565650000902574650001102583650002502594653000802619653000702627653000902634653000802643653000802651653000802659653000702667653001302674653000802687653000802695653000902703653000902712653000902721653000702730653000902737653000902746653000802755653000802763653000802771653000702779653000802786653000802794653001102802653000802813653000802821653000702829653002302836653001802859653005802877653002602935653003202961653002602993700002003019700002103039700001903060700002403079773008803103856008303191852000903274655001203283IND60687914520221121175337.0200427e20200615xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068791452DNAL7 a10.1016/j.gene.2020.1446062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHori, Naohiro1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4209-607410aOCT3/4-binding sequence-dependent maintenance of the unmethylated state of CTCF-binding sequences with DNA demethylation and suppression of de novo DNA methylation in the H19 imprinted control region  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aDNA demethylation and suppression of de novo DNA methylation are activities that maintain an unmethylated state. However, the strength of these two activities at the same locus has not been estimated separately. Furthermore, the association between these two activities and the unmethylated state remains unclear. Octamer-binding transcription factor-binding sequences (OBSs) and CCCTC-binding factor-binding sequences (CBSs) within the mouse H19-imprinted control region (ICR) are involved in the induction of DNA demethylation and maintenance of the unmethylated state in mouse undifferentiated embryonic cell lines. To reveal the association between the two cis-elements and the two unmethylated state maintenance activities in maintaining the unmethylated state of the ICR, we evaluated the altered DNA methylation levels at sites that were initially methylated or unmethylated using a stable transfection-based assay, and estimated the strength of the two unmethylated state maintenance activities separately via a Poisson process model that described the DNA methylation state regulatory process. Although DNA demethylation depending on OBSs affected almost the entire ICR, DNA demethylation depending on CBSs occurred near CBSs, resulting in redundant demethylation of CBS regions. Detailed analysis of the CBS4 region suggested that OBSs were required to induce unmethylated state maintenance activities, and that CBSs-dependent activities contributed, but diminished, during incubation when protection of the CBS4 region by OBSs-dependent activities was absent. Analysis via the Poisson process model indicated that the unmethylated state at the CBS4 region was maintained by OBSs-dependent suppression of de novo DNA methylation rather than DNA demethylation. We propose that the hierarchical regulation of redundant protection of the CBS region via cooperation between the two unmethylated state maintenance activities is a potential function of the ICR that effectively maintains allele-specific methylation status in the same DNA sequence.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA demethylation 3aDNA methylation 3agenes 3aloci 3amice 3amodels 3anucleotide sequences 0aCBS 0aCm 0aCTCF 0aDSB 0aECC 0aESC 0aFI 0aG27-mean 0aGFP 0aICR 0aIgf2 0aλme 0aλde 0aMI 0aMIme 0aMIun 0aOBS 0aOCm 0aOct 0aOm 0aSox 0aRFU 0aROSA26 0aSOM 0aZBS 0aWT 0aCis-acting element 0aSox-Oct motif 0aOctamer-binding transcription factor-binding sequence 0aCTCF-binding sequence 0aDirect bisulfite sequencing 0aPoisson process model1 aKubo, Hidekazu,1 aSakasegawa, Taku1 aSakurai, Chiye1 aHatsuzawa, Kiyotaka0 tGene.g2020 June 15, v. 743 p.144606-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6378x0378-11197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gene.2020.1446063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01715naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100001800137245005100155300001400206500002000220520066200240592002800902650002700930650001100957650002200968650001300990650001101003650001101014650001801025650000901043650001901052651001101071651001801082700002001100773014101120856007101261852000901332655001201341IND60680320820221119183511.0200105e198502  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068032082DNAL7 a10.2307/12408212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCarter, C.

Full cost and revenue data from cattle custom fed in the three prairie provinces were used in this paper. The strategies tested were typical of those a custom feeder could use to attempt to reduce output price risk. The results indicate that hedging cattle in Canada is more complex than previous literature suggests.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural economics 3acattle 3acommodity futures 3afeedlots 3aincome 3aprices 3aprofitability 3arisk 3arisk reduction 3aCanada 3aUnited States1 aLoyns, R.

Xenopus skin graft rejection provides an excellent platform to study the ability of gp96 to elicit classical MHC class Ia (class Ia) restricted T cell responses. Additionally, the Xenopus model system also provides an attractive alternative to mice for exploring the ability of gp96 to generate responses against tumors that have down-regulated their class Ia molecules thereby escaping immune surveillance. Recently, we have developed an adoptive cell transfer assay in Xenopus clones using peritoneal leukocytes as antigen presenting cells (APCs), and shown that gp96 can prime CD8 T cell responses in vivo against minor histocompatibility skin antigens as well as against the Xenopus thymic tumor 15/0 that does not express class Ia molecules. We describe here the methodology involved to perform these assays including the elicitation, pulsing and adoptive transfer of peritoneal leukocytes, as well as the skin graft and tumor transplantation assays. Additionally we are also describing the harvesting and separation of peripheral blood leukocytes used for flow cytometry and proliferation assays which allow for further characterization of the effector populations involved in skin rejection and anti-tumor responses.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCD8-positive T-lymphocytes 3aXenopus laevis 3aadjuvants 3aantigen-presenting cells 3aantigens 3aclones 3aflow cytometry 3afrogs 3agraft rejection 3aharvesting 3aheat shock proteins 3ain vivo studies 3amice 3amodels 3amonitoring 3aneoplasms1 aCruz-Luna, Tanya1 aMcPherson, Pamela1 aRobert, Jacques0 tJournal of visualized experiments.g2010 Sept. 16, , no. 43 p.e2026-e2026dJournal of Visualized ExperimentswJournal:jnl4469330x1940-087X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3791/20263Available from publisher's site  uhttp://www.jove.com/video/2026/comparative-vivo-study-gp96-adjuvanticity-frog-xenopus  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03186naa a2200661 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024004300113040001800156100001800174245011600192300001800308500001500326520111400341592002801455650001601483650001901499650002201518650001201540650001301552650001601565650001801581650001101599650001401610650001601624650001901640650001301659650002001672650001501692650002301707650001301730650003401743650002701777650002201804650003301826650003101859650002001890650003501910650002301945650002101968650002601989650003502015650005302050650002602103650007002129653002402199653002502223653002602248653002402274653002102298700001702319773007802336856008902414852000902503655001202512IND60112220320221119210009.0160901e201308  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011222032DNAL7 a237354882pmid7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2013.05.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKumar, Ramesh12aA membrane-integrated advanced scheme for treatment of industrial wastewater: Dynamic modeling towards scale up  ap. 1375-1382.  a2019-12-04  aModeling and simulation was carried out for an advanced membrane-integrated hybrid treatment process that ensures reuse of water with conversion and recovery of ammoniacal nitrogen as value-added struvite fertilizer from coke wastewater. While toxic cyanide was largely removed in a pre-chemical treatment unit using Fenton’s reagents under optimized conditions, more than 95% of NH4+–N could be recovered as a valuable by-product called struvite through addition of appropriate doses of magnesium and phosphate salts. Water could be turned reusable through a polishing treatment by nanofiltration membranes in a largely fouling free membrane module following a biodegradation step. Mathematical modeling of such an integrated process was done with Haldane–Andrew approach for the associated microbial degradation of phenol by Pseudomonas putida. Residual NH4+ was degraded by nitrification and denitrification following the modified Monod kinetics. The model could successfully predict the plant performance as reflected in reasonably low relative error (0.03–0.18) and high Willmott d-index (>0.98).  aPublisher supplied data 3awater reuse 3adynamic models 3asimulation models 3afouling 3anitrogen 3afertilizers 3anitrification 3aphenol 3amagnesium 3avalue added 3abiodegradation 3atoxicity 3adenitrification 3awastewater 3aPseudomonas putida 3acyanides 2aBiodegradation, Environmental 2aChemical Precipitation 2aEquipment Failure 2aHydrogen Peroxidexchemistry 2aIndustrial Wastexanalysis 2aIronxchemistry 2aMagnesium Compoundsxchemistry 2aModels, Biological 2aModels, Chemical 2aPhosphatesxchemistry 2aPseudomonas putidaxmetabolism 2aWaste Disposal, Fluidxinstrumentationxmethods. 2aWastewaterxanalysis. 2aWater Pollutants, Chemicalxisolation & purificationxmetabolism. 0amathematical models 0aWastewater treatment 0aMathematical modeling 0aAquatic environment 0aAdvanced process1 aPal, Parimal0 tChemosphere.g2013 Aug., v. 92 p.1375-1382dElsevier Ltdx0045-65357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2013.05.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02129naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005700148245003900205300001800244500001100262520099400273592002801267650001501295650002401310650001301334650001601347650001901363650001101382650002001393650001701413700001901430700001801449700002101467700002601488773014901514856008301663852000901746655001201755IND60733772820221120142205.0211002e202104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073377282DNAL7 a10.1007/s00018-020-03739-w2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVitorino, Rui1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3636-580510aWhat can urinary exosomes tell us?  ap. 3265-3283.  aReview  aExosomes are involved in a wide variety of biochemical processes in human body homeostasis. Exosomes also provide important information regarding communications among several organ systems. Additionally, they can serve as molecular vehicles to deliver drugs. Therefore, exosomes have received wide attention in current biomedical research for unraveling pathogenic mechanisms of diseases, searching for novel biomarkers, and discovering new drugs. This paper reviews and discusses the significance of urinary exosomes for a better understanding of human disease pathophysiology and their potential use as therapeutic targets. Isolation methods of exosomes and the latest technological advances are also discussed. Furthermore, novel urinary exosomal biomarkers are highlighted with special emphasis on their clinical applicability (particularly sensitivity, specificity, reliability, and other aspects). Finally, future trends for this field are analyzed and our perspectives are provided.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiomarkers 3abiomedical research 3aexosomes 3ahomeostasis 3ahuman diseases 3ahumans 3apathophysiology 3atherapeutics1 aFerreira, Rita1 aGuedes, Sofia1 aAmado, Francisco1 aThongboonkerd, Visith0 tCellular and molecular life sciences.g2021 Apr., v. 78, no. 7 p.3265-3283dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl55291x1420-682X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00018-020-03739-w3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01676naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100001900137245009200156300001600248500002000264520062200284592002800906650001900934650001200953650002700965650001200992650001201004650001501016650001301031650001801044700002001062700002201082773014201104856007101246852000901317655001201326IND60680321020221119183746.0200105e198505  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068032102DNAL7 a10.2307/12406722doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFrench, Ben C.10aPlanting and Removal Relationships for Perennial Crops: An Application to Cling Peaches  ap. 215-223.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aSupply response for a perennial crop is influenced by the age composition of existing plant stocks which, in turn, is determined by historical patterns of plantings and removals.

Specimens of the fishes (omnivorous/herbivorous and carnivorous) were collected along the Doce River channel and its affluent Guandú River, and in different lakes and coastal lagoons adjacent to the river channel, in the Espirito Santo State, Southeast of Brazil. Four sampling collections were carried out over two years (2018 to 2020, during dry and rainy seasons). For both trophic groups the biomarkers responses indicated physiological alterations related to metals exposure and showed strong seasonal variations. The principal component analysis and integrated biomarker response index showed that DNA damage and lipid peroxidation were more associated with dry season 2 (Sep/Oct 2019) and the oxidative damage in proteins, metallothioneins concentration and the activity of superoxide dismutase in the gills showed a greater association with rainy season 2 (Jan/Feb 2020). On the other hand, the enzymes of energy metabolism, catalase and histological damage in the liver and the gills, were more associated with the dry and rainy campaigns of the first year of monitoring. The multivariate approach also suggested a temporal intensification in the bioaccumulation of metals and biological effects in the lacustrine environments. Thus, these results demonstrate that the release of mineral residues from the rupture of the Fundão mine dam affects the health status of the fish from the Doce River basin, provoking metals bioaccumulation, hepatic and branchial damage in the fish besides inducing of enzyme activity related to metal contamination, even four years after the rupture.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA damage 3abioaccumulation 3abiomarkers 3acarnivores 3acatalase 3adry season 3aecotoxicology 3aenergy metabolism 3aenvironment 3aenzyme activity 3afish communities 3afreshwater fish 3ahealth status 3aherbivores 3ahistology 3ahistopathology 3alipid peroxidation 3aliver 3aomnivores 3aprincipal component analysis 3arivers 3asuperoxide dismutase 3awatersheds 3awet season 3aBrazil 0aMulti-biomarkers 0aOxidative stress 0aEnvironmental monitoring 0aDoce River 0aLakes 0aLagoons1 aMarques, Joseane Aparecida1 ada Silva, Niumaique Gonçalves1 aBevitório, Lorena Ziviani1 aZebral, Yuri Dornelles1 aMaraschi, Anieli Cristina1 aCosta, Simone Rutz1 aCosta, Patricia Gomes1 aDamasceno, Eduardo Medeiros1 aPirovani, Juliana Castro Monteiro1 ado Vale-Oliveira, Maysa1 aSouza, Marta Marques1 ade Martinez Gaspar Martins, Camila1 aBianchini, Adalto1 aSandrini, Juliana Zomer0 tScience of the total environment.g2022 Aug. 01, v. 832 p.154878-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.1548783Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02837naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001400150245015400164300002000318520133200338592002801670596009801698596010101796596005101897650002501948650002601973650001601999650001102015650001802026650001402044650001302058650001902071700001302090700001502103700001302118700001602131700005402147773013202201856008502333852000902418655001202427IND60795274620221118055045.0221004e20220919xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079527462DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.analchem.2c022602doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Rui10aRational Design of Novel Lipophilic Aggregation-Induced Emission Probes for Revealing the Dynamics of Lipid Droplets during Lipophagy and Ferroptosis  ap. 13432-13439.  aLipid droplets (LDs), as crucial organelles, play a significant role in some physiological processes. Monitoring the concentration of LDs and dynamic behaviors between LDs and other organelles during some physiological processes is important for studying their biological function and medical diagnosis. Herein, we report a series of aggregation-induced emission (AIE) probes AIE-Cbz-LD-Cₙ (n = 1, 3, 5, 7, OMe) based on the conjugation of quinoline-malononitrile (QM) and carbazole for tracking the dynamic changes of LDs and studying the association between LDs and lysosome/endoplasmic reticulum (ER). To our great delight, AIE-Cbz-LD-C₃, AIE-Cbz-LD-C₅, and AIE-Cbz-LD-C₇ could aggregate in LDs accurately and light up the LDs with good photostability. Among them, AIE-Cbz-LD-C₇ was used to visualize the interplay between LDs and lysosomes during lipophagy due to the excellent LD-specificity. We also succeeded in tracking the number of newborn LDs generated near the endoplasmic reticulum regions revealing that the number increased considerably during ferroptosis by using AIE-Cbz-LD-C₇, which supplies useful evidence for the hypothesis that LDs generate from the ER. We expect the probe AIE-Cbz-LD-C₇ would be a practical tool for tracking the physiological and pathological processes contacted with LDs.  aPublisher supplied data  a21974119cNational Natural Science Foundation of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001809  a2019JJ30020cNatural Science Foundation of?Hunan Provincedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100004735  a2020RC3046cHunan Provincedhttps://doi.org/NA 3aanalytical chemistry 3aendoplasmic reticulum 3aferroptosis 3alipids 3alipophilicity 3alysosomes 3aneonates 3aphotostability1 aLi, Zilu1 aPeng, Chao1 aWen, Lei1 aXiao, Lehui1 aLi, Yinhui1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3629-36560 tAnalytical chemistry.g2022 Sept. 19, v. 94, no. 39 p.13432-13439dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:jnl70375x1520-68827nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.analchem.2c022603Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03526naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245010800169500001900277520198500296592002802281650001502309650001102324650001602335650003102351650001002382650001502392650002402407650001402431650001102445650001102456650001402467650001602481650003102497650000902528650001102537653003202548653003302580653003102613653002702644653002002671700001802691700001402709700001502723700001802738700001902756700001702775773011002792856008502902852000902987655001202996IND60722091620221116182547.0210212e20210215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072209162DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envpol.2020.1162942doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Mengmeng10aSpatiotemporal differences in phosphorus release potential of bloom-forming cyanobacteria in Lake Taihu  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe abnormal elevation of cyanobacterial density and total phosphorus concentration after the reduction of exogenous pollutants in Lake Taihu is still an open question. An in-situ light-dark bottle method was used to investigate the spatiotemporal differences of phosphorus release potential of bloom-forming cyanobacteria (BFC) in Lake Taihu. Generalized additive model analysis (GAM) of field data revealed that the phosphorus release potential of BFC increased with the upregulation of Chlorophyll a (Chl-a) content per cell, which was further validated by the laboratory experiment results. We deduced that the accumulation of Chl-a content per cell might be an essential index of high phosphorus release potential of BFC. The phosphorus release potential of BFC was much higher in summer and autumn than that in spring and winter, while the phosphorus absorption potential increased with the rising of temperature. The distinct physiological status of BFC at different seasons brought about their variation in phosphorus release potential. Additionally, high phosphorus release potential of BFC region mainly concentrated in the eastern and the central, northwest, western, and the south of Lake Taihu in spring, summer, autumn, and winter, respectively. Further studies showed that the spatial differences in phosphorus release potential of BFC were most probably due to the horizontal drift of BFC driven by the prevailing wind. Collectively, the synergism of BFC’s physiological status and horizontal drift determined the spatiotemporal differences of phosphorus release potential of BFC in Lake Taihu. Moreover, apparent spatiotemporal differences in phosphorus release potential of BFC were essential factors that induced the distinct distribution of total phosphorus in Lake Taihu. This study provides insight for exploring the reason for the constant increase of total dissolved phosphorus concentration and cyanobacterial density in Lake Taihu for the past 5 years.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3aautumn 3achlorophyll 3alaboratory experimentation 3alakes 3aphosphorus 3aphysiological state 3apollution 3aspring 3asummer 3asynergism 3atemperature 3atotal dissolved phosphorus 3awind 3awinter 0aBloom-forming cyanobacteria 0aPhosphorus release potential 0aSpatiotemporal differences 0aChl-a content per cell 0aPrevailing wind1 aZhang, Huifen1 aDu, Caili1 aZhang, Wei1 aShen, Jianing1 aYang, Shunqing1 aYang, Liuyan0 tEnvironmental pollution.g2021 Feb. 15, v. 271 p.116294-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl41014x0269-74917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2020.1162943Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02787naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001500151245011400166500001900280520131700299592002801616650001901644650001101663650001101674650002001685650001701705650001701722650001901739650001601758650000901774650001901783650001801802650002401820650002301844650001901867650001301886650002101899653000801920653001601928653001701944653003901961653002002000700001902020700001902039700001502058773011302073856008602186852000902272655001202281IND60723391920221120210025.0210226e20210505xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072339192DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhazmat.2020.1249292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMiao, Chen10aEffect of water-soluble thiourea formaldehyde (WTF) on soil contaminated with high copper (Ⅱ) concentration  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aIt is very important to seek a heavy metal soil stabilization/solidification (S/S) agent that has less risk of secondary release and has less impact on the soil. This study explored the repair effect of a new resin repair agent water-soluble thiourea-formaldehyde (WTF), and its stability under indigenous biodegradation and compared the repair effect with sodium sulfide (Na₂S) and hydroxyapatite (HAP). Diethylene triamine pentaacetic acid leaching experiments show that WTF can effectively solidify/stabilize 97.9–84.7% of Cu. At the same time, heavy metal speciation analysis experiments show that WTF does indeed convert the exchangeable Cu in the soil into a non-exchangeable form. Research on soil organic matter, biological carbon and enzyme activity after remediation shows that WTF has a more positive effect on soil function, compared with HAP and Na₂S. Experiments using indigenous microorganisms to decompose the precipitation formed by WTF and Cu show that under the condition of less impact on soil microorganisms, the risk of secondary release of heavy metals caused by soil microorganisms after WTF remediation is less. These findings provide valuable experience for understanding the role of resin structure in preventing the secondary release of heavy metals and restoring soil function.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiodegradation 3acarbon 3acopper 3aenzyme activity 3aformaldehyde 3aheavy metals 3ahydroxyapatite 3aremediation 3arisk 3asodium sulfide 3asoil function 3asoil organic matter 3asoil stabilization 3asolidification 3athiourea 3awater solubility 0aWTF 0aHeavy metal 0aCopper (Ⅱ) 0aStabilization/Solidification (S/S) 0aChelating resin1 aYao, Shan-Shan1 aLiu, She-Jiang1 aZhang, Kai0 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2021 May 05, v. 409 p.124929-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6200x0304-38947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2020.1249293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03045naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245019100166300001800357520163600375592002802011650002002039650002102059650001402080650002302094650002802117650001702145650001202162650001902174650003002193650002702223650001202250650002502262650002802287650001502315700001702330700001802347700002702365700002102392773010802413856008102521852000902602655001202611IND60449337220221118044741.0151031e201511  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6044933722DNAL7 a10.1007/s11033-015-3925-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGupta, Shefali10aDevelopment of gene-based markers for use in construction of the chickpea (Cicer arietinum L.) genetic linkage map and identification of QTLs associated with seed weight and plant height  ap. 1571-1580.  aSeed weight and plant height are important agronomic traits and contribute to seed yield. The objective of this study was to identify QTLs underlying these traits using an intra-specific mapping population of chickpea. A F₁₁ population of 177 recombinant inbred lines derived from a cross between SBD377 (100-seed weight- 48 g and plant height- 53 cm) and BGD112 (100-seed weight- 15 g and plant height- 65 cm) was used. A total of 367 novel EST-derived functional markers were developed which included 187 EST-SSRs, 130 potential intron polymorphisms (PIPs) and 50 expressed sequence tag polymorphisms (ESTPs). Along with these, 590 previously published markers including 385 EST-based markers and 205 genomic SSRs were utilized. Of the 957 markers tested for analysis of parental polymorphism between the two parents of the mapping population, 135 (14.64 %) were found to be polymorphic. Of these, 131 polymorphic markers could be mapped to the 8 linkage groups. The linkage map had a total length of 1140.54 cM with an average marker density of 8.7 cM. The map was further used for QTL identification using composite interval mapping method (CIM). Two QTLs each for seed weight, qSW-1 and qSW-2 (explaining 11.54 and 19.24 % of phenotypic variance, respectively) and plant height, qPH-1 and qPH-2 (explaining 13.98 and 12.17 % of phenotypic variance, respectively) were detected. The novel set of genic markers, the intra-specific linkage map and the QTLs identified in the present study will serve as valuable genomic resources in improving the chickpea seed yield using marker-assisted selection (MAS) strategies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCicer arietinum 3aagronomic traits 3achickpeas 3achromosome mapping 3aexpressed sequence tags 3ainbred lines 3aintrons 3alinkage groups 3amarker-assisted selection 3amicrosatellite repeats 3aparents 3aphenotypic variation 3aquantitative trait loci 3aseed yield1 aKumar, Tapan1 aVerma, Subodh1 aBharadwaj, Chellapilla1 aBhatia, Sabhyata0 tMolecular biology reports.g2015 Nov., v. 42, no. 11 p.1571-1580dSpringer Netherlandsx0301-48517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11033-015-3925-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03223naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245013800168300001400306520173900320592002802059650002802087650002502115650002302140650001502163650001402178650001302192650002102205650001502226650001502241650001502256650001402271650001102285650002202296651001002318653001102328653002302339653002302362653001302385653001602398653001402414653003102428653002002459700002002479700002502499773010202524856008202626852000902708655001202717IND60517206020221120153227.0190728e201401  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051720602DNAL7 a10.1017/S00306053120013302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWoodhouse, Emily10aFungal gold and firewood on the Tibetan plateau: examining access to diverse ecosystem provisioning services within a rural community  ap. 30-38.  aProvisioning ecosystem services include wild products that form an integral part of rural economies. Using quantitative and qualitative data from semi-structured interviews with 50 households in a Tibetan community in Western Sichuan, China, we explored the relationships of households with three diverse provisioning services on the Eastern Tibetan plateau: firewood, medicinal caterpillar fungus Ophiocordyceps sinensis and matsutake mushrooms Tricholoma matsutake. We examined (1) how they contribute to wealth and livelihoods, (2) what determines household access, and (3) how local use has changed over time. All households were reliant on firewood, and levels extracted were explained only by household size. A more complex set of factors explained access to caterpillar fungus: younger, larger, pastoralist households with lower dependency ratios tended to collect more, and education and household size explained variation in price gained for the product. Caterpillar fungus extraction has dramatically increased over the last 20 years, providing up to 72% of household income, but poorer households have received significantly less of their income from the fungus. Matsutake contributed much less to livelihoods because of its relatively low price. The results show a contrast between subsistence and market-driven products: access to the latter is affected by competition and power relationships. Overall access to provisioning services was related to facets of wealth, especially human capital. The study contributes a household level analysis of the diverse provisioning value of an under-researched part of the world, highlighting the heterogeneity and dynamism of the relationships of households with ecosystem services.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOphiocordyceps sinensis 3aTricholoma matsutake 3aecosystem services 3aecosystems 3aeducation 3afuelwood 3ahousehold income 3ahouseholds 3ainterviews 3alivelihood 3amushrooms 3aprices 3arural communities 3aChina 0aAccess 0acaterpillar fungus 0aecosystem services 0afirewood 0alivelihoods 0amatsutake 0anon-timber forest products 0aTibetan plateau1 aMcGowan, Philip1 aMilner-Gulland, E.J.0 tOryx.g2014 Jan., v. 48, no. 1 p.30-38dCambridge University PresswJournal:1955x1365-30087nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S00306053120013303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03245naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094024002200125024001900147040001800166100003400184245018500218506007600403520152500479592002802004506003702032650002202069650003002091650001202121650002202133650002602155650001802181650001002199650001202209650002002221650002702241650001702268650001502285650002502300650001202325650000902337651001402346700002302360700001902383700001802402700001902420700001902439700002502458700002602483773012002509856007702629852000902706655001202715IND60670083420221207131124.0190925e20190919xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067008342DNAL7 a10.3390/genes100907292doi7 aPMC67709962pmcid7 a315469732pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aThavornkanlapachai, Rujiporn 10aMixing Genetically and Morphologically Distinct Populations in Translocations: Asymmetrical Introgression in A Newly Established Population of the Boodie (<i>Bettongia lesueur</i>)  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe use of multiple source populations provides a way to maximise genetic variation and reduce the impacts of inbreeding depression in newly established translocated populations. However, there is a risk that individuals from different source populations will not interbreed, leading to population structure and smaller effective population sizes than expected. Here, we investigate the genetic consequences of mixing two isolated, morphologically distinct island populations of boodies (Bettongia lesueur) in a translocation to mainland Australia over three generations. Using 18 microsatellite loci and the mitochondrial D-loop region, we monitored the released animals and their offspring between 2010 and 2013. Despite high levels of divergence between the two source populations (F<inf>ST</inf> = 0.42 and ϕ<inf>ST</inf> = 0.72), there was clear evidence of interbreeding between animals from different populations. However, interbreeding was non-random, with a significant bias towards crosses between the genetically smaller-sized Barrow Island males and the larger-sized Dorre Island females. This pattern of introgression was opposite to the expectation that male&ndash;male competition or female mate choice would favour larger males. This study shows how mixing diverged populations can bolster genetic variation in newly established mammal populations, but the ultimate outcome can be difficult to predict, highlighting the need for continued genetic monitoring to assess the long-term impacts of admixture.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aBettongia lesueur 3aeffective population size 3afemales 3agenetic variation 3ainbreeding depression 3aintrogression 3amales 3amammals 3amating behavior 3amicrosatellite repeats 3amitochondria 3amonitoring 3apopulation structure 3aprogeny 3arisk 3aAustralia1 aMills, Harriet  R.1 aOttewell, Kym 1 aDunlop, Judy 1 aSims, Colleen 1 aMorris, Keith 1 aDonaldson, Felicity 1 aKennington, W.

Flying squirrel species exhibit group nesting in winter, which may put them at risk of extirpation in small patches with few individuals to contribute to group nests. Flying squirrels are also volant, potentially making non-treed matrix a barrier. Our surveys revealed that G. sabrinus was most likely to occur in large patches that were embedded in landscapes with low connectivity, and least likely to occur in small patches in highly connected landscapes. Conversely, G. volans was most likely to occur in large, well-connected patches and least likely to occur in small, unconnected patches. Patch occupancy by the cursorial squirrels was not strongly influenced by patch area or isolation. These findings reinforce previous studies suggesting that an understanding of species-specific traits such as behavior is an important consideration when interpreting habitat fragmentation effects.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGlaucomys sabrinus 3aGlaucomys volans 3aSciurus carolinensis 3aTamias striatus 3aTamiasciurus hudsonicus 3adeciduous forests 3ahabitat fragmentation 3ahabitats 3alandscapes 3anesting 3anests 3arisk 3asquirrels 3asurveys 3awinter 3aOntario1 aBowman, Jeff0 tActa theriologica.g2011 Jan., v. 56, no. 1 p.63-72dSpringer-Verlagx0001-70517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13364-010-0010-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03680naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100005700142245009400199300001800293500002000311520172500331592002802056596004302084596004502127596004502172596004502217596004502262596006402307596005302371650001502424650001502439650001302454650000802467650001302475650001102488650001302499650002202512651001102534700005802545700005502603700005502658700005702713700005102770700001502821700005802836700001702894700002102911773013202932856007703064852000903141655001203150IND60789547920221123011615.0220821e201809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078954792DNAL7 a10.1029/2017JF0045202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchild, K.

However, the physical melt processes influencing calving remain challenging to constrain. In this study we focus on calving rates at Kongsbreen, a tidewater glacier in Svalbard, due to three mechanisms of submarine melt: (1) free convection, (2) horizontal fjord circulation, and (3) meltwater discharge. To calculate an overall calving rate, we measure glacier velocity and terminus change using Sentinel imagery. We calculate free convection, fjord circulation, and meltwater discharge calving using mooring data for mid‐fjord ocean temperature (30–80 m depth), reanalysis results for meltwater runoff, and georectified time‐lapse imagery to track icebergs and infer surface circulation. Results show that the total glacier calving rate is highly correlated with ocean temperature during the 2016 melt season. When runoff was present, we found that subglacial discharge accounted for calving rates an order of magnitude greater than the maximum calving rates assigned to the other two melting mechanisms combined. Further, subglacial discharge at Kongsbreen was more efficient in inducing calving later in the season than earlier in the season, implying that the increase in ocean temperatures, the timing of meltwater discharge within a melt season, and/or the development of discrete meltwater exit channels are critical components to calving rates.

Knowledge of global mean sea level during this period is important as an indicator of possible future ice sheet retreat and sea level rise. However, local shoreline elevations can deviate from the eustatic mean by various geologic processes over the last 3 million years, including glacial isostatic adjustment of the solid Earth and gravitational field due to both Pliocene ice‐cover changes and more recent glacial cycles. Our coupled model includes glacial isostatic adjustment processes and simulates Antarctic ice sheet, global sea level, and solid Earth variations in the warmest mid‐Pliocene and over the last 40,000 years. Global maps of estimated modern elevations of Pliocene shoreline markers are produced for a standard radial profile of Earth viscosity and lithospheric thickness. Results are compared to an earlier study with an uncoupled Earth‐sea level model and a different methodology (Raymo et al., Nature Geoscience, 2011, https://doi.org:/10.1038/ngeo1118). As in that study, Pliocene shoreline elevations diverge significantly from the eustatic value in widespread regions, especially in the vicinity of present and former ice sheets. In some other regions, elevations are close to eustatic. The results emphasize that care should be taken in interpreting elevations of paleo‐shoreline markers.  aPublisher supplied data  cCanadian Foundation for Innovation  cNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)  aOCE‐1202632cNational Science Foundation  a1663693cNational Science Foundation  aGEO 1240507cNational Science Foundation  cMcGill University  cCanadian Foundation for Innovation  cCanada Research Chairs 3aPliocene epoch 3ageophysics 3aice 3aice cover 3amodels 3aresearch 3asea level 3ashorelines 3aviscosity 3aAntarctic region1 aGomez, N.1 aDeConto, R.

Globally, it affects around 14 million people living in undeveloped and developing countries. Leishmania, which is the causative eukaryotic organism, possesses unique enzymes and pathways that deviates from its mammalian hosts. The control strategy against leishmaniasis currently depends on chemotherapeutic methods. But these chemotherapeutic therapies possess several side effects, and therefore, the identification of potential drug targets has become very crucial. Identification of suitable drug targets is necessary to design specific inhibitors that can target and control the parasite. These unique enzymes can be used as possible drug targets after biochemical characterization and understanding the role of these enzymes. In this review, the authors discuss various metabolic pathways that are essential for the survival of the parasite and can be exploited as potential drug targets against leishmaniasis.  aPublisher supplied data  aYSS/2014/000147cScience and Engineering Research Board 3aLeishmania 3adrug therapy 3aleishmaniasis 3amammals 3aparasites 3aparasitology 3apeople 3aresearch 3atropical diseases1 aSasidharan, Santanu1 aBalaji, S.

This study focuses on investigating the synergies that exist in combining monoethanolamine (ETA) and sodium cocoyl alaninate (SCA) as an alkali–surfactant (AS) formulation for the enhanced oil recovery process. A conventional formulation made of sodium carbonate (Na₂CO₃) and sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) was used for a comparative purpose. The proposed formulation proved to be compatible with the prepared hard brine. The ETA–SCA combination proved superior to Na₂CO₃–SDS in interfacial tension (IFT) reduction and wettability alteration. Addition of ETA to SCA synergistically reduced IFT to a low value of 4.73 × 10–² mN/m at a surfactant concentration lower than the critical micelle concentration (CMC). ETA also played a synergistic role in improving the wetting power of SCA on quartz surface. The formulation also showed a high emulsifying ability owing to its superior IFT reduction capability. Static adsorption studies showed SCA to exhibit Langmuir-type adsorption behavior similar to SDS. The adsorption of SCA onto a sand surface was favorable, but ETA proved to reduce adsorption of SCA effectively at 0.3 wt %. The ETA–SCA and Na₂CO₃–SDS systems achieved additional oil recoveries of 31 and 25% original oil in place (OOIP) over conventional core flooding, respectively. The proposed AS formulation, therefore, showed better recovery potential in addition to its environmentally friendly nature.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3aenergy 3aethanolamine 3amicelles 3aoils 3aquartz 3asand 3asodium 3asodium carbonate 3asodium dodecyl sulfate 3asurface tension 3asurfactants 3awettability1 aAtta, Dennis Yaw1 aAyoub Mohammed, Mohammed Abdalla1 aOtchere, Daniel Asante0 tEnergy & fuels.g2021 June 30, v. 35, no. 14 p.11171-11192dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23338x1520-50297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.energyfuels.1c005513Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02555naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002300139245017300162500001900335520119200354592002801546650001301574650002801587650001601615650002401631650001401655650001801669650002501687650001801712651001201730651001001742700002801752700002001780700002301800700002201823700002101845700001901866700001801885700001701903773011901920856007302039852000902112655001202121IND60729509220221119153942.0210228e20210223xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072950922DNAL7 a10.3390/w130405612doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLovrinović, Ivan 10aGroundwater Monitoring Systems to Understand Sea Water Intrusion Dynamics in the Mediterranean: The Neretva Valley and the Southern Venice Coastal Aquifers Case Studies  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aSea water intrusion (SWI) has been widely recognized as a global problem, significantly influencing coastal aquifers, mostly through reduced water quality and agricultural production indicators. In this paper, we present the outcomes of the implementation of two independent real-time monitoring systems, planned and installed to get insights on groundwater dynamics within the adjacent coastal aquifer systems, one located in the Neretva Valley, southeastern Croatia, the other located south of the Venice lagoon, northeastern Italy. Both systems are presented with technical details and the capacity to observe, store, and transmit (Neretva site) observed values in real-time. Analysis of time series reveals the significant influence of the sea level oscillations onto the observed groundwater electrical conductivity (EC) and piezometric head values, while precipitation rate is detected as a driving mechanism for groundwater parameters in shallow geological units. The installed monitoring systems are shown to be of great importance to provide qualitative and quantitative information on the processes influencing groundwater and surface water dynamics within two coastal systems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaquifers 3aelectrical conductivity 3agroundwater 3asaltwater intrusion 3asea level 3asurface water 3atime series analysis 3awater quality 3aCroatia 3aItaly1 aBergamasco, Alessandro 1 aSrzić, Veljko 1 aCavallina, Chiara 1 aHoljević, Danko,1 aDonnici, Sandra 1 aErceg, Joško 1 aZaggia, Luca 1 aTosi, Luigi 0 tWater.g2021 Feb. 23, v. 13, no. 4dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21688x2073-44417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w130405613Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03064naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002400142245012800166300001600294520170600310592002802016650001802044650002302062650001802085650001802103650001002121650001502131650001302146650001602159650001102175650001402186650001402200650001602214650001402230651001502244653002802259653001602287653001902303653001602322653001702338653001302355700002002368773012002388856007702508852000902585655001202594IND60594551820221116174103.0180625s2017    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059455182DNAL7 a10.3955/046.091.04082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStephens, Connor W.13aAn Evaluation of Stand Age as a Factor of Mastication Efficiency and Effectiveness in the Central Sierra Nevada, California  ap. 389-398.  aUnderstanding costs and effectiveness of mechanical fuels treatments is essential for efficiently influencing fire behavior at the landscape scale. While the capability of mastication to mitigate the potential of high severity wildfire in mature stands has been studied, the variables that determine its efficiency across age classes have received far less attention. The objective of this study was to examine how stand age influenced the efficiency and effectiveness of mastication. Mastication was performed on stand ages and structures representative of those commonly observed in the mixed conifer forest of the Sierra Nevada. Machine data from spatial and motion sensors were used to assess machine efficiency, and fire modeling was used to evaluate treatment effectiveness. The stands masticated were 10, 33, and 100 years old. Machine operation time per hectare was shown to vary with stand age, with the 10 and 100-year-old stands less costly to treat than the 33-year-old stand. However, potential for high severity wildfire immediately following treatments was reduced to a much greater degree in the 33-year-old stand, whereas it increased for the 10-year-old stand and was unaffected in the 100-year-old stand. This study's findings suggest that masticating developing stands (i.e. those entering the stem exclusion phase), while relatively costly, may also provide managers with a big “bang for their buck” in reducing fire severity across the landscape. To assess longer-term effectiveness, it will be important to track predicted fire severity as masticated fuels decompose and as tree growth responds to the reduction in density following the treatments in stands of various ages.  aPublisher supplied data 3aage structure 3aconiferous forests 3afire behavior 3afire severity 3afuels 3alandscapes 3amanagers 3amastication 3amodels 3amountains 3astand age 3atree growth 3awildfires 3aCalifornia 0aforest fuels mitigation 0amastication 0aforest ecology 0arestoration 0afire hazards 0awildfire1 aYork, Robert A.0 tNorthwest science.g2017, v. 91, no. 4 p.389-398dWashington State University PresswJournal:19722x0029-344X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3955/046.091.04083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04280naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100006300139245010300202300001800305500001400323500002000337520220700357592002802564650002302592650001502615650001502630650002602645650001702671650001202688650002002700650001402720650001302734650001202747650001602759650001702775650001402792650001502806650001802821650001502839650001302854650002102867650002102888650001402909650001902923650001502942650001402957650001902971650001402990650001003004650001803014650001903032700006203051700006003113700005503173700006203228700006003290700006203350773013603412856007303548852000903621655001203630IND60718307920221119123100.0201124e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071830792DNAL7 a10.1111/geb.131962doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPrather, Rebecca M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3655-571610aMicronutrients enhance macronutrient effects in a meta‐analysis of grassland arthropod abundance  ap. 2273-2288.  aNAL-light  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aAIM: Ongoing alterations to Earth’s biogeochemical cycles (e.g., via fertilization, burning of fossil fuels, and pollution) are expected to impact plants, plant consumers and all subsequent trophic levels. While fertilization experiments often reveal arthropod nutrient limitation by nitrogen and phosphorus via effects on plant nutrient density and biomass, these macronutrients are only two of many nutrients important to arthropod fitness. Micronutrients are key to osmoregulation and enzyme function and can interact synergistically with macronutrients to shape the geography of arthropod abundance. We examine arthropod response to macro‐ and micronutrient fertilization as a function of nutrient type, application amount, duration, frequency, and plant responses to fertilization with the goal of addressing how ongoing alterations to biogeochemical cycles will shape future grassland food webs. LOCATION: Global. TIME PERIOD: 1987–2018. MAJOR TAXA STUDIED: Invertebrates. METHODS: We compiled a database of 62 studies to test the response of six arthropod trophic groups to multiple fertilizer types (compositions of varying macro‐ and micronutrients), quantities, application frequencies, and application durations. Additionally, we examined the role of plant nutrient content and biomass in mediating arthropod responses to fertilization. RESULTS: Micronutrients applied alone had no effects on plant biomass or arthropod abundance. However, when added with macronutrients, micronutrients amplified the effect of N, P and K in promoting arthropod abundance, a synergy that did not affect plant biomass. Micronutrients thus catalysed the ability of macronutrients to promote arthropod abundance across all guilds studied. MAIN CONCLUSIONS: In grasslands, the rules governing the abundance of autotrophs and their consumers appear to differ fundamentally in their response to Earth’s changing biogeochemistry. By revealing the importance of micronutrients for arthropods using a global dataset, we highlight a stoichiometric mismatch between limits of plants and arthropods for metal cations whose biogeochemistry, along with N and P, are being actively rearranged in the Anthropocene.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAnthropocene epoch 3aarthropods 3aautotrophs 3abiogeochemical cycles 3abiogeography 3aburning 3adata collection 3adatabases 3aduration 3aenzymes 3afertilizers 3afossil fuels 3afrequency 3agrasslands 3ameta-analysis 3ametal ions 3anitrogen 3anutrient content 3anutrient density 3anutrients 3aosmoregulation 3aphosphorus 3aphytomass 3aplant response 3apollution 3ashape 3astoichiometry 3atrophic levels1 aCastillioni, Karen1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9205-76311 aKaspari, Michael1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9717-57681 aSouza, Lara1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6005-86671 aPrather, Chelse M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4502-149X1 aReihart, Ryan W.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5708-45621 aWelti, Ellen A.

In this study, we describe a simple two‐stage model that accurately emulates the response to external forcing of marine‐terminating glaciers simulated in a spatially extended model. The simplicity of the model permits derivation of analytical expressions describing the marine‐terminating glacier response to forcing. We find that there are two time scales that characterize the stable glacier response to external forcing, a fast time scale of decades to centuries, and a slow time scale of millennia. These two time scales become unstable at different thresholds of bed slope, indicating that there are distinct slow and fast forms of the marine ice sheet instability. We derive simple expressions for the approximate magnitude and transient evolution of the stable glacier response to external forcing, which depend on the equilibrium glacier state and the strength of nonlinearity in forcing processes. The slow response rate of marine‐terminating glaciers indicates that current changes at some glaciers are set to continue and accelerate in coming centuries in response to past climate forcing and that the current extent of change at these glaciers is likely a small fraction of the future committed change caused by past climate forcing. Finally, we find that changing the amplitude of natural fluctuations in some nonlinear forcing processes, such as ice shelf calving, changes the equilibrium glacier state.  aPublisher supplied data  cDOC | NOAA | Climate Program Office (CPO)  aPLR-1643299cNSF | GEO | PLR | Polar Environment, Safety and Health Section (PESH) 3aclimate 3aevolution 3ageophysics 3aice 3aice shelf 3amodels 3aresearch 3aAntarctica 3aGreenland1 aRoe, Gerard H.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5906-47791 aHaseloff, Marianne1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6576-53840 tJournal of geophysical research.g2018 Sept., v. 123, no. 9 p.2205-2227dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:27941x2169-90037nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2018JF0047093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02443naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245010600171300001800277500001900295520144200314592002801756650001301784650001901797650001201816650002301828650001701851700006701868773011301935856008402048852000902132655001202141IND60698086920221120233646.0200609e20200515xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069808692DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.langmuir.0c005322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJamali, Mohammad10aMeasuring Force of Droplet Detachment from Hydrophobic Surfaces via Partial Cloaking with Ferrofluids  ap. 6116-6125.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThis paper presents a new approach to measure the force required to detach a water (a polar liquid) droplet from a hydrophobic surface. This is done by partially cloaking the droplet with a high-surface-tension oil-based ferrofluid and using a magnet to apply a controllable body force to the resulting compound droplet. Placing the assembly on a sensitive scale, the magnet can then be brought closer to the droplet to detach it from the surface while recording the forces applied to the droplet. The work presented here is novel as it uses the concept of partial cloaking in which the solid–droplet contact area is not contaminated by the ferrofluid (and the measured forces do not need postprocessing). Our study is accompanied by numerical simulations aimed at improving our understanding of the interplay between the interfacial forces in a two-phase droplet under the influence of a strong (detaching) body force and at providing additional data for in-depth analyses of these forces. In particular, the minimum ferrofluid volume required for successful water droplet detachment from hydrophobic surfaces is computed for ferrofluids of different surface tensions, and they are compared to experimental data obtained from detaching water droplets from electrospun polystyrene coatings. It is also shown that the detachment force measured via partial cloaking is independent of the volume of the ferrofluid used for the experiment.  aPublisher supplied data 3adroplets 3ahydrophobicity 3aliquids 3amagnetic materials 3apolystyrenes1 aTafreshi, Hooman Vahedi1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0689-66210 tLangmuir.g2020 May 15, v. 36, no. 22 p.6116-6125dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19170x1520-58277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.langmuir.0c005323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02786naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100002400141245014900165300001600314520107500330592002801405650002001433650002701453650001601480650001501496650001601511650001101527650002401538650001401562650002201576650001301598650001901611650001801630650001201648650001601660650001101676650001401687653001101701653002001712653002401732653001901756653001101775700001901786700002201805700002401827700001701851700002401868700002601892700002301918700002101941700002301962773013701985856007702122852000902199655001202208IND60131777020221119175736.0151127e201412  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013177702DNAL7 a10.1638/2014-0049.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDi Girolamo, Nicola10aComputed tomography–guided bone biopsies for evaluation of proliferative vertebral lesions in two boa constrictors (boa constrictor imperator)  ap. 973-978.  aTwo boa constrictors (Boa constrictor imperator) presented with paresis of the trunk originating cranial to the cloaca.

Computed tomography–guided biopsies of the lesions were performed without complications. Histology was consistent with bacterial osteomyelitis and osteoarthritis. Gram-negative bacteria (Salmonella sp. and Pseudomonas sp.) were isolated from cultures of the biopsies. Medical treatment with specific antibiotics was attempted for several weeks in both cases without clinical or radiographic improvements. The animals were euthanized, and necropsy confirmed the findings observed upon CT. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first report of the use of CT-guided biopsies to evaluate proliferative vertebral lesions in snakes.

The molds are spherical frozen micelles of polystyrene-b-poly(dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate) (PS-b-PDMAEMA) block copolymer in acidic aqueous solution with a PS spherical core surrounded by a corona of PDMAEMA chains in good solvent. The behavior of micelles is controlled by the [AuCl₄–]/[DMAEMA] ratio RAᵤCₗ₄–/DMAEMA. At low gold concentration, AuCl₄– ions condense on the positively charged DMAEMA moieties without changing the behavior of the PDMAEMA chains. At intermediate gold concentration, the ions induce a progressive contraction of the corona’s chains and dehydration of micelles. At large gold concentration, the corona becomes a fully dry phase loaded with gold ions, which induces micelle aggregation. Radiolysis of the solution by an intense X-ray beam produces different types of gold nanoparticles with respect to RAᵤCₗ₄–/DMAEMA and irradiation time. At RAᵤCₗ₄–/DMAEMA = 0.033, irradiation produces in the first step gold clusters in the micelle corona which in the second step merge to form nanoparticles of a similar size to that of the micelle. Conversely, at RAᵤCₗ₄–/DMAEMA = 0.33, micelles do not operate as templates but only as nucleation zones and large nanoparticles grow outside the micelles.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-radiation 3aX-ray scattering 3aaqueous solutions 3acomposite polymers 3agold 3aions 3airradiation 3amicelles 3amoieties 3ananogold 3ananoparticles 3aneutron diffraction 3aradiolysis 3asolvents1 aFontaine, Philippe1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3394-65081 aMuller, François,1 aPantoustier, Nadège1 aPerrin, Patrick1 aMorfin, Isabelle1 aGoldmann, Michel1 aCousin, F.q(Fabrice),1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7523-51600 tLangmuir.g2020 May 11, v. 36, no. 22 p.6132-6144dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19170x1520-58277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.langmuir.0c005543Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03168naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100003500148245013700183300001800320500001900338520147000357592002801827650002401855650001101879650001401890650001001904650001901914650001601933650001701949650001601966650001401982650001701996650001402013650003702027650002402064650001602088650001302104650002002117650002802137650001402165700002702179700003702206700002502243700003102268700003402299700002002333700002702353700002502380773013002405856008202535852000902617655001202626IND60699855520221119074013.0200623e202007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069985552DNAL7 a10.1007/s00436-020-06686-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 ado Patrocinio, Andressa Barban10aInhibition of 19S proteasome deubiquitinating activity in Schistosoma mansoni affects viability, oviposition, and structural changes  ap. 2159-2176.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe proteasome is the key player in the cellular protein degradation machinery and is pivotal for protein homeostasis and Schistosoma mansoni (S. mansoni) survival. Our group study provides insights into proteasome inhibitors and reveals that selective schistosomiasis agents represent an interesting branch of proteasome research linked to the development of new drugs for this neglected disease. Here, we explored the phenotypic response of S. mansoni to b-AP15, a bis-benzylidine piperidone that inhibits 26S proteasome deubiquitinases (DUBs), ubiquitin-specific protease 14 (USP14), and ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal hydrolase 5 (UCHL5). b-AP15 induces a modest decrease in egg production in vitro and reduces viability, leading to the death of parasite couples. This inhibitor also induces a twofold increase in the accumulation of polyubiquitinated proteins in S. mansoni adult worms and causes tegument changes such as disintegration, wrinkling, and bubble formation, both throughout the length of the parasite and in the oral sucker. b-AP15 alters the cell organelles of adult S. mansoni worms, and we specifically observed mitochondrial alterations, which are suggestive of proteotoxic stress leading to autophagy. Taken together, these results indicate that the deubiquitinase function of the proteasome is essential for the parasite and support the hypothesis that the proteasome constitutes an interesting drug target for the treatment of schistosomiasis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSchistosoma mansoni 3aadults 3aautophagy 3adeath 3aegg production 3ahomeostasis 3amitochondria 3aoviposition 3aparasites 3aparasitology 3aphenotype 3aproteasome endopeptidase complex 3aprotein degradation 3aproteinases 3aresearch 3aschistosomiasis 3aubiquitinyl hydrolase 1 3aviability1 aCabral, Fernanda Janku1 aBitencourt, André Luiz Brandão1 aBrigato, Olinda Mara1 aMagalhães, Lizandra Guidi1 ade Lima Paula, Lucas Antônio1 aFranco, Larissa1 aGuerra-Sá and, Renata1 aRodrigues, Vanderlei0 tParasitology research.g2020 July, v. 119, no. 7 p.2159-2176dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl3870072x0932-01137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00436-020-06686-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01824naa a2200265 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002400075024005100099040001800150100002100168245007100189300001600260500000900276500001500285520091600300592002801216650003001244650002701274653001701301773012101318852000901439856009801448655001201546991581462460742620221120143325.0191122e197503  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aCAIN7590504092DNAL7 a10.2135/cropsci1975.0011183X001500020038x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKappelman, A.

In greenhouse studies, seedlings were artificially inoculated with either mixtures or individual wilt isolates in the absence of nematodes. When a highly-virulent isolate of fusarium was used for greenhouse inoculations, results were highly correlated with those obtained under field conditions where nematodes and wilt were both present. Isolates of fusarium obtained from resistant or susceptible varieties were not always of high or low virulence, respectively. Therefore inoculum of known high virulence must be used in greenhouse tests for symptom expression to be correlated with that obtained under field conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3afungal diseases of plants 3aplant pathogenic fungi 0aplant health0 tCrop science.g1975 Mar., v. 15, no. 2 p.270-272dCrop Science Society of AmericawJournal:jnl44570x0011-183X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2135/cropsci1975.0011183X001500020038x3Available from publisher's site 7aarticle02846naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100005800142245013900200300001800339500002000357520165800377592002802035596005102063650001602114650001302130650001502143650001102158650001302169650001102182650001402193650001502207700005602222773013202278856007702410852000902487655001202496IND60789548720221123011653.0220821e201910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078954872DNAL7 a10.1029/2018JF0049712doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNaito, Kensuke1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8683-084610aCan Bankfull Discharge and Bankfull Channel Characteristics of an Alluvial Meandering River be Cospecified From a Flow Duration Curve?  ap. 2381-2401.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aWe present a simple modeling framework for the codetermination of bankfull discharge and corresponding bankfull channel geometry (width, depth, and longitudinal channel slope) of an alluvial meandering river. We specifically consider a sand‐bed river whose floodplain is capped by a mud‐rich layer. We inquire as to how the wide spectrum of flows to which the river is subjected leads to the establishment of specific values for bankfull discharge and associated bankfull geometry. Here we provide a physically based predictor of bankfull discharge that goes beyond the simple assumption of the 1.5‐year flood discharge. We do this using physics‐based submodels for channel and floodplain processes. We show that bankfull discharge and bankfull geometry are established as a result of (i) floodplain vertical accretion due to overbank deposition, (ii) migration of the inner bank and outer cut bank, (iii) net removal of floodplain sediment and reduction in average floodplain height due to lateral channel shift, and (iv) in‐channel downstream bed material transport. The flow duration curve is employed to quantify the effect of these processes, as well as to account for flow variability. Our model captures the spatiotemporal evolution of bankfull discharge, depth, width, and down‐channel slope toward equilibrium for specified flow duration curve and watershed characteristics. Our new framework can be used for assessing long‐term river response to change in sediment supply or flow duration curve. A model implementation is presented for the case of the Trinity River, TX, USA, to demonstrate the use of the model and its behavior.  aPublisher supplied data  aEAR 1209402cNational Science Foundation (NSF) 3afloodplains 3ageometry 3ageophysics 3amodels 3aresearch 3arivers 3asediments 3awatersheds1 aParker, Gary1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5973-52960 tJournal of geophysical research.g2019 Oct., v. 124, no. 10 p.2381-2401dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:27941x2169-90037nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2018JF0049713Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04019naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002100149245013300170300001600303520216700319592002802486650002802514650002802542650001302570650001102583650002602594650003102620650002402651650001002675650002402685650001502709650002102724650001802745650001302763650001902776650001302795650001502808650002002823650001302843650002902856653002802885653002802913653002102941653002102962653000902983700006202992700005703054700002503111700006103136700002403197700002103221773010603242856008403348852000903432655001203441IND60625884620221120132356.0201230e20190116xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062588462DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jprot.2018.02.0242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSoto, Daniela F.10aGlobal effect of the lack of inorganic polyphosphate in the extremophilic archaeon Sulfolobus solfataricus: A proteomic approach  ap. 143-152.  aInorganic polyphosphates (polyP) are present in all living cells and several important functions have been described for them. They are involved in the response to stress conditions, such as nutrient depletion, oxidative stress and toxic metals amongst others. A recombinant strain of Sulfolobus solfataricus unable to accumulate polyP was designed by the overexpression of its endogenous ppx gene. The overall impact of the lack of polyP on this S. solfataricus polyP (−) strain was analyzed by using quantitative proteomics (isotope-coded protein label, ICPL). Stress-related proteins, such as peroxiredoxins and heat shock proteins, proteins involved in metabolism and several others were produced at higher levels in the ppx expression strain. The polyP deficient strain showed an increased copper sensitivity and an earlier transcriptional up-regulation of copA gene coding for the P-type copper-exporting ATPase. This implies a complementary function of both copper resistance systems. These results strongly suggests that the lack of polyP makes this hyperthermophilic archaeon more sensitive to toxic conditions, such as an exposure to metals or other harmful stimuli, emphasizing the importance of this inorganic phosphate polymers in the adaptations to live in the environmental conditions in which thermoacidophilic archaea thrive.Inorganic polyphosphate (polyP) are ubiquitous molecules with many functions in living organisms. Few studies related to these polymers have been made in archaea. The construction of a polyP deficient recombinant strain of Sulfolobus solfataricus allowed the study of the global changes in the proteome of this thermoacidophilic archaeon in the absence of polyP compared with the wild type strain. The results obtained using quantitative proteomics suggest an important participation of polyP in the oxidative stress response of the cells and as having a possible metabolic role in the cell, as previously described in bacteria. The polyP deficient strain also showed an increased copper sensitivity and an earlier transcriptional up-regulation of copA, implying a complementary role of both copper resistance systems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSulfolobus solfataricus 3aadenosinetriphosphatase 3abacteria 3acopper 3aenvironmental factors 3agene expression regulation 3agene overexpression 3agenes 3aheat shock proteins 3ametabolism 3aoxidative stress 3aperoxiredoxin 3apolymers 3apolyphosphates 3aproteome 3aproteomics 3astress response 3atoxicity 3atranscription (genetics) 0aInorganic polyphosphate 0aSulfolobus solfataricus 0apolyP deficiency 0aOxidative stress 0aICPL1 aRecalde, Alejandra1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1610-81851 aOrell, Alvaro1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9024-08541 aAlbers, Sonja-Verena1 aParadela, Alberto1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6837-70561 aNavarro, Claudio A.1 aJerez, Carlos A.0 tJournal of proteomics.g2019 Jan. 16, v. 191 p.143-152dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12134x1874-39197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jprot.2018.02.0243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01943naa a2200241 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245009400171300001400265520110800279592002801387650002601415650001101441650001901452773012501471856008401596852000901680655001201689IND60612410020221119125934.0180905e201608  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061241002DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cosust.2016.11.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWilder, Margaret10aMetrics: moving beyond the adaptation information gap—introduction to the special issue  ap. 90-95.  aThis introduction to the special issue addresses the need to move beyond the adaptation information gap and the benefits and problems inherent in this move.

The review summarizes the promise and challenges encountered in the development and application of metrics and demonstrates that significant challenges remain in developing and applying metric instruments in real-world contexts, the most vexing being the lack of agreement on what model(s) to use and how to weight factors; the lack of evaluation of the validity and robustness of the instruments; the lack of consistency in analytical and application scales; deficits in engaging public participation in instrument design and use; and enduring tensions between contextualized and systematized knowledge, descriptive and predictive capabilities, and static and fluid data.  aPublisher supplied data 3acitizen participation 3amodels 3awater security0 tCurrent opinion in environmental sustainability.g2016 Aug., v. 21 p.90-95dElsevier B.V.wJournal:2237x1877-34357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cosust.2016.11.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02526naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002100152245014100173300001600314520128700330592002801617650002201645650002601667650001901693650002101712650001701733650001101750650001001761650001901771650000901790650001101799650001501810650001101825650001601836650001001852650001101862700002601873700002201899773008801921856008602009852000902095655001202104IND60089132720221117194951.0141102e201212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008913272DNAL7 a10.1016/j.atmosenv.2012.06.0842doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSilva, Daiane T.10aRelationship between ozone, meteorological conditions, gas exchange and leaf injury in Nicotiana tabacum Bel-W3 in a sub-tropical region  ap. 211-216.  aThe city of São Paulo is located in a subtropical region whose climate exhibits few defined seasons as well as frequent oscillations in temperature and rainfall throughout the year. In addition to interfering with physiological processes, these peculiar climatic dynamics influence the formation of O₃ and its influx into leaves, causing species used as bioindicators in temperate climates to be ineffective here. This study evaluated gas exchange variations in CO₂ and H₂O and leaf injuries induced by O₃ in Nicotiana tabacum Bel-W3 in relation to oscillations in environmental conditions. Plants were exposed to an O₃-polluted environment for fifteen periods of fourteen days each throughout 2008. Gas exchange and O₃ were higher during the summer and winter but were highly variable in all seasons. Severe injuries occurred during the winter and spring, with significant variation in this parameter being observed throughout the year. An analysis of biotic and abiotic variables revealed complex relationships among them, with great importance of meteorological factors in plant responses. We conclude that under unstable climatic conditions, the relationship between O₃ flux and injury is weak, and the qualitative character of biomonitoring is further confirmed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNicotiana tabacum 3aatmospheric chemistry 3acarbon dioxide 3aclimatic factors 3agas exchange 3aleaves 3aozone 3aplant response 3arain 3aspring 3asubtropics 3asummer 3atemperature 3awater 3awinter1 aMeirelles, Sérgio T.1 aMoraes, Regina M.0 tAtmospheric environment.g2012 Dec., v. 60 p.211-216dElsevier Ltdx1352-23107nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.atmosenv.2012.06.0843Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04766naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100007000149245015700219300001600376520307500392592002803467650003903495650001503534650002103549650001803570650001103588650002103599650001203620650000703632650001303639650001303652650001303665650001503678650002603693650005803719650002003777653002703797653003403824653001303858653001303871653001403884700002103898700002403919700001703943700002503960700006403985773010604049856008404155852000904239655001204248IND60625884720221120132401.0201230e20190116xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062588472DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jprot.2018.03.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLewandowska, Aleksandra E.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7750-758510aHuman follicular fluid proteomic and peptidomic composition quantitative studies by SWATH-MS methodology. Applicability of high pH RP-HPLC fractionation  ap. 131-142.  aAnalysis of proteomic composition of human follicular fluid (hFF) has been previously proposed as a potential tool of oocyte quality evaluation. In order to develop an efficient method to investigate the hFF proteome and peptidome components, we applied and tested a few prefractionation schemes of hFF material consisting of ultrafiltration, optional immunodepletion, and high pH RP-HPLC separation by building spectral libraries and comparing their quantification capabilities of unfractionated samples. Low Molecular-Weight Fraction peptides (LMWF, <10 kDa) and High Molecular-Weight Fraction proteins (HMWF, >10 kDa) resulting from ultrafiltration were analyzed separately. We identified 302 proteins in HMWF and 161 proteins in LMWF in all qualitative experiments. All LMWF peptidomic libraries turned out to be of poor quantification quality, however they enabled measurement of higher numbers of peptides with increasing input of experiment data, in contrast to HMWF proteomic libraries. We were able to quantify a total of 108 HMWF proteins and 250 LMWF peptides (from 84 proteins) in all experiments. Employment of high RP-HPLC fractionation allowed for identification of a much broader set of proteins, however did not significantly improve the quantification capabilities of the applied method. Data are available via ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD008073.In the search of biomarkers for assessment of oocyte quality in assisted reproductive technology, many studies are devoted to analysis of follicular fluid composition. Candidates for such biomarkers can be located in both the proteome and the recently investigated peptidome of hFF. Reliable qualitative and especially quantitative analysis of complex mixtures such as hFF, requires development of a fast and preferably inexpensive analytical procedure. The powerful SWATH-MS technique is well suited for quantitative label-free analysis of complex protein and peptide mixtures. However, for efficient usage it needs well designed and constructed MS-spectral libraries as well as a proper protocol for sample preparation. We investigated the influence of the size and quality of MS-spectral libraries (different spectral libraries are constructed using various sample prefractionation protocols) on SWATH experiments on hFF proteome and peptidome. In the case of peptidome investigation, increasing the size of spectral libraries led to quantification of more peptides in a single experiment. For the proteome, increasing the size of spectral libraries improved quantification only to a limited extend, and further extension of spectral libraries even worsened results. Nevertheless, using the best selected prefractionation schemes and spectral libraries we were able to quantify as many as 79 proteins of hFF proteome and 106 peptides (from 53 proteins) of hFF peptidome in single experiments. The spectral libraries and prefractionation protocols we developed allow for a large scale fast scan of hundreds of clinical hFF samples in the search for biomarkers for evaluation of oocyte quality.  aPublisher supplied data 3aassisted reproductive technologies 3abiomarkers 3afollicular fluid 3afractionation 3ahumans 3amolecular weight 3aoocytes 3apH 3apeptides 3aproteins 3aproteome 3aproteomics 3aquantitative analysis 3areversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography 3aultrafiltration 0aHuman follicular fluid 0aHigh pH RP-HPLC fractionation 0aSWATH-MS 0aProteome 0aPeptidome1 aMacur, Katarzyna1 aCzaplewska, Paulina1 aLiss, Joanna1 aŁukaszuk, Krzysztof1 aOłdziej, Stanisław1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4583-39410 tJournal of proteomics.g2019 Jan. 16, v. 191 p.131-142dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12134x1874-39197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jprot.2018.03.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03934naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100003000148245008000178300001400258520207600272592002802348650002002376650002402396650002102420650001902441650001902460650001202479650003302491650001502524650002502539650002202564650002102586650001902607650002802626650001202654650001502666650002202681650001702703651002202720653002002742653001002762653001802772653001702790653002402807653001302831653001802844653001902862653002702881700002202908700002902930700003002959700002002989700002303009700002403032700002203056773013803078856008303216852000903299655001203308IND60707625220221119103029.0201104e202011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070762522DNAL7 a10.1016/j.baae.2020.08.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHerrando-Pérez, Salvador10aWater deprivation drives intraspecific variability in lizard heat tolerance  ap. 37-51.  aQuantifying intraspecific variation in heat tolerance is critical to understand how species respond to climate change. In a previous study, we recorded variability in critical thermal maxima (CTₘₐₓ) by 3 °C among populations of small Iberian lizard species, which could substantially influence predictions of climate-driven activity restriction. Here, we undertake experiments to examine whether we could reproduce similar levels of heat-tolerance variability in response to water deficit. We hypothesized that deprivation of drinking water should increase variability in CTₘₐₓ between populations more than deprivation of food under the theoretical expectation that the variation of the more limiting resource must trigger stronger variation in physiological performance. We measured CTₘₐₓ after manipulating availability of live prey and drinking water in two populations of an arid and a mesic lizard species from the Iberian Peninsula. We quantified a mean CTₘₐₓ across all studied lizards of 44.2 °C ± 0.2 SE for the arid species and 41.7 °C ± 0.3 SE for the mesic species. Using multimodel inference, we found that water deprivation (combined with food supply) caused population differences in CTₘₐₓ by 3 to 4 °C which were two to three times wider than population differences due to food deprivation (combined with water supply) or to food and water provision. To highlight the need for more thermo-hydroregulatory research, we examined bias in research effort towards thermal versus hydric environmental effects on heat tolerance through a systematic literature review. We show that environmental temperature has been used five times more frequently than precipitation in ecological studies of heat tolerance of terrestrial species. Studies linking thermal tolerance of ectotherms to the interplay of air temperature and water availability are needed in the face of projected increases in aridity and drought in the 21st century, because the balance of body temperature and water resources are functionally interlinked.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair temperature 3aambient temperature 3abody temperature 3aclimate change 3adrinking water 3adrought 3adry environmental conditions 3aectothermy 3aenvironmental impact 3afood availability 3afood deprivation 3aheat tolerance 3aintraspecific variation 3alizards 3aprediction 3awater deprivation 3awater supply 3aIberian Peninsula 0aAcanthodactylus 0aCTmax 0aEcophysiology 0aMacroecology 0aPhenotypic variance 0aPodarcis 0aPrecipitation 0aSpecialization 0aThermo-hydroregulation1 aBelliure, Josabel1 aFerri-Yáñez, Francisco1 avan den Burg, Matthijs P.1 aBeukema, Wouter1 aAraújo, Miguel B.1 aTerblanche, John S.1 aVieites, David R.0 tBasic and applied ecology.g2020 Nov., v. 48 p.37-51dElsevier GmbHaGesellschaft für ÖkologiewJournal:jnl3925117x1439-17917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.baae.2020.08.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01753naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002900150245002800179300001400207520086300221592002801084650003301112650001101145650002201156650002301178700002001201700002401221773012501245856008401370852000901454655001201463IND60612410220221119125859.0180905e201710  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061241022DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cosust.2017.08.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHughes, Christine Parkin14aThe sustainability skew  ap. 58-63.  aSustainability is an emerging field, defining organisational success beyond profit. However, in current business and organisations, social sustainability—particularly human sustainability within the workplace, is less prominent than environmental sustainability in terms of research and public and business interest. This is significant, as theoretical exploration and research informs discussion, organisational management and policy debate. In this review, we explore why the physical environment is put centre stage, and seemingly considered to be more important than people. Explanations for the current disparity are attributed to a lack of shared meaning, engagement with reality, visibility and ideology. Addressing these drivers for disparity can also pave the way for a more fundamental paradigm shift when it comes to sustainability for business.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenvironmental sustainability 3ahumans 3aissues and policy 3aworking conditions1 aSemeijn, Judith1 aCaniëls, Marjolein0 tCurrent opinion in environmental sustainability.g2017 Oct., v. 28 p.58-63dElsevier B.V.wJournal:2237x1877-34357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cosust.2017.08.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03531naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100005800144245012700202300001600329506002800345520185000373592002802223506003702251650002202288650002902310650001902339650002702358650001002385650002102395650002302416650001002439650001302449650001102462650001802473650001902491650001102510650001102521651001102532653002902543653001602572653002602588653002002614653004002634653002202674700005702696700006902753773010302822856007902925852000903004655001203013IND60755359320221207143206.0220104e20211030xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075535932DNAL7 a10.1515/opag-2021-00442doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLepcha, Norden1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2889-719010aProductivity and profitability of organic and conventional potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) production in West-Central Bhutan  ap. 640-654.  aResource is Open Access  aBhutan aspires to be an entirely organic nation. Food self-sufficiency and increasing farm household income are critical priorities in the country. Realising these priorities necessitates assessing the country’s current organic agriculture performance. The objectives of this study were to investigate the productivity and profitability of organic and conventional potato and farmers’ constraints in producing organic potato in West-Central Bhutan. Multistage and purposive sampling techniques were used to select the study sample. A semi-structured questionnaire and face-to-face interviews were employed to gather primary data for the 2019 cropping cycle from 93 potato farmers: 43 organic farmers in the Gasa District and 50 conventional farmers in Wangdue Phodrang District. Descriptive statistics, cost and return analysis, and independent sample t-test were applied for data analysis. The results revealed that the conventional potato’s productivity (tuber yield) and profitability were significantly higher (p < 0.001) than organic potatoes. The average productivities for organic and conventional potatoes were 7.48 and 19.22 t/ha, respectively. Organic potato farmers incurred a loss of −202,708.47 Ngultrum (Nu)/ha, while conventional potato farmers incurred a profit of 83,832.85 Nu/ha. The benefit-cost ratios of organic and conventional potato stood at 0.40 and 1.27, respectively. Lack of premium price, pest and disease problems, low crop productivity, and climate change were the constraints faced by organic potato farmers. The study found that the productivity and profitability of the conventional potatoes were higher than the organic potatoes in West-Central Bhutan in the current scenario. Further, the critical information will contribute to guiding Bhutan’s vision for its organic agriculture development.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aSolanum tuberosum 3aagricultural development 3aclimate change 3adescriptive statistics 3afarms 3ahousehold income 3aorganic production 3apests 3apotatoes 3aprices 3aprofitability 3aquestionnaires 3at-test 3avision 3aBhutan 0acost and return analysis 0aconstraints 0afarm household income 0afarm-gate price 0aorganic agriculture’s performance 0apotato production1 aMankeb, Panya1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8650-37571 aSuwanmaneepong, Suneeporn1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5781-98590 tOpen Agriculture.g2021 Oct. 30, v. 6, no. 1 p.640-654dDe GruyterwJournal:23162x2391-95317nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1515/opag-2021-00443Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02574naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001700152245013000169300001600299520144700315592002801762650002601790650001601816650001101832650001001843650001101853650001101864650001601875651001101891700001901902700002601921700001401947700001501961700001401976700001501990773008802005856008602093852000902179655001202188IND60089132820221117194939.0141102e201212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008913282DNAL7 a10.1016/j.atmosenv.2012.06.0172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCurier, R.L.10aImproving ozone forecasts over Europe by synergistic use of the LOTOS-EUROS chemical transport model and in-situ measurements  ap. 217-226.  aIn this paper we investigate the added value of assimilation of ozone in-situ measurements for both re-analysis and forecasting purposes. Various simulations were performed using the LOTOS-EUROS chemical transport model and an Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF) to assimilate measured ozone surface concentrations over Europe, for spring and summer of 2007. The results for the re-analysis of ozone show a significant improvement in the LOTOS-EUROS performance score when compared to measurements. The average correlation coefficient for the daily maximum ozone concentration improves from 0.72 to 0.83. Similarly, the average Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) for the daily maximum ozone concentration is reduced from 20.8 to 16.9 μg m⁻³. The free running model performs well in forecast mode and the agreement between in-situ and modeled ozone concentration is good. The average temporal correlation coefficient ranges from 0.62 for the first day forecast to 0.61 for the third day forecast. Based on these results, assimilated fields were used to initialize the forecast. As for the re-analysis a better comparison between model and observation was observed. The mean correlation coefficient increased by 0.07 and the averaged RMSE decreased by 0.65 μg m⁻³. However, the addition of an inheritance scheme to import additional information from the data assimilation to the forecast did not significantly improve the concentration fields.  aPublisher supplied data 3aatmospheric chemistry 3acorrelation 3amodels 3aozone 3aspring 3asummer 3avalue added 3aEurope1 aTimmermans, R.1 aCalabretta-Jongen, S.1 aEskes, H.1 aSegers, A.1 aSwart, D.1 aSchaap, M.0 tAtmospheric environment.g2012 Dec., v. 60 p.217-226dElsevier Ltdx1352-23107nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.atmosenv.2012.06.0173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02764naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245009100165500001900256520129400275592002801569650001601597650001201613650001501625650001901640650001801659650002301677650001601700650001101716650001901727650002501746650001501771650001701786650003001803650003501833653001901868653003001887653001301917653002501930653002601955700006001981700001902041700001902060773011102079856008302190852000902273655001202282IND60730126220221122142520.0210729e20210515xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073012622DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bios.2021.1131132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDeng, Yanlin14aThe effects of biofilms on tumor progression in a 3D cancer-biofilm microfluidic model  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aComponents within the tumor microenvironment, such as intratumoral bacteria (IB; within tumors), affect tumor progression. However, current experimental models have not explored the effects of extratumoral bacteria (EB; outside tumors) on cancer progression. Here, we developed a microfluidic platform to analyze the influence of bacterial distribution on bladder cancer progression under defined conditions, using uropathogenic Escherichia coli. This was achieved by establishing coating (CT) and colonizing (CL) models to simulate the different invasion and colonization modes of IB and EB in tumor tissues. We demonstrated that both EB and IB induced closer cell-cell contacts within the tumor cluster, but cancer cell viability was reduced only in the presence of IB. Interestingly, cancer stem cell counts increased significantly in the presence of EB. These outcomes were due to the formation of extracellular DNA-based biofilms by EB. Triple therapy of DNase (anti-biofilm agent), ciprofloxacin (antibiotic), and doxorubicin (anti-cancer drug) could effectively eradicate biofilms and tumors simultaneously. Our preclinical proof-of-concept provides insights on how bacteria can influence tumor progression and facilitate future research on anti-biofilm cancer management therapies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantibiotics 3abiofilm 3abiosensors 3acell viability 3aciprofloxacin 3adeoxyribonucleases 3adoxorubicin 3amodels 3aneoplasm cells 3aneoplasm progression 3astem cells 3atherapeutics 3aurinary bladder neoplasms 3auropathogenic Escherichia coli 0aDrug screening 0aMicrofluidic tumor models 0aBiofilms 0aAntibacterial agents 0aCombinatorial therapy1 aLiu, Sylvia Yang1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3552-77801 aChua, Song Lin1 aKhoo, Bee Luan0 tBiosensors & bioelectronics.g2021 May 15, v. 180 p.113113-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11631x0956-56637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bios.2021.1131133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03705naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002000152245014000172300001600312520221200328592002802540650001902568650002402587650002602611650001002637650002502647650002602672650001402698650003202712650001902744650002002763650002002783650001802803650000902821650001302830650001102843650001702854650002002871650002702891650001502918650001902933651001102952700001702963700002102980700001503001773008803016856008603104852000903190655001203199IND60089132920221117195002.0141102e201212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008913292DNAL7 a10.1016/j.atmosenv.2012.06.0622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBengtsson, S.B.10aInfluence of development stage of spring oilseed rape and spring wheat on interception of wet-deposited radiocaesium and radiostrontium  ap. 227-233.  aThe dry and wet deposition of radionuclides released into the atmosphere can be intercepted by vegetation in terrestrial ecosystems. The aim of this study was to quantify the interception of wet deposited ¹³⁴Cs and ⁸⁵Sr by spring oilseed rape (Brassíca napus L.) and spring wheat (Tríticum aestívum L.). The dependency of the intercepted fraction (f) on total above ground plant biomass, growing stage and the Leaf Area Index (LAI) was quantified. A trial was established in Uppsala (east central Sweden), with land management in accordance to common agricultural practices. The field trial was a randomised block design of 1 × 1 m² parcels with three replicates. During the growing season of 2010, a rainfall simulator deposited ¹³⁴Cs and ⁸⁵Sr during six different growth stages. Two to 3 h after deposition, the biomass of the centre 25 × 25 cm² area of each parcel was sampled and above ground biomass and LAI were measured. The radioactivity concentration and radioactivity of samples were measured by High Purity Germanium (HPGe)-detectors. For ¹³⁴Cs, there was a correlation between f and LAI (r² = 0.55, p < 0.05) for spring wheat, but not for spring oilseed rape (r² = 0.28, p > 0.05). For ⁸⁵Sr, there was a correlation between f and LAI for both crops (r² = 0.41, p < 0.05 for spring oilseed rape and r² = 0.48 p, <0.05 for spring wheat). There was no correlation between f and above ground plant biomass in spring oilseed rape for either ¹³⁴Cs (r² = 0.01, p > 0.05) or for ⁸⁵Sr (r² = 0.11, p > 0.05). For spring wheat, there was a correlation for both ¹³⁴Cs (r² = 0.36, p < 0.05) and ⁸⁵Sr (r² = 0.32, p < 0.05). For spring oilseed rape, f was highest at growth stage ‘stem elongation’ for ¹³⁴Cs (0.32 ± 0.22) and ⁸⁵Sr (0.41 ± 0.29). For spring wheat, f was highest at growth stage ‘ripening’ for both radionuclides (¹³⁴Cs was 0.36 ± 0.14 and ⁸⁵Sr was 0.48 ± 0.18). Thus, LAI can be used to quantify interception of both radionuclides for both crops, whereas, above ground plant biomass is a weak measure of interception of wet deposited radiocaesium and radiostrontium.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBrassica napus 3aaboveground biomass 3aatmospheric chemistry 3acrops 3adevelopmental stages 3afield experimentation 3agermanium 3agood agricultural practices 3agrowing season 3aland management 3aleaf area index 3aradionuclides 3arain 3aripening 3aspring 3aspring wheat 3astem elongation 3aterrestrial ecosystems 3avegetation 3awet deposition 3aSweden1 aEriksson, J.1 aGärdenäs, A.I.1 aRosén, K.0 tAtmospheric environment.g2012 Dec., v. 60 p.227-233dElsevier Ltdx1352-23107nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.atmosenv.2012.06.0623Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03580naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002000144245018300164300001600347520197800363592002802341650001402369650001602383650001902399650001602418650001902434650001602453650001202469650002202481650001402503650001602517650001302533650002302546650001102569650002002580653002002600653002002620653001602640653002502656700001902681700001902700700002602719700001802745700002102763700002502784700002002809700002502829773010802854856007902962852000903041655001203050IND60777001220221120165807.0220512e20220401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077700122DNAL7 a10.2478/aoas-2021-00742doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAhmadi, Bahareh10aCorrelations between first order echotextural characteristics and chemical composition of pectoralis major muscles in broiler chickens receiving different dietary fat supplements  ap. 803-813.  aThis study examined the quantitative relationships among ultrasonographic image attributes and chemical composition of the pectoralis major muscles in broiler chickens that received four different dietary fat supplements (Group SO: soybean oil; Group FO: flaxseed oil; Group SO+FO: soybean oil+flaxseed oil; and Group BT: beef tallow; n=10 birds/group). Ultrasonograms of birds’ pectoral muscles, in a transverse (T) and longitudinal (L) plane, were obtained just before slaughter at 6 weeks of age and were subjected to digital image analyses to determine mean pixel intensity (MPI) and pixel heterogeneity values (standard deviation of numerical pixel values; MPH; a.k.a first order echotextural characteristics). Thirty-eight chemical characteristics of the muscles were determined post-mortem (crude fat, protein, and dry matter as well as fatty acid profiles) and were analyzed for correlations with the echotextural variables. A total of 12 (L-MPI: 7; L-MPH: 4; and T-MPH: 1 correlation), 5 (L-MPI: 2; L-MPH: 2; and T-MPI: 1 correlation), 15 (L-MPI: 10; T-MPI: 4; and T-MPH: 1 correlation) and 8 (L-MPI: 2; L-MPH: 1; and T-MPH: 5 correlations) significant correlations were recorded in Groups SO, FO, SO+FO and BT, respectively. When the data were pooled for all 40 birds studied, significant correlations with echotextural attributes were recorded for eighteen different chemical constituents, with the strongest overall correlation found between crude fat content and T-MPI (r=0.52, P=0.0005). In conclusion, there exists a potential application for ultrasonographic imaging in situ combined with computerized image analysis to estimate certain chemical constituents of pectoralis major muscles in broiler chickens. However, the existence and strength of correlations among ultrasonographic image attributes and muscle composition are affected by the source of dietary fat and relative abundance (“threshold concentrations”) of individual chemical components.  aPublisher supplied data 3acrude fat 3adietary fat 3adigital images 3afatty acids 3aimage analysis 3alinseed oil 3amuscles 3apectoralis muscle 3aslaughter 3asoybean oil 3asoybeans 3astandard deviation 3atallow 3aultrasonography 0abroiler chicken 0apectoral muscle 0aechotexture 0achemical composition1 aJamieson, Mark1 aAhmadi, Behnaz1 aPołtowicz, Katarzyna1 aNowak, Joanna1 aMurawski, Maciej1 aMałopolska, Martyna1 aSchwarz, Tomasz1 aBartlewski, Pawel M.0 tAnnals of animal science.g2022 Apr. 01, v. 22, no. 2 p.803-813dSciendowJournal:2194x2300-87337nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2478/aoas-2021-00743Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04164naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002900150245010200179300001400281520246400295592002802759650001702787650001202804650001402816650002302830650001302853650001502866650001702881650001602898650001802914650001702932650001702949650001502966650001902981650001403000650001103014650001003025650001503035650001403050651001503064651002803079653002503107653002203132653001103154653001703165653002803182653001903210653001803229653001803247653002103265700002103286700002003307773012903327856008503456961001203541852000903553655001203562IND60526221420221120203343.0190403e20160301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052622142DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foreco.2015.12.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAirey Lauvaux, Catherine10aHigh severity fire and mixed conifer forest-chaparral dynamics in the southern Cascade Range, USA  ap. 74-85.  aUnderstanding how alternative vegetation types co-exist in a landscape is important in managing for biodiversity within an ecosystem. In California, mixed conifer forest is often interrupted by stands of shrubs known as montane chaparral. The development of chaparral stands following recent high severity or stand-replacing wildfires in mixed conifer forests has been well documented. Fire has been excluded from mixed conifer forests for over a century, and fuel loads are at historically high levels across much of this landscape. Despite contemporary post-fire research on mixed conifer forest, little is known about montane chaparral fire regimes or forest-chaparral dynamics in an ecosystem with a functioning fire regime. This study quantifies fire regimes in chaparral and adjacent forest and determines how chaparral responded to fire before fire exclusion in Lassen Volcanic National Park, California, a park that was never logged. Chaparral stems regenerated immediately after high severity fires in the 19th and early 20th century, and stem recruitment continued until the present. Fire return intervals in chaparral were longer than in adjacent forest (25years vs. 11years), and chaparral fires occurred during drier, potentially more extreme conditions. The apparent maintenance of stands of chaparral by less frequent, more severe fires suggests chaparral represents a self-reinforcing alternative stable state to forest. Following fire exclusion, chaparral stands gradually converted to forest as trees progressively invaded chaparral from the forest edge. Forest developing in chaparral is denser and more fir-enriched than the adjacent forest, similar to the understory that develops beneath a pine overstory following fire exclusion. Replacement of chaparral by forest reduces mixed conifer forest landscape diversity. However, the mixture of shrubs and trees in long unburned former chaparral is likely to burn with high severity effects in a subsequent fire. Since chaparral is also establishing in recent, very large high severity burn patches, chaparral extent may be expanding in the new configuration. If the decades needed for trees to invade from forest at the edge of severe burns exceed the fire return interval, chaparral may emerge as an alternative stable state to forest. Consequently, developing management strategies to increase resilience of mixed conifer forests to altered fire regimes is a pressing management challenge.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiodiversity 3aburning 3achaparral 3aconiferous forests 3aconifers 3aecosystems 3aedge effects 3afire regime 3afire severity 3aforest trees 3afuel loading 3alandscapes 3anational parks 3aoverstory 3ashrubs 3astems 3aunderstory 3awildfires 3aCalifornia 3aCascade Mountain region 0aMixed conifer forest 0aMontane chaparral 0aShrubs 0aFire effects 0aAlternate stable states 0aFire exclusion 0aHeterogeneity 0aCascade Range 0aVegetation shift1 aSkinner, Carl N.1 aTaylor, Alan H.0 tForest ecology and management.g2016 Mar. 01, v. 363 p.74-85dElsevier B.V.aElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl9013x0378-11277nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2015.12.0163Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/FS  aDNAL 7aarticle03058naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100005600142245011100198300001800309520161100327592002801938650004401966650002202010650001402032650003602046650001602082650001402098650001502112650002202127650003302149700001902182700001602201700001902217700001902236700001602255700002002271700005902291700005502350773014602405856007602551852000902627655001202636IND60603910920221120150443.0180716e20180507xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060391092DNAL7 a10.1021/jacs.8b033092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Guofeng1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1911-854610aControlling Supramolecular Chirality of Two-Component Hydrogels by J- and H-Aggregation of Building Blocks  ap. 6467-6473.  aWhile manipulating the helicity of nanostructures is a challenging task, it attracts great research interest on account of its crucial role in better understanding the formation mechanisms of helical systems. For the supramolecular chirality in self-assembly systems, one challenge is how to understand the origin of supramolecular chirality and inherent helicity information on nanostructures regulated by functionality-oriented stacking modes (such as J- and H-aggregation) of building blocks. Herein, two-component hydrogels were prepared by phenylalanine-based enantiomers and achiral bis(pyridinyl) derivatives, where helical nanofibers with inverse handedness as well as controllable helical pitch and diameter were readily obtained through stoichiometric coassembly of these building blocks. The helix inversion was achieved by the transition between the J- and H-aggregation of bis(pyridinyl) derivatives, which was collectively confirmed by circular dichroism, scanning electron microscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and single X-ray crystallography. Interestingly, the helical coassemblies with opposite handedness could be obtained not only from the enantiomeric building blocks but also from the chiral monomers with the same configurational chirality by exchanging achiral additives. This work provides insight into the origin and helicity inversion of supramolecular chirality in molecular self-assembly systems and may shine light on the precise fabrication of chiral nanostructures for potential applications in smart display devices, optoelectronics, and biological systems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3aadditives 3acircular dichroism spectroscopy 3aenantiomers 3ahydrogels 3ananofibers 3aoptical isomerism 3ascanning electron microscopy1 aSheng, Jianhui1 aWu, Hongwei1 aYang, Chaolong1 aYang, Guangbao1 aLi, Yongxin1 aGanguly, Rakesh1 aZhu, Liangliang1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6268-33511 aZhao, Yanli1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9231-83600 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2018 May 07, v. 140, no. 20 p.6467-6473dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19166x1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jacs.8b033093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02845naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005700150245014700207300001600354520127200370592002801642650001301670650001401683650001201697650001601709650003101725650001801756650001101774650001501785650001001800650002501810650001401835653001501849653001701864653001501881653001101896653001801907653001201925653001601937700001401953700002101967700005201988700002602040700006202066700001902128773009802147856008502245852000902330655001202339IND60787501220221120172512.0220914e202209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078750122DNAL7 a10.1016/j.renene.2022.08.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJacob, Ashwin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7327-324010aFormulation of optimal bioenergy mixtures from phototrophic and heterotrophic cultures of S. quadricauda and C. pyrenoidosa microalgal strains  ap. 695-708.  aThe goal of this research is to produce bio-alcohol and biodiesel from S. quadricauda and C. pyrenoidosa microalgae in a sustainable manner using phototrophic and heterotrophic pathways. Experimental and statistical approaches are used to assess the viability of the bioenergy produced as a prospective alternative to diesel fuel. On analysis, it was observed that the %age weight of the dry cell of C. pyrenoidosa cultures on scaling-up resulted lipid content of 44.1%, 46.7%, and 41%, respectively. On scaling up, the cultures’ biomass concentrations reached 5.15 g L ⁻¹, 4.24 g L ⁻¹, and 4.36 g L ⁻¹. Similarly, upscaling S. quadricauda cultures resulted in yield rates of 4.2 g L ⁻¹ and 2.96 g L ⁻¹ d ⁻¹ and a lipid productivity of 2.96 g L ⁻¹ d ⁻¹, respectively. On engine testing, AA20D80 and AA30D70 blend combinations shows an improvement of 4.84% and 6.9% in BTE with a reduction of 88.6% and 72.41% in fuel consumption. Similarly, as compared to amyl alcohol blends and diesel fuel at full load, CP20D80 and CP30D70 efficiently lower HC, NOx, and smoke emissions. The statistical analysis revealed that the similarity index of the 20% and 30% proportions were ideal in achieving optimal engine output characteristics.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalcohols 3abiodiesel 3abiomass 3adiesel fuel 3aenergy use and consumption 3alipid content 3alipids 3amicroalgae 3asmoke 3astatistical analysis 3aviability 0aProduction 0aPhototrophic 0aMicroalgae 0aEngine 0aHeterotrophic 0aBiomass 0aSustainable1 aAshok, B.1 aShanthakumar, S.1 aJino, L.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2242-26131 aKārttikēyan̲, Ā.,1 aKavvampally, Rahul1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9411-58261 aRaja, Ignatius0 tRenewable energy.g2022 Sept., v. 197 p.695-708dElsevier LtdwJournal:11970x0960-14817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.renene.2022.08.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03802naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002700150245019000177300001400367520201000381592002802391650001602419650002502435650002502460650002702485650001002512650003002522650002602552650001002578650001902588650001902607650001802626650002302644650002302667650002202690653001102712653002302723653001902746653001602765653001802781653000802799653000802807653000802815653001102823653000802834653000802842653001002850653000802860700003102868700002602899700002302925700006902948773010103017856008503118852000903203655001203212IND60787410720221119131105.0220921e202210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078741072DNAL7 a10.1016/j.nutres.2022.07.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLinden-Torres, Enrique10aCoffee consumption has no effect on circulating markers of liver function but increases adiponectin concentrations: A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials  ap. 24-34.  aNonalcoholic fatty liver disease has become the most common liver disorder worldwide, reaching a prevalence of 60% and 24% in patients with chronic liver disease and the general population, respectively. Liver function is often assessed using standard liver tests such as alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, gamma-glutamyl transferase, and alkaline phosphatase. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) investigating the potential beneficial effects of coffee consumption on liver function are scarce and their results are inconclusive. Some clinical trials have shown a significant increase in adiponectin concentrations following coffee consumption; however, there are few studies in this field. Hence, the hypothesis of this meta-analysis of RCTs is that coffee consumption decreases blood markers of liver function and increases adiponectin concentrations. A systematic search was conducted in PubMed-MEDLINE, Scopus, Web of Science, ClinicalTrials.gov, and Google Scholar databases. Meta-analysis was performed using a random-effects model followed by sensitivity analysis. Meta-analysis of 14 RCTs, including a total of 897 subjects, showed that coffee consumption has no significant effect on alanine aminotransferase (weighted mean difference [WMD], –0.89 mg/mL; 95% CI, –2.90 to 1.12; P = .39), aspartate aminotransferase (WMD, –0.29 mg/mL; 95% CI, –1.25 to 0.66; P = .55), gamma-glutamyl transferase (WMD, .10 mg/mL; 95% CI, –3.94 to 4.15; P = .96), alkaline phosphatase (WMD, –4.60 mg/mL; 95% CI, –9.26 to 0.07; P = .05), and lactate dehydrogenase (WMD, –0.65 mg/mL; 95% CI, –10.80 to 9.49; P = .90). However, coffee administration significantly increased adiponectin concentrations (WMD, 1.19 mg/mL; 95% CI, 0.08-2.31; P = .04). The results of this meta-analysis of RCTs suggest that coffee consumption may improve liver dysfunction through the elevation of adiponectin levels; however, further clinical trials are needed to corroborate our findings.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadiponectin 3aalanine transaminase 3aalkaline phosphatase 3aaspartate transaminase 3ablood 3agamma-glutamyltransferase 3alactate dehydrogenase 3aliver 3aliver diseases 3aliver function 3ameta-analysis 3anutrition research 3astatistical models 3asystematic review 0aCoffee 0aHepatic parameters 0aLiver function 0aAdiponectin 0aMeta-analysis 0aALP 0aALT 0aAST 0aCYP1A2 0aLDH 0aGGT 0aNAFLD 0aWMD1 aZambrano-Galván, Graciela1 aSahebkar, Amirhossein1 aRíos-Mier, Mayela1 aSimental-Mendía, Luis E.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3617-49210 tNutrition research.g2022 Oct., v. 106 p.24-34dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl32600x0271-53177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.nutres.2022.07.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02806naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002000140245010000160500001400260520154500274592002801819650002501847650002801872650001001900650002201910650004101932650004001973650001602013650001402029650002202043650003102065650000902096650002102105700002302126700002302149700003002172773012202202856007502324852000902399655001202408IND60703451220221121122211.0200721e20200226xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070345122DNAL7 a10.3390/nu120306012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFarràs, Marta 10aEffects of Virgin Olive Oil and Phenol-Enriched Virgin Olive Oils on Lipoprotein Atherogenicity  aNAL-light  aThe atherogenicity of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and triglyceride-rich lipoproteins (TRLs) may be more significant than LDL cholesterol levels. Clinical trials which have led to increased high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol have not always seen reductions in cardiovascular disease (CVD). Furthermore, genetic variants predisposing individuals to high HDL cholesterol are not associated with a lower risk of suffering a coronary event, and therefore HDL functionality is considered to be the most relevant aspect. Virgin olive oil (VOO) is thought to play a protective role against CVD. This review describes the effects of VOO and phenol-enriched VOOs on lipoprotein atherogenicity and HDL atheroprotective properties. The studies have demonstrated a decrease in LDL atherogenicity and an increase in the HDL-mediated macrophage cholesterol efflux capacity, HDL antioxidant activity, and HDL anti-inflammatory characteristics after various VOO interventions. Moreover, the expression of cholesterol efflux-related genes was enhanced after exposure to phenol-enriched VOOs in both post-prandial and sustained trials. Improvements in HDL antioxidant properties were also observed after VOO and phenol-enriched VOO interventions. Furthermore, some studies have demonstrated improved characteristics of TRL atherogenicity under postprandial conditions after VOO intake. Large-scale, long-term randomized clinical trials, and Mendelian analyses which assess the lipoprotein state and properties, are required to confirm these results.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantioxidant activity 3acardiovascular diseases 3agenes 3agenetic variation 3ahigh density lipoprotein cholesterol 3alow density lipoprotein cholesterol 3amacrophages 3anutrients 3aprotective effect 3arandomized clinical trials 3arisk 3avirgin olive oil1 aCanyelles, Marina 1 aFitó, Montserrat 1 aEscolà-Gil, Joan  Carles0 tNutrients.g2020 Feb. 26, v. 12, no. 3dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2271x2072-66437nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu120306013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02404naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245011700168300001600285520121300301592002801514650001101542650001701553650001401570650001501584650002901599650001601628650002501644650001201669653002301681653002001704653002101724653002201745653001601767700001501783700001601798773009801814856008501912852000901997655001202006IND60787501320221120172439.0220914e202209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078750132DNAL7 a10.1016/j.renene.2022.08.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBasalike, Pie10aNumerical study on the performance of photovoltaic thermal unit condenser with water/nanofluids as fluids medium  ap. 606-616.  aTo fully exploit the use of water/nanofluids in the photovoltaic thermal (PVT) unit condenser and further increase renewable energy resources in energy mix, the current paper numerically studies the effect of operating water/PVT unit, Al₃O₂-water/PVT unit and Ag-water/PVT unit on the overall performance. In the ANSYS Fluent 18, the mathematical equations related to these models were discretized by the second order upwind scheme and solved at steady state, considering the fluid inside pipe as laminar flow. The results were obtained and discussed in terms of coefficient of performance (COP), Nusselt number (Nu), specific exergy (Eᵢₙ,ₒᵤₜ) and outlet flow temperature (Tₒᵤₜ), at different nanoparticle fractions and operating conditions of both flow and weather. A higher inlet mass flow rate of nanofluids (Ag-water and Al₃O₂-water) was recommended both for better COP and handling nanoparticles deposition problem. In addition, due to thermal conductivity difference, the maximum COP of about 3 was achieved from PVT unit condenser with Ag-water as fluid medium. The optimum conditions of flow and weather were proposed for the operation of three considered PVT units condenser.  aPublisher supplied data 3aexergy 3alaminar flow 3amass flow 3ananofluids 3arenewable energy sources 3atemperature 3athermal conductivity 3aweather 0aPVT unit Condenser 0aNumerical study 0aWater/nanofluids 0aNight cold of sky 0aPerformance1 aPeng, Wang1 aZhang, Jili0 tRenewable energy.g2022 Sept., v. 197 p.606-616dElsevier LtdwJournal:11970x0960-14817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.renene.2022.08.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03578naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245009200171300001600263520196600279592002802245650002502273650002602298650002002324650001102344650001302355650002002368653000802388653000802396653000802404653000802412653000902420653000802429653000802437653000802445653000802453653000802461653000802469653000702477653000802484653002302492653002802515653002502543653002502568653002602593700001502619700001302634700001402647700001602661700001402677700002302691700001402714700001402728700001602742773011202758856008502870852000902955655001202964IND60582464220221120081431.0180830e20171201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058246422DNAL7 a10.1016/j.memsci.2017.08.0542doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWagholikar, V.V.10aModeling cell pair resistance and spacer shadow factors in electro-separation processes  ap. 151-162.  aThe electrical resistance of the stack is one of the most important parameters that affects the performance of reverse electrodialysis (RED¹) and other electro-separation processes. The stack is made up of many cell pairs, each cell pair consisting of alternating anion and cation exchange membranes separated by spacer-filled channels which allow fluid to flow across the membrane surfaces, provide mechanical support and maintain intermembrane distance. The presence of non-conducting mesh in the spacer-filled channels increases the electrical resistance of the cell pairs; this so-called shadow effect can be characterized by the shadow factor (β) of the mesh. The shadow factor has not been determined experimentally so far. Furthermore, the extent of the shadow effect on the flow channels and membranes has not been investigated in much detail and the proposed analytical models in the literature are based only on assumptions. In this paper, we used a non-contact resistance (NCR²) method to measure the resistances of mesh filled spacer channels, membranes and sandwiched unit cells separately in high (1M) and low (0.1M) salinity NaCl solutions. The shadow factors of four different spacer mesh samples were determined experimentally. The existing methods of modeling the cell pair resistance were evaluated and the most suitable functional form for the resistances in series (RIS³) model was determined. While the mesh shadow factors were found to be independent of solution concentration, the membrane resistances were found to decrease with an increase in solution concentration. The mesh shadow factor was found to have little influence on the active area of the membranes. The NCR method could expedite the process of down selecting appropriate low resistance spacer meshes and membranes for the RED process. The validated RIS model can be used in techno-economic models for designing electro-separation processes for commercial scale plants.  aPublisher supplied data 3aartificial membranes 3aelectrical resistance 3aelectrodialysis 3amodels 3asalinity 3asodium chloride 0aRED 0aNCR 0aRIS 0aSGP 0aSWRO 0aEWI 0aCEM 0aAEM 0aEMF 0aOCV 0aMPD 0aED 0aEDI 0aElectro-separation 0aReverse electrodialysis 0aCell pair resistance 0aSpacer shadow effect 0aMesh characterization1 aZhuang, H.1 aJiao, Y.1 aMoe, N.E.1 aRamanan, H.1 aGoh, L.M.1 aBarber, Yehonatan,1 aLee, K.S.1 aLee, H.P.1 aFuh, J.Y.H.0 tJournal of membrane science.g2017 Dec. 01, v. 543 p.151-162dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12468x0376-73887nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.memsci.2017.08.0543Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03518naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100003500150245013100185300001600316500001900332520201300351592002802364650002002392650001502412650002202427650002102449650001602470650001302486650001902499650001902518650001702537650001202554650002802566653004102594653003802635653000902673653002502682700002602707700001902733700002802752700002902780700003402809773011102843856008502954852000903039655001203048IND60707625620221119103032.0210114e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070762562DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envsci.2020.07.0292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAllen, Camq(Cameron),d-1973,10aDelivering an enabling environment and multiple benefits for land degradation neutrality: Stakeholder perceptions and progress  ap. 109-118.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aAchieving land degradation neutrality (LDN) was adopted by countries in 2015 as one of the targets of the global Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). As LDN is a relatively new concept there is an increasing need for evidence on the potential socio-economic and environmental benefits of LDN as well as how an enabling environment for implementing LDN measures can be developed. This paper summarises the results from a global survey of LDN stakeholders, and a review of national progress in target setting that was commissioned by the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD) in 2018. The study presents the perceptions of relevant stakeholders on the key components of an enabling environment for achieving and maintaining LDN (institutional, financial, policy/regulatory, and science-policy) as well as expectations of multiple benefits from its implementation. We also highlight key challenges and gaps in progress to date that are emerging from ongoing national target setting programs to implement LDN. The study finds that progress in implementing LDN has been widespread across countries. However there remains a lack of awareness of LDN and its key concepts along with high-level political buy-in. This may be impeding the integration of LDN into national development planning and budgeting processes where progress was assessed as limited. National capacities for securing land tenure and governance arrangements and integrated land use planning were perceived as comparatively low, further hampering the implementation of LDN. Despite these gaps, most stakeholders (>90 %) who participated in the global survey expected LDN to deliver a broad range of multiple benefits for human wellbeing, livelihoods and the natural environment. We argue that greater efforts are needed to raise awareness of LDN, educate core stakeholders in its concepts, enablers and benefits, raise its political profile, and provide evidence on national measures that will support implementation of LDN.  aPublisher supplied data 3adesertification 3agovernance 3aissues and policy 3aland degradation 3aland tenure 3apolitics 3asocial welfare 3asocioeconomics 3astakeholders 3asurveys 3asustainable development 0aSustainable development goals (SDGs) 0aLand degradation neutrality (LDN) 0aLand 0aEnabling environment1 aMetternicht, Graciela1 aVerburg, Peter1 aAkhtar-Schuster, Mariam1 aInacio da Cunha, Marcelo1 aSanchez Santivañez, Marioldy0 tEnvironmental science & policy.g2020 Dec., v. 114 p.109-118dElsevier LtdwJournal:12413x1462-90117nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envsci.2020.07.0293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02510naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005800148245012200206300001600328520113800344592002801482596008501510650002001595650001801615650002101633650001501654650001801669650003301687650001301720650001401733650000901747650002001756650001401776650001301790700002501803700001801828700001801846773014401864856008302008852000902091655001202100IND60755359720221120075459.0211030e202111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075535972DNAL7 a10.1007/s00128-021-03316-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYipel, Mustafa1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6390-931310aDistribution and Ecotoxicological Risk Assessment of Heavy Metals in Streams of Amanos Mountains from Southern Turkey  ap. 895-903.  aAssessing the potential ecological risks of chemical pollutants like heavy metals is a key tool of a sustainable environment. With this goal, ecotoxicological significant metal (Al, As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Fe, Hg, Ni, Pb, and Zn) levels of the water (n = 32) and sediment (n = 32) samples of streams [rural (8 points) and urban (8 points) sides] on Amanos Mountains were determined by inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES) and ecotoxicological risk assessment was performed through the potential ecological risk index (RI). The study region with intense urban activities has also ecological importance with regards to wildlife. It is located on the migration route of birds, hosts loggerhead and green sea turtles, Mediterranean seals, and some terrestrial species like mountain gazelle and striped hyena. All calculated RI values were below the potential risk limits and the ecotoxicological risk was observed to be very low. Metal levels should be monitored periodically, and necessary measures should be taken before the reflection of the increase to be determined by the risk assessment on the ecosystem.  aPublisher supplied data  a11963cHatay Mustafa Kemal University, Scientific Research Projects Coordination 3aCaretta caretta 3aHyaena hyaena 3aTurkey (country) 3aecosystems 3aecotoxicology 3aenvironmental sustainability 3agazelles 3apollution 3arisk 3arisk assessment 3asediments 3awildlife1 aTekeli, Ibrahim Ozan1 aDikmen, Bilal1 aYarsan, Ender0 tBulletin of environmental contamination and toxicology.g2021 Nov., v. 107, no. 5 p.895-903dSpringer USwJournal:jnl46145x0007-48617nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00128-021-03316-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02559naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005500150245010400205300001800309520130800327592002801635650002301663650001401686650001401700650001101714650002901725650002001754650001001774650001601784650003701800653001901837653001601856700001901872700001701891700001901908700001501927700001401942773009901956856008502055852000902140655001202149IND60761817720221119115721.0220207e202202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076181772DNAL7 a10.1016/j.renene.2021.12.1412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDu, Jinlong1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8684-134X10aPyrolysis of rubber seed oil over high-temperature copper slag: Gas and mechanism of coke formation  ap. 1209-1220.  aIn the process of direct use and upgrading of rubber seed oil (RSO), coke formation is a severe problem. Therefore, evolution of the cokes structure is a key factor affecting the efficient utilization of RSO. This study investigates the production of coke during RSO pyrolysis. All cokes are analyzed and characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy, CHNS/O analysis, and Raman. The results indicate that cokes on the surface of copper slag (SCS-cokes) are coral-like and the surfaces are relatively rough while cokes on the quartz tube wall (QTW-cokes) have a flat structure. According to FT-IR (500–4000 cm⁻¹), QTW-cokes and SCS-cokes contain a variety of O-containing functional groups. Raman spectra indicate a decrease in the total band area with increasing temperature due to the loss of O-containing functional groups at high temperature. The small aromatic ring systems in cokes are transformed into the large aromatic ring systems. In addition, the yields of pyrolysis gas and cokes increase with increasing temperature, while the opposite is true for tar. RSO pyrolysis products also have value for further processing. Therefore, there is great potential for the co-treatment of CS with RSO.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaromatic compounds 3aevolution 3apyrolysis 3aquartz 3arenewable energy sources 3arubber seed oil 3aslags 3atemperature 3atransmission electron microscopy 0aCoke formation 0aCopper slag1 aZhang, Fengxia1 aHu, Jianhang1 aYang, Shiliang1 aLiu, Huili1 aWang, Hua0 tRenewable energy.g2022 Feb., v. 185 p.1209-1220dElsevier LtdwJournal:11970x0960-14817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.renene.2021.12.1413Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04235naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245010600166300001600272520247900288592002802767650002202795650001702817650002002834650001302854650002502867650001902892650002102911650002002932650001202952650001002964650001102974650003102985650002703016650001103043650001503054650003303069650002603102650001403128650001103142650001303153651001103166653003303177653000903210653002003219653001903239653002103258653001303279653001103292653002203303653001303325700001903338700002103357700001803378700001703396773010503413856008203518852000903600655001203609IND60622205720221118045056.0181124e200002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062220572DNAL7 a10.1191/0959683006705542742doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRosen, Peter,10aNear-infrared spectrometry (NIRS): a new tool for inferring past climatic changes from lake sediments  ap. 161-166.  aThis study tests the hypothesis that lake sediments containclimate–related information that can be detected by near–infrared spectrometry (NIRS), and that NIRS can be used to infer past climatic changes from analysis of sediment cores. NIRS is a rapid and non–destructive technique that measures attributes of the chemical composition of organic materials. A training set of 76 lakes from northern Sweden, spanning a broad altitudinal gradient, was used to assess whether lake altitude and vegetation zones can be modelled from NIR spectra of surface sediments (0–1 cm) using partial least squares (PLS) regression and soft independent modelling of class analogies (SIMCA) classification. Lake altitude served as a surrogate variable reflecting differences in climatic conditions among sites. After spectral filtering using orthogonal signal correction (OSC), cross-validated predictions explained 86% of the variance in altitude and the prediction error (root mean square error) was 78 m, corresponding to 8.3%o of the gradient (390–1250 m above sea level). To evaluate the significance of NIR spectral differences between surface sediments of lakes in different vegetation zones (mountain–birch forest, dwarf shrub and alpine heath), principal component analysis (PCA) models were developed separately for lakes in each vegetation zone. Multivariate classification analysis demonstrated that NIR spectra of surficial sediments differed between lakes located in different vegetation zones. A separate sediment data set from 56 lakes was used to assess sediment ageing effects on NIR signals. Marked similarities between NIR spectra in surface sediments (0–1 cm) and sediments from 1–2 cm depth indicated that degradation of organic material following sediment consolidation resulted in little loss or change of climate–related information. Finally, to assess the ability of NIRS methods to reconstruct past climatic changes over Holocene timescales, we applied the NIRS–altitude model to sediments in a core from a small mountain lake. Estimates of mean July air temperature based on the NIRS–altitude transfer function showed similar trends compared with inferences from chironomids, diatoms and pollen from the same core. Overall, the results indicate that changes in NIR spectra from lake sediments reflect differences in climate, and that NIRS models based on surface–sediment samples can be applied to sediment cores for retrospective analysis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillariophyceae 3aChironomidae 3aair temperature 3aaltitude 3achemical composition 3aclimate change 3aclimatic factors 3adata collection 3aforests 3alakes 3amodels 3anear-infrared spectroscopy 3anondestructive methods 3apollen 3aprediction 3aprincipal component analysis 3aretrospective studies 3asediments 3ashrubs 3avariance 3aSweden 0aNear–infrared spectrometry 0aNIRS 0aclimatic change 0alake sediments 0ajuly temperature 0anorthern 0aSweden 0atransfer function 0aHolocene1 aDåbakk, Eigil1 aRenberg, Ingemar1 aNilsson, Mats1 aHall, Roland0 tHolocene.g2000 Feb., v. 10, no. 2 p.161-166dSage PublicationswJournal:J000001502x0959-68367nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1191/0959683006705542743Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02668naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001800144245010400162300001400266520136100280592002801641650001601669650001701685650002401702650001901726650001201745650002901757650001801786650001101804650001701815650001301832650002301845650000901868650001101877650001301888650001601901700001801917700001701935700002001952700002901972773013302001856007902134852000902213655001202222IND60765037720221119024507.0220419e20110120xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076503772DNAL7 a10.17221/336/2009-cjas2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCzauderna, M.10a&nbsp;A new internal standard for HPLC assay of conjugated linoleic acid in animal tissues and milk  ap. 23-29.  aA new method for the quantification of underivatized conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) isomers and CLA-metabolites by silver ion liquid chromatography (Ag<sup>+</sup>-HPLC) with photodiode array detection (DAD) is described. Conjugated fatty acids (CFA) and sorbic acid as the internal standard (IS) were separated on two 5 &mu;m Chrompac ChromSpher Lipids columns (250 &times; 4.6 mm). Biological samples were hydrolyzed with 1M KOH in methanol and 2M KOH in water at room temperature for 12 h. Hydrolyzates were acidified and the free fatty acids were extracted with dichloromethane. The organic solvent was removed and then the residue was re-dissolved in hexane and centrifuged. The supernatant was injected onto the columns. The mobile phase of 1.6% acetic acid and 0.0125% acetonitrile in hexane was chosen as the optimum mobile phase for fractionation of IS, CLA isomers and CLA-metabolites in all assayed biological samples. The use of two silver ion-exchange columns with direct UV detection (Ag<sup>+</sup>-HPLC-DAD) offers satisfactory precision of the IS quantification and low limits of detection of IS and CLA isomers (0.60 and 0.21&ndash;0.35 ng, respectively). The presented simple Ag<sup>+</sup>-HPLC-DAD method with sorbic acid as the IS can be used for direct determination of underivatized CLA isomers in specimens of animal origin. &nbsp;  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetic acid 3aacetonitrile 3aambient temperature 3aanimal science 3aanimals 3aconjugated linoleic acid 3afractionation 3ahexane 3aion exchange 3amethanol 3amethylene chloride 3amilk 3asilver 3asolvents 3asorbic acid1 aKowalczyk, J.1 aMarounek, M.1 aMichalski, J.P.1 aRozbicka-Wieczorek, A.J.0 tCzech Journal of Animal Science.g, v. 56, no. 1 p.23-29dCzech Academy of Agricultural ScienceswJournal:14567x1212-18197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.17221/336/2009-cjas3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02925naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100002700138245009100165300001600256520140500272592002801677650002401705650002701729650002101756650000901777650001501786650001701801650002501818650001201843650001601855650002801871650001201899650002801911650001101939650001401950650001301964650001301977650001101990651001602001651001702017700001902034700001902053700002002072700002002092700001802112700001902130700002202149773014302171856007202314852000902386655001202395IND60661966220221120041841.0190904e20100210xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066196622DNAL7 a10.1039/b917452d2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPapu-Zamxaka, Vathiswa10aElevated mercury exposure in communities living alongside the Inanda Dam, South Africa  ap. 472-477.  aMercury is a persistent heavy metal that has been associated with damage to the central nervous system, including hearing and speech impairment, visual constriction and loss of muscle control. In aquatic environments mercury may be methylated to its most toxic form, methyl-mercury. In 1990 concerns were raised over mercury contamination in the vicinity of a mercury processing plant in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. Mercury waste was reported to have been discharged into the Mngceweni River, situated in close proximity to the plant. The Mngceweni River joins the uMgeni River, which in turn flows into the Inanda Dam, along the banks of which several villages are located. This study evaluated the mercury levels in river and dam sediments, fish from the Inanda Dam and hair samples collected from residents of three villages along the banks of the Inanda Dam. The study results showed that 50% of the fish samples and 17% of hair samples collected from villagers had mercury concentrations that exceeded guideline levels of the World Health Organization. Mercury concentrations in 62% of the river sediment samples collected in close proximity to the former mercury processing plant exceeded the level at which remedial action is required according to legislation in the Netherlands. These preliminary findings give reasons for concern and should be used as a baseline for further investigations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaquatic environment 3acentral nervous system 3adams (hydrology) 3afish 3aguidelines 3aheavy metals 3alaws and regulations 3amercury 3amethylation 3amethylmercury compounds 3amuscles 3anervous system diseases 3arivers 3asediments 3atoxicity 3avillages 3awastes 3aNetherlands 3aSouth Africa1 aMathee, Angela1 aHarpham, Trudy1 aBarnes, Brendon1 aRöllin, Halina1 aLyons, Michal1 aJordaan, Wikus1 aCloete, Marthinus0 tJournal of environmental monitoring.g2010 Feb. 10, v. 12, no. 2 p.472-477dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:27191x1464-03337nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/b917452d3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02915naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245014000158500001400298520139200312592002801704650002501732650001801757650001401775650002701789650001601816650001401832650001101846650001601857650002601873650001601899650001601915650002001931650001801951650001001969650002001979650001401999650002102013650001302034650001902047650002002066650001002086700001602096700001402112700001802126700001702144700001802161773012202179856007502301852000902376655001202385IND60703451420221121122156.0200721e20200304xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070345142DNAL7 a10.3390/nu120306922doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Pengzu 14aThe Effects of Endoplasmic-Reticulum-Resident Selenoproteins in a Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease Pig Model Induced by a High-Fat Diet  aNAL-light  aThe present study aimed to investigate the intervention of selenium in the oxidative stress and apoptosis of pig livers, which were induced by a high-fat diet, and the effects of four endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-resident selenoproteins in the process. A 2 × 4 design trial was conducted that included two dietary fat levels (BD = basal diet and HFD = high-fat diet) and four dietary Se supplementation levels (0, 0.3, 1.0, and 3.0 mg/kg of the diet, in the form of sodium selenite (Na₂SeO₃)). Our results indicated that the HFD significantly increased the activities of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) in the serum, as well as the degree of steatosis, the content of malondialdehyde (MDA), the apoptotic rate, and the level of mRNA caspase-3 in the liver compared to their BD counterparts (p < 0.05). Moreover, these parameters in the HFD groups were more significantly reduced (p < 0.05) for a Se concentration of 1.0 mg/kg than for the other concentrations. Further, for both the BD and HFD, the groups supplemented with 1.0 mg/kg Se showed the highest mRNA level of selenoprotein S. In conclusion, the consumption of an HFD can induce oxidative damage and apoptosis in the liver. This shows that the supplementation of Se at 1.0 mg/kg may be the optimum concentration against damage induced by HFD, and Sels may play a key role in this process.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalanine transaminase 3aanimal models 3aapoptosis 3aaspartate transaminase 3ablood serum 3acaspase-3 3adesign 3adietary fat 3aendoplasmic reticulum 3aexhibitions 3afatty liver 3agene expression 3ahigh fat diet 3aliver 3amalondialdehyde 3anutrients 3aoxidative stress 3aselenium 3aselenoproteins 3asodium selenite 3aswine1 aLu, Zhuang 1 aHe, Meng 1 aShi, Baoming 1 aLei, Xingen 1 aShan, Anshan 0 tNutrients.g2020 Mar. 04, v. 12, no. 3dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2271x2072-66437nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu120306923Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04072naa a2200769 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002700153245014300180300001600323520180100339592002802140650002102168650002002189650002602209650002202235650002902257650002902286650002702315650002602342650001702368650001302385650001302398650001202411650001302423650001102436650002502447650001902472650001402491650001502505650002602520650002502546650001702571650001102588650000902599650000902608650001402617650001102631650001402642650000902656650001302665650001202678650001602690650001902706650000902725651000902734651001402743653001302757653002802770653002602798653001702824653002702841653001402868700002402882700006502906700002102971700002602992700002703018700002503045773012303070856008803193852000903281655001203290IND60562467120221122074217.0181011e20170415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056246712DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2017.01.1212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWeerasundara, Lakshika10aMicroorganisms and heavy metals associated with atmospheric deposition in a congested urban environment of a developing country: Sri Lanka  ap. 803-812.  aThe presence of bacteria and heavy metals in atmospheric deposition were investigated in Kandy, Sri Lanka, which is a typical city in the developing world with significant traffic congestion. Atmospheric deposition samples were analyzed for Al, Cr, Mn, Fe, Ni, Cu, Zn, Cd and Pb which are heavy metals common to urban environments. Al and Fe were found in high concentrations due to the presence of natural sources, but may also be re-suspended by vehicular traffic. Relatively high concentrations of toxic metals such as Cr and Pb in dissolved form were also found. High Zn loads can be attributed to vehicular emissions and the wide use of Zn coated roofing materials. The metal loads in wet deposition showed higher concentrations compared to dry deposition. The metal concentrations among the different sampling sites significantly differ from each other depending on the traffic conditions. Industrial activities are not significant in Kandy City. Consequently, the traffic exerts high influence on heavy metal loadings. As part of the bacterial investigations, nine species of culturable bacteria, namely; Sphingomonas sp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas monteilii, Klebsiella pneumonia, Ochrobactrum intermedium, Leclercia adecarboxylata, Exiguobacterium sp., Bacillus pumilus and Kocuria kristinae, which are opportunistic pathogens, were identified. This is the first time Pseudomonas monteilii and Ochrobactrum intermedium has been reported from a country in Asia. The culturable fraction constituted ~0.01 to 10%. Pigmented bacteria and endospore forming bacteria were copious in the atmospheric depositions due to their capability to withstand harsh environmental conditions. The presence of pathogenic bacteria and heavy metals creates potential human and ecosystem health risk.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillus pumilus 3aExiguobacterium 3aKlebsiella pneumoniae 3aKocuria kristinae 3aLeclercia adecarboxylata 3aOchrobactrum intermedium 3aPseudomonas aeruginosa 3aPseudomonas monteilii 3aSphingomonas 3aaluminum 3abacteria 3acadmium 3achromium 3acopper 3adeveloping countries 3adry deposition 3aemissions 3aendospores 3aenvironmental factors 3aenvironmental health 3aheavy metals 3ahumans 3airon 3alead 3amanganese 3anickel 3apathogens 3arisk 3atoxicity 3atraffic 3aurban areas 3awet deposition 3azinc 3aAsia 3aSri Lanka 0aBacteria 0aOpportunistic pathogens 0aAtmospheric pollution 0aHeavy metals 0aWet and dry deposition 0aSri Lanka1 aAmarasekara, R.W.K.1 aMagana-Arachchi, D.N.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5825-46261 aZiyath, Abdul M.1 aKarunaratne, D.G.G.P.1 aGoonetilleke, Ashantha1 aVithanage, Meththika0 tScience of the total environment.g2017 Apr. 15, v. 584-585 p.803-812dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2017.01.1213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02111naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006000148245008500208300001600293520094600309592002801255650001901283650001001302650001001312650002901322650001201351650001401363650000901377650001301386650001501399651002601414700001701440700002101457700002301478773014401501856008301645852000901728655001201737IND60755359820221120075446.0211030e202111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075535982DNAL7 a10.1007/s00128-021-03325-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHartup, Barry K.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5137-596X10aBlood Mercury in Three Populations of Endangered Whooping Crane (Grus americana)  ap. 809-813.  aWe investigated concentrations of blood total mercury (THg) in three extant populations of endangered Whooping Crane (Grus americana). Blood THg was greater in cranes reintroduced during 2001–2008 that range in the eastern US (median = 0.31 ug/g ww) than both wild cranes in central North America (median = 0.11 ug/g ww) and from captivity (median = 0.01 ug/g ww). The median THg blood concentrations in the two free-ranging populations of Whooping Cranes were low compared to reproductive toxic thresholds suggested for other large bird species (> 4.3 ug/g ww), but a singular elevated concentration was observed in one crane (1.04 ug/g ww; 6% of samples from the reintroduced population). These results likely reflect variable dietary Hg exposure among these populations, but should prompt additional biomonitoring to discern risk of greater Hg exposure nearer to the time of breeding and potential effects on productivity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGrus americana 3abirds 3ablood 3aenvironmental monitoring 3amercury 3apollution 3arisk 3atoxicity 3atoxicology 3aEastern United States1 aSmith, Paige1 aWarner, Sarah E.1 aMcPhee, M.

Cells were cultured using LEDs applied as: Red (R), Blue (B), 80% Red+20% Blue (80%R–20%B), 80% Blue+20% Red (80%B-20%R) and cool-white (CW) (control) under a photon flux density (PFD) of 50 ± 5 μmol m⁻² s⁻¹. R and B-LEDs yielded a lower lipid content than mixed-colored LEDs (80%R–20%B and 80%B-20%R). The microalgae had the highest lipid content of 50.13% under 80%R-20%B-LED illumination. The main fatty acid in B. braunii was oleic acid (C18:1) reaching the highest value of 52.79%. The highest power efficiency for biomass was obtained from 80%R to 20%B-LED. Multivariate statistical cluster analysis showed that 80%R-20%B-LED had a power efficiency of biomass 153.96 mg L⁻¹ kWh⁻¹ and a power efficiency of lipid 77.18 mg L⁻¹ kWh⁻¹, a cetane number of 50, an iodine value of 102 g I₂ 100 g⁻¹, an unsaturation degree of 111.1% and a cold filter plugging point of −7.8 °C for energy-efficient and qualified biodiesel production.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBotryococcus braunii 3abiodiesel 3abiomass 3acluster analysis 3acold 3aenergy efficiency 3afatty acid composition 3aiodine value 3alighting 3alipid content 3amicroalgae 3aoleic acid 3aphotons 0aB. braunii (SAG 807-1) 0aGrowth 0aLED 0aBiodiesel properties 0aEnergy analysis 0aPower efficiency1 aEkinci, K.1 aUysal, Ö.0 tRenewable energy.g2022 Mar., v. 186 p.66-73dElsevier LtdwJournal:11970x0960-14817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.renene.2021.12.1423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02647naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001400146245010900160300001600269520129500285592002801580650003401608650001301642650001801655650000901673650002301682650001301705650001701718700006001735700005701795700001801852700001301870700001801883700001401901700005601915700005601971773013302027856008002160852000902240655001202249IND60605549420221119165700.0180721e20180118xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060554942DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcb.7b069892doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYe, Yifan10aStrong O 2p–Fe 3d Hybridization Observed in Solution-Grown Hematite Films by Soft X-ray Spectroscopies  ap. 927-932.  aPhotoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting holds the potential as a direct route for solar energy conversation and storage. The performance of a PEC device is strongly influenced by the electronic properties of the photonanode surface. It has been shown that the synthesis methods can have a profound impact on the electronic properties and PEC performance of various photoelectrode materials such as hematite. Soft X-ray spectroscopic techniques, including O K-edge XAS and Fe L-edge XAS/XES, have been employed to investigate how the synthesis methods impact the electronic structure of resulting hematite materials. It is found that the hematite samples via solution regrowth methods show dramatically increased 3d–4sp band ratios in O K-edge XAS spectra and decreased relative elastic peak intensities in Fe L-edge RIXS spectra compared with samples synthesized via ALD or solution grown. The difference observed in O–K and Fe–L spectra indicated that solution regrowth strategy alters the O 2p–Fe 3d hybridization and hence the electronic structure of the hematite films, which proves to be beneficial for PEC performance of the hematite photoanode. Our findings provided new insights and potentially useful strategies for enhancing the PEC performance of photoanode materials.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray absorption spectroscopy 3ahematite 3ahybridization 3airon 3aphysical chemistry 3aregrowth 3asolar energy1 aThorne, James E.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7711-428X1 aWu, Cheng Hao1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6515-09881 aLiu, Yi-Sheng1 aDu, Chun1 aJang, Ji-Wook1 aLiu, Erik1 aWang, Dunwei1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5581-87991 aGuo, Jinghua1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8576-21720 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2018 Jan. 18, v. 122, no. 2 p.927-932dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19284x1520-52077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcb.7b069893Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02699naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100005900149245009700208300001600305520134600321592002801667650001101695650001101706650002401717650001901741650001101760650001401771650001201785650002601797650001201823650002301835650001001858651001001868653002901878653001701907653001201924653002301936653001001959700002401969700002301993700002202016773011102038856008302149852000902232655001202241IND60544650820221120144612.0190417e201501  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054465082DNAL7 a10.1016/j.gecco.2015.01.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuil, Francisco1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0644-952510aSpace–time trends in Spanish bird electrocution rates from alternative information sources  ap. 379-388.  aInteraction with man-made infrastructures is one of the main sources of non-natural bird mortality. Here, we use a long-term study (1980–2010) to analyse spatial and temporal patterns in avian electrocution in Spain, using ringed birds as well as published reports and articles as information sources. Electrocution rates of ringed birds differ from rates obtained in unringed species. Electrocution rates are likely seasonally asymmetrical and are not constant across study periods: between 1990 and 2005 an annual rising trend of 5% was observed, whereas between 2006 and 2010 this trend decreased (16% annually). From the literature, we confirmed this decreasing trend. However, when we consider large eagles (Aquila genus), which include several of the most threatened bird species in Spain, this decreasing trend is not evident. The results of the analysis of different environmental and socio-economic factors affecting bird electrocution rates are similar between ringed birds and traditional power line surveys. Our modelling suggests three common factors that influence mortality rates: number of hunted rabbits, tree coverage and length of the power line network. Thus, the use of alternative information sources to detect high mortality areas due to electrocution by power lines may be a useful tool to complement other methods.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAquila 3aeagles 3ainformation sources 3ainfrastructure 3amodels 3amortality 3arabbits 3asocioeconomic factors 3asurveys 3athreatened species 3atrees 3aSpain 0aElectrocution assessment 0aBird ringing 0aRaptors 0aRinging recoveries 0aSpain1 aÀngels Colomer, M.1 aMoreno-Opo, Rubén1 aMargalida, Antoni0 tGlobal ecology and conservation.g2015 Jan., v. 3 p.379-388dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23212x2351-98947nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gecco.2015.01.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02172naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100002900112245010000141300001600241520097100257592002801228650002701256650002301283650001101306650001601317650001601333650001801349650002701367650001201394650002701406650001301433650002101446650001401467653002701481653001301508653001501521653001601536700002001552700002201572700002201594773012501616852000901741655001201750IND60747713520221119113839.0210818e202106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074771352DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMohapatra, Sandeep Kumar10aInvasive alien species yellow crazy ant- hemipterans mutualism and assessment of unicoloniality  ap. 728-730.  aThe present study dealt with the report of the mutualistic relationship between the yellow crazy ants Anoplolepis gracilipes and three groups of the order Hemiptera: plant hopper Leptocentrus taurus Fabricius, 1775 of the family Membracidae, scale insects Lecanium sp. of the family Coccoidea, and mealybugs Phenacoccus sp. of the family Pseudococcidae. These hemipteran bugs are providing honeydew as a source of carbohydrate to the yellow crazy ant, which is essential for the growth and development of the ant population. I n return, the crazy ants are protecting these insects from predators like ant-mimicking spiders Myrmarachne sp. and garden lizards Calotes versicolor (Daudin, 1802). This mutualistic ecological interaction may be one of the causes of the success of invasiveness of the yellow crazy in Ganjam, Odisha. In this invaded area unicoloniality of the ant nets have been noticed, which is adding to the adaptive advantage of this invasive species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAnoplolepis gracilipes 3aCalotes versicolor 3aCoccus 3aMembracidae 3aPhenacoccus 3acarbohydrates 3aecological competition 3agardens 3agrowth and development 3ahoneydew 3ainvasive species 3amutualism 0aEcological interaction 0aPolydomy 0aPolygynous 0aSupercolony1 aMishra, Pabitra1 aBehera, Rajashree1 aSeth, Jaya Kishor0 tIndian journal of ecology.g2021 June, v. 48, no. 3 p.728-730dIndian Ecological SocietywJournal:16635x0304-52507nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle03699naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100005900153245010900212520218400321592002802505650002902533650002802562650001502590650001802605650001702623650001102640650001902651650003302670650001402703650001702717650002502734650001502759651001202774653002802786653001202814653002502826653002902851653002102880700002702901700001902928700002302947700002002970700002002990773011003010856008803120852000903208655001203217IND60761817920221119115938.0220118e20220201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076181792DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2021.1059002doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEl Ouaty, Otman1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0593-435810aAssessment of the heavy metal sources and concentrations in the Nador Lagoon sediment, Northeast-Morocco  aThis study investigates the heavy metals (HM) and sulfurs concentration, enrichment level and potential sources in the bottom sediments of Nador lagoon, North-East Morocco. 50 samples of sediments from Nador lagoon heavy metals were analyzed by ICP-MS, while their spatial distribution and source identification were evaluated by Enrichment Factor (EF), QGis Inverse Distances Weighted (IDW) interpolation models, multivariate statistical techniques (Principal Component Analysis - Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering - Pearson correlation matrix), Positive matrix factorization (PMF model) and grain size/organic matter analysis. The average heavy metal concentrations in the sediments are in the decreasing order: Sr > Ba > V > Zr > Zn > Cr > Rb > La > Cu > Pb > Ni > Ce > Nd > Co > Sc > Nb > Ga > Th > Y > Hf, and the Sulfurs. The results showed that the average concentrations of the S, Sr, Pb, and Nd in bottom sediments were higher than their background contents. The EF values demonstrated that HM contents were enriched by anthropogenic activities, especially for Sr and S, and secondly for Th, V, Ce, Nd, and Pb. The potential HM and sulfurs identified sources showed that: 1) Ga, Y, Hf, Nb, Rb, Sc, Zr, Nb, Co, Zn, Th, Ni, V, Ba, Cr, and Cu were derived industrial activities related to stealing and mining; 2) Wastewater treatment station and lagoon watershed were the main sources of Sr in the lagoon; 3) Zn, Cu, and Pb also linked to sulfurs, mostly origin from agriculture inputs and mining activities; 4) Ce, Cr, and Ni linked to sulfurs, mainly origin form metallurgical activities and solid wastes. The results suggest that heavy metal concentrations were significantly affected anthropogenic activities.

There are different types of pollutants and techniques to eliminate them from the environment. We hereby report an efficient method for the remediation of environmental contaminants through the catalytic reduction of the selected pollutants. A green method has been developed for the immobilization of copper nanoparticles on magnetic lignosulfonate (Cu NPs@Fe₃O₄-LS) using the aqueous extract of Filago arvensis L. as a non-toxic reducing and stabilizing agent. The characterization of the prepared Cu NPs@Fe₃O₄-LS was achieved by vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM), Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), high resolution TEM (HRTEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning TEM (STEM), thermogravimetry-differential thermal analysis (TG/DTA), fast Fourier transform (FFT), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), and X-ray photoelectron (XPS) analyses. The synthesized Cu NPs@Fe₃O₄-LS was applied as a magnetic and green catalyst in the reduction of congo red (CR), 4-nitrophenol (4-NP), and methylene blue (MB). The progress of the reduction reactions was monitored by UV–Vis spectroscopy. Finally, the biological properties of Cu NPs@Fe₃O₄-LS were investigated. The prepared catalyst demonstrated excellent catalytic efficiency in the reduction of CR, 4-NP, and MB in the presence of sodium borohydride (NaBH₄) as the reducing agent. The appropriate magnetism of Cu NPs@Fe₃O₄-LS made its recovery very simple. The advantages of this process include a simple reaction set-up, high and catalytic antibacterial/antioxidant activities, short reaction time, environmentally friendliness, high stability, and easy separation of the catalyst. In addition, the prepared Cu NPs@Fe₃O₄-LS could be reused for four cycles with no significant decline in performance.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-radiation 3aX-ray diffraction 3aantioxidants 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3acopper nanoparticles 3aenergy-dispersive X-ray analysis 3ahuman health 3alignosulfonates 3amagnetism 3amethylene blue 3ap-nitrophenol 3apollution 3aremediation 3asodium borohydride 3atoxicology 3atransmission electron microscopy 3aultraviolet-visible spectroscopy 0aLignosulfonate 0aGreen method 0aEnvironmental pollutants 0aReduction 0aAntibacterial 0aAntioxidant 0aCatalysis1 aKarimkhani, Mohammad Mahdi1 aNasrollahzadeh, Mahmoud1 aJavanshir, Shahrzad1 aJamshidi, Abdollah1 aOrooji, Yasin1 aJang, Ho Won1 aShokouhimehr, Mohammadreza0 tFood and chemical toxicology.g2022 Oct., v. 168 p.113310-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl33424x0278-69157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fct.2022.1133103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03823naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001600152245008900168300001400257520254800271592002802819650001302847650002202860650001702882650001802899650001102917650002002928650002402948650001602972650002102988651001003009653001503019653001103034653002103045653001303066653001503079653001103094653000803105700001903113700002203132700001703154773009903171856008603270852000903356655001203365IND60583824920221120035328.0171024e20161015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058382492DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enconman.2016.07.0672doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHafez, A.Z.10aSolar parabolic dish Stirling engine system design, simulation, and thermal analysis  ap. 60-75.  aModeling and simulation for different parabolic dish Stirling engine designs have been carried out using Matlab®. The effect of solar dish design features and factors such as material of the reflector concentrators, the shape of the reflector concentrators and the receiver, solar radiation at the concentrator, diameter of the parabolic dish concentrator, sizing the aperture area of concentrator, focal Length of the parabolic dish, the focal point diameter, sizing the aperture area of receiver, geometric concentration ratio, and rim angle have been studied. The study provides a theoretical guidance for designing and operating solar parabolic dish Stirling engines system. At Zewail city of Science and Technology, Egypt, for a 10kW Stirling engine; The maximum solar dish Stirling engine output power estimation is 9707W at 12:00PM where the maximum beam solar radiation applied in solar dish concentrator is 990W/m2 at 12:00PM. The performance of engine can be improved by increasing the precision of the engine parts and the heat source efficiency. The engine performance could be further increased if a better receiver working fluid is used. We can conclude that where the best time for heating the fluid and fasting the processing, the time required to heat the receiver to reach the minimum temperature for operating the Solar-powered Stirling engine for different heat transfer fluids; this will lead to more economic solar dish systems.Power output of the solar dish system is one of the most important targets in the design that show effectiveness of the system, and this has achieved when we take into account many factors in the design of the solar dish system. One of these factors is the reflector material of the concentrator and using the results from the Matlab simulation program; where the Polymeric Film, Non Metal reflectors, with a net conversion power of more than 97.07%, still holds the conversion record than the Anod Aluminum reflectors, which has a net conversion power 85.97% with respect to the polished stainless reflectors with a net conversion power 49.52% from the 10kW Stirling engine. Where the power output differ as 9707, 4952, 8597W, respectively from the 10kW Stirling engine. It is shown that there are changes in Stirling power output for different materials, which guide us to select the optimum material, based on the targeted power output and cost. Our target to reach the optimum power that we need it in the design 10kW power output design as an example from the solar dish Stirling engine.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaluminum 3acomputer software 3aengine parts 3aheat transfer 3amodels 3asolar radiation 3asystems engineering 3atemperature 3athermal analysis 3aEgypt 0aSolar dish 0aDesign 0aThermal analysis 0aStirling 0aSimulation 0aMatlab 0aGUI1 aSoliman, Ahmed1 aEl-Metwally, K.A.1 aIsmail, I.M.0 tEnergy conversion and management.g2016 Oct. 15, v. 126 p.60-75dElsevier Ltdx0196-89047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enconman.2016.07.0673Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02465naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245012500159300002000284520139400304592002801698650002201726650002501748650001401773650001301787650001901800650003201819650003701851700002101888700002301909773012401932856007402056852000902130655001202139IND60641625720221120201958.0190505e20170424xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064162572DNAL7 a10.1039/c7ra02889j2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMohamed, Tarek10aApplication of quinazoline and pyrido[3,2-d]pyrimidine templates to design multi-targeting agents in Alzheimer's disease  ap. 22360-22368.  aA quinazoline and pyrido[3,2-d]pyrimidine based compound library was designed, synthesized and evaluated as multi-targeting agents aimed at Alzheimer's disease (AD). The SAR studies identified compound 8h (8-chloro-N²-isopropyl-N⁴-phenethylquinazoline-2,4-diamine) as a potent inhibitor of Aβ40 aggregation (IC₅₀ = 900 nM) which was 3.6-fold more potent compared to the reference agent curcumin (Aβ40 IC₅₀ = 3.3 μM). It also exhibited dual ChE inhibition (AChE IC₅₀ = 8.6 μM; BuChE IC₅₀ = 2.6 μM). Compound 9h (8-chloro-N⁴-(3,4-dimethoxyphenethyl)-N²-isopropylquinazoline-2,4-diamine) was identified as the most potent Aβ42 aggregation inhibitor (IC₅₀ ∼ 1.5 μM). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) imaging demonstrates their anti-Aβ40/Aβ42 aggregation properties. Compound 8e was identified as a potent BuChE inhibitor (BuChE IC₅₀ = 100 nM) which was 36-fold more potent compared to donepezil (BuChE IC₅₀ = 3.6 μM). The pyrido[3,2-d]pyrimidine bioisostere 10b (N²-isopropyl-N⁴-phenethylpyrido[3,2-d]pyrimidine-2,4-diamine) exhibited good anti-Aβ activity (Aβ40 IC₅₀ = 1.1 μM), dual ChE inhibition and iron-chelating properties (23.6% chelation at 50 μM). These investigations demonstrate the usefulness of either a quinazoline or a pyrido[3,2-d]pyrimidine based ring scaffold in the design of multi-targeting agents to treat AD.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAlzheimer disease 3aacetylcholinesterase 3achelation 3acurcumin 3aimage analysis 3ainhibitory concentration 50 3atransmission electron microscopy1 aMann, Mandeep K.1 aRao, Praveen P.

Impaired CBF results in reduced delivery of oxygen and nutrients, which can damage the brain over time. Thus, there is a need to identify lifestyle interventions, including diet and exercise, to maintain CBF with aging and in the presence of chronic disease. In the present study, we used transcranial Doppler ultrasound to record middle cerebral artery velocity (MCAv), a surrogate measure of CBF, during moderate-intensity exercise in sedentary, cognitively normal older adults (n = 90). A multiple linear regression model (F(4, 85) = 3.21, p = 0.02) showed that self-reported omega-3 supplement use significantly moderated the association between age and mean exercising MCAv in these individuals (p = 0.01). Older age was associated with lower exercising MCAv in the group not taking omega-3 supplements, while exercising MCAv showed no decline with increasing age in the group who reported omega-3 supplement use. These findings suggest omega-3 supplementation may have an important role in the preservation of CBF with aging.  aPublisher supplied data 3aage 3ablood flow 3abrain 3achronic diseases 3adecline 3adementia 3adiet 3aelderly 3aexercise 3alifestyle 3alongevity 3anutrients 3aoxygen 3aregression analysis 3astroke 3aultrasonography 3avelocity1 aVidoni, Eric  D.1 aBurns, Jeffrey M.,1 aAlwatban, Mohammed  R.1 aBillinger, Sandra  A.0 tNutrients.g2020 Mar. 05, v. 12, no. 3dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2271x2072-66437nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu120306973Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02971naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001900164245013700183300001700320520136700337592002801704650002301732650001601755650001801771650001101789650001501800650003101815650001001846650000701856650002001863650001301883650002701896650002901923650001701952650003101969650005802000650002402058650002202082650004102104700001602145700001902161700001702180700001602197700001802213700001402231700001802245773012102263856004802384852000902432655001202441IND4474621420221118082106.0121003e201203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447462142DNAL7 a228058202pmid7 a10.1007/s11274-011-0897-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuo, Wei-Liang10aAt-line monitoring of key parameters of nisin fermentation by near infrared spectroscopy, chemometric modeling and model improvement  ap. 993-1002.  aAn analytical procedure has been developed for at-line (fast off-line) monitoring of 4 key parameters including nisin titer (NT), the concentration of reducing sugars, cell concentration and pH during a nisin fermentation process. This procedure is based on near infrared (NIR) spectroscopy and Partial Least Squares (PLS). Samples without any preprocessing were collected at intervals of 1 h during fifteen batch of fermentations. These fermentation processes were implemented in 3 different 5 l fermentors at various conditions. NIR spectra of the samples were collected in 10 min. And then, PLS was used for modeling the relationship between NIR spectra and the key parameters which were determined by reference methods. Monte Carlo Partial Least Squares (MCPLS) was applied to identify the outliers and select the most efficacious methods for preprocessing spectra, wavelengths and the suitable number of latent variables (n LV). Then, the optimum models for determining NT, concentration of reducing sugars, cell concentration and pH were established. The correlation coefficients of calibration set (R c) were 0.8255, 0.9000, 0.9883 and 0.9581, respectively. These results demonstrated that this method can be successfully applied to at-line monitor of NT, concentration of reducing sugars, cell concentration and pH during nisin fermentation processes.  aPublisher supplied data 3abatch fermentation 3acorrelation 3aleast squares 3amodels 3amonitoring 3anear-infrared spectroscopy 3anisin 3apH 3areducing sugars 3asampling 2aBiotechnologyxmethods 2aCulture Mediaxchemistry 2aFermentation 2aHydrogen-Ion Concentration 2aLactococcus lactisxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aModels, Statistical 2aNisinxmetabolism 2aSpectroscopy, Near-Infraredxmethods1 aDu, Yi-Ping1 aZhou, Yong-Can1 aYang, Shuang1 aLu, Jia-Hui1 aZhao, Hong-Yu1 aWang, Yao1 aTeng, Li-Rong0 tWorld journal of microbiology & biotechnology.g2012 Mar., v. 28, no. 3 p.993-1002dSpringer-Verlagx0959-39937nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11274-011-0897-x  aDNAL 7aarticle02273naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245008500165500002200250520104400272592002801316650001701344650000901361650001601370650002601386650002201412650002201434650001601456650002601472653001601498653002601514653001001540653002201550653003801572653001801610653001701628700002001645700001901665773007601684856008201760852000901842655001201851IND60560348420221117184420.0170105s2016    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056034842DNAL7 a10.1016/j.trac.2016.12.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLucci, Paolo10aTrends in LC-MS and LC-HRMS analysis and characterization of polyphenols in food  aPre-press version  aPolyphenols comprise a large family of naturally occurring secondary metabolites of plant-derived foods and are among the principal micronutrients associated with the health beneficial effects of our diet. Liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (LC-MS) and, in the last few years, high resolution mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS) is playing an important role in the research of polyphenols, not only for the determination of this family of compounds in food matrices, but also for the characterization and identification of new polyphenols, as well as the classification and authentication of natural extracts in the prevention of frauds. The purpose of this review is to describe recent advances in the LC-MS and LC-HRMS analysis and characterization of polyphenols in food focusing on the most relevant applications published in the last years. Trends regarding sample treatment, chromatographic separation, mass analyzers and chemometric approaches used in the determination and characterization of polyphenols will be addressed.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemometrics 3adiet 3afood matrix 3aliquid chromatography 3amass spectrometry 3aplant-based foods 3apolyphenols 3asecondary metabolites 0aPolyphenols 0aLiquid chromatography 0aUHPLC 0aMass spectrometry 0aHigh-resolution mass spectrometry 0aFood analysis 0aChemometrics1 aSaurina, Javier1 aNuñez, Oscar,0 tTrends in analytical chemistry.g2016, dElsevier B.V.x0165-99367nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.trac.2016.12.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03130naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002500142245009200167300001800259520179500277592002802072650003002100650003102130650004402161650001402205650001302219650001302232650001302245650001302258650002402271650001302295650001102308650001602319700001902335700002102354700002302375700002202398700005702420773014602477856007602623852000902699655001202708IND60603908320221120134951.0180716e20180523xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060390832DNAL7 a10.1021/jacs.8b030722doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRatzloff, Michael W.10aCO-Bridged H-Cluster Intermediates in the Catalytic Mechanism of [FeFe]-Hydrogenase CaI  ap. 7623-7628.  aThe [FeFe]-hydrogenases ([FeFe] H₂ases) catalyze reversible H₂ activation at the H-cluster, which is composed of a [4Fe–4S]H subsite linked by a cysteine thiolate to a bridged, organometallic [2Fe–2S] ([2Fe]H) subsite. Profoundly different geometric models of the H-cluster redox states that orchestrate the electron/proton transfer steps of H₂ bond activation have been proposed. We have examined this question in the [FeFe] H₂ase I from Clostridium acetobutylicum (CaI) by Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy with temperature annealing and H/D isotope exchange to identify the relevant redox states and define catalytic transitions. One-electron reduction of Hₒₓ led to formation of HᵣₑdH⁺ ([4Fe–4S]H²⁺–Feᴵ–Feᴵ) and Hᵣₑd′ ([4Fe–4S]H¹⁺–Feᴵᴵ–Feᴵ), with both states characterized by low frequency μ-CO IR modes consistent with a fully bridged [2Fe]H. Similar μ-CO IR modes were also identified for HᵣₑdH⁺ of the [FeFe] H₂ase from Chlamydomonas reinhardtii (CrHydA1). The CaI proton-transfer variant C298S showed enrichment of an H/D isotope-sensitive μ-CO mode, a component of the hydride bound H-cluster IR signal, Hₕyd. Equilibrating CaI with increasing amounts of NaDT, and probed at cryogenic temperatures, showed HᵣₑdH⁺ was converted to Hₕyd. Over an increasing temperature range from 10 to 260 K catalytic turnover led to loss of Hₕyd and appearance of Hₒₓ, consistent with enzymatic turnover and H₂ formation. The results show for CaI that the μ-CO of [2Fe]H remains bridging for all of the “Hᵣₑd” states and that HᵣₑdH⁺ is on pathway to Hₕyd and H₂ evolution in the catalytic mechanism. These results provide a blueprint for designing small molecule catalytic analogs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChlamydomonas reinhardtii 3aClostridium acetobutylicum 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aannealing 3acysteine 3ageometry 3ahydrides 3ahydrogen 3ahydrogen production 3aisotopes 3amodels 3atemperature1 aArtz, Jacob H.1 aMulder, David W.1 aCollins, Reuben T.1 aFurtak, Thomas E.1 aKing, Paul W.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5039-654X0 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2018 May 23, v. 140, no. 24 p.7623-7628dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19166x1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jacs.8b030723Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02418naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245010400168300001600272520110300288592002801391650002001419650001901439650002001458650001401478650002401492650003001516650001501546650002301561651001001584653003201594653002301626653003201649653003501681653004501716700002201761700001601783773011501799856008501914852000901999655001202008IND60566125520221122064304.0170405e20170504xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056612552DNAL7 a10.1080/17538947.2016.12375712doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Xiaoming10aSimulation of permafrost changes on the Qinghai–Tibet Plateau, China, over the past three decades  ap. 522-538.  aPermafrost is one of the largest elements of the terrestrial cryosphere and is extremely sensitive to climate change. Based on mean annual ground temperature (MAGT) data from 189 boreholes on the Qinghai–Tibet Plateau (QTP), terrain factors, and climate data from China Meteorological Forcing Dataset, we propose a new mean annual ground air temperature (MAGAT) statistical model between meteorological parameters with subsurface temperatures to simulate permafrost distribution and variation of MAGT on the QTP over the past three decades (1981–2010). Validation of the model with MAGT data from 13 boreholes and permafrost maps of the QTP indicated that the MAGAT model is applicable to simulate the distribution and evolution of permafrost on the QTP. Simulation results show that the spatiotemporal MAGT of permafrost significantly increased by 0.37°C, or 0.25°C/10 yr, and the total area of permafrost decreased by 2.48 × 10 ⁵ km ² on the QTP over the past three decades. Regionally, the changes of permafrost in the southwestern QTP were greater than other regions of the QTP.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair temperature 3aclimate change 3adata collection 3aevolution 3ameteorological data 3ameteorological parameters 3apermafrost 3astatistical models 3aChina 0aThe Qinghai–Tibet Plateau 0apermafrost changes 0amean annual air temperature 0amean annual ground temperature 0amean annual ground air temperature model1 aZhang, Zhongqiong1 aWu, Qingbai0 tInternational journal of digital earth.g2017 May 4, v. 10, no. 5 p.522-538dTaylor & Francisx1753-89557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/17538947.2016.12375713Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02222naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002100155245009900176300001600275520113400291592002801425650001101453650001301464650001301477650002401490650001301514650001301527650001901540650002501559650000901584650002601593650001101619700002201630773007501652856008901727990002301816852000901839655001201848IND60096043120221119093008.0141104e201311  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009604312DNAL7 a10.1016/j.compositesb.2013.05.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBaradeswaran, A.10aInfluence of B₄C on the tribological and mechanical properties of Al 7075–B₄C composites  ap. 146-152.  aIn the present investigation, the influence of B₄C on the mechanical and Tribological behavior of Al 7075 composites is identified. Al 7075 particle reinforced composites were produced through casting, K₂TiF₆ added as the flux, to overcome the wetting problem between B₄C and liquid aluminium metal. The aluminium B₄C composites thus produced were subsequently subjected to T6 heat treatment. The samples of Al 7075 composites were tested for hardness, tensile, compression, flexural strengths and wear behavior. The test results showed increasing hardness of composites compared with the base alloy because of the presence of the increased ceramic phase. The wear resistance of the composites increased with increasing content of B₄C particles, and the wear rate was significantly less for the composite material compared to the matrix alloy. A mechanically mixed layer containing oxygen and iron was observed on the surface, and this acted as an effective insulation layer preventing metal to metal contact. The coefficient of friction decreased with increased B₄C content and reached its minimum at 10vol% B₄C.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalloys 3aaluminum 3aceramics 3acomposite materials 3afriction 3ahardness 3aheat treatment 3ainsulating materials 3airon 3amechanical properties 3aoxygen1 aElaya Perumal, A.0 tComposites.g2013 Nov., v. 54 p.146-152dElsevier Ltdx1359-83687nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.compositesb.2013.05.0123Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02386naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001900152245013000171300001600301520121800317592002801535650001801563650001601581650002601597650001301623650002101636650001101657650001501668700001901683700001901702700001901721700001701740700001701757700002201774700002101796773008801817856008601905852000901991655001202000IND60089130220221117193415.0141102e201211  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008913022DNAL7 a10.1016/j.atmosenv.2012.05.0282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJanssen, Stijn10aLand use to characterize spatial representativeness of air quality monitoring stations and its relevance for model validation  ap. 492-500.  aThe spatial representativeness of air quality monitoring stations is a crucial parameter when the observed concentration levels are used in an air quality assessment. Spatial representativeness defines to what extent the monitoring data is meaningful and useful in a spatial context. Within this paper a generic and robust methodology is presented for the assessment of the spatial representativeness of air pollution monitoring sites. The methodology relies on a statistical approach that links annual averaged concentration levels with land use characteristics. The methodology is demonstrated for the monitoring sites in the Belgian telemetric air quality network and then applied to define a set of zones with a given confidence level. Within such a zone the concentrations deviate to a maximum percentage from the measured values at the monitoring sites. Furthermore, the relevance of spatial representativeness for model validation is addressed and the technique is illustrated for the validation of the results of the regional air quality model BelEUROS. In general, the overall improvement of the model validation by taking into account spatial representativeness can be quantified as in the order of 20%.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair pollution 3aair quality 3aatmospheric chemistry 3aland use 3amodel validation 3amodels 3amonitoring1 aDumont, Gerwin1 aFierens, Frans1 aDeutsch, Felix1 aMaiheu, Bino1 aCelis, David1 aTrimpeneers, Elke1 aMensink, Clemens0 tAtmospheric environment.g2012 Nov., v. 59 p.492-500dElsevier Ltdx1352-23107nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.atmosenv.2012.05.0283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03038naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094024002200124024001900146040001800165100005900183245008800242300001800330506007600348520119800424592002801622506003701650650001601687650002701703650002801730650002101758650001301779650002101792650001101813650001901824650002401843650002201867650001301889650000901902650001201911650001301923650001301936650001501949650001101964650001701975700001901992700001902011700001602030700002202046700002102068700002002089700006402109700002102173700002302194773014602217856007602363852000902439655001202448IND60603908420221207133328.0180716e20180518xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060390842DNAL7 a10.1021/jacs.8b030742doi7 aPMC65986942pmcid7 a297750582pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Andrew C.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6756-474610aMultiple Click-Selective tRNA Synthetases Expand Mammalian Cell-Specific Proteomics  ap. 7046-7051.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBioorthogonal tools enable cell-type-specific proteomics, a prerequisite to understanding biological processes in multicellular organisms. Here we report two engineered aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases for mammalian bioorthogonal labeling: a tyrosyl (ScTyrY₄₃G) and a phenylalanyl (MmPheT₄₁₃G) tRNA synthetase that incorporate azide-bearing noncanonical amino acids specifically into the nascent proteomes of host cells. Azide-labeled proteins are chemoselectively tagged via azide–alkyne cycloadditions with fluorophores for imaging or affinity resins for mass spectrometric characterization. Both mutant synthetases label human, hamster, and mouse cell line proteins and selectively activate their azido-bearing amino acids over 10-fold above the canonical. ScTyrY₄₃G and MmPheT₄₁₃G label overlapping but distinct proteomes in human cell lines, with broader proteome coverage upon their coexpression. In mice, ScTyrY₄₃G and MmPheT₄₁₃G label the melanoma tumor proteome and plasma secretome. This work furnishes new tools for mammalian residue-specific bioorthogonal chemistry, and enables more robust and comprehensive cell-type-specific proteomics in live mammals.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aamino acids 3aaminoacyl tRNA ligases 3acycloaddition reactions 3afluorescent dyes 3ahamsters 3ahuman cell lines 3ahumans 3aimage analysis 3alabeling techniques 3amass spectrometry 3amelanoma 3amice 3amutants 3aproteins 3aproteome 3aproteomics 3aresins 3atransfer RNA1 adu Bois, Haley1 aOlsson, Niclas1 aGate, David1 aLehallier, Benoit1 aBerdnik, Daniela1 aBrewer, Kyle D.1 aBertozzi, Carolyn R.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4482-27541 aElias, Joshua E.1 aWyss-Coray, Anton,0 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2018 May 18, v. 140, no. 23 p.7046-7051dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19166x1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jacs.8b030743Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02686naa a2200877 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245011500166500002200281520058100303592002800884650001500912650002500927650002200952650002200974650002900996650001701025650002001042653001601062653002601078653001301104653000901117653001801126653000801144653000901152653000801161653000801169653000701177653001001184653001101194653000801205653000801213653001201221653001201233653000801245653001001253653001201263653000801275653000801283653000801291653000901299653000901308653000901317653000901326653000901335653000801344653000801352653000901360653000801369653000701377653000801384653000901392653000801401653000801409653000801417653000801425700001901433700001901452700001801471700001701489700002201506700001501528700001801543700001601561700001801577700001701595700001701612773007601629856008201705852000901787655001201796IND60560348620221121011557.0170105s2016    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056034862DNAL7 a10.1016/j.trac.2016.12.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Yong-Fang10aImmunochemical techniques for multianalyte analysis of chemical residues in food and the environment: A review  aPre-press version  aImmunoassay is an emerging technique that has been used in the fields of food and environmental analysis to monitor and control hazardous residues.

Finally, the limitations and prospects of MAIAs are discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantibodies 3aantibody specificity 3achemical analysis 3achemical residues 3aenvironmental assessment 3aimmunoassays 3aimmunochemistry 0aImmunoassay 0aMultianalyte analysis 0aAntibody 0aFood 0aEnvironmental 0aBSA 0aCAMM 0aCCD 0aCDR 0aCR 0aCoMFA 0aCoMSIA 0aDIF 0aDNA 0a2D-QSAR 0a3D-QSAR 0aDON 0aELISA 0aciELISA 0aFQs 0aHAT 0aHRP 0aIC50 0aMAIA 0aMCNs 0aMIPs 0aMRLs 0aQDs 0aOPs 0aPCBs 0aPCR 0aSA 0aSAR 0ascFv 0aSPR 0aTRO 0aVHH 0aZEN1 aSun, Yuan-Ming1 aBeier, Ross C.1 aLei, Hong-Tao1 aGee, Shirley1 aHammock, Bruce D.1 aWang, Hong1 aWang, Zhanhui1 aSun, Xiulan1 aShen, Yu-Dong1 aYang, Jin-Yi1 aXu, Zhen-Lin0 tTrends in analytical chemistry.g2016, dElsevier B.V.x0165-99367nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.trac.2016.12.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02745naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100006900149245015400218300001600372520118200388592002801570650001901598650000901617650002501626650003601651650001401687650002301701650001301724650002201737650000901759650001401768650002701782650001101809650002401820650001301844651001101857653001501868653002301883653002701906653001401933653002601947700002701973700003002000700003702030773009102067856008402158852000902242655001202251IND60582461120221121052311.0200103e201709  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058246112DNAL7 a10.1016/j.flora.2017.07.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBarônio, Gudryan Jackson1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2988-916810aCharacterization of Malpighiaceae flower-visitor interactions in a Brazilian savannah: How do floral resources and visitor abundance change over time  ap. 126-134.  aThe plants of Malpighiaceae are diverse and produce specific floral resources that provide a parameter of habitat quality for oil-collecting bees. We studied three species of Malpighiaceae from the Brazilian savannah, Banisteriopsis campestris, B. malifolia and Peixotoa tomentosa, and investigated (I) the quantitative and qualitative composition of floral resources and (II) the temporal distribution of floral visitors according to plant phenology. We used gas chromatography and mass spectrometry to determine the chemical composition of floral oil. We also quantified pollen weight and oil volume, and registered floral visitors and plant phenology. The floral resources varied quantitatively and qualitatively among plant species. The 31 observed bee species showed different preferences for the plant species, which also were related to reproductive periods and floral resources of the plants. According to sequential flowering of co-occurring species of Malpighiaceae, we argue that the qualitative and quantitative similarity of floral resources (oil and pollen) and their availability for bees throughout the year, benefits these interactions between plants and bees.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBanisteriopsis 3abees 3achemical composition 3achemical constituents of plants 3aflowering 3agas chromatography 3ahabitats 3amass spectrometry 3aoils 3aphenology 3aplant-insect relations 3apollen 3apollinating insects 3asavannas 3aBrazil 0aCentridini 0aChemical compounds 0aFloral oil composition 0aPhenology 0aPollen quantification1 aHaleem, Muhammad Abdul1 aMarsaioli, Anita Jocelyne1 aTorezan-Silingardi, Helena Maura0 tFlora.g2017 Sept., v. 234 p.126-134dElsevier GmbHwJournal:jnl51878x0367-25307nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.flora.2017.07.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01938naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002000155245014200175300001600317520094000333592002801273650002801301650001301329650001701342650001301359700001201372700001901384700002501403773007501428856008901503990002301592852000901615655001201624IND60096043220221119092822.0141104e201311  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009604322DNAL7 a10.1016/j.compositesb.2013.05.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, Sang-Young13aAn experimental and numerical study on the interference-fit pin installation process for cross-ply glass fiber reinforced plastics (GFRP)  ap. 153-162.  aInterference-fit pin connections provide beneficial effects such as fatigue enhancement to the fiber reinforced composites. An interference-fit pin installation process simulation using three-dimensional (3-D) finite element analysis (FEA) was conducted considering the friction coefficient (0.1) and interference-fit percentages (0.4% and 1.0%). During the simulation, the stress and strain distributions of GFRP when installing interference-fit pin were investigated. The radial and the tangential strains in the vicinity of the hole acquired from the FEA were compared with strain gauge experimental measurements, showing fairly good agreement. With increasing interference fit percent, the strain magnitudes increased after pin installation. For 1% interference-fit, micro-scale fiber damage occurred in local regions around hole during the pin installation experiments, while minimal damage was observed for 0.4% interference-fit.  aPublisher supplied data 3afinite element analysis 3afriction 3aglass fibers 3aplastics1 aHe, Bin1 aShim, Chun-Sik1 aKim, Dave (Dae-Wook)0 tComposites.g2013 Nov., v. 54 p.153-162dElsevier Ltdx1359-83687nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.compositesb.2013.05.0063Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03379naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001800155245011900173520193900292592002802231650002402259650001602283650001902299650001902318650000902337650001002346650001002356650001502366650004302381650002202424650001802446650002002464650001302484650000902497653002502506653001702531653002602548653001802574700002502592700002002617700002002637700002102657700002102678773009902699856009002798852000902888655001202897IND60741014620221120182037.0210715e20211015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074101462DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aquaculture.2021.7370172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNazari, Sajad10aTranscriptome profiling of farmed rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) liver from different sources of dietary zinc  aDietary zinc as an essential micronutrient plays a major role in controlling the rate of fish performance and reproduction. Given the liver is an important organ for metabolism and some receptors in the liver are critical for maintaining fertility, it has been hypothesized that it may contributes to reproductive indices. In the present work, we investigated the effects of feeding with different sources of zinc supplements on transcriptome profiling of male rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) broodstocks fed for 16 weeks on a diet supplemented with 40 mg. kg⁻¹ of mineral zinc supplement (MZ), 40 mg. kg⁻¹ of zinc nanoparticles (ZN) and control diet containing no zinc supplement (CD). Transcriptome sequencing analysis of the liver generated 39 million high-quality reads using an Illumina HiSeq™ 4000 platform, which were de novo assembled into 77,406 unique transcript fragments (unigenes) with mean length of 985 bp across the treatment groups. Subsequent bioinformatics analysis identified 528, 416 and 327 differentially expressed unigenes (DEGs) in liver in response to MZ, ZN and CD diets, respectively. Furthermore, eight immune-related genes were chosen for quantitative real-time PCR analysis to validate the RNA-Seq data and the result shown that one gene was downregulated and seven genes were upregulated, consistent with the results of our RNA-Seq analysis. The results revealed that mineral zinc supplement showed a strong inhibitory effect on the genes of O. mykiss. Dietary zinc in MZ up-regulated 89.4% of DEGs compared to ZN, however, 93.7% of the DEGs in CD were depressed compared to ZN. This transcriptomic research has provided valuable information for understanding the molecular mechanism and potential physiologically pathway of dietary zinc. These findings also provide molecular support to the notion that dietary zinc is useful materials in commercial diets for broodstock rainbow trout.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOncorhynchus mykiss 3aaquaculture 3abioinformatics 3abreeding stock 3adiet 3aliver 3amales 3ametabolism 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3asequence analysis 3atranscriptome 3atranscriptomics 3aunigenes 3azinc 0aBroodstock nutrition 0aDietary zinc 0aTranscriptome library 0aRainbow trout1 aPourkazemi, Mohammad1 aPaknejad, Hamed1 aKazemi, Esmaeil1 aGhaderi, Mostafa1 aEslamloo, Khalil0 tAquaculture.g2021 Oct. 15, v. 543 p.737017-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl59663x0044-84867nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaculture.2021.7370173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02735naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002400143245015800167300001400325520134600339592002801685650001801713650001601731650001901747650001101766650002301777650001101800651001101811651002201822651002501844651001801869653001301887653002101900653001801921653001401939653002301953700002501976700002102001700002502022700002002047700002302067773010002090856007802190852000902268655001202277IND60776998420221123033628.0220925e20220512xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077699842DNAL7 a10.1515/ami-2022-01172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBarboutis, Christos10aArriving depleted after crossing of the Mediterranean: obligatory stopover patterns underline the importance of Mediterranean islands for migrating birds  ap. 27-36.  aHundreds of millions of birds reach the Mediterranean islands or Mediterranean coast of Europe every spring after having crossed the Sahara Desert and the Mediterranean Sea. Using data from three small insular stopover sites, we calculated body mass without fuel for 18 trans-Saharan passerine migrants. We subsequently used arrival fuel loads coupled with potential flight range estimates to assess the percentage of birds that are forced to perform an obligatory stopover after crossing the Mediterranean Sea due to fuel depletion. Average arrival fuel loads were among the lowest ever recorded in the Mediterranean region and minimum body mass values recorded for several species were lower than any other individual value reported. The percentage of birds that needed to replenish their energy stores before resuming their northward migration journey varied from 0% to 50% depending on the species and locality studied. Based on conservative estimates at least 180 million birds of our study species are expected to migrate through Greece, 14% of which would not be able to resume their migration without refueling. The significance of small islands and coastal sites in the Mediterranean as obligatory refuelling sites is discussed and their conservation value for migratory birds is highlighted under the perspective of climate change.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPasseriformes 3abody weight 3aclimate change 3aenergy 3amigratory behavior 3aspring 3aGreece 3aMediterranean Sea 3aMediterranean region 3aSahara Desert 0aStopover 0aBarrier crossing 0aSmall islands 0aFuel load 0aConservation value1 aNavarrete, Elisabeth1 aKarris, Georgios1 aXirouchakis, Stavros1 aFransson, Thord1 aBounas, Anastasios0 tAnimal Migration.g2022 May 12, v. 9, no. 1 p.27-36dDe GruyterwJournal:26734x2084-88387nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1515/ami-2022-01173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04091naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002300155245013000178520252500308592002802833650002402861650001602885650002002901650001602921650002402937650001402961650001002975650001002985650002502995650001503020650001203035650001603047650001703063653001403080653001203094653002403106653002903130653002603159653002203185653000703207653000703214653000703221653000703228653000803235653000803243653000803251653000903259653000803268653000903276653000903285700002103294773009903315856009003414852000903504655001203513IND60741014720221120181951.0210715e20211015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074101472DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aquaculture.2021.7370282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTunçelli, Gökhan10aEffects of weekend starvation and the duration of daily feeding on production parameters of rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss  aIt would often be practical to starve the cultivated fishes over the weekends, e.g. to save in labour costs. We evaluated the possibility that domesticated juvenile rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) could compensate for the lost growth of the 2-day weekend starvation by either hyperphagic response and/or by lower feed conversion ratio, compared to the fish fed every day in an 8-week experiment. Rainbow trout (initial weight c. 30 g, temperature 16 °C) starved during the weekends were able to increase feed intake during the weekdays clearly above the intake of the control fish after the first two weekends, also seen as an increase of the compensation coefficients over the last four weeks of the experiment. However, the control fish had significantly greater total absolute feed intake than the fish in the treatment group inducing significantly higher specific growth rate and final weight (176.7 ± 4.7 g) compared to the treatment group (153.1 ± 8.4 g) at the end of the experiment. The coefficient of variation of weight did not differ between the two groups, but the feed conversion ratio was significantly higher in the 2-day starving group (0.93 ± 0.03) than in the control group (0.88 ± 0.01). Growth compensation was only partial, and our data indicated clear differences in the capacity for compensation between the tanks. The tank-wise compensation capacity appears to be rather persistent, seen as a significant positive correlation in the compensation coefficients between the first and last four weeks of the experiment. Body moisture and hepatosomatic index were significantly higher in the 2-day starving groups than in the control group, but there were no treatment differences in stomach capacity (weight or volume), liver weight or in the relative amount of visceral fat. The lack of the increase in stomach capacity in the treatment group fish was hypothesized to be a consequence of selective breeding for several decades and being an unnecessary trait in farmed fishes supplied feed constantly. We conducted also a 3-week follow-up experiment to test the effects of feeding frequency (continuous feeding vs. feeding twice per day) on growth responses in rainbow trout experiencing the weekend starvation, and these results confirmed that the lack of full growth compensation in the first experiment was not due to feeding frequency. Our results suggest that weekend starvation cannot be recommended for domesticated rainbow trout without negatively affecting their growth.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOncorhynchus mykiss 3aaquaculture 3afeed conversion 3afeed intake 3ahepatosomatic index 3ajuveniles 3alabor 3aliver 3aspecific growth rate 3astarvation 3astomach 3atemperature 3avisceral fat 0aSalmonids 0aFasting 0aCompensatory growth 0aCompensation coefficient 0aFeed conversion ratio 0aFeeding frequency 0aCC 0aCG 0aCV 0aCF 0aFCR 0aSGR 0aHSI 0aVFSI 0aTED 0aTEWD 0aCEWD1 aPirhonen, Juhani0 tAquaculture.g2021 Oct. 15, v. 543 p.737028-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl59663x0044-84867nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaculture.2021.7370283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03237naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002000149245008300169300001600252520177300268592002802041650002202069650001602091650000802107650001702115650001702132650001902149650001102168650001302179650001302192650001002205650000802215650002502223650000902248650003302257650001102290650001102301650001102312653001902323653001302342653002702355653002302382653002202405653002502427700005702452700002602509773009102535856008402626852000902710655001202719IND60582461220221121041517.0200103e201709  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058246122DNAL7 a10.1016/j.flora.2017.07.0182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchott, Rena T.10aExtracellular ice management in the frost hardy horsetail Equisetum hyemale L.  ap. 207-214.  aFormation of extracellular ice at specific positions in the plant interior is a common and probably essential component of plant cold hardiness. Studies on extracellular freezing in spore-bearing plants are, however, scarce. In this study, extracellular ice formation in the cold hardy horsetail Equisetum hyemale L. is analyzed. Horsetails show an extensive system of intercellular air spaces which are probably crucial for internal ice storage during winter. Previous studies emphasized the spacious pith cavity as the main place for ice crystal growth. Shoots were studied during summer and in the frozen state in winter, after natural acclimatization, by using digital (incident light) microscopy, Scanning Electron Microscopy and Cryo Scanning Electron Microscopy. It was shown that the vallecular canals also contain a large share of ice bodies under freezing conditions. The vallecular canals, which are directly seated within the cortex and whose interior is directly connected to the cortex via gaps in the canal wall, were often and rapidly filled with ice. The pith cavity also contained ice, depending on the position along the shoot and the internode. The carinal canals contained almost no ice crystals. Furthermore, some ice crystals were detected in the intercellular spaces of the chlorenchyma and the substomatal chamber. The stomatal antechamber, however, was always ice-free, probably due to the presence of water-repellent wax crystals. The results of this study support available evidence for the crucial role of pre-existing extensive lacunae for extracellular ice formation in E. hyemale. Furthermore, the findings indicate that anatomical details of canal structure and position are important for the pattern of extracellular ice accumulation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEquisetum hyemale 3aacclimation 3aair 3achlorenchyma 3acold storage 3acold tolerance 3acortex 3acrystals 3afreezing 3afrost 3aice 3aintercellular spaces 3apith 3ascanning electron microscopy 3ashoots 3asummer 3awinter 0aCold hardiness 0aCryo-SEM 0aExtracellular freezing 0aFreezing avoidance 0aVallecular canals 0aWinter scouring rush1 aVoigt, Dagmar1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2772-85041 aRoth-Nebelsick, Anita0 tFlora.g2017 Sept., v. 234 p.207-214dElsevier GmbHwJournal:jnl51878x0367-25307nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.flora.2017.07.0183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02872naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245013000167300001600297520132200313592002801635650001401663650002801677650002101705650001501726650001201741650001801753650001801771650002801789650001301817650001701830650000901847650001701856650001601873653004701889653003001936653002801966653003301994700001702027700005702044700001702101700002102118700005902139773009802198856008502296852000902381655001202390IND60787498320221121013021.0220914e202209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078749832DNAL7 a10.1016/j.renene.2022.07.0962doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSim, Jaebong14aThe effect of gas diffusion layer on electrochemical effective reaction area of catalyst layer and water discharge capability  ap. 932-942.  aA gas diffusion layer (GDL) is one of the main components of a proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC), which helps discharge the water generated by the electrochemical reaction and promotes the diffusion of reactant gases. The GDL typically consists of a microporous layer (MPL) and a substrate, and the MPL is mainly composed of carbon black and PTFE (polytetrafluoroethylene). In this study, to optimize the effective reaction area of the catalyst layer by increasing the specific surface area of the MPL and improve the water discharge capability of GDL by increasing the porosity of the MPL, the GDLs are manufactured by varying the manufacturing methods of the MPL. The MPL design parameters considered in this study are the particle size of carbon black, the addition of smaller carbon black particles to the MPL, and the number of cracks in the MPL. The performance tendencies are quantitatively identified through polarization curves, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, Brunauer-Emmett-Teller, electrochemical surface area, liquid water, water vapor, gas permeabilities, and capillary pressure gradient. The results showed that the MPL has a dominant effect on the electrochemical surface area (ECSA) of the catalyst layer and the mass transport resistance of the PEMFC.  aPublisher supplied data 3acatalysts 3adielectric spectroscopy 3aelectrochemistry 3afuel cells 3aliquids 3amass transfer 3aparticle size 3apolytetrafluoroethylene 3aporosity 3aporous media 3asoot 3asurface area 3awater vapor 0aProton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) 0aGas diffusion layer (GDL) 0aMicroporous layer (MPL) 0aElectrochemical surface area1 aKang, Minsoo1 aOh, Hwanyeong1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0480-00431 aLee, Eunsook1 aJyoung, Jy-Young1 aMin, Kyoungdoug1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1201-63120 tRenewable energy.g2022 Sept., v. 197 p.932-942dElsevier LtdwJournal:11970x0960-14817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.renene.2022.07.0963Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03455naa a2200637 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001400164245013200178300001600310520120300326592002801529650001901557650002201576650002801598650002201626650001401648650002401662650001001686650001801696650001401714650001301728650003301741650005301774650002401827650002801851650003601879650002301915650004601938650002301984650005902007650003802066650001902104650001302123650002802136650001302164650004202177650005402219650007802273650004202351650004602393650005702439650002802496650003302524650005602557700001902613700002202632773009402654856004802748852000902796655001202805IND4480925620221118223438.0120907e201210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448092562DNAL7 a221468672pmid7 a10.1007/s11248-011-9576-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDuan, Hui10aOverexpression of the wild potato eIF4E-1 variant Eva1 elicits Potato virus Y resistance in plants silenced for native eIF4E-1   ap. 929-938.  aPotato virus Y (PVY) is the most important viral pathogen of cultivated potato (Solanum tuberosum) from a commercial perspective, causing severe losses in both tuber quality and yield worldwide. Specific accessions of wild potato species exhibit resistance against PVY but efforts to transfer the trait to cultivated material have not yielded widely adopted varieties. Because amino acid substitutions at specific domains of host factor eIF4E-1 often confer resistance to various crops, we sequenced the associated genes expressed in wild potato plants. A novel eIF4E-1 variant, designated here as Eva1, was identified in S. chacoense, S. demissum, and S. etuberosum. The protein contains amino acid substitutions at ten different positions when compared to its cultivated potato (S. tuberosum) homolog. In the yeast two-hybrid system, Eva1 failed to bind VPg, a viral protein required for infectivity. Overexpression of the associated cDNA conferred PVY resistance to transgenic potato plants silenced for the native eIF4E-1 gene. Because the gene sources of Eva1 are sexually compatible with potato, the molecular strategies described can be employed to develop ‘intragenic’ potato cultivars.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPotato virus Y 3aSolanum tuberosum 3aamino acid substitution 3acomplementary DNA 3acultivars 3agene overexpression 3agenes 3apathogenicity 3apathogens 3apotatoes 3atwo hybrid system techniques 2aAgrobacterium tumefaciensxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAmino Acid Substitution 2aCapsicumxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aCloning, Molecular 2aDNA, Complementaryxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aDisease Resistance 2aEukaryotic Initiation Factor-4Exgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plant 2aGene Silencing 2aGenotype 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aMutation 2aPlant Diseasesximmunologyxvirology. 2aPlant Proteinsxgeneticsximmunologyxmetabolism. 2aPlants, Genetically Modifiedxgeneticsximmunologyxmetabolismxvirology. 2aPotyvirusximmunologyxpathogenicity. 2aRibonucleoproteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aSolanumxgeneticsximmunologyxmetabolismxvirology. 2aTransformation, Genetic 2aTwo-Hybrid System Techniques 2aViral Nonstructural Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism.1 aRichael, Craig1 aRommens, Caius M.0 tTransgenic research.g2012 Oct., v. 21, no. 5 p.929-938dSpringer-Verlagx0962-88197nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11248-011-9576-9  aDNAL 7aarticle02510naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002300149245014100172300001400313500001500327520114300342592002801485650001801513650001801531650001401549650001101563650001201574650001501586650001401601650001401615650001101629650001501640650001201655650001301667650001701680650001101697650002201708651001201730653001401742653001701756653001401773653001501787653001401802700001901816773008801835856008401923852000902007655001202016IND60582461320221121052224.0190403e201710  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058246132DNAL7 a10.1016/j.flora.2017.09.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGoldberg, Nisse A.10aLife on the leading edge: Phenology and demography of the red mangrove Rhizophora mangle L. at the northern limit of its expanding range  ap. 76-82.  a2019-12-06  aMangroves are expanding northward along the eastern coast of Florida and invading saltmarsh communities along the tributaries and main channels of rivers that flow into the Intracoastal Waterway system. To investigate R. mangle’s demography, reproductive effort and survivorship of offspring were monitored for three years along the Matanzas River, northern Florida. Flowering was delayed, fruit production was year-round and hypocotyl production covered a longer period than for populations further south. If a propagule survived to the recruit stage, the individual was more likely to produce branches. In addition, if the propagule recruited in mud and in the low intertidal zone, then the individual was more likely to survive to the juvenile stage. Those propagules that eventually developed into juveniles had remained within one meter of the parent, had recruited in a vertical position and had larger hypocotyls. Two adults contributed 79% of the propagules that survived to the branched stage. These successful adults become the islands from which the population persists and expands along the leading edge of its distribution.  aPublisher supplied data 3alittoral zone 3asurvival rate 3aflowering 3arivers 3aislands 3ahypocotyls 3ajuveniles 3aphenology 3acoasts 3ademography 3aprogeny 3abranches 3asalt marshes 3aadults 3aRhizophora mangle 3aFlorida 0aDispersal 0aRed mangrove 0amangroves 0aDemography 0aPhenology1 aHeine, John N.0 tFlora.g2017 Oct., v. 235 p.76-82dElsevier GmbHwJournal:jnl51878x0367-25307nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.flora.2017.09.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01893naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002500146245007100171300002000242520070200262592002800964650002200992650001401014650001701028650001801045650002301063650001701086650001401103650003701117650002001154700001901174700002201193700002501215700002401240700002301264773012901287856008201416852000901498655001201507IND60566125820221121231710.0170402e20151231xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056612582DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.5b063312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPakharukova, Vera P.10aStructure of Copper Oxide Species Supported on Monoclinic Zirconia  ap. 28828-28835.  aThe structure of copper oxide species in Cu/ZrO₂ catalysts with monoclinic zirconia as a support was studied.

Oil mixtures of linoleic acid and soybean oil were used as models to investigate the effects of reactor loading (RL = 25, 50, 90%), solvent-to-fatty acid ratio (SFR = 0.15–1.5 mL/g), mixing (0, 300 rpm), temperature (30–245 °C), and reaction time under non-isothermal and isothermal conditions. In addition, water and acetic acid were used as additives to investigate their effect on the reaction. Under favorable reaction conditions of 90% RL, SFR of 0.5 mL/g, and reacted non-isothermally to 245 °C and held for 100 min with stirring, high conversions or yields (87–89%) could be achieved when using SODDs having different total fatty acid content (59.37–77.42 wt%). The effect of unsaponifiable matter in significant quantities and some simple strategies to overcome possible limitations in the use of such feedstock were also looked into.

These degradation schemes have been implemented in the meteorological/tracer transport model CATT-BRAMS used in the present case as pseudo one-dimensional model with chemistry of CH₄, CO, HOₓ, NOₓ, NOy and Oₓ. They include the main possible reactions of the intermediate brominated peroxy radicals RO₂ (with R = CH₂Br, CHBr₂ and CBr₃) for which the most likely reaction pathways with HO₂ have been found using ab initio computational calculations. The full degradation schemes have been run for two well-defined realistic scenarios, “clean” atmosphere and “moderately” NOy-polluted atmosphere, as representative of a tropical coastal region where these VSLS natural emissions are expected to be important. The Henry’s law constants of the brominated organics products have been estimated by using the Bond Contribution Method (BCM; Meylan and Howard, 1991) or the Molecular Connectivity Index (MCI; Nirmalakhandan and Speece, 1988). Using these constants, the least soluble species formed from the VSLS degradation are found to be CBr₂O, CHBrO, CBr₃O₂NO₂, CHBr₂O₂NO₂, BrO, BrONO₂ and HOBr, which leads those to be potentially transported into the tropical tropopause layer (TTL) in case of deep convection and contribute to stratospheric bromine additionally to the original substances. For bromoform and dibromomethane degradation, the moderate NOy pollution increases the production of the least soluble species and thus approximately doubles the bromine quantity potentially able to reach the TTL (from 22.5% to 43% for CHBr₃ and from 8.8% to 20.2% for CH₂Br₂). The influence of the reactions of the RO₂ radicals with HO₂, CH₃O₂ and NO₂ on the nature and abundance of the stable intermediate and end-products has been tested for CHBr₃ degradation. As a result, the reactions of the RO₂ radicals with NO₂ have no impact. Taking into account the reaction between RO₂ and CH₃O₂ and modifying the branching ratios of the reaction between RO₂ and HO₂ lead to a small impact on the bromoform degradation by slightly decreasing (by 10%) the bromine quantity potentially able to reach the TTL. As a final point, in contrast to CHBr₃, CH₂Br₂ degradation produces negligible quantities of organics species and the effects of pollution increase only the inorganic species production. By taking into account the results of these tests, new simplified degradation schemes for CHBr₃ and CH₂Br₂ are proposed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aatmospheric chemistry 3abromine 3achemical reactions 3aemissions 3afree radicals 3amethane 3amodels 3anitrogen dioxide 3apollution 3astratosphere 3atropopause1 aCatoire, V.1 aPoulet, G.1 aMarécal, V.1 aPirre, M.1 aLouis, F.1 aCanneaux, S.1 aJosse, B.0 tAtmospheric environment.g2012 Nov., v. 59 p.514-532dElsevier Ltdx1352-23107nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.atmosenv.2012.05.0263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02983naa a2200673 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245011600168300001500284520117700299592002801476650002501504650003101529650002201560650001901582650001001601650001901611650001701630650002001647650002401667650002101691650001601712653000901728653000901737653001001746653000901756653001901765653000901784653001001793653001301803653000901816653000801825653000801833653001001841653001001851653000801861653000801869653001001877653001101887653000801898653000701906653001001913653000901923653000901932700001701941700001901958700001901977700002001996700002002016700005902036773011102095856008202206852000902288655001202297IND60625882120221121031435.0190516e201902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062588212DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jff.2018.12.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChang, Chao-Yuan10aCluster of differentiation 14 and toll-like receptor 4 are involved in the anti-inflammatory effects of tyrosol  ap. 93-104.  aWe investigated effects of tyrosol on upstream pathway regulating lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammatory response, including cluster of differentiation 14 (CD14)-mediated LPS–macrophage binding, toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)/myeloid differentiation factor 2 (MD2) expression and subsequent myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88 (MyD88) and TIR-domain-containing adapter-inducing interferon-β (TRIF) recruitments. Flow cytometry revealed that, compared with LPS-treated RAW264.7 cells (LPS group), those treated with LPS and tyrosol (1.2 mM) [LPS+T(1.2) group] demonstrated lower LPS–macrophage binding and membrane-bound CD14 (mCD14) and TLR4/MD2 expression (all p < 0.05). Immunoprecipitation/immunoblotting assay revealed lower MyD88 and TRIF concentrations in the LPS+T(1.2) group than in the LPS group (both p < 0.05). Soluble CD14 concentration was higher in the LPS+T(1.2) group than in the LPS group (p = 0.013); protease inhibition counteracted this effect. Thus, tyrosol inhibits LPS–macrophage binding, mCD14 and TLR4/MD2 expression, and MyD88 and TRIF recruitment, all possibly by enhancing protease-mediated mCD14 cleavage.  aPublisher supplied data 3aToll-like receptor 4 3aanti-inflammatory activity 3aenzyme inhibition 3aflow cytometry 3agenes 3aimmunoblotting 3ainflammation 3ainterferon-beta 3alipopolysaccharides 3aprecipitin tests 3aproteinases 0aCD14 0aTLR4 0aMyD88 0aTRIF 0aRAW264.7 cells 0aCD14 0aELISA 0aFITC-LPS 0aIL-6 0aLBP 0aLPS 0aMAPKs 0amCD14 0aMD2 0aMFI 0aMyD88 0aNF-κB 0aPBS 0aPI 0asCD14 0aTRIF 0aTLR41 aHuang, I-Tao1 aShih, Hung-Jen1 aChang, Ya-Ying1 aKao, Ming-Chang1 aShih, Ping-Chen1 aHuang, Chun-Jen1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1006-67620 tJournal of functional foods.g2019 Feb., v. 53 p.93-104dElsevier LtdwJournal:J000000142x1756-46467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jff.2018.12.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03222naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001900149245013000168300001400298520197300312592002802285650001702313650001602330650001302346650001402359650001702373650001602390650001002406650001602416650001002432653001502442653001802457653001102475653003302486653001402519653002902533700002702562700002602589773009202615856008402707852000902791655001202800IND60582461420221121041519.0190403e201711  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058246142DNAL7 a10.1016/j.flora.2017.09.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPaulů, Andrea10aAre there systematic differences in germination between rare and common species? A case study from central European mountains  ap. 15-24.  aUnderstanding the factors responsible for species rarity is key for designing effective management strategies aimed at long-term conservation of species. Most such studies investigate plant size, competitive vigour or habitat requirements, but studies that explore more complex characteristics of species directly related to different stages of the plant life cycle are much less common. Germination is the most critical stage in the life cycle of many plants and is the primary source of variation in the regeneration niche. However, only a few authors have studied differences in germination requirements between common and rare congeners, and none have studied these requirements for large sets of species.The aim of this study was to compare seed mass, germination requirements and proportions of germinated seeds of rare and common congeners across a large set of species. We analysed seed mass, proportions of germinated seeds in specific conditions and total proportions of germinated seeds of 18 congeneric pairs of rare and common plant species. We tested different lengths of cold stratification, constant or alternating temperatures, and different light conditions.Seed mass of rare and common congeners was not significantly different. The results indicated that after cold stratification, the proportions of germinated seeds were higher in rare than in common species. In common species, the proportions of germinated seeds were significantly higher during cold stratification than those of rare species. Rare species had higher proportions of germinated seeds than those of their common congeners, and total proportions of germinated seeds were influenced by seed mass and species rarity. Rare species were apparently well adapted to local conditions in the mountains and the inability to germinate was clearly not a cause for their rarity. The study provides unique data on proportions of germinated seeds over a wide spectrum of species and conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase studies 3agermination 3ahabitats 3amountains 3arare species 3aseed weight 3aseeds 3atemperature 3avigor 0aCommonness 0aKrkonoše Mts 0aRarity 0aReproduction characteristics 0aSeed size 0aTemperature requirements1 aHarčariková, Ludmila1 aMünzbergová, Zuzana0 tFlora.g2017 Nov., v. 236-237 p.15-24dElsevier GmbHwJournal:jnl51878x0367-25307nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.flora.2017.09.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02044naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001600148245008600164300001400250520065100264592002800915650002300943650002300966650002400989650003801013650003501051650002001086650001801106650001501124650001501139653003401154653002901188653002601217653003901243653003601282653001801318653002701336653002001363700001401383700001601397773009401413856008201507852000901589655001201598IND60560349020221121044829.0170105e201702  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056034902DNAL7 a10.1016/j.trac.2016.12.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Zhen10aImmunochemical detection of emerging organic contaminants in environmental waters  ap. 49-57.  aImmunochemical techniques exhibit great advantages of high efficiency, rapidness, reliability and low cost compared to instrumental methods for monitoring emerging organic contaminants (EOCs) in aquatic environments.

The plasma levels of coagulation factors including plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI)-1 and factor VII (FVII); anticoagulation factors including antithrombin-III (AT-III) and protein C in diabetic patients were determined prior to intervention and 8 weeks after intervention. Plasma lipid profiles and inflammatory factors were also measured. AX supplements increased plasma AX levels and decreased FPG and HbA1c levels. H-AX intake lowered changes in plasma triglyceride, total cholesterol and LDL levels. AX supplements lowered changes in plasma IL-6 and TNF-alpha levels. H-AX decreased changes in plasma FVII and PAI-1levels. AX intake also led to lower changes in plasma vWF level and higher changes in AT-III level.

Several independent studies have been previously conducted to investigate the association between the single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) 606G >C (rs3729753) in the coding region of NKX2.5 and congenital heart disease (CHD). However, the results of these studies have been inconsistent. Therefore, the present study aimed to reveal the relationship between NKX2.5 SNP 606G >C and the risk of CHD as possible in the Chinese population through meta-analysis. After retrieving related articles in PubMed, MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of science, Cochrane, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Wanfang DATA, and VIP database until August 2021, a total of eight studies were included in the present meta-analysis. The qualified research data were then merged into allele, dominant, recessive, heterozygous, homozygous, and additive models. Overall results of the current meta-analysis showed that 606G >C was not associated with CHD of the Chinese population in any model. In addition, subgroup analysis based on CHD type gave the same negative result. Results of sensitivity analysis showed that there was no significant correlation after the deletion of each study. Furthermore, it was noted that the results were negative and the heterogeneity was not significant. In conclusion, it was evident that NKX2-5 SNP 606G >C may not lead to the risk of CHD in Chinese population.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalleles 3adatabases 3agrowth and development 3aheart diseases 3aheterozygosity 3ahomozygosity 3ameta-analysis 3amodels 3arisk 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 3atranscription factors 0acongenital heart disease 0aNKX2.5 0aSNP 0ameta-analysis 0acase–control study 0aCRD420201851091 aLi, Tianjiao1 aWu, Yuqing1 aWang, Xi1 aWang, Mingyuan1 aWang, Xin1 aFang, Xiaoling0 tOpen life sciences.g2022 May 12, v. 17, no. 1 p.473-482dDe GruyterwJournal:23145x2391-54127nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1515/biol-2022-00583Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02224naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001800146245016700164300002000331520101000351592002801361650001301389650000901402650001401411650002301425650001601448700001801464700002901482700001801511700001901529700002201548700002301570700002001593700001701613773012901630856008201759852000901841655001201850IND60566126020221122002602.0170402e20151231xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056612602DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.5b072742doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee, Chi-Hung10aComplex Magnetic Phases in Nanosized Core@Shell Prussian Blue Analogue Cubes: Rb0.48Co[Fe(CN)6]0.75[(H2O)6]0.25·0.34H2O@K0.36Ni[Cr(CN)6]0.74[(H2O)6]0.26·0.11H2O  ap. 29138-29147.  aDifferent magnetic phases have been identified in nanosized core/shell Prussian blue analogue (PBA) cubes, with a 250 nm Rb–Co–Fe phase (Rb₀.₄₈Co[Fe(CN)₆]₀.₇₅[(H₂O)₆]₀.₂₅·0.34H₂O) in the core coated by a 45 nm K–Ni–Cr phase (K₀.₃₆Ni[Cr(CN)₆]₀.₇₄[(H₂O)₆]₀.₂₆·0.11H₂O) on the shell. Three separate characteristic temperatures at 86, 69, and 67 K are associated with magnetic phases in the K–Ni–Cr shell. Two magnetic exchange paths are identified. One propagates along the three crystallographic axis directions. The other propagates along the [110] crystallographic direction for the associated Ni–Ni interactions, but not for Cr–Cr interactions. The severe Cr deficiency and the appearance of direct Ni–Ni exchange are used to understand the appearance of two separate transitions associated with magnetic ordering. A weak moment develops in the core at low temperature, corresponding to separate ordering of the Co–Fe PBA network.  aPublisher supplied data 3achromium 3airon 3amagnetism 3aphysical chemistry 3atemperature1 aWu, Chun-Ming1 aBatsaikhan, Erdembayalag1 aLi, Hsiao-Chi1 aLi, Carissa H.1 aPeprah, Marcus K.1 aTalham, Daniel R.,1 aMeisel, Mark W.1 aLi, Wenxian,0 tThe Journal of Physical Chemistry C.g2015 Dec. 31, v. 119, no. 52 p.29138-29147dAmerican Chemical Societyx1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.jpcc.5b072743Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02414naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245008400167300001600251520133300267592002801600650001401628650001001642650001901652650001001671650001601681650002201697650001101719650001501730650005001745700002301795700002001818700002301838773010101861856008101962852000902043655001202052IND60085727720221119035310.0141101e20111031xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008572772DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aca.2011.07.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aŽuperl, Špela10aExperimental determination and prediction of bilitranslocase transport activity  ap. 322-333.  aThe transport activity of a membrane protein, bilitranslocase (T.C. # 2.A.65.1.1), which acts as a transporter of bilirubin from blood to liver cells, was experimentally determined for a large set of various endogenous compounds, drugs, purine and pyrimidine derivatives. On these grounds, the structure–activity models were developed following the OECD principles of QSAR models and their predictive ability for new chemicals was evaluated. The applicability domain of the models was estimated by Euclidean distances criteria according to the applied modeling method. The selection of the most influential structural variables was an important stage in the adopted modeling methodology. The interpretation of selected variables was performed in order to get an insight into the mechanism of transport through the cell membrane via bilitranslocase. Validation of the optimized models was performed by a previously determined validation set. The classification model was build to separate active from inactive compounds. The resulting accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity were 0.73, 0.89, and 0.64, respectively. Only active compounds were used to develop a predictive model for bilitranslocase inhibition constants.

O3-NaCrO₂ is a promising cathode material for SIBs due to its stable structure and low-cost raw materials. In this paper, we design and synthesize a powder consisting of submicrometer-sized O3-NaCrO₂ spheres (s-NaCrO₂) self-assembled with nanoflakes, which exhibits faster ion migration ability and strong structure robustness. The galvanostatic intermittent titration technique test reveals the higher apparent Na⁺ diffusion coefficient of s-NaCrO₂ when compared with a normal NaCrO₂ powder with an irregular particle morphology. The s-NaCrO₂ shows impressive electrochemical properties with a capacity of 90 mAh g–¹ at 50 C. In addition, outstanding cycling stability is shown when tested at 20 C, where a capacity of 90 mAh g–¹ is maintained with a retention of 87% after 1500 cycles. Also, s-NaCrO₂ is advantageous at high (50 °C) and low (−10 °C) temperatures. The full cells assembled employing Sb/C as the anode exhibit good rate capability with 85 mAh g–¹ obtained at 50 C.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanodes 3acathodes 3adiffusivity 3aelectrochemistry 3aenergy 3asodium 3atitration 0asodium chromium oxide 0asubmicrospheres 0along cycle life 0asodium-ion battery 0afull cell1 aChen, Fei1 aHe, Xiao-dong1 aZhang, Li-ming1 aChen, Fang1 aWang, Jun-ru1 aDong, Jie-min1 aChen, Chun-hua1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9589-63290 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2021 Mar. 04, v. 13, no. 10 p.12203-12210dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.0c230693Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02948naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001800152245008700170300001400257500001500271520146900286592002801755650001901783650001501802650001401817650005201831650001701883650002901900650001201929650001901941650001301960650002201973650000801995650001202003650001402015650002902029653002402058653002702082653002402109653002302133700001802156700002502174700001702199700001502216700002102231773009502252856008602347852000902433655001202442IND60560349320221121044826.0170606e201703  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056034932DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jviromet.2016.12.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGreijer, A.E.10aQuantitative multi-target RNA profiling in Epstein-Barr virus infected tumor cells  ap. 24-33.  a2019-12-06  aEpstein-Barr virus (EBV) is etiologically linked to multiple acute, chronic and malignant diseases. Detection of EBV-RNA transcripts in tissues or biofluids besides EBV-DNA can help in diagnosing EBV related syndromes. Sensitive EBV transcription profiling yields new insights on its pathogenic role and may be useful for monitoring virus targeted therapy. Here we describe a multi-gene quantitative RT-PCR profiling method that simultaneously detects a broad spectrum (n=16) of crucial latent and lytic EBV transcripts. These transcripts include (but are not restricted to), EBNA1, EBNA2, LMP1, LMP2, BARTs, EBER1, BARF1 and ZEBRA, Rta, BGLF4 (PK), BXLF1 (TK) and BFRF3 (VCAp18) all of which have been implicated in EBV-driven oncogenesis and viral replication. With this method we determine the amount of RNA copies per infected (tumor) cell in bulk populations of various origin. While we confirm the expected RNA profiles within classic EBV latency programs, this sensitive quantitative approach revealed the presence of rare cells undergoing lytic replication. Inducing lytic replication in EBV tumor cells supports apoptosis and is considered as therapeutic approach to treat EBV-driven malignancies. This sensitive multi-primed quantitative RT-PCR approach can provide broader understanding of transcriptional activity in latent and lytic EBV infection and is suitable for monitoring virus-specific therapy responses in patients with EBV associated cancers.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarcinogenesis 3amonitoring 3aneoplasms 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3atherapeutics 3atranscription (genetics) 3aviruses 3aneoplasm cells 3apatients 3avirus replication 3aRNA 3atissues 3aapoptosis 3aHuman gammaherpesvirus 4 0aHuman herpesvirus 4 0aRNA expression profile 0aQuantitative RT-PCR 0aEpstein-Barr virus1 aRamayanti, O.1 aVerkuijlen, S.A.W.M.1 aNovalić, Z.1 aJuwana, H.1 aMiddeldorp, J.M.0 tJournal of virological methods.g2017 Mar., v. 241 p.24-33dElsevier B.V.x0166-09347nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jviromet.2016.12.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02389naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245010100168300001600269520125900285592002801544650002301572650001701595650001001612650001401622650002201636650002201658650001601680650001301696650003301709650002801742700001601770700001901786700001901805773010101824856008101925852000902006655001202015IND60085727820221119035255.0141101e20111031xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008572782DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aca.2011.07.0432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDégardin, Klara10aDetection and chemical profiling of medicine counterfeits by Raman spectroscopy and chemometrics  ap. 334-341.  aRaman spectroscopy combined with chemometrics has recently become a widespread technique for the analysis of pharmaceutical solid forms. The application presented in this paper is the investigation of counterfeit medicines. This increasingly serious issue involves networks that are an integral part of industrialized organized crime. Efficient analytical tools are consequently required to fight against it. Quick and reliable authentication means are needed to allow the deployment of measures from the company and the authorities. For this purpose a method in two steps has been implemented here. The first step enables the identification of pharmaceutical tablets and capsules and the detection of their counterfeits. A nonlinear classification method, the Support Vector Machines (SVM), is computed together with a correlation with the database and the detection of Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient (API) peaks in the suspect product. If a counterfeit is detected, the second step allows its chemical profiling among former counterfeits in a forensic intelligence perspective. For this second step a classification based on Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and correlation distance measurements is applied to the Raman spectra of the counterfeits.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRaman spectroscopy 3achemometrics 3acrime 3adatabases 3aforensic sciences 3aindustrialization 3aingredients 3amedicine 3aprincipal component analysis 3asupport vector machines1 aRoggo, Yves1 aBeen, Frederic1 aMargot, Pierre0 tAnalytica chimica acta.g2011 Oct. 31, v. 705, no. 1-2 p.334-341dElsevier B.V.x0003-26707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aca.2011.07.0433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01619naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001600155245010300171300001600274520072800290592002801018650002401046650001601070650001601086700001701102700001401119773007501133856008901208990002301297852000901320655001201329IND60096044020221119092819.0141104e201312  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009604402DNAL7 a10.1016/j.compositesb.2013.06.0282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSun, Jiabin10aAccurate symplectic space solutions for thermal buckling of functionally graded cylindrical shells  ap. 208-214.  aThis paper derives new analytical solutions for thermal bifurcation buckling of cylindrical shells made of functionally graded materials (FGMs) with temperature-dependent material properties. The Donnell’s shell theory is adopted and a symplectic solution methodology is established through the Hamiltonian variational principle. The fundamental buckling problem is then converted into the solving for the symplectic eigenvalues and eigenvectors. The solutions reveal that boundary conditions and temperature-dependent FGM properties have significant influence on thermal buckling behavior.

Compared to modifications at the imide position of a perylene diimide (PDI), few studies have explored bay substitution of chiral PDIs and their self-assemblies into 1D nanomaterials. Herein, we describe the synthesis of three bay-substituted PDIs and explore the effects of bay substitution on supramolecular chirality by examining circular dichroism spectra and the optoelectronic performance of chiral PDI nanomaterials in phototransistors. Among the three fabricated self-assemblies, nanomaterials based on (R)-CN-CPDI-Ph exhibited the highest electron mobility of 0.17 cm² V–¹ s–¹, a low threshold voltage of −1 V, and enhanced optoelectronic performance. For example, the photoresponsivity and external quantum efficiency of (R)-CN-CPDI-Ph assemblies were 4-fold higher than those of (R)-2Br-CPDI-Ph and (R)-2F-CPDI-Ph. All three nanomaterials exhibited fast switching speeds compared with previously reported N-substituted PDIs, suggesting that bay substitution can be an effective means of achieving rapid photoswitching. A comprehensive study using density functional theory calculations and crystal analyses revealed that the enhanced optoelectronic performance of (R)-CN-CPDI-Ph nanomaterials is related to the substitution of CN at the bay position of PDI. This minor change provides simultaneous improvements in electron injectability and structural order. Our findings demonstrate that bay substitution can significantly impact the self-assembly, supramolecular chirality, and optoelectronic properties of PDI nanomaterials.  aPublisher supplied data 3acircular dichroism spectroscopy 3adensity functional theory 3aelectric potential difference 3aoptical isomerism 0asupramolecular chirality 0abay substitution 0aphototransistors 0aperylene diimides 0ananomaterials1 aAhn, Jaeyong1 aLee, Jeong Hyeon1 aKim, Jin Chul1 aOhtsu, Hiroyoshi1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2911-31511 aChoi, Wanuk1 aSong, In-ho,1 aKwak, Sang Kyu1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0332-15341 aOh, Joon Hak1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0481-60690 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2021 Mar. 05, v. 13, no. 10 p.12278-12285dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.0c231383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02114naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245008300164300001600247520120200263592002801465650002001493650001801513650001101531650001001542650002801552700002101580700002001601773010101621856008101722852000901803655001201812IND60085728020221119035307.0141101e20111031xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008572802DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aca.2011.04.0252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPostma, G.J.10aOpening the kernel of kernel partial least squares and support vector machines  ap. 123-134.  aKernel partial least squares (KPLS) and support vector regression (SVR) have become popular techniques for regression of complex non-linear data sets. The modeling is performed by mapping the data in a higher dimensional feature space through the kernel transformation. The disadvantage of such a transformation is, however, that information about the contribution of the original variables in the regression is lost. In this paper we introduce a method which can retrieve and visualize the contribution of the variables to the regression model and the way the variables contribute to the regression of complex data sets. The method is based on the visualization of trajectories using so-called pseudo samples representing the original variables in the data. We test and illustrate the proposed method to several synthetic and real benchmark data sets. The results show that for linear and non-linear regression models the important variables were identified with corresponding linear or non-linear trajectories. The results were verified by comparing with ordinary PLS regression and by selecting those variables which were indicated as important and rebuilding a model with only those variables.  aPublisher supplied data 3adata collection 3aleast squares 3amodels 3aseeds 3asupport vector machines1 aKrooshof, P.W.T.1 aBuydens, L.M.C.0 tAnalytica chimica acta.g2011 Oct. 31, v. 705, no. 1-2 p.123-134dElsevier B.V.x0003-26707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aca.2011.04.0253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02669naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001500155245011000170300001400280520169400294592002801988650002802016650001902044650001102063650001302074700001502087700001202102700002002114700001502134773007302149856008902222990002302311852000902334655001202343IND60096044220221119092913.0141104e201312  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009604422DNAL7 a10.1016/j.compositesb.2013.05.0522doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTang, C.Y.10aMulti-level finite element analysis for progressive damage behavior of HA/PEEK composite porous structure  ap. 22-30.  aA three-dimensional multi-level finite element (FE) modeling approach has been developed to simulate mechanical response and progressive damage behavior of hydroxyapatite/polyetheretherketone (HA/PEEK) porous structures separately under tensile and compressive loadings. Moreover, the densification of the HA/PEEK porous structures under compressive loading was also simulated. Nonlinear constitutive relations of the HA/PEEK composites coupled with both matrix and interfacial debonding damage were determined by using a micro-level FE unit cell model. A Kelvin open-cell model composed of solid beams was used for constructing a meso-level FE model, which was the basic unit for building the porous structure. The relative density of the meso-level model was varied for mimicking different porosity levels. For simulating the progressive damage behavior of the porous structure from initiation to failure, a strain invariant failure criterion for the beams was incorporated into the meso-level FE model. A beam-to-beam self-contact model was adopted to describe the contact behaviors of the beam elements. Six case examples were used for investigating the effects of considering the micro-level composite damage behavior and failure criterion of the beam elements on the mechanical response of the porous structures separately under tensile and compressive loadings. With the proposed method considering both composite damage and beam failure, the predicted tensile and compressive stress–strain responses of the porous structure, including elastic, plateau and densification characteristics under compressive loading, agreed well with the related experimental data in open literature.  aPublisher supplied data 3afinite element analysis 3ahydroxyapatite 3amodels 3aporosity1 aTsui, C.P.1 aLin, W.1 aUskokovic, P.S.1 aWang, Z.W.0 tComposites.g2013 Dec., v. 55 p.22-30dElsevier Ltdx1359-83687nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.compositesb.2013.05.0523Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02952naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245010800167300001600275520163900291592002801930650002001958650001701978650002401995650001102019650002402030650001202054650002102066650001102087651001602098653003002114653002002144653002702164653002102191653003502212653002502247700001502272700001902287700001902306773009902325856008502424852000902509655001202518IND60730124220221120185211.0220103e20210401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073012422DNAL7 a10.1016/j.wasman.2021.02.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHo Park, Man10aIncorporating interaction terms in multivariate linear regression for post-event flood waste estimation  ap. 377-384.  aMultivariate linear regression methodology has been conceived as a viable technique in flood waste estimation. The fundamental assumption of the conventional flood waste model, independence between input variables, may not work in reality. As an alternative, we evaluated the effectiveness of including interaction terms in flood waste modeling. The secondary objectives include to suggest the strategy in flood waste mitigation and to explore a plausible explanation to the modeling results. In the scheme of model development and assessment, ninety flood cases in South Korea were statistically analyzed. Input variables for regression analysis were selected from available datasets in the national disaster information system and the selected variables were flood damage variables used to quantify the amount of flood waste. According to the results, incorporating the interaction terms improved the estimation accuracy of the model. The single-variable sensitivity analysis revealed that mitigating damage to rivers and croplands would most efficiently reduce potential flood waste generation. The interaction terms appeared to compensate for the over/underestimated waste amounts by single terms, and they explained the nonlinear response of waste generation. Observations made throughout the field survey revealed that the nonlinear and interactive pattern of flood waste generation corresponded to the results from the regression analysis. In a practical aspect, incorporating the interaction terms would be an effective method to enhance the flood waste estimation model without costly works for further variables exploration.  aPublisher supplied data 3adata collection 3aflood damage 3ainformation systems 3amodels 3aregression analysis 3asurveys 3awaste management 3awastes 3aSouth Korea 0aDisaster waste management 0aField surveying 0aFlood waste estimation 0aInteraction term 0aMultivariate linear regression 0aSensitivity analysis1 aJu, Munsol1 aJeong, Sangjae1 aYoung Kim, Jae0 tWaste management.g2021 Apr. 01, v. 124 p.377-384dElsevier LtdwJournal:6325x0956-053X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2021.02.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02907naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002600144245010300170300001600273520129400289592002801583650001901611650001901630650001901649650002001668650002201688650001901710650002201729650001001751650001601761650001401777650001801791650001101809650001801820650001801838650001701856653002501873653002501898653002001923700001901943700001601962700001601978700001601994700001802010700001402028700001802042700002502060700002502085700001902110700001602129773010802145856007902253852000902332655001202341IND60776999320221123033731.0220512e20220401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077699932DNAL7 a10.2478/aoas-2021-00492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKhan, Muhammad Zahoor10aMining for the association of bovine mastitis linked genes to pathological signatures and pathways  ap. 583-591.  aBackground: Bovine mastitis is a common infectious disease with a serious threat to the dairy industry and public health. Mastitis is a polygenetic trait under the control of many genes. In the current study, our research attempted to address the role of mastitis-associated genes in various signalings including parasitic, viral, cancer and fungal diseases by using online bioinformatics software. Methods: We selected mastitis-associated genes from already published data and using online bioinformatics tools including DAVID and String classified the pathological role of relevant genes. A Venn diagram was used to show the status of overlapping genes among different biological function processes. Result: This study revealed that the genes gathered in published resources of mastitis were significantly correlated with influenza A, chagas disease, leishmaniasis, toxoplasmosis, tuberculosis, cancer signaling, hepatitis B, type I & II diabetes mellitus and prion diseases biological pathways. Based on our findings, we concluded that mastitis-linked genes could be used as markers for many other diseases. Moreover, the bioinformatics tools applied in the current study might be helpful in screening the genes involved in one disease and their association with other diseases as well.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChagas disease 3aanimal science 3abioinformatics 3abovine mastitis 3acomputer software 3adairy industry 3adiabetes mellitus 3afungi 3ahepatitis B 3ainfluenza 3aleishmaniasis 3aprions 3apublic health 3atoxoplasmosis 3atuberculosis 0abioinformatics tools 0abiological signaling 0agenetic markers1 aBelhan, Saadet1 aCetin, Nebi1 aAyan, Adnan1 aKhan, Adnan1 aAhmad, Irshad1 aMa, Yulin1 aXiao, Jianxin1 aKhan, Jamal Muhammad1 aShah, Muhammad Kamal1 aUllah, Shakeeb1 aCao, Zhijun0 tAnnals of animal science.g2022 Apr. 01, v. 22, no. 2 p.583-591dSciendowJournal:2194x2300-87337nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2478/aoas-2021-00493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03890naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001200152245009700164300001400261520232100275592002802596650001602624650001102640650000902651650002202660650002102682650002402703650002202727650002902749650000902778650001702787650001102804650001502815650003302830650001102863651001002874653000802884653004902892653003002941653003502971653003403006700001603040700001603056700001903072700001903091700001303110700001703123700001603140773009603156856008703252852000903339655001203348IND60573014120221123013201.0180912e20171001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057301412DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apenergy.2017.06.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Han10aModelling of AQI related to building space heating energy demand based on big data analytics  ap. 57-71.  aAccording to the annual air quality report released by the Ministry of Environmental Protection of China, the cities that requiring heating reported an average of 168.3days that could not reach the air quality standard, which was 59.8% higher than warm cities that did not require heating in 2014. Coal-fired energy conversion for building space heating can generate a large amount of haze pollutions during the winter. More seriously, the year-by-year data of district heating capacity increases with an average growth rate of 5.59% published in the China Statistical Yearbook, which means more and more heating associated pollutants will emit into the atmosphere and result in the worse and worse environment quality predictability in the further without taking any effective measure. In this context, considering the factors of energy, environment and human health simultaneously, this paper aimed to develop an air quality index (AQI) associated with energy conversion for building space heating model to guide the energy-saving measures on heating. Principal component analysis and grey relation projection evaluation theory approaches were used to preprocess the historical AQI data. Moreover, a simplified two-dimensionality heating capacity model based on EnergyPlus simulation results was introduced to expand the application range of the AQI-Heating (A-H) model. The A-H model included three components, which were the direct pollutant emission, regenerated pollutant emission and urban self-purifying capacity. Four pollutants related input coefficients including the direct emission factor A, the urban maximum purifying capacity a, the attenuation coefficient b and the regenerated coefficient ξ were solved by homemade code based on Matlab software according to a 10-year observed data (2003–2015). The performance of A-H model was compared with the actual values (data from 2015 to 2016) and the results of conventional linear and nonlinear regression techniques, in terms of the index of mean absolute error (MAE), mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), root-mean-squared error (RMSE) and index of agreement (IA). All performance metrics proved that the A-H model was accurate enough (e.g. IA=0.983) to analyze the relationship between the AQI and the energy conversion for building space heating.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair quality 3acities 3acoal 3acomputer software 3aemissions factor 3aenergy conservation 3aenergy conversion 3aenvironmental protection 3aheat 3ahuman health 3amodels 3apollutants 3aprincipal component analysis 3awinter 3aChina 0aAQI 0aEnergy conversion for building space heating 0aDirect pollutant emission 0aRegenerated pollutant emission 0aUrban self-purifying capacity1 aYou, Shijun1 aZhang, Huan1 aZheng, Wandong1 aZheng, Xuejing1 aJia, Jie1 aYe, Tianzhen1 aZou, Lanjun0 tApplied energy.g2017 Oct. 01, v. 203 p.57-71dElsevier LtdwJournal:11876x0306-26197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2017.06.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03406naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001900153245013400172506010400306506007600410520191600486592002802402506003702430650001702467650001202484650001902496650002002515650002902535650001102564650001102575650001102586650001402597650001902611650002802630653001902658653001202677653001702689653001402706653001502720700002202735773010602757856008802863852000902951655001202960IND60762390520221207112907.0220523e202203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076239052DNAL7 a10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2022.1024662doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBaste, Ivar A.10aTackling the climate, biodiversity and pollution emergencies by making peace with nature 50 years after the Stockholm Conference  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aToday’s increasingly unequal and resource intensive development model degrades and surpasses Earth’s finite capacity to sustain human well-being. Society must restore this capacity and adapt to it without surrendering hard won development gains while also honoring the rightful aspirations of poorer nations and people to enjoy better living standards, according to the UNEP report “Making Peace with Nature”. This article presents findings from the report and reflections on how to take advantage of the 50 years of experience gained since the Stockholm Conference on the Human Environment. The interconnected environmental emergencies of climate change, loss of biodiversity and pollution need to be addressed together. International scientific assessments are providing the knowledge base for informed evidence-based decision-making, but none of the internationally agreed environmentally targets for climate and biodiversity have been met and the situation is becoming more dire with each passing year. Unless these issues are addressed in the next 5–10 years none of the 2030 sustainable development goals will be achieved. Human knowledge, ingenuity, technology and cooperation need to be mobilized in such an effort. The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development with its 17 Sustainable Development Goals provides a blueprint for the transformation. The international environmental governance structure needs to facilitate a system-wide cross-sectoral transformation of humankind's relationship with nature. Transformed economic, financial and productive systems can lead and power the shift to sustainability. Major shifts in investment and regulation are key to just and informed transformations that overcome inertia and opposition from vested interests. Government actions at all levels are needed together with strengthened actions by all actors in society and the next decade is critical.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abiodiversity 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3adecision making 3aenvironmental governance 3ahumans 3amodels 3apeople 3apollution 3asocial welfare 3asustainable development 0aScience-policy 0aClimate 0aBiodiversity 0aPollution 0aGovernance1 aWatson, Robert T.0 tGlobal environmental change.g2022 Mar., v. 73 p.102466-dElsevier LtdwJournal:2063x0959-37807nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2022.1024663Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03585naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002000149245012900169300001400298520209800312592002802410650001502438650001902453650002202472650002002494650000902514650002602523650000902549650002102558650001102579650001202590650001602602650001502618650000902633650002002642650001302662650001202675651001002687653003102697653002902728653003302757653002002790653003002810700002002840700001902860773010702879856008402986852000903070655001203079IND60541090720221122212507.0190318e201409  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054109072DNAL7 a10.1016/j.still.2014.04.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuang, Lai-Ming10aLong-term paddy cultivation significantly alters topsoil phosphorus transformation and degrades phosphorus sorption capacity  ap. 32-41.  aInformation on the dynamics of phosphorus (P) fraction and sorption–desorption characteristics of paddy soils with long cultivation history is essential to improve our understanding of P transformation and transport in agro-ecosystems and critical for sustainable and environment-friendly soil management. We investigated changes in P fraction and sorption–desorption characteristics in topsoils from two contrasting paddy chronosequences developed on calcareous marine sediments at Cixi and acidic quaternary red clays at Jinxian, respectively, in subtropical China. Both chronosequences showed similar patterns and pedogenetic trends of their topsoil P status. Total P (PT) and various P fractions (calcium-associated P (PCa), organic P (Po), non-occluded and occluded P) accumulated to a maximum after 50-yrs and 150-yrs of cultivation, respectively, at Cixi and Jinxian due to P addition, consistent with the prior agronomic field studies on decadal time scales. However, rapid decrease of PT occurred in the older paddy soils at both sites, despite the continuous P additions, which we attributed to the decline of P sorption capacity since P sorbents (CaCO3, Fe- and Al-oxides, and clay) rapidly decreased. Compared with Walker and Syers’ model of gradual P depletion and decreasing bioavailabity in natural ecosystems, our results show that long-term paddy cultivation alters both the rate and trajectory of topsoil P transformations during agro-ecosystem development. The ability of the topsoil to sorb added P decreased with paddy cultivation history in both chronosequences, due to the decline in the maximum P sorption capacity (Smax); whereas the P release potential increased as a result of paddy cultivation at both sites, as indicated by the higher degree of P saturation (DPS) and greater P desorbability in the paddy soils than the uncultivated soils. Our study suggests that after long-term cultivation paddy soils are getting degraded by lowering their P holding capacity so may enhance the P release potential and lead to increasing environmental risk through P loss.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorbents 3aagroecosystems 3acalcium carbonate 3achronosequences 3aclay 3afield experimentation 3airon 3amarine sediments 3amodels 3apaddies 3apaddy soils 3aphosphorus 3arisk 3asoil management 3asorption 3atopsoil 3aChina 0aPhosphorus biogeochemistry 0aPhosphorus fractionation 0aPhosphorus sorption capacity 0aPhosphorus loss 0aPaddy soil chronosequence1 aThompson, Aaron1 aZhang, Gan-Lin0 tSoil & tillage research.g2014 Sept., v. 142 p.32-41dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl32961x0167-19877nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.still.2014.04.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02113naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001500142245010400157300002000261520097800281592002801259650001301287650001001300650001901310650001101329650001301340650001101353650001601364650001801380700001801398700001801416700001201434700001401446700002201460700002401482773013401506856007801640852000901718655001201727IND60586426520221118034336.0171213e20171129xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058642652DNAL7 a10.1021/jacs.7b112782doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Yongxi10aHigh Efficiency Near-Infrared and Semitransparent Non-Fullerene Acceptor Organic Photovoltaic Cells  ap. 17114-17119.  aThe absence of near-infrared (NIR) solar cells with high open circuit voltage (Vₒc) and external quantum efficiency (EQE) has impeded progress toward achieving organic photovoltaic (OPV) power conversion efficiency PCE > 15%.

Electrical Resistivity Tomography (ERT), Seismic Refraction Tomography (SRT), Multichannel Analysis of Surface Waves (MASW) and Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) were the techniques used to characterize a waste dump in the town of Dąbrowa Górnicza (S Poland). GPR and SRT were the most difficult methods to use because of the dense vegetation, which attenuated the passage of electromagnetic and seismic waves to the ground. However, GPR did turn out to be an appropriate tool for characterizing variations in the surface cover. ERT, SRT and MASW clearly highlighted the transition between the waste deposit and the host sediments, and determined the approximate thickness of the waste deposits. With MASW, however, the waste type and the boundary between the waste layer and surface cover could not be delineated. In some places, the surface cover was identified using SRT. With both these methods, the problem with identification may be due to the small contrast in the S- and P-wave velocities through two kinds of waste (municipal and industrial), the thinness of the waste layer, and the considerable differentiation of the surface cover. The most accurate results regarding the waste deposits were obtained using ERT and different electrode spacings. ERT pinpointed the exact location of the stored waste, distinguished between the types of waste, and identified the soil cover. Data from shallow boreholes confirmed the interpretations of the methods.  aPublisher supplied data 3aelectrical resistance 3aelectrodes 3ageophysics 3alandfills 3asoil 3atomography 3avegetation 3awaste management 3awastes 3aPoland 0aMASW 0aERT 0aSRT 0aGPR 0aIndustrial waste dump 0aMunicipal waste dump 0aCMP 0aε 0aERT 0aGPR 0aµ 0aMASW 0aσ 0aSRT 0aρ1 aStan-Kłeczek, Iwona1 aSitek, Sławomir1 aIgnatiuk, Dariusz0 tWaste management.g2021 Apr. 15, v. 125 p.27-39dElsevier LtdwJournal:6325x0956-053X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2021.02.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01967naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245013800168300001600306520066900322592002800991650002301019650001801042650001101060650001501071650002801086650002101114650002101135650004401156650001101200653002301211653004101234653003201275700001801307700001701325700002301342700002101365773007801386856008401464852000901548655001201557IND60582462320221121020417.0171006e201710  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058246232DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fitote.2017.09.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShao, Si-Yuan10aEight new phenylethanoid glycoside derivatives possessing potential hepatoprotective activities from the fruits of Forsythia suspensa  ap. 132-137.  aIn our study to investigate components with hepatoprotective activities, eight new phenylethanoid glycoside derivatives (1–8) were isolated from the 75% EtOH–H2O extract of the fruits of Forsythia suspensa along with six known compounds (9–14).

T.10aEffect of Germination and Fermentation on Carbohydrate Composition of Australian Sweet Lupin and Soybean Seeds and Flours  ap. 10064-10073.  aThis study investigated the effect of germination and fermentation on the composition of carbohydrates in Australian sweet lupin. Specifically, the amount of sugars (sucrose, fructose, and glucose), starch, oligosaccharides (verbascose, stachyose, and raffinose), and dietary fiber were measured in germinated lupin seeds and fermented lupin flour, and compared with those in soy. High performance liquid chromatography coupled with refractive index was employed for quantitation of sugars, starch, and oligosaccharides, and gas chromatography coupled with a flame ionization detector was used for quantitation of simple sugars in total, and soluble, and insoluble dietary fiber. The enzyme activities of α-amylase and α-glucosidase were compared before and after germination or fermentation. The α-amylase activity in germinated lupin increased to ∼17 nmol/mL/min/0.1 g and in germinated soy∼32; in fermented lupin, the activity increased to ∼52, while in fermented soy it decreased to ∼20. In general, germination or fermentation decreased the oligosaccharide content, and increased the total sugar in samples (p < 0.05). Total oligosaccharides in lupin after uncontrolled germination were reduced by 98% to 6 mg/g, and after controlled germination reduced by 44% to 86 mg/g. Fermentation with yogurt culture lowered the content of total oligosaccharides due to 94% decrease in stachyose. Total oligosaccharides in soy flour prior to fermentation were 180 mg/g and significantly decreased to ∼124 mg/g in fermented soy. Germination did not affect the starch content. There was no significant change in the amounts of total, soluble, and insoluble dietary fiber after germination or fermentation of lupin except for galactose, which was significantly reduced in germinated lupin seeds. Soluble dietary fiber in germinated soy significantly increased. Germination and fermentation are simple and effective techniques to reduce the oligosaccharides while maintaining the composition of dietary fibers.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLupinus 3aalpha-amylase 3aalpha-glucosidase 3acarbohydrate composition 3adietary fiber 3aenzyme activity 3afermentation 3aflame ionization 3afructose 3agalactose 3agermination 3aglucose 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3araffinose 3arefractive index 3aseeds 3asoy flour 3asoybeans 3astachyose 3astarch 3asucrose 3ayogurt 0alupin germination 0alupin fermentation 0anonstarch polysaccharides 0alupin oligosaccharides 0acarbohydrates in legumes1 aChandra-Hioe, Maria V.1 aZabaras, Dimitrios1 aFrank, Damian1 aArcot, Jayashree0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2017 Nov. 22, v. 65, no. 46 p.10064-10073dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:12177x1520-51187nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.jafc.7b029863Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02607naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245013900169300001600308520129600324592002801620650002001648650001201668650001401680650001201694650001501706650001701721650001601738650002901754650002101783653002401804653001901828653001701847653001201864653002801876700001701904700001901921700001901940700002101959773009901980856008502079852000902164655001202173IND60730124820221122142538.0220103e20210401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073012482DNAL7 a10.1016/j.wasman.2021.02.0232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, Yeong Min10aEvaluation of error inducing factors in unmanned aerial vehicle mounted detector to measure fugitive methane from solid waste landfill  ap. 368-376.  aMany methods have been applied to monitor fugitive methane gas from landfills. Recently, there have been suggestions to use a framework utilizing an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) for landfill gas monitoring, and several field campaigns have proved that a rotary UAV-based measurement has advantages of ease of control and high-resolution concentration mapping on the target planes. However, research on the evaluation of error-inducing factors in the suggested system is limited so far. This study prepared a measurement system with a lightweight methane detector and a rotary UAV to support the applicability of rotary UAV in landfill gas monitoring. Then, the validity of the system was tested experimentally and theoretically. In the detector reliability test, the methane detector had sufficient resolution for field application. The critical UAV velocity required was obtained to ensure the credibility of the proposed measurement system. When spatial interpolators were applied to field data from the measurement system, the empirical Bayesian kriging demonstrated the best prediction of methane concentrations at unmeasured points. With the verifications provided in this study, this proposed method may contribute to reducing uncertainty in estimating fugitive landfill gas emission.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBayesian theory 3akriging 3alandfills 3amethane 3aprediction 3asolid wastes 3auncertainty 3aunmanned aerial vehicles 3awaste management 0aEmission monitoring 0aGreenhouse gas 0aLandfill gas 0aMethane 0aUnmanned aerial vehicle1 aPark, Man Ho1 aJeong, Sangjae1 aLee, Kyeong Ho1 aKim, Chae-yŏng,0 tWaste management.g2021 Apr. 01, v. 124 p.368-376dElsevier LtdwJournal:6325x0956-053X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2021.02.0233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01736naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001700155245009200172300001600264520081700280592002801097650002401125650001701149650002401166700001701190700001601207700001501223773007501238856008901313990002301402852000901425655001201434IND60096044920221119092920.0141104e201312  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009604492DNAL7 a10.1016/j.compositesb.2013.06.0362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSantos, M.J.10aLow velocity impact damage evaluation in fiber glass composite plates using PZT sensors  ap. 269-276.  aIn this work PZT sensors are proposed to characterize the impact effects in fiber glass composite plates. To provide effective and reliable results the analysis was accomplished on samples submitted to multiple impacts, then guaranteeing the same testing conditions for different impact levels. The analysis of the impact effect has been made by two parameters; amplitude response and time shift. PZT sensors have been bonded to the samples in a pitch-and-catch configuration and the Lamb wave symmetrical mode (S₀) signal was used. The results demonstrate that the two evaluated parameters are able to characterise the different damage types occurring in these composites, as well as to evaluate their severity. It was also observed that amplitude predict well the defect size, whenever fiber-breakage occurs.  aPublisher supplied data 3acomposite materials 3aglass fibers 3asensors (equipment)1 aSantos, J.B.1 aAmaro, A.M.1 aNeto, M.A.0 tComposites.g2013 Dec., v. 55 p.269-276dElsevier Ltdx1359-83687nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.compositesb.2013.06.0363Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03319naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005600150245015100206300001600357520153700373592002801910650002101938650002401959650002501983650003502008650001702043650001302060650002702073650001902100650002302119650002502142650002002167650001902187653002702206653002402233653002302257653002502280653002602305653000802331653000902339653000802348653000902356653000802365653000802373653000802381653000902389653000802398653000802406653000902414700001402423700005202437700001802489700001702507773009902524856008502623852000902708655001202717IND60730124920221122142557.0220103e20210401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073012492DNAL7 a10.1016/j.wasman.2021.02.0242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShi, Xuchuan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0584-648110aSurfactant-assisted thermal hydrolysis off waste activated sludge for improved dewaterability, organic release, and volatile fatty acid production  ap. 339-347.  aThe surfactant-assisted thermal hydrolysis pretreatment (THP) of waste activated sludge (WAS) was investigated, focusing on the effect of the surfactant addition on the results of sludge disintegration, dewaterability, organic release, and production of volatile fatty acids (VFAs) via fermentation. Typical anionic surfactant sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) and cationic surfactant cetyl trimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB) were used for the THP experiments. The supernatant of the THP-treated sludge was anaerobically fermented to determine its potential VFAs yield. The results showed that the surfactant addition, particularly CTAB, enhanced the hydrolysis and organic solubilization of the sludge during THP. CTAB addition led to a 36% increase of dissolved organic and a 27% increase of VFAs production. For the THP-treated sludge with the surfactant addition, its dewaterability was also greatly improved. When the CTAB dosage increased from 0 to 0.10 g/g VSS, the minimum capillary suction time (CST) of the sludge decreased from 205 to 50 s/g TSS, and the sludge particles became smaller and less negative with the zeta potential changing from −12.4 to −8.2 mV. Analysis of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) of the sludge revealed that the surfactant addition increased the sludge disintegration and organic dissolution during the THP process. The surfactant-assisted THP is shown to be a promising technology to enhance the WAS treatment for improved sludge dewaterability, waste reduction, and resource recovery.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactivated sludge 3aanionic surfactants 3acationic surfactants 3acetyltrimethylammonium bromide 3afermentation 3apolymers 3asodium dodecyl sulfate 3asolubilization 3athermal hydrolysis 3avolatile fatty acids 3awaste reduction 3azeta potential 0aWaste activated sludge 0aSurfactant addition 0aThermal hydrolysis 0aVolatile fatty acids 0aSludge dewaterability 0aCST 0aCTAB 0aEPS 0aFEEM 0aSDS 0aTSS 0aTHP 0aVFAs 0aVSS 0aWAS 0aWWTP1 aZhu, Ling1 aLi, Bing1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7161-04771 aLiang, Jiajin1 aLi, Xiao-yan0 tWaste management.g2021 Apr. 01, v. 124 p.339-347dElsevier LtdwJournal:6325x0956-053X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2021.02.0243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02345naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100001800154245016300172300001600335520115000351592002801501650001201529650002401541650001601565650001001581650001901591651001101610653002001621653001301641653001201654653001501666653001701681700002201698700001901720773013401739856008901873852000901962655001201971IND60755356820221122230632.0211030e20211025xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075535682DNAL7 a10.1600/036364421X163120679133452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLuna, Naédja10aTaxonomic Study of the Species of Maranta Plum ex.

While 20 names have been proposed in the region, only 13 are accepted. We provide two new records, M. rugosa and M. polystachya, and five new species are described, of which M. bahiensis and M. villosovaginata are endemic to Bahia, M. chrysogina to Ceará, M. vieirae to Maranhão, and M. lorifolia occurs in Bahia and Espírito Santo. Maranta noctiflora, M. parvifolia, M. phrynioides, and M. rupicola L. have distributions outside of the study area, while M. anderssoniana and M. hatschbachiana are synonymized. Our final checklist includes 21 species, which represent more than half of the species in the genus, highlighting northeastern Brazil as a center of diversity for Maranta. Among the species listed, M. lorifolia, M. tuberculata, and M. zingiberina are thought to be endangered (EN), while M. gigantea is likely critically endangered (CR). Finally, this study provides informal conservation statuses, descriptions, distribution maps, and an identification key to the species. Typifications for M. subterranea and M. polystachya are also provided.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMaranta 3acenter of diversity 3anew species 3aplums 3ataxonomic keys 3aBrazil 0aAtlantic Forest 0aCaatinga 0aCerrado 0aNeotropics 0aZingiberales1 aPessoa, Edlley M.1 aAlves, Marccus0 tSystematic botany.g2021 Oct. 25, v. 46, no. 3 p.582-610dAmerican Society of Plant ToxonomistswJournal:jnl7985x0363-64457nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1600/036364421X163120679133453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02451naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245010800169300001800277520130600295592002801601650000801629650001301637650001001650650001801660650001401678650001901692653001801711653002401729653001901753653001601772653001901788653001201807700002501819700002801844773009901872856008501971852000902056655001202065IND60761814820221119115845.0220207e202202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076181482DNAL7 a10.1016/j.renene.2021.12.0892doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSengupta, Ayan10aComputational performance analysis of a solar chimney using surface modifications of the absorber plate  ap. 1095-1109.  aSolar chimney technology has received considerable attention in recent years as it offers suitable thermal comfort at the desired space and involves no running cost and harmful emissions. The heat transfer and ventilation performance of the solar chimney greatly depend on the configuration of the absorber plate. Thus, the present paper numerically investigates the effect of variations in geometrical configurations of the wavy absorber plate such as the number of waves, wave amplitude, inclination angle of the chimney, inclination angle of the glass plate, and air gap. The numerical analysis suggested optimum number of waves to be 10 (Nu = 210), optimum inclination of the chimney to be 55° (Nu = 220), and optimum wave amplitude to be 6.25 cm (Nu = 232). However, no optimum values were obtained for variations in glass plate inclination and the air gap. The inverted T plate surface geometry (Nu = 252–257) delivered the highest enhancement in heat transfer performance relative to other surface geometries. Correlations have been developed for the performance parameters by performing several numerical experiments and the proposed mass flow rate correlation predicts 91.3% of the data within ±7%, whereas, the Nusselt number correlation predicts 93.47% of the data within ±7%.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3ageometry 3aglass 3aheat transfer 3amass flow 3asolar chimneys 0aSolar chimney 0aWavy absorber plate 0aWave amplitude 0aWave number 0aMass flow rate 0aAir gap1 aMishra, Dipti Prasad1 aSarangi, Shailesh Kumar0 tRenewable energy.g2022 Feb., v. 185 p.1095-1109dElsevier LtdwJournal:11970x0960-14817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.renene.2021.12.0893Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02929naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002300146245019700169300001600366520113800382592002801520650002401548650002701572650002301599650002601622650001701648650001801665650001001683650001701693650001901710650001701729650001901746650001801765650000901783650001701792650001301809650001601822650001901838650002101857650001601878653001701894653001701911653001801928653002901946653002701975700001902002700002002021700002202041700002102063700006102084773012902145856008002274852000902354655001202363IND60622202920221118045059.0181124e201812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062220292DNAL7 a10.1177/10820132187921332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRestrepo, Andrea E10aMechanical, barrier, and color properties of banana starch edible films incorporated with nanoemulsions of lemongrass (Cymbopogon citratus) and rosemary (Rosmarinus officinalis) essential oils  ap. 705-712.  aEdible films are among the most promising fields in food science over the last decade due to their versatility (they can be made from a wide array of materials) and because they can be used as carriers of different active substances, like antioxidants, antimicrobial agents, and essential oils from plants. In the case of the essential oils, their inclusion in edible films is limited by their low water solubility. Nanoemulsions are thermodynamically stable and transparent systems that can be used as a way of incorporating essential oils into edible film matrices. In this paper, we developed lemongrass and rosemary essential oil nanoemulsions by using a low-energy method, observing the effect of the surfactant/oil ratio in their physicochemical properties. Then we studied the effect of the nanoemulsions concentration incorporated into banana starch edible films. We observed that essential oils’ nanoemulsions have a plasticizing effect increasing the film’s water vapor permeability, transparency, and elongation at break, while the hydrophobic nature of the essential oils lead to a decrease in their water solubility.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCymbopogon citratus 3aRosmarinus officinalis 3aactive ingredients 3aanti-infective agents 3aantioxidants 3abanana starch 3acolor 3aedible films 3aessential oils 3afood science 3ahydrophobicity 3ananoemulsions 3aoils 3apermeability 3arosemary 3asurfactants 3athermodynamics 3awater solubility 3awater vapor 0aEdible films 0ananoemulsion 0abanana starch 0alemongrass essential oil 0arosemary essential oil1 aRojas, José D1 aGarcía, Omar R1 aSánchez, Leidy T1 aPinzón, Magda I1 aVilla, Cristian C1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6530-25690 tFood science and technology international.g, v. 24, no. 8 p.705-712dSAGE PublicationswJournal:jnl3949853x1082-01327nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/10820132187921333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02792naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100001800138245007900156300001600235520160800251592002801859650001901887650001801906650001101924650001401935650002101949650002601970650001201996650001502008650001102023650001902034650001102053650001802064651001302082700002302095700001902118700002102137773014302158856007202301852000902373655001202382IND60661963520221120025625.0190904e20100115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066196352DNAL7 a10.1039/b914015h2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNewton, Alice10aMonitoring of oxygen condition in the Ria Formosa coastal lagoon, Portugal  ap. 355-360.  aDissolved oxygen (DO) is one of the most important environmental variables of water quality, especially for marine life. Consequently, oxygen is one of the Chemical Quality Elements required for the implementation of European Union Water Framework Directive. This study uses the example of the Ria Formosa, a meso-tidal lagoon on the south coast of Portugal to demonstrate how monitoring of water quality for coastal waters must be well designed to identify symptoms of episodic hypoxia. New data from the western end of the Ria Formosa were compared to values in a database of historical data and in the published literature to identify long-term trends. The dissolved oxygen concentration values in the database and in the literature were generally higher than those found in this study, where episodic hypoxia was observed during the summer. Analysis of the database showed that the discrepancy was probably related with the time and the sites where the samples had been collected, rather than a long-term trend. The most problematic situations were within the inner lagoon near the city of Faro, where episodic hypoxia (<2 mg dm⁻³ DO) occurred regularly in the early morning. These results emphasise the need for a balanced sampling strategy for oxygen monitoring which includes all periods of the day and night, as well as a representative range of sites throughout the lagoon. Such a strategy would provide adequate data to apply management measures to reduce the risk of more persistent hypoxia that would impact on the ecological, economic and leisure uses of this important natural resource.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEuropean Union 3acoastal water 3acoasts 3adatabases 3adissolved oxygen 3aenvironmental factors 3ahypoxia 3amonitoring 3aoxygen 3arisk reduction 3asummer 3awater quality 3aPortugal1 aOliveira, Pedro S.1 aIcely, John D.1 aFoster, Peter A.0 tJournal of environmental monitoring.g2010 Jan. 15, v. 12, no. 1 p.355-360dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:27191x1464-03337nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/b914015h3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02381naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100002500112245013100137300001600268520134300284592002801627650001201655650002001667650001501687650001101702650001101713650001401724651000901738653002701747653001401774653001601788653001601804700002201820700002201842700002101864773012501885852000902010655001202019IND60747710620221119132332.0210818e202104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074771062DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAl-Khion, Dhafar Dh.10aLevels and source of aliphatic hydrocarbons in marine fishes from coast of Iraq based on biomarkers and biogeochemical indices  ap. 536-544.  aThe total n-alkane concentrations in the fish tissue samples were 9.14 |jg g⁻¹ Dwt, and the Pr and Ph concentrations were 0.22 and 0.85 jig g⁻¹ Dwt, respectively. The CPI (carbon preference index) values ranged from 0.76 to 2.01 and the Pr/Ph ratios were 0.16–1.40. The fraction of n-alkanes in the tissue samples from petroleum sources was estimated to be 83%, whereas the fraction from natural biogenic sources (marine algae, bacteria, and terrestrial plants) was 17%. The application of biomarker indices such CPI and Pr/Ph ratios indicated that AHs were mainly a mixture of anthropogenic and natural biogenic sources. The CPI|ₒ₍ₑₗ values signified that petroleum was a major sources of AHs in these fishes. The Pr/Ph ratios suggested different sources, including fossil fuel and petroleum by-products, as well as biological and chemical alteration under redox/anoxic conditions. The presence of a high fraction of n-alkanes from petroleum and crude oil sources in the tissues of these fishes indicated that their nursing habitats were critically contaminated by petroleum hydrocarbons. The results of this study suggest that further researches are needed to study the bioaccumulation of other organic pollutants, such as pesticides, plasticizers, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in the marine biota of the region.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalkanes 3abioaccumulation 3abiomarkers 3acarbon 3acoasts 3apetroleum 3aIraq 0aAliphatic hydrocarbons 0aN-Alkanes 0aIsoprenoids 0aMarine fish1 aAl-Ali, Balqes S.1 aAl-Saad, Hamid T.1 aRushdi, Ahmed I.0 tIndian journal of ecology.g2021 Apr., v. 48, no. 2 p.536-544dIndian Ecological SocietywJournal:16635x0304-52507nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle02466naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245010300168300001800271520138300289592002801672650001701700650002001717650002401737650001801761653001201779653001601791653001101807653002401818653002801842700001701870700001101887700001301898773009901911856008502010852000902095655001202104IND60761815120221119115608.0220207e202202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076181512DNAL7 a10.1016/j.renene.2021.12.0982doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Qingsong10aPerformance assessment of an innovative Gurney flap for straight-bladed vertical axis wind turbine  ap. 1124-1138.  aBased on the vortex trapping capability of the cavity and the lift improvement mechanism for the Gurney Flap (GF), their combined impact on aerodynamic efficiency of the straight-bladed vertical axis wind turbine (SB-VAWT) was investigated. In order to eliminate the flow resistance of the blade caused by GF in the windward zone, an active flow control technique, a pivoting GF could change its position as the blades rotates in a cycle, is proposed in this paper. A grid sensitivity analysis by Grid Convergence Index (GCI) is first carried out to examine the convergence of the numerical model. Considering different GF control strategies, Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) method was used to evaluate the potential of the movable cavity-GF (c-GF) for power augmentation of SB-VAWT with traditional fixed cavity-GF. The simulation results show that power coefficient for movable c-GF is increased by more than 20% in comparison with the clean one. An appropriate active control solution not only has excellent power extraction in the downwind revolution, but also can significantly eliminate the resistance effect in the upwind zone cause by fixed c-GF. In addition, the benefits of the movable c-GF were prominent especially at the smaller tip speed ratios which indicates that it can be used for both newly designed turbines and retrofitting solutions for existing rotors.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaerodynamics 3aflow resistance 3amathematical models 3awind turbines 0aSB-VAWT 0aGurney flap 0aCavity 0aActive flow control 0aAerodynamic performance1 aMiao, Weipao1 aYe, Qi1 aLi, Chun0 tRenewable energy.g2022 Feb., v. 185 p.1124-1138dElsevier LtdwJournal:11970x0960-14817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.renene.2021.12.0983Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03604naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100003500150245012800185506010400313506007600417520176000493592002802253506003702281650001302318650001802331650001602349650001102365650001702376650002402393650001902417651001702436653002302453653002302476653002702499653002102526700006102547700001802608700002002626700002902646700001902675700006102694700002802755700006502783700005802848773011002906856008503016852000903101655001203110IND60787408820221207101110.0220921e20221001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078740882DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envpol.2022.1198832doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aArowosegbe, Oluwaseyi Olalekan10aEnsemble averaging using remote sensing data to model spatiotemporal PM10 concentrations in sparsely monitored South Africa  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThere is a paucity of air quality data in sub-Saharan African countries to inform science driven air quality management and epidemiological studies. We investigated the use of available remote-sensing aerosol optical depth (AOD) data to develop spatially and temporally resolved models to predict daily particulate matter (PM₁₀) concentrations across four provinces of South Africa (Gauteng, Mpumalanga, KwaZulu-Natal and Western Cape) for the year 2016 in a two-staged approach. In stage 1, a Random Forest (RF) model was used to impute Multiangle Implementation of Atmospheric Correction AOD data for days where it was missing. In stage 2, the machine learner algorithms RF, Gradient Boosting and Support Vector Regression were used to model the relationship between ground-monitored PM₁₀ data, AOD and other spatial and temporal predictors. These were subsequently combined in an ensemble model to predict daily PM₁₀ concentrations at 1 km × 1 km spatial resolution across the four provinces. An out-of-bag R² of 0.96 was achieved for the first stage model. The stage 2 cross-validated (CV) ensemble model captured 0.84 variability in ground-monitored PM₁₀ with a spatial CV R² of 0.48 and temporal CV R² of 0.80. The stage 2 model indicated an optimal performance of the daily predictions when aggregated to monthly and annual means. Our results suggest that a combination of remote sensing data, chemical transport model estimates and other spatiotemporal predictors has the potential to improve air quality exposure data in South Africa's major industrial provinces. In particular, the use of a combined ensemble approach was found to be useful for this area with limited availability of air pollution ground monitoring data.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aaerosols 3aair pollution 3aair quality 3amodels 3aparticulates 3aregression analysis 3aremote sensing 3aSouth Africa 0aEnsemble averaging 0aParticulate matter 0aSatellite observations 0aMachine learning1 aRöösli, Martin,1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7475-15311 aKünzli, Nino1 aSaucy, Apolline1 aAdebayo-Ojo, Temitope C.1 aSchwartz, Joel1 aKebalepile, Moses1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5346-57981 aJeebhay, Mohamed Fareed1 aDalvie, Mohamed Aqiel1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2192-09011 ade Hoogh, Kees1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5974-20070 tEnvironmental pollution.g2022 Oct. 01, v. 310 p.119883-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl41014x0269-74917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2022.1198833Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02670naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002300148245009900171300001600270520139400286592002801680650001201708650001201720650001901732650001401751650001701765650002601782650002301808650000901831650002201840650001401862651001301876653002101889653001401910653002601924653001501950653001501965653002301980653001302003653001302016773010402029856008202133852000902215655001202224IND60622203220221118045110.0181124e200005  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062220322DNAL7 a10.1191/0959683006661469932doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCurry, Alastair M.10aHolocene reworking of drift-mantled hillslopes in Glen Docherty, Northwest Highlands, Scotland  ap. 509-518.  aSections exposed within a colluvial debris cone in Glen Docherty, Scotland, reveal in-situ palaeosols intercalated with debrisflow diamictons and horizons of slopewash deposits. Radiocarbon dating of the palaeo sols suggests that drift reworking at this site involved brief, intermittent episodes of debrisflow and slopewash activity since c. 6.5 cal. ka BP. At least four such phases can be recognized: c. 6.5–6.2, 5.6–5.3, 4.9–4.6 cal. ka BP and after c. 450 cal. BP. The palaeosols examined show no evidence of local burning of vegetation. A calibrated radiocarbon age for the onset of the most recent phase of reworking may be interpreted as reflecting woodland clearance and/or the influence of extreme rainfall events during the ‘Little Ice Age’ period of regional climatic deterioration. The combined chronostratigraphic and palaeoecological evidence points to discrete, local rainstorms that are seemingly unrelated to long-term climatic change as the most likely cause of enhanced slope reworking, at least prior to c. 450 cal. BP. If this interpretation is valid, it implies that the formation of Holocene debris cones elsewhere in upland Britain may have been due primarily to a small number of localized, extreme rainstorm events. Consequently, caution is necessary in using debrisflow chronostratigraphy alone as a means of reconstructing long-term climate patterns.  aPublisher supplied data 3aburning 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3ahighlands 3apaleoecology 3apaleosolic soil types 3aradiocarbon dating 3arain 3atopographic slope 3awoodlands 3aScotland 0aGlacigenic drift 0areworking 0acolluvial debris cone 0adebrisflow 0apalaeosols 0aextreme rainstorms 0aScotland 0aHolocene0 tHolocene.g2000 May, v. 10, no. 4 p.509-518dSage PublicationswJournal:J000001502x0959-68367nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1191/0959683006661469933Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03210naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245012400172300001600296520175200312592002802064650001702092650002602109650002102135650001102156650002502167650002602192650002402218650000902242650001602251650002102267650001502288651001002303653003202313653004402345653001702389653005302406653002002459700001502479700001802494700001402512700001402526773010502540856008602645852000902731655001202740IND60586164320221120030815.0200427e201801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058616432DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhydrol.2017.11.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Chenglong10aInexact nonlinear improved fuzzy chance-constrained programming model for irrigation water management under uncertainty  ap. 397-408.  aAn inexact nonlinear mλ-measure fuzzy chance-constrained programming (INMFCCP) model is developed for irrigation water allocation under uncertainty. Techniques of inexact quadratic programming (IQP), mλ-measure, and fuzzy chance-constrained programming (FCCP) are integrated into a general optimization framework. The INMFCCP model can deal with not only nonlinearities in the objective function, but also uncertainties presented as discrete intervals in the objective function, variables and left-hand side constraints and fuzziness in the right-hand side constraints. Moreover, this model improves upon the conventional fuzzy chance-constrained programming by introducing a linear combination of possibility measure and necessity measure with varying preference parameters. To demonstrate its applicability, the model is then applied to a case study in the middle reaches of Heihe River Basin, northwest China. An interval regression analysis method is used to obtain interval crop water production functions in the whole growth period under uncertainty. Therefore, more flexible solutions can be generated for optimal irrigation water allocation. The variation of results can be examined by giving different confidence levels and preference parameters. Besides, it can reflect interrelationships among system benefits, preference parameters, confidence levels and the corresponding risk levels. Comparison between interval crop water production functions and deterministic ones based on the developed INMFCCP model indicates that the former is capable of reflecting more complexities and uncertainties in practical application. These results can provide more reliable scientific basis for supporting irrigation water management in arid areas.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase studies 3airrigation management 3airrigation water 3amodels 3aproduction functions 3aquadratic programming 3aregression analysis 3arisk 3auncertainty 3awater allocation 3awatersheds 3aChina 0aIrrigation water allocation 0aInterval crop water production function 0aNonlinearity 0amλ-Measure fuzzy chance-constrained programming 0aSystem benefits1 aZhang, Fan1 aGuo, Shanshan1 aLiu, Xiao1 aGuo, Ping0 tJournal of hydrology.g2018 Jan., v. 556 p.397-408dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl46539x0022-16947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2017.11.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02938naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001500150245015400165520152100319592002801840650002001868650001501888650002501903650002201928650002301950650001101973650003001984650001502014650001802029650001402047653001802061653001402079653002602093653002002119653002502139700001902164700001902183700001402202700001802216700005402234773011002288856008502398852000902483655001202492IND60787408920221118044757.0220921e20221001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078740892DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envpol.2022.1198842doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYan, Zehua10aPhthalates released from microplastics inhibit microbial metabolic activity and induce different effects on intestinal luminal and mucosal microbiota  aThe intestine is not only the main accumulation organ of microplastics (MPs), but also the intestinal environment is very conductive to the release of additives in MPs. However, the kinetics of release process, influence factors, and the related effects on gut microbiota remain largely unknown. In this study, a mucosal-simulator of the human intestinal microbial ecosystem (M-SHIME) was used to investigate the influence of gut microbiota on the release of phthalates (PAEs) from MPs and the effects of MPs on the intestinal luminal microbiota and mucosal microbiota. We found that di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP), di-n-butyl phthalate (DBP), and dimethyl phthalate (DMP) were the dominant PAEs released in the gut. Gut microbiota accelerated the release of PAEs, with the time to reach the maximum release was shortened from 7 days to 2 days. Moreover, MPs induced differential effects on luminal microbiota and mucosal microbiota. Compared with mucosal microbiota, the luminal microbiota was more susceptible to the leaching of PAEs from MPs, as evidenced by more microbiota alterations. MPs also inhibited the metabolic activity of intestinal flora based on the reduced production of short chain fatty acids (SCFA). These effects were mainly contributed by the release of PAEs. Acidaminococcus and Morganella were simultaneously correlated to the release of PAEs and the inhibition of metabolic activity of intestinal microbiota and can be used as indicators for the intestinal exposure of MPs and additives.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcidaminococcus 3aMorganella 3abiochemical pathways 3adibutyl phthalate 3adimethyl phthalate 3ahumans 3aintestinal microorganisms 3aintestines 3amicroplastics 3apollution 0aMicroplastics 0aAdditives 0aIntestinal microbiota 0aKinetic release 0aMetabolic inhibition1 aZhang, Shenghu1 aZhao, Yonggang1 aYu, Wenyi1 aZhao, Yanping1 aZhang, Yan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4762-66390 tEnvironmental pollution.g2022 Oct. 01, v. 310 p.119884-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl41014x0269-74917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2022.1198843Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03640naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100001800154245019500172300001600367520201900383592002802402650001502430650001102445650001102456650001002467650001202477650001602489650001402505650002702519650001202546650001202558650001302570650002002583651001202603653001702615653001502632653001602647653002502663653002502688653003302713653002202746700001802768700001802786700002202804700002102826700001802847773015902865856008903024852000903113655001203122IND60594316920221120045731.0180619e201712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059431692DNAL7 a10.3161/15081109ACC2017.19.2.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStumpf, Maike10aHow Do Young Bats Find Suitable Swarming and Hibernation Sites? Assessing the Plausibility of the Maternal Guidance Hypothesis Using Genetic Maternity Assignment for two European Bat Species  ap. 319-327.  aIn many temperate zone bat species, large numbers of individuals aggregate in autumn at potential hibernacula such as caves, mines, and cellars, for a behaviour known as swarming. This autumn swarming probably serves two functions, the achievement of matings and the assessment of potential hibernation sites. Even though this remarkable behaviour has attracted a lot of research during the last decades, several central questions regarding the autumn swarming of temperate zone bats remain unanswered. One of them is how juvenile bats (defined here as young of the year) are able to find swarming sites, which are typically dozens of kilometres away from the maternity colonies where they had been born. In this study, we used a combination of field data and population genetic tools to assess whether the juveniles are likely to learn the location of swarming sites from their mothers. To obtain non-destructive wing-tissue samples for DNA-based maternity assignments, 170 Myotis daubentonii and 195 Myotis nattereri were captured during the swarming seasons in two subsequent years, at a large hibernaculum in Germany. Based on 14, respectively 13, highly polymorphic microsatellite loci, maternity assignment tests were conducted for all captured adult females and juveniles that had been born in the two respective years. For M. daubentonii we found four assigned mother-offspring pairs, whereas in M. nattereri, eight mother-offspring pairs could be assigned with high certainty. Moreover, among the latter species, in seven pairs the mothers and the assigned offspring were caught within ten minutes of one another on the same night. Using a simulation, we show that for M. nattereri, significantly more juveniles than expected are caught together with their mothers at the hibernacula. We discuss the implications of our findings with regard to understanding autumn swarming behaviour in temperate zone bats, as well as for the conservation of bats that depend on swarming sites for mating and hibernation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChiroptera 3aadults 3aautumn 3acaves 3afemales 3ahibernation 3ajuveniles 3amicrosatellite repeats 3amothers 3aprogeny 3aswarming 3atemperate zones 3aGermany 0aconservation 0aChiroptera 0ahibernacula 0ainformation transfer 0amaternity assignment 0amaternal guidance hypothesis 0aswarming behavior1 aMeier, Frauke1 aGrosche, Lena1 aHalczok, Tanja K.1 aSchaik, Jaap Van1 aKerth, Gerald0 tActa chiropterologica.g2017 Dec., v. 19, no. 2 p.319-327dMuseum and Institute of Zoology at the Polish Academy of SciencewJournal:2176x1733-53297nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3161/15081109ACC2017.19.2.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02843naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100001900154245011700173300001600290520163800306592002801944650002101972650000801993650001702001650001002018650001502028650001402043650001402057650001602071650002402087651001202111651001102123653001002134653001102144653001402155653001602169700001602185773013402201856008902335852000902424655001202433IND60755357420221122235713.0211030e20211025xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075535742DNAL7 a10.1600/036364421X163120679134172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAllen, Maya L.12aA Revised Classification of Glossopetalon (Crossosomataceae) Based on Restriction Site-Associated DNA Sequencing  ap. 562-572.  aGlossopetalon inhabits arid regions in the American west and northern Mexico on limestone substrates. The genus comprises four species: G. clokeyi, G. pungens, G. texense, and G. spinescens. Three of the species are narrow endemics. The fourth, G. spinescens, is a widespread species with six recognized varieties. All six varieties are intricately branched shrubs that have been difficult to identify due to a lack of clearly delineating morphological characters. Characters typically used to differentiate the varieties of G. spinescens, such as stem coloration, leaf blade size, and presence of stipules, are highly variable within and among populations. A custom protocol of double digest restriction-site associated DNA sequencing (ddRAD) was used to resolve the phylogeny of Glossopetalon and address if population genetic data analyses (such as STRUCTURE, SVDquartets, and phylogenetic networks) support the recognition of six varieties of G. spinescens. Glossopetalon was fully supported as monophyletic and G. pungens was resolved sister to the remaining taxa in the genus. The varieties of G. spinescens were resolved as two distinct lineages corresponding to their biogeography, one to the northwest (lineage 1) and one to southeast (lineage 2) of the species range. Glossopetalon clokeyi was resolved at the base of lineage 1 and G. texense was embedded within lineage 2 sister to G. spinescens var. spinescens. Taxonomic changes include the recognition of G. texense and G. clokeyi as varieties of G. spinescens and description of a unique population from northern Arizona as a new variety, G. spinescens var. goodwinii.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCrossosomataceae 3aDNA 3abiogeography 3acolor 3aleaf blade 3alimestone 3amonophyly 3anew variety 3apopulation genetics 3aArizona 3aMexico 0addRAD 0aRADseq 0aSTRUCTURE 0aSVDquartets1 aAyers, Tina0 tSystematic botany.g2021 Oct. 25, v. 46, no. 3 p.562-572dAmerican Society of Plant ToxonomistswJournal:jnl7985x0363-64457nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1600/036364421X163120679134173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02924naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100002500138245010900163300001800272520155300290592002801843650001901871650001601890650002901906650002401935650001201959650001201971650001501983650003001998650003502028650003402063650002502097650002502122700001902147700001802166700001602184700002102200700002302221700002102244773014402265856007202409852000902481655001202490IND60661964020221120073206.0190904e20100513xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066196402DNAL7 a10.1039/b914504d2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBergkvist, Charlotte12aA probabilistic approach for estimating infant exposure to environmental pollutants in human breast milk  ap. 1029-1036.  aEffective risk assessment and management are often hampered by a lack of reliable exposure data. The probabilistic exposure assessment approach takes into account individual variations in exposure, and thus, overly conservative estimates based on worst case scenarios can be avoided. The aim was to provide reliable information on the intake of non-dioxinlike (NDL) and dioxinlike PCBs, PCDDs and PCDFs in breastfed infants and their mothers during 2000–2006. Hence, a probabilistic model was developed to estimate the exposure and compare it with a deterministic exposure assessment approach. The estimated probabilistic mean intake in 1, 3 and 6 months old infants was 44, 31 and 17 pg total-TEQ/kg bw per day, and 418, 294 and 165 ng NDL-PCBs/kg bw per day, respectively. Intakes differed up to 41% between the upper-bound percentiles of the probabilistic approach and the deterministic worst case scenario approach, whereas no difference in mean values was observed between the two approaches. The median cumulative intake increased during 6 months of breastfeeding to 20 ng total-TEQ and 352 μg NDL-PCBs. There was a significant temporal decrease in infant exposure during 2000–2006 (30%). Less than 4% of the mothers had an intake exceeding the TDI of 2 pg TEQ/kg bw per day (median: 1.2 pg total-TEQ/kg bw). To conclude, by use of a probabilistic approach and biomonitoring data we were able to calculate reliable estimates of infant exposure to environmental pollutants and the daily intakes of the nursing mothers using the same data.  aPublisher supplied data 3abreast feeding 3abreast milk 3aenvironmental monitoring 3aexposure assessment 3ainfants 3amothers 3apollutants 3apolychlorinated biphenyls 3apolychlorinated dibenzodioxins 3apolychlorinated dibenzofurans 3aprobabilistic models 3aprobability analysis1 aLignell, Sanna1 aSand, Salomon1 aAune, Marie1 aPersson, Mathias1 aHåkansson, Helen,1 aBerglund, Marika0 tJournal of environmental monitoring.g2010 May 13, v. 12, no. 5 p.1029-1036dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:27191x1464-03337nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/b914504d3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03644naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002400148245009500172300001600267520227800283592002802561650001902589650001202608650001202620650001102632650001202643650001302655650001902668650000802687650001202695650001402707650001602721650001202737651001402749651001202763653001302775653002302788653002302811653001702834653001102851653002502862653001902887700002702906700002102933773010502954856008203059852000903141655001203150IND60622203420221118045042.0181124e200001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062220342DNAL7 a10.1191/0959683006662131692doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAslaug Geirsdottir,10aLate-Holocene terrestrial glacial history of Miki and I.C. Jacobsen Fjords, East Greenland  ap. 123-134.  aWe present a late-Holocene glacial and environmental history of three valleys within Miki and I.C. Jacobsen Fjords, East Greenland (68°N). The fjords have no direct connection with the main ice sheet and are presently glacierized by a series of local ice caps and glaciers. Little sediment has been deposited within the study area, but bedrock is distinctly glacially striated, which suggests that extensive valley glaciers reached the present coastline in the past. Moraines are the prominent morphological features including distinct end and lateral moraines. Most of the moraines are related to the existing glaciers in the area. Apparent moraines extend as far as 2 to 2.5 km in front of present-day glaciers. Based on morphological and stratigraphical studies of the sediments in these valleys, five glacier advances during the late Holocene are implied. Stabilization of the oldest moraines is lichenometrically dated toc. 1450 to 1650 years ago. Younger moraines in both Miki and I.C. Jacobsen Fjords are lichenometrically dated toc. 1050–1100 years ago,c. 750–950 years ago and c. 600–700 years ago. The youngest moraines containing measurable lichens stabilizedc. 300–400 years ago. The timing of this moraine formation correlates to marine records from previous research on the inner part of Miki Fjord, where apparent intensification in sediment stratification is related to a glacier advance into the fjordc. 290 years ago. This glacial advance may correlate to the‘Little Ice Age’ cooling observed in many records from the North Atlantic region. Our glacial record from Miki and I.C. Jacobsen Fjords also shows good correlation with temperature proxies within the GRIP ice core in Greenland and foraminifera records from Nansen Fjord, East Greenland. Less pronounced correlation is observed with the Icelandic Sea Ice Index and records of glacier fluctuation in Iceland during the last .1000 years. These results suggest that widespread climatic cooling was the direct cause of many of the late-Holocene glacier variations documented in this study, although the glacial advance atc. 1050–1100 years ago coincides with the so-called‘Medieval Warm Period’, and could reflect the response of glaciers to increased precipitation within the area.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHolocene epoch 3aRetaria 3abedrock 3acoasts 3acooling 3aglaciers 3aglobal cooling 3aice 3alichens 3asediments 3atemperature 3avalleys 3aGreenland 3aIceland 0aHolocene 0amoraine chronology 0aglacier variations 0alichenometry 0afjords 0a‘Little Ice Age’ 0aEast Greenland1 aJórunn Hardardóttir,1 aAndrews, John T.0 tHolocene.g2000 Jan., v. 10, no. 1 p.123-134dSage PublicationswJournal:J000001502x0959-68367nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1191/0959683006662131693Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03692naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100001800154245017600172300001600348520199800364592002802362650001902390650001702409650001202426650001802438650001402456650001402470650001402484650002702498650001702525651001502542651001002557651001102567653002802578653002702606653001702633653001902650700002302669700001802692700002002710700001902730700002102749700001902770700002302789700001802812700002102830700002302851700002002874773013402894856008903028961001203117852000903129655001203138IND60755357520221122235735.0211030e20211025xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075535752DNAL7 a10.1600/036364421X163120679134352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWillyard, Ann10aPhylogenomics in the Hard Pines (Pinus subsection Ponderosae; Pinaceae) Confirms Paraphyly in Pinus ponderosa, and Places Pinus jeffreyi with the California Big Cone Pines  ap. 538-561.  aWe sampled 130 individuals (2 to 25 per taxon) of Pinus subsections Ponderosae and Sabinianae. Nucleotide sequences were obtained by targeting 703 low copy nuclear genes. From the unenriched portion of the short reads, we assembled nearly complete plastome nucleotide sequences. We used 600 nuclear genes and the plastome sequences to create phylogenies and species trees that we compared to evaluate cytonuclear concordance and reticulation. We found that Pinus jeffreyi belongs with Pinus subsect. Sabinianae based on morphological synapomorphies as well as strong molecular phylogenetic support. Pinus ponderosa sensu lato is paraphyletic, and we suggest treatment as three species: P. ponderosa sensu stricto (with P. ponderosa var. ponderosa, P. ponderosa var. benthamiana, and P. ponderosa var. washoensis), P. scopulorum, and P. brachyptera. The persistence of lineages with the footprints of ancient nuclear introgression (labeled bpw in clade N4) and chloroplast capture (labeled bpw in clade P1) should caution species identification in Pinus subsection Ponderosae based on limited molecular data. The hybrid frequency was low based on cytonuclear discordance, and the persistence of an ancient P1 plastid clade is a better explanation than hybridization between P. ponderosa and P. jeffreyi for unexpected plastid associations in the western Sierra Nevada, USA. We identified a new potential zone of ancient admixture between P. ponderosa and P. scopulorum in Idaho, USA. Some populations of P. arizonica, P. brachyptera, P. engelmannii, and P. scopulorum in the USA are more closely related to taxa with distributions limited to Mexico than they are to each other. To integrate phylogeny and taxonomy, future work should sample widely in Mexico and the USA, score morphological characters (including seedling characters from the known seed parent), on the same individual as used for molecular data, and use methods that are based on individuals rather than population frequencies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPinus jeffreyi 3achloroplasts 3ahybrids 3aintrogression 3amountains 3aparaphyly 3aseedlings 3aspecies identification 3asynapomorphy 3aCalifornia 3aIdaho 3aMexico 0aCytonuclear discordance 0alow copy nuclear genes 0aJeffrey pine 0aponderosa pine1 aGernandt, David S.1 aCooper, Blake1 aDouglas, Connor1 aFinch, Kristen1 aKaremera, Hassan1 aLindberg, Erik1 aLanger, Stephen K.1 aLefler, Julia1 aMarquardt, Paula1 aPouncey, Dakota L.1 aTelewski, Frank0 tSystematic botany.g2021 Oct. 25, v. 46, no. 3 p.538-561dAmerican Society of Plant ToxonomistswJournal:jnl7985x0363-64457nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1600/036364421X163120679134353Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/FS  aDNAL 7aarticle04122naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001900145245017000164300001400334520226300348592002802611596004002639650001502679650001902694650001402713650002802727650001202755650001602767650002302783650002102806650004002827650000802867650001102875650001202886650002202898650003102920650001702951650002102968650001702989650002403006650001603030653002203046653002503068653002403093653003103117653002203148700001803170700002103188700002303209700002303232700002503255700002203280773014103302856008003443852000903523655001203532IND60621548920221122093126.0181203e20170101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062154892DNAL7 a10.3945/ajcn.116.1435522doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJoris, Peter J10aDiet-induced weight loss improves not only cardiometabolic risk markers but also markers of vascular function: a randomized controlled trial in abdominally obese men  ap. 23-31.  aBackground: Many trials assessing effects of dietary weight loss on vascular function have been performed without no–weight loss control groups and in individuals with obesity-related morbidities. Usually a limited set of vascular function markers has been investigated. Objective: The objective of this study was to examine effects of diet-induced weight loss on various vascular function markers and differences between normal-weight and abdominally obese men at baseline and after weight reduction. Design: Twenty-five healthy, normal-weight men (waist circumference: <94 cm) and 54 abdominally obese men (waist circumference: 102–110 cm) participated. Abdominally obese participants were randomly allocated to a dietary weight-loss or a no–weight loss control group. Individuals from the weight-loss group followed a calorie-restricted diet for 6 wk to obtain a waist circumference <102 cm followed by a weight-maintenance period of 2 wk. The control group maintained their habitual diet and physical activity levels. The primary outcome was the change in brachial artery flow-mediated vasodilation (FMD). Results: Compared with the control group, FMD did not change in the weight-loss group, but carotid-to-femoral pulse wave velocity tended to decrease by 0.5 m/s (P = 0.065). The retinal arteriolar caliber increased by 5 μm (P < 0.001) and the arteriolar-to-venular ratio by 0.02 (P < 0.01). Soluble endothelial selectin and soluble intercellular adhesion molecule concentrations decreased (P < 0.001). Also, total cholesterol, low–density lipoprotein cholesterol, triacylglycerol, glucose, insulin, C-peptide, homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance, and blood pressure improved (P < 0.05 for all variables). Except for FMD, these markers differed at baseline between normal-weight and abdominally obese men but became comparable after weight loss. Conclusions: In abdominally obese men, dietary weight loss targeting a waist circumference of <102 cm improved retinal microvascular caliber, plasma biomarkers of microvascular endothelial function, and the more conventional cardiometabolic risk markers. Aortic stiffness tended to decrease, but FMD was not changed. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT01675401.  aPublisher supplied data  cTop Institute of Food and Nutrition 3abiomarkers 3ablood pressure 3ac-peptide 3acell adhesion molecules 3aglucose 3ahomeostasis 3ainsulin resistance 3alow calorie diet 3alow density lipoprotein cholesterol 3amen 3amodels 3aobesity 3aphysical activity 3arandomized clinical trials 3arisk factors 3atriacylglycerols 3avasodilation 3awaist circumference 3aweight loss 0aabdominal obesity 0acardiometabolic risk 0adietary weight loss 0aflow-mediated vasodilation 0avascular function1 aPlat, Jogchum1 aKusters, Yvo HAM1 aHouben, Alfons JHM1 aStehouwer, Coen DA1 aSchalkwijk, Casper G1 aMensink, Ronald P0 tAmerican journal of clinical nutrition.g2017 Jan. 01, v. 105, no. 1 p.23-31dOxford University PresswJournal:jnl45206x1938-32077nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3945/ajcn.116.1435523Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03062naa a2200793 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002200151245008200173300001800255520112700273592002801400650001501428650001001443650001301453650001501466650001901481650001301500650002301513650001101536650001501547650001401562650002101576650001301597650002801610653000801638653000901646653000901655653000901664653000701673653000801680653000601688653000801694653001001702653001101712653000801723653001001731653000701741653001001748653000701758653000701765653000801772653000801780653000801788653000801796653000801804653000801812653000901820653000901829653000801838653000801846653000701854653000801861653002501869653000901894653000901903653001801912653001401930653000901944700002401953700002801977773015602005856008602161852000902247655001202256IND60539321720221117224757.0190215e20150622xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053932172DNAL7 a10.1016/j.febslet.2015.04.0572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aArts, Isabelle S.10aReducing systems protecting the bacterial cell envelope from oxidative damage  ap. 1559-1568.  aExposure of cells to elevated levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) damages DNA, membrane lipids and proteins, which can potentially lead to cell death. In proteins, the sulfur-containing residues cysteine and methionine are particularly sensitive to oxidation, forming sulfenic acids and methionine sulfoxides, respectively. The presence of protection mechanisms to scavenge ROS and repair damaged cellular components is therefore essential for cell survival. The bacterial cell envelope, which constitutes the first protection barrier from the extracellular environment, is particularly exposed to the oxidizing molecules generated by the host cells to kill invading microorganisms. Therefore, the presence of oxidative stress defense mechanisms in that compartment is crucial for cell survival. Here, we review recent findings that led to the identification of several reducing pathways protecting the cell envelope from oxidative damage. We focus in particular on the mechanisms that repair envelope proteins with oxidized cysteine and methionine residues and we discuss the major questions that remain to be solved.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA damage 3aacids 3abacteria 3acell death 3acell viability 3acysteine 3adefense mechanisms 3alipids 3amethionine 3aoxidation 3aoxidative stress 3aproteins 3areactive oxygen species 0aBCP 0ae− 0aH2O2 0aHOCl 0aIM 0aLPS 0aM 0aMet 0aMet-O 0aMet-O2 0aMsr 0aNADPH 0aO2 0aO2− 0aOM 0aPG 0aPrx 0aROS 0aRNS 0aRCS 0aSOD 0aSOH 0aSO2H 0aSO3H 0aSRP 0aTpx 0aTR 0aTrx 0aMethionine sulfoxide 0aDsbG 0aPilB 0aSulfenic acid 0aPeriplasm 0aDsbD1 aGennaris, Alexandra1 aCollet, Jean-François,0 tFEBS letters.g2015 June 22, v. 589, no. 14 p.1559-1568dElsevier B.V.aFederation of European Biochemical SocietieswJournal:jnl16404x0014-57937nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.febslet.2015.04.0573Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03268naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001600139245010400155300001800259500001900277500002000296520162500316592002801941596005301969596005202022596006902074596003902143596006602182650001202248650002502260650002202285650001102307650001602318650002002334650002402354650002002378650002902398700001902427700001802446700002402464700002502488700001802513700002002531700002302551773011802574856007302692852000902765655001202774IND60734409320221118233146.0210417e201312  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073440932DNAL7 a10.1111/nph.124372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSimon, Sibu10aDefining the selectivity of processes along the auxin response chain: a study using auxin analogues  ap. 1034-1048.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe mode of action of auxin is based on its non‐uniform distribution within tissues and organs. Despite the wide use of several auxin analogues in research and agriculture, little is known about the specificity of different auxin‐related transport and signalling processes towards these compounds. Using seedlings of Arabidopsis thaliana and suspension‐cultured cells of Nicotiana tabacum (BY‐2), the physiological activity of several auxin analogues was investigated, together with their capacity to induce auxin‐dependent gene expression, to inhibit endocytosis and to be transported across the plasma membrane. This study shows that the specificity criteria for different auxin‐related processes vary widely. Notably, the special behaviour of some synthetic auxin analogues suggests that they might be useful tools in investigations of the molecular mechanism of auxin action. Thus, due to their differential stimulatory effects on DR5 expression, indole‐3‐propionic (IPA) and 2,4,5‐trichlorophenoxy acetic (2,4,5‐T) acids can serve in studies of TRANSPORT INHIBITOR RESPONSE 1/AUXIN SIGNALLING F‐BOX (TIR1/AFB)‐mediated auxin signalling, and 5‐fluoroindole‐3‐acetic acid (5‐F‐IAA) can help to discriminate between transcriptional and non‐transcriptional pathways of auxin signalling. The results demonstrate that the major determinants for the auxin‐like physiological potential of a particular compound are very complex and involve its chemical and metabolic stability, its ability to distribute in tissues in a polar manner and its activity towards auxin signalling machinery.  aPublisher supplied data  aP305/11/0797cGrant Agency of the Czech Republic  a13‐40637ScGrant Agency of the Czech Republic  aCZ.1.05/1.1.00/02.0068cCentral European Institute of Technology  cEuropean Regional Development Fund  aERC‐2011‐StG‐20101109‐PSDPcEuropean Research Council 3a2,4,5-T 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aNicotiana tabacum 3aauxins 3aendocytosis 3agene expression 3amechanism of action 3aplasma membrane 3atranscription (genetics)1 aKubeš, Martin1 aBaster, Pawel1 aRobert, Stéphanie,1 aDobrev, Petre Ivanov1 aFriml, Jiří1 aPetrášek, Jan1 aZažímalová, Eva0 tnew phytologist.g2013 Dec., v. 200, no. 4 p.1034-1048dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl44665x0028-646X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/nph.124373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01422naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094024002100127024001900148040001800167100002100185245008100206300001200287506007600299520039400375592002800769506003700797650001700834650002200851650002300873700002100896773010300917856007901020852000901099655001201108IND60119502220221207104240.0141214e200401  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011950222DNAL7 a10.1186/gb-2004-5-2-2072doi7 aPMC3957412pmcid7 a147592502pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aConway, Edward M14aThe diversity of endothelial cells: a challenge for therapeutic angiogenesis  ap. 723.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aVascular endothelia comprise a diverse population of cells that specialize in response to genetic programs and environmental cues to take on distinct roles in different vessels, tissues, and organs, and in response to pathophysiological stresses.

Case study in a montado area in Southwestern Europe  ap. 3676-3683.  aThe use of forest and agricultural residues for energy production presents multiple benefits, but the link between bioenergy and the environment is complex and not all of the energetic options have the same impacts. This work evaluates the net positive effect of valorizing residual biomass in the context of a rural area of Portugal, Estremoz. It focuses on the combined assessment of biomass availability, techno-economic feasibility and environmental aspects of utilizing forest and agricultural residues to produce bioheat. At first, the energy potential of the residual biomass available in the municipality is evaluated using a geographical information system database. The assessment with RETScreen of the techno-economic feasibility of replacing electricity by biomass for heating local public schools follows. The results show that around 27 314 t of residues, corresponding to about 267 680 GJ, are produced each year in Estremoz, more than half in montado areas. The use of this biomass for the replacement of the existing electric heating systems of nine local schools by biomass-based ones offers good project profitability. As far as the environment is concerned, the energetic valorization of the residual biomass in Estremoz has multiple benefits. It contributes to climate change mitigation by saving greenhouse gas emissions and promoting the preservation of the traditional extensive uses of the ecosystems. Moreover, a correct vegetation management decreases the fire risk, potentiates the increase in biodiversity, offers better conditions for native species and allows to maintain the ecosystems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural wastes 3abiodiversity 3abioenergy 3abiomass 3acase studies 3aclimate change 3adatabases 3aecosystems 3aelectricity 3aenergy 3aforests 3ageographic information systems 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3ahabitat conservation 3aheating systems 3aindigenous species 3aprofitability 3apublic schools 3arisk 3arural areas 3aPortugal 0aBioenergy 0aResidual biomass 0aEnergy potential 0aHeating systems 0aPreservation of ecosystems 0aMontado1 aCarrajola, J.1 aGomes, C.

The reconstruction of annual runoff is a fundamental task for several activities related to water resources management, especially for ungauged basins. At catchment scales, the Budyko’s framework provides an extremely useful and, in some cases, accurate estimation of the long-term partitioning of precipitation into evapotranspiration and runoff as a function of the prevailing climatic conditions. Recently the same long-term partitioning rules have been successfully used to describe water partitioning also at the annual scale and calculate the annual runoff distribution within a simple analytic framework in arid and semi-arid basins. One of the main advantages of the latter method is that only annual precipitation and potential evapotranspiration statistics, and the Fu’s equation parameter ω are required to obtain the annual runoff probability distribution. The aim of this study is to test the limit and potentialities of the aforementioned method under different climatic conditions. To this aim, the model is applied to more than four hundred basins located in the United States. Catchments were grouped into five different samples, following the subdivision of the continental region in five homogeneous climatic zones according to Köppen-Geiger classification. The theoretical probability distribution of annual runoff at each basin has been compared with that derived from historical observations. The results confirm the capability of the tested technique to reproduce the empirical annual runoff distributions with similar and satisfactory performances across different areas, revealing a good option also in cases characterized by climate and hydrological conditions very different from those hypothesized during the original analytical model design, thus extending the geographical and conceptual limits of applicability of the framework.  aPublisher supplied data 3aatmospheric precipitation 3abasins 3aclimatic factors 3aclimatic zones 3aequations 3aevapotranspiration 3amodels 3aprobability distribution 3arunoff 3awater management 3awatersheds 3aUnited States1 aPumo, D.1 aViola, F.0 tWater resources management.g2018 July, v. 32, no. 9 p.3189-3202dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl44305x0920-47417nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11269-018-1984-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02699naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001400148245015800162300001600320520138700336592002801723650001501751650001601766650002001782650002501802650001201827650001201839650001101851650001601862653001901878653001701897653002301914653002201937653002901959653003001988700001502018700001902033700001402052700001302066773009502079856008202174852000902256655001202265IND60553453120221119202607.0170607e20150515xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055345312DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bios.2014.10.0212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, N.Y.12aA reusable robust radio frequency biosensor using microwave resonator by integrated passive device technology for quantitative detection of glucose level  ap. 687-693.  aA reusable robust radio frequency (RF) biosensor with a rectangular meandered line (RML) resonator on a gallium arsenide substrate by integrated passive device (IPD) technology was designed, fabricated and tested to enable the real-time identification of the glucose level in human serum. The air-bridge structure fabricated by an IPD technology was applied to the RML resonator to improve its sensitivity by increasing the magnitude of the return loss (S21). The resonance behaviour, based on S21 characteristics of the biosensor, was analysed at 9.20GHz with human serum containing different glucose concentration ranging from 148–268mgdl−1, 105–225mgdl−1 and at a deionised (D) water glucose concentration in the range of 25– 500mgdl−1 for seven different samples. A calibration analysis was performed for the human serum from two different subjects and for d-glucose at a response time of 60s; the reproducibility, the minimum shift in resonance frequency and the long-term stability of the signal were investigated. The feature characteristics based on the resonance concept after the use of serum as an analyte are modelled as an inductor, capacitor and resistor. The findings support the development of resonance-based sensing with an excellent sensitivity of 1.08MHz per 1mgdl−1, a detection limit of 8.01mgdl−1, and a limit of quantisation of 24.30mgdl−1.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiosensors 3ablood serum 3adetection limit 3aelectrical equipment 3agallium 3aglucose 3ahumans 3aradio waves 0aGlucose sensor 0aRF biosensor 0aReusable biosensor 0aMicrowave sensing 0aReal-time identification 0aIntegrated passive device1 aDhakal, R.1 aAdhikari, K.K.1 aKim, E.S.1 aWang, C.0 tBiosensors & bioelectronics.g2015 May 15, v. 67 p.687-693dElsevier B.V.x0956-56637nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bios.2014.10.0213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03216naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245011000168300001800278520173000296592002802026650002402054650002502078650001602103650001502119650002702134650002802161650001302189650001702202650001702219650001502236650001502251650003502266650001802301650002202319650001102341650001402352651001802366700001802384700001702402700001302419700002002432700006002452773013002512856008302642852000902725655001202734IND60739437820221120075417.0210731e202106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073943782DNAL7 a10.1007/s10811-021-02404-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRoszell, Jordan10aDivergent responses of diverse microalgae commonly found in drinking water source water to UV-C treatment  ap. 1541-1557.  aMicroalgae pose major problems for drinking water treatment processes either through membrane fouling or through blooming events in source water during the summer months. Disinfection treatments such as chlorination and UV-C treatment of drinking water are designed to remove microorganisms including microalgae and bacteria. In order to treat water efficiently it is critical to understand the effect of UV-C treatment on the viability and vitality of phytoplankton. Moreover, this information can be used to assess the utility of UV-C treatment as a potential pre-treatment option for water clean-up. In this study we tested the population growth of 6 phytoplankton species representing three major taxonomic groups (green algae, diatoms and cyanobacteria), commonly found in freshwater lakes in North America and relevant for water treatment facilities. We exposed these species to UV-C treatment and monitored their post-exposure population growth over a 52–55-day period using a plate-based MPN (most probable number) method. We found the green alga Scenedesmus quadricauda and the cyanobacterium Anabaena flos-aquae to be most tolerant to the treatment, while the cyanobacterium Microcystis aeruginosa and the diatom Asterionella formosa were found to be most sensitive with viability being reduced at comparatively lower doses. No significant delays in growth post treatment (i.e. time lags) were reported within species. Asterionella formosa and Aulacoseira granulata showed the longest time lags of all species, which might be in part correlated with DNA repair mechanisms and other physiological adaptations. This work provides the basis for the assessment of UV-C treatment efficacy on freshwater phytoplankton.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAnabaena flos-aquae 3aAsterionella formosa 3aAulacoseira 3aDNA repair 3aMicrocystis aeruginosa 3aScenedesmus quadricauda 3aalgology 3achlorination 3adisinfection 3afreshwater 3amicroalgae 3amost probable number technique 3aphytoplankton 3apopulation growth 3asummer 3aviability 3aNorth America1 aChan, Po-Shun1 aPetri, Brian1 aMao, Ted1 aNolan, Kathleen1 aHeyland, Andreas1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7592-44730 tJournal of applied phycology.g2021 June, v. 33, no. 3 p.1541-1557dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl3870059x0921-89717nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10811-021-02404-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02596naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001800143245011400161300001600275520125100291592002801542650001901570650002401589650001301613650002901626650001001655650001701665650002201682650002201704650001301726650001301739650001001752650000901762650001301771653001601784653002701800653001501827700001701842700001401859700005601873773013401929856007802063852000902141655001202150IND60759793620221118143922.0220209e20220201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075979362DNAL7 a10.1089/fpd.2021.00352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhu, Fangzhou10aMicrobial Inactivation Property of Pulsed Corona Discharge Plasma and Its Effect on Chilled Pork Preservation  ap. 159-167.  aAlthough plasma, especially atmospheric plasma generated by corona discharge, has been proven to be effective in sterilization and food preservation, its disinfection mechanism on chilled pork is poorly understood. In this research, the bactericidal and preservation effect of corona discharge plasma (CDP) was investigated. The maximum bactericidal effect was found after 20 kV 4 kHz CDP treatment, with 2.77 log (colony-forming unit [CFU]/g), 2.41 log (CFU/g), and 1.36 log (CFU/g) reduction for Pantoea agglomerans, Serratia liquefaciens, and Kurthia zopfii, respectively, after 10 min of exposure. The efficiency of microbial inactivation was attributed to the increase of ozone, hydrogen peroxide and morphological changes. It was observed that the microbial level and total volatile binding nitrogen value of CDP-treated chilled pork samples were suppressed during storage, whereas the increase of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances value and the changes of color were still worthy of attention. The aim of this study was to explore the effect of pulsed CDP on the inactivation of spoilage microorganism inoculated on the surface of fresh pork. The prospect of this technology in meat preservation industry was also investigated.  aPublisher supplied data 3aKurthia zopfii 3aPantoea agglomerans 3aSerratia 3aantibacterial properties 3acolor 3adisinfection 3afood preservation 3ahydrogen peroxide 3aindustry 3anitrogen 3aozone 3apork 3aspoilage 0acold plasma 0aspoilage microorganism 0afresh pork1 aDong, Zhiqin1 aLi, Xinfu1 aXiong, Qiang1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5569-42630 tFoodborne pathogens & disease.g2022 Feb. 01, v. 19, no. 2 p.159-167dMary Ann Liebert, Inc.wJournal:jnl3973649x1556-71257nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1089/fpd.2021.00353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02973naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001800139245013900157300001800296500001900314500002000333520166600353592002802019596007702047650002002124650003302144650001902177650001902196650002002215650001702235650001502252650001402267650003602281650002202317650001402339700002202353773011802375856007302493852000902566655001202575IND60734409420221118233523.0210417e201312  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073440942DNAL7 a10.1111/nph.124612doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOwen, Nick A.12aA system dynamics model integrating physiology and biochemical regulation predicts extent of crassulacean acid metabolism (CAM) phases  ap. 1116-1131.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aA system dynamics (SD) approach was taken to model crassulacean acid metabolism (CAM) expression from measured biochemical and physiological constants. SD emphasizes state‐dependent feedback interaction to describe the emergent properties of a complex system. These mechanisms maintain biological systems with homeostatic limits on a temporal basis. Previous empirical studies on CAM have correlated biological constants (e.g. enzyme kinetic parameters) with expression over the CAM diel cycle. The SD model integrates these constants within the architecture of the CAM ‘system’. This allowed quantitative causal connections to be established between biological inputs and the four distinct phases of CAM delineated by gas exchange and malic acid accumulation traits. Regulation at flow junctions (e.g. stomatal and mesophyll conductance, and malic acid transport across the tonoplast) that are subject to feedback control (e.g. stomatal aperture, malic acid inhibition of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase, and enzyme kinetics) was simulated. Simulated expression for the leaf‐succulent Kalanchoë daigremontiana and more succulent tissues of Agave tequilana showed strong correlation with measured gas exchange and malic acid accumulation (R² = 0.912 and 0.937, respectively, for K. daigremontiana and R² = 0.928 and 0.942, respectively, for A. tequilana). Sensitivity analyses were conducted to quantitatively identify determinants of diel CO₂ uptake. The transition in CAM expression from low to high volume/area tissues (elimination of phase II–IV carbon‐uptake signatures) was achieved largely by the manipulation three input parameters.  aPublisher supplied data  cAustralian Rural Industries Research and Development Corporation (RIRDC) 3aAgave tequilana 3aCrassulacean acid metabolism 3acarbon dioxide 3adynamic models 3aenzyme kinetics 3agas exchange 3amalic acid 3amesophyll 3aphosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase 3astomatal movement 3atonoplast1 aGriffiths, Howard0 tnew phytologist.g2013 Dec., v. 200, no. 4 p.1116-1131dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl44665x0028-646X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/nph.124613Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03537naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001500150245013100165300001600296520199400312592002802306650001502334650001002349650001402359650003102373650001902404650001902423650001802442650001202460650001002472650001502482650004802497650001702545650001402562650001402576650002202590650001102612650001402623653002202637653002302659653001902682653001902701700001602720700001702736700001402753700005702767773010102824856008502925852000903010655001203019IND60755244620221116154918.0211206e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075524462DNAL7 a10.1016/j.molimm.2021.10.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiao, Feng10aCommunity-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus provoked cytokine storm causing severe infection on BALB/c mice  ap. 167-174.  aMethicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) has become the most important pathogen of hospital-acquired (HA) or community-acquired (CA) infections. However, it is unclear of the cytokines responsible for pathological hyper-inflammation in sepsis related cytokine storm for MRSA infection. In this study, we selected typical HA-MRSA strain (YNSA163: ST239-t030-SCCmecⅢ) and two CA-MRSA isolates (YNSA7: ST59-t439-SCCmecⅣa and YNSA53: ST59-t437-SCCmecⅤb) from our previous research, infected on BALB/c mice, and analyzed the cytokine storm patterns during infection process. The animal experiments revealed the most serious lethal effect on BALB/c mice caused by YNSA7 strain infection, followed by YNSA53, and no BALB/c mice died for YNSA163 infection. Histopathological analyses revealed that lung was the most seriously damaged organs, followed by spleen and kidney, especially for CA-MRSA infection. The severe inflammatory reactions, tissue destruction, and massive exudation of inflammatory mediators and cells could be identified in CA-MRSA strains infected mice. Interleukin-6 (IL-6) and IL-10 were both highly expressed in spleen and lung of YNSA7 and YNSA53 dead cases compared with YNSA53 survived and YNSA163 cases, which demonstrated cytokine storm pattern for CA-MRSA strains infection. The results of IL-6 intervention experiment verified that the enhanced IL-6 secretion was responsible for the host lethality of YNSA7 infection. RNA-sequencing results among three MRSA isolates indicated most of the differentially expressed genes referred to cellular process, metabolism and genetic information processing of bacteria. Specifically, clpP, chp chemotaxis inhibit, fnbB, pathogencity island protein and virulence associated protein E were highly expressed in YNSA7 strain. In general, CA-MRSA strains provoked cytokine storm on BALB/c mice led to severe infection and lethality, the up-regulated of some virulence genes might play important role in pathogenesis.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemotaxis 3adeath 3aexudation 3agene expression regulation 3ahistopathology 3ainterleukin-10 3ainterleukin-6 3akidneys 3alungs 3ametabolism 3amethicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus 3apathogenesis 3apathogens 3asecretion 3asequence analysis 3aspleen 3avirulence 0aHospital-acquired 0aCommunity-acquired 0aCytokine storm 0aRNA-sequencing1 aGu, Wenpeng1 aFu, Xiaoqing1 aYuan, Bin1 aZhang, Yunhui1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0645-94830 tMolecular immunology.g2021 Dec., v. 140 p.167-174dElsevier LtdwJournal:12510x0161-58907nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.molimm.2021.10.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03220naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245012100170300001600291520200100307592002802308650001402336650002402350650001202374650001402386650000902400650002602409650001402435650001402449650002102463650001602484650001002500650001702510650001502527650001102542650001602553650002402569700002202593700002002615773009402635856004802729852000902777655001202786IND50064120720221118001025.0130325e201305  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006412072DNAL7 a10.1007/s10682-012-9608-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFischbein, Deborah10aLinking reproductive and feeding strategies in the parasitoid Ibalia leucospoides: does feeding always imply profit?  ap. 619-634.  aResource acquisition and allocation to different biological functions over the course of life have strong implications for animal reproductive success. Animals can experience different environmental conditions during their lifetime, and this may play an important role in shaping their life-history and resource allocation strategies. In this study we investigate larval and adult resource allocation to reproductive and survival functions in the parasitoid wasp Ibalia leucospoides (family Ibaliidae). The pattern of larval resource allocation was inferred from the relationship between adult body size and ovigeny index (OI; a relative measure of investment in early reproduction determined as the ratio between the initial egg load and the potential lifetime fecundity); and adult resource allocation was explored through the influence of adult feeding on reproduction, maintenance and metabolism, in laboratory experiments. Food acquisition by this parasitoid in the wild was also examined. The relationship between size and OI was constant, suggesting no differential resource allocation to initial egg load and potential lifetime fecundity with size. This finding is in line with that predicted by adaptive models for the proovigenic egg maturation strategy (OI = 1). Despite of this, I. leucospoides showed a high OI of 0.77, which places this species among the weakly synovigenic ones (OI < 1). Adult feeding had no effect on post-emergence egg maturation. However, wasps extended their lifespan through feeding albeit only when food was provided ad libitum. Although the information we obtained on the feeding behaviour of free-foraging wasps is limited, our results suggest that food intake in the wild, while possible, may not be frequent in this parasitoid. We discuss the results relative to the environmental factors, such as reproductive opportunities and food availability, which may have driven the evolution of larval and adult pattern of resource allocation in parasitoids.  aPublisher supplied data 3aIbaliidae 3aanimal reproduction 3aanimals 3abody size 3aeggs 3aenvironmental factors 3aevolution 3afecundity 3afeeding behavior 3afood intake 3afoods 3alife history 3ametabolism 3amodels 3aparasitoids 3aresource allocation1 aBernstein, Carlos1 aCorley, Juan C.0 tEvolutionary ecology.g2013 May, v. 27, no. 3 p.619-634dSpringer-Verlagx0269-76537nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10682-012-9608-9  aDNAL 7aarticle02671naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002400150245007900174300001600253520116000269592002801429650001901457650001401476650002101490650002601511650001301537650001001550650001601560650001201576650001601588650002601604653001501630653002201645653002401667653002201691653002801713653002301741653002401764700002201788700001501810700002001825700001701845700001701862700002601879700001501905700002101920700001601941773009001957856008502047852000902132655001202141IND60688289120221119210409.0200614e20200830xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068828912DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbon.2020.04.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRehman, Malik Abdul10aSolar cell based on vertical graphene nano hills directly grown on silicon  ap. 235-243.  aWe demonstrate a solar cell application based on vertical graphene nano hills (VGNH) directly grown without using a catalyst. The photovoltaic device based on VGNH grown on top of interfacial layer Al₂O₃ is compared with that on top of bare silicon by critically analyzing its electrical properties. The role of the interfacial layer is to minimize surface recombination and enhance its built-in potential. Our key process is simple to fabricate large-area devices, avoiding an unreliable transfer process. In addition, the thickness of VGNH is optimized and the surface texturing of silicon is performed to overcome the crucial problem of the high reflectivity of silicon. A low reflectivity of thick layers of VGNH is achieved with low series resistance despite of the vertical structure, which is beneficial for high photocurrent. A higher work function of VGNH ∼4.7 eV is measured by KPFM. The conversion efficiency of 10.97% is achieved with an active area of 0.9 cm² by co-doping with PEDOT: PSS and inorganic acid HNO₃. Moreover, the photo-responsivity of the VGNH-based device is estimated as 1.196 AW⁻¹ under deep ultraviolet light.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaluminum oxide 3acatalysts 3aelectric current 3aelectrical properties 3agraphene 3ahills 3anitric acid 3asilicon 3asolar cells 3aultraviolet radiation 0aSolar cell 0aVertical graphene 0aGraphene nano hills 0aSchottky junction 0aDirectly grown graphene 0aGraphene co-doping 0aTextured substrate.1 aRoy, Sanjib Baran1 aGwak, Dham1 aAkhtar, Imtisal1 aNasir, Naila1 aKumar, Sunil1 aKhan, Muhammad Farooq1 aHeo, Kwang1 aChun, Seung-Hyun1 aSeo, Yongho0 tCarbon.g2020 Aug. 30, v. 164 p.235-243dElsevier LtdwJournal:11670x0008-62237nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbon.2020.04.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03430naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024005000092040001800142100002400160245009900184300001600283500000900299500001500308520214700323592002802470650001802498650001002516650002702526650002402553650002802577650002302605650001602628650001902644650001002663650001102673651001202684653002502696700001702721700002002738700002202758773012202780852000902902856009702911655001203008IND9002970620221120230030.0191122e199003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND900297062DNAL7 a10.2134/agronj1990.00021962008200020019x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSollenberger, L.

The objective of this research was to determine the effect of defoliation prior to harvesting stems for vegetative planting on number of shoots produced, percentage of planted stems producing shoots, and shoot and root dry matter (DM) accumulation during 6 wk postplant. Responses were quantified for mid- and late summer planting dates in 2 yr on a Smyrna sand (sandy, siliceous, hyperthermic Aeric Haplapuods). heviously undefoliated plants were (i) grazed to remove 70 to 90% of leaf blade (grazed), (ii) grazed to remove the apical meristem and leaf blade of individual stems (meristem), (iii) not grazed, but leaf blades were stripped manually from stems (stripped), (iv) not grazed, but all herbage above the collar of the most recentlj expanded leaf was clipped manually (topped), or (v) not defoliated (undefoliated). More shoots emerged per row from undefoliated stems than from all other treatments except topped. Defoliation had no effect on percentage of planted stems that produced at least one shoot. Shoot DM was greater for undefoliated than for all but stripped stems, and root DM was greatest for undefoliated stems. Stems from the meristem treatment initiated shoot but not root growth during the first 2 wk postplant, and shoot and root DM production was low through 6 wk. Undefoliated stems produced little shoot DM by 2 wk, but root growth started soon after planting. Root and shoot growth responses were consistent with theories regarding apical dominance and auxin effects on early plant development from stem cuttings. Results suggest that successful establishment of Mott elephantgrass is most likely if undefoliated stems are planted. Contribution from the Dep. Agronomy, IFAS, Univ. of Ronda, Gainesville, FL 32611.

In Brazil, the most important species is Leishmania infantum. In the northern region, the state of Pará is notable, with a high number of cases reported in recent years. The second largest number of cases of human visceral leishmaniasis in the region in recent years has been reported in the city of Marabá (Pará state). We investigated the prevalence of L. infantum in domestic dogs from Marabá in Amazon region in Brazil. Materials and Methods: A total of 400 blood samples were tested using the dual-path platform chromatographic immunoassay (DPP® CVL—Bio-Manguinhos), and molecular diagnosis based in cathepsin L-like gene, which has better specificity and sensitivity than other similar tests. Results: The prevalence of L. infantum was 75.5% (302/400) in the serological test, and 59.25% (237/400) in molecular diagnosis, and 45.5% (182/400) in both tests. Interpretation and Conclusion: The results confirmed that the parasite L. infantum was prevalent in the dog population of the studied region and adoption of appropriate public policies are urgently needed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLeishmania infantum 3ablood 3acathepsin L 3achromatography 3adeforestation 3adogs 3aecosystems 3agenes 3ahumans 3aimmunoassays 3aparasites 3avisceral leishmaniasis 3aAmazonia 3aBrazil 0aphlebotomine 0aepidemiology 0aPCR1 aSilva, Ryan Emiliano da1 aAzevedo, Roberta Carvalho de Freitas e1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8212-97691 aPesenato, Isabella Pereira1 aCarioca, Ana Carolina Fernandes1 aAlves, Bruna Farias1 aCastelli, Giovanna Stefani Nosberto1 aOnofrio, Valeria Castilho1 aMarcili, Arlei0 tVector borne and zoonotic diseases.g2022 Feb. 01, v. 22, no. 2 p.108-113dMary Ann Liebert, Inc.wJournal:J000000160x1557-77597nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1089/vbz.2021.00673Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02384naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002900149245005100178500002200229520122500251592002801476650003201504650000801536650002301544650001201567650002701579650001801606650001401624650001601638650002101654650001401675650002701689650001801716650002201734650002401756650001101780700002401791773006701815856008301882852000901965655001201974IND60528743720221119125453.0160716s2016    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052874372DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ydbio.2016.06.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBuendía-Monreal, Manuel10aMediator: A key regulator of plant development  aPre-press version  aMediator is a multiprotein complex that regulates transcription at the level of RNA pol II assembly, as well as through regulation of chromatin architecture, RNA processing and recruitment of epigenetic marks. Though its modular structure is conserved in eukaryotes, its subunit composition has diverged during evolution and varies in response to environmental and tissue-specific inputs, suggesting different functions for each subunit and/or Mediator conformation. In animals, Mediator has been implicated in the control of differentiation and morphogenesis through modulation of numerous signaling pathways. In plants, studies have revealed roles for Mediator in regulation of cell division, cell fate and organogenesis, as well as developmental timing and hormone responses. We begin this review with an overview of biochemical mechanisms of yeast and animal Mediator that are likely to be conserved in all eukaryotes, as well as a brief discussion of the role of Mediator in animal development. We then present a comprehensive review of studies of the role of Mediator in plant development. Finally, we point to important questions for future research on the role of Mediator as a master coordinator of development.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA-directed RNA polymerase 3aRNA 3aanimal development 3aanimals 3abiochemical mechanisms 3acell division 3achromatin 3aepigenetics 3aeukaryotic cells 3aevolution 3amultiprotein complexes 3aorganogenesis 3aplant development 3asignal transduction 3ayeasts1 aGillmor, C.

However, not everyone is in a position to prevent or mitigate damages incurred by a flood event. Thus, while flood-related costs are determined through economic assessments, there are social dimensions to property protection that will impact the actual damages incurred. To incorporate these additional dimensions, an index is developed to identify areas of increased social vulnerability in relation to pre- and post-flood warning preparation to mitigate property damage and facilitate evacuation. Education level, income, age, and familial dependencies are considered as contributors to potential social vulnerability of residents to respond to immediate pre-emergency flood preparation, and these are integrated with technical damage calculations to provide greater context for flood management planning. A case study application to the Credit River basin in southwestern Ontario is used to demonstrate the methodology. Analyses demonstrate that in this example application, the areas most prone to financial damages are also those where people are potentially more socially vulnerable, and indicate that total damages may be far greater in these areas than physical and monetary damages alone.  aPublisher supplied data 3abags 3acase studies 3aeducational status 3aflood control 3agates 3aincome 3aplanning 3arivers 3asand 3awatersheds 3aOntario1 aMurray, StevenJ.1 aMcBean, EdwardA.0 tWater resources management.g2018 July, v. 32, no. 9 p.3175-3187dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl44305x0920-47417nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11269-018-1983-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02157naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245011000171300001800281520082600299592002801125650001401153650001601167650001501183650002101198650001901219650001301238650001401251653001101265653001301276653001001289653002701299700001601326700001701342700001601359700001701375700001501392700001601407700001801423700001901441773015601460856008601616852000901702655001201711IND60539322120221117224423.0190215e20150708xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053932212DNAL7 a10.1016/j.febslet.2015.04.0612doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXing, Chong-yun10aLong non-coding RNA HOTAIR modulates c-KIT expression through sponging miR-193a in acute myeloid leukemia  ap. 1981-1987.  aHOTAIR is significantly overexpressed in various cancers and facilitates tumor invasion and metastasis. However, whether HOTAIR plays oncogenic roles in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is still unknown. Here, we report that HOTAIR expression was obviously increased in leukemic cell lines and primary AML blasts. Clinically, AML patients with higher HOTAIR predicted worse clinical outcome compared with those with lower HOTAIR. Importantly, HOTAIR knockdown by small hairpin RNA inhibited cell growth, induced apoptosis, and decreased number of colony formation. Finally, HOTAIR modulated c-KIT expression by competitively binding miR-193a. Collectively, our data suggest that HOTAIR plays an important oncogenic role in AML and might serve as a marker for AML prognosis and a potential target for therapeutic intervention.  aPublisher supplied data 3aapoptosis 3acell growth 3ametastasis 3amyeloid leukemia 3anon-coding RNA 3apatients 3aprognosis 0aHOTAIR 0amiR-193a 0ac-KIT 0aAcute myeloid leukemia1 aHu, Xiao-qu1 aXie, Fei-yan1 aYu, Zhi-jie1 aLi, Hai-ying1 aBin-Zhou, 1 aWu, Jian-bo1 aTang, Li-yuan1 aGao, Shen-meng0 tFEBS letters.g2015 July 08, v. 589, no. 15 p.1981-1987dElsevier B.V.aFederation of European Biochemical SocietieswJournal:jnl16404x0014-57937nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.febslet.2015.04.0613Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01274naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094024002100127024001900148040001800167100002100185245006000206300001200266506007600278520028400354592002800638506003700666650001600703650001000719650001100729650002900740773010300769856007900872852000900951655001200960IND60119502620221207090909.0141214e200402  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011950262DNAL7 a10.1186/gb-2004-5-3-2122doi7 aPMC3957572pmcid7 a150031102pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGepstein, Shimon10aLeaf senescence - not just a 'wear and tear' phenomenon  ap. 728.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aA recent, genome-wide study shows that the transcriptional program underlying leaf senescence is active and complex, reflecting the activation of more than 2,000 genes in Arabidopsis, with gene products involved in a broad spectrum of regulatory, biochemical and cellular events.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aArabidopsis 3agenes 3aleaves 3atranscription (genetics)0 tGenome biology.g2004 Feb., v. 5, no. 3 p.728-728dSpringer-VerlagwJournal:19127x1474-760X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/gb-2004-5-3-2123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03505naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094024002200127024001900149040001800168100001900186245010400205300001600309506007600325520180900401592002802210596004402238596003002282596004402312506003702356650005302393650001402446650002102460650001302481650000802494650001402502650001402516650002402530650002402554650001002578653002402588653001402612653001002626653001802636653001102654653001602665653002302681653001702704700002202721773014302743856008002886852000902966655001202975IND60621549320221207103822.0181203e20170101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062154932DNAL7 a10.3945/ajcn.116.1438262doi7 aPMC51837342pmcid7 a279035212pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKant, Ashima K12aA prospective study of water intake and subsequent risk of all-cause mortality in a national cohort  ap. 212-220.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBackground: Water, an essential nutrient, is believed to be related to a variety of health outcomes. Published studies have examined the association of fluid or beverage intake with risk of mortality from coronary diseases, diabetes, or cancer, but few studies have examined the association of total water intake with all-cause mortality. Objective: We examined prospective risk of mortality from all causes in relation to intakes of total water and each of the 3 water sources. Design: We used public-domain, mortality-linked water intake data from the NHANES conducted in 1988–1994 and 1999–2004 for this prospective cohort study (n = 12,660 women and 12,050 men; aged ≥25 y). Mortality follow-up was completed through 31 December 2011. We used sex-specific Cox proportional hazards regression methods that were appropriate for complex surveys to examine the independent associations of plain water, beverage water, water in foods, and total water with multiple covariate–adjusted risk of mortality from all causes. Results: Over a median of 11.4 y of follow-up, 3504 men and 3032 women died of any cause in this cohort. In men, neither total water intake nor each of the individual water source variables (plain water, water in beverages, and water in foods) was independently related with risk of all-cause mortality. In women, risk of mortality increased slightly in the highest quartile of total or plain water intake but did not approach the Bonferroni-corrected level of significance of P < 0.002. Conclusions: There was no survival advantage in association with higher total or plain water intake in men or women in this national cohort. The slight increase in risk of mortality noted in women with higher total and plain water intakes may be spurious and requires further investigation.  aPublisher supplied data  cDepartment of Health and Human Services  cNational Cancer Institute  cNIHdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/1000000020 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aNational Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 3abeverages 3acoronary disease 3adiabetes 3amen 3amortality 3aneoplasms 3aprospective studies 3aregression analysis 3awomen 0aall-cause mortality 0abeverages 0afluid 0afood moisture 0aNHANES 0aplain water 0aprospective cohort 0awater intake1 aGraubard, Barry I0 tAmerican journal of clinical nutrition.g2017 Jan. 01, v. 105, no. 1 p.212-220dOxford University PresswJournal:jnl45206x1938-32077nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3945/ajcn.116.1438263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01332naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002200151245010000173520035700273592002800630650001400658650001400672650001100686653000800697653000800705653003400713653002400747653002400771653003000795773009800825856008600923852000901009655001201018IND60755245020221116155241.0211213e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075524502DNAL7 a10.1016/j.econlet.2021.1101362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTakahashi, Shuhei14aThe uniqueness of steady-state equilibrium under state-dependent pricing: The case of deflation  aJohn and Wolman (2004, 2008) show that steady-state equilibrium is likely to be unique under inflation (i.e., a positive net inflation rate) in a New Keynesian state-dependent pricing model based on the Dotsey et al.

The nitrogen-deplete period was divided into two stages based on the photosynthetic parameters. During the first stage, carbon assimilation was not reduced compared with that under favorable conditions. The marked increase in triacylglycerols and the variation in the fatty acid profile suggested that triacylglycerols were mainly derived from de novo synthesized acyl groups. In the second stage, the triacylglycerol content continued increasing while the carbohydrate content decreased from 44.0% to 26.3%. These results indicated that the intracellular conversion of carbohydrates to triacylglycerols occurred. Thus, we propose that sustainable carbon assimilation and incremental triacylglycerol production can be achieved by supplying appropriate amounts of nitrogen in medium to protect the photosynthetic process from severe damage using the photosynthetic parameters as indicators.  aPublisher supplied data 3aIsochrysis 3acarbohydrate content 3acarbohydrates 3acarbon dioxide fixation 3afatty acid composition 3amicroalgae 3anitrogen 3aphotosynthesis 3astarvation 3atriacylglycerols 0aIsochrysis zhangjiangensis 0aPhotosynthesis 0aTriacylglycerols production 0aNitrogen limitation1 aMeng, Ying-Ying1 aCao, Xu-Peng1 aAi, Jiang-Ning1 aZhou, Jian-Nan1 aXue, Song1 aWang, Weiliang,0 tBioresource technology.g2015 Feb., v. 177 p.282-288dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46263x0960-85247nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2014.11.0283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02504naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002000152245012500172300001400297520142100311592002801732650004401760650001701804650001301821650001401834650001801848650002001866650001101886650001701897650001601914700002201930700001901952773008801971856008602059852000902145655001202154IND60095480320221120141144.0141104e20120305xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009548032DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfa.2012.01.0202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRudolph, Martin12aA TGA–FTIR perspective of fatty acid adsorbed on magnetite nanoparticles–Decomposition steps and magnetite reduction  ap. 16-23.  aThe fatty acid stabilization of magnetite nanoparticles is important for a broad field of studies and applications. In numerous previous studies TGA analyses are applied to investigate these compounds and draw conclusions such as magnetite concentration and surface grafting densities of the chemisorbed molecules. There are however deviations in interpretation of the analysis results. In the presented work we contribute to the discussion on the inert gas decomposition of the fatty acid ricinoleic acid adsorbed on the surface of magnetite nanoparticles with a priori knowledge of magnetite concentration. We report on impacts of autoxidation of the fatty acid as well as significant reduction of magnetite from carbonaceous residues. The findings are based on subsequent gas analysis with FTIR coupled to the TG device. We show how stoichiometric calculations on the reduction in the temperature range of 600–900°C let conclude that the residues are most probably from the chemisorbed fatty acid molecules. Only the physically adsorbed fatty acid molecules have decomposed or detached before 600°C. In context to the investigations on chemically adsorbed fatty acid on magnetite we compare the decomposition of pristine fatty acid and fatty acid physically adsorbed on a high surface area SiO₂ nanopowder. Three distinct steps of decomposition which have often been reported before are found and accounted.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aautoxidation 3acolloids 3amagnetite 3ananoparticles 3aricinoleic acid 3asilica 3asurface area 3atemperature1 aErler, Jacqueline1 aPeuker, Urs A.0 tColloids and surfaces.g2012 Mar. 5, v. 397 p.16-23dElsevier B.V.x0927-77577nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfa.2012.01.0203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02406naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006500148245009600213300001800309520083400327592002801161650002401189650001301213650002301226650002301249650002701272650001601299650001801315650001501333650001301348650000901361650002101370651001001391700005901401700005901460700007201519700003501591700002101626700003201647700005901679773013001738856008301868852000901951655001201960IND60739438520221120075341.0210731e202106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073943852DNAL7 a10.1007/s10811-021-02400-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNorsker, Niels-Henrik1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9783-957910aNeochloris oleoabundans oil production in an outdoor tubular photobioreactor at pilot scale  ap. 1327-1339.  aOil production was tested with Neochloris oleoabundans in a 6 m³, horizontal soft sleeve tubular reactor from 22 October to 7 November in Matalascañas, southern Spain.

By applying the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT), we assessed the effects of land use changes on major hydrologic processes (evapotranspiration (ET), discharge, river) on a large plain irrigation district, the Hetao Irrigation District (HID), China. The results indicated that SWAT was a useful tool for simulating the effects of land use changes on regional hydrologic processes. Human activities were the main factors that directly influenced land use in the HID. Land use changes had important impacts on the hydrologic processes of the HID. During 1995–2010, the land use changed greatly in the HID, leading to the changes in ET and discharge. The peak value of ET coincided with the exuberant crop growth period in the maximized sown crop area. In 1995s, wheat maximized the sown area and ET peaked in June; when sunflower and corn maximized the sown area in 2010s, ET peaked in July and August. The increased ET reduced discharge in the same period in the HID. Land use change affected the period and quantity of water diversion in the irrigation district. The quantity of water diverted in 1995 was greater than that in 2010, indicating that land use change significantly impacted the water quantity of the river, which was the water source of the irrigation district. This study will be a reference for future land use planning and water resource management in the irrigation district.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHelianthus annuus 3aSoil and Water Assessment Tool model 3aanthropogenic activities 3acorn 3aevapotranspiration 3airrigation 3aland use change 3aland use planning 3arivers 3awater management 3awater quantity 3awatersheds 3awheat 3aChina1 aWu, Pu-Te1 aSun, Shi-Kun1http://orcid.org/0000-0002-8368-17661 aLi, Xiao-Lei1 aWang, Yu-Bao1 aGao, Xue-Rui0 tWater resources management.g2018 July, v. 32, no. 9 p.3203-3217dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl44305x0920-47417nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11269-018-1986-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03260naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094024002100127024001900148040001800167100002200185245014700207300001200354506007600366520172400442592002802166506003702194650002102231650002702252650001902279650001002298650001102308650002102319650001802340650002102358650001002379650001102389650001902400650002902419650001402448650002602462650001102488700001802499700002002517700002102537700001702558773010302575856007902678852000902757655001202766IND60119503320221207090908.0141214e200402  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011950332DNAL7 a10.1186/gb-2004-5-3-r152doi7 aPMC3957652pmcid7 a150031182pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSheps, Jonathan A14aThe ABC transporter gene family of Caenorhabditis elegans has implications for the evolutionary dynamics of multidrug resistance in eukaryotes  ap. 819.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Many drugs of natural origin are hydrophobic and can pass through cell membranes. Hydrophobic molecules must be susceptible to active efflux systems if they are to be maintained at lower concentrations in cells than in their environment. Multi-drug resistance (MDR), often mediated by intrinsic membrane proteins that couple energy to drug efflux, provides this function. All eukaryotic genomes encode several gene families capable of encoding MDR functions, among which the ABC transporters are the largest. The number of candidate MDR genes means that study of the drug-resistance properties of an organism cannot be effectively carried out without taking a genomic perspective. RESULTS: We have annotated sequences for all 60 ABC transporters from the Caenorhabditis elegans genome, and performed a phylogenetic analysis of these along with the 49 human, 30 yeast, and 57 fly ABC transporters currently available in GenBank. Classification according to a unified nomenclature is presented. Comparison between genomes reveals much gene duplication and loss, and surprisingly little orthology among analogous genes. Proteins capable of conferring MDR are found in several distinct subfamilies and are likely to have arisen independently multiple times. CONCLUSIONS: ABC transporter evolution fits a pattern expected from a process termed 'dynamic-coherence'. This is an unusual result for such a highly conserved gene family as this one, present in all domains of cellular life. Mechanistically, this may result from the broad substrate specificity of some ABC proteins, which both reduces selection against gene loss, and leads to the facile sorting of functions among paralogs following gene duplication.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aABC transporters 3aCaenorhabditis elegans 3acell membranes 3adrugs 3aenergy 3aeukaryotic cells 3agene deletion 3agene duplication 3agenes 3ahumans 3ahydrophobicity 3amultiple drug resistance 3aphylogeny 3asubstrate specificity 3ayeasts1 aRalph, Steven1 aZhao, Zhongying1 aBaillie, David L1 aLing, Victor0 tGenome biology.g2004 Feb., v. 5, no. 3 p.819-819dSpringer-VerlagwJournal:19127x1474-760X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/gb-2004-5-3-r153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02527naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024005000092040001800142100003800160245010800198300001600306500000900322520132200331592002801653650001601681650001901697650001701716650002301733650001301756650001401769650001501783650001501798650003701813650002901850700002401879700002201903773012201925852000902047856009702056655001202153IND9002971220221121004604.0191122e199003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND900297122DNAL7 a10.2134/agronj1990.00021962008200020025x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBethlenfalvay, G.

The Diagnosis and Recommendation Integrated Syslem (DRIS) may serve this purpose, and an analysis of mycorrhiza-mediated nutrient-uptake effects on soybean [Glycine max L.) M'err. CY. Hobbit) plants by DRIS is presented. Plants were grown either colonized by one of three geographical isolates of the VAM fungus Glomus mosseae (Nicol & Gerd) Gerd and Trappe or as nonVAM controls in a nutrient-deficient soil. Plant development and nutritional status differed among the treatments. Analysis by DWS confirmed that N, P, and K were limiting, and established different rankings in the degree of deficiency for each nutrient. Nitrogen was least limiting in all four treatments and K or P were most limiting in each of two treatments. The analysis permitted a ranking of the G. mosseae isolates as to their effects on the uptake of each nutrienl. Evaluation of VAM-mediated nutrientuptake effects by DRIS and by nutrient-dilution and concentration analyses could become useful in the selection of specific VAM fungal isolates for their specific crop responses.

The reaction-diffusion theory first proposed by Alan Turing states that the initial symmetry in embryos can be broken by the interplay between two diffusible molecules, whose interactions lead to the formation of patterns. The reaction-diffusion theory provides a valuable framework for self-organized pattern formation, but it has been difficult to relate simple two-component models to real biological systems with multiple interacting molecular species. Recent studies have addressed this shortcoming and extended the reaction-diffusion theory to realistic multi-component networks. These efforts have challenged the generality of previous central tenets derived from the analysis of simplified systems and guide the way to a new understanding of self-organizing processes. Here, we discuss the challenges in modeling multi-component reaction-diffusion systems and how these have recently been addressed. We present a synthesis of new pattern formation mechanisms derived from these analyses, and we highlight the significance of reaction-diffusion principles for developmental and synthetic pattern formation.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aadults 3aembryogenesis 3amodels1 aJordan, Benjamin M.1 aDiego, Xavier1 aMuller, Patrick,0 tDevelopmental biology.g2020 Apr. 01, v. 460, no. 1 p.2-11dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12382x0012-16067nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ydbio.2019.10.0313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02725naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001900139245013500158300001600293500002000309520141400329592002801743596002301771596003401794596005501828650001301883650001201896650001501908650001401923650001101937650001301948650002401961651002601985651002002011700006302031700002402094773012602118856007402244852000902318655001202327IND60779020720221117203832.0220603e202206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077902072DNAL7 a10.1111/aje.129532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMavah, Germain10aEmpty laws and empty forests: Reconsidering rights and governance for sustainable wildlife management in the Republic of the Congo  ap. 212-221.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aLike their ancestors, forest dwellers in the Republic of the Congo depend heavily on bushmeat for their livelihoods. National regulations and enforcement are ineffective, yet undermine indigenous institutions. In common with many forest communities globally, this is creating an open‐access resource at the same time that demand for bushmeat is increased by roads, towns, markets and new harvesting technology (guns, wire). We argue that the intractability and contradictions of the bushmeat problem globally reflect outdated institutions of exclusionary conservation and that the disempowerment of local people can be framed as an ‘empty laws’ open‐access syndrome in which neither national nor local controls are working. We propose that this is an institutional predicament that needs to be resolved by re‐establishing local tenure and rights, and drawing on the commons literature, New Institutional Economics and the long experience with private and community wildlife in southern Africa to design alternative governance regimes. In proposing measures to re‐build local commons (private‐community ownership), this review highlights community rights, the controversial issue of commercial use and markets, and the substantial advantages of participatory face‐to‐face community governance relative to the representational committee‐based governance associated with development projects.  aPublisher supplied data  cRufford Foundation  cWildlife Conservation Society  cUnited States Agency for International Development 3abushmeat 3aforests 3agovernance 3aownership 3apeople 3awildlife 3awildlife management 3aRepublic of the Congo 3aSouthern Africa1 aChild, B.q(Brian),1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0532-21271 aSwisher, Marilyn E.0 tAfrican journal of ecology.g2022 June, v. 60, no. 2 p.212-221dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl31087x0141-67077nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/aje.129533Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03145naa a2200757 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094024002200131024001900153040001800172100001900190245010700209500002200316506007600338520083700414592002801251506003701279650001801316650001201334650002801346650001501374650001201389650003901401650001501440650001701455653002701472653002501499653001501524653002901539653002501568700002401593700002401617700001801641700002701659700001901686700001501705700002201720700003201742700001901774700002601793700002201819700002301841700001901864700001901883700002401902700002601926700002501952700001701977700001801994700002302012700002102035700001902056700001502075700002202090700002202112700002402134700001802158700001402176700002602190773006702216856008302283852000902366655001202375IND60528744220221207111123.0160716s2016    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052874422DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ydbio.2016.04.0012doi7 aPMC50268752pmcid7 a270598832pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBurns, Alan J.10aWhite paper on guidelines concerning enteric nervous system stem cell therapy for enteric neuropathies  aPre-press version  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aOver the last 20 years, there has been increasing focus on the development of novel stem cell based therapies for the treatment of disorders and diseases affecting the enteric nervous system (ENS) of the gastrointestinal tract (so-called enteric neuropathies).

This White Paper sets out experts’ views on the commonly used methods and approaches to identify, isolate, purify, expand and optimize ENS stem cells, transplant them into the bowel, and assess transplant success, including restoration of gut function.

Moth, and Effects of Piperidine Alkaloids on Preference and Performance  ap. 607-615.  aIncludes references  aConium maculatum L. (Apiaceae), or poison hemlock, is an invasive plant native to Europe that has become extensively naturalized throughout North America. This species contains piperidine alkaloids, including coniine and γ-coniceine, that are highly toxic to vertebrates. C. maculatum was relatively free from herbivores in North America until the accidental introduction 30 yr ago of its monophagous European associate Agonopterix alstroemeriana (Clerck) (Lepidoptera: Oecophoridae). At present, A. alstroemeriana is widespread across the United States, and in some areas, such as the Northwest, can inflict substantial damage on its host plant, leading to desiccation and death. A. alstroemeriana has been used in recent years for the biological control of C. maculatum, although its use has been limited by the availability of larvae, which are field-collected from early to mid-spring, and by the lack of available information about its life history and feeding habits. Here we describe a laboratory-rearing protocol incorporating a simulated winter to induce diapause and a semidefined artificial diet that allows the production of multiple generations per year and enabled us to determine the number and duration of A. alstroemeriana developmental stages. The development of the artificial diet also permitted studies of preference and performance of A. alstroemeriana in relation to hostplant chemistry. Rearing A. alstroemeriana on artificial diet supplemented with 1.5% DW coniine had no adverse impact on ultimate instar growth or performance. In a feeding behavior assay, the presence of coniine in the diet increased A. alstroemeriana consumption three-fold relative to control diet. This behavioral response contrasts dramatically with that of Agonopterix clemensella, a native Apiaceae specialist that does not use C. maculatum as a host; of 30 larvae tested, 29 fed exclusively on diets lacking supplemental coniine. The rearing protocol and artificial diet presented here can facilitate further studies of ecological and evolutionary responses of C. maculatum after its reassociation with a coevolved herbivore in North America. 3aAgonopterix alstroemeriana 3ainsect rearing 3aartificial diets 3afood plants 3aConium maculatum 3achemical constituents of plants 3apiperidine alkaloids 3afeeding preferences 3ainsect growth 3ainsect development 3adevelopmental stages 3anoxious weeds 3abiological control agents 0aconiine 0agamma-coniceine 0aAgonopterix clemensella1 aBerenbaum, M.R.0 tEnvironmental entomology.g2006 June, v. 35, no. 3 p.607-615dEntomological Society of America.x0046-225X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.entsoc.org/pubs/periodicals/ee/index.htm3electronic resource40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1603/0046-225X-35.3.6073Available from publisher's Web site  a20060910b20061003c00000000  aINDdNZMe2006/09/05  aOther US 7aarticle02212naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002300140245013000163300002000293520101600313592002801329650002301357650002801380650001301408650001401421650001901435650002601454650001301480650002401493650001301517650002001530650001601550650001701566700001701583700001901600773012401619856007401743852000901817655001201826IND60641058720221122033753.0190505e20160808xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064105872DNAL7 a10.1039/c6ra16126j2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAltinbasak, Ismail10aBest of both worlds: Diels–Alder chemistry towards fabrication of redox-responsive degradable hydrogels for protein release  ap. 74757-74764.  aPoly(ethylene glycol)-based redox-responsive hydrogels have been prepared via the Diels–Alder reaction between a furan-containing hydrophilic copolymer and a disulfide-containing bis-maleimide based crosslinker. Hydrogels containing varying amounts of the crosslinker were synthesized with 71–82% yield under mild and benign conditions. Variation in the redox-responsive crosslinker density allows tuning of their mechanical properties and their stability under a reducing environment. It was observed that increase in the amount of crosslinker decreases water uptake and reduces porosity of the hydrogels. Using rheological analysis it was deduced that an increase in temperature and crosslinker density speeds the gelation process and the presence of thiol-containing reducing agents leads to their degradation. Notably, the extent of protein release from these hydrogels could be tailored by varying the amount of redox-responsive disulfide moieties incorporated as crosslinkers during their fabrication.  aPublisher supplied data 3acomposite polymers 3acycloaddition reactions 3agelation 3ahydrogels 3ahydrophilicity 3amechanical properties 3amoieties 3apolyethylene glycol 3aporosity 3areducing agents 3atemperature 3awater uptake1 aSanyal, Rana1 aSanyal, Amitav0 tRSC advances.g2016 Aug. 08, v. 6, no. 78 p.74757-74764dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c6ra16126j3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02294naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002400148245014800172520114700320592002801467650001101495650001201506650001301518650001401531650001601545653001301561653001501574653002801589653001301617653001501630700002401645700001901669700002801688773012401716856008301840852000901923655001201932IND60755245620221116155009.0220124e202201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075524562DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jaap.2021.1053612doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAl-Awadi, Sundus A.10aGas-phase thermolysis of azines.

The ten substrates were then subjected to: (i) flow flash vacuum pyrolysis (FVP) at 700 °C and short (ms) contact time; (ii) static sealed-tube pyrolysis (STP) at temperatures in the range of 300–380 °C, and relatively longer substrate residence time of 15–60 min. The products of thermolysis were analyzed, identified, characterized and compared. Further, the kinetics of pyrolysis was investigated over the temperature range ca 550–620 K and 500–615 K, respectively, for substrates (1a,c,e) and (2a,c,e). Rates, Arrhenius log A and Ea, and entropy of activation (∆S≠) were calculated. The nature and composition of the products of pyrolysis were ascertained, and substrate molecular reactivities were adequately explained based on plausible reaction mechanisms, and further rationalized using known effects of common substituent groups and specific nitrogen replacement (N =) substituents.  aPublisher supplied data 3aazines 3aentropy 3anitrogen 3apyrolysis 3atemperature 0aKinetics 0aMechanisms 0aArylidenazinylhydrazine 0aPyrazine 0aPyramidine1 aAl-Awadi, Nouria A.1 aDib, Hicham H.1 aEl-Dusouqui, Osman M.E.0 tJournal of analytical and applied pyrolysis.g2022 Jan., v. 161 p.105361-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6382x0165-23707nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jaap.2021.1053613Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02084naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002800151245008500179300001800264520097700282592002801259650002601287650001101313650001701324650002001341650001301361653001401374653003701388653000901425653001001434653001001444700002901454773015601483856008601639852000901725655001201734IND60539322920221117224459.0190215e20150622xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053932292DNAL7 a10.1016/j.febslet.2015.05.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMüller, Amelie Johanna10aFunction of human WIPI proteins in autophagosomal rejuvenation of endomembranes?  ap. 1546-1551.  aDespite the availability of a large pool of experimental approaches and hypothetical considerations, the hunt for the enigmatic membrane origin of autophagosomes is still on. In mammalian cells proposed scenarios for the formation of the autophagosomal membrane include both de novo assembly, and rearrangements plus maturation of pre-existing membrane sections from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), plasma membrane, Golgi or mitochondria. Earlier, we identified the human WD-repeat protein interacting with phosphoinositides (WIPI) family and showed that WIPI proteins function as essential phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PtdIns3P) effectors at the nascent autophagosome. Interestingly, WIPI proteins localize to both pre-existing endomembranes and nascent autophagosomes. In this context, and on the basis of historical records on the formation of autophagosomes, we discuss with appropriate modesty an alternative perspective on the membrane origin of autophagosomes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aendoplasmic reticulum 3ahumans 3amitochondria 3aplasma membrane 3aproteins 0aAutophagy 0aPhosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate 0aWIPI 0aWIPI1 0aWIPI21 aProikas-Cezanne, Tassula0 tFEBS letters.g2015 June 22, v. 589, no. 14 p.1546-1551dElsevier B.V.aFederation of European Biochemical SocietieswJournal:jnl16404x0014-57937nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.febslet.2015.05.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02497naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245014400169300001600313520084900329592002801178650002101206650002601227650001601253650003001269650002501299650001301324650001301337650002401350650001701374650001701391650002201408650002801430650002101458650001601479650002601495650001901521650001801540650002301558650001601581650000901597653000901606653001301615653002001628653002501648653002701673700001701700700001901717773012901736856008101865852000901946655001201955IND60540085920221118211740.0190318e201509  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054008592DNAL7 a10.1016/j.lwt.2015.03.0302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCheng, Siang-Ying10aAntioxidant and antimicrobial edible zein/chitosan composite films fabricated by incorporation of phenolic compounds and dicarboxylic acids  ap. 115-121.  aEdible films and coatings can not only function as barriers of water vapor, gases and volatile compounds but also serve as carriers of functional ingredients.

For the purposes of this study, monitoring was taking place at six sites along the river course. Discharge measurements were made at four stations. Physicochemical parameters (i.e., electrical conductivity, pH, dissolved oxygen and water temperature) were measured in situ while water quality samples were collected on a bi-weekly basis at all six stations along the river. Water samples for chemical analyses were collected for the determination of total phosphorus, orthophosphate, nitrite and nitrate nitrogen, ammonia, biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), chemical oxygen demand (COD), chlorophyll-a, TSS, alkalinity, sulfuric and chloride anions, major cations (Na⁺, K⁺, Mg⁺, Ca⁺) and metals. Two autographic telemetric stations also provided continuous stage and water quality data at two of the sites. ANOVA and t-test statistical analysis were used for the interpretation of the collected data. Nutrient concentrations were found within acceptable limits, while bicarbonates were the dominant ions. No significant seasonal and spatial variations were observed, suggesting little impact from human activities on the part of river basin under investigation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalkalinity 3aammonia 3aanalysis of variance 3aanions 3abicarbonates 3abiochemical oxygen demand 3acalcium 3acations 3achemical analysis 3achemical oxygen demand 3achlorophyll 3adissolved oxygen 3aelectrical conductivity 3ahumans 3amonitoring 3anitrate nitrogen 3anutrient content 3aorthophosphates 3aphosphorus 3apotassium 3arivers 3asodium 3asurveys 3at-test 3awater quality 3awater quantity 3awater temperature 3awatersheds 2aChlorophyllxanalysis 2aEnvironmental Monitoringxmethods 2aMetals, Heavyxanalysis 2aRivers 2aWater Pollutants, Chemicalxanalysis 3aGreece 0aGreece 0aNestos river 0amonitoring 0anutrients 0aheavy metals 0achlorophyll-a 0aANOVA 0at-test1 aGikas, Georgios D.1 aSylaios, Georgios1 aTsihrintzis, Vassilios A.0 tJournal of environmental science and health.g2011 Aug. 1, v. 46, no. 10 p.1050-1067dTaylor & Francis Groupx1532-41177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10934529.2011.590381  aDNAL 7aarticle02999naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094024002200121024001900143040001800162100001900180245016100199506007600360520129300436592002801729506003701757650001901794650001301813650001601826650001601842650002101858650001001879650001601889650001301905650002301918650001501941650001001956650001901966650000901985650001201994650002802006650001802034650001102052650002502063650002702088650001402115650001602129700001702145700001702162700001702179700001802196700001502214773012202229856007302351852000902424655001202433IND60650065920221207101248.0190709e20161002xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065006592DNAL7 a10.3390/nu81006152doi7 aPMC50840032pmcid7 a277060952pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTan, Chengquan10aSoluble Fiber with High Water-Binding Capacity, Swelling Capacity, and Fermentability Reduces Food Intake by Promoting Satiety Rather Than Satiation in Rats  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aTo understand whether soluble fiber (SF) with high water-binding capacity (WBC), swelling capacity (SC) and fermentability reduces food intake and whether it does so by promoting satiety or satiation or both, we investigated the effects of different SFs with these properties on the food intake in rats. Thirty-two male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomized to four equal groups and fed the control diet or diet containing 2% konjac flour (KF), pregelatinized waxy maize starch (PWMS) plus guar gum (PG), and PWMS starch plus xanthan gum (PX) for three weeks, with the measured values of SF, WBC, and SC in the four diets following the order of PG > KF > PX > control. Food intake, body weight, meal pattern, behavioral satiety sequence, and short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) in cecal content were evaluated. KF and PG groups reduced the food intake, mainly due to the decreased feeding behavior and increased satiety, as indicated by decreased meal numbers and increased inter-meal intervals. Additionally, KF and PG groups increased concentrations of acetate acid, propionate acid, and SCFAs in the cecal contents. Our results indicate that SF with high WBC, SC, and fermentability reduces food intake—probably by promoting a feeling of satiety in rats to decrease their feeding behavior.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAmorphophallus 3aacetates 3abody weight 3acorn starch 3afeeding behavior 3aflour 3afood intake 3aguar gum 3alaboratory animals 3aleukocytes 3amales 3apropionic acid 3arats 3asatiety 3ashort chain fatty acids 3asoluble fiber 3astarch 3aswelling (materials) 3awater binding capacity 3awaxy corn 3axanthan gum1 aWei, Hongkui1 aZhao, Xichen1 aXu, Chuanhui1 aZhou, Yuanfei1 aPeng, Jian0 tNutrients.g2016 Oct. 02, v. 8, no. 10dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2271x2072-66437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu81006153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02586naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245005900168300001600227520131800243592002801561650003501589650001601624650002401640650002501664650001601689650003701705650001601742650001701758650002101775650002801796650001001824700002001834700002101854700002201875700002001897700002201917700002801939773010701967856008102074852000902155655001202164IND60133396920221123002820.0150520e201506  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013339692DNAL7 a10.1007/s00438-014-0957-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPetrarulo, Maria10aGenetic analysis of root morphological traits in wheat  ap. 785-806.  aTraits related to root architecture are of great importance for yield performance of crop species, although they remain poorly understood. The present study is aimed at identifying the genomic regions involved in the control of root morphological traits in durum wheat (Triticum durum Desf.). A set of 123 recombinant inbred lines derived from the durum wheat cross of cvs. ‘Creso’ × ‘Pedroso’ were grown hydroponically to two growth stages, and were phenotypically evaluated for a number of root traits. In addition, meta-(M)QTL analysis was performed that considered the results of other root traits studies in wheat, to compare with the ‘Creso’ × ‘Pedroso’ cross and to increase the QTL detection power. Eight quantitative trait loci (QTL) for traits related to root morphology were identified on chromosomes 1A, 1B, 2A, 3A, 6A and 6B in the ‘Creso’ × ‘Pedroso’ segregating population. Twenty-two MQTL that comprised from two to six individual QTL that had widely varying confidence intervals were found on 14 chromosomes. The data from the present study provide a detailed analysis of the genetic basis of morphological root traits in wheat. This study of the ‘Creso’ × ‘Pedroso’ durum-wheat population has revealed some QTL that had not been previously identified.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTriticum turgidum subsp. durum 3achromosomes 3aconfidence interval 3adevelopmental stages 3adurum wheat 3agenetic techniques and protocols 3ahydroponics 3ainbred lines 3aplant morphology 3aquantitative trait loci 3aroots1 aMarone, Daniela1 aFerragonio, Pina1 aCattivelli, Luigi1 aRubiales, Diego1 aDe Vita, Pasquale1 aMastrangelo, Anna Maria0 tMolecular genetics and genomics.g2015 June, v. 290, no. 3 p.785-806dSpringer-Verlagx1617-46157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00438-014-0957-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02890naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002300140245008500163520147000248592002801718650003401746650001701780650003101797650001601828650001301844650001801857650001301875650001801888650001801906650002501924650002801949650002601977700001802003700001802021700002002039700002002059700002102079700001902100700002802119700002402147700002202171700001802193773012602211856007402337852000902411655001202420IND60732132520221120190641.0210326e20210228xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073213252DNAL7 a10.3390/md190301352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSusano, Patrícia 10aUnravelling the Dermatological Potential of the Brown Seaweed Carpomitra costata  aThe ever-increasing interest in keeping a young appearance and healthy skin has leveraged the skincare industry. This, coupled together with the increased concern regarding the safety of synthetic products, has boosted the demand for new and safer natural ingredients. Accordingly, the aim of this study was to evaluate the dermatological potential of the brown seaweed Carpomitra costata. The antioxidant, anti-enzymatic, antimicrobial, photoprotective and anti-inflammatory properties of five C. costata fractions (F1–F5) were evaluated. The ethyl acetate fraction (F3) demonstrated the most promising results, with the best ability to scavenge 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radicals (EC₅₀ of 140.1 µg/mL) and the capacity to reduce reactive oxygen species (ROS) production promoted by UVA and UVB radiation in 3T3 cells, revealing its antioxidant and photoprotective potential. This fraction also exhibited the highest anti-enzymatic capacity, inhibiting the activities of collagenase, elastase and tyrosinase (IC₅₀ of 7.2, 4.8 and 85.9 µg/mL, respectively). Moreover, F3 showed anti-inflammatory potential, reducing TNF-α and IL-6 release induced by LPS treatment in RAW 264.7 cells. These bioactivities may be related to the presence of phenolic compounds, such as phlorotannins, as demonstrated by NMR analysis. The results highlight the potential of C. costata as a source of bioactive ingredients for further dermatological applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3a2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl 3aPhaeophyceae 3aanti-inflammatory activity 3acollagenase 3aelastase 3aethyl acetate 3aindustry 3ainterleukin-6 3aphlorotannins 3aradiation resistance 3areactive oxygen species 3aultraviolet radiation1 aSilva, Joana 1 aAlves, Celso 1 aMartins, Alice 1 aGaspar, Helena 1 aPinteus, Susete 1 aMouga, Teresa 1 aGoettert, Márcia  Ines1 aPetrovski, Željko 1 aBranco, Luís  B.1 aPedrosa, Rui 0 tMarine drugs.g2021 Feb. 28, v. 19, no. 3dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21403x1660-33977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/md190301353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02608naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245008600166300001400252520124500266592002801511650001101539650001501550650001401565650001801579650002301597650002201620650001601642650001001658650001501668650003101683653002801714653001101742653001301753653001001766653001501776700002101791700002001812700002001832700002801852700002101880700002001901773012701921856008102048852000902129655001202138IND60540086020221118211842.0190318e201509  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054008602DNAL7 a10.1016/j.lwt.2015.03.0312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFarneti, Brian10aDynamic volatile organic compound fingerprinting of apple fruit during processing  ap. 21-28.  aThe aroma profile in apple was investigated during artificial processing operated with a device imitating the human consumption. The system, composed by a “chewing device” coupled with a Proton Transfer Reaction – Time of Flight-Mass Spectrometry (PTR-ToF-MS), allowed an accurate dynamic volatile organic compound (VOC) fingerprinting suitable to study the volatile kinetics of three apple cultivars (‘Golden Delicious’, ‘Fuji’, and ‘Granny Smith’) during shelf-life ripening.The obtained results demonstrate the complementarity between the dynamic VOC assessment during “mastication” and the usual static headspace analysis. The great advantage of such analytical approach was the possibility to study the kinetics of the volatiles released during eating and the possibility to consider their concentration similar to in vivo condition resulting to an improved characterization of the aroma profile. Moreover, differences in textural properties of apple flesh revealed a possible direct role of the cell wall architectural structure in the regulation of VOC release during consumption. This strategy may be ideal for VOC assessment addressed to investigate fruit quality aspects impacting the consumer appreciation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aapples 3acell walls 3acultivars 3afruit quality 3aheadspace analysis 3amass spectrometry 3amastication 3aodors 3ashelf life 3avolatile organic compounds 0aMalus x domestica Borkh 0aEsters 0aAlcohols 0aAroma 0aPTR-ToF-MS1 aKhomenko, Iuliia1 aCappellin, Luca1 aTing, Valentina1 aCosta, G.q(Guglielmo),1 aBiasioli, Franco1 aCosta, Fabrizio0 tLebensmittel-Wissenschaft + Technologie.g2015 Sept., v. 63, no. 1 p.21-28dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl1644x0023-64387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lwt.2015.03.0313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01739naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002600140245008700166520057200253592002800825650002300853650002200876650002500898650001700923650003600940650001600976650002200992650002201014700002001036700002101056700001901077700002001096700001901116700002101135773012601156856007401282852000901356655001201365IND60732132620221120190602.0210326e20210228xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073213262DNAL7 a10.3390/md190301362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuỳnh, Thanh Hảo,10a8-Hydroxybriaranes from Octocoral Briareum stechei (Briareidae) (Kükenthal, 1908)  aChemical investigation of the octocoral Briareum stechei, collected in the Ie Island, Okinawa, Japan, resulted in the isolation of a new briarane-type diterpenoid, briastecholide A (1), as well as the previously reported metabolites, solenolide C (2) and briarenolide S (3).

Isolation and concentration of the compounds was by solid-phase extraction. The different factors affecting extraction efficiency – packing composition, pH, clean-up, ionic strength, and elution solvents – were studied and optimized. With the proposed method C₄–C₁₃SPC and C₁₀–C₁₃LAS recoveries varied between 65% and 105%, with standard deviations between 0.1 and 5, respectively, for 100-mL samples and 100 µg L–¹concentrations of each homolog. Detection limits within the range 0.5 g L–¹(for C₄SPC) to 1.0 g L–¹(for C₁₂SPC) were obtained by liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection. This method is the first to be proposed that enables the simultaneous determination of monocarboxylic SPC (C>3) and LAS homologs in marine samples by a simple, sensitive, and specific method giving high recoveries and reproducibility. SPC with from three to twelve carbon atoms in the carboxyl chain have been found in marine water samples.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacids 3abiodegradation 3acarbon 3adetection limit 3afluorescence 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3aionic strength 3apH 3asolid phase extraction 3asolvents 3asulfonates1 aGómez-Parra, A.1 aGonzález-Mazo, E.0 tFresenius' journal of analytical chemistry.g2001 Oct., v. 371, no. 4 p.479-485dSpringer-Verlagx0937-06337nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s0021601010463Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02702naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245004500170300001600215520121800231592002801449650001301477650001401490650001101504650001101515650001901526650001901545650001001564650001101574650001101585650001201596650002201608650001201630650002601642650001001668650001301678650001201691650001401703650001301717650001201730650002301742650001001765653001601775653002201791653001401813653002001827653002101847700003101868700003001899773012901929856008102058852000902139655001202148IND60540086120221118211927.0190318e201509  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054008612DNAL7 a10.1016/j.lwt.2015.03.0322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPacyński, Mariusz10aImproving the aroma of gluten-free bread  ap. 706-713.  aGluten-free bread (GF) is different from wheat (W) or wheat–rye bread (WR) in terms of its sensory qualities, possessing not only a barely acceptable texture but also a weak aroma. A total of 77 volatile compounds, including alcohols, aldehydes, ketones, pyrazines, furans, pyrroles, and others, were detected bin the crust and crumb of the analyzed samples using GC/MS. A total of 41 volatile compounds were identified in the W bread, 54 in the WR bread, and 33 in the GF bread. It was found that the most important feature of gluten-free bread flavor is its lack of key bread compounds, specifically pyrazines and 2-acetyl-1-pyrroline. The addition of different amino acid and sugar pairs to the dough prior to baking made these deficiencies lower and, in the case of the proline and glucose pair, this was achieved to a sufficient degree. Multivariate analysis of data from chromatograph ratings of volatile compounds showed the similarity of samples with the addition of this pair of precursors (proline and glucose) to wheat bread, just like PCA in sensory profiling. For the consumer group consisting of patients with celiac disease the aroma of such gluten-free bread was more desirable than control one.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalcohols 3aaldehydes 3abaking 3abreads 3aceliac disease 3achromatography 3adough 3aflavor 3afurans 3aglucose 3agluten-free foods 3aketones 3amultivariate analysis 3aodors 3apatients 3aproline 3apyrazines 3apyrroles 3atexture 3avolatile compounds 3awheat 0aBread aroma 0aGluten-free bread 0aVolatiles 0aSensory quality 0aAroma precursors1 aWojtasiak, Renata Zawirska1 aMildner-Szkudlarz, Sylwia0 tLebensmittel-Wissenschaft + Technologie.g2015 Sept., v. 63, no. 1 p.706-713dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl1644x0023-64387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lwt.2015.03.0323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03275naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004900094040001800143100002100161245006500182300001600247500000900263520180500272592002802077650001902105650002302124650002502147650002002172650002302192650001302215650002402228650001502252650001202267650000902279650000902288650000902297650001902306650001502325650001402340650001102354650001902365650001602384650002002400650002002420650001702440650001902457650001502476700001402491773014702505856009602652852000902748655001202757IND60669656920221119020437.0191125e198805  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066965692DNAL7 a10.2136/sssaj1988.03615995005200030030x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShipitalo, M. J.10aFactors Influencing the Dispersibility of Clay in Worm Casts  ap. 764-769.  aepub  aEarthworm activity is believed to be beneficial for the maintenance of good soil structure; however, some research suggests that it promotes soil degradation. Factors affecting the contribution of casting activity to aggregate stability were assessed by measuring clay dispersibility in casts produced by Lumbricus terrestris L. and Lumbricus rubellus Hoff. in laboratory cultures when provided alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.), bromegrass (Bromus inermis Leyss.), red colver (Trifolium pratense L.), or corn (Zea mays L.) leaves or no food. Fresh, moist casts were 26 to 41% more dispersible than uningested, moist soil. Aging reduced dispersibility of moist casts produced under alfalfa, red clover, and corn leaf diets and after 32 d casts were 26% more to 16% less dispersible than uningested, moist soil. Casts aged moist and analyzed after air drying were unaffected by aging but were 9% more to 49% less dispersible than uningested, dried soil. The effects of aging and drying increased as cast organic carbon content increased, therefore L. rubellus casts, which contained more incorporated organic matter than those of L. terrestris, were less dispersible than L. terrestris casts for most treatments. The initial dispersibility increase was due to interparticle bond disruption caused by ingestion and peristalsis. Restoration and improvement in stability was probably due to thixotropic hardening and bonding of clay with incorporated organic debris. Because fresh worm casts are highly dispersible, surface casting activity in areas exposed to raindrop impact may contribute to soil erosion and crusting. Casting activity should enhance soil aggregate stability if casts are aged or dried before being subject to dispersion.

A wide range of extraction temperatures from 140 to 290 °C was used to evaluate the release of proteins and amino acids. The amount of crude protein was the highest (36.14 ± 1.39 mg bovine serum albumin/g) at 200 °C, whereas a further increase in temperature showed the degradation of the crude protein content. The highest amount of amino acids (74.80 mg/g) was at 230 °C, indicating that the temperature range of 170–230 °C is suitable for the extraction of protein-rich compounds using subcritical water hydrolysis. Molecular weights of the peptides obtained from comb penshell viscera decreased with the increasing temperature. SDS-PAGE revealed that the molecular weight of peptides present in the hydrolysates above the 200 °C extraction temperature was ≤ 1000 Da. Radical scavenging activities were analyzed to evaluate the antioxidant activities of the hydrolysates. A. pectinata hydrolysates also showed a particularly good antihypertensive activity, proving that this raw material can be an effective source of amino acids and marine bioactive peptides.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAtrina pectinata 3aamino acids 3aantihypertensive effect 3aantioxidants 3abovine serum albumin 3acrude protein 3ahydrolysis 3amolecular weight 3apeptides 3apolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 3araw materials 3atemperature1 aRoy, Vikash  Chandra1 aHo, Truc  Cong1 aPark, Jin-Seok 1 aJeong, Yu-Rin 1 aLee, Seung-Chan 1 aKim, Sung-Yeol 1 aChun, Byung-Soo 0 tMarine drugs.g2021 Mar. 01, v. 19, no. 3dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21403x1660-33977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/md190301373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01764naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094024002200130024001900152040001800171100001700189245006200206300001600268506007600284520038100360592002800741506003700769650001500806650003100821650001900852650001400871650001700885650002700902653002700929653002100956653001800977653001300995653002901008700001901037700001501056700005201071773011601123856008201239852000901321655001201330IND60633135720221207104423.0190319e201903  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063313572DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tibs.2018.09.0072doi7 aPMC63791422pmcid7 a302972062pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShi, Junchao10atsRNAs: The Swiss Army Knife for Translational Regulation  ap. 185-189.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  atRNA-derived small RNAs (tsRNAs, or tRFs) are a new category of regulatory noncoding RNAs with versatile functions.

The loss of a carnivore guild's dominant species can therefore provide considerable insights. We evaluated spotted hyaena density and demography from Zambia's Liuwa Plain National Park, a recovering ecosystem where the hyaena's main competitor, the African lion, was severely reduced to 3–5 animals. Using data from 233 individuals in five clans and mark-resight robust design models we estimated population size, density, age and sex-specific annual survival rates for the hyaena population from 2010 to 2013 and tested for the effect of human settlements, prey density, competition with lions and hyaena clan size on mean hyaena survival. We estimated a minimum density of 0.13 hyaenas/km2 and maximum density of 0.52 hyaenas/km2. Density fluctuated with seasonal migrations of the main prey species, the blue wildebeest. Mean annual survival across all age classes was 0.93 (95%CI: 0.79–0.99). With high survival rates across all sex and age classes, we found no detectable effects of ecological or anthropogenic factors on survival. These results suggest that the combination of abundant prey, weak human-carnivore conflict, and weak competition from lions provide very favourable conditions for hyaena survival. Additional investigations of hyaena demography concurrent with lion population recovery efforts can provide considerable insights into the dynamics of carnivore competition and predation in African savannahs and the human and ecological factors affecting them.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCrocuta crocuta 3aPanthera leo 3aage structure 3acarnivores 3ademography 3aecosystems 3ahuman settlements 3ahumans 3ainterspecific competition 3anational parks 3anatural resources conservation 3apopulation size 3apredation 3asavannas 3asurvival rate 3awildebeest 3aZambia 0aSpotted hyena 0aAfrican lion 0aSurvival 0aRobust design 0aAnthropogenic effects 0aIntraguild competition1 aCreel, Scott1 aBecker, Matthew S.1 aDroge, Egil0 tBiological conservation.g2016 Sept., v. 201 p.348-355dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl44607x0006-32077nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biocon.2016.07.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02381naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002000145245006300165300001600228520105400244592002801298650001901326650001501345650002601360650002001386650001001406650001601416650001501432650001901447650003701466650001401503650001401517650001301531650001501544653001701559653002701576653002401603700002401627700002601651700001701677773015301694856007901847852000901926655001201935IND60523150020221117011428.0160605e20140602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052315002DNAL7 a10.1515/znc-2012-9-10042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aArisoy, Mustafa10aSynthesis and Antimicrobial Activity of Novel Benzoxazoles  ap. 466-472.  aA series of 2-(p-substituted-benzyl)-5-[[4-(p-chloro/fluoro-phenyl)piperazin-1-yl]ace tamido] -benzoxazoles were synthesized in need of new compounds for the fight against microbial pathogens. Their structures were elucidated by spectral techniques. These new derivatives, along with previously synthesized 2-(p-substituted-benzyl)-5-substituted-benzoxazoles, were evaluated for their antibacterial and antifungal activities against standard strains and drugresistant isolates in comparison with ampicillin, gentamicin sulfate, ofloxacin, vancomycin, fluconazole, and amphotericin B trihydrate. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of each compound was determined by a two-fold serial dilution technique. The compounds were found to possess a broad spectrum of antimicrobial activities with MIC values of 32 - 256 μg/ml. Although standard drugs were more active against the pathogenes employed in this study, the activities of the new benzoxazoles and reference drugs against drug-resistant isolates of the microorganisms were largely similar  aPublisher supplied data 3aamphotericin B 3aampicillin 3aantifungal properties 3adrug resistance 3adrugs 3afluconazole 3agentamicin 3amicroorganisms 3aminimum inhibitory concentration 3aofloxacin 3apathogens 3asulfates 3avancomycin 0aBenzoxazoles 0aAntibacterial Activity 0aAntifungal Activity1 aTemiz-Arpaci, Ozlem1 aKaynak-Onurdag, Fatma1 aOzgen, Selda0 tZeitschrift für Naturforschung.g2014 June 2, v. 67, no. 9-10 p.466-472dVerlag der Zeitschrift für NaturforschungwJournal:23183x1865-71257nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1515/znc-2012-9-10043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03537naa a2200649 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094024002200121024001900143040001800162100003600180245014700216506007600363520145300439592002801892506003701920650002001957650002601977650001802003650001902021650002502040650002502065650002502090650001702115650002702132650002402159650002402183650002402207650001902231650001102250650001302261650001602274650002802290650001402318650002302332650001002355650001802365650002102383650001002404650001302414650001402427650001402441650000902455700004502464700003102509700003602540700002302576700002202599700001702621700003302638773012202671856007302793852000902866655001202875IND60650066420221207101245.0190709e20161004xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065006642DNAL7 a10.3390/nu81006072doi7 aPMC50839952pmcid7 a277820422pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGonzález-Ponce, Herson Antonio10aHepatoprotective Effect of <em>Opuntia robusta</em> and <em>Opuntia streptacantha</em> Fruits against Acetaminophen-Induced Acute Liver Damage  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aAcetaminophen (APAP)-induced acute liver failure (ALF) is a serious health problem in developed countries. N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC), the current therapy for APAP-induced ALF, is not always effective, and liver transplantation is often needed. Opuntia spp. fruits are an important source of nutrients and contain high levels of bioactive compounds, including antioxidants. The aim of this study was to evaluate the hepatoprotective effect of Opuntia robusta and Opuntia streptacantha extracts against APAP-induced ALF. In addition, we analyzed the antioxidant activities of these extracts. Fruit extracts (800mg/kg/day, orally) were given prophylactically to male Wistar rats before intoxication with APAP (500 mg/kg, intraperitoneally). Rat hepatocyte cultures were exposed to 20mmol/LAPAP, and necrosis was assessed by LDH leakage. Opuntia robusta had signiﬁcantly higher levels of antioxidants than Opuntia streptacantha. Both extracts signiﬁcantly attenuated APAP-induced injury markers AST, ALT and ALP and improved liver histology. The Opuntia extracts reversed APAP-induced depletion of liver GSH and glycogen stores. In cultured hepatocytes, Opuntia extracts signiﬁcantly reduced leakage of LDH and cell necrosis, both prophylactically and therapeutically. Both extracts appeared to be superior to NAC when used therapeutically. We conclude that Opuntia extracts are hepatoprotective and can be used as a nutraceutical to prevent ALF.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aOpuntia robusta 3aOpuntia streptacantha 3aacetaminophen 3aacetylcysteine 3aalanine transaminase 3aalkaline phosphatase 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3aaspartate transaminase 3abioactive compounds 3adeveloped countries 3adietary supplements 3afruit extracts 3afruits 3aglycogen 3ahepatocytes 3ahepatoprotective effect 3ahistology 3alaboratory animals 3aliver 3aliver failure 3aliver transplant 3amales 3anecrosis 3anutrients 3apoisoning 3arats1 aMartínez Saldaña, María Consolación,1 aRincón-Sánchez, Ana Rosa1 aSumaya-Martínez, María Teresa1 aBuist-Homan, Manon1 aFaber, Klaas Nico1 aMoshage, Han1 aJaramillo Juárez, Fernando,0 tNutrients.g2016 Oct. 04, v. 8, no. 10dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2271x2072-66437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu81006073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03851naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002400148245009800172300001200270520222100282592002802503596005702531596004002588650001102628650001802639650000902657650001202666650001902678650001402697650001902711650002402730650001002754650001002764650001302774650003002787650001102817650001702828650003102845650001402876650001202890650001802902650001702920650001202937650001802949650002402967700002902991700002903020700001903049700002003068773011703088856008303205852000903288655001203297IND60712576520221117205643.0210731e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071257652DNAL7 a10.1186/s12917-020-02493-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPrpar Mihevc, Sonja10aNeural differentiation of canine mesenchymal stem cells/multipotent mesenchymal stromal cells  ap. 282.  aBACKGROUND: The ability of adipose tissue-derived multipotent mesenchymal stromal cells/mesenchymal stem cells (ASCs) to differentiate in neural lineages promises progress in the field of regenerative medicine, especially for replacing neuronal tissue damaged by different neurological disorders. Reprogramming of ASCs can be induced by the growth medium with neurogenic inductors and specific growth factors. We investigated the neural differentiation potential of canine ASCs using several growth media (KEM, NIMa, NIMb, NIMc) containing various combinations of neurogenic inductors: B27 supplement, valproic acid, forskolin, N2-supplement, and retinoic acid. Cells were first preconditioned in the pre-differentiation neural induction medium (mitogenically stimulated; STIM1), followed by the induction of neuronal differentiation. RESULTS: After 3, 6, and 9 days of neural induction, elongated neural-like cells with bipolar elongations were observed, and some oval cells with light nuclei appeared. The expression of neuronal markers tubulin beta III (TUBB3), neurofilament H (NF-H), microtubule-associated protein-2 (MAP2), and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) was observed using immunocytochemistry, which confirmed the differentiation into neurons and glial cells. Flow cytometry analysis showed high GFAP expression (between 70 and 90% of all cells) after cells had been growing three days in the neural induction medium a (NIMa). Around 25% of all cells also expressed adult neuronal markers NF-H and MAP2. After nine days of ASCs differentiation, the expression of all neural markers was reduced. There were no differences between the neural differentiation of ASCs isolated from female or male dogs. CONCLUSIONS: The differentiation repertoire of canine ASCs extends beyond mesodermal lineages. Using a defined neural induction medium, the canine ASCs differentiated into neural lineages and expressed markers of neuronal and glial cells, and also displayed the typical neuronal morphology. Differentiated ASCs can thus be a source of neural cellular lineages for the regenerative therapy of nerve damage and could be useful in the future for therapy or the modelling of neurodegenerative diseases.  aPublisher supplied data  aP4-0053cJavna Agencija za Raziskovalno Dejavnost RS  aGrant for SPMcEuropean Social Fund 3aadults 3aculture media 3adogs 3afemales 3aflow cytometry 3aforskolin 3agrowth factors 3aimmunocytochemistry 3alight 3amales 3amedicine 3amesenchymal stromal cells 3amodels 3anerve tissue 3aneurodegenerative diseases 3aneuroglia 3aneurons 3aretinoic acid 3atherapeutics 3atubulin 3avalproic acid 3aveterinary medicine1 aKokondoska Grgich, Vesna1 aKopitar, Andreja Nataša1 aMohorič, Luka1 aMajdič, Gregor0 tBMC veterinary research.g2020 Dec., v. 16, no. 1 p.282-282dBioMed CentralwJournal:jnl4152735x1746-61487nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12917-020-02493-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03015naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004900094040001800143100001900161245006000180300001800240500000900258520180000267592002802067650004402095650001502139650001102154650002202165650001402187650001702201650001302218650000902231650001602240650001202256650002302268650003702291650001102328700002302339773015002362856009602512852000902608655001202617IND60669657320221119020324.0191125e198911  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066965732DNAL7 a10.2136/sssaj1989.03615995005300060010x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKung, King-Hsi10aAdsorption of Para-substituted Benzoates on Iron Oxides  ap. 1673-1678.  aepub  aIn order to understand the binding mechanism and adsorptivity of benzoic acids on Fe oxides, adsorption of parasubstituted amino, nitro, methyl, methoxy, and chlorobenzoic acids onto noncrystalline Fe hydroxide and goethite from aqueous solution and vapor state was studied. Adsorption on noncrystalline Fe hydroxide from solution phase was quantified by the determination of adsorption isotherms using UV spectrometry to measure the concentration of unadsorbed organic. Adsorption of the benzoic acids from the vapor phase was further studied, using Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) of self-supported goethite films to identify the binding mechanism and relative bond strength of the organic anion-oxide complex. Results showed that the higher the pKa of the benzoic acid (i.e., the smaller the Hammett Constant of the substituent) the more readily the organic was adsorbed from solution. From FTIR study, an inner-sphere coordination of the carboxylate anion to surface Fe involving a ligand exchange process was identified. Quantity of adsorption from solution was correlated to surface Fe-benzoate bond strength as deduced from FTIR of dry oxide films, with bond strengths of para-substituted benzoate following the order: amino > methoxy > methyl > chloro > nitro. Bidentate coordination was deduced to be the binding mechanism for chemisorption on air-dry surfaces; however, physical adsorption was also identified in the absence of competing anions. It is concluded that electron-with-drawing groups on the aromatic ring weaken the carboxylate bond to surface Fe atoms by withdrawing electron density from the carboxylate group. Conversely, electron-donating groups increase adsorption by increasing the electron density of the carboxylate, strengthening its Lewis basicity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aadsorption 3aanions 3aaqueous solutions 3abenzoates 3abenzoic acid 3agoethite 3airon 3airon oxides 3aligands 3asorption isotherms 3aultraviolet-visible spectroscopy 3avapors1 aMcBride, Murray B.0 tSoil Science Society of America journal.g1989 Nov., v. 53, no. 6 p.1673-1678dSoil Science Society of AmericawJournal:jnl44580x0361-59957nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2136/sssaj1989.03615995005300060010x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01774naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001800145245006900163300001600232520055600248592002800804650001900832650002600851650002600877650001800903650001000921650001600931650004800947650003700995653002601032653003201058653002401090700002301114700002201137773015301159856007901312852000901391655001201400IND60523150320221117011118.0160605e20140602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052315032DNAL7 a10.1515/znc-2012-9-10072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGöker, Hakan10aPotent Antifungal and Antistaphylococcal 2-Anilinobenzimidazoles  ap. 486-494.  aA series of 21 anilinobenzimidazoles with a 2,4-difluorophenyl group were synthesized and their minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) determined by the tube dilution method.

The determination of sulfite serves as a first example of its application. The method is based on the diffusional separation of SO₂ following in-line oxidation with hydrogen peroxide to sulfate and final determination of the sulfate formed using IC. The influence of operational parameters has been thoroughly investigated and gas-diffusion cells of different geometries compared with respect to the gas-transfer rates obtained.

Mitral regurgitation is markedly sensitive to afterload alterations. The purpose of this study was to evaluate muscular arterial impedance in dogs with chronic degenerative mitral valve disease (CDMVD) by use of duplex Doppler ultrasonography (DDU), since its technique there was not used before to determine impedance index in dogs with CDMVD. For this purpose, ten healthy dogs and ten dogs with CDMVD were used. Some parameters related to blood flow impedance in the common femoral artery were measured by DDU: pulsatility index (PI), resistance index (RI), high-resistance index (HRI), and acceleration velocity (AC) and deceleration velocity (DC) of the systolic peak. The results showed that RI and HRI were significantly higher in animals with CDMVD than in healthy animals. These findings showed that DDU provides quantitative data related to vascular impedance. Broader studies may therefore provide new aspects related to physiopathology and therapy in CDMVD patients.  aPublisher supplied data 3apathophysiology 3adogs 3atherapeutics 3aanimal health 3ablood flow 3apatients 3aultrasonography 2aAnimals 2aDog Diseasesxpathology 2aDogs 2aFemale 2aMale 2aMitral Valve Prolapsexpathologyxveterinary. 2aMuscle, Skeletalxblood supplyxphysiology. 2aVascular Resistancexphysiology 0aimpedance1 aSilva, A.C.1 aReis, G.F.M.1 aMuzzi, R.A.L.1 aMantovani, M.M.0 tResearch in veterinary science.g2012 Dec., v. 93, no. 3 p.1434-1438dElsevier India Pvt Ltd.x0034-52887nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rvsc.2012.07.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02684naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245017300171300001400344520148800358592002801846650001001874650001901884650001501903650001801918650001501936650002301951650001501974653001601989653004002005653001402045653002002059700002502079700002802104773008402132856008502216852000902301655001202310IND60633136320221119182618.0190325e201905  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063313632DNAL7 a10.1016/j.micron.2019.01.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVenkatesh, Vijay10aSurface-tracked scanning ion conductance microscopy: A novel imaging technique for measuring topography-correlated transmembrane ion transport through porous substrates  ap. 57-65.  aIon transport through porous substrates is ubiquitous in biological and synthetic materials, and fundamental for chemical separation, drug delivery and bio-sensing. Contemporary imaging techniques for simultaneously characterizing topography and ion transport through porous substrates are limited in range and resolution. In this paper, we demonstrate ‘surface-tracked scanning ion conductance microscopy’ as a technique to image topography of a porous substrate and simultaneously measure voltage-driven transmembrane ion transport. This technique uses the principles of ‘shear-force tracking’ to image the surface of a polycarbonate track-etch membrane, and chronoamperometry to reconstruct topography-correlated transmembrane ion transport through the membrane at different transmembrane potentials. Spatial transmembrane transport through individual pores is modeled using Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz (GHK) theory to examine the effects of shear-force modulation on magnitude of transmembrane currents recorded with a nanopipette. The modeled transmembrane current through the porous membrane is compared with experimental behavior, and discrepancies between predicted values and measured data are outlined. The proposed surface-tracked imaging mode allows for rapid assessment (approximately 7 s/μm2) of interfacial processes at the nanoscale and addresses a bottleneck for stable, large-area characterization of porous substrates using scanning ion conductance microscopy.  aPublisher supplied data 3adrugs 3aimage analysis 3amicroscopy 3arapid methods 3aseparation 3asynthetic products 3atopography 0aShear-force 0aScanning ion conductance microscopy 0aGHK model 0aPorous membrane1 aHeinemann, Christian1 aSundaresan, Vishnu Baba0 tMicron.g2019 May, v. 120 p.57-65dElsevier LtdwJournal:12416x0968-43287nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.micron.2019.01.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02362naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002800140245009500168500001400263520126000277592002801537650001801565650001801583650001301601650001001614650001601624650001601640650002301656650001501679650000901694650002001703650001201723650001401735650001201749650001001761773012201771856007401893852000901967655001201976IND60729374320221118041742.0210228e20210130xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072937432DNAL7 a10.3390/nu130204672doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMalbert, Charles-Henri 10aVagally Mediated Gut-Brain Relationships in Appetite Control-Insights from Porcine Studies  aNAL-light  aSignals arising from the upper part of the gut are essential for the regulation of food intake, particularly satiation. This information is supplied to the brain partly by vagal nervous afferents. The porcine model, because of its sizeable gyrencephalic brain, omnivorous regimen, and comparative anatomy of the proximal part of the gut to that of humans, has provided several important insights relating to the relevance of vagally mediated gut-brain relationships to the regulation of food intake. Furthermore, its large size combined with the capacity to become obese while overeating a western diet makes it a pivotal addition to existing murine models, especially for translational studies relating to obesity. How gastric, proximal intestinal, and portal information relating to meal arrival and transit are encoded by vagal afferents and their further processing by primary and secondary brain projections are reviewed. Their peripheral and central plasticities in the context of obesity are emphasized. We also present recent insights derived from chronic stimulation of the abdominal vagi with specific reference to the modulation of mesolimbic structures and their role in the restoration of insulin sensitivity in the obese miniature pig model.  aPublisher supplied data 3aWestern diets 3aanimal models 3aappetite 3abrain 3afood intake 3ainformation 3ainsulin resistance 3aintestines 3amice 3aminiature swine 3aobesity 3aomnivores 3asatiety 3aswine0 tNutrients.g2021 Jan. 30, v. 13, no. 2dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2271x2072-66437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu130204673Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02567naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002100140245011100161520132800272592002801600650002601628650001201654650002501666650001601691650004401707700002101751700002001772700002301792700002001815700002901835700002301864700002101887700002001908700002201928700002201950773012601972856007402098852000902172655001202181IND60732133420221120190610.0210326e20210306xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073213342DNAL7 a10.3390/md190301432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMoriou, Céline 10aBioactive Bromotyrosine Derivatives from the Pacific Marine Sponge Suberea clavata (Pulitzer-Finali, 1982)  aChemical investigation of the South-Pacific marine sponge Suberea clavata led to the isolation of eight new bromotyrosine metabolites named subereins 1–8 (2–9) along with twelve known co-isolated congeners. The detailed configuration determination of the first representative major compound of this family 11-epi-fistularin-3 (11R,17S) (1) is described. Their chemical characterization was achieved by HRMS and integrated 1D and 2D NMR (nuclear magnetic resonance) spectroscopic studies and extensive comparison with literature data. For the first time, a complete assignment of the absolute configurations for stereogenic centers C-11/17 of the known members (11R,17S) 11-epi-fistularin-3 (1) and 17-deoxyfistularin-3 (10) was determined by a combination of chemical modifications, Mosher’s technology, and ECD spectroscopy. Consequently, the absolute configurations of all our new isolated compounds 2–9 were determined by the combination of NMR, Mosher’s method, ECD comparison, and chemical modifications. Interestingly, compounds 2–7 were obtained by chemical transformation of the major compound 11-epi-fistularin-3 (1). Evaluation for acetylcholinesterase inhibition (AChE), DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) modulating activity and antifouling activities using marine bacterial strains are also presented.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA methyltransferase 3aSuberea 3aacetylcholinesterase 3ametabolites 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy1 aLacroix, Damien 1 aPetek, Sylvain 1 aEl-Demerdash, Amr 1 aTrepos, Rozenn 1 aLeu, Tinihauarii  Mareva1 aFlorean, Cristina 1 aDiederich, Marc 1 aHellio, Claire 1 aDebitus, Cécile 1 aAl-Mourabit, Ali 0 tMarine drugs.g2021 Mar. 06, v. 19, no. 3dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21403x1660-33977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/md190301433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02311naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002400143245017000167300001600337520114700353592002801500650003501528650001501563650001701578650001101595650003201606650001301638650000701651650001801658650002601676650001301702650001101715700001901726773011801745856007701863852000901940655001201949IND50073499420221117064133.0150213e200110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007349942DNAL7 a10.1007/s0021601009422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOssadnik, Stephanie10aComparative study of the determination of peroxomonosulfate, in the presence of other oxidants, by capillary zone electrophoresis, ion chromatography, and photometry  ap. 420-424.  aSeveral methods for quantitative determination of peroxomonosulfate in detergents, in the presence of other oxidants, have been investigated. The photometric technique applied was based on the well-known starch–iodine reaction. The oxidizing agent was quantified by determining the amount of iodine produced. The influence of other oxidants present was examined. Ion analysis was performed by capillary zone electrophoresis (CZE) and ion chromatography (IC). Because peroxomonosulfate in detergents is always accompanied by sulfate, the main goal was to separate the sulfur species without causing the decomposition of the unstable peroxomonosulfate ion. The sulfur species could be separated within less than 4 min by CZE with a pyromellitic acid electrolyte at pH 3.5 to 5.0. Sulfate and peroxomonosulfate were separated by IC within 11 min by use of a phthalic acid mobile phase at pH 3.0. The peroxomonosulfate content was determined by calibration. The calibration plot was linear from 5 to 50 µg mL–¹SO₅²–for IC and from 7.3 to 182.3 µg mL–¹SO₅²–(corresponding to 20 to 500 µg mL–¹triple salt) for CZE.  aPublisher supplied data 3acapillary zone electrophoresis 3adetergents 3aelectrolytes 3aiodine 3aion exchange chromatography 3aoxidants 3apH 3aphthalic acid 3aquantitative analysis 3asulfates 3asulfur1 aSchwedt, Georg0 tFresenius' journal of analytical chemistry.g2001 Oct., v. 371, no. 4 p.420-424dSpringer-Verlagx0937-06337nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s0021601009423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02829naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002100140245010900161520144700270592002801717650002601745650002801771650001301799650001501812650003101827650001401858650001201872650001801884650001501902650001301917650002001930650002201950700002501972700002601997700002902023700002602052700002302078700003002101700002002131700002302151773012602174856007402300852000902374655001202383IND60732133520221120180921.0210326e20210306xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073213352DNAL7 a10.3390/md190301442doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTucker, Luke  J.10aPhysicochemical and Antimicrobial Properties of Thermosensitive Chitosan Hydrogel Loaded with Fosfomycin  aThermosensitive chitosan hydrogels—renewable, biocompatible materials—have many applications as injectable biomaterials for localized drug delivery in the treatment of a variety of diseases. To combat infections such as Staphylococcus aureus osteomyelitis, localized antibiotic delivery would allow for higher doses at the site of infection without the risks associated with traditional antibiotic regimens. Fosfomycin, a small antibiotic in its own class, was loaded into a chitosan hydrogel system with varied beta-glycerol phosphate (β-GP) and fosfomycin (FOS) concentrations. The purpose of this study was to elucidate the interactions between FOS and chitosan hydrogel. The Kirby Bauer assay revealed an unexpected concentration-dependent inhibition of S. aureus, with reduced efficacy at the high FOS concentration but only at the low β-GP concentration. No effect of FOS concentration was observed for the planktonic assay. Rheological testing revealed that increasing β-GP concentration increased the storage modulus while decreasing gelation temperature. NMR showed that FOS was removed from the liquid portion of the hydrogel by reaction over 12 h. SEM and FTIR confirmed gels degraded and released organophosphates over 5 days. This work provides insight into the physicochemical interactions between fosfomycin and chitosan hydrogel systems and informs selection of biomaterial components for improving infection treatment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aStaphylococcus aureus 3abiocompatible materials 3achitosan 3afosfomycin 3agelatinization temperature 3ahydrogels 3aliquids 3aosteomyelitis 3aphosphates 3aplankton 3astorage modulus 3athermosensitivity1 aGrant, Christine S.,1 aGautreaux, Malley  A.1 aAmarasekara, Dhanush  L.1 aFitzkee, Nicholas  C.1 aJanorkar, Amol  V.1 aVaradarajan, Anandavalli 1 aKundu, Santanu 1 aPriddy, Lauren  B.0 tMarine drugs.g2021 Mar. 06, v. 19, no. 3dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21403x1660-33977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/md190301443Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02564naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245007200167500002200239520146100261592002801722650000901750650001601759650001901775650002901794650002101823650001101844650002201855650001601877650001501893651001001908653002901918653001601947653002901963653002501992773006802017856008402085852000902169655001202178IND60531701220221117190351.0160724s2016    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053170122DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envres.2016.07.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDuan, Hongbo10aEmissions and temperature benefits: the role of wind power in China  aPre-press version  aAs a non-fossil technology, wind power has an enormous advantage over coal because of its role in climate change mitigation. Therefore, it is important to investigate how substituting wind power for coal-fired electricity will affect emission reductions, changes in radiative forcing and rising temperatures, particularly in the context of emission limits.We developed an integrated methodology that includes two parts: an energy-economy-environmental (3E) integrated model and an emission-temperature response model. The former is used to simulate the dynamic relationships between economic output, wind energy and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions; the latter is used to evaluate changes in radiative forcing and warming.Under the present development projection, wind energy cannot serve as a major force in curbing emissions, even under the strictest space-restraining scenario. China's temperature contribution to global warming will be up to 21.76% if warming is limited to 2 degrees. With the wind-for-coal power substitution, the corresponding contribution to global radiative forcing increase and temperature rise will decrease by up to 10% and 6.57%, respectively.Substituting wind power for coal-fired electricity has positive effects on emission reductions and warming control. However, wind energy alone is insufficient for climate change mitigation. It forms an important component of the renewable energy portfolio used to combat global warming.  aPublisher supplied data 3acoal 3aelectricity 3aglobal warming 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3agreenhouse gases 3amodels 3aradiative forcing 3atemperature 3awind power 3aChina 0aClimate integrated model 0aWind energy 0aFossil fuel substitution 0aTemperature benefits0 tEnvironmental Research.g2016, dElsevier Inc.x0013-93517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2016.07.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02563naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002400140245013000164500001400294520122200308592002801530650001401558650002701572650001601599650001801615650003701633650001101670650001201681650002301693650002101716650001701737650001201754650000901766650001101775650001701786700002101803700002401824700002301848700001801871700002301889773012201912856007402034852000902108655001202117IND60729374520221118041845.0210228e20210131xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072937452DNAL7 a10.3390/nu130204752doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGarr Barry, Valene 10aGreater Loss of Central Adiposity from Low-Carbohydrate versus Low-Fat Diet in Middle-Aged Adults with Overweight and Obesity  aNAL-light  aThe objective of this study is to determine whether middle-aged adults prescribed a low carbohydrate-high fat (LCHF) or low fat (LF) diet would have greater loss of central fat and to determine whether the insulin resistance (IR) affects intervention response. A total of 50 participants (52.3 ± 10.7 years old; 36.6 ± 7.4 kg/m2 BMI; 82% female) were prescribed either a LCHF diet (n = 32, carbohydrate: protein: fat of 5%:30%:65% without calorie restriction), or LF diet (n = 18, 63%:13–23%: 10–25% with calorie restriction of total energy expenditure—500 kcal) for 15 weeks. Central and regional body composition changes from dual-x-ray absorptiometry and serum measures were compared using paired t-tests and ANCOVA with paired contrasts. IR was defined as homeostatic model assessment (HOMA-IR) > 2.6. Compared to the LF group, the LCHF group lost more android (15.6 ± 11.2% vs. 8.3 ± 8.1%, p < 0.01) and visceral fat (18.5 ± 22.2% vs. 5.1 ± 15.8%, p < 0.05).

Forty-six compounds, accounting for 96.76% of the total oil, were identified and the main compounds of the essential oil were linalool (11.78%), trans-geraniol (8.58%), 1,8-cineole (7.91%), β-caryophyllene (5.58%), α-terpineol (5.32%), β-selinene (5.15%), and spathulenol (5.04%). The essential oil of D. japonicus possessed contact toxicity against two grain storage insects, Sitophilus zeamais and Tribolium castaneum adults, with LD₅₀ values of 18.32 μg/ adult and 13.45 μg/adult, respectively. The essential oil of D. japonicus also exhibited pronounced fumigant toxicity against S. zeamais (LC₅₀ = 10.11 mg/l air) and T. castaneum adults (LC₅₀ = 5.26 mg/l air). Of the three major compounds, 1,8-cineole exhibited stronger fumigant toxicity than the crude essential oil against S. zeamais and T. castaneum adults with LC₅₀ values of 2.96 mg/l air and 4.86 mg/l air, respectively  aPublisher supplied data 3aDipsacus 3aSitophilus zeamais 3aTribolium castaneum 3aadults 3aaerial parts 3aair 3aalpha-terpineol 3abeta-caryophyllene 3acineole 3aessential oils 3aflowering 3afumigants 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3ainsecticidal properties 3alethal concentration 50 3alethal dose 50 3alinalool 3aoils 3aspathulenol 3astorage insects 0aDipsacus japonicus 0aEssential Oil 0aInsecticidal Activity1 aJiang, Guo Hua1 aZhou, Ligang1 aLiu, Qi Zhi0 tZeitschrift für Naturforschung.g2014 June 2, v. 68, no. 1-2 p.13-18dVerlag der Zeitschrift für NaturforschungwJournal:23183x1865-71257nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1515/znc-2013-1-2033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02850naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002000144245015600164300001400320520119700334592002801531650002701559650001801586650002501604650002501629650002701654650001601681650001901697650004601716650002801762650001901790650001501809650001001824650000901834650004401843650001401887650002201901653002701923653001501950653002101965700002301986700002902009700002702038700002002065700002202085773015002107856007802257852000902335655001202344IND60523151020221117011100.0170211e20140602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052315102DNAL7 a10.1515/znc-2013-1-2042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHawas, Usama W.12aA New Flavonoid C-Glycoside from Solanum elaeagnifolium with Hepatoprotective and Curative Activities against Paracetamol- Induced Liver Injury in Mice  ap. 19-28.  aA new flavonoid C-glycoside, kaempferol 8-C-β-galactoside, along with twelve known glycosidic flavonoids was isolated from the aqueous methanolic extract of Solanum elaeagnifolium Cav. (Solanaceae), by conventional chromatographic methods; their structure elucidation was achieved using UV, ESI-MS, and NMR spectral analyses. Groups of six mice were administered S. elaeagnifolium extracts at 25, 50, and 75 mg/kg body weight (BW) prior to or post administration of a single dose of paracetamol (500 mg/kg BW). The extract showed signifi cant hepatoprotective and curative effects against histopathological and histochemical damage induced by paracetamol in liver. The extract also ameliorated the elevation in glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase (GOT), glutamate pyruvate transaminase (GPT), and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) levels. These findings were accompanied by a nearly normal architecture of the liver in the treated groups, compared to the paracetamol control group. As a positive control, silymarin was used, an established hepatoprotective drug against paracetamol-induced liver injury.

On using a cooled SPME fiber coated with a 75-µm layer of poly(dimethylsiloxane)/carboxene and heating the sample to 35 °C, about 4 times more MTBE is extracted compared to SPME extraction with the fiber placed in the water sample. Stable analytical conditions with a detection limit of 10 ng/L are achieved. By use of a sample volume of 4 mL in a 10 mL vial, a sodium chloride content of 10% (w/w), and an extraction time of 30 min, the total time of an analytical cycle was optimized to 39 min. Precise linearity of R²>0.9991 and R²>0.9916 in the calibration range of 20–5000 ng/L and 20–100 ng/L, both in addition to blanks, respectively, and relative standard deviations of 10% (100 ng/L, long-term) and 11% (20 ng/L, short-term) are presented. The recovery is well within the accepted limits of 83–118% at a concentration of 100 ng/L and even close thereto at trace levels of 20 ng/L (96–125%). The data presented for a concentration of 100 ng/L are examined by statistical methods and show results for the T test at the 95% confidence level. Due to the large concentration range covered, the method is well suited for the monitoring of MTBE in the aquatic environment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaquatic environment 3adetection limit 3aheat 3amonitoring 3arapid methods 3asodium chloride 3asolid phase microextraction 3at-test1 aKolb, Axel1 aPüttmann, Wilhelm0 tFresenius' journal of analytical chemistry.g2001 Oct., v. 371, no. 4 p.519-525dSpringer-Verlagx0937-06337nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s0021601009843Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04210naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003500135040001800170100002300188245015200211300001100363506007600374520233900450592002802789596004202817506003702859650001302896650001602909650002402925650002502949650001102974650001802985650001203003650001603015650001703031650002603048650001003074650004203084650001703126650002303143650001603166650002603182650001503208650001303223650001603236650001403252650001403266650001303280700001603293700002703309700002503336700001903361700002003380773011703400856008203517852000903599655001203608IND60548659720221207121140.0200912e201612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054865972DNAL7 a268395892pmid7 aPMC47364822pmcid7 a10.1186/s13068-016-0441-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCampanaro, Stefano10aMetagenomic analysis and functional characterization of the biogas microbiome using high throughput shotgun sequencing and a novel binning strategy  ap. 26.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Biogas production is an economically attractive technology that has gained momentum worldwide over the past years. Biogas is produced by a biologically mediated process, widely known as “anaerobic digestion.” This process is performed by a specialized and complex microbial community, in which different members have distinct roles in the establishment of a collective organization. Deciphering the complex microbial community engaged in this process is interesting both for unraveling the network of bacterial interactions and for applicability potential to the derived knowledge. RESULTS: In this study, we dissect the bioma involved in anaerobic digestion by means of high throughput Illumina sequencing (~51 gigabases of sequence data), disclosing nearly one million genes and extracting 106 microbial genomes by a novel strategy combining two binning processes. Microbial phylogeny and putative taxonomy performed using >400 proteins revealed that the biogas community is a trove of new species. A new approach based on functional properties as per network representation was developed to assign roles to the microbial species. The organization of the anaerobic digestion microbiome is resembled by a funnel concept, in which the microbial consortium presents a progressive functional specialization while reaching the final step of the process (i.e., methanogenesis). Key microbial genomes encoding enzymes involved in specific metabolic pathways, such as carbohydrates utilization, fatty acids degradation, amino acids fermentation, and syntrophic acetate oxidation, were identified. Additionally, the analysis identified a new uncultured archaeon that was putatively related to Methanomassiliicoccales but surprisingly having a methylotrophic methanogenic pathway. CONCLUSION: This study is a pioneer research on the phylogenetic and functional characterization of the microbial community populating biogas reactors. By applying for the first time high-throughput sequencing and a novel binning strategy, the identified genes were anchored to single genomes providing a clear understanding of their metabolic pathways and highlighting their involvement in anaerobic digestion. The overall research established a reference catalog of biogas microbial genomes that will greatly simplify future genomic studies.  aPublisher supplied data  a12-132654cStrategiske Forskningsråd0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aacetates 3aamino acids 3aanaerobic digestion 3abiochemical pathways 3abiogas 3acarbohydrates 3aenzymes 3afatty acids 3afermentation 3afunctional properties 3agenes 3ahigh-throughput nucleotide sequencing 3ametagenomics 3amethane production 3amethanogens 3amicrobial communities 3amicrobiome 3amomentum 3anew species 3aoxidation 3aphylogeny 3aproteins1 aTreu, Laura1 aKougias, Panagiotis G.1 aDe Francisci, Davide1 aValle, Giorgio1 aAngelidaki, I.,0 tBiotechnology for biofuels.g2016 Dec., v. 9, no. 1 p.26-26dBioMed CentralwJournal:jnl4350543x1754-68347nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13068-016-0441-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02311naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003600113040001800149100002400167245012800191300001800319520080500337592002801142650000801170650000901178650001901187650001301206650001301219650001401232650001201246650004201258650000901300650001101309650003801320650000901358650001501367650007201382651001201454651001201466651001201478651001101490651001101501651002601512700002601538700001701564700001801581773011501599856008201714852000901796655001201805IND60114074320221118022052.0141112e201212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011407432DNAL7 a228245092pmid7 a10.1016/j.rvsc.2012.06.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGavazza, Alessandra10aEstimated prevalence of canine Type 2 Von Willebrand disease in the Deutsch-Drahthaar (German Wirehaired Pointer) in Europe  ap. 1462-1466.  aType 2 Von Willebrand disease (VWD) is a severe coagulopathy occurring in the Deutsch-Drahthaar dog (or German Wirehaired Pointer, DD/GWP).

The genotype distribution (clear, carrier, and affected dogs) was investigated in 1855 DD/GWP dogs using data collected by the DD DNA-VWD-Databank in several European countries. 1704 (91.8%) DD/GWP dogs were genotypically clear of the VWD mutation, 144 (7.8%) were carriers, and seven (0.4%) were affected. The estimated disease allele frequency was highest in Germany and Sweden (almost 5%), and about 1% in Denmark, Finland and Norway.

Here, 6 of the 8 target compounds were detected in all sediments with concentrations ranging from 0.35ngg−1 to 456ngg−1. Higher concentrations of SMs and UVFs were evident in the eastern outlets compared to the western suggesting greater input of these contaminants from the Pearl River Delta (PRD) region. All the compounds showed a decreasing trend toward the seaward side which confirming that riverine runoff was the most important source of SMs and UVFs to the coastal environment. Notably, high levels of SMs and UVFs were detected in two fishing harbors in the PRE area. In comparison to UVFs, the SM compounds exhibited a significant correlation with TOC content in the sediments.  aPublisher supplied data 3aUV filters 3aestuaries 3ariver deltas 3arivers 3arunoff 3asediments 3awater pollution 3aChina 0aSynthetic musks 0aUV filters 0aSediment 0aRiverine runoff 0aPearl River estuary 0aEcological risks1 aXie, Zhiyong1 aYan, Wen1 aMi, Wenying1 aXu, Weihai0 tMarine pollution bulletin.g2016 Oct. 15, v. 111, no. 1-2 p.153-159dElsevier LtdwJournal:12420x0025-326X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.marpolbul.2016.07.0183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03459naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245008700170300001800257520173500275592002802010650002002038650001302058650001702071650001702088650002002105650001502125650001002140650001002150650001102160650000902171650001802180650001402198650002402212650002502236650002102261650001202282650001002294650002102304650001202325650001502337650002102352650001302373653002202386653001302408653000902421653001202430700002802442700007302470700001902543700002602562700003002588700002902618773011502647856008602762852000902848655001202857IND60564998320221117105841.0180831e20160120xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056499832DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2015.07.0442doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPolak, Jolanta10aToxicity and dyeing properties of dyes obtained through laccase-mediated synthesis  ap. 4265-4272.  aThe use of enzymes in textile processes has many advantages as far as environmentally friendly processes are concerned. These advantages include water and energy savings, the use of lower amounts of chemicals, and mild and more sustainable production processes. Several orange–red colored bio-dyes were synthesized during laccase-mediated homomolecular or heteromolecular transformations of simple aromatic precursors. Due to the presence of many various substituents in the structure of these precursors, ensuring their laccase-mediated transformation into colored products, the dyes obtained were tested for their toxicity effect against humans and the environment. The evaluation of environmental toxicity employed the bioluminescent marine bacterium (Vibrio fischeri) as a test organism according to the Microtox® basic test protocol. The effect of dyes on human cells was tested in culture of normal human colon epithelial cells, using two independent tests. Despite the presence of the reactive amino group in the structure of precursors, a majority of the dyes obtained were non-toxic. The presence of a carboxylic and/or sulfonic group in the formula of the precursors ensures a good solubility of the dyes in water. The dyes obtained possess good dyeing activity towards natural and synthetic fibers. Mild conditions of synthesis thereof, as well as a lack of toxic by-products and effluents, constitute advantages of the application of laccase-mediated biocatalysis in the synthesis of textile dyes. Due to the environmental impact associated with the production of textile dyes, the potential application of fungal laccase as a biocatalyst for the synthesis of valuable colorants has been demonstrated in this paper.  aPublisher supplied data 3aVibrio fischeri 3abacteria 3abiocatalysis 3abiocatalysts 3abioluminescence 3abyproducts 3acolon 3acolor 3adyeing 3adyes 3aecotoxicology 3aeffluents 3aenergy conservation 3aenvironmental impact 3aepithelial cells 3afabrics 3afungi 3ahuman cell lines 3alaccase 3asolubility 3asynthetic fibers 3atoxicity 0aBiotransformation 0aToxicity 0aDyes 0aLaccase1 aJarosz-Wilkolazka, Anna1 aSzuster-Ciesielska, Agnieszka1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4046-19201 aWlizlo, Kamila1 aKopycinska, Magdalena1 aSojka-Ledakowicz, Jadwiga1 aLichawska-Olczyk, Joanna0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2016 Jan. 20, v. 112 p.4265-4272dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2015.07.0443Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02895naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003700135040001800172100002000190245010700210300001600317506007600333520141100409592002801820506003701848650002101885650001801906650001901924650001901943650001001962650001301972650003001985650001402015650002202029650001302051653001802064653002002082653001302102653001502115653002702130653000802157700002202165700002002187773011302207856008402320852000902404655001202413IND60528741520221215143102.0220517e20170615xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052874152DNAL7 a273183862pmid7 aPMC55019402pmcid7 a10.1016/j.ydbio.2016.05.0232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBanach, Maureen10aExploring the functions of nonclassical MHC class Ib genes in Xenopus laevis by the CRISPR/Cas9 system  ap. 261-269.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aA large family of highly related and clustered Xenopus nonclassical MHC class Ib (XNC) genes influences Xenopus laevis immunity and potentially other physiological functions. Using RNA interference (RNAi) technology, we previously demonstrated that one of XNC genes, XNC10.1, is critical for the development and function of a specialized innate T (iT) cell population. However, RNAi limitation such as a variable and unstable degree of gene silencing in F0 and F1 generations is hampering a thorough functional analysis of XNC10.1 and other XNC genes. To overcome this obstacle, we adapted the CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene editing technique for XNC genes. We efficiently and specifically generated single gene knockouts of XNC10.1, XNC11, and XNC1 as well as double gene knockouts of XNC10.1 and XNC11 in X. laevis. In single XNC10.1 knockout X. laevis tadpoles, the absence of XNC10.1 and Vα6-Jα1.43 invariant T cell receptor rearrangement transcripts indicated XNC10.1 loss-of-function and deficiency in Vα6-Jα1.43 iT cells. Notably, targeting XNC10.1 did not affect neighboring XNC genes exhibiting high sequence similarity. Furthermore, XNC1 gene disruption induced mortality during developmental stage 47, suggesting some non-immune but essential function of this gene. These data demonstrate that the CRISPR/Cas9 system can be successfully adapted for genetic analysis in F0 generation of X. laevis.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aRNA interference 3aT-lymphocytes 3aXenopus laevis 3agene targeting 3agenes 3aimmunity 3aloss-of-function mutation 3amortality 3asequence homology 3atadpoles 0aGene knockout 0aReverse genetic 0aGenomics 0aAmphibians 0aComparative immunology 0aXNC1 aEdholm, Eva-Stina1 aRobert, Jacques0 tDevelopmental biology.g2017 June 15, v. 426, no. 2 p.261-269dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12382x0012-16067nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ydbio.2016.05.0233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01989naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001500152245008900167300001600256520106000272592002801332650001401360650001301374650001701387650001901404650001601423700001401439700001801453700001801471773009101489856008601580852000901666655001201675IND60095477220221120032848.0141104e20120220xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009547722DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfa.2012.01.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGong, Xiao10aStability of polyelectrolyte multilayer micropatterns in response to post-treatments  ap. 299-304.  aPost-treatments of the micro-molded poly(4-styrenesulfonic acid-co-maleic acid, 1:1 SS:MA) sodium salt (PSSMA)/poly(diallyldimethylammonium chloride) (PDADMAC) multilayers in water or at elevated temperature were conducted to disclose the stability and transformation of patterns prepared at different conditions. The compression induced patterns kept unchanged regardless of the incubation time, while the lateral flow induced patterns disappeared rapidly within 10min in water. Results showed that the pattern disappearance was not caused by the remodeling or swelling of the multilayers, but caused by mass loss of the uncompressed region. Heat treatment of the high ridge patterns could greatly decrease their height and stabilize the pattern structure. The double strip patterns could be transformed to the high ridge patterns and the linear patterns by annealing at 70°C for 3h and 6h, respectively. Therefore, the pattern features and stability against water etching can be effectively modulated by the post-treatment time at elevated temperature.  aPublisher supplied data 3aannealing 3acolloids 3aelectrolytes 3aheat treatment 3atemperature1 aHan, Lulu1 aGao, Jianrong1 aGao, Changyou0 tColloids and surfaces.g2012 Feb. 20, v. 396 p.299-304dElsevier B.V.x0927-77577nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfa.2012.01.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03146naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024005000092040001800142100001800160245007600178300001600254500000900270520205700279592002802336650002602364650002102390650001802411650001902429650002402448650001702472650001602489650001302505650001002518650001002528700001802538773012202556852000902678856009702687655001202784IND8903647220221121013145.0191122e198811  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND890364722DNAL7 a10.2134/agronj1988.00021962008000060025x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSinger, K.

DC.] accession, which has potential value as a grazing-tolerant pasture legume for peninsular Florida and some tropical locations, was evaluated for response to seed storage and scarification treatments. Both practical means of enhancing germination and characteristics of germination limitations were considered. A series of experiments evaluated responses to storage time, storage temperature, physical seed coat disruption with sandpaper, and exposure to steam, hot water, and dry heat. Freshly harvested seed failed to germinate regardless of seed treatment. Seed that had been stored for 3 to 8 yr produced rapid, essentially complete germination when scarified with sandpaper. A storage period of approximately 16 wk was sufficient for rapid germination regardless of storage temperature. At 4 wk of storage, a storage temperature of 7°C resulted in higher germination than storage at 24°C. Steam exposure times of from 40 min to 2 h or exposure to 80°C water for 5 to 10 min produced slow germination rates but greater than 60% germination after 56 d. Exposure to dry heat for 6 or 12 h produced poorer results (48% germination at 56 d) than steam or hot water. These heat treatments could have value either where mechanical scarification is not available or in situations where sporadic, early season rainfall creates high pasture establishment risks for seed lots that have been scarified to provide rapid, complete germination. Failure of scarified, imbibed, fresh seed to germinate indicates a physiological limitation to germination. Rapid, essentially complete germination of these seed lots after storage periods of from 16 wk to a number of years indicates that an afterripening period overcomes this limitation. Physical seed coat impermeability or hardseededness is demonstrated by the need for scarification even in seed that has been stored long enough to meet the after-ripening requirement.

Little is known about how the persistence of picky eating in childhood is associated with changes in weight and food intake from childhood into adolescence. Objective: We determined whether picky eating identified in childhood was related to growth, nutrition, and parental use of pressure over a 10-y period. Design: Non-Hispanic white girls (n = 181) participated in a longitudinal study and were assessed biannually from ages 5 to 15 y. The Child Feeding Questionnaire was used to classify girls as persistent picky eaters or nonpicky eaters and to assess parental use of pressure to eat. Height and weight were measured to calculate body mass index (BMI) z scores at each occasion. Three 24-h dietary recalls obtained at each occasion were used to determine intakes of fruit and vegetables. With the use of repeated-measures analyses, differences between persistent picky eaters and nonpicky eaters in BMI z scores, dietary intake, and use of pressure were examined. Results: From ages 5 to 15 y, persistent picky eaters (n = 33; 18%) had lower BMI (tracking at the 50th percentile) than did nonpicky eaters (n = 148; tracking at the 65th percentile) (P = 0.02). Persistent picky eaters were less likely to be overweight into adolescence. Both groups consumed less than the recommended amounts of fruit and vegetables, although persistent picky eaters had lower intakes of vegetables than did nonpicky eaters at all time points (P = 0.02). Persistent picky eaters also received higher amounts of pressure (P = 0.01). Conclusions: Findings that persistent picky eaters were within the normal weight range, were less likely to be overweight, and had similar fruit intakes to those of nonpicky eaters suggest that higher parental concerns about persistent picky eaters are unwarranted. All parents and children could benefit from evidence-based anticipatory guidance on alternatives to coercive feeding practices to increase fruit and vegetable consumption.  aPublisher supplied data  aR01 HD32973cNIHdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100000002  cThe National Dairy Council  cGeneral Clinical Research Center  aM01 RR10732cThe Pennsylvania State Universitydhttps://doi.org/10.13039/1000083210 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aWhites 3aadolescence 3abody mass index 3achildhood 3achildren 3adiet recall 3aeating habits 3afruit products 3agirls 3alongitudinal studies 3aoverweight 3aparents 3aquestionnaires 3avegetable consumption 3avegetables 0achildren 0adiet 0agrowth 0apicky eating 0aweight1 aHohman, Emily E1 aMarini, Michele E1 aSavage, Jennifer S1 aBirch, Leann L.,0 tAmerican journal of clinical nutrition.g2016 Dec. 01, v. 104, no. 6 p.1577-1582dOxford University PresswJournal:jnl45206x1938-32077nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3945/ajcn.116.1424303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03640naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245018200171506011700353506007600470520168700546592002802233506003702261650002302298650002002321650002002341650002102361650001502382650001802397650001102415650000902426650002702435650003002462650000902492650002002501650001402521650001902535651001002554653002602564653002502590653002202615653002702637653002002664700001802684700001502702700001702717700001202734700001602746700001702762700001802779700001702797700002002814773012202834856008502956852000903041655001203050IND60755242720221207052409.0220404e20211220xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075524272DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecoenv.2021.1129362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Hanxiaoya10aEcosystem impact and dietary exposure of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and heavy metals in Chinese mitten crabs (Eriocheir sinensis) and their farming areas in Jiangsu, China  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThis study investigated the presence of 18 dioxin-like and non-dioxin-like polychlorinated biphenyls (dl- and ndl-PCBs), heavy metals (Cd, Hg, Pb, and As) in Chinese mitten crabs (Eriocheir sinensis) and their distribution in Jiangsu, China. Risk assessment and source apportionment were employed for evaluating the eco-toxicological impact and human exposure. It was found that the compositions of PCBs varied spatially, suggesting different sources of pollutants, whilst PCB 28, 105, 114, and 126 were consistently found in all sample types, suggesting a common pollution source remained, and the bio-accumulation process was in effect. The total PCBs in sediment were found much higher than in water, and brown meat had the highest and most diverse PCB congeners among all tissues. The presence of heavy metals was found in all samples in descending order of As>Cd>Pb>Hg and in the order of shell>brown meat>white meat>gill for crabs. The results of risk assessment indicated that the potential carcinogenic and non-carcinogenic risks were within the acceptable range for long-term consumption of the crabs overall. However, the highest toxic equivalent (TEQ), carcinogenic, and non-carcinogenic risks were all recorded in Location C, where dl-PCB 126, 169, and As contributed to the majority of the risks. The ecological risk posed by all HMs was low, but cases of serious point source pollution have been found in the investigated regions, and risks caused by Cd individually should raise concerns. Source apportionment study revealed that the contaminants mostly originated from anthropogenic activities.

How AT1 cells arise from the distal lung epithelial progenitor cells prior to birth and whether this process depends on a developmental niche instructed by mesenchymal cells is poorly understood. We show that mice lacking histone deacetylase 3 specifically in the developing lung mesenchyme display lung hypoplasia including decreased mesenchymal proliferation and a severe impairment of AT1 cell differentiation. This is correlated with a decrease in Wnt/β-catenin signaling in the lung epithelium. We demonstrate that inhibition of Wnt signaling causes defective AT1 cell lineage differentiation ex vivo. Importantly, systemic activation of Wnt signaling at specific stages of lung development can partially rescue the AT1 cell differentiation defect in vivo. These studies show that histone deacetylase 3 expression generates an important developmental niche in the lung mesenchyme through regulation of Wnt signaling, which is required for proper AT1 cell differentiation and lung sacculation.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acell differentiation 3aepithelium 3ahistone deacetylase 3amice 3astem cells 0aLung 0aHDAC3 0aWnt signaling 0aProliferation 0aAlveolar type 1 cell1 aWang, Yi1 aSnitow, Melinda E.1 aStewart, Kathleen M.1 aLi, Shanru1 aLu, MinMin1 aMorrisey, Edward E.0 tDevelopmental biology.g2016 June 15, v. 414 p.161-169dElsevier Inc.x0012-16067nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ydbio.2016.04.0233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03023naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001600139245015300155300001800308500001900326500002000345520137800365592002801743596005901771596005901830596006601889596004701955596007402002650002202076650001002098650001802108650002602126650001102152650001702163650001302180650000902193650001302202650001202215650001202227700001902239700001502258700001802273700002002291700001802311773011802329856007302447852000902520655001202529IND60734407720221119090002.0210417e201312  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073440772DNAL7 a10.1111/nph.124472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFeng, Zhike10aNucleocapsid of Tomato spotted wilt tospovirus forms mobile particles that traffic on an actin/endoplasmic reticulum network driven by myosin XI‐K  ap. 1212-1224.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aA number of viral proteins from plant viruses, other than movement proteins, have been shown to traffic intracellularly along actin filaments and to be involved in viral infection. However, there has been no report that a viral capsid protein may traffic within a cell by utilizing the actin/endoplasmic reticulum (ER) network. We used Tomato spotted wilt tospovirus (TSWV) as a model virus to study the cell biological properties of a nucleocapsid (N) protein. We found that TSWV N protein was capable of forming highly motile cytoplasmic inclusions that moved along the ER and actin network. The disruption of actin filaments by latrunculin B, an actin‐depolymerizing agent, almost stopped the intracellular movement of N inclusions, whereas treatment with a microtubule‐depolymerizing reagent, oryzalin, did not. The over‐expression of a myosin XI‐K tail, functioning in a dominant‐negative manner, completely halted the movement of N inclusions. Latrunculin B treatment strongly inhibited the formation of TSWV local lesions in Nicotiana tabacum cv Samsun NN and delayed systemic infection in N. benthamiana. Collectively, our findings provide the first evidence that the capsid protein of a plant virus has the novel property of intracellular trafficking. The findings add capsid protein as a new class of viral protein that traffics on the actin/ER system.  aPublisher supplied data  a31222045cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a31171813cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  aNCET‐12‐0888cNew Century Excellent Talents in University  a131027cFok Ying Tung Education Foundation  a2010CB134501cNational Program on Key Basic Research Project of China 3aNicotiana tabacum 3aactin 3acoat proteins 3aendoplasmic reticulum 3amyosin 3anucleocapsid 3aoryzalin 3atail 3atomatoes 3atraffic 3aviruses1 aChen, Xiaojiao1 aBao, Yiqun1 aDong, Jiahong1 aZhang, Zhongkai1 aTao, Xiaorong0 tnew phytologist.g2013 Dec., v. 200, no. 4 p.1212-1224dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl44665x0028-646X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/nph.124473Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03515naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245015300167300001600320520182400336592002802160650002002188650001402208650001502222650001002237650002802247650001602275650001702291650001402308650002102322650003202343650001102375650001502386650001902401650001402420650002102434650001502455650001402470650001602484653002702500653002602527653003302553653002202586653002902608700002402637700001702661700002102678700002002699700002002719700002402739773009502763856008202858852000902940655001202949IND60553451620221119202744.0170607e20150515xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055345162DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bios.2014.09.0492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEichler, Marie12aA novel 96-well multielectrode array based impedimetric monitoring platform for comparative drug efficacy analysis on 2D and 3D brain tumor cultures  ap. 582-589.  aAggressive cancer entities like neuroblastoma and glioblastoma multiforme are still difficult to treat and have discouraging prognosis in malignant stage. Since each tumor has its own characteristics concerning the sensitivity towards different chemotherapeutics and moreover, can obtain resistance, the development of novel chemotherapeutics with a broad activity spectrum, high efficacy and minimum side effects is a continuous process. Sophisticated in vitro assays for comprehensive prediction of in vivo drug efficacy and side effects represent an actual bottleneck in the drug development process. In this context, we developed a novel in vitro 2D and 3D multiwell–multielectrode device for drug efficacy monitoring based on direct real-time impedance spectroscopy measurement in combination with our unique 96-well multielectrode arrays and microcavity arrays. For demonstration, we used three neuro- and glioblastoma cell lines that were cultured as monolayer and multicellular tumor spheroids for recapitulating in vivo conditions. Using our novel 96-well multielectrode array based system it was possible to detect time and concentration dependent responses concerning treatment with doxorubicin, etoposide and vincristine. While all tested chemotherapeutics revealed high potency for apoptosis induction in neuroblastoma cells, etoposide was ineffective for glioblastoma cell lines. Determination of IC50 values allowed us to compare drug efficacy in 2D and 3D culture models and moreover, revealed chemotherapeutic and tumor cell line specific activity patterns. These pharmacokinetic patterns are of great interest in the context of preclinical drug development. Thus, impedance spectroscopy based monitoring systems could be used for the fast in vitro based in vivo prediction of novel anti-tumor drugs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadverse effects 3aapoptosis 3abiosensors 3abrain 3adielectric spectroscopy 3adoxorubicin 3adrug therapy 3aetoposide 3ain vitro studies 3ainhibitory concentration 50 3amodels 3amonitoring 3aneoplasm cells 3aneoplasms 3apharmacokinetics 3aprediction 3aprognosis 3avincristine 0aImpedance spectroscopy 0a3D brain tumor models 0a96-well-multielectrode array 0aMicrocavity array 0aDrug efficacy monitoring1 aJahnke, Heinz-Georg1 aKrinke, Dana1 aMüller, Astrid,1 aSchmidt, Sabine1 aAzendorf, Ronny1 aRobitzki, Andrea A.0 tBiosensors & bioelectronics.g2015 May 15, v. 67 p.582-589dElsevier B.V.x0956-56637nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bios.2014.09.0493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03159naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100002100166245016200187300001600349520111900365592002801484650003601512650001601548650001301564650001101577650002801588650001201616650001701628650001201645650001901657650001301676650001101689650002401700650002701724650004301751650005401794650004901848650003101897650004801928650002501976650002902001650002802030650001302058650004402071650005702115650004202172650004202214650003302256650002002289650003402309650003302343700002402376773010002400856004802500852000902548655001202557IND50072868920221119043153.0140211e201403  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007286892DNAL7 a241423832pmid7 a10.1007/s11103-013-0145-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHoefle, Caroline12aA barley Engulfment and Motility domain containing protein modulates Rho GTPase activating protein HvMAGAP1 function in the barley powdery mildew interaction  ap. 469-478.  aEngulfment and Motility (ELMO) proteins are involved in the regulation of small GTPase activity in eukaryotic organisms, but little is known about ELMO proteins in plants. We isolated the barley ELMO Domain Containing Protein, HvELMOD_C, in a yeast two hybrid screen for proteins interacting with HvMAGAP1 (Microtubule Associated ROP-GTPase Activating Protein 1). HvMAGAP1 is considered as an antagonist of barley RACB, a member of the RHO of plant (ROP) family GTPases, which functions as a susceptibility factor in the interaction of barley with the barley powdery mildew fungus Blumeria graminis f.sp. hordei. HvELMOD_C interacts with the central RHO-GAP domain of HvMAGAP1. Cytoplasmic HvELMOD_C translocates to microtubules on co-expression of HvMAGAP1 but not on co-expression of HvMAGAP1-R185G, a mutant of the catalytically active arginine R185 in the RHO-GAP domain. HvELMOD_C, when simultaneously expressed with HvMAGAP1, abolished the resistance-inducing effect of HvMAGAP1 to B. graminis f.sp. hordei. Therefore, HvELMOD_C might function as a new modulator of HvMAGAP1 and thus ROP activity in barley.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBlumeria graminis f. sp. hordei 3aantagonists 3aarginine 3abarley 3aguanosinetriphosphatase 3ahybrids 3amicrotubules 3amutants 3apowdery mildew 3aproteins 3ayeasts 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAscomycotaxphysiology 2aFluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer 2aGTPase-Activating Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aHordeumxgeneticsxmetabolismxmicrobiology. 2aHost-Pathogen Interactions 2aLuminescent Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aMicroscopy, Confocal 2aMicrotubulesxmetabolism 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aMutation 2aPlant Diseasesxgeneticsxmicrobiology. 2aPlant Epidermisxcytologyxmetabolismxmicrobiology. 2aPlant Leavesxcytologyxmicrobiology. 2aPlant Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aPlants, Genetically Modified 2aProtein Binding 2aSequence Homology, Amino Acid 2aTwo-Hybrid System Techniques1 aHückelhoven, Ralph0 tPlant molecular biology.g2014 Mar., v. 84, no. 4-5 p.469-478dSpringer-Verlagx0167-44127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11103-013-0145-x  aDNAL 7aarticle01483naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094024002100128024001900149040001800168100002200186245007500208300001200283506007600295520036100371592002800732506003700760650001600797650000800813650002000821650001100841650001300852650002600865650001600891700002100907773010400928856008001032852000901112655001201121IND60119500120221207082634.0141214e200412  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011950012DNAL7 a10.1186/gb-2004-5-12-2492doi7 aPMC5457872pmcid7 a155759752pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZilberman, Daniel10aSilencing of transposons in plant genomes: kick them when they're down  ap. 764.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aRecent progress in understanding the silencing of transposable elements in the model plant Arabidopsis has revealed an interplay between DNA methylation, histone methylation and small interfering RNAs.

We found that FOXL2 interacts with specific C-terminal propeptides of several fibrillary collagens. Because these propeptides can participate in feedback regulation of collagen biosynthesis, we inferred that FOXL2 could thereby affect the transcription of the cognate collagen genes. Focusing on COL1A2, we found that FOXL2 indeed affects collagen synthesis, by binding to a DNA response element located about 65Kb upstream of this gene. According to our hypothesis we found that in Foxl2−/− mouse ovaries, Col1a2 was elevated from birth to adulthood.The extracellular matrix (ECM) compartmentalizes the ovary during folliculogenesis, (with type I, type III and type IV collagens as primary components), and ECM composition changes during the reproductive lifespan. In Foxl2−/− mouse ovaries, in addition to up-regulation of Col1a2, Col3a1, Col4a1 and fibronectin were also upregulated, while laminin expression was reduced. Thus, by regulating levels of extracellular matrix components, FOXL2 may contribute to both ovarian histogenesis and the fibrosis attendant on depletion of the follicle reserve during reproductive aging and menopause.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDNA 3aanimal ovaries 3aautoregulation 3abiosynthesis 3acartilage 3acollagen 3aextracellular matrix 3aeyelids 3afibronectins 3afibrosis 3afollicular development 3agenes 3alaminin 3alongevity 3amenopause 3amice 3amorphogenesis 3askeletal development 3atranscription factors 0aFOXL2 0aCOL1A2 0aTranscriptional regulation 0aOvary 0aECM1 aDeiana, Manila1 aMarcia, Loredana1 aSbardellati, Andrea1 aAsunis, Isadora1 aMeloni, Alessandra1 aAngius, Andrea1 aCusano, Roberto1 aLoi, Angela1 aCrobu, Francesca1 aFotia, Giorgio1 aCucca, Francesco1 aSchlessinger, David1 aCrisponi, Laura0 tDevelopmental biology.g2016, dElsevier Inc.x0012-16067nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ydbio.2016.05.0223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03176naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002700139245011400166300001800280500001900298500002000317520155700337592002801894596002301922596005001945596004901995650001802044650002402062650001102086650001102097650002502108650001602133650001202149650002202161650001602183650001502199650001802214650001602232650001302248650001502261650001102276650001202287700002502299700002902324700002102353700002202374700002002396700001802416773011802434856007302552852000902625655001202634IND60734408020221118232755.0210417e201312  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073440802DNAL7 a10.1111/nph.124382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMachado, Ricardo A.

Photoassimilates are required for defensive compounds and carbon storage below ground and may therefore be depleted or enriched in the roots of herbivore‐defoliated plants. The potential role of belowground tissues as mediators of induced tolerance–defense trade‐offs is unknown. We evaluated signaling and carbohydrate dynamics in the roots of Nicotiana attenuata following Manduca sexta attack. Experimental and natural genetic variability was exploited to link the observed metabolite patterns to plant tolerance and resistance. Leaf‐herbivore attack decreased sugar and starch concentrations in the roots and reduced regrowth from the rootstock and flower production in the glasshouse and the field. Leaf‐derived jasmonates were identified as major regulators of this root‐mediated resource‐based trade‐off: lower jasmonate levels were associated with decreased defense, increased carbohydrate levels and improved regrowth from the rootstock. Application and transport inhibition experiments, in combination with silencing of the sucrose non‐fermenting (SNF) ‐related kinase GAL83, indicated that auxins may act as additional signals that regulate regrowth patterns. In conclusion, our study shows that the ability to mobilize defenses has a hidden resource‐based cost below ground that constrains defoliation tolerance. Jasmonate‐ and auxin‐dependent mechanisms may lead to divergent defensive plant strategies against herbivores in nature.  aPublisher supplied data  cMax Planck Society  a273107cMarie Curie Intra European Fellowship  a140196cSwiss National Foundation Fellowship 3aManduca sexta 3aNicotiana attenuata 3aauxins 3acarbon 3acarbon sequestration 3adefoliation 3aflowers 3agenetic variation 3agreenhouses 3aherbivores 3ajasmonic acid 3ametabolites 3aregrowth 3arootstocks 3astarch 3asucrose1 aFerrieri, Abigail P.1 aRobert, Christelle A.

In the export-oriented economy, such as Australia, the modelling requires clearly distinguishing the cycles within and outside of a country, and needs an adequate metrics to assess the country's targets in “closing the material loop”. This article investigates Australian position in the global cycles of metals production and use, and assesses the potential for circularity of metals within the country based on data from 2002 onwards. The analysis shows that over the period from 2002 to 2011 the overall estimate of metals final consumption grew from 8.8 million tonnes to 12.3 million tonnes, or from 445 to 551 kg per person. Similarly, the amount of generated waste metal is estimated to have grown from approximately 5 million tonnes to 6 million tonnes, or 250–270 kg per person respectively. The amount of collected metal scrap grew from 3.3 Mt to 3.9 Mt, with the overall collection rates being relatively stable at about 70%. However, the domestic processing of collected scrap decreased significantly – from 67% in early 2000s to 41% in early 2010s, while the export of scrap increased accordingly. The current levels of waste metal generation, metal scrap collection, and domestic processing of metal scrap in Australia equal approximately 50%, 35%, and 15% of the country's metals final consumption respectively.  aPublisher supplied data 3aexports 3ametals 3amodels 3arecycling 3awastes 3aAustralia 0aMetal flows 0aRecycling 0aEnvironmental impacts 0aCircular economy 0aAustralia1 aCorder, Glen0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2016 Jan. 20, v. 112 p.4296-4303dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2015.07.0833Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02460naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245016100171300001800332520100700350592002801357650001101385650002101396650002301417650002001440650001601460650001401476650001101490650002201501650001401523650002301537650001801560650001101578650001501589650001601604653003501620653003001655653002301685653001001708653002701718700001701745700001801762773011501780856008601895852000901981655001201990IND60564999420221117105536.0180831e20160120xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056499942DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2015.07.0862doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Earl-Juei10aElectricity monitoring system with fuzzy multi-objective linear programming integrated in carbon footprint labeling system for manufacturing decision making  ap. 3935-3951.  aIn the novel electricity monitoring system designed in this study, manufacturing data with energy consumption are transformed in real time in the communication module and analysis module and then sent to such information devices as notebooks, i-Pads, or i-Phones. A fuzzy multiple objective linear programming (FMOLP) model is formulated to integrate the designed system for making decision associated with about environmental regulations and cost-effectiveness of carbon emissions in manufacturing firms given a carbon footprint label (CFL). Implementation results demonstrate that the proposed system is very effective in terms of CFL, cost-effectiveness, and manufacturing capacity. Importantly, the electric monitoring system can be practically installed in specific equipment to acquire electric consumption in real time and then helped decision makers to achieve a satisfactory solution in which manufacturing costs and CFL are simultaneously considered under restrain of electricity uncertainty.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3acarbon footprint 3acost effectiveness 3adecision making 3aelectricity 3aemissions 3aenergy 3aenvironmental law 3aequipment 3alinear programming 3amanufacturing 3amodels 3amonitoring 3auncertainty 0aElectricity monitoring systems 0aEnvironmental regulations 0aCost-effectiveness 0aFMOLP 0aCarbon footprint label1 aLin, Chun-Yu1 aSu, Tai-Sheng0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2016 Jan. 20, v. 112 p.3935-3951dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2015.07.0863Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03476naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001400150245013400164506011700298506007600415520161700491592002802108506003702136650001602173650001002189650001502199650001402214650001602228651001002244653001002254653002802264653002502292653002902317653003102346653000902377653000802386653000802394653000802402653000802410653000802418653000802426653000902434653000902443653000802452653000902460653000902469700001702478700001502495700001702510700001602527700001602543700001602559700001502575700001802590700001702608700001402625773010502639856008502744852000902829655001202838IND60755243520221207084003.0220719e202201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075524352DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envint.2021.1069522doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Danni10aMulti-factor reconciliation of discrepancies in ozone-precursor sensitivity retrieved from observation- and emission-based models  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aGround-level O₃ pollution has been continuously worsening in China despite gradual improvement in other major pollutant levels. Understanding the sensitivity of O₃ production to its precursors (OPS) is a prerequisite for formulating effective O₃ control measures, but this has been hampered by significant discrepancies in OPS produced by traditional identification approaches using observation-based models (OBM) and emission-based models (EBM). In this study, by applying OBM and EBM in parallel within a month having significant O₃ pollution in Shanghai, China, we demonstrated that a lack of carbonyl input, overestimation in NO₂ monitoring data, and differences in simulation period and emission reduction area were the core factors leading to OPS discrepancies, and that a reliable OPS cannot be obtained unless these factors are reconciled. By collectively addressing these factors, the number of days with a consistent OPS from both models increased from 6–7 to 20–21 in a month, and the R value defined to quantify the discrepancy decreased by ∼55%. The contributions of these factors to OPS discrepancy differed greatly in urban and suburban settings, mainly caused by differences in pollutant emission and transport characteristics. Overall, OPS identified solely by OBM or EBM is associated with great uncertainty, while reliable OPS estimation can be achieved by a collective application of OBM and EBM with consensus on the above factors. The method demonstrated here could be applied to other photo-chemically active regions worldwide as part of efforts to address ozone pollution.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aenvironment 3aozone 3apollutants 3apollution 3auncertainty 3aChina 0aOzone 0aObservation-based model 0aEmission-based model 0aO3 precursor sensitivity 0aDiscrepancy reconciliation 0aMDA8 0aOPS 0aCTM 0aOBM 0aEBM 0aRIR 0aTUV 0aEKMA 0aNMHC 0aVOC 0aAVOC 0aBVOC1 aYuan, Zibing1 aWang, Ming1 aZhao, Kaihui1 aLiu, Xuehui1 aDuan, Yusen1 aFu, Qingyan1 aWang, Qian1 aJing, Shengao1 aWang, Hongli1 aZhao, Xin0 tEnvironment international.g2022 Jan., v. 158 p.106952-dElsevier LtdwJournal:6374x0160-41207nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envint.2021.1069523Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02780naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003900113040001800152100001500170245017500185300001400360500001500374520101900389592002801408650002101436650000901457650001401466650002701480650003001507650001201537650003101549650002101580650002901601650001101630650004301641650002601684650004701710650001201757650002301769650002101792650004001813650001101853650000901864650004101873653004301914700001801957700002201975700002101997700001702018700001502035773008202050856008502132852000902217655001202226IND60113681220221120205209.0141112e201201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011368122DNAL7 a216835332pmid7 a10.1016/j.meatsci.2011.05.0252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPrieto, N.10aNear infrared reflectance spectroscopy predicts the content of polyunsaturated fatty acids and biohydrogenation products in the subcutaneous fat of beef cows fed flaxseed  ap. 43-51.  a2019-12-04  aThis study examined the ability of near infrared reflectance spectroscopy (NIRS) to estimate the concentration of polyunsaturated fatty acids and their biohydrogenation products in the subcutaneous fat of beef cows fed flaxseed.

The growth mechanism of the hollow ZnO micro-hemispheres may be attributed to the preferred adsorption of PSS on (001) plane of ZnO and the Ostwald ripening process.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOstwald ripening 3aX-ray diffraction 3aadsorption 3acolloids 3ascanning electron microscopy 3atransmission electron microscopes 3atransmission electron microscopy 3azinc oxide1 aYan, Shicheng1 aFeng, Jianyong1 aYang, Zaisan1 aFan, Xiaoxing1 aLi, Zhaosheng1 aZou, Zhigang0 tColloids and surfaces.g2012 Feb. 20, v. 396 p.46-50dElsevier B.V.x0927-77577nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfa.2011.12.0393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03252naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245017200166300001800338520177300356592002802129650001002157650002202167650001602189650001002205650001302215650002102228650002002249650002002269650001902289650001602308650001302324650001602337650001202353700006302365700006502428700005602493700005902549773013002608856008302738852000902821655001202830IND60739436620221120062650.0210731e202106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073943662DNAL7 a10.1007/s10811-021-02425-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIto, Tomohiro14aThe effects of irradiance, temperature, and desiccation on the photosynthesis of a brown alga, Sargassum muticum (Fucales), from a native distributional range in Japan  ap. 1777-1791.  aWe determined the effects of irradiance, temperature, and desiccation on the photosynthesis of a brown alga, Sargassum muticum (Fucales), from its native distributional range in Japan by using a pulse amplitude modulation (PAM)-chlorophyll fluorometer and optical dissolved oxygen sensors. Photosynthesis–irradiance curves at three temperatures (8, 20, and 28°C) showed that the maximum net photosynthetic rates (NPₘₐₓ) and saturation irradiance were highest at 28°C. Gross photosynthesis determined at 8–36°C (every four increments) and 300 μmol photons m⁻² s⁻¹ showed that the maximum gross photosynthetic rate (GPₘₐₓ) occurred at 19.5°C ([Formula: see text]), which is consistent with the seawater temperature at its peaked abundance in Japan. The maximum quantum yields (Fᵥ/Fₘ) of photosystem II (PSII) during the 72-h temperature exposures were above 0.60 at 8–28°C but dropped at higher temperatures. Continuous exposure (12 h) to irradiance of 200 (low) and 1000 (high) μmol photons m⁻² s⁻¹ at three temperatures showed remarkable decline in the effective quantum yields (ΔF/Fₘ') of PSII under high irradiance at 8°C only; the Fᵥ/Fₘ measured after 12-h dark acclimation also did not recover to initial values, signifying its sensitivity to photoinhibition at 8°C. Furthermore, the alga exhibited tolerance to 2 h of desiccation with 80% of water loss from the thallus, and ΔF/Fₘ' recovered after 24 h of rehydration in seawater, suggesting potential of photosynthetic recovery of this alga at such low hydration threshold. In conclusion, the adaptation of S. muticum to relatively high irradiance, to broad range of temperature (8–28°C), and to desiccation explains its potentially high invasive capacity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aJapan 3aSargassum muticum 3aacclimation 3aalgae 3aalgology 3adissolved oxygen 3alight intensity 3aphotoinhibition 3aphotosystem II 3arehydration 3aseawater 3atemperature 3athallus1 aBorlongan, Iris Ann1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0335-642X1 aNishihara, Gregory N.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2543-13011 aEndo, Hikaru1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1983-18541 aTerada, Ryūta,1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3193-65920 tJournal of applied phycology.g2021 June, v. 33, no. 3 p.1777-1791dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl3870059x0921-89717nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10811-021-02425-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03310naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100007000147245015900217300001600376520167300392536011902065592002802184650001302212650002002225650001602245650001402261650001802275650001802293650002102311650001602332650001102348650001102359650001602370650003102386650001202417650001502429650001002444650002402454650001002478653001302488653001402501653001802515653001402533700003002547700002002577773011602597856008202713852000902795655001202804IND60788634620221118173352.0220815e202209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078863462DNAL7 a10.1177/026010602110232562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlptekin, İsmail Mücahit1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7089-684010aEffects of β-glucan and inulin consumption on postprandial appetite, energy intake and food consumption in healthy females: A randomized controlled trial  ap. 433-442.  aTo date, several researchers have investigated the association between dietary fibre consumption and satiety. However, there is no study that includes both inulin and β-glucan to compare energy intake (EI) and satiety ratings. The current study investigated the effects of two dietary fibres, β-glucan and inulin, on satiety and food intake. The study was carried out among 24 woman over 18 years of age. The dietary fibres β-glucan (6 g/day) or inulin (6 g/day) were consumed by participants for five weeks. On the first and fifth week visits, the participants consumed a standard breakfast followed by an ad libitum test meal. Appetite was assessed using visual analogue scales (VAS) before and after breakfast. EI was measured at the test meal using plate waste. Both dietary fibres significantly reduced the VAS scores of hunger, prospective food consumption and desire to eat, and increased satiety compared with the control group. However, the area under curve data for the VAS scores did not exhibit a significant difference. Significant reductions in EI and anthropometric values between the first and fifth week measures were observed in both dietary fibre groups. Statistically significant changes occurred in the body weight [-1.25 (1.27) kg], body mass index [-0.41 (0.42) kg/m²], waist circumference [-1.25 (1.04) cm] and waist/hip ratio [-0.01(0.01)] in the β-glucan group, whereas a statistically significant change occurred in body fat percentage in the inulin group [-2.16% (7.49)]. Overall, these findings demonstrate that the participants consuming β-glucan over the course of the five weeks had less EI, felt less hunger and had more satiety.  aFunding The authors received no financial support for the research, authorship and/or publication of this article.  aPublisher supplied data 3abody fat 3abody mass index 3abody weight 3abreakfast 3adietary fiber 3aenergy intake 3afood consumption 3afood intake 3ahunger 3ainulin 3aplate waste 3arandomized clinical trials 3asatiety 3atest meals 3awaist 3awaist circumference 3awomen 0aAppetite 0aβ-glucan 0adietary fibre 0anutrition1 aÇakiroğlu, Funda Pınar1 aÖrmeci, Necati0 tNutrition and health.g2022 Sept., v. 28, no. 3 p.433-442dSAGE PublicationswJournal:jnl34213x2047-945X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1177/026010602110232563Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02167naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245008700170300001800257520066300275592002800938650003100966650001500997650001801012650002201030650001801052650001701070653000901087653001001096653000901106653000701115653000901122653000701131653000701138653000801145653000701153653000801160653000801168653000801176653000701184653001001191653001901201653001801220653002201238653000701260653003101267653001801298653002701316700001901343773015601362856008601518852000901604655001201613IND60539320820221117224633.0190215e20150604xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053932082DNAL7 a10.1016/j.febslet.2015.04.0482doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMakita, Hiroki10aDirectionality of electron transfer in cyanobacterial photosystem I at 298 and 77K  ap. 1412-1417.  aElectron transfer processes in cyanobacterial photosystem I particles from Synechocystis sp.

The aim of this study was to determine the effect of a seaweed extract from the brown algae Durvillaea potatorum and Ascophyllum nodosum as a soil treatment on the yield of wine grapes grown in Australian production and climate conditions. This study used a series of seven field experiments (2012–2017), across five locations, in three Australian states and four cultivars, and analysed data using a linear mixed model approach. The analysis revealed that recurring soil applications of the seaweed extract significantly increased wine grape yield by an average of 14.7% across multiple growing years that experienced climate extremes. Partial budget analysis showed that the use of the seaweed extract increased profits depending on the grape cultivar. This study is the most extensive investigation of its type in Australian viticulture to understand the effect of a soil-applied seaweed extract on wine grape production.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAscophyllum nodosum 3aDurvillaea 3aalgology 3acultivars 3adata analysis 3amacroalgae 3aplant extracts 3asoil 3asoil treatment 3astatistical models 3aviticulture 3awine grapes 3awines 3aAustralia1 aMattner, Scott W.1 aHepworth, Graham1 aMcClintock, David,d1913-2001,1 aMcClinock, Rachael0 tJournal of applied phycology.g2021 June, v. 33, no. 3 p.1883-1891dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl3870059x0921-89717nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10811-021-02423-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01333naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001500140245009700155300002000252520038100272592002800653650002400681650001700705650002200722650003100744700001300775700001800788700001700806773012500823856007400948852000901022655001201031IND60641056620221121010050.0190505e20160905xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064105662DNAL7 a10.1039/c6ra16055g2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZheng, Min10aSolvatochromic fluorescent carbon dots as optic noses for sensing volatile organic compounds  ap. 83501-83504.  aAmphiphilic carbon dots (CDs) with strong solvatochromism were synthesized via solvothermal method.

The composites made up of SA resin and ZnO were also prepared for systematically investigating the effect of the surface nature of ZnO on the structure and property of the composites. Results show that the surface nature of ZnO determines the interfacial and morphological features of the composites, and thus leads to different integrated properties. Compared with ZnO/SA composites, ZnO-PMMA/SA composites possess higher UV-shielding efficiency and transmittance of the visible light, better thermal stability and lower dielectric loss. Specifically, the addition of a small amount (0.05wt.%) of ZnO-PMMA to SA resin can significantly improve the UV-shielding efficiency (the composite absorbs 97% of UV light at 340nm) while maintaining high transmittance of the visible light (88% at 650nm); moreover, the composite also has high thermal stability and favorable dielectric property. These attractive features of ZnO-PMMA/SA composites suggest that the method proposed herein is a new approach to develop high performance transparent optoelectronic materials for cutting-edge industries.  aPublisher supplied data 3acolloids 3adielectric properties 3athermal stability 3atransmittance 3aultraviolet radiation 3azinc oxide1 aGu, Aijuan1 aLiang, Guozheng1 aYuan, Li0 tColloids and surfaces.g2012 Feb. 20, v. 396 p.74-82dElsevier B.V.x0927-77577nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfa.2011.12.0443Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02141naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001400152245007400166300001400240520090900254592002801163650001501191650001301206650001101219650001501230650001701245650001101262650001501273650001101288650000901299650001201308650001401320653002501334653002101359653002001380653002101400653002101421700001801442700001801460700001701478773010401495856008701599852000901686655001201695IND60536549620221116165117.0190409e201503  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053654962DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2014.11.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Xin10aComparison of direct and indirect pyrolysis of micro-algae Isochrysis  ap. 58-62.  aYield and composition of pyrolysis oil in direct and indirect pyrolysis process were investigated which indicated that pyrolysis of defatted microalgae provided a potential way to convert protein and carbohydrate to biofuels. Defatted microalgae pyrolysis with lipid extraction has higher total oil yield than only microalgae direct pyrolysis. There was an increase for N-heterocyclic compounds and phenols and a decrease for hydrocarbons in defatted microalgae pyrolysis oil. There is an apparent decrease from C12 to C16 and nearly no carbon distribution from C17 to C22 for defatted microalgae pyrolysis. Based on composition of pyrolysis feedstock, pyrolysis oil yields were simulated by Compounds Biofuel Model and their accuracy was less than ±4.4%. Considering total oil yield and characteristics, microalgae pyrolysis after lipid extraction process is a promising way for microalgae utilization.  aPublisher supplied data 3aIsochrysis 3abiofuels 3acarbon 3afeedstocks 3ahydrocarbons 3alipids 3amicroalgae 3amodels 3aoils 3aphenols 3apyrolysis 0aMicroalgae pyrolysis 0aLipid extraction 0aTotal oil yield 0aYield simulation 0aRoute evaluation1 aZhao, Bingwei1 aTang, Xiaohan1 aYang, Xiaoyi0 tBioresource technology.g2015 Mar., v. 179 p.58-62dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46263x0960-85247nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2014.11.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02583naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094024002100126024001900147040001800166100002100184245004700205300001200252500001500264506007600279520130100355592002801656506003701684650001501721650001801736650002501754650001101779650001501790650002101805650001601826650003401842650001201876650001401888653001001902700002301912700002401935773010301959856007802062852000902140655001202149IND60119501620221207091548.0141214e200401  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011950162DNAL7 a10.1186/gb-2004-5-2-r82doi7 aPMC3957522pmcid7 a147592582pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHillman, R Tyler13aAn unappreciated role for RNA surveillance  ap. 812.  a2019-12-04  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) is a eukaryotic mRNA surveillance mechanism that detects and degrades mRNAs with premature termination codons (PTC⁺mRNAs). In mammals, a termination codon is recognized as premature if it lies more than about 50 nucleotides upstream of the final intron position. More than a third of reliably inferred alternative splicing events in humans have been shown to result in PTC⁺mRNA isoforms. As the mechanistic details of NMD have only recently been elucidated, we hypothesized that many PTC⁺isoforms may have been cloned, characterized and deposited in the public databases, even though they would be targeted for degradation in vivo. RESULTS: We analyzed the human alternative protein isoforms described in the SWISS-PROT database and found that 144 (5.8% of 2,483) isoform sequences amenable to analysis, from 107 (7.9% of 1,363) SWISS-PROT entries, derive from PTC⁺mRNA. CONCLUSIONS: For several of the PTC⁺isoforms we identified, existing experimental evidence can be reinterpreted and is consistent with the action of NMD to degrade the transcripts. Several genes with mRNA isoforms that we identified as PTC⁺- calpain-10, the CDC-like kinases (CLKs) and LARD - show how previous experimental results may be understood in light of NMD.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3astop codon 3amessenger RNA 3aalternative splicing 3ahumans 3amonitoring 3aprotein isoforms 3anucleotides 3aphosphotransferases (kinases) 3aintrons 3adatabases 0agenes1 aGreen, Richard E.,1 aBrenner, Steven E.,0 tGenome biology.g2004 Jan., v. 5, no. 2 p.812-812dSpringer-VerlagwJournal:19127x1474-760X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/gb-2004-5-2-r83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02910naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245012300168300001800291520150000309592002801809650001401837650001401851650002901865650001301894650001701907650002701924650001401951650002001965650001701985650002102002650002302023650001602046650001202062650001302074650001402087653003302101653002202134653001402156653001302170700001702183700001602200700001802216773009902234856008602333852000902419655001202428IND60535054620221118055227.0190319e20150421xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053505462DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vaccine.2015.02.0452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQiao, Weilin10aConjugation of β-glucan markedly increase the immunogencity of meningococcal group Y polysaccharide conjugate vaccine  ap. 2066-2072.  aMeningococcal disease is a fatal illness of sudden onset caused by Neisseria meningitides. Meningococcal capsular polysaccharide (CPS) is a major virulence factor that generally does not induce immunological memory. Conjugation with a carrier protein can significantly increase the immunogenicity of CPS and induce immunological memory. However, it is highly desired to optimize the CPS-specific immunogenicity of the conjugate vaccine. Although adjuvant has been widely used to improve the immunogenicity of antigens, co-administration and conjugation of adjuvant with the conjugate vaccine has rarely been investigated. As a stimulator of humoral and cellular immunity, β-glucan can activate macrophages and trigger intracellular processes to secrete cytokines initiating inflammatory reactions. In the present study, a conjugate vaccine (CPS-TT) was generated by conjugation of tetanus toxoid (TT) with meningococcal group Y CPS. CPS-TT was further conjugated with β-glucan to generate CPS-TT-G. Immunization with CPS-TT-G led to an 8.2-fold increase in the CPS-specific IgG titers as compared with CPS-TT. Presumably, conjugation of β-glucan ensured the two components to simultaneously reach the antigen presenting cells and stimulate the immune response. In contrast, co-administration of β-glucan suppressed the CPS-specific immunogenicity of CPS-TT. Thus, conjugation of β-glucan is an effective strategy to markedly improve the CPS-specific immunogenicity of the conjugate vaccine.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNeisseria 3aadjuvants 3aantigen-presenting cells 3aantigens 3abeta-glucans 3acell-mediated immunity 3acytokines 3aimmune response 3aimmunization 3aimmunoglobulin G 3aimmunologic memory 3amacrophages 3atetanus 3avaccines 3avirulence 0aMeningococcal polysaccharide 0aConjugate vaccine 0aβ-Glucan 0aAdjuvant1 aJi, Shaoyang1 aZhao, Yubao1 aNiuyuetaohua,0 tVaccine.g2015 Apr. 21, v. 33, no. 17 p.2066-2072dElsevier LtdwJournal:6210x0264-410X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2015.02.0453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02579naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100005900151245004100210300001800251520115200269592002801421650001301449650002101462650002001483650002201503650001101525650001801536650001501554650001501569650002101584650001301605650001201618650002001630650002701650653000901677653002001686653001301706653005501719653001801774700005601792700002201848773015601870856008602026852000902112655001202121IND60539321220221117224708.0190215e20150622xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053932122DNAL7 a10.1016/j.febslet.2015.04.0522doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLinder, Bastian1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1203-313610amRNA metabolism and neuronal disease  ap. 1598-1606.  aTo serve as templates for translation eukaryotic mRNAs undergo an elaborate processing and maturation pathway. In eukaryotes this process comprises the synthesis of mRNA precursors, their processing and transport to the site of translation and eventually their decay. During the entire life cycle, mRNAs interact with distinct sets of trans-acting factors that determine their fate at any given phase of gene expression. Recent studies have shown that mutations in components acting in trans on mRNAs are frequent causes of a large variety of different human disorders. The etiology of most of these diseases is, however, only poorly understood, mostly because the consequences for mRNA-metabolism are unclear. Here we discuss three prominent genetic diseases that fall into this category, namely spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), retinitis pigmentosa (RP) and X-linked syndromic mental retardation (XLMR). Whereas SMA and RP can be directly linked to mRNA processing, XLMR results from mutations in the mRNA surveillance system. We discuss how defects in mRNA maturation and turnover might lead to the tissue specific defects seen in these diseases.  aPublisher supplied data 3aetiology 3aeukaryotic cells 3agene expression 3agenetic disorders 3ahumans 3amessenger RNA 3ametabolism 3amonitoring 3amuscular atrophy 3amutation 3aneurons 3atransactivators 3atranslation (genetics) 0amRNA 0aGenetic disease 0aSplicing 0aPost-transcriptional regulation of gene expression 0amRNA turnover1 aFischer, Utz1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1465-65911 aGehring, Niels H.0 tFEBS letters.g2015 June 22, v. 589, no. 14 p.1598-1606dElsevier B.V.aFederation of European Biochemical SocietieswJournal:jnl16404x0014-57937nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.febslet.2015.04.0523Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03012naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001400150245011600164506011700280506007600397520147400473592002801947506003701975650001602012650001602028650001102044650002602055650002102081650001802102650001302120650001002133653001002143653001002153653001002163653001002173653001202183653001902195700001302214700001902227700001602246700001402262700001602276700001402292700001302306773010502319856008502424852000902509655001202518IND60755244020221207084011.0220719e202201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075524402DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envint.2021.1069632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPeng, Lin10aExposure to perfluoroalkyl substances in waste recycling workers: Distributions in paired human serum and urine  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aOccupational exposure to per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) is an emerging public health concern, because of their potential adverse health effects. In this study, concentrations of 21 legacy and alternative PFASs in paired serum and urine samples collected from 163 workers (from five waste recycling plants) were analyzed. The results showed that the average concentration of 21 PFASs in urine samples (66.6 ng mL⁻¹) were higher than in serum (31.3 ng mL⁻¹). Concentrations of perfluorocarboxylates (PFCAs) in urine were also considerably higher than perfluorosulfonates (PFSAs), especially for short-chain PFCAs. Demographic factors (such as sex, age, working age, and job assignment) on PFAS exposure were also assessed based on the obtained results. PFAS concentrations in serum samples from males were significantly higher than in females, and working age was positively (p < 0.05) associated with most PFAS serum levels. Higher levels of PFAS were found in sorters than in workers with other job assignments, such as managers, suggesting that sorters may be directly exposed to PFASs. Interestingly, perfluorophosphonates (PFPAs) were first to be detected in human urine with >80% detection frequency. The average level of three PFPAs in the serum (7.58 ng mL⁻¹) and urine (1.45 ng mL⁻¹) samples appeared to be higher in comparison with most PFCAs and PFSAs. Thus, the toxicity of PFPAs in human beings needs to be further studied.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3ablood serum 3aenvironment 3ahumans 3aoccupational exposure 3aperfluorocarbons 3apublic health 3atoxicity 3aurine 0aPFASs 0aPFPAs 0aSerum 0aUrine 0aWorkers 0aHuman exposure1 aXu, Wang1 aZeng, Qinghuai1 aSun, Feiyun1 aGuo, Ying1 aZhong, Shan1 aWang, Fei1 aChen, Da0 tEnvironment international.g2022 Jan., v. 158 p.106963-dElsevier LtdwJournal:6374x0160-41207nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envint.2021.1069633Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02577naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001600148245011500164300001800279520145600297592002801753650001901781650001301800650001201813650001301825650001501838650001701853650001001870650001701880650004301897650002001940700001501960700001801975773013001993856008302123852000902206655001202215IND60739437220221120062627.0210731e202106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073943722DNAL7 a10.1007/s10811-021-02405-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Haidong10aIdentification and expression analysis of a calmodulin gene in Phycocalida chauhanii (Rhodophyceae, Bangiales)  ap. 1915-1923.  aCalmodulin (CaM) plays an important regulatory role in plant growth and development. In this study, on the basis of previous transcriptomic annotation a homolog of CaM gene (Pc-CaM7) was identified from the red alga Phycocalida chauhanii (previously known as Porphyra chauhanii). It encoded a 151 amino acids protein with 4 EF-hand regions, which was the typical structure of calmodulin family proteins. Evolutionary analysis showed that Pc-CaM7 shared conserved orthologous relationships with CaMs from Neoporphyra haitanensis (formerly Pyropia haitanensis), Porphyra umbilicalis, and Gracilariopsis chorda. During the developmental period of P. chauhanii gametophytic germlings from 25- to 50-day-old, the asexual archeospores were continuedly released from the marginal region of blades, followed by the emergence of spermatangia from 40-day-old germlings. Based on quantitative real-time PCR analysis, it showed that expression trend of Pc-CaM7 was correlated with the rule of archeospores’ formation and release, whereas in N. haitanensis without archeospore characteristic, the expression pattern of the orthologous gene (Pha_00404) was different, which increased and reached a plateau during the same developmental period. These findings suggested that Pc-CaM7 may be involved in the process of archeospores formation and release, which may provide a foundation for understanding the molecular mechanisms of asexual reproduction in Bangiales.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGracilariopsis 3aPorphyra 3aPyropia 3aalgology 3acalmodulin 3agametophytes 3agenes 3aplant growth 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3atranscriptomics1 aGao, Dahai1 aYan, Xinghong0 tJournal of applied phycology.g2021 June, v. 33, no. 3 p.1915-1923dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl3870059x0921-89717nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10811-021-02405-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01545naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004900094040001800143100001800161245007300179300001600252500000900268520048500277592002800762650000900790650001500799650001600814650002300830650001700853650000900870650001500879650001100894650001800905700001900923773014800942856009601090852000901186655001201195IND60668254620221120054220.0191125e195903  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066825462DNAL7 a10.2136/sssaj1959.03615995002300020026x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPeters, D.

Polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) nanocomposites are formed from the various aspect ratio nanowires and the relationship between the dielectric constant of the nanocomposite and the aspect ratio of the fillers is quantified. It was found that the dielectric constant of the nanocomposite increases with the aspect ratio of the nanowires. Nanocomposites with 30 vol % BaTiO₃ nanowires and an aspect ratio of 45.8 can reach a dielectric constant of 44.3, which is 30.7% higher than samples with an aspect ratio of 9.3 and 352% larger than the polymer matrix. These results demonstrate that using high-aspect-ratio nanowires is an effective way to control and improve the dielectric performance of nanocomposites for future capacitor applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3abarium titanate 3aelectrical equipment 3ananocomposites 3ananowires 3atemperature 3athermoplastics 0ananowire 0aBaTiO3 0ananocomposite 0adielectric 0aaspect ratio1 aZhou, Zhi1 aSodano, Henry A.0 tACS Applied Materials & Interfaces.g2014 Apr. 23, v. 6, no. 8 p.5450-5455dAmerican Chemical Societyx1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fam405038r3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01784naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002000149245014200169300001800311520066000329592002800989650001601017650001201033650001101045650002301056650002301079700002101102700002601123700002501149700001901174700002501193700001801218773010401236856008501340852000901425655001201434IND60579274220221120194302.0170816e20160506xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057927422DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.orglett.6b009042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Shuangjiang10aSyntheses and Structures of Functionalized [9]Cycloparaphenylenes as Carbon Nanohoops Bearing Carbomethoxy and N-Phenylphthalimido Groups  ap. 2268-2271.  aFunctionalized [9]cycloparaphenylenes ([9]CPPs) bearing nine aromatic units in the macrocyclic structures were synthesized.

However, this sector is the second-highest greenhouse gas emitter worldwide due to fossil fuel combustion. Transitioning from conventional to renewable energy propulsion is a promising alternative to climate change mitigation. This study proposes a smart decision-making approach of an integrated system assisted with renewable energy sources to satisfy the dynamic railway electrification demand. The proposed energy system consists of a proton-exchange membrane electrolyzer, solid-oxide fuel cell, and lithium-bromide absorption chiller assisted with solar radiation and wind turbine to simultaneously generate power, hydrogen, cooling, and heating loads. A novel approach consists of power-pinch analysis and multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) to determine the optimal sizing of renewable resources considering the system's thermodynamic, economic, and exergy performance. A total of five optimal scenarios with different renewable sources share were obtained. Accordingly, the scenario with a share of 70/30 of solar and wind energy showed the highest competitiveness based on the MCDM. This scenario showed an energetic and exergetic efficiency of 49% and 34%, respectively. Furthermore, it yielded acceptable subproducts generation, including the production of 312.25 kg H₂/day, in an economical budget with a levelized cost of energy (LCOE) value of 0.079 $/kWh.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3aclimate change 3aexergy 3afossil fuels 3afuel cells 3afuel combustion 3agreenhouse gases 3ahydrogen 3amulti-criteria decision making 3arailroads 3asolar radiation 3atransportation industry 3awind power 3awind turbines 0aClimate change mitigation 0aIntegrated energy systems 0aSmart management 0aElectrified railway system1 aSafder, Usman1 aNguyen, Hai-Tra1 aLi, Qian1 aWoo, TaeYong1 aYoo, ChangKyoo0 tEnergy.g2021 Oct. 15, v. 233 p.121099-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2021.1210993Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01434naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002200149245017700171506002800348520039100376592002800767506003700795650002100832650001200853650002000865650001500885700002100900700002300921773009600944856008301040852000901123655001201132IND60739981820221207125014.0201009s2020    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073998182DNAL7 a10.1051/bioconf/202024000062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNatalia, Badmaeva10aWidening the area of a Baikal endemic Leymus secalinus (Georgi) Tzvelev.

Mar12aA first approach using micellar electrokinetic capillary chromatography for the determination of fipronil and fipronil‐sulfone in eggs  ap. 202-208.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aFipronil is an insecticide that is not approved in the European Union in food. In 2017, fipronil was involved in a European health alert due to its presence in fresh hen eggs because of an illicit use in poultry farms, so reliable methods are needed to determine fipronil and its main metabolites in these matrixes. In this work, we report the first approach to the study of fipronil and two metabolites, fipronil‐sulfone and fipronil‐sulfide by CE. MEKC mode was employed using a solution of 50 mM ammonium perfluorooctanoate pH 9.0 with 10% (v/v) methanol as background electrolyte. The proposed method was combined with a simple sample treatment based on salting‐out assisted LLE (SALLE) using acetonitrile as extraction solvent and ammonium sulfate as salt. The SALLE–MEKC–UV method allowed the simultaneous quantification of fipronil and fipronil‐sulfone. Validation parameters yielded satisfactory results, with precision, expressed as relative SD, below 14% and recoveries higher than 83%. Limits of detection were 90 µg/kg for fipronil and 150 µg/kg for fipronil‐sulfone, so in terms of sensitivity further studies of sample treatments allowing extra preconcentration or the use of more sensitive detection, such as MS, would be needed.  aPublisher supplied data  aCZ.02.1.01/0.0/0.0/15_003/0000465cEuropean Regional Development Fund  aFPU17/03810cMinisterio de Ciencia, Innovación y Universidades  aAGL2015‐70708‐RcSecretaría de Estado de Investigación, Desarrollo e Innovación  a2013/2cUniversidad de Granada 3aEuropean Union 3aacetonitrile 3aammonium 3aammonium sulfate 3adetection limit 3aeggs 3aelectrophoresis 3afarms 3afipronil 3ahens 3ainsecticides 3ametabolites 3amicellar electrokinetic capillary chromatography 3apH 3aperfluorooctanoic acid 3asolvents1 aLhotská, Ivona1 aGarcía‐Campaña, Ana M.1 aLara, Francisco J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7172-93230 tElectrophoresis.g2020 Feb., v. 41, no. 3-4 p.202-208dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3938548x0173-08357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/elps.2019002913Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02569naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245020600163300001400369520104900383592002801432650002101460650002201481650002401503650001301527650001101540650002701551650004401578650001301622650001301635650001501648653002801663653002401691653002601715653002701741653002201768653002401790700001101814700001601825700001401841700001201855700001301867700001901880773009801899856008101997852000902078655001202087IND60554140720221120143454.0161024e20140415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055414072DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bej.2014.01.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Xiaoxia10aSimultaneous in-situ excess sludge reduction and removal of organic carbon and nitrogen by a pilot-scale continuous aerobic–anaerobic coupled (CAAC) process for deeply treatment of soybean wastewater  ap. 30-37.  aA pilot-scale continuous aerobic–anaerobic coupled (CAAC) process was constructed and implemented for simultaneous excess sludge reduction and removal of organic carbon and nitrogen from the anaerobic effluent generated by an internal circulation (IC) reactor for treating soybean wastewater. When the hydraulic retention time (HRT) was shortened to 1.3 days, the average removal efficiencies for chemical oxygen demand (COD), NH4+–N, and total nitrogen (TN) reached 86%, 91%, and 67%, respectively. The mixed liquor suspended solids (MLSS) in the effluent generated by the CAAC process amounted to only 24mg/L on average. The sludge production rate was estimated to be 0.1582g MLSS/g COD, which is only 32% of that achieved by the conventional activated sludge process. The denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) analysis result showed that some fermentative and acetogenic bacteria were detected in anoxic and anaerobic zones. Such populations are associated with the anaerobic digestion and in-situ reduction of activated sludge.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactivated sludge 3aammonium nitrogen 3aanaerobic digestion 3abacteria 3acarbon 3achemical oxygen demand 3adenaturing gradient gel electrophoresis 3anitrogen 3asoybeans 3awastewater 0aExcess sludge reduction 0aMicrobial community 0aWaste-water treatment 0aMoving bed bioreactors 0aAerobic processes 0aAnaerobic processes1 aXu, Ke1 aFu, Weichao1 aWang, Jun1 aZhu, Yi1 aLi, Chun1 aZhou, Xiaohong0 tBiochemical engineering journal.g2014 Apr. 15, v. 85 p.30-37dElsevier B.V.x1369-703X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bej.2014.01.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02833naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002600144245006000170300001600230506002800246520133300274592002801607506003701635650001601672650002101688650001701709650001601726650002601742650000901768650002901777650002601806650001601832650001301848650001401861650001301875650001201888650001501900650001301915650002601928650000901954651001401963653001701977653001301994653001802007653001402025700002302039700001802062773013502080856007902215852000902294655001202303IND60739982120221207120250.0210330e202007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073998212DNAL7 a10.18343/jipi.25.3.4562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRochman, Rizal Dwinto10aExploration of Antibacteria from Soil Mold in Arboretum  ap. 456-461.  aResource is Open Access  aResearch to discover new antibacterial agent has been increasing due to the increasing number of pathogenic bacteria become antibiotic-resistant. Microbiomes in soil mold have antibacterial potency by producing secondary metabolites. The aim of this research was to isolate soil molds from the Faculty of Forestry Arboretum at IPB University. Arboretum’s soil was sampled ± 7.5 g from several points with maximum depth of 15 cm from surface. Mold isolate were cultivated for 28 days using waterbath shaker. Cultivated mycelium and soil filtrate were then separated and extracted using different methods and solvents, prior to antibacterial activity test using agar well diffusion method. Six isolates from Aspergillus, Penicillium, Paecilomyces, and Verticilium were used in this research. Cultivatation using sabouraud dextrose broth (SDB) contains pepton and dextrose in 25°C capable of stimulating mold growth. The research showed the result of secondary metabolit had antibacterial characteristic toward tested bacteria. The results of antibacterial activity test on both mycelium and soil filtrate extract showed that soil mold isolates had antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli. Isolate 103A originated from soil filtrate formed the largest inhibition zone on both tested pathogens.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAspergillus 3aEscherichia coli 3aPaecilomyces 3aPenicillium 3aStaphylococcus aureus 3aagar 3aantibacterial properties 3aantibiotic resistance 3aantibiotics 3aarboreta 3afiltrates 3aforestry 3aglucose 3amicrobiome 3amycelium 3asecondary metabolites 3asoil 3aIndonesia 0aantibacteria 0amycelium 0asoil filtrate 0asoil mold1 aSunartatie, Titiek1 aAfiff, Usamah0 tJurnal Ilmu Pertanian Indonesia.g2020 July, v. 25, no. 3 p.456-461dBogor Agricultural UniversitywJournal:27739x2443-34627nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.18343/jipi.25.3.4563Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02496naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100006100147245013100208300001200339520114100351592002801492650003201520650001901552650001301571650001601584650002501600650001201625650001101637650001901648650001701667650001601684650001201700650002801712650001801740653001701758653001301775653001601788653001801804653002801822700001401850773009601864856008101960852000902041655001202050IND60554140920221120153449.0161024e20140415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055414092DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bej.2014.01.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBradfield, M.F.A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7489-822910aContinuous succinic acid production by Actinobacillus succinogenes in a biofilm reactor: Steady-state metabolic flux variation  ap. 1-7.  aContinuous anaerobic fermentations were performed in a novel external-recycle, biofilm reactor using d-glucose and CO2 as carbon substrates. Succinic acid (SA) yields were found to be an increasing function of glucose consumption with the succinic acid to acetic acid ratio increasing from 2.4gg−1 at a glucose consumption of 10gL−1, to 5.7gg−1 at a glucose consumption of 50gL−1. The formic acid to acetic acid ratio decreased from an equimolar value (0.77gg−1) at a glucose consumption of 10gL−1 to a value close to zero at 50gL−1. The highest SA yield on glucose and highest SA titre obtained were 0.91gg−1 and 48.5gL−1 respectively. Metabolic flux analysis based on the established C3 and C4 metabolic pathways of Actinobacillus succinogenes revealed that the increase in the succinate to acetate ratio could not be attributed to the decrease in formic acid and that an additional source of NADH was present. The fraction of unaccounted NADH increased with glucose consumption, suggesting that additional reducing power is present in the medium or is provided by the activation of an alternative metabolic pathway.  aPublisher supplied data 3aActinobacillus succinogenes 3aNAD (coenzyme) 3aacetates 3aacetic acid 3abiochemical pathways 3abiofilm 3acarbon 3acarbon dioxide 3afermentation 3aformic acid 3aglucose 3ametabolic flux analysis 3asuccinic acid 0aFermentation 0aBiofilms 0aBioreactors 0aSuccinic acid 0aMetabolic flux analysis1 aNicol, W.0 tBiochemical engineering journal.g2014 Apr. 15, v. 85 p.1-7dElsevier B.V.x1369-703X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bej.2014.01.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02605naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004900094040001800143100002700161245013800188300001600326500000900342520127800351592002801629650001201657650002201669650001301691650001201704650001401716650001901730650001301749650001801762650001301780650000701793650001401800650002401814650002501838650000901863651001301872651001101885700002301896773014701919856009602066852000902162655001202171IND60668255120221120075456.0191125e199005  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066825512DNAL7 a10.2136/sssaj1990.03615995005400030047x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDonaldson, Jennifer M.10aNitrification Potential of Secondary-Succession Upland Oak Forests: I. Mineralization and Nitrification during Laboratory Incubations  ap. 892-897.  aepub  aExperiments were carried out to examine factors regulating N mineralization and nitrification in upland oak (Quercus spp.) forests of the Missouri Ozarks. Soils were collected from three sites representing secondary oak succession. Sampling dates represented different stages in the phenological development of the vegetation during a 1-yr period. Soils were incubated in the laboratory, and changes in soil NO₃- and NH₄-N were measured, along with changes in populations of autotrophic NH₄-oxidizing bacteria. The NO₃-production curves during laboratory incubation were used to calculate three variables that describe potential nitrification. These variables were lag prior to NO₃ accumulation, and initial rate and maximum rate of NO₃ production. This nitrification potential is greater in more mature oak stands. Multiple regression analyses of these data show that nitrification in these sites is indirectly regulated by soil NH₄-N availability and pH. However, the strong sampling-date effect on soil NH₄-N levels, lags in nitrification, and populations of NH₄-oxidizing bacteria suggest interactions between soil nitrification potential and possible inhibition by vegetation.

In the present study, BGM and PLC/PRF/5 cell lines were evaluated for TCVA and for their use in determining the incidence of adenoviruses and enteroviruses in raw sludge and Class B biosolids. Six raw sludge and 17 Class B biosolid samples were collected from 13 wastewater treatment plants from seven U.S. states. Samples were processed via organic flocculation and concentrate volumes equivalent to 4 g total solids were assayed on BGM and PLC/PRF/5 cells. Cell monolayers were observed for cytopathic effect (CPE) after two 14-days passages. Cell lysates were tested for the presence of adenoviruses and enteroviruses by PCR or RT-PCR. The PLC/PRF/5 cells detected more culturable viruses than the BGM cells by CPE (73.9% vs. 56.5%, respectively). 52% of the samples were positive for CPE using both cell lines. No viruses were detected in either cell line by PCR in flasks in which CPE was not observed. No adenoviruses were detected in 13 CPE-positive samples from BGM lysates. In contrast, of the 17 samples exhibiting CPE on PLC/PRF/5 cells, 14 were positive for adenoviruses (82.4%). In conclusion, PLC/PRF/5 cells were superior for the detection of adenoviruses in both raw sludge and Class B biosolids. Thus, the use of BGM cells alone for TCVA may underestimate the viral concentration in sludge/biosolid samples.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAdenoviridae 3aEnterovirus 3aUnited States Environmental Protection Agency 3abiosolids 3abuffaloes 3acell lines 3acytopathogenicity 3aflocculation 3amonkeys 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3asludge 3atotal solids 3aviruses 3awastewater treatment 3aUnited States1 aCastro-del Campo, Nohelia1 aGerba, Charles P.1 aPepper, Ian L.1 aBright, Kelly R.0 tFood and environmental virology.g2019 Mar., v. 11, no. 1 p.32-39dSpringer USwJournal:21446x1867-03347nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12560-019-09366-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03192naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002500150245014500175520177600320592002802096650001902124650001202143650002602155650001402181650001802195650001002213650001402223650001202237650001902249650001702268650001502285650002302300650001402323650001002337651001402347651000902361653001702370653002002387653001102407653002402418653001702442700003602459773013302495856008502628852000902713655001202722IND60680612220221118063602.0200217e20200315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068061222DNAL7 a10.1016/j.palaeo.2019.1095632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHamzeh, Mohammad Ali10aPalaeoenvironmental changes in the Khuran Estuary of SE coastal Iran during the last two millennia, based on the analysis of a sediment core  aLate Holocene palaeoenvironments of the northern Strait of Hormoz and the palaeohydrology of the SE Zagros were reconstructed using multi-proxy analysis (e.g. magnetic susceptibility (MS), grain size analysis, total organic matter %, CaCO₃%, C/N ratio, and foraminiferal assemblage) of a radiocarbon-dated sediment core (KHU) from the Khuran Estuary. High sedimentation rate (1.23 cm yr⁻¹) and elevated grain size, MS, C/N ratio, as well as the abundance of porcelaneous foraminifers (Quinqueloculina sp.), revealed that during the first three centuries CE, sediments settled in a relatively high accommodation space with strong tidal currents and raised terrigenous sediment input from the SE Zagros. About four centuries later, the gradual disappearance of porcelaneous taxa and the dominance of agglutinated and hyaline ones, besides the increasing C/N ratio, indicated that geomorphological conditions became favourable for mangroves. MS reduction and negative correlation between MS and grain size showed that during this period the relative proportion of terrigenous particles in sediment decreased which, in turn, confirms a reduction of river discharge. Afterwards, the abundance of mud aggregates, low C/N ratio and a dramatic reduction of foraminifers showed that a < 1 m thick sediment unit representing a relatively long period (1.4 cal kyr BP onwards; sedimentation rate: 0.06 cm yr⁻¹) was deposited within a high marsh environment being mostly above mean high water. Generally, correlations between proxy records of the core KHU with Zagros lakes and other archives from African lakes and Greenland re-inforce the reconstruction of atmospheric teleconnection between the North Atlantic and the interior of West Asia during the late Holocene.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHolocene epoch 3aRetaria 3acarbon nitrogen ratio 3aestuaries 3ageomorphology 3alakes 3amagnetism 3amarshes 3aorganic matter 3apaleoecology 3ariver flow 3asedimentation rate 3asediments 3atides 3aGreenland 3aIran 0aPersian Gulf 0aPalaeohydrology 0aZagros 0aEstuarine evolution 0aForaminifera1 aFarahi Ghasr-Aboonasr, Sedigheh0 tPalaeogeography, palaeoclimatology, palaeoecology.g2020 Mar. 15, v. 542 p.109563-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:2694x0031-01827nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.palaeo.2019.1095633Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01800naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002300149245011500172300001800287520056300305592002800868650001400896650001400910650002300924650002300947650001100970650001400981650001200995650001601007650002001023700001901043700002001062700002701082700002001109700002101129700002601150700001601176773010401192856008501296852000901381655001201390IND60579274720221120194255.0170816e20160506xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057927472DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.orglett.6b009392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFallon, Brendan

This study assessed the spatial and temporal variations of regional ET in response to P extremes, for various types of land-cover across the Youngsan River basin in Korea.The spatial distribution of monthly P and ET from 2001 to 2009 were estimated using rainfall records from 40 weather stations located across the basin and a satellite-derived, process-based ET model Breathing Earth System Simulator (BESS) (Ryu et al., 2011), respectively. The study periods were focused on the recent years with abnormally large, small and normal P, which were identified from anomalies in the z-sores of long-term (1973–2011) rainfall records. The variation of regional ET was assessed in terms of: (1) the controlling factors, using the statistics of related meteorological and geographical data, (2) a water-energy balance, using Budyko’s framework, and (3) the water balance of four selected watersheds in the region, using the partitioning of annual P into ET and riverflow discharge (Q).The total annual ET of this region decreased in abnormally large-P year and increased in small-P year, because the ET in July to August (which accounts for more than 36% of annual ET) was limited by the available energy rather than available water due to the summer monsoon. In terms of land cover types, forests showed larger interannual variability in ET than paddy fields or cropland, with the differences in ET between large and small-P years being 108 and 82mmyr−1, respectively. The sensitivity of annual ET to P extremes was significantly related to the leaf area index (LAI), rather than soil properties, topography, or specific land-cover type (p<0.05, generalized linear model). However, the interannual variations of ET were not large (15–18%) compared to those of annual P (51–62%) and Q (108–232%) during 2002–2009. Thus, vegetation played a consistent role in releasing water back to the regional atmosphere through ET, regardless of P extremes.  aPublisher supplied data 3asoil properties 3aleaf area index 3awatersheds 3asummer 3aforests 3atopography 3alinear models 3amonsoon season 3acase studies 3abreathing 3atemporal variation 3abasins 3aenergy 3aEarth system science 3aland cover 3aweather stations 3apaddies 3awater resources 3astatistics 3aevapotranspiration 3acropland 3arain 3aKorean Peninsula 0aClimate extremes 0aWater balance 0aMODIS 0awater balance 0aEvapotranspiration 0aBudyko curve1 aRyu, Youngryel1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6238-24791 aJeon, Soohyun0 tJournal of hydrology.g2014 Nov. 27, v. 519 p.3531-3540dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl46539x0022-16947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2014.10.0483Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01332naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245010500159300002000264520035400284592002800638650001400666650001100680650001500691650001400706700001800720700002500738700002300763700002400786773012500810856007400935852000901009655001201018IND60666818820221116231641.0190919e20140918xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066681882DNAL7 a10.1039/c4ra08542f2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOhsedo, Yutaka12aA new composite thixotropic hydrogel composed of a low-molecular-weight hydrogelator and a nanosheet  ap. 44837-44840.  aA two-component composite comprised of a low-molecular-weight hydrogelator and the nanosheet Laponite®, a synthetic layered silicate, showed thixotropic behaviour, whereas each single component did not show thixotropic behaviour at the same concentration.

In contrast to other members of the P-element superfamily, it has unusually long terminal inverted-repeats (TIRs) that resemble those of Foldback elements. To investigate the function of the long TIRs we derived consensus and ancestral sequences for the Galileo transposase in three species of Drosophilids. Following gene synthesis, we expressed and purified their constituent THAP domains and tested their binding activity towards the respective Galileo TIRs. DNase I footprinting located the most proximal DNA binding site about 70bp from the transposon end. Using this sequence we identified further binding sites in the tandem repeats that are found within the long TIRs. This suggests that the synaptic complex between Galileo ends may be a complicated structure containing higher-order multimers of the transposase. We also attempted to reconstitute Galileo transposition in Drosophila embryos but no events were detected. Thus, although the limited numbers of Galileo copies in each genome were sufficient to provide functional consensus sequences for the THAP domains, they do not specify a fully active transposase. Since the THAP recognition sequence is short, and will occur many times in a large genome, it seems likely that the multiple binding sites within the long, internally repetitive, TIRs of Galileo and other Foldback-like elements may provide the transposase with its binding specificity.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDNA 3aDrosophila 3abinding sites 3adeoxyribonuclease I 3agenes 3atandem repeat sequences 3atransposons 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAnimals 2aBinding Sites 2aConsensus Sequence 2aDNA Footprintingxmethods 2aDNA Transposable Elements 2aDrosophila 2aDrosophila Proteinsxgenetics 2aGenome 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aProtein Structure, Tertiary 2aSequence Alignment 2aTerminal Repeat Sequences 2aTransposasesxgenetics 0aTIR 0abp 0akb 0aMBP-tag 0aEMSA 0aORF 0aBS 0aDbuz 0aDmoj 0aDana 0aP-element 0aFoldback 0aTHAP domain 0aDNA binding 0aEvolution1 aLiu, Danxu1 aRuiz, Alfredo1 aChalmers, Ronald0 tGene.g2013 Aug. 01, v. 525 p.84-91dElsevier B.V.x0378-11197nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gene.2013.04.0503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02487naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245013500169300001600304520097000320592002801290650002801318650001201346650001501358650001501373650002201388650001901410650002501429650002301454650001201477650001601489650002401505650000701529650001401536653001401550653002201564653001501586653001301601653001601614653001401630700002001644700002001664700002301684700003001707700002401737700001801761773010001779856008101879852000901960655001201969IND60554141120221120123112.0161024e20140415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055414112DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bej.2014.01.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMarković, Milica10aMicrowave as a pre-treatment of triticale for bioethanol fermentation and utilization of the stillage for lactic acid fermentation  ap. 132-138.  aThe aims of this research were to investigate the potential for improvement of bioethanol fermentation by microwave pre-treatment of triticale, as well as the possibility of using triticale stillage (a by-product of bioethanol fermentation) as a suitable medium for lactic acid fermentation, either without or with the optimal addition of CaCO3. The results showed that an adequate microwave pre-treatment (270 and 450W) marginally improved bioethanol production, giving a slightly higher yield of the bioethanol produced (by 3.95%). Lactobacillus fermentum PL-1 was used for subsequent lactic acid fermentation of the stillage that remained after bioethanol fermentation. Results showed higher pH decrease and higher acidity in the samples without the addition of CaCO3. Consequently, higher concentrations of l- and d-lactic acid were determined in the samples with the addition of CaCO3, as well as better viability of cells and the complete glucose utilization.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLactobacillus fermentum 3aacidity 3abioethanol 3abyproducts 3acalcium carbonate 3acell viability 3aethanol fermentation 3aethanol production 3aglucose 3alactic acid 3alactic fermentation 3apH 3atriticale 0aTriticale 0aBioprocess design 0aBioethanol 0aStillage 0aLactic acid 0aViability1 aMarkov, Siniša1 aGrujić, Olgica1 aMojović, Ljiljana1 aKocić-Tanackov, Sunčica1 aVukašinović, Maja1 aPejin, Jelena0 tBiochemical engineering journal.g2014 Apr. 15, v. 85 p.132-138dElsevier B.V.x1369-703X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bej.2014.01.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01726naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094024002200131024001900153040001800172100001900190245005800209300001800267506007600285520058100361592002800942506003700970650002001007650003201027650002301059650002501082650002301107650002001130700002801150773010401178856008501282852000901367655001201376IND60579274820221207045207.0170816e20160506xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057927482DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.orglett.6b009422doi7 aPMC53285892pmcid7 a271163182pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGhosh, Arun K.10aEnantioselective Total Synthesis of (+)-Amphirionin-4  ap. 2296-2299.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aAn enantioselective total synthesis of (+)-amphirionin-4 has been accomplished in a convergent manner.

Compost products with greater C concentrations resulted in greater soil improvements. Particulate organic matter C was the index most responsive to compost addition. Mature composts with greater C concentrations and dry matter were most suitable. Soil quality has declined with intensive potato production practices in New Brunswick, Canada. Compost application may rapidly increase soil organic matter (SOM) and reverse declining productivity. This study assessed five diverse compost products for their short‐term effects on soil quality, and in particular SOM. Selected compost products derived from a range of forestry, marine, and municipal waste materials were compared with a non‐amended control. Treatments were applied to field plots at 45 Mg ha–¹ dry weight in October of 2014 and 2015. Biological, chemical and physical soil properties under potato production in 2015 and 2016 (after one and after two consecutive applications) were used to evaluate soil quality. Compost application increased soil pH and concentrations of Mehlich‐3 extractable nutrients (K, Ca, Mg, and S). Compost reduced bulk density in the potato hill by 8% in both years. Particulate organic matter (POM) was the most sensitive indicator to compost‐application with twofold increases in POM‐C. Compost application increased soil organic carbon by 24% in 2016 and also increased permanganate oxidizable carbon, and soil respiration. Several soil properties were strongly correlated with compost composition, with better quality composts (i.e., more mature; greater in C, N, and other plant‐available nutrient concentrations) producing the greatest soil quality response. Overall, mature composts with greater C concentrations (i.e., low ash) and greater dry matter were most suitable for enhancing soil quality in New Brunswick potato production systems.  aPublisher supplied data  cPotatoes New Brunswick, NSERC  cAgriculture and Agri‐Food Canada 3abulk density 3acalcium 3acomposts 3acrop production 3aforestry 3ahills 3amagnesium 3anutrient content 3anutrients 3aparticulate organic matter 3apotassium 3apotatoes 3aproduction technology 3asoil organic carbon 3asoil pH 3asoil quality 3asoil respiration 3awastes 3aNew Brunswick1 aZebarth, Bernie J.1 aBurton, David L.1 aGoyer, Claudia0 tSoil Science Society of America journal.g2018 July, v. 82, no. 4 p.889-900dThe Soil Science Society of America, Inc.wJournal:jnl44580x0361-59957nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2136/sssaj2017.10.03453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02453naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002000152245015900172300001400331520100400345592002801349650002101377650001001398650001401408650002101422650001301443650001401456650001901470650001301489650002801502650002301530650001201553650000701565650001201572650002401584653002901608653002001637653001901657653003601676700001801712700002001730700002801750773010901778856008701887852000901974655001201983IND60525659720221118031011.0190318e201601  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052565972DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jfoodeng.2015.08.0202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTruong, Binh Q.10aHigh pressure processing of barramundi (Lates calcarifer) muscle before freezing: The effects on selected physicochemical properties during frozen storage  ap. 72-78.  aThe effects of high pressure processing (HPP) on barramundi muscle at 0.1 MPa (control), 150 MPa, 200 MPa, 250 MPa and 300 MPa at 11 ± 2 °C for 3 min were studied before and after immediate blast freezing and storage at −18 °C for up to 18 weeks. Physicochemical measurements including colour, texture profile, drip loss, pH, free fatty acids and thiobarbituric acid (TBA) values were carried out. HPP at 200 MPa significantly increased hardness and delayed lipid oxidation during frozen storage (for up to 18 weeks) without resulting in a cooked appearance of barramundi muscle. However, drip loss of barramundi muscle pressurised at 200 MPa was similar to control samples and during frozen storage. Application of pressures higher than 250 MPa for 3 min resulted in the loss of visual freshness and increased drip loss of barramundi muscle. Thus, application of HPP at an appropriate level (150–200 MPa) before freezing could improve the quality of frozen barramundi muscle.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLates calcarifer 3acolor 3adrip loss 3afree fatty acids 3afreezing 3afreshness 3afrozen storage 3ahardness 3ahigh pressure treatment 3alipid peroxidation 3amuscles 3apH 3atexture 3athiobarbituric acid 0aHigh pressure processing 0aBarramundi fish 0aFrozen storage 0aPhysicochemical characteristics1 aBuckow, Roman1 aNguyen, Minh H.1 aStathopoulos, Costas E.0 tJournal of food engineering.g2016 Jan., v. 169 p.72-78dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl34294x0260-87747nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jfoodeng.2015.08.0203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02028naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002000152245008600172300001400258520072900272592002801001650002101029650001901050650001201069650001401081650001601095650002001111650001801131650001301149650000901162650001601171653003901187653002101226653001401247653000901261653001701270700001801287700002301305700002201328700001901350700001901369773008601388856008701474852000901561655001201570IND60634830220221122065417.0190516e201904  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063483022DNAL7 a10.1016/j.anaerobe.2019.02.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlsubaie, Sarah10aFinegoldia magna causing intramedullary thoracic spinal cord abscess in an infant  ap. 57-60.  aSpinal intramedullary abscesses are rare and potentially devastating lesions. Infection is mostly caused by staphylococci. Anaerobes are rare and often polymicrobial. We report an unusual case of spinal cord intramedullary abscess in a 7-month-old infant with monomicrobial infection due to Finegoldia magna. She was found to have a missed congenital thoracic dermal sinus. The patient was treated with metronidazole and ceftriaxone for 8 weeks, and improvement of the infection was documented. Clinical awareness of patients at risk is crucial for early diagnosis and intervention. As detection methods continue to improve for Finegoldia magna, it is important to increase awareness of the pathogenic role of this organism.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFinegoldia magna 3aStaphylococcus 3aabscess 3aanaerobes 3aceftriaxone 3aearly diagnosis 3ametronidazole 3apatients 3arisk 3aspinal cord 0aIntramedullary spinal cord abscess 0aFinegoldia magna 0aAnaerobes 0aIASC 0aMALDI-TOF MS1 aDolgum, Saeed1 aBinkhamis, Khalifa1 aAlweijri, Ikhlass1 aBugshan, Amani1 aAlzamil, Fahad0 tAnaerobe.g2019 Apr., v. 56 p.57-60dElsevier LtdwJournal:12008x1075-99647nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.anaerobe.2019.02.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02744naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245016800168520123900336592002801575650003701603650002201640650001201662650004901674650002201723650001701745650001801762650002201780650002201802650000901824650001301833650001401846650000701860650002101867650001601888653001201904653001901916653002201935653001401957653001701971700001401988700001602002700001202018700001902030773010702049856008502156852000902241655001202250IND60682313420221123005907.0200809e202006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068231342DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envpol.2020.1140202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYan, Jingchun10aNano-magnetite supported by biochar pyrolyzed at different temperatures as hydrogen peroxide activator: Synthesis mechanism and the effects on ethylbenzene removal  aNano-magnetite supported by biochar (nFe₃O₄/BC) pyrolyzed at temperatures of 300 °C–600 °C was developed to activate hydrogen peroxide (H₂O₂) for the efficient degradation of ethylbenzene in aqueous solution. It was revealed that the degradation efficiency of ethylbenzene and TOC removal were 96.9% and 36.2% respectively after the reaction for 40 min in the presence of initial concentration of 0.1 mmol L⁻¹ ethylbenzene, 2.76 g L⁻¹ nFe₃O₄/BC₅₀₀ with the mass ratio of nFe₃O₄ to BC₅₀₀ of 4:1 and 2.0 mmol L⁻¹ H₂O₂ at pH 7.0. Based on electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), quenching experiment and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) data, both OH and O₂⁻ radicals were generated in the nFe₃O₄/BC₅₀₀ activated H₂O₂ system, and the OH radicals were the predominant species for the degradation of ethylbenzene. Through electron transfer process, mechanisms of Fe(II), phenolic hydroxyl group and persistent free radicals (PFRs) on BC surfaces accounted for the generation of OH radicals, and Fe(III) in nFe₃O₄ and formed from Fe(II) oxidation responsible for the generation of O₂⁻ radicals in the nFe₃O₄/BC activated H₂O₂ system were proposed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aaqueous solutions 3abiochar 3aelectron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aelectron transfer 3aethylbenzene 3afree radicals 3ahydrogen peroxide 3ahydroxyl radicals 3airon 3amoieties 3aoxidation 3apH 3asuperoxide anion 3atemperature 0aBiochar 0aNano-magnetite 0aHydrogen peroxide 0aCatalysis 0aEthylbenzene1 aYang, Lei1 aQian, Linbo1 aHan, Lu1 aChen, Mengfang0 tEnvironmental pollution.g2020 June, v. 261 p.114020-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl41014x0269-74917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2020.1140203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04032naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094024002200134024001900156040001800175100002600193245015900219300001400378506007600392520208600468592002802554506003702582650002202619650002602641650002702667650001502694650002602709650001802735650001502753650000902768650001402777650002602791650001102817650001602828650001602844650002002860650001602880650001702896650001602913650001502929650001402944650001802958650001702976650001402993650001003007653003203017653001703049653001803066653003703084700002303121700002603144700001903170700002303189773008603212856008703298852000903385655001203394IND60634830320221207123839.0190516e201904  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063483032DNAL7 a10.1016/j.anaerobe.2019.02.0052doi7 aPMC65597362pmcid7 a307538982pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPetrina, Melinda A.B.10aSusceptibility of endometrial isolates recovered from women with clinical pelvic inflammatory disease or histological endometritis to antimicrobial agents  ap. 61-65.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe CDC recommended outpatient treatment of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) is an intramuscular dose of ceftriaxone plus 14 days of doxycycline, with or without metronidazole. European guidelines (2017) include moxifloxacin plus ceftriaxone as a first line regimen, particularly for women with Mycoplasma genitalium-associated PID. However, the susceptibility of bacteria recovered from the endometrium of women with PID to moxifloxacin is unknown. The in vitro antibiotic susceptibility of facultative and anaerobic bacteria recovered from endometrial biopsy samples were evaluated from 105 women having symptomatic PID and/or histologically confirmed endometritis. A total of 342 endometrial isolates from enrollment visits were identified using a combination of biochemical tests and sequencing. Isolates were tested for antimicrobial susceptibility using agar dilution against ceftriaxone, clindamycin, doxycycline, metronidazole and moxifloxacin according to the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines. Neisseria gonorrhoeae was susceptible to ceftriaxone with all isolates having an MIC of 0.03 μg/mL. All the other endometrial isolates were susceptible to ceftriaxone, except for Prevotella species, only half of which were susceptible. The in vitro susceptibility profile for BV-associated bacteria (Gardnerella vaginalis, Atopobium vaginae, Prevotella species, Porphyromonas species and anaerobic gram-positive cocci) revealed greater susceptibility to moxifloxacin compared to doxycycline. Moxifloxacin was superior to metronidazole for G. vaginalis and A. vaginae, and either metronidazole or moxifloxacin was needed to cover Prevotella species. Based on in vitro susceptibility testing, the combination of ceftriaxone plus moxifloxacin provides similar coverage of facultative and anaerobic pathogens compared to the combination of ceftriaxone, metronidazole and doxycycline. Head to head clinical studies of these treatment regimens are needed to evaluate clinical efficacy and eradication of endometrial pathogens following treatment.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAtopobium vaginae 3aGardnerella vaginalis 3aGram-positive bacteria 3aMycoplasma 3aNeisseria gonorrhoeae 3aPorphyromonas 3aPrevotella 3aagar 3aanaerobes 3aantibiotic resistance 3abiopsy 3aceftriaxone 3aclindamycin 3aclinical trials 3adoxycycline 3aendometritis 3aendometrium 3aguidelines 3ahistology 3ametronidazole 3amoxifloxacin 3apathogens 3awomen 0aPelvic inflammatory disease 0aMoxifloxacin 0aMetronidazole 0aMinimal inhibitory concentration1 aCosentino, Lisa A.1 aWiesenfeld, Harold C.1 aDarville, Toni1 aHillier, Sharon L.0 tAnaerobe.g2019 Apr., v. 56 p.61-65dElsevier LtdwJournal:12008x1075-99647nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.anaerobe.2019.02.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04466naa a2200733 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002200094024001900116024003500135040001800170100002700188245010800215300001200323506007600335520233400411592002802745506003702773650002402810650001502834650000802849650002002857650003402877650002602911650001502937650001302952650001702965650001002982650002202992650000903014650001503023650001103038650001003049650001503059650002403074650001403098650001403112650003003126650001803156650001703174650001603191650001203207650001703219650001003236650001103246650002603257650001403283650001703297650001103314651001003325700002703335700001903362700003203381700001603413700002503429700002903454700002003483700001803503773010803521856008203629852000903711655001203720IND60572289120221207053548.0220818e201712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057228912DNAL7 aPMC53468312pmcid7 a282855902pmid7 a10.1186/s13071-017-2056-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDíaz-Regañón, David10aMolecular detection of Hepatozoon spp. and Cytauxzoon sp. in domestic and stray cats from Madrid, Spain  ap. 112.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Different species of apicomplexan protozoans of the genera Hepatozoon and Cytauxzoon can infect domestic cats, but their epidemiology and clinical relevance are not fully understood. The aim of this study was to assess the molecular prevalence of Hepatozoon spp. and Cytauxzoon spp. and to identify associated risk factors and clinical and laboratory abnormalities in a population of cats from Madrid, Spain. METHODS: Six hundred and forty-four client-owned and stray cats from Madrid, Spain, were included in this study. DNA samples were analyzed by two polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests to detect a partial sequence of the 18S rRNA gene of Hepatozoon spp. and Cytauxzoon spp. In order to evaluate possible associations between infection by these protozoans and epidemiological or clinical parameters, data were collected related to: the season of sample collection, age, gender, spayed/neutered status, breed, living area, lifestyle, outdoor access, contact with other animals, prey on wild animals, history of tick or flea infestation, travel history, ectoparasiticide treatment, previous blood transfusion, previous tetracycline administration in the last 60 days, Feline Leukemia virus (FeLV) and Feline Immunodeficiency virus (FIV) status, positivity to other vector-borne diseases, the presence or absence of clinical signs and hematological or biochemical alterations. RESULTS: DNA of Hepatozoon spp. and Cytauxzoon sp. was amplified from the blood of 10 (1.6%) and 8 (1.2%) cats, respectively. Previous treatment with tetracyclines in the last 60 days, previous administration of blood transfusion, a decrease in haematocrit and an increase in creatinine were associated with Hepatozoon spp. infection. Cytauxzoon sp. infection was more frequent in samples collected during the winter months and in cats living in rural areas. This infection was associated with a FIV-positive status. Some of the cats that were positive for Hepatozoon spp. or Cytauxzoon sp. had been exposed to other vector-borne pathogens, such as Ehrlichia canis and Bartonella henselae. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that cats from Madrid, central Spain, are infected with Hepatozoon spp. and Cytauxzoon sp., although with a low prevalence. Further studies are needed to determine the virulence of these agents in Spanish cats.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aBartonella henselae 3aCytauxzoon 3aDNA 3aEhrlichia canis 3aFeline immunodeficiency virus 3aFeline leukemia virus 3aHepatozoon 3aProtozoa 3aSiphonaptera 3ablood 3ablood transfusion 3acats 3acreatinine 3agender 3agenes 3ahematocrit 3ainsect infestations 3alifestyle 3apathogens 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aribosomal RNA 3arisk factors 3arural areas 3aspaying 3atetracycline 3aticks 3atravel 3avector-borne diseases 3avirulence 3awild animals 3awinter 3aSpain1 aVillaescusa, Alejandra1 aAyllón, Tania1 aRodríguez-Franco, Fernando1 aBaneth, Gad1 aCalleja-Bueno, Lydia1 aGarcía-Sancho, Mercedes1 aAgulla, Beatriz1 aSainz, Ángel0 tParasites & vectors.g2017 Dec., v. 10, no. 1 p.112-112dBioMed CentralwJournal:24143x1756-33057nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13071-017-2056-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03914naa a2201069 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245022000172520128800392592002801680650002501708650002001733650001601753650002001769650001101789650001801800650001201818650004301830650001301873650002001886650001501906650001301921650001301934650002301947653000901970653000801979653000801987653000801995653001002003653000902013653001002022653001002032653000902042653000702051653000702058653001302065653000702078653000802085653000802093653000802101653000802109653000902117653000902126653000902135653000902144653001002153653000802163653000802171653000902179653000802188653000802196653000802204653000702212653000702219653000802226653001602234653000902250653001102259653000902270653001702279653001002296653001602306653000702322653000702329653000802336653000802344653000602352653000802358653000702366653001202373653000702385653000802392653000902400653001002409653004402419653001602463653002502479653001302504653002302517653002002540700001802560700002302578700002402601773011202625856008602737852000902823655001202832IND60653826720221117081547.0190725e20190901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065382672DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jchromb.2019.1217202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZilfidou, Eirini13aAn improved fabric phase sorptive extraction method for the determination of five selected antidepressant drug residues in human blood serum prior to high performance liquid chromatography with diode array detection  aFabric phase sorptive extraction (FPSE), a recently introduced sorbent-based microextraction technique, was applied for the first time in order to achieve a simple and rapid simultaneous extraction of five common antidepressant drug residues (venlafaxine, paroxetine, fluoxetine, amitriptyline and clomipramine) from human blood serum. Elimination of protein precipitation step and minimized solvent consumption led to a sample preparation workflow compliant with the principles of green analytical chemistry (GAC). FPSE utilizes permeable and flexible fabric substrate chemically coated with a sol-gel organic-inorganic hybrid sorbent as the extraction device. Among all the membrane examined, sol-gel polycaprolactone-dimethylsiloxane-polycaprolactone coated polyester substrate presented optimum extraction efficiency and was found to be reusable for at least 30 times. The selected drugs were analyzed and detected by reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography method using gradient elution and a diode array detector operated at 235 nm. Limit of detection was found 0.15 ng μL−1, while good absolute recoveries (9.4–88.1%) and low relative standard deviations (≤9.2% and ≤ 11.0 for within-day and between-day precision, respectively) were obtained.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanalytical chemistry 3aantidepressants 3ablood serum 3adetection limit 3adiodes 3adrug residues 3afabrics 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3alactones 3amicroextraction 3apolyesters 3asolvents 3asorbents 3astandard deviation 0aFPSE 0aGAC 0aWHO 0aADs 0aMAOIs 0aTCAs 0aSSRIs 0aSNRIs 0aHPLC 0aGC 0aCP 0aUV–Vis 0aMS 0aDAD 0aPDA 0aLLE 0aSPE 0aSPME 0aSBSE 0aMSPE 0aMEPS 0aDLLME 0aVEN 0aPAR 0aAMIT 0aCLO 0aFLU 0aACN 0aMQ 0aCL 0aPEG 0aPEG-PPG-PEG 0aPTHF 0aPDMDPS 0aPDMS 0aPCL-PDMS-PCL 0aMPTMS 0aPEO-PPO-PEO 0aPL 0aQC 0aLOD 0aLOQ 0aR 0aRSD 0aSD 0aHF-LPME 0aFD 0aNPD 0aNACE 0aBAμE 0aFabric phase sorptive extraction (FPSE) 0aBlood serum 0aAntidepressant drugs 0aHPLC-DAD 0aSample preparation 0aMicroextraction1 aKabir, Abuzar1 aFurton, Kenneth G.1 aSamanidou, Victoria0 tJournal of chromatography.g2019 Sept. 01, v. 1125 p.121720-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12459x1570-02327nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jchromb.2019.1217203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03019naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245014700171520157100318592002801889650001501917650002201932650001201954650002201966650002201988650001802010650002902028650001702057650000702074650001602081650000902097650002302106653002802129653002202157653001402179653002202193653001802215700005702233700001902290700002102309700001802330773011802348856008602466852000902552655001202561IND60763935520221120094602.0220606e20220401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076393552DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jenvman.2022.1145232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAnil Kumar, K.,10aFunctionalized Cu-based metal oxide nanoparticles with enhanced Cd+2 adsorption capacity and their ecotoxicity assessment by molecular docking  aIn the present study, synthesis of eco-friendly Cu-based metal oxides nanoparticles [CuO, Cu₂O, and CuO&Cu₂O nanoparticles (NPs)] without and with functionalization with Diethylene glycol (DEG) has been demonstrated. The synthesized NPs were screened for their ability to adsorb multiple heavy metal ions from an aqueous solution. Based on the maximum Cadmium (Cd⁺²) ion adsorption capacity, functionalized Cu₂O (fCu₂O) NPs were selected for the detailed characterization and batch studies. The average size of fCu₂O NPs was found to be 57.4 ± 6.14 nm in comparison to NPs without capping (72.6 ± 5.19 nm). The experimental parameters viz. contact time, initial pH, and initial concentration were optimized, and the obtained results were interpreted using standard isotherms and kinetic models. The maximum Cd⁺² adsorption on fCu₂O NPs was observed at initial solution pH 7. The adsorption of Cd⁺² was found to be decreased at acidic pH due to the protonation of functional groups present on the NPs surface. A maximum Cd⁺² adsorption capacity of 204 ± 6.2 mg g⁻¹ was obtained from the Langmuir adsorption isotherm. The crystal structure of NPs was prepared and docked with the protein targets of selected soil microbes in order to determine their ecotoxicity. The obtained results showed that NPs exhibited low affinity towards protein targets in comparison to the standard used. It suggests that NPs have less impact on the functionality of soil microbes and are thus safe for their disposal into the soil micro-environment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3aaqueous solutions 3acadmium 3acrystal structure 3adiethylene glycol 3aecotoxicology 3aenvironmental management 3aheavy metals 3apH 3aprotonation 3asoil 3asorption isotherms 0aFunctionalized Cu2O NPs 0aDiethylene glycol 0aCd+2 ions 0aMolecular docking 0aSoil microbes1 aYeshwanth, M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3355-73611 aKumar B, Kusum1 aPanwar, Jitendra1 aGupta, Suresh0 tJournal of environmental management.g2022 Apr. 01, v. 307 p.114523-dElsevier LtdwJournal:2018x0301-47977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2022.1145233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02959naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001800145245011300163300001800276520139600294592002801690650001501718650001501733650001101748650002201759650001701781650001701798650003101815650001101846650002701857650002201884650002001906650001101926650002001937650001701957700005401974700001702028700005702045700001602102700001302118700001402131700001702145700002002162700005602182773013902238856007902377852000902456655001202465IND60645965820221119050252.0190604e20190516xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064596582DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.est.9b006622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Shiyong10aMembrane-Free Hybrid Capacitive Deionization System Based on Redox Reaction for High-Efficiency NaCl Removal  ap. 6292-6301.  aCapacitive deionization (CDI) is a promising technology for desalination due to its advantages of low driven energy and environmental friendliness. However, the ion removal capacity (IRC) of CDI is insufficient for practical application because such a capacity is limited by the available surface area of the carbon electrode for ion absorption. Thus, the development of a novel desalination technology with high IRC and low cost is vital. Here, a membrane-free hybrid capacitive deionization system (HCDI) with hollow carbon@MnO₂ (HC@MnO₂) to capture sodium via redox reaction and hollow carbon sphere with net positive surface charges (PHC) for chloride adsorption is introduced. The as-obtained HC@MnO₂ with unique structure and high conductivity can improve the utilization of MnO₂ pseudocapacitive electrodes. Meanwhile, the PHC can selectively adsorb Cl– and prevent the adsorption of Na⁺ due to electrostatic repulsion. As expected, the membrane-free HCDI system demonstrates excellent desalination performance. The system’s IRC and maximum removal rate are 30.7 mg g–¹ and 7.8 mg g–¹ min–¹, respectively. Moreover, the proposed system has a low cost because of the absence of expensive ion exchange membranes (IEM), which is suitable for practical application. The excellent performance of this HCDI makes it a promising desalination technology for future use.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3aadsorption 3acarbon 3acarbon electrodes 3adeionization 3adesalination 3aelectrostatic interactions 3aenergy 3aion-exchange membranes 3amanganese dioxide 3aredox reactions 3asodium 3asodium chloride 3asurface area1 aWang, Gang1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3185-12681 aWu, Tingting1 aLi, Changping1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1084-40231 aWang, Yuwei1 aPan, Xin1 aZhan, Fei1 aZhang, Yunqi1 aWang, Shuaifeng1 aQiu, Jieshan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6291-37910 tEnvironmental science & technology.g2019 May 16, v. 53, no. 11 p.6292-6301dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23339x1520-58517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.9b006623Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02687naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100006200146245019700208300001800405500001900423520138500442592002801827650002201855650001501877650001201892650003001904650000901934650001601943650002201959700001901981700002002000700006002020700002002080773013602100856008002236852000902316655001202325IND60733000320221118034421.0210402e20210316xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073300032DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.1c011712doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYokoyama, Tomoyasu1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8993-768110aLow-Cost Computing of the Thermophysical Properties of Organic–Inorganic Halide Perovskites by Density Functional Theory Combined with the Three-Dimensional Reference Interaction Site Method  ap. 6601-6610.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aOrganic–inorganic hybrid materials (OIHMs) represented by methylammonium lead triiodide (MAPbI₃) and formamidinium lead triiodide (FAPbI₃), which are the absorption layer of perovskite solar cells, have attracted much attention. However, it is difficult to calculate the properties of OIHMs by density functional theory (DFT) in terms of computational cost because the organic molecules rotate within the inorganic framework at finite temperature. Here, using cubic MAPbI₃ as an example, we demonstrate the reduction of the computational cost for OIHMs by DFT combined with the three-dimensional reference interaction site method (3D-RISM). The RISM was developed to simulate the structures and reactions at the interface of solids and liquids. By treating the MA cation as a pseudoliquid, we successfully reproduced the distribution of the MA cation experimentally observed at a finite temperature. When the RISM temperature was changed, the thermal expansion coefficient and temperature dependence of the band gap of MAPbI₃ were predicted, and they were in good agreement with experimental reports. In addition, the lattice constant, the bandgap, and free energy of mixing of MA₁–ₓFAₓPbI₃ can be evaluated by DFT/3D-RISM without using a supercell. Therefore, this method makes the evaluation of thermophysical properties without high-cost computing possible.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGibbs free energy 3aabsorption 3acations 3adensity functional theory 3alead 3atemperature 3athermal expansion1 aOhuchi, Satoru1 aMatsui, Taisuke1 aKaneko, Yukihiro1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0000-58401 aSasagawa, Takao0 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2021 Mar. 16, v. 125, no. 12 p.6601-6610dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23573x1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.1c011713Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04389naa a2200853 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100002000166245013000186300001800316520166400334592002801998650001902026650002502045650001002070650001602080650000902096650002502105650002602130650002402156650001302180650001002193650001202203650001002215650001202225650001602237650001002253650002402263650004302287650000902330650002802339650002102367650004602388650001202434650003002446650002302476650000902499650003702508650003902545650005602584650003102640650001902671650003502690650003702725650000902762650005502771650002902826650002702855650000902882650001702891650004002908650004202948650004002990650003803030650002503068700002903093700003203122700002703154700002003181700001803201700002303219700002003242700001803262700002203280700002503302773010603327856008103433852000903514655001203523IND50070724220221122062106.0150210e201312  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007072422DNAL7 a232696532pmid7 a10.1007/s00394-012-0488-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKarsenty, Julie10aBeneficial effects of omega-3 fatty acids on the consequences of a fructose diet are not mediated by PPAR delta or PGC1 alpha  ap. 1865-1874.  aPURPOSE: To study, in high-fructose-fed rats, the effect of a dietary enrichment in omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFA) on the expression of genes involved in lipid metabolism and cardiovascular function. METHODS: Twenty-eight male “Wistar Han” rats received for 8 weeks, either a standard chow food or an isocaloric 67 % fructose diet enriched or not in alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) or in docosahexaenoic (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acids (EPA) mix (DHA/EPA). After sacrifice, blood was withdrawn for biochemical analyses; heart, periepididymal adipose tissue and liver were collected and analyzed for the expression of 22 genes by real-time PCR. RESULTS: Fructose intake resulted in an increase in liver weight and triglyceride content, plasma triglyceride and cholesterol concentrations, although no difference in glucose and insulin. In the liver, lipogenesis was promoted as illustrated by an increase in stearoyl-CoA desaturase and fatty acid synthase (Fasn) together with a decrease in PPAR gamma, delta and PPAR gamma coactivator 1 alpha (PGC1 alpha) expression. In the heart, Fasn and PPAR delta expression were increased. The addition of ALA or DHA/EPA into the diet resulted in a protection against fructose effects except for the decreased expression of PPARs in the liver that was not counterbalanced by n-3 PUFA suggesting that n-3 PUFA and fructose act independently on the expression of PPARs and PGC1 alpha. CONCLUSIONS: In liver, but not in heart, the fructose-enriched diet induces an early tissue-specific reduction in PPAR gamma and delta expression, which is insensitive to n-3 PUFA intake and dissociated from lipogenesis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadipose tissue 3aalpha-linolenic acid 3ablood 3acholesterol 3adiet 3adocosahexaenoic acid 3aeicosapentaenoic acid 3afatty-acid synthase 3afructose 3agenes 3aglucose 3aheart 3ainsulin 3alipogenesis 3aliver 3aomega-3 fatty acids 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3arats 3astearoyl-CoA desaturase 3atriacylglycerols 2aAdipose Tissuexdrug effectsxmetabolism. 2aAnimals 2aBlood Glucosexmetabolism 2aCholesterolxblood 2aDiet 2aFatty Acid Synthasesxmetabolism 2aFatty Acids, Omega-3xpharmacology 2aFructosexadministration & dosagexadverse effects. 2aGene Expression Regulation 2aInsulinxblood 2aLipid Metabolismxdrug effects 2aLiverxdrug effectsxmetabolism. 2aMale 2aMembrane Transport Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aOrgan Sizexdrug effects 2aPPAR deltaxmetabolism 2aRats 2aRats, Wistar 2aReal-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction 2aReceptors, LDLxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aStearoyl-CoA Desaturasexmetabolism 2aTranscription Factorsxmetabolism 2aTriglyceridesxblood1 aLandrier, Jean-François1 aRousseau-Ralliard, Delphine1 aRobbez-Masson, Vanessa1 aMargotat, Alain1 aDeprez, Paule1 aLechêne, Paulette1 aGrynberg, Alain1 aLairon, Denis1 aPlanells, Richard1 aGastaldi, Marguerite0 tEuropean journal of nutrition.g2013 Dec., v. 52, no. 8 p.1865-1874dSpringer-Verlagx1436-62077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00394-012-0488-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02320naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005100150245010600201300001800307520101000325592002801335650002501363650001901388650001501407700001801422700005601440700005501496700001501551700005401566700005201620700005301672700002301725773012801748856008501876852000901961655001201970IND60763247120221120125241.0220118e20220106xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076324712DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.analchem.1c040152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHao, Qi1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5525-441710aVerification and Analysis of Single-Molecule SERS Events via Polarization-Selective Raman Measurement  ap. 1046-1051.  aWe propose polarization-selective Raman measurement as a decent method for single-molecule surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SMSERS) verification. This approach features rapid acquisition of SMSERS events and appeals liberal requirements for analyte concentration. It is demonstrated as an efficient tool in sorting out dozens of SMSERS events from a large-scale plasmonic dimer array. In addition, it allows identification of a mixed SMSERS event containing two different individual molecules. In this article, the RPM method is employed to explore the underlying mechanisms of signal blinking, spectral wandering, and other unique characteristics in SMSERS. We observed synchronized blinking of different modes from one Rhodamine 6G (R6G) molecule, but a disagreement is found in a mixed SMSERS event containing one R6G molecule and one crystal violet molecule. Our approach offers a reliable means to interpret SMSERS events in statistical terms and facilitate the fundamental understanding of SMSERS.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanalytical chemistry 3agentian violet 3arhodamines1 aPeng, Zhaohui1 aWang, Jiawei1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6323-80811 aFan, Xingce1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2508-30631 aLi, Guoqun1 aZhao, Xing1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8817-94841 aMa, Libo1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9850-22921 aQiu, Teng1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1160-26191 aSchmidt, Oliver G.0 tAnalytical chemistry.g2022 Jan. 06, v. 94, no. 2 p.1046-1051dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:jnl70375x1520-68827nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.analchem.1c040153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02390naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001300151245012900164520113900293592002801432650001901460650001501479650001301494650001101507650001401518650001001532650000701542650001501549650001701564653002101581653001801602653002701620653002401647653002101671700001801692700001301710700001401723700002101737773011501758856008601873852000901959655001201968IND60778769220221118180747.0220726e20220905xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077876922DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhazmat.2022.1292352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Ping10aHighly porous α-MnO2 nanorods with enhanced defect accessibility for efficient catalytic ozonation of refractory pollutants  aHerein we reported the first example of preparing α-MnO₂ by selective acid etching from Mn-containing spinel. The defects, facet, and surface area of α-MnO₂ were cooperatively engineered by an all-in-one acid etching method to enhance the defect accessibility to the reactants. The obtained highly porous α-MnO₂ nanorods have rich defects of Mn³⁺ (24.9%) and oxygen vacancies (31.4%), mainly active crystal facets of (110), and an ultrahigh surface area of 271.1 m²/g. With α-MnO₂ nanorods as the catalysts, more than 90.9% of 4-chlorophenol can be degraded within 12 min by catalytic ozonation in a wide work pH of 4.5–10.5. The experiments and DFT theory calculations reveal that α-MnO₂ with (110) facet promotes the adsorption and activation of ozone directly over the defects or indirectly over H₂O adsorbed on the defects. Thus, more reactive oxygen species (e.g., •OH, •O₂⁻, ¹O₂, surface *O) are generated and get involved in pollutant degradation. This work provides a facile method to maximize the defect accessibility, and a deeper mechanistic study to understand the roles of the defects.  aPublisher supplied data 3a4-chlorophenol 3aadsorption 3ananorods 3aoxygen 3aozonation 3aozone 3apH 3apollutants 3asurface area 0aα-MnO2 nanorods 0aCrystal facet 0aUltrahigh surface area 0aCatalytic ozonation 0aDFT calculations1 aZhan, Shujuan1 aYao, Lan1 aXiong, Ya1 aTian, Shuanghong0 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2022 Sept. 05, v. 437 p.129235-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6200x0304-38947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2022.1292353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03322naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002100146245011900167300001800286520167900304650002001983650002502003650002802028650002102056650002402077650002602101650002002127650002802147650002002175650002102195650003002216650002602246650001602272650001302288650001302301650000902314650001002323650001502333650001602348650000902364650001902373650001102392650000902403650001702412650001902429650001202448650002702460650001302487650001202500650002602512773016202538856004702700852000902747655001202756IND60517591520221119104840.0160401e20150422xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051759152DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jafc.5b007782doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFriedman, Mendel10aAntibiotic-Resistant Bacteria: Prevalence in Food and Inactivation by Food-Compatible Compounds and Plant Extracts  ap. 3805-3822.  aFoodborne antibiotic-resistant pathogenic bacteria such as Campylobacter jejuni, Bacillus cereus, Clostridium perfringens, Escherichia coli, Salmonella enterica, Staphylococcus aureus, Vibrio cholerae, and Vibrio parahemolyticus can adversely affect animal and human health, but a better understanding of the factors involved in their pathogenesis is needed. To help meet this need, this overview surveys and interprets much of our current knowledge of antibiotic (multidrug)-resistant bacteria in the food chain and the implications for microbial food safety and animal and human health. Topics covered include the origin and prevalence of resistant bacteria in the food chain (dairy, meat, poultry, seafood, and herbal products, produce, and eggs), their inactivation by different classes of compounds and plant extracts and by the use of chlorine and physicochemical methods (heat, UV light, pulsed electric fields, and high pressure), the synergistic antimicrobial effects of combinations of natural antimicrobials with medicinal antibiotics, and mechanisms of antimicrobial activities and resistant effects. Possible areas for future research are suggested. Plant-derived and other safe natural antimicrobial compounds have the potential to control the prevalence of both susceptible and resistant pathogens in various environments. The collated information and suggested research will hopefully contribute to a better understanding of approaches that could be used to minimize the presence of resistant pathogens in animal feed and human food, thus reducing adverse effects, improving microbial food safety, and helping to prevent or treat animal and human infections. 3aBacillus cereus 3aCampylobacter jejuni 3aClostridium perfringens 3aEscherichia coli 3aSalmonella enterica 3aStaphylococcus aureus 3aVibrio cholerae 3aVibrio parahaemolyticus 3aadverse effects 3aanimal pathogens 3aanti-infective properties 3aantibiotic resistance 3aantibiotics 3abacteria 3achlorine 3aeggs 3afeeds 3afood chain 3afood safety 3aheat 3ahuman diseases 3ahumans 3ameat 3apathogenesis 3aplant extracts 3apoultry 3apulsed electric fields 3aseafoods 3asurveys 3aultraviolet radiation0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2015 Apr. 22, v. 63, no. 15 p.3805-3822dAmerican Chemical Society, Books and Journals Divisionx0021-85617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jafc.5b00778  aDNAL 7aarticle03371naa a2200649 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245016900167520156400336592002801900650002101928650002301949650001701972650001001989650001801999650001902017650001902036650000902055650001302064650001102077650002102088650002402109650002602133650000902159650001902168650002902187650004402216653001202260653001802272653001302290653002102303653001202324653000902336653000802345653000902353653000802362653000802370653000802378653001102386653000902397653001502406653000702421653000802428653000702436700001502443700001302458700001502471700001602486773011202502856008602614852000902700655001202709IND60653826820221117080622.0190718e20190901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065382682DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jchromb.2019.1217162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShi, Meiyun10aDevelopment of an UPLC-MS/MS method coupled with in-source CID for quantitative analysis of PEG-PLA copolymer and its application to a pharmacokinetic study in rats  aPoly(ethylene glycol)-block-poly(lactic acid) (PEG-PLA) is a biocompatible and amphiphilic block copolymer composed of a hydrophilic PEG block and a hydrophobic PLA block, which can self-assemble into micelles in water. It is one of the most commonly used biodegradable polymers for drug encapsulation, drug solubilization and drug delivery. Due to the complexity and heterogeneity of PEG-PLA, the precise analysis of this polymer is a great challenge. This study reports an application of an UPLC tandem mass spectrometry coupled with in-source collision induced dissociation (CID) technique for the analysis of a model compound mPEG2000-PDLLA2500-COOH, which could be dissociated in source and generate a series of fragment ions corresponding to its subunits. These surrogate ions including PLA-specific and PEG-specific fragment ions could be further broken into specific product ions in collision cell. Finally, the ion transition at m/z 505.0 → 217.0 was selected for the quantitation of mPEG2000-PDLLA2500-COOH. This assay achieved a lower limit of quantitation (LLOQ) of 0.05 μg/mL with only 30 μL rat plasma. The linear range is 0.05 to 5 μg/mL. Intraday and interday accuracy and precision were within ±12.1%. The method was successfully applied to the pharmacokinetic study of mPEG2000-PDLLA2500-COOH in rats. The results revealed that LC-MS/MS coupled with in-source CID is a sensitive and specific strategy for analysis of PEG-PLA. This method can be potentially extended to the analysis of other pharmaceutical polymer excipients.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiodegradability 3acomposite polymers 3adissociation 3adrugs 3aencapsulation 3ahydrophilicity 3ahydrophobicity 3aions 3amicelles 3amodels 3apharmacokinetics 3apolyethylene glycol 3aquantitative analysis 3arats 3asolubilization 3atandem mass spectrometry 3aultra-performance liquid chromatography 0aPEG-PLA 0aIn-source CID 0aLC-MS/MS 0aPharmacokinetics 0aPEG-PLA 0amPPC 0aCID 0aLLOQ 0aPPT 0aLLE 0aSPE 0aAUC0-t 0at1/2 0aHPLC-MS/MS 0aIS 0aESI 0aQC1 aJiang, Hui1 aYin, Lei1 aLiu, Yajun1 aXu, Mengyao0 tJournal of chromatography.g2019 Sept. 01, v. 1125 p.121716-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12459x1570-02327nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jchromb.2019.1217163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02330naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001600146245011200162300001800274500001900292520094500311592002801256650001201284650001301296650001801309650001201327650001301339650001401352650002301366700005401389700001701443700001601460700001601476700001201492700001401504700005401518700005701572700005401629773013601683856008001819852000901899655001201908IND60733000420221118034424.0210402e20210322xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073300042DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.1c012302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYan, Hanxue10aLithium Palladium Hydride Promotes Chemical Looping Ammonia Synthesis Mediated by Lithium Imide and Hydride  ap. 6716-6722.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aPalladium (Pd) has long been known to be inactive for dinitrogen activation and hence has received little attention for ammonia synthesis. Herein, we report that the reactivity of Pd is changed when reacting with lithium hydride (LiH) forming a series of lithium palladium hydrides such as LiPdH₀.₇ and Li₂PdH₂ (denoted as [Li–Pd–H]). LiPdH₀.₇ promotes N₂ fixation by LiH forming Li₂NH and LiPd, and the subsequent hydrogenation of Li₂NH and LiPd leads to ammonia and regeneration of LiH and [Li–Pd–H]. Based on these experimental results, an ammonia loop mediated by a [Li–Pd–H]–LiH and LiPd–Li₂NH composite pair is proposed and demonstrated. An ammonia production rate of 693 μmolNH₃ g–¹ h–¹ was achieved at 300 °C and 1 bar, which is ca. 7 times that of the neat LiH/Li₂NH pair at 350 °C and 1 bar and 2 times that of the thermocatalytic process catalyzed by Ru/MgO at 300 °C and 10 bar.  aPublisher supplied data 3aammonia 3ahydrides 3ahydrogenation 3alithium 3anitrogen 3apalladium 3aphysical chemistry1 aGao, Wenbo1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4471-18701 aWang, Qianru1 aGuan, Yeqin1 aFeng, Sheng1 aWu, Han1 aGuo, Qing1 aCao, Hujun1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5464-66491 aGuo, Jianping1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0229-85551 aChen, Ping1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0625-06390 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2021 Mar. 22, v. 125, no. 12 p.6716-6722dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23573x1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.1c012303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02380naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002700150245008200177300001800259520122100277592002801498650001601526650002501542650001501567650001301582650001901595650001101614650001301625650001701638650001701655650001401672650001301686700002301699700006201722773012801784856008501912852000901997655001202006IND60763247220221120125145.0220118e20211221xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076324722DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.analchem.1c040382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTremblay, Catherine Y.10aEpitope Mapping with Diethylpyrocarbonate Covalent Labeling-Mass Spectrometry  ap. 1052-1059.  aAntigen–antibody epitope mapping is essential for understanding binding mechanisms and developing new protein therapeutics. In this study, we investigate diethylpyrocarbonate (DEPC) covalent labeling-mass spectrometry as a means of analyzing antigen–antibody interactions using the well-characterized model system of TNFα in complex with three different antibodies. Results show that residues buried in the epitope undergo substantial decreases in labeling, as expected. Interestingly, serine, threonine, and tyrosine residues at the edges of the epitope undergo unexpected increases in labeling. The increased labeling of these weakly nucleophilic residues is caused by the formation of hydrophobic pockets upon antibody binding that presumably increase local DEPC concentrations. Residues that are distant from the epitope generally do not undergo changes in labeling extent; however, some that do change experience variations in their local microenvironment due to side-chain reorganization or stabilization of the TNFα trimer that occurs upon binding. Overall, DEPC labeling of antigen–antibody complexes is found to depend on both changes in solvent exposure and changes to the residue microenvironment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLewis bases 3aanalytical chemistry 3aantibodies 3aepitopes 3ahydrophobicity 3aserine 3asolvents 3aspectroscopy 3atherapeutics 3athreonine 3atyrosine1 aKirsch, Zachary J.1 aVachet, Richard W.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4514-02100 tAnalytical chemistry.g2021 Dec. 21, v. 94, no. 2 p.1052-1059dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:jnl70375x1520-68827nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.analchem.1c040383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04385naa a2200685 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002200094024001900116024003500135040001800170100001900188245011300207300001200320506007600332520224600408592002802654596006702682506003702749650002402786650002102810650001802831650001402849650001502863650002302878650001602901650001402917650002002931650001802951650003802969650002103007650001903028650003103047650002603078650001103104650001703115650002103132650001803153650001703171650003703188650000903225650002203234650002503256650001403281650003203295650001303327700002003340700001903360700001803379700001803397700002103415700001603436700001903452700001703471773010803488856008203596852000903678655001203687IND60572289320221207053529.0220818e201712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057228932DNAL7 aPMC53334302pmcid7 a282495992pmid7 a10.1186/s13071-017-2026-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChung, Eun Joo10aHeat shock proteins 70 and 90 from Clonorchis sinensis induce Th1 response and stimulate antibody production  ap. 118.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Heat shock proteins (HSPs) are found in all prokaryotes and most compartments of eukaryotic cells. Members of the HSP family mediate immune responses to tissue damage or cellular stress. However, little is known about the immune response induced by the oriental liver fluke, Clonorchis sinensis, even though this organism is carcinogenic to humans. We address this issue in the present study in mouse bone marrow dendritic cells (mBMDCs), using recombinant HSP70 and 90 from C. sinensis (rCsHSP70 and rCsHSP90). METHODS: rCsHSP70 and rCsHSP90 were produced in an E. coli system. Purified recombinant proteins were treated in BMDCs isolated from C57BL/6 mice. T cells were isolated from Balb/c mice and co-cultured with activated mBMDCs. Expression of surface molecules was measured by flow cytometry and cytokine secretion was quantified using ELISA. C57BL/6 mice were divided into four groups, including peptide alone, peptide/Freund’s adjuvant, peptide/CsHSP70, peptide/CsHSP90, and were immunized intraperitoneally three times. Two weeks after final immunization, antibodies against peptide were measured using ELISA. RESULTS: Both proteins induced a dose-dependent upregulation in major histocompatibility complex and co-stimulatory molecule expression and increased secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines including interleukin (IL)-1β, -6, and -12p70 and tumor necrosis factor-α in mBMDCs. Furthermore, when allogenic T cells were incubated with mBMDCs activated by rCsHSP70 and rCsHSP90, the helper T cell (Th)1 cytokine interferon-γ was up-regulated whereas the level of the Th2 cytokine IL-4 was unchanged. These results indicate that rCsHSPs predominantly induce a Th1 response. Over and above these results, we also demonstrated that the production of peptide-specific antibodies can be activated after immunization via in vitro peptide binding with rCsHSP70 or rCsHSP90. CONCLUSION: This study showed for the first time that the HSP or HSP/peptide complexes of C. sinensis could be considered as a more effective vaccine against C. sinensis infection as results of the activator of host immune response as well as the adjuvant for antigenic peptide conjugate to induce peptide-specific antibody response in mice.  aPublisher supplied data  a2012-N54002-00cKorea Centers for Disease Control & Prevention0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aClonorchis sinensis 3aEscherichia coli 3aT-lymphocytes 3aadjuvants 3aantibodies 3aantibody formation 3abone marrow 3acoculture 3adendritic cells 3adose response 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3aeukaryotic cells 3aflow cytometry 3agene expression regulation 3aheat-shock protein 70 3ahumans 3aimmunization 3ainterferon-gamma 3ainterleukin-4 3aliver flukes 3amajor histocompatibility complex 3amice 3aprokaryotic cells 3arecombinant proteins 3asecretion 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha 3avaccines1 aJeong, Young-Il1 aLee, Myoung-Ro1 aKim, Yu-jung,1 aLee, Sang-Eun1 aCho, Shin-Hyeong1 aLee, Won-Ja1 aPark, Mi-Yeoun1 aJu, Jung-Won0 tParasites & vectors.g2017 Dec., v. 10, no. 1 p.118-118dBioMed CentralwJournal:24143x1756-33057nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13071-017-2026-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02603naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100003000151245013300181300001600314520148800330592002801818650001401846650002501860650001101885650001201896653003701908653001501945653002501960653003101985700002202016700001902038773011302057856008602170852000902256655001202265IND60628630220221120113523.0190325e20190410xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062863022DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2019.01.1242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOwusu, Emmanuel Kingsford10aToward a cleaner project procurement: Evaluation of construction projects’ vulnerability to corruption in developing countries  ap. 394-407.  aWhile the measurement and predictability of corruption are reported to be difficult due to its clandestine nature, this paper attempts to develop a measurement model for evaluating the proneness of the procurement process of construction projects to corruption. The model is developed using a soft computing approach (i.e. the Fuzzy Synthetic Evaluation technique) to assess the levels of vulnerability with respect to the stages of corruption and their corresponding activities within the procurement process of construction projects. A review of related literature produced a 21-activity list encapsulated within the four stages of the procurement process. The list was evaluated by procurement and construction practitioners through an expert survey. The analysis of the survey results revealed an overall project vulnerability index which suggests that construction projects executed in developing countries are relatively susceptible to corrupt practices. The main stages of the process that were identified to be vulnerable were the contract stage (CTS) and the post-contract phase (PCP). The developed model is, possibly, the first measuring tool that evaluates and predicts a project’s susceptibility to corruption and provides useful insights that can inform project parties, policymakers and anti-corruption activists in their efforts to implement necessary actions aimed at curbing the incidence of corrupt practices in construction projects in the developing countries.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactivists 3adeveloping countries 3amodels 3asurveys 0aConstruction project procurement 0aCorruption 0aDeveloping countries 0aFuzzy synthetic evaluation1 aChan, Albert P.C.1 aAmeyaw, Ernest0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2019 Apr. 10, v. 216 p.394-407dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2019.01.1243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02990naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002200155245007300177300001600250520138600266592002801652650001801680650001201698650002001710650001901730650002001749650001401769650001901783650001701802650001801819650001401837650002401851650002101875650001901896650002501915650001401940650002101954653001901975653001801994653002502012653001902037653001302056653002002069700001802089700002502107700002202132700002402154700002102178700001802199700003202217773007702249856008902326852000902415655001202424IND60545310920221119224021.0160901e201408  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054531092DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2014.01.0572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMinguez, Laetitia10aAcute toxicity of 8 antidepressants: What are their modes of action?  ap. 314-319.  aCurrently, the hazard posed by pharmaceutical residues is a major concern of ecotoxicology. Most of the antidepressants belong to a family named the Cationic Amphipathic Drugs known to have specific interactions with cell membranes. The present study assessed the impact of eight antidepressants belonging to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors or serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors by the combination of multi-approaches (in vivo, in vitro, in silico) and gives some insights on the mode of action for these molecules. Antidepressants were from the most to the least toxic compound for Daphnia magna: Sertraline (EC50=1.15mgL−1)>Clomipramine (2.74mgL−1)>Amitriptyline (4.82mgL−1)>Fluoxetine (5.91mgL−1)>Paroxetine (6.24mgL−1)>Mianserine (7.81mgL−1)>Citalopram (30.14mgL−1) and Venlafaxine (141.28mgL−1). These acute toxicities were found correlated to Log Kow coefficients (R=0.93, p<0.001) and to cytotoxicity assessed on abalone hemocytes through the neutral red uptake assay (R=0.96, p<0.001). If narcosis as mode of action is typically expected during acute ecotoxicity bioassays, we showed by molecular modeling that particular interactions can exist between antidepressants and phosphatidylcholine, a major component of cell membranes, leading to a more specific mode of action corresponding to a potential acidic hydrolysis of ester functions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDaphnia magna 3aabalone 3aacid hydrolysis 3aacute toxicity 3aantidepressants 3abioassays 3acell membranes 3acytotoxicity 3aecotoxicology 3ahemocytes 3amechanism of action 3amolecular models 3anorepinephrine 3aphosphatidylcholines 3aserotonin 3atoxic substances 0aPharmaceutical 0aDaphnia magna 0aHaliotis tuberculata 0aMulti-approach 0aNarcosis 0aLysosomotropism1 aFarcy, Emilie1 aBallandonne, Céline1 aLepailleur, Alban1 aSerpentini, Antoine1 aLebel, Jean-Marc1 aBureau, Ronan1 aHalm-Lemeille, Marie-Pierre0 tChemosphere.g2014 Aug., v. 108 p.314-319dElsevier Ltdx0045-65357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2014.01.0573Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02806naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001600146245009800162300001800260500001900278520157700297592002801874650001501902650001401917650001101931650001401942650001301956650001201969650001401981650002301995700001902018700001402037700001702051700001602068700001602084700005502100700001602155773013602171856008002307852000902387655001202396IND60733000520221118034358.0210402e20210318xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073300052DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.1c013982doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aUzma, Faiza10aUnderstanding the Sub-meV Precision-Tuning of Magnetic Anisotropy of Single-Molecule Junction  ap. 6990-6997.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aFine-tuning the magnetic anisotropy energy (MAE) of a magnetic molecule with a high precision of sub-meV has been realized experimentally by manipulating the tip of a scanning tunneling microscope (STM). Understanding the mechanisms behind the observed evolution of spin excitation energy is essentially important for potential spintronic applications. In particular, it is crucial to unveil the influence of the surrounding environment on the molecular spin state. To this end, we carry out the first-principles simulation on the STM-tip control of an iron octaethylporphyrin chloride (Fe-OEP-Cl) molecule adsorbed on the Pb(111) substrate. By carefully taking into account the atomic structures of the tip and the substrate as well as the multireference feature of the Fe 3d electrons, the experimentally measured evolution of spin excitation energy, including a continuous increase, followed by a sudden drop in the MAE, is accurately reproduced by our simulation with a maximal discrepancy of less than 0.3 meV. Based on a comprehensive analysis of the change in geometric and electronic structures of the whole single-molecule junction, the exotic evolution of MAE is attributed to the variation of the ligand confinement effect and the resulting charge transfer. The unique role of the single-atomic Cl ligand is clarified by comparing the evolution under the STM-tip control with that of the tip/Fe-OEP/Pb(111) junction. The theoretical insights provided by this work would be valuable for the on-demand design of the mechanically controlled magnetic nanojunctions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanisotropy 3achlorides 3aenergy 3aevolution 3ageometry 3aligands 3amagnetism 3aphysical chemistry1 aYang, Longqing1 aHe, Dawei1 aWang, Xiaoli1 aHu, Shaojin1 aYe, Lyuzhou1 aZheng, Xiao1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9804-18331 aYan, YiJing0 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2021 Mar. 18, v. 125, no. 12 p.6990-6997dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23573x1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.1c013983Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03026naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002600147245012100173300001400294520147500308592002801783650002401811650002701835650002201862650001201884650001701896650001701913650001301930650001201943650001501955650001301970650002301983650001402006650001102020650001402031650001102045653001602056653001102072653001902083653003602102653001402138653001202152700001802164700001902182700002002201700002002221700002102241700002202262773011002284856008102394852000902475655001202484IND60634830720221122042757.0190326e201803  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063483072DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fgb.2016.07.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrandenburger, Eileen10aMulti-genome analysis identifies functional and phylogenetic diversity of basidiomycete adenylate-forming reductases  ap. 55-63.  aAmong the invaluable benefits of basidiomycete genomics is the dramatically enhanced insight into the potential capacity to biosynthesize natural products. This study focuses on adenylate-forming reductases, which is a group of natural product biosynthesis enzymes that resembles non-ribosomal peptide synthetases, yet serves to modify one substrate, rather than to condense two or more building blocks. Phylogenetically, these reductases fall in four classes. The phylogeny of Heterobasidion annosum (Russulales) and Serpula lacrymans (Boletales) adenylate-forming reductases was investigated. We identified a previously unrecognized phylogenetic branch within class III adenylate-forming reductases. Three representatives were heterologously produced and their substrate preferences determined in vitro: NPS9 and NPS11 of S. lacrymans preferred l-threonine and benzoic acid, respectively, while NPS10 of H. annosum accepted phenylpyruvic acid best. We also investigated two class IV adenylate-forming reductases of Coprinopsis cinerea, which each were active with l-alanine, l-valine, and l-serine as substrates. Our results show that adenylate-forming reductases are functionally more diverse than previously recognized. As none of the natural products known from the species investigated in this study includes the identified substrates of their respective reductases, our findings may help further explore the diversity of these basidiomycete secondary metabolomes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCoprinopsis cinerea 3aHeterobasidion annosum 3aSerpula lacrymans 3aalanine 3abenzoic acid 3abiosynthesis 3agenomics 3aligases 3ametabolome 3apeptides 3aphenylpyruvic acid 3aphylogeny 3aserine 3athreonine 3avaline 0aCoprinopsis 0aGenome 0aHeterobasidion 0aNonribosomal peptide synthetase 0aReductase 0aSerpula1 aBraga, Daniel1 aKombrink, Anja1 aLackner, Gerald1 aGressler, Julia1 aKünzler, Markus1 aHoffmeister, Dirk0 tFungal genetics and biology.g2018 Mar., v. 112 p.55-63dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl54870x1087-18457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fgb.2016.07.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03909naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002700151245011200178300001800290520220200308592002802510650002402538650001402562650001102576650001502587650002702602650001102629650002102640650001702661650002002678650003202698650001302730650001602743650001202759650002302771650001902794650002602813650002502839650001402864650001702878653002002895653002002915653002602935653002302961700003202984700002703016700004403043700003603087700002203123773011503145856008603260852000903346655001203355IND60628630320221120113609.0190319e20190401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062863032DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2019.01.1252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchwingel, Alice Watte10aLaying hen manure in anaerobic Co-Digestion with glycerin containing different glycerol and impurity levels  ap. 1437-1444.  aBiodiesel has arisen as a promising option of renewable fuel to minimize the impacts caused by fossil fuels. However, its production process generates high amounts of crude glycerin as a residue, which is considered low-quality commercially due to its low glycerol content. In order to add value to this byproduct, some production plants employ a purification process. Nonetheless, aiming to cut down costs with this purification step, many researches have been seeking treatments that use glycerin with lower purity, such as anaerobic co-digestion with another residue of complementary composition so as to balance the digestion medium and increase energy yield. During recycling, glycerin goes from an environmental liability to a sustainable financial asset by being transformed into cleaner energy, i.e., biogas. This research was carried out to assess the influence of glycerol content in glycerin containing the same impurities at three proportions (40% (G40), 60% (G60), and 80% (G80)), and to add them to the process at different glycerol levels (0, 1, 2, 3, and 4%) in the total solids (TS) of the affluents prepared with laying hen manure. No interaction was found between glycerin type and glycerol content regarding biogas and methane productions as well as reductions in TS and volatile solids (VS). Adding 2.5% glycerol led to the highest specific biogas production (1654.1 L kg−1 VS added) while adding 2.6% yielded the maximum specific production of methane (1058.9 L kg−1 VS added), i.e., glycerol increased methane generation by over 36% when compared with the treatment with no glycerin. Consequently, greater reductions in TS (60.97%) and VS (73.6%) were observed with ideal addition levels of 2.2 and 2.4% glycerol. Adding 2.1% glycerol using G40 resulted in the greatest reduction (55.4%) in chemical oxygen demand (COD) whereas such reduction was by 50.4 and 50.5% for G60 and G80 when 2.6% glycerol were added. With that in mind, and in face of the high costs of purification, G40 can be recommended with addition of 2.6% glycerol to TS to improve co-digestion with laying hen manure and generate energy that returns to poultry and biodiesel production systems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanaerobic digestion 3abiodiesel 3abiogas 3abyproducts 3achemical oxygen demand 3aenergy 3afinancial assets 3afossil fuels 3afuel production 3agas production (biological) 3aglycerol 3alaying hens 3amethane 3amethane production 3apoultry manure 3aproduction technology 3apurification methods 3arecycling 3atotal solids 0aBatch digestion 0aBiodiesel waste 0aGlycerin purity level 0aMethane production1 aOrrico, Ana Carolina Amorim1 ade Lucas Junior, Jorge1 aOrrico Junior, Marco Antonio Previdelli1 aAspilcueta Borquis, Rusbel Raul1 aFava, Aldo Felipe0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2019 Apr. 01, v. 215 p.1437-1444dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2019.01.1253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03637naa a2200721 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003600113040001800149100002100167245012100188300001400309520112100323592002801444650001501472650001801487650001001505650003101515650001001546650002201556650001301578650001801591650001501609650001301624650003901637650003501676650003901711650004801750650001201798650008001810650004301890650003001933650004501963650003402008650003502042650002302077650001102100650002002111650002002131650005602151650000902207650005102216650005902267650005902326650004402385650003602429650004802465650004002513700002202553700003202575700002202607700002702629700001702656700001902673700002202692700001802714773008002732856008202812852000902894655001202903IND60098986320221119202254.0141105e20120910xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009898632DNAL7 a227595132pmid7 a10.1016/j.gene.2012.06.0532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHasmats, Johanna10aIdentification of candidate SNPs for drug induced toxicity from differentially expressed genes in associated tissues  ap. 62-68.  aThe growing collection of publicly available high-throughput data provides an invaluable resource for generating preliminary in silico data in support of novel hypotheses. In this study we used a cross-dataset meta-analysis strategy to identify novel candidate genes and genetic variations relevant to paclitaxel/carboplatin-induced myelosuppression and neuropathy. We identified genes affected by drug exposure and present in tissues associated with toxicity. From ten top-ranked genes 42 non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were identified in silico and genotyped in 94 cancer patients treated with carboplatin/paclitaxel. We observed variations in 11 SNPs, of which seven were present in a sufficient frequency for statistical evaluation. Of these seven SNPs, three were present in ABCA1 and ATM, and showed significant or borderline significant association with either myelosuppression or neuropathy. The strikingly high number of associations between genotype and clinically observed toxicity provides support for our data-driven computations strategy to identify biomarkers for drug toxicity.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiomarkers 3adrug toxicity 3adrugs 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3agenetic variation 3agenotype 3ameta-analysis 3apaclitaxel 3apatients 3aperipheral nervous system diseases 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 2aATP Binding Cassette Transporter 1 2aATP-Binding Cassette Transportersxgenetics 2aAnimals 2aAntineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocolsxpharmacokineticsxtoxicity. 2aAtaxia Telangiectasia Mutated Proteins 2aBone Marrowxdrug effects 2aCarboplatinxpharmacokineticsxtoxicity. 2aCell Cycle Proteinsxgenetics 2aDNA-Binding Proteinsxgenetics 2aDatabases, Genetic 2aFemale 2aGene Expression 2aGenetic Markers 2aLung Neoplasmsxdrug therapyxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aMale 2aNeoplasmsxdrug therapyxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aNervous System Diseasesxchemically inducedxgenetics. 2aOvarian Neoplasmsxdrug therapyxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aPaclitaxelxpharmacokineticsxtoxicity. 2aPolymorphism, Single Nucleotide 2aProtein Serine-Threonine Kinasesxgenetics. 2aTumor Suppressor Proteinsxgenetics1 aKupershmidt, Ilya1 aRodríguez-Antona, Cristina1 aSu, Qiaojuan Jane1 aKhan, Muhammad Suleman1 aJara, Carlos1 aMielgo, Xabier1 aLundeberg, Joakim1 aGreen, Henrik0 tGene.g2012 Sept. 10, v. 506, no. 1 p.62-68dElsevier B.V.x0378-11197nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gene.2012.06.0533Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03856naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002200094024001900116024003500135040001800170100002000188245008800208300001200296506007600308520211400384592002802498506003702526650002102563650002602584650002202610650002902632650001402661650002102675650002102696650001002717650002002727650001002747650001802757650000902775650001102784650001402795650001402809650001402823650002102837650001302858650001202871700002002883700001802903700002102921700001902942700001602961700002202977700001502999700002003014700002103034773010803055856008203163852000903245655001203254IND60572289520221207053514.0220818e201712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057228952DNAL7 aPMC53334272pmcid7 a282495912pmid7 a10.1186/s13071-017-2018-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGolenser, Jacob10aControlled release of artemisone for the treatment of experimental cerebral malaria  ap. 117.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Cerebral malaria (CM) is a leading cause of malarial mortality resulting from infection by Plasmodium falciparum. Treatment commonly involves adjunctive care and injections or transfusion of artemisinins. All artemisinins that are in current use are metabolized to dihydroxyartemisinin (DHA), to which there is already some parasite resistance. We used artemisone, a derivative that does not convert to DHA, has improved pharmacokinetics and anti-plasmodial activity and is also anti-inflammatory (an advantage given the immunopathological nature of CM). METHODS: We examined controlled artemisone release from biodegradable polymers in a mouse CM model. This would improve treatment by exposing the parasites for a longer period to a non-toxic drug concentration, high enough to eliminate the pathogen and prevent CM. The preparations were inserted into mice as prophylaxis, early or late treatment in the disease course. RESULTS: The most efficient formulation was a rigid polymer, containing 80 mg/kg artemisone, which cured all of the mice when used as early treatment and 60% of the mice when used as a very late treatment (at which stage all control mice would die of CM within 24 h). In those mice that were not completely cured, relapse followed a latent period of more than seven days. Prophylactic treatment four days prior to the infection prevented CM. We also measured the amount of artemisone released from the rigid polymers using a bioassay with cultured P. falciparum. Significant amounts of artemisone were released throughout at least ten days, in line with the in vivo prophylactic results. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, we demonstrate, as a proof-of-concept, a controlled-sustained release system of artemisone for treatment of CM. Mice were cured or if treated at a very late stage of the disease, depicted a delay of a week before death. This delay would enable a considerable time window for exact diagnosis and appropriate additional treatment. Identical methods could be used for other parasites that are sensitive to artemisinins (e.g. Toxoplasma gondii and Neospora caninum).  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aNeospora caninum 3aPlasmodium falciparum 3aToxoplasma gondii 3aantiparasitic properties 3abioassays 3abiodegradability 3acerebral malaria 3adeath 3adisease control 3adrugs 3alatent period 3amice 3amodels 3amortality 3aparasites 3apathogens 3apharmacokinetics 3apolymers 3arelapse1 aBuchholz, Viola1 aBagheri, Amir1 aNasereddin, Abed1 aDzikowski, Ron1 aGuo, Jintao1 aHunt, Nicholas H.1 aEyal, Sara1 aVakruk, Natalia1 aGreiner, Andreas0 tParasites & vectors.g2017 Dec., v. 10, no. 1 p.117-117dBioMed CentralwJournal:24143x1756-33057nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13071-017-2018-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02436naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245007600168300001400244520106600258592002801324650001501352650001601367650001201383650001001395650002001405650002301425650001501448650002701463650002401490650001501514650001301529651001001542653001701552653002601569653002901595653002401624700003001648700001801678700002201696700002501718773014101743856008501884852000901969655001201978IND60653827220221117081322.0191108e201909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065382722DNAL7 a10.1016/j.mambio.2019.07.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPeris, Albert10aBaiting improves wild boar population size estimates by camera trapping  ap. 28-35.  aIn the last decade, camera trapping has become a widespread technique for wildlife monitoring. Although baits or attractants are commonly used to increase the likelihood of encounter, this practice has been criticised because of the potential biases in the population estimations based on these records obtained by mark-recapture or mark-resight methods, and especially in relative abundance indices (RAI). For two consecutive years, we evaluated the impact of baiting on wild boar (Sus scrofa) population estimates in a protected area of northeast Spain. In particular, we compared the number of boars per independent events (the group size), the estimated population size and RAI between periods with and without baiting. Baiting increased mean group size estimation and the likelihood of an encounter leading to more precise wild boar population estimates. The RAI values both at baited and unbaited campaigns correlated significantly with mark-resight abundance estimates, suggesting that these indices could be used to evaluate the boar population changes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSus scrofa 3aattractants 3abaiting 3aboars 3acamera trapping 3aconservation areas 3agroup size 3amark-recapture studies 3apopulation dynamics 3awild boars 3awildlife 3aSpain 0aMark-resight 0aPopulation estimation 0aRelative abundance index 0aWildlife monitoring1 aClosa-Sebastià, Francesc1 aMarco, Ignasi1 aSerrano, Emmanuel1 aCasas-Díaz, Encarna0 tMammalian biology.g2019 Sept., v. 98 p.28-35dElsevier GmbHaDeutsche Gesellschaft für SäugetierkundewJournal:12403x1616-50477nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.mambio.2019.07.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02999naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002500146245010700171300001800278520171100296650001302007650001302020650001602033650001402049650001102063650002102074650002302095650001102118650001002129650001902139650001002158650001102168650002302179650001102202650002102213650001702234700002102251700001902272700002302291700002102314773016202335856004702497852000902544655001202553IND60517591820221119104534.0160401e20150422xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051759182DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jafc.5b001482doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGenovese, Alessandro10aInfluence of Olive Oil Phenolic Compounds on Headspace Aroma Release by Interaction with Whey Proteins  ap. 3838-3850.  aThe release of volatile compounds in an oil-in-water model system obtained from olive oil–whey protein (WP) pairing was investigated by considering the effect of phenolic compounds. Human saliva was used to simulate mouth conditions by retronasal aroma simulator (RAS) analysis. Twelve aroma compounds were quantified in the dynamic headspace by SPME-GC/MS. The results showed significant influences of saliva on the aroma release of virgin olive oil (VOO) volatiles also in the presence of WP. The interaction between WP and saliva leads to lower headspace release of ethyl esters and hexanal. Salivary components caused lower decrease of the release of acetates and alcohols. A lower release of volatile compounds was found in the RAS essay in comparison to that in orthonasal simulation of only refined olive oil (without addition of saliva or WP), with the exception of hexanal and 1-penten-3-one, where a significantly higher release was found. Our results suggest that the extent of retronasal odor (green, pungent) of these two volatile compounds is higher than orthonasal odor. An extra VOO was used to verify the release in model systems, indicating that WP affected aroma release more than model systems, while saliva seems to exert an opposite trend. A significant increase in aroma release was found when phenolic compounds were added to the system, probably due to the contrasting effects of binding of volatile compounds caused by WP, for the polyphenol–protein interaction phenomenon. Our study could be applied to the formulation of new functional foods to enhance flavor release and modulate the presence and concentrations of phenolics and whey proteins in food emulsions/dispersions. 3aacetates 3aalcohols 3adispersions 3aemulsions 3aflavor 3afunctional foods 3aheadspace analysis 3ahumans 3amouth 3aodor compounds 3aodors 3aolives 3aphenolic compounds 3asaliva 3avirgin olive oil 3awhey protein1 aCaporaso, Nicola1 aLuca, Lucia de1 aPaduano, Antonello1 aSacchi, Raffaele0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2015 Apr. 22, v. 63, no. 15 p.3838-3850dAmerican Chemical Society, Books and Journals Divisionx0021-85617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jafc.5b00148  aDNAL 7aarticle02640naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245009500166520122500261592002801486650001901514650001601533650003101549650001701580650002501597650004001622650000901662650001601671650001101687650001401698650002501712650001801737650001501755653001001770653001601780653002501796653002701821653001601848700001501864700002001879700002001899700001901919700002001938773010601958856008502064852000902149655001202158IND60682313920221123005757.0200726e202005  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068231392DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envpol.2020.1139962doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Bei-Bei10aContamination profiles and health risks of PFASs in groundwater of the Maozhou River basin  aPer-and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) are a group of chemicals with a wide range of industrial and commercial applications, but little is known about the contamination of PFASs in groundwater and their linkage to surface water. Here we investigated the occurrence of PFASs in groundwater and surface water at the Maozhou River basin in order to understand their contamination profiles and potential health risks. The results showed that total PFASs concentrations ranged from 9.9 to 592.2 ng/L, 50.2–339.9 ng/L and 3.7–74.3 ng/g in groundwater, river water and sediment, respectively. The detection frequencies of C4–C8 chains (C₄–C₈) PFASs were higher than C9–C14 chains PFASs in the river and groundwater. Statistical analysis showed an obvious correlation between the major contaminants in the river and those in the groundwater, indicating the potential linkage of PFASs in the groundwater to the surface water. The wastewater indicator found in groundwater suggested domestic wastewater was only one of the source for the PFASs in the river and groundwater of Maozhou River basin. Moreover, human health risk assessment showed low risks from the PFASs to the residents by drinking groundwater.  aPublisher supplied data 3adrinking water 3agroundwater 3ahealth effects assessments 3ahuman health 3amunicipal wastewater 3aper- and polyfluoroalkyl substances 3arisk 3ariver water 3arivers 3asediments 3astatistical analysis 3asurface water 3awatersheds 0aPFASs 0aGroundwater 0aWastewater indicator 0aHealth risk assessment 0aRiver basin1 aHu, Li-Xin1 aYang, Yuan-Yuan1 aWang, Tuan-Tuan1 aLiu, Chongxuan1 aYing, Guang-Guo0 tEnvironmental pollution.g2020 May, v. 260 p.113996-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl41014x0269-74917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2020.1139963Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02427naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002100155245008000176300001600256520128100272592002801553650002901581650002601610650001401636650001001650650002001660650001401680650002001694653002601714653002001740653002401760653001301784700002001797700002401817700002501841773007701866856008901943852000902032655001202041IND60545311220221119224302.0160901e201408  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054531122DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2014.01.0602doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPakarinen, Kukka10aDistribution of fullerenes (nC60) between sediment and water in freshwaters  ap. 320-325.  aDepending on environmental conditions, fullerenes (nC60) have the potential to settle to the bottom sediments. In this study the distribution of nC60 was investigated in the labile zone between sediment and water. Three freshwater–sediment systems representing oligohumic, mesohumic, and polyhumic lakes with varying sediment composition and structure were used to investigate the target of fullerenes. The largest portion of water suspended fullerenes was found in the sediment, but a part re-suspended relatively quickly to water-stabile particles associated with natural particles. Rapid initial re-suspending was followed by a slower one offering a continuous pathway to the water phase. Re-suspending was highest from the sediment with a high amount of amorphous matter, small particles and a highly aliphatic character, amounting to 9±1% of the initial amount of fullerenes, whereas it was 4±1% in aromatic sediments with larger particles and less amorphous matter. These results indicate that bottom sediments can retain fullerenes but a portion may remain mobile depending on sediment character. Re-suspended fullerenes may again be available to aquatic species—this knowledge should thus be taken into account in the environmental risk assessment of fullerenes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenvironmental assessment 3aenvironmental factors 3afullerene 3alakes 3arisk assessment 3asediments 3awater pollution 0aAquatic ecotoxicology 0aBenthic species 0aCarbon nanoparticle 0aSorption1 aAkkanen, Jarkko1 aLeppänen, Matti T.1 aKukkonen, Jussi V.K.0 tChemosphere.g2014 Aug., v. 108 p.320-325dElsevier Ltdx0045-65357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2014.01.0603Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03170naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005800148245010900206520159100315592002801906650002501934650001401959650001101973650001501984650001201999650002502011650001502036650001602051650002002067650001702087650002202104650001302126650002002139650001002159650002002169650001502189651001302204653002602217653001702243653002502260653002102285653001902306700001602325700002102341700002102362700006102383773011602444856008302560852000902643655001202652IND60653827420221117081125.0190807e201907  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065382742DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ufug.2019.1263932doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTaib, Nooriati1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7788-958X14aThe Performance Of Different Ornamental Plant Species In Transitional Spaces In Urban High-Rise Settings  aThe contributions of plants and trees towards improving thermal comfort are important in tropical countries where they are exposed to high levels of solar radiation. In urban high-rise settings, the incorporation of landscaping is crucial in providing a green space that helps to improve the microclimate and to ensure the psychological well-being of its users. This paper examines the similarities and differences in the amount of filtered radiation among different tropical plant species in three different locations within a building, indicating the suitability of plants in a high-rise setting. The fieldwork measurement was conducted on 8 ornamental plant species in three different landscape areas of a 21-story office high-rise building in Penang, Malaysia. The radiation filtered underneath the plants and its Leaf Area Index (LAI) were measured. The study examined the relationship between the LAI of each existing plant species and the amount of solar radiation filtered by the plant’s canopy. An ANOVA partial F-test was used in this study to indicate the amount of solar radiation filtered by each plant species at a given LAI and its transmissivity value in each of the landscaped gardens. The results showed that the radiation filtration effect is highly dependent on the LAI. Other contributing factors, such as branching density and branching pattern, that affect the radiation absorbed by the plants were also observed. However, appropriate species selection needs to be considered before planting in a place with high wind velocity and a high amount of sun exposure.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanalysis of variance 3abranching 3acanopy 3afiltration 3agardens 3agreen infrastructure 3alandscapes 3alandscaping 3aleaf area index 3amicroclimate 3aornamental plants 3aplanting 3asolar radiation 3atrees 3atropical plants 3awind speed 3aMalaysia 0aLeaf area index (LAI) 0aPlant canopy 0aRadiation filtration 0aSkyrise greenery 0aTransmissivity1 aAli, Zalila1 aAbdullah, Aldrin1 aYeok, Foong Swee1 aPrihatmanti, Rani1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6523-73570 tUrban forestry & urban greening.g2019 July, v. 43 p.126393-dElsevier GmbHwJournal:jnl893556x1618-86677nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ufug.2019.1263933Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03680naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002500151245009100176520207700267592002802344650001902372650001502391650002102406650001402427650001102441650002902452650001502481650001702496650001902513650002202532650001802554650001702572650002102589650002602610650002202636650002202658650001302680650001602693650001302709653002702722653002702749653002602776653001202802700005902814700002102873700002202894700002102916773011802937856008603055852000903141655001203150IND60763936120221120074135.0220606e20220401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076393612DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jenvman.2022.1145322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSreenivasan, Shravan12aA polymeric Brønsted acid ionic liquid mediated liquefaction of municipal solid waste  aThe rapid industrialization and population explosion continuously generate massive amounts of municipal waste. Several conventional processes are in practice for the treatment of municipal waste, but the requirement of stringent operating conditions, incomplete conversion, longer processing time and emission of toxic gases, etc., are the major associated barriers. Thus, there is an urgent requirement for a sustainable, environmentally feasible process that can process waste into energy and fuel products. In the present manuscript, polyethylenimine functionalized polymeric Bronsted acid ionic liquid (PolyE-IL) catalysts have been explored for the Catalytic Thermo Liquefaction (CTL) of organic biodegradable municipal solid waste (MSW). A series of PolyE-IL catalysts with variable counter ions were examined for CTL of MSW. Of all the tested PolyE-IL catalysts, the integration of [PEI]⁺[HSO₄]⁻ gave excellent MSW conversion (>85%) and yield (>80%) of liquefied products (CTL-Oil) under non-stringent reaction conditions and without any formation char and gases. The influence of reaction conditions such as catalyst concentration, reaction temperature, time, slurry concentration, and type of feedstock of conversion and yield are studied. The column adsorption and membrane separation process was integrated to facilitate the catalyst and CTL-Oil separation. A series of commercially available hydrophobic resins were tested to separate catalyst and CTL-Oil. ICT005 showed the highest adsorption efficiency of all tested resins with 35.46 mg/mL of binding capacity and Kd of 0.02159. The physicochemical properties of CTL-Oil were studied in detail by using various analytical tools, which exhibited that CTL-Oil comprises a mixture of small and large molecular weight organic compounds and has a calorific value of 4000 kcal/kg; hence it could be used for further energy and fuel applications. Thus, the reported CTL process can be beneficial to resolve both environmental and fossil fuel dependency issues simultaneously by converting MSW into CTL-Oil.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBronsted acids 3aadsorption 3abiodegradability 3acatalysts 3aenergy 3aenvironmental management 3afeedstocks 3afossil fuels 3ahydrophobicity 3aindustrialization 3aionic liquids 3aliquefaction 3amolecular weight 3amunicipal solid waste 3apolyethyleneimine 3apopulation growth 3aslurries 3atemperature 3atoxicity 0aCatalytic liquefaction 0aPolymeric ionic liquid 0aMunicipal solid waste 0aCTL-Oil1 aGotmare, Akshay1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5642-52301 aUkarde, Tejas M.1 aPandey, Preeti H.1 aPawar, Hitesh S.0 tJournal of environmental management.g2022 Apr. 01, v. 307 p.114532-dElsevier LtdwJournal:2018x0301-47977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2022.1145323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02871naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245008500169300001800254520146200272592002801734650002301762650001601785650002001801650000901821650001401830650001301844650001601857650001301873650001501886650001601901650001301917653001901930653000601949653001901955653001601974653001501990653001302005653001702018653001502035700003002050700002302080700005902103773013302162856008502295852000902380655001202389IND60733000920221118034533.0210402e20201216xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073300092DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jproteome.0c006022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDermit, Maria10aPeptide Correlation Analysis (PeCorA) Reveals Differential Proteoform Regulation  ap. 1972-1980.  aShotgun proteomics techniques infer the presence and quantity of proteins using peptide proxies produced by cleavage of the proteome with a protease. Most protein quantitation strategies assume that multiple peptides derived from a protein will behave quantitatively similar across treatment groups, but this assumption may be false due to (1) heterogeneous proteoforms and (2) technical artifacts. Here we describe a strategy called peptide correlation analysis (PeCorA) that detects quantitative disagreements between peptides mapped to the same protein. PeCorA fits linear models to assess whether a peptide’s change across treatment groups differs from all other peptides assigned to the same protein. PeCorA revealed that ∼15% of proteins in a mouse microglia stress data set contain at least one discordant peptide. Inspection of the discordant peptides shows the utility of PeCorA for the direct and indirect detection of regulated post-translational modifications (PTMs) and also for the discovery of poorly quantified peptides. The exclusion of poorly quantified peptides before protein quantity summarization decreased false-positives in a benchmark data set. Finally, PeCorA suggests that the inactive isoform of prothrombin, a coagulation cascade protease, is more abundant in plasma from COVID-19 patients relative to non-COVID-19 controls. PeCorA is freely available as an R package that works with arbitrary tables of quantified peptides.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCOVID-19 infection 3acoagulation 3adata collection 3amice 3aneuroglia 3apeptides 3aproteinases 3aproteome 3aproteomics 3aprothrombin 3aresearch 0aquantification 0aR 0abioinformatics 0acomputation 0aproteoform 0aproteins 0alinear model 0astatistics1 aPeters-Clarke, Trenton M.1 aShishkova, Evgenia1 aMeyer, Jesse G.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2753-39260 tJournal of proteome research.g2020 Dec. 16, v. 20, no. 4 p.1972-1980dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23605x1535-39077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jproteome.0c006023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02463naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002600151245017200177300001700349520108100366592002801447650002501475650001701500650001401517650002901531650002301560650001301583650000901596650001201605653005501617653003601672653004101708653002601749653004601775700001901821700001601840773011401856856008601970852000902056655001202065IND60628630820221120113546.0190319e20190401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062863082DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2019.01.1312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPérez-Torres, Alicia10aMethodology for planning environmental management systems by drawing upon the Industrial Emissions Directive: A case study at a Spanish metal surface treatment company  ap. 992-1004.  aCompanies with an IPPC Permit have a high commitment to environmental improvement and are at a good starting point for the implementation of an Environmental Management System (EMS). The results of a survey of companies with IPPC Permits indicate that 45% do not have an EMS, although 44% of them have considered the possibility of implementing one. The "PLANGESMA″ methodology allows companies that have an IPPC permit to plan an EMS based on the ISO 14001: 2015 Standard, facilitating the identification of environmental aspects and legal requirements based on the terms of the IPPC permit, and the development of an environmental improvement plan. The identification and assessment of environmental aspects is made with a combination of risk assessment-based and criterion-based methods. This new methodology is validated with the Validation Square framework and applied as a case study at a Spanish company in the metal surface treatment sector. The results highlight the possibility of promoting Resource Efficient and Cleaner Production with a relatively small effort.  aPublisher supplied data 3abusiness enterprises 3acase studies 3aemissions 3aenvironmental management 3amanagement systems 3aplanning 3arisk 3asurveys 0aIntegrated pollution prevention and control permit 0aEnvironmental management system 0aEnvironmental performance indicators 0aEnvironmental aspects 0aResource efficient and cleaner production1 aVidal, Rosario1 aTena, Jose,0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2019 Apr. 01, v. 215 p.992-1004dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2019.01.1313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02176naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001900145245006600164300001400230500002000244520122100264592002801485650002701513650001701540650001301557650001301570650001201583700001801595700002801613773013301641856007901774852000901853655001201862IND60593998520221118013206.0180508e201804  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059399852DNAL7 a10.1111/1541-4329.121372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWakeling, Lara10aePortfolios and Reflective Practice for Food Science Students  ap. 52-59.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe study investigated students’ perceptions and attitudes toward the use of ePortfolios for reflective practice as a learning and teaching strategy. A mixed‐method approach was applied to the study in a first‐year food science unit, at a regional Australian university. Data were generated via 3 sources, in order to provide the evidential basis for the investigation, including: a mixed method survey, access to student's exam results, and students’ ePortfolio reflections. The findings identified 3 key positive aspects. First, a variety of assessment methods was key to enhancing the overall learning of 1st‐year food science students. Second, ePortfolio reflective writing can be a key aspect for improved student engagement. Finally, structured ePortfolio sessions can help food science students consolidate knowledge, while also allowing them to encounter new ideas related to food science theory and develop technical knowledge. However, technological issues with using an ePortoflio can cloud the value of the reflective task for some students. Recommendations are made for how to better support and implement reflective practice using ePortfolios to enhance the learning of food science students.  aPublisher supplied data 3aattitudes and opinions 3afood science 3alearning 3astudents 3asurveys1 aAldred, Peter1 aHains‐Wesson, Rachael0 tJournal of food science education.g2018 Apr., v. 17, no. 2 p.52-59dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:J000000141x1541-43297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1541-4329.121373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02635naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100005800151245008000209300001800289520135100307592002801658650001901686650002201705650002301727650002601750650002201776650001701798650001301815650001501828650002001843650001301863653001401876653001301890653001001903653001801913653000701931700006001938773013301998856008502131852000902216655001202225IND60733001020221118034352.0210402e20210312xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073300102DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jproteome.0c006182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMcCabe, Antony1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3089-367410alcmsWorld: High-Performance 3D Visualization Software for Mass Spectrometry  ap. 1981-1985.  aComplex biological samples, in particular, in proteomics and metabolomics research, are often analyzed using mass spectrometry paired with liquid chromatography or gas chromatography. The chromatography stage adds a third dimension (retention time) to the usual 2D mass spectrometry output (mass/charge, detected ion counts). Experimental results are often discovered by complex computational analysis, but it is not always possible to know if the data has been correctly interpreted. To perform quality-control checks, it can often be helpful to verify the results by manually examining the raw data, and it is typically easier to understand the data in a graphical, rather than numerical, form. 3D graphics hardware is present in most modern computers but is rarely utilized by bioinformatics software, even when the data to be viewed are naturally 3D. lcmsWorld is new software that uses graphics hardware to quickly and smoothly examine and compare LC-MS data. A preprocessing step allows the software to subsequently access any area of the data instantly at multiple levels of detail. The data can then be freely navigated while the software automatically selects, loads, and displays the most appropriate detail. lcmsWorld is open source.

Since dogs are not native to the region, it has been postulated that the natural host of B. rossi is an indigenous African canid. Although various attempts at artificial infection indicated that black-backed jackals (Canis mesomelas) could become subclinically infected with B. rossi, data on occurrence of B. rossi in free-ranging jackals was lacking. A long-term behaviour study in which free-ranging black-backed jackals were radio-collared offered the opportunity of collecting blood specimens from a large number of free-ranging jackals. METHODS: Genomic DNA was extracted from the EDTA blood samples (n = 107). PCR products were subjected to Reverse Line Blot hybridization using Theileria and Babesia genera-specific as well as 28 species-specific oligonucleotide probes, including Babesia canis, Babesia rossi, Babesia vogeli and Babesia gibsoni. The near full-length parasite 18S rRNA gene was amplified from two selected samples (free-ranging jackals), cloned and a total of six recombinants were sequenced. RESULTS: Of 91 free-ranging jackals, 77 (84.6%) reacted with the Babesia genus-specific probe; 27 (29.7%) also reacted with the B. rossi probe. Of 16 captive jackals, 6 (37.5%) reacted with the B. rossi probe, while one further sample reacted with the Babesia genus-specific probe only. After cloning, 6 recombinants yielded identical sequences identical to that of B. rossi (L19079) and differing by 2 base pairs from B. rossi (DQ111760) in GenBank. The observed sequence similarities were confirmed by phylogenetic analyses using neighbour joining and maximum parsimony. CONCLUSIONS: Black-backed jackals are natural hosts of B. rossi.  aPublisher supplied data  aFBIP Grant 98110cNational Research Foundation0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aBabesia canis subsp. rossi 3aBabesia canis subsp. vogeli 3aBabesia gibsoni 3aCanis 3aDNA 3aEDTA (chelating agent) 3aHaemaphysalis 3aTheileria 3ababesiosis 3ablood 3ablood sampling 3adogs 3agenes 3ahosts 3ajackals 3anucleic acid hybridization 3aoligonucleotide probes 3aparasites 3aphylogeny 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aribosomal RNA 3asequence homology 3avirulence 3aSub-Saharan Africa1 aVorster, Ilse1 aHarrison-White, Robert F.1 aOosthuizen, Marinda C.0 tParasites & vectors.g2017 Dec., v. 10, no. 1 p.124-124dBioMed CentralwJournal:24143x1756-33057nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13071-017-2057-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03006naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002100140245012300161300001800284520133300302592002801635650001601663650001901679650002601698650002401724650000901748650002501757650001301782650001301795650001701808650002501825650001301850650002301863650001901886650002901905650001701934650003001951700001901981700002102000700001702021700002002038700002102058700002302079700002002102700002002122700001902142700001602161700002302177700002402200773014402224856007502368852000902443655001202452IND60793453020221119214639.0220916e20220915xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079345302DNAL7 a10.1039/d2tb00481j2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKitayama, Yukiya10aIn vivo stealthified molecularly imprinted polymer nanogels incorporated with gold nanoparticles for radiation therapy  ap. 6784-6791.  aRadiation therapy is a representative therapeutic approach for cancer treatment, wherein the development of efficient radiation sensitizers with low side effects is critical. In this study, a novel stealth radiation sensitizer based on Au-embedded molecularly imprinted polymer nanogels (Au MIP-NGs) was developed for low-dose X-ray radiation therapy. Surface plasmon resonance measurements reveal the good affinity and selectivity of the obtained Au MIP-NGs toward the target dysopsonic protein, human serum albumin. The protein recognition capability of the nanogels led to the formation of the albumin-rich protein corona in the plasma. The Au MIP-NGs acquire stealth capability in vivo through protein corona regulation using the intrinsic dysopsonic proteins. The injection of Au MIP-NGs improved the efficiency of the radiation therapy in mouse models of pancreatic cancer. The growth of the pancreatic tumor was inhibited even at low X-ray doses (2 Gy). The novel strategy reported in this study for the synthesis of stealth nanomaterials based on nanomaterial–protein interaction control shows significant potential for application even in other approaches for cancer treatment, diagnostics, and theranostics. This strategy paves a way for the development of a wide range of effective nanomedicines for cancer therapy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-radiation 3acancer therapy 3adiagnostic techniques 3ahuman serum albumin 3amice 3amolecular imprinting 3ananogels 3ananogold 3ananomedicine 3apancreatic neoplasms 3apolymers 3aprecision medicine 3aprotein corona 3aradio-sensitizing agents 3aradiotherapy 3asurface plasmon resonance1 aYamada, Takuya1 aKiguchi, Kentaro1 aYoshida, Aoi1 aHayashi, Shuhei1 aAkasaka, Hiroaki1 aIgarashi, Kazunori1 aNishimura, Yuya1 aMatsumoto, Yū,1 aSasaki, Ryohei1 aTakano, Eri1 aSunayama, Hirobumi1 aTakeuchi, Toshifumi0 tJournal of materials chemistry B.g2022 Sept. 15, v. 10, no. 35 p.6784-6791dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26902x2050-75187nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d2tb00481j3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02671naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001500146245014900161300001800310520107400328650002801402650001401430650001601444650001401460650002301474650000901497650002001506650002101526650001901547650002101566650002201587650001801609650001801627650003201645650002001677650001801697650002701715650001901742650000701761650001401768650001601782650003201798651001001830700001801840700002201858700002701880700001601907773016201923856004702085852000902132655001202141IND60517592420221119104621.0160401e20150422xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051759242DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jafc.5b001062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDan, Xiuli10aPurification and Characterization of a Novel Hemagglutinin with Inhibitory Activity toward Osteocarcinoma Cells from Northeast China Black Beans  ap. 3903-3914.  aIn the present study, we isolated a novel hemagglutinin from an edible legume and explored its growth-inhibitory effect on osteocarcinoma and liver cancer cells. The protein was purified by liquid chromatography techniques which entailed affinity chromatography on Affi-gel blue gel, ion-exchange chromatography on Mono Q, and gel filtration on Superdex 75 with an FPLC system. The hemagglutinating activity of this hemagglutinin was demonstrated to be ion dependent and stable over a wide range of temperature and pH values. Antiproliferative activity was observed in the tumor cell lines MG-63 and HepG2 but not in the normal cell line WRL 68. Osteocarcinoma cells treated with the hemagglutinin underwent obvious cell shrinkage, chromatin condensation, mitochondrial membrane depolarization, and apoptosis. The mRNA expression level of interleukin-2 (IL-2), interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β), interferon-gamma (IFN-γ), and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) were found to be up-regulated to different extents after treatment of this hemagglutinin. 3aaffinity chromatography 3aapoptosis 3ablack beans 3achromatin 3agel chromatography 3agels 3agene expression 3ahemagglutination 3ahemagglutinins 3ainterferon-gamma 3ainterleukin-1beta 3ainterleukin-2 3ainterleukin-6 3aion exchange chromatography 3aliver neoplasms 3amessenger RNA 3amitochondrial membrane 3aneoplasm cells 3apH 3ashrinkage 3atemperature 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha 3aChina1 aWong, Jack Ho1 aFang, Evandro Fei1 aChan, Francis Chun Wai1 aNg, Tzi Bun0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2015 Apr. 22, v. 63, no. 15 p.3903-3914dAmerican Chemical Society, Books and Journals Divisionx0021-85617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jafc.5b00106  aDNAL 7aarticle02998naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003600135040001800171100001800189245006900207300001600276506007600292520121200368592002801580506003701608650002901645650002801674650001001702650001901712650002201731650002501753650002601778650001101804650002801815650002801843650003901871650004301910650002301953650003901976650001902015650002002034650002802054650005202082650006102134650004902195700003102244700002002275773008202295856008202377852000902459655001202468IND60098987020221207095108.0141105e20120910xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009898702DNAL7 a226920062pmid7 aPMC34129212pmcid7 a10.1016/j.gene.2012.06.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHansen, Loren10aDifferences in local genomic context of bound and unbound motifs  ap. 125-134.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aUnderstanding gene regulation is a major objective in molecular biology research. Frequently, transcription is driven by transcription factors (TFs) that bind to specific DNA sequences. These motifs are usually short and degenerate, rendering the likelihood of multiple copies occurring throughout the genome due to random chance as high. Despite this, TFs only bind to a small subset of sites, thus prompting our investigation into the differences between motifs that are bound by TFs and those that remain unbound. Here we constructed vectors representing various chromatin- and sequence-based features for a published set of bound and unbound motifs representing nine TFs in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Using a machine learning approach, we identified a set of features that can be used to discriminate between bound and unbound motifs. We also discovered that some TFs bind most or all of their strong motifs in intergenic regions. Our data demonstrate that local sequence context can be strikingly different around motifs that are bound compared to motifs that are unbound. We concluded that there are multiple combinations of genomic features that characterize bound or unbound motifs.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3aartificial intelligence 3agenes 3aintergenic DNA 3amolecular biology 3anucleotide sequences 3atranscription factors 3ayeasts 2aArtificial Intelligence 2aBinding Sitesxgenetics 2aDNA, Fungalxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aDNA, Intergenicxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aDatabases, Genetic 2aGene Expression Regulation, Fungal 2aGenome, Fungal 2aModels, Genetic 2aNucleosomesxmetabolism 2aSaccharomyces cerevisiaexgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aSaccharomyces cerevisiae Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aTranscription Factorsxgeneticsxmetabolism.1 aMariño-Ramírez, Leonardo1 aLandsman, David0 tGene.g2012 Sept. 10, v. 506, no. 1 p.125-134dElsevier B.V.x0378-11197nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gene.2012.06.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01939naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100001700154245011800171300001400289506002800303520055200331592002800883506003700911650002500948650002200973650001400995650001201009650001101021650001901032650001301051650001001064650001301074653003301087653002501120653002101145653001401166700001901180700001401199773020601213856008901419852000901508655001201517IND60784611320221207101839.0180524e201709  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078461132DNAL7 a10.17721/1728_2748.2016.72.60-632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKavulych, Y.10aChange in the content of xanthones and lignin in buckwheat and wheat plants under salicylic acid and cadmium ions  ap. 60-63.  aResource is Open Access  aInvestigated the effect of cadmium and salicylic acid on phenols content (хanthones, lignin) in plants buckwheat (Fagopyrum esculentum Moench.) and wheat (Triticum aestivum L.).

Structural analysis revealed that this new metabolite was 3-hydroxy-1,7-bis(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl)heptane by comparing it to the reported optically active compound rubranol, which has 3R stereochemistry. In order to determine the absolute stereochemistry of the secondary alcohol of this metabolite, we synthesized its racemic tetramethyl derivative. From HPLC analysis that separate the synthetic sample to two peaks, this metabolite was optically active and was primarily an enantiomer of rubranol. We also compared the activities of curcumin and the metabolite using monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) which is produced in vitro by murine adipocytes. The metabolite exhibited an inhibition effect associated with the production of MCP-1, which was similar to that of curcumin with attenuated cytotoxicity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactive ingredients 3aadipocytes 3aalcohols 3abacteria 3achemokine CCL2 3acurcumin 3acytotoxicity 3aenantiomers 3afeces 3aheptane 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3aintestinal microorganisms 3ametabolism 3ametabolites 3amice 3astereochemistry 0aCurcumin 0a3-Hydroxy-1,7-bis(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl)heptane 0aIntestinal microflora 0aMetabolite1 aYokoyama, Shin-ichiro1 aMochizuki, Mika1 aOsawa, Toshihiko0 tJournal of functional foods.g2019 Oct., v. 61 p.103463-dElsevier LtdwJournal:J000000142x1756-46467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jff.2019.1034633Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02259naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002500146245010300171300001800274520101300292650002001305650001901325650004301344650001101387650001301398650001301411650000801424650001501432650002001447650002101467700002401488700003701512700002801549700003901577700003901616773016201655856004701817852000901864655001201873IND60517592620221119104631.0160404e20150422xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051759262DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jafc.5b008832doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLeal-Diaz, Ana Maria10aEffect of Agave americana and Agave salmiana Ripeness on Saponin Content from Aguamiel (Agave Sap)  ap. 3924-3930.  aSteroidal saponins have shown beneficial health effects. Agave spp. leaves and rhizomes are sources of these compounds, but their presence has not been reported in the aguamiel. Aguamiel is the sweet edible sap from mature agave, and its quality is influenced by the plant ripening stage. The purpose of this research was to identify and quantitate saponins in aguamiel from Agave americana and Agave salmiana at two ripening stages. Saponins and sapogenins were identified with HPLC/ESI-MS/TOF and quantitated with HPLC/ELSD. Results proved the presence of saponins derived from kammogenin, manogenin, gentrogenin, and hecogenin. The saponin content in aguamiel from immature A. salmiana was 2-fold higher (478.3 protodioscin equivalents (PE) μg/g aguamiel (DM)) compared with A. americana (179.0 PE μg/g aguamiel (DM)).

This should be considered before evaluating the effects of Agave spp. as a source of bioactive saponins. 3aAgave americana 3aAgave salmiana 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3aleaves 3arhizomes 3aripening 3asap 3asapogenins 3asexual maturity 3asteroid saponins1 aSantos-Zea, Liliana1 aMartinez-Escobedo, Hilda Cecilia1 aGuajardo-Flores, Daniel1 aGutiérrez Uribe, Janet Alejandra,1 aSerna Saldívar, Sergio R.

However, enhancing the separation efficiency of photo-generated carriers at interface and adsorption ability of surface have become the bottleneck problem to further improve the room temperature gas sensing performance of MoS₂-based heterojunctions under light assistance. In the present study, a novel direct Z-scheme MoS₂/SnO₂ heterojunction was designed through crystal facets engineering and its room temperature gas sensing properties under light assistance was studied. It was found that the heterojunction showed outstanding room temperature NO₂ sensing performance with a high response of 208.66 toward 10 ppm NO₂, together with excellent recovery characteristics and selectivity. The gas sensing mechanism study suggested that high-energy {221} crystal facets of SnO₂ and MoS₂ directly formed Z-scheme heterojunction, which could greatly improve the separation efficiency of photo-generated carriers with high redox capacity. Moreover, {221} facets greatly enhanced adsorption ability towards NO₂. This work not only opens up the application of Z-scheme heterojunctions in gas sensing, which will greatly promotes the development of room temperature light-assisted gas sensors, but also provides a new idea for the construction of direct Z-scheme heterojunctions through crystal facets engineering.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3aambient temperature 3acrystals 3adesign 3aengineers 3agases 3ajournals 3asurfaces 3atoxic substances 3awills 0aLight assistance 0aNO2 0aGas sensing 0aZ-scheme 0aMoS21 aGong, Wufei1 aLi, Xin1 aLiu, Yuan1 aLiang, Yan1 aChen, Bin1 aYang, Yanxing1 aLuo, Xingfang1 aXu, Keng1 aYuan, Cailei0 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2022 Aug. 15, v. 436 p.129246-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6200x0304-38947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2022.1292463Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02691naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002100152245006600173300001400239520148100253592002801734650000801762650001301770650001101783650001601794650001301810650000901823650000901832650001801841650001101859653001801870653001801888653002601906653002301932653003301955700002801988700006102016773010802077856008702185852000902272655001202281IND60525660820221118031424.0190318e201605  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052566082DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jfoodeng.2015.08.0312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCaccavale, Paolo10aConjugate heat and mass transfer in drying: A modeling review  ap. 28-35.  aCoupled transfer mechanisms are common in a variety of industrial operations, as in food drying, and their virtualization is becoming indispensable. In this paper one such situation, a rectangular food chunk exposed to heat and mass transfer by a turbulent cross flow of air in a channel (Re ≃ 1·104), is investigated by modeling the transfer mechanisms (linked each other by evaporation) in conjunction with the inherent flow transport. This formulation is referred to as a conjugate problem.In the present model, the most limiting parameters that commonly are employed in such studies can be disregarded, i.e. the empirical heat and mass transfer coefficients at the auxiliary air/substrate interface: they refer to unrealistical average conditions and unspecified geometry variations.After proper literature evaluation, the solution of a benchmark drying problem is discussed by assessing the conjugate and coupled features of the analytical development, focusing on some transfer phenomena loci on the sample's exposed surface. It is shown that, in case of a finite protrusion with a unitary form factor (height equals streamwise thickness) the average Nusselt number of about 25 (resumed from associated literature) greatly overestimates the one computed based on the model, everywhere along the exposed surface and during process time: varying up to 6 times along the lateral edges and dropping down to an average value of about 6 after less than 2 h of treatment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3aair flow 3adrying 3aevaporation 3ageometry 3aheat 3aloci 3amass transfer 3amodels 0aHeat transfer 0aMass transfer 0aConjugate formulation 0aCoupled mechanisms 0aComputational fluid dynamics1 aDe Bonis, Maria Valeria1 aRuocco, Gianpaolo1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5342-32080 tJournal of food engineering.g2016 May, v. 176 p.28-35dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl34294x0260-87747nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jfoodeng.2015.08.0313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04213naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002200094024001900116024003500135040001800170100005800188245011800246300001200364506007600376520245400452592002802906596005902934596004402993506003703037650001703074650001803091650001503109650001003124650001003134650001903144650002003163650002703183650002603210650001503236650001103251650001603262650001403278650001603292650004303308650001403351650002503365651001003390651001103400700001503411700001403426700002003440773010803460856008203568852000903650655001203659IND60572290320221207065055.0220818e201712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057229032DNAL7 aPMC53400442pmcid7 a282647102pmid7 a10.1186/s13071-017-2066-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIshtiaq, Farah1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6762-701410aEstimating prevalence of avian haemosporidians in natural populations: a comparative study on screening protocols  ap. 127.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Birds harbour an astonishing diversity of haemosporidian parasites. Renewed interest in avian haemosporidians as a model system has placed a greater emphasis on the development of screening protocols to estimate parasite prevalence and diversity. Prevalence estimates are often based on the molecular or blood-smear microscopy techniques. However, variation in diagnostic sensitivity among screening methodologies represents a potential source of bias that may lead to erroneous inference in comparisons of prevalence across studies. Here, we analyzed a suite of blood samples for the presence of parasites using four diagnostic tools and compared method-specific estimates of detection probability to assess the relative performance of screening strategies. METHODS: We screened a total of 394 bird blood samples collected in India (n = 203) and Sweden (n = 191) for the combined presence of Plasmodium, Haemoproteus and Leucocytozoon with three PCR assays: (i) qPCR; (ii) restriction enzyme-based assay; and (iii) nested protocol. In addition, we examined blood smears for estimates of parasite intensity which was further screened using qPCR method to evaluate if parasite intensity shows a relationship with qPCR (Ct values). Furthermore, we used single infected samples from parasite intensities: low, medium, high, very high to establish the reproducibility in qPCR. RESULTS: For the combined data sets from India and Sweden, detection probability for submicroscopic and low intensity infections was highest for the qPCR method, followed by the nested protocol and the restriction enzyme-based assay. For high parasite intensities, the qPCR had high PCR reproducibility, with three out of three PCR replicates being positive and with consistent Ct values across all tenfold dilution series. For parasite intensities at very low and submicroscopic samples, the qPCR was reproducible in one out of the three replicates. The intensity of parasitemia estimated from smears showed inverse relationship with Ct values in both the Indian and Swedish data sets. CONCLUSIONS: Our study highlights the importance of accounting for methodological issues to better estimate infection in parasitological studies and illustrates how a wider deployment of diagnostic tools combined with statistical approaches is needed for each study, in order to provide adequate insight into the most appropriate approach to avoid erroneous inferences.  aPublisher supplied data  aIA/I(S)/12/2/500629cWellcome Trust/DBT India Alliance  a621-2013-4839cSwedish Research Council0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aHaemoproteus 3aLeucocytozoon 3aPlasmodium 3abirds 3ablood 3ablood sampling 3adata collection 3adiagnostic sensitivity 3adiagnostic techniques 3amicroscopy 3amodels 3aparasitemia 3aparasites 3aprobability 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3ascreening 3astatistical analysis 3aIndia 3aSweden1 aRao, Megha1 aHuang, Xi1 aBensch, Staffan0 tParasites & vectors.g2017 Dec., v. 10, no. 1 p.127-127dBioMed CentralwJournal:24143x1756-33057nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13071-017-2066-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02558naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002500151245012300176300001800299520122000317592002801537650002301565650001901588650002201607650001901629650001401648650001501662650002001677650001301697650001301710650002001723653001201743653002101755653001801776653001601794653001301810700002401823700006201847773013301909856008502042852000902127655001202136IND60733001520221118034208.0210402e20210108xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073300152DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jproteome.0c008402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKalmar, Jaclyn Gowen10aGlycoHunter: An Open-Source Software for the Detection and Relative Quantification of INLIGHT-Labeled N-Linked Glycans  ap. 1855-1863.  aGlycans are responsible for many biological activities; however, their structures are incredibly diverse and complex, often rendering the field of glycomics unsolvable by a single analytical technique. The development of multiple chemical derivatization strategies and bioinformatic software is responsible for some of the greatest analytical gains in the field of glycomics. The INLIGHT strategy is a chemical derivatization technique using hydrazide chemistry to derivatize the reducing end of N-linked glycans and incorporates either a natural (NAT, ¹²C₆) or a stable-isotope label (SIL, ¹³C₆) to carry out relative quantification. Here we present GlycoHunter, a user-friendly software created in MATLAB that enables researchers to accurately and efficiently process MS1 glycomics data where a NAT and SIL pair is generated for relative quantification, including but not limited to, INLIGHT. GlycoHunter accepts the commonly used data file formats imzML and mzXML and effectively identifies all peak pairs associated with NAT- and SIL-labeled N-linked glycans using MS1 data. It also includes the ability to tailor the search parameters and export the results for further analysis using Skyline or Excel.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanalytical methods 3abioinformatics 3acomputer software 3aderivatization 3aglycomics 3ahydrazides 3apolysaccharides 3aproteome 3aresearch 3astable isotopes 0aINLIGHT 0aN-linked glycans 0adata analysis 0aopen source 0asoftware1 aGarrard, Kenneth P.1 aMuddiman, David C.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2216-499X0 tJournal of proteome research.g2021 Jan. 08, v. 20, no. 4 p.1855-1863dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23605x1535-39077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jproteome.0c008403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01745naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100001700112245008700129300001400216506002800230520080600258592002801064506003701092650001401129650001801143650001301161650001801174650001401192653001801206653001501224653001401239700001701253773014001270852000901410655001201419IND60784611520221207101833.0130610e201306  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078461152DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMandrioli, M14aThe self/non-self dualism is still so marked as it was considered for a long time?  ap. 46-49.  aResource is Open Access  aFor several decades the immune system has been described mainly as a molecular machinery aimed to recognize and eliminate all the non-self molecules or organisms.

As a whole, the “defensive” role of immunity, described as highly prominent in several contexts of the modern biosciences, should be revised taking into account that the immune system defined during evolution which organisms have to be excluded and killed, and which have to be maintained.

The experiment was arranged using four cell lines, CL4, CL5, CL6, and CL12, differing in their embryogenic activity. The effect of treatment of cell cultures with Trichoderma peptides was manifested via significant growth stimulation of proliferating embryogenic cell lines, root growth stimulation, and formation of callus excrescences on regenerant plants. No difference between the treated and untreated variants was observed in seedlings. Conceivably, such peptide treatment may provide an increased immunity of soil-grown seedlings in forest nurseries. Study of the effect of biocontrol strains’ use in a plantation reforestation to stimulate the growth and development of calluses and embryos and to obtain disease-resistant regenerant plants of conifer species will provide the development of a clonal silviculture, a new trend that recently appeared abroad (Park 2002, 2014).  aPublisher supplied data 3aLarix sibirica 3aantimicrobial peptides 3aantimicrobial properties 3abiological control 3acallus 3aconifers 3adisease resistance 3aforests 3aimmunity 3ainduced resistance 3amorphogenesis 3areforestation 3aroot growth 3asilviculture1 aPark, M.

Wheat (Triticum aestivum L. cv. Gabo) was planted 9 June 1981 on half of the tilled plots resulting in five treatments randomized over plots in each of three replicates. Soil temperatures at the 50-mm depth and microclimate variables were measured every half hour in one replicate only. Soil water content in the surface 10 mm was measured at 0800 and 1600 h on work days in two replicates. Soil water profiles, plant heights, soil structure, and penetrometer resistances were determined at various times on selected plots and replicates during the growing season. June and July were unusually cool and wet and wheat growth was slow. After 12 August, wheat grown on rotovated plots was significantly taller and yielded more at harvest in December than wheat grown on scarified plots. Soil temperatures at 50 mm differed only slightly among treatments except for wheat vs. no-crop where the wheat plots had lower daytime soil temperatures after 8 September. Soil water in the surface 10 mm tended to be greater for scarified treatments than for rotovated treatments until late August. It was concluded that differences in wheat plant height were related to soil structure and soil water but not to soil temperature.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRhodoxeralfs 3aTriticum aestivum 3agrowing season 3amicroclimate 3aplant height 3asandy loam soils 3asoil structure 3asoil temperature 3asoil water 3asoil water content 3atillage 3awheat 3aSouth Australia1 aDexter, A.

The consequences of such shifts in vegetative habitat for fauna are poorly understood. Given differences in morphology and life history characteristics of rooted macrophytes and filamentous macroalgae, we hypothesized that these habitat types were not functionally redundant for small-bodied fishes and macroinvertebrates. We examined this hypothesis in spring-fed Florida rivers characterized by decreases in native rooted macrophytes and concomitant increases in filamentous macroalgae. Although faunal densities were generally greater in filamentous macroalgae than in rooted macrophytes, differences in the community assemblage structure suggest that the two types of vegetative habitat do not function interchangeably. Accordingly, continued replacement of rooted macrophytes with filamentous macroalgae is expected to affect the small fish and macroinvertebrate community, as well as higher trophic levels that depend on it.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaquatic environment 3afauna 3afish 3ahabitats 3alife history 3amacroalgae 3amacroinvertebrates 3arivers 3atrophic relationships 3aFlorida1 aStaudhammer, Christina L.1 aPine, William E., IIIcIII1 aTetzlaff, Jakob C.1 aFrazer, Thomas K.0 tHydrobiologia.g2014 Jan., v. 722, no. 1 p.159-170dSpringer-Verlagx0018-81587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-013-1694-3  aDNAL 7aarticle02250naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001500147245011200162520101900274592002801293650002801321650001401349650001301363650002001376650001401396650002101410650001301431650001301444653003301457653002301490653003401513653002601547700001601573700001701589700001701606700001401623700001401637773009801651856008201749852000901831655001201840IND60680608820221116180134.0200217e20200215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068060882DNAL7 a10.1016/j.lfs.2020.1172762doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYuan, Fang10aInhibition of mTORC1/P70S6K pathway by Metformin synergistically sensitizes Acute Myeloid Leukemia to Ara-C  aChemo-resistance still was the main obstacle for AML patients, more effective and less toxic forms of therapies were desperately needed. Metformin, a classic hypoglycemic drug for diabetes recently delivered us a new identity that it exerted anti-tumor activity through suppressing mTOR in various tumors. But the anti-tumor effect of metformin in AML was not clear.In this study, we used CCK8 assay and apoptosis assay to determine the anti-leukemia activity of metformin combined with AraC, and explore the mechanism of the joint role of Ara-C/metformin in AML. We finally used xenograft experiment in mice to determine the anti-leukemia effect of Ara-C/metformin in vivo.We found that metformin could synergistically sensitize AML cells to Ara-C via inhibiting mTORC1/P70S6K pathway. In vivo experiment also verified metformin in aid of Ara-C caused an obviously synergistic anti-tumor effect.We firstly found the synergistic anti-tumor effect of Ara-C/metformin in AML through inhibiting mTORC1/P70S6K pathway.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantineoplastic activity 3aapoptosis 3adiabetes 3ain vivo studies 3ametformin 3amyeloid leukemia 3apatients 3atoxicity 0aAcute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) 0aCytarabine (Ara-C) 0aSynergistic anti-tumor effect 0amTORC1/P70S6K pathway1 aCheng, Cong1 aXiao, Feiyan1 aLiu, Hongcai1 aCao, Shan1 aZhou, Gan0 tLife sciences.g2020 Feb. 15, v. 243 p.117276-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11720x0024-32057nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lfs.2020.1172763Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02644naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001900145245009000164300001600254520137000270592002801640650001201668650002401680650001301704650001801717650001601735650002201751650001401773650000901787650002101796650001701817650001901834653002401853653002101877653001101898653001801909700001901927700002001946700001401966700001801980773011001998856008102108852000902189655001202198IND60479921020221120054404.0160124e20100901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6047992102DNAL7 a10.1556/CRC.38.2010.3.82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKhoshro, H.

Allelic variation of the LMW-GS is associated with the significant differences of dough quality in bread and durum wheat, and has been widely evaluated at protein level in wheat and its relatives. In this study seven specific primers, specifically amplify genes located at the <i>Glu-A3</i> and <i>Glu-D3</i> loci, were employed to assay the length variation of LMW-GS genes in the A and D-genomes of diploid wheats. A total of 86 accessions of diploid wheats, including 10 accessions of <i>T. boeoticum</i> and 76 accessions of <i>Ae. tauschii</i> , were investigated. Seven alleles were detected in accessions of <i>T. boeoticum</i> (<i>Glu-A3</i> locus) by two pairs of specific primers and eighteen alleles were detected in accessions of <i>Ae. tauschii</i> (<i>Glu-D3</i> locus) by five pairs of specific primers. A higher level of allelic variation of LMW-GS was found in accession <i>T. boeoticum</i> and <i>Ae. tauschii</i> with Nei’s genetic variation index (H) of 0.82 and 0.92, respectively. This allelic variation could be used as valuable source for the enrichment of genetic variations and the alteration of flour-processing properties of the cultivated wheat.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalleles 3abreadmaking quality 3adiploidy 3adough quality 3adurum wheat 3agenetic variation 3aglutenins 3aloci 3amolecular weight 3aseed storage 3awild relatives 0alength polymorphism 0aspecific markers 0aLMW-GS 0adiploid wheat1 aBihamta, M.

It was demonstrated that the weight of mollusks increases throughout the study period by an S-type curve. The linear growth (shell diameter) follows a parabolic (convex) curve. Both weight and linear growth on a specified age range is well approximated by the Bertalanffy equation, while the interdependence between the shell weight and diameter by an allometric equation. The value of Bertalanffy equation coefficients is different in different individuals. The mean values of the growth constants in these equations for the weight and linear growth do not differ. Their value is 0.041 ± 0.004 weeks–¹. The species lifespan, which is determined by a product of the growth constant into maximal lifespan, is ≈4.5.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPlanorbarius corneus 3aallometry 3aaquaculture 3adeath 3aequations 3alongevity 3aontogeny 3apostlarvae 3asnails0 tRussian journal of developmental biology.g2018 Nov., v. 49, no. 6 p.381-387dPleiades PublishingwJournal:jnl4237922x1062-36047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1134/S10623604180900113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03724naa a2200805 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001300147245012200160520168800282592002801970650002101998650001402019650001402033650001402047650002402061650003502085650001202120650001802132650002002150650001402170650001302184650002402197650002602221650001302247650001402260653000702274653000702281653000802288653001002296653001202306653000802318653001402326653000902340653000902349653000902358653000902367653000802376653001102384653001102395653001202406653000702418653000902425653001102434653001602445653001002461653001002471653000802481653000902489653000802498653000802506653000802514653002502522653002302547653002102570653002202591700001702613700001802630700002002648700001502668700001702683700001702700773009802717856008202815852000902897655001202906IND60680608920221116175922.0200217e20200215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068060892DNAL7 a10.1016/j.lfs.2020.1172772doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Chao10aBerberine mitigates high glucose-induced podocyte apoptosis by modulating autophagy via the mTOR/P70S6K/4EBP1 pathway  aThis study aimed to investigate the characteristics and mechanism of autophagy on podocyte apoptosis under high glucose (HG) conditions and further explore the effect of berberine on podocyte autophagy, apoptosis and the potential mechanism.The levels of LC3II/I in podocytes stimulated with HG were detected at 0, 2, 4, 8, 12, 24, 36 and 48 h by western blotting. CCK-8 was used to detect the viability of podocytes. The level of autophagy was detected by western blotting, transmission electron microscopy and immunofluorescence. Podocyte apoptosis was analysed by using Hoechst staining, western blotting, annexin V/propidium iodide dual staining, and confocal microscopy. Then, podocytes were transfected with siRNA to silence mTOR, and the expression levels of proteins and mRNA involved in the mTOR/P70S6K/4EBP1 pathway were further investigated by western blotting and qRT-PCR.In this study, we found significantly reduced LC3II/LC3I and increased p62 in podocytes stimulated with HG for 24 h, and the level of autophagy reached a minimum at 24 h. Berberine restored podocyte viability and significantly attenuated HG-mediated inhibition of autophagy, as evidenced by the increased expression of LC3II/LC3I, the number of autophagosomes and the inhibition of p62. Moreover, berberine counteracted HG-induced podocyte apoptosis and injury, which was negatively correlated with the autophagy effect. Notably, silencing mTOR with siRNA augmented the inhibition of P70S6k and 4EBP1 phosphorylation, which was similar to the effect of berberine.Berberine activates podocyte autophagy by inhibiting the mTOR/P70S6K/4EBP1 signaling pathway, thereby alleviating podocyte apoptosis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aWestern blotting 3aapoptosis 3aautophagy 3aberberine 3aconfocal microscopy 3afluorescent antibody technique 3aglucose 3amessenger RNA 3aphosphorylation 3apropidium 3aproteins 3asignal transduction 3asmall interfering RNA 3astaining 3aviability 0aHG 0aDN 0aSTZ 0aPTECs 0acaspase 0aAtg 0aADSC-Exos 0amTOR 0aEGFR 0aPDCN 0aULK1 0aBBR 0aNF-κB 0aICAM-1 0aTGF-β1 0aFN 0aAMPK 0amTORC1 0ap70S6K/S6RP 0a4EBP1 0aNADPH 0aROS 0a3-MA 0aHCQ 0aGBM 0aECM 0aDiabetic nephropathy 0aPodocyte apoptosis 0aAutophagy effect 0aSignaling pathway1 aGuan, Xi-Mei1 aWang, Rui-Yao1 aXie, Yong-Sheng1 aZhou, Hong1 aNi, Wei-Jian1 aTang, Li-Qin0 tLife sciences.g2020 Feb. 15, v. 243 p.117277-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11720x0024-32057nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lfs.2020.1172773Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04063naa a2201345 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003600113040001800149100002800167245012400195300001600319520073000335592002801065650001601093650001001109650001301119650001401132650001301146650001101159650001501170650005801185650003701243650004101280650001101321650005101332650004101383650002001424650002201444650001101466650001101477650003801488650000901526650004301535650004001578650003601618650001401654650006601668650003901734651001101773653001001784653001001794653000901804653001001813653001201823653000801835653000801843653000801851653000901859653000801868653000701876653000801883653000801891653000701899653000801906653000901914653000901923653000901932653000601941653001301947653000901960653000601969653000701975653001001982653000701992653000601999653000902005653001302014653001002027653000902037653000702046653001002053653000702063653000802070653000702078653001002085653000802095653000902103653001602112653000802128653000902136653001002145653000902155653000802164653001002172653001102182653001202193653001102205653000802216653000902224653001102233653000602244653000902250653000702259653000702266653000602273653001002279653002102289653003702310653001802347653000902365653000902374700002702383700002902410700002502439700002802464700001902492700002902511773007402540856008202614852000902696655001202705IND60099072320221117201052.0161021e20130725xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009907232DNAL7 a236399592pmid7 a10.1016/j.gene.2013.04.0292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNeira, Vivian Alejandra13aDe novo MECP2 disomy in a Mexican male carrying a supernumerary marker chromosome and no typical Lubs syndrome features  ap. 381-385.  aXq28 duplication, including the MECP2 gene, is among the most frequently identified Xq subtelomeric rearrangements.

Despite gain of the MECP2 gene, the features of this patient do not evoke Lubs syndrome. Probably the mosaicism of the supernumerary marker chromosome is modifying the phenotype in this patient.  aPublisher supplied data 3achromosomes 3agenes 3apatients 3aphenotype 3aseizures 3aspeech 2aAdolescent 2aAndrogen-Insensitivity Syndromexgeneticsxpathology. 2aChromosome Duplicationxgenetics 2aCraniofacial Abnormalitiesxgenetics 2aFacies 2aFragile X Mental Retardation Proteinxgenetics 2aGenetic Diseases, X-Linkedxgenetics 2aGenetic Markers 2aGenetic Variation 2aHumans 2aInfant 2aIntellectual Disabilityxgenetics 2aMale 2aMethyl-CpG-Binding Protein 2xgenetics 2aMultiplex Polymerase Chain Reaction 2aNerve Tissue Proteinsxgenetics 2aPhenotype 2aPlasma Membrane Neurotransmitter Transport Proteinsxgenetics 2aSex Chromosome Disordersxgenetics 0aMexico 0aa-CGH 0aACSL4 0aAFF2 0aAGTR2 0aARHGEF6 0aarr 0aARX 0aBAC 0achrX 0aCGG 0acm 0aCpG 0aDCX 0adn 0aDNA 0aFISH 0aFMR1 0aFMR2 0ag 0aG-banded 0aGDI1 0ah 0ahg 0aHUWE1 0aID 0ai 0ai.e. 0aIL1RAPL1 0aIRAK1 0aISCN 0akg 0aL1CAM 0aLS 0amar 0aMb 0aMECP2 0aMIM 0aMLPA 0aMRC-Holland 0aMRX 0aNCBI 0aOPHN1 0aPAK3 0aPCR 0aPQBP1 0aRAB39B 0aRPS6KA3 0aSLC6A8 0aSNP 0asSMC 0aTSPAN7 0aX 0aXLID 0aXq 0aXY 0aY 0aMECP2 0aXq28 duplication 0aX-linked intellectual disability 0aLubs syndrome 0aMLPA 0asSMC1 aRomero-Espinoza, Pavel1 aRojas-Martínez, Augusto1 aOrtiz-López, Rocío1 aCórdova-Fletes, Carlos1 aPlaja, Alberto1 aBarros-Núñez, Patricio0 tGene.g2013 July 25, v. 524 p.381-385dElsevier B.V.x0378-11197nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gene.2013.04.0293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01506naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245011800159300002000277520039900297592002800696650002400724650001600748650001700764650001200781700002500793700001800818700001600836700002200852700002000874700003800894700001700932773012400949856007401073852000901147655001201156IND60666815320221116231319.0190919e20141014xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066681532DNAL7 a10.1039/c4ra08477b2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBell, Jacob P.10aN-Bromosuccinimide-based bromination and subsequent functionalization of hydrogen-terminated silicon quantum dots  ap. 51105-51110.  aWe report a mild, effective, room-temperature method for brominating and functionalizing colloidal hydrogen-terminated silicon quantum dots (H-SiQDs) using N-bromosuccinimide (NBS) as the bromination reagent.

In this study, a simple but comprehensive semidistributed modeling approach based on the generalized watershed loading function (GWLF) was modified to enable the accurate simulation of hydrology in watersheds. The frame of the original GWLF model (ORM), with a lumped hydrological parameter, was modified by adding channel routing processes, which made it possible to introduce the concept of subbasins. Then, the revised GWLF model was applied to the Luanhe watershed (30,000 km²) on a monthly bias in comparison with the ORM and the previously revised version. The sensitivity analysis and generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation (GLUE) uncertainty analysis were individually conducted to evaluate these modifications. Eventually, we compared four extreme conditions for the daily streamflow simulations of the three model versions in the Tunxi watershed but without calibration. All of the results indicated that the stability and accuracy of the model and the validity of the parameters were all enhanced and improved by the new revised version of the model, which provided reliable simulation results and indicated that it is a prospective tool to support watershed management.  aPublisher supplied data  a2017ZX07301-001-06cThe Major Science and Technology Program for Water Pollution Control and Treatment of China 3ahydrologic models 3apollutants 3asimulation models 3astream flow 3auncertainty 3auncertainty analysis 3awatershed hydrology 3awatershed management 3awatersheds1 aKang, Gelin1 aShen, Minli1 aWang, Yuqiu1 aChu, Chunli0 tWater resources management.g2019 Feb., v. 33, no. 3 p.923-937dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl44305x0920-47417nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11269-018-2149-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03320naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001600146245013400162300001600296520192900312592002802241650002202269650001202291650001402303650001402317650001402331650000902345650002102354650001602375650003902391650002702430650001002457651001002467653004402477653001102521653001102532653002602543700001602569700001602585700001502601700001702616700001602633773011002649856008202759852000902841655001202850IND60479921220221120054347.0160124e20100901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6047992122DNAL7 a10.1556/CRC.38.2010.3.102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDeng, Z.

In order to clear the subunits background of <i>Dwarf-Male-Sterile</i> wheat, sodium dodecyl sulphate polyacrylamide-gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) was used to detect the high and low molecular weight glutenin subunits (HMW-GS and LMW-GS) compositions in BC1F1, F2 and F3 generations from <i>Dwarf-Male-Sterile</i> wheat. Twenty-five alleles and 49 HMW-GS compositions at the <i>Glu-1</i> loci were detected in different generations. Null and subunit 1 were mainly existed at <i>Glu-A1</i> , and 7 + 8 and 7 + 9 were primarily detected at <i>Glu-B1</i> in different generations. Subunit combination 5 + 10 mainly appeared in BC1F1, while 2 + 12 major presented in F2 and F3 generations. HMW-GS compositions null, 7 + 8, 5 + 10 and null, 7 + 9, 5 + 10 showed higher frequencies than other banding patterns, followed by null, 14 + 15, 5 + 10 and null, 7 + 9, 2 + 12 combinations. In addition, some rare subunit combinations such as 14 + 15, 13 + 16, 17 + 18, 4 + 12, 2 + 10 and 5 + 12 were found in different generations. Eighteen alleles and 51 LMW-GS compositions at <i>Glu-3</i> loci were found in different generations. <i>Glu-A3</i> a and <i>Glu-B3</i> d showed higher frequencies than others among three generations. There were mainly a, b, c alleles at <i>Glu-D3</i> . Thirty, 31 and 14 different combinations were detected in BC1F1, F2 and F3 populations, respectively. There were some good combinations such as <i>A3</i> d/ <i>B3</i> h, <i>A3</i> d/ <i>B3</i> d/ <i>D3</i> a, <i>A3</i> b/ <i>B3</i> b/ <i>D3</i> a, <i>A3</i> a/ <i>B3</i> d/ <i>D3</i> a for different quality characteristics. So some desirable subunit combinations could be selected from different generations and new cultivars with good quality under distinct subunits background should be bred from <i>Dwarf-Male-Sterile</i> wheat in future.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTriticum aestivum 3aalleles 3acultivars 3agermplasm 3aglutenins 3aloci 3amolecular weight 3anew variety 3apolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 3asodium dodecyl sulfate 3awheat 3aChina 0aChinese <i>Dwarf-Male-Sterile</i> wheat 0aHMW-GS 0aLMW-GS 0adifferent generations1 aTian, J.

Its canonical compartment is the endoplasmic reticulum, where it acts as a chaperone and redox catalyst, but non canonical locations have been described as well, and ERp57 has been found associated with DNA and nuclear proteins. In previous work performed in HeLa cells, ERp57 has been demonstrated to bind specific DNA sequences involved in the stress response. The direct interaction with the DNA sequences identified as ERp57-targeted regions in HeLa cells has now been confirmed in a melanoma cell line. Furthermore, the ERp57 silencing, achieved by RNA interference, has produced a significant down-regulation of the expression of target genes. The possible involvement of other proteins in complex with ERp57 has been studied by an in vitro biotin–streptavidin based binding assay and the interacting protein APE/Ref-1 has been also assessed for its direct association with the ERp57 target regions. In conclusion, nuclear ERp57 interacts in vivo with DNA fragments in melanoma cells and is potentially involved in the transcriptional regulation of its target genes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aRNA interference 3acalnexin 3acalreticulin 3aendoplasmic reticulum 3agenes 3aglycoproteins 3amelanoma 3anuclear genome 3anuclear proteins 3anucleotide sequences 3aplasma membrane 3aprotein disulfide-isomerase 3astress response 3atranscription (genetics) 2aCell Line, Tumor 2aChromatin Immunoprecipitation 2aCisplatinxmetabolism 2aDNA, Neoplasmxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aDNA-(Apurinic or Apyrimidinic Site) Lyasexgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aDNA-Binding Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aGene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic 2aHumans 2aProtein Binding 2aProtein Disulfide-Isomerasesxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aProtein Interaction Mapping 2aRNA Interference 2aRNA, Small Interferingxgeneticsxmetabolism. 0aAPE/Ref-1 0aChIP 0acis-DDP 0aERp57/PDIA3 0aETS1 0aKu86 0aLRBA 0aM14 0aMSH6 0aPARP1 0aRNAi 0aRPS27A 0aSTAT3 0aTMEM126A 0aTranscriptional regulation 0aChromatin immunoprecipitation 0aRNA interference 0aMSH6 0aAPE/Ref-11 aGaucci, Elisa1 aArcangeli, Valentina1 aGrillo, Caterina1 aEufemi, Margherita1 aChichiarelli, Silvia0 tGene.g2013 July 25, v. 524 p.390-395dElsevier B.V.x0378-11197nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gene.2013.04.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02555naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245009400165300001800259520151400277592002801791650001101819650001601830650002001846650001501866650001101881650001401892650002301906700002101929700006201950773012602012856008202138852000902220655001202229IND60631011720221119214145.0191122e201902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063101172DNAL7 a10.1007/s11269-018-2178-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKumar, Ashish10aEvaluating Different Machine Learning Models for Runoff and Suspended Sediment Simulation  ap. 1217-1231.  aIn the present study, prediction of runoff and sediment at Polavaram and Pathagudem sites of the Godavari basin was carried out using machine learning models such as artificial neural network (ANN) and adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS). Different combinations of antecedent stage, current day stage and antecedent runoff for current day runoff prediction and antecedent runoff, current day runoff and antecedent sediment for current day sediment prediction were explored using Gamma test (GT) to select the effective input variables for runoff and sediment prediction. The performance during training and testing periods of the ANN and ANFIS models were evaluated quantitatively through various statistical indices and qualitative by visual observation. After comparing the qualified results of different ANN and ANFIS models it was found that ANN model with double hidden layers and ANFIS model with membership function (Triangular, 3) performed well for runoff and sediment predictions, respectively for Pathagudem site. ANFIS model with membership function (Triangular, 3) and ANFIS model with membership function (Gaussian, 3) shown the best results for runoff and sediment prediction, respectively, for Polavaram site. The effect of input variables on the selected models was also validated by the way of sensitivity analysis. The results of sensitivity analysis was found that the current day runoff mostly depends on present day stage and present day sediment depends on current day runoff.  aPublisher supplied data 3abasins 3afuzzy logic 3aneural networks 3aprediction 3arunoff 3asediments 3asuspended sediment1 aKumar, Pravendra1 aSingh, Vijay Kumar1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3606-00190 tWater resources management.g2019 Feb., v. 33, no. 3 p.1217-1231dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl44305x0920-47417nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11269-018-2178-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03311naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100002400166245018800190300001800378520179700396592002802193650002002221650003002241650002002271650001302291650002702304650002302331650001902354650002202373650001702395650001102412650001202423650001502435650002402450650001602474651001502490653002902505653002702534653001202561700002502573700002202598773013102620856008102751852000902832655001202841IND60651528020221120185140.0190711e201809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065152802DNAL7 a297176902pmid7 a10.1017/S13689800180009882doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMia, Mohammad Nahid10aSociodemographic and geographical inequalities in under- and overnutrition among children and mothers in Bangladesh: a spatial modelling approach to a nationally representative survey  ap. 2471-2481.  aTo investigate the sociodemographic and geographical variation in under- and overnutrition prevalence among children and mothers. Data from the 2014 Bangladesh Demographic and Health Survey were analysed. Stunting and wasting for children and BMI<18·5 kg/m² for mothers were considered as undernutrition; overweight was considered as overnutrition for both children and mothers. We estimated the prevalence and performed simple logistic regression analyses to assess the associations between outcome variables and predictors. Bayesian spatial models were applied to estimate region-level prevalence to identify the regions (districts) prone to under- and overnutrition. Children aged<5 years and their mothers aged 15–49 years in Bangladesh. A significant difference (P<0·001) was observed in both under- and overnutrition prevalence between poor and rich. A notable regional variation was also observed in under- and overnutrition prevalence. Stunting prevalence ranged from 20·3 % in Jessore to 56·2 % in Sunamgonj, wasting from 10·6 % in Dhaka to 19·2 % in Bhola, and overweight from 0·8 % in Shariatpur to 2·6 % in Dhaka. Of the sixty-four districts, twelve had prevalence of stunting and thirty-two districts had prevalence of wasting higher than the WHO critical threshold levels. Similarly, fifty-three districts had prevalence of maternal underweight higher than the national level. In contrast, the prevalence of overweight was comparatively high in the industrially equipped metropolitan districts. Observed sociodemographic and geographical inequalities imply slow progress in the overall improvement of both under- and overnutrition. Therefore, effective intervention programmes and policies need to be designed urgently targeting the grass-roots level of such regions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBayesian theory 3aWorld Health Organization 3abody mass index 3achildren 3ageographical variation 3agrowth retardation 3ahealth surveys 3aissues and policy 3amalnutrition 3amodels 3amothers 3aoverweight 3aregression analysis 3aunderweight 3aBangladesh 0aUnder- and overnutrition 0aBayesian spatial model 0aMapping1 aShafiqur Rahman, M.,1 aRoy, Paritosh K.,0 tPublic health nutrition.g2018 Sept., v. 21, no. 13 p.2471-2481dCambridge University PresswJournal:jnl56775x1475-27277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S13689800180009883Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02913naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245011400157300002000271520134000291592002801631650001301659650001201672650002801684650001801712650001701730650001501747650001401762650001301776650001801789650001001807650001501817650001001832650001101842650001901853650002101872650001801893650001201911650001501923650001201938650001301950650001701963650003301980650001402013700001702027700002002044700001402064700002602078700001602104700002002120773012402140856007402264852000902338655001202347IND60666815520221116231228.0190919e20141023xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066681552DNAL7 a10.1039/c4ra08481k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOyman, Gizem10aPeptide-modified conducting polymer as a biofunctional surface: monitoring of cell adhesion and proliferation  ap. 53411-53418.  aHere, we report the electropolymerization of 3-(2,5-di(thiophen-2-yl)-1H-pyrrol-1-yl)aniline monomer on indium tin oxide (ITO) glass and its use as a coating material for cell culture applications. Functional amino groups on the conducting polymer provide post-modification of the surface with the arginylglycylaspartic acid (RGD) peptide via EDC chemistry. Scanning electron microscopy, atomic force microscopy, and contact angle and surface conductivity measurements were carried out for the surface characterization. The peptide-conjugated surface was tested for adhesion and proliferation of several cell lines such as monkey kidney epithelial (Vero), human neuroblastoma (SH-SY5Y), and human immortalized skin keratinocyte (HaCaT). These cells were cultured on RGD-modified, polymer-coated ITO glass as well as conventional polystyrene surfaces for comparison. The data indicate that the RGD-modified surfaces exhibited better cell adhesion and proliferation among all surfaces compared. Cell imaging studies up to 72 h in length were performed on these surfaces using different microscopy techniques. Therefore, the novel biofunctional substrate is a promising candidate for further studies such as monitoring the effects of drugs and chemicals on cellular viability and morphology as well as cell-culture-on-a-chip applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadhesion 3aaniline 3aatomic force microscopy 3acell adhesion 3acell culture 3acell lines 3achemistry 3acoatings 3acontact angle 3adrugs 3aepithelium 3aglass 3ahumans 3aimage analysis 3aindium tin oxide 3akeratinocytes 3akidneys 3amonitoring 3amonkeys 3apeptides 3apolystyrenes 3ascanning electron microscopy 3aviability1 aGeyik, Caner1 aAyranci, Rukiye1 aAk, Metin1 aOdaci Demirkol, Dilek1 aTimur, Suna1 aCoskunol, Hakan0 tRSC advances.g2014 Oct. 23, v. 4, no. 96 p.53411-53418dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c4ra08481k3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03527naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245022000171500001900391520185800410592002802268650001502296650001902311650003202330650001602362650002702378650001102405650002202416650002002438650001402458650001702472650001202489650002102501650001702522650001102539650001002550653002902560653004002589653005202629653003602681653003002717700002302747700002002770700005902790773009002849856008502939852000903024655001203033IND60740494320221121002358.0210806e20211015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074049432DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2021.1210512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGhorbani, Bahram10aEnergy, exergy and pinch analyses of a novel energy storage structure using post-combustion CO2 separation unit, dual pressure Linde-Hampson liquefaction system, two-stage organic Rankine cycle and geothermal energy  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe cost of electricity production and its purchase price markedly differ at different hours of the day; therefore, the idea of storing electricity during off-peak hours (low price) and its use during peak hours (high price) is discussed. In this study, a novel integrated structure for separating CO₂ from the output smoke of a power plant using a chemical absorption unit via the post-combustion and CO₂ liquefaction method by the dual pressure Linde-Hampson liquefaction system during off-peak hours is developed. The low-temperature organic Rankine cycle and the gas turbine power production unit are used to produce power during peak hours. The post-combustion CO₂ separation unit produces 9307 kmol/h CO₂ from the power plant's output smoke by absorbing 249.6 MW heat flow from the geothermal energy and 24.42 MW power. At hours when the energy demand is low, the produced CO₂ is converted into condensed liquid form by receiving 18.31 MW power. When the demand for electric energy consumption is increased, this integrated structure produces 11.61 MW power. The multi-functional LCES system round trip and baseline LCES system exergy efficiencies are 36.75% and 58.48%, respectively. The exergy analysis results illustrate that the highest exergy destruction contribution in the equipment belongs to the fractionating columns (48.52%), heat exchangers (43.62%), and compressors (2.86%). The heat exchanger network related to the HE12, HE15, HE16, and HE18 multi-stream heat exchangers are extracted by pinch analysis. The sensitivity analysis illustrates that the exergy efficiency of the power generation cycle, baseline LCES plant, and multi-functional LCES structure increase up to 33.19%, 60.87%, and 21.14%, respectively when the pumped pressure of liquid carbon dioxide at peak consumption increases from 80 bar to 120 bar.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3acarbon dioxide 3aelectric energy consumption 3aelectricity 3aelectricity generation 3aexergy 3ageothermal energy 3aheat exchangers 3aheat flow 3aliquefaction 3aliquids 3apower generation 3apower plants 3aprices 3asmoke 0aEnergy storage structure 0aPost-combustion CO2 separation unit 0aDual pressure Linde-Hampson liquefaction system 0aTwo-stage organic Rankine cycle 0aExergy and pinch analyses1 aSalehi, Gholamreza1 aEbrahimi, Armin1 aTaghavi, Masoud1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9794-26080 tEnergy.g2021 Oct. 15, v. 233 p.121051-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2021.1210513Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02994naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004900094040001800143100001800161245006900179300001600248500000900264520176100273592002802034650001002062650001502072650001602087650001602103650001302119650002102132650001802153650001702171650001802188650001802206650001302224650001202237650001302249650001202262650002102274700002402295773014802319856009602467852000902563655001202572IND60668252420221122181354.0191125e195410  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066825242DNAL7 a10.2136/sssaj1954.03615995001800040018x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWear, John I.10aBoron Materials of Low Solubility and Their Use for Plant Growth  ap. 425-428.  aepub  aThree sources of boron including high-grade Fertilizer Borate, Colemanite and Howlite were compared as to their water-soluble boron contents, effect on plant growth and movement within the soil profile. Based on mill-run samples, the water-soluble boron in Fertilizer Borate was 5 times greater than in Colemanite and 25 times greater than in Howlite. Particle size had only a slight effect on the water-soluble boron recovered from Fertilizer Borate, but for Colemanite and Howlite the amount of water-soluble boron recovered was 6 to 8 times greater for finer than 80-mesh material as compared to coarser than 10-mesh material. This indicates the importance of particle size in controlling the rate of solubility of the more slowly soluble sources of boron. Although the water-soluble boron in Fertilizer Borate, Colemanite and Howlite was in the ratio of approximately 1:5:25, the boron contents and toxicity symptoms of turnips and soybeans grown in the greenhouse in Norfolk loamy sand indicated a requirement of about twice as much Colemanite as Fertilizer Borate and 2 to 3 times as much Howlite as Colemanite to produce the same degree of toxicity. Results of the field leaching study on Norfolk loamy sand indicate that high-grade Fertilizer Borate leached out of the topsoil very rapidly and collected in the lower zones of 8 to 16 and 16 to 24 inches. Twelve months later most of the water-soluble boron had been leached past the 2-foot depth. Howlite leached out of the topsoil slowly; the concentrations of water-soluble boron remained fairly constant for the 6 and the 12-month periods. Colemanite was found to be intermediate between the highly soluble sodium borate and the less soluble borosilicate from the standpoint of loss by leaching.  aPublisher supplied data 3aboron 3acolemanite 3afertilizers 3agreenhouses 3aleaching 3aloamy sand soils 3aparticle size 3aplant growth 3asodium borate 3asoil profiles 3asoybeans 3atopsoil 3atoxicity 3aturnips 3awater solubility1 aWilson, Clarence M.0 tSoil Science Society of America journal.g1954 Oct., v. 18, no. 4 p.425-428dSoil Science Society of AmericawJournal:jnl44580x0361-59957nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2136/sssaj1954.03615995001800040018x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03736naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002100148245019500169300001600364520168300380592002802063650002202091650001202113650001802125650001002143650001002153650001402163650001802177650001402195650001602209650001102225650001202236650001302248650002102261650003002282650000902312650003102321650001402352650003102366650001402397650002602411650001702437650003602454650001902490653002402509653007402533653001502607653004602622653003502668700001402703700001402717700001802731700001402749700001902763700005902782700001902841773014602860856008303006852000903089655001203098IND60614302320221116205245.0181015e20181012xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061430232DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbrc.2018.09.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, Tong-hyŏn,10aEffect of growth differentiation factor-15 secreted by human umbilical cord blood-derived mesenchymal stem cells on amyloid beta levels in in vitro and in vivo models of Alzheimer's disease  ap. 933-940.  aAlzheimer's disease (AD), which is the most common progressive neurodegenerative disease, causes learning and memory impairment. The pathological progress of AD can derive from imbalanced homeostasis of amyloid beta (Aβ) in the brain. In such cases, microglia play important roles in regulating the brain Aβ levels. In the present study, we found that human umbilical cord blood-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hUCB-MSCs) can increase, through paracrine action, the ability of microglial cells to clear Aβ. In order to identify the associated paracrine factors, a secretome of hUCB-MSCs co-cultured with Aβ-treated BV2 microglial cells was analyzed using a human cytokine protein array. As a result, growth differentiation factor-15 (GDF-15) was identified as a predominant candidate, and its association with Aβ clearance by microglial cells was investigated in vitro and in a 5XFAD mouse model. When Aβ-treated BV2 cells were treated with exogenous recombinant GDF-15, the Aβ levels in the culture medium decreased. Moreover, GDF-15 injection in the brain parenchyma of 5XFAD mice also led to decrease in Aβ plaques. In contrast, co-culture of BV2 cells and hUCB-MSCs treated with GDF-15-specific siRNA did not influence the Aβ levels in the culture medium. To elucidate how these phenomena are related, we confirmed that GDF-15 specifically increases insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE) expression in microglial cells through TGFβ receptor type II (TGFβRII), both in vitro and in vivo. These findings suggest that hUCB-MSCs promote the Aβ clearance ability of microglial cells through regulation of GDF-15 secretion, thus elucidating a therapeutic mechanism for AD.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAlzheimer disease 3aamyloid 3aanimal models 3ablood 3abrain 3acoculture 3aculture media 3acytokines 3ahomeostasis 3ahumans 3ainsulin 3alearning 3amemory disorders 3amesenchymal stromal cells 3amice 3aneurodegenerative diseases 3aneuroglia 3aparenchyma (animal tissue) 3asecretion 3asmall interfering RNA 3atherapeutics 3atransforming growth factor beta 3aumbilical cord 0aAlzheimer's disease 0aHuman umbilical cord blood derived-mesenchymal stem cells (hUCB-MSCs) 0aAmyloid-β 0aGrowth differentiation factor-15 (GDF-15) 0aInsulin-degrading enzyme (IDE)1 aLee, Dahm1 aLim, Hoon1 aChoi, Soo Jin1 aOh, Wonil1 aYang, Yoon Sun1 aChang, Jeong Ho1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2126-03171 aJeon, Hong Bae0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2018 Oct. 12, v. 504, no. 4 p.933-940dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl46848x0006-291X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2018.09.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02292naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001500148245013700163300001600300520095800316592002801274650002701302650001101329650001501340650004401355650001801399650001501417653004201432653002701474653004001501653003401541653003301575653002101608700002001629700001901649773014601668856008301814852000901897655001201906IND60614302420221116205159.0181127e20181002xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061430242DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbrc.2018.09.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKang, Jian10aATP enhances at low concentrations but dissolves at high concentrations liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) of ALS/FTD-causing FUS  ap. 545-551.  aATP is the universal energy currency but mysteriously its cellular concentration is much higher than that needed for providing energy. Recently ATP was decoded to act as a hydrotrope to dissolve liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) of FUS whose aggregation leads to ALS/FTD. By DIC microscopy and NMR, here we characterized the effect of ATP on LLPS of FUS and its N-/C-terminal domains. Very unexpectedly, we found that like nucleic acids, ATP enhances LLPS of FUS at low but dissolves at high concentrations. Intriguingly, ATP monotonically dissolves LLPS of NTD, while it induces LLPS of CTD at low but dissolves at high concentrations. Our study reveals for the first time that ATP can enhance LLPS most likely by behaving as a bivalent binder. Most importantly, our results imply that age-dependent reduction of ATP concentrations may not only result in decreasing its capacity in preventing protein aggregation, but also in enhancing aggregation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadenosine triphosphate 3aenergy 3amicroscopy 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3anucleic acids 3aseparation 0aLiquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) 0aFused in sarcoma (FUS) 0aAmyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) 0aFrontotemporal dementia (FTD) 0aAdenosine triphosphate (ATP) 0aNMR spectroscopy1 aLim, Liangzhong1 aSong, Jianxing0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2018 Oct. 02, v. 504, no. 2 p.545-551dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl46848x0006-291X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2018.09.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03374naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100003000166245016300196300001800359520173700377592002802114650002702142650001902169650001102188650001502199650001502214650001302229650002602242650002402268650002602292650001202318650000902330650002402339650002902363650001202392650001802404650001902422650001502441651001102456653003302467653001402500653002102514653001202535653001802547700002702565700003102592773013102623856008102754852000902835655001202844IND60651528320221120185207.0190711e201809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065152832DNAL7 a297453552pmid7 a10.1017/S13689800180010152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCândido, Naiara Abrantes10aEffectiveness of different interventions in public nurseries based on food and nutrition education: promoting breast-feeding and healthy complementary feeding  ap. 2454-2461.  aFood practices in the early years of life are important to form healthy eating habits; therefore, it is essential for the caregivers of infants to receive appropriate guidance.

Changes in professionals’ knowledge on the subject and alterations in parents’ beliefs, attitudes and intentions were assessed using questionnaires before and after the educational activities. Ten public nurseries in Nova Lima, Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais, Brazil, 2015. Ninety professionals (fifty in CG; forty in IG) and 169 parents (ninety-seven in CG; seventy-two in IG). After the intervention, there was a significant increase in the mean number of correct responses given by professionals in the IG (12·2 v. 10·7; P=0·001). In addition, there were improvements among the parents of the IG in relation to beliefs (soups and broths do not nourish my child: P=0·012), attitudes (offer meat from the sixth month: P=0·032) and intentions (do not offer soups and broths: P=0·003; offer vegetables: P=0·018; offer meat: P<0·001). Face-to-face nutritional intervention had a significantly greater effect on the parameters evaluated, indicating the importance of adequate guidance in childcare services to support the introduction of complementary feeding.  aPublisher supplied data 3aattitudes and opinions 3abreast feeding 3abroths 3acaregivers 3achild care 3achildren 3acomplementary feeding 3acomplementary foods 3ahealthy eating habits 3ainfants 3ameat 3anutrition education 3anutritional intervention 3aparents 3aprofessionals 3aquestionnaires 3avegetables 3aBrazil 0aFood and nutrition education 0aNurseries 0aInfant nutrition 0aWeaning 0aMixed feeding1 ade Sousa, Taciana Maia1 ados Santos, Luana Caroline0 tPublic health nutrition.g2018 Sept., v. 21, no. 13 p.2454-2461dCambridge University PresswJournal:jnl56775x1475-27277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S13689800180010153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02809naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245020900167300001600376520130200392592002801694650001801722650001901740650002601759650002101785650001601806650002001822650002101842650002901863650001201892650001801904650001201922650001601934650001701950650001301967650001901980650001101999700002202010700001902032700001602051700002102067700001902088773010602107856008202213990002302295852000902318655001202327IND60097749120221123004613.0141104e201209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009774912DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ejcb.2012.03.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPaschke, Peggy14aThe isoform B of the Dictyostelium long-chain fatty-acyl-coenzyme A synthetase is initially inserted into the ER and subsequently provides peroxisomes with an activity important for efficient phagocytosis  ap. 717-727.  aLong-chain fatty-acyl-coenzyme A synthetases activate fatty acids for anabolic or catabolic metabolism. They often localize to more than one organelle within eukaryotic cells. Dictyostelium contains two of these proteins, FcsA and FcsB with the latter being targeted to the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum by virtue of an N-terminal signal sequence and from there appears to move on to peroxisomes. Deletion of this signal favors the peripheral association of the protein with the mitochondrial surface instead. A strain lacking the activity of the FcsB enzyme was constructed by homologous recombination. It has a severe deficiency in the phagocytic uptake of particles, which can be partially alleviated by a peroxisomally targeted, soluble FcsA enzyme. It is, however, not rescued by expressing FcsA in the cytoplasm or targeting it to the ER, indicating that peroxisomal β-oxidation is important for phagocytosis. In a fcsA⁻/B⁻ double mutant phagocytosis efficiency is similar to fcsB⁻ cells. However, unlike the single mutants, the fcsA⁻/B⁻ strain is delayed in morphogenesis, but forms viable spores, albeit within a small fruiting body. This developmental defect is also seen in other mutants affecting peroxisomal enzymes involved in β-oxidation and the glyoxylate cycle.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDictyostelium 3abeta oxidation 3aendoplasmic reticulum 3aeukaryotic cells 3afatty acids 3afruiting bodies 3aglyoxylate cycle 3ahomologous recombination 3aligases 3amorphogenesis 3amutants 3aperoxisomes 3aphagocytosis 3aproteins 3asignal peptide 3aspores1 aPawolleck, Nadine1 aHaenel, Frauke1 aOtto, Heike1 aRühling, Harald1 aManiak, Markus0 tEuropean journal of cell biology.g2012 Sept., v. 91, no. 9 p.717-727dElsevier GmbHx0171-93357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ejcb.2012.03.0073Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03363naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245012300165520173200288592002802020650002102048650001402069650002002083650002302103650001902126650003102145650001002176650004302186650003402229650002802263650001502291650001302306650001102319650001902330650001402349650001702363650002102380650002202401650004302423650001802466650001202484653000902496653001302505653000902518653000902527653001002536700001902546700001602565700001502581700001202596773009802608856008202706852000902788655001202797IND60680609520221116175840.0200217e20200215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068060952DNAL7 a10.1016/j.lfs.2020.1172872doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Xiaoguang10aLncRNA TUG1 regulates proliferation and apoptosis by regulating miR-148b/IGF2 axis in ox-LDL-stimulated VSMC and HUVEC  aVascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) accumulation and endothelial cell dysfunction are associated with pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. Long noncoding RNA taurine up-regulated gene 1 (TUG1) has been reported to play an important role in cardiovascular diseases, including atherosclerosis. However, the regulatory mechanism underlying TUG1 in atherosclerosis is far from understood. VSMC and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) stimulated by oxidized low-density lipoprotein (ox-LDL) were used as cellular model of atherosclerosis. Cell proliferation and apoptosis were detected by CCK-8, flow cytometry and Western blot. The expression levels of TUG1, microRNA (miR)-148b and insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF2) were measured by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction or Western blot. The target association among TUG1, miR-148b and IGF2 was determined by luciferase reporter assay and RNA immunoprecipitation. The expression of TUG1 was increased in ox-LDL-treated VSMC and HUVEC. Silence of TUG1 inhibited proliferation and promoted apoptosis in ox-LDL-treated VSMC but induced proliferation promotion and apoptosis inhibition in HUVEC stimulated by ox-LDL. miR-148b was a target of TUG1 and its knockdown reversed the effect of TUG1 silence on proliferation and apoptosis of VSMC and HUVEC challenged by ox-LDL. IGF2 was a target of miR-148b and miR-148b regulated proliferation and apoptosis in ox-LDL-treated VSMC and HUVEC by targeting IGF2. TUG1 promoted IGF2 protein expression by sponging miR-148b. TUG1 knockdown attenuated ox-LDL-induced injury through regulating proliferation and apoptosis of VSMC and HUVEC by miR-148b/IGF2 axis, providing a novel mechanism for pathogenesis of atherosclerosis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aWestern blotting 3aapoptosis 3aatherosclerosis 3acell proliferation 3aflow cytometry 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3ahuman umbilical vein endothelial cells 3ainsulin-like growth factor II 3alow density lipoprotein 3aluciferase 3amicroRNA 3amodels 3anon-coding RNA 3aoxidation 3apathogenesis 3aprecipitin tests 3aprotein synthesis 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3asmooth muscle 3ataurine 0aTUG1 0amiR-148b 0aIGF2 0aVSMC 0aHUVEC1 aZheng, Xiaohui1 aCheng, Jing1 aZhang, Kai1 aMa, Cao0 tLife sciences.g2020 Feb. 15, v. 243 p.117287-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11720x0024-32057nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lfs.2020.1172873Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03158naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094024003500122040001800157100001900175245016800194300001800362520176100380592002802141650001302169650001202182650001602194650001602210650001002226650001702236650001502253650001902268650001202287650001002299650001002309650002302319653002202342653002602364653001302390653001102403700002702414700002002441700001902461773013002480856008102610852000902691655001202700IND60651528420221120185114.0190711e201808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065152842DNAL7 a29717681 297176812pmid7 a10.1017/S13689800180010762doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMahesh, Rewena10aRelative contributions of recommended food environment policies to improve population nutrition: results from a Delphi study with international food policy experts  ap. 2142-2148.  aTo determine weightings for the relative contributions of nineteen widely recommended good practice food environment policies to improve population nutrition, based on evidence of effectiveness and expert ratings, to facilitate benchmarking of the implementation of food environment policies globally. A two-round Delphi study was performed in 2015, whereby international food policy experts (n Rₒᵤₙd₁ 27, n Rₒᵤₙd₂ 21) compared effectiveness of all possible pairs of policy domains and good practice policies within domains to improve population nutrition according to the Saaty scale (1 to 9). Weightings for each domain and policy were derived from expert ratings based on the Analytic Hierarchy Process method. International. Food policy experts. Out of the seven policy domains, Food Prices and Food Promotion received the highest weightings for impact on improving population nutrition, while Food Trade received the lowest weighting. Among the nineteen specific policies, taxing unhealthy foods (3·8 (0·7)), healthy food provision in schools (2·8 (0·4)) and minimizing taxes on healthy foods (2·6 (0·4)) were given the highest weightings, while nutrient declarations on packaged foods (1·2 (0·2)) and healthy food policies in private-sector workplaces (1·0 (0·2)) received the lowest weightings (mean (95 % CI)). Expert-derived weightings on the relative contributions of recommended food environment policies to improve population nutrition will facilitate monitoring and benchmarking the implementation of these policies by governments among countries globally. Additional weightings for contributions of policies to reducing nutrition inequalities and improving consumer and child rights could be developed in the future.  aPublisher supplied data 3achildren 3aexperts 3afood policy 3afood prices 3afoods 3ahealthy diet 3amonitoring 3aprivate sector 3aschools 3ataxes 3atrade 3aworking conditions 0aFood environments 0aPolicy implementation 0aINFORMAS 0aDelphi1 aVandevijvere, Stefanie1 aDominick, Clare1 aSwinburn, Boyd0 tPublic health nutrition.g2018 Aug., v. 21, no. 11 p.2142-2148dCambridge University PresswJournal:jnl56775x1475-27277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S13689800180010763Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02398naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001500151245009200166300001600258520100300274592002801277650001101305650001101316650001301327650001301340650002201353650001301375650001101388650001701399653002401416653001001440653002401450653001601474653002301490700001501513700001601528700001501544700001901559700001501578700005601593700005601649773014101705856008501846852000901931655001201940IND60627064320221119093227.0190128e20181118xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062706432DNAL7 a10.1021/acssuschemeng.8b017822doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Weiqin10aIn Situ Synthesis of 1D Mesoporous MnO@C Nanorods for High Performance Li-Ion Batteries  ap. 139-146.  aTransition metal oxides have been regarded as the most potential anode material for lithium-ion batteries (LIBs), because of their high theoretical capacity, abundant resource, and low cost. Nevertheless, poor conductivity and large volumetric expansion during the charge–discharge processes make it difficult for LIBs application. In this work, we have adopted an in situ carbon coating method to synthesize 1D mesoporous MnO@C nanorods, which effectively work out the above problems of LIBs. Meanwhile, the MnO@C-3 (the mixture is 40 mL of H₂O in solvothermal reaction) anode exhibits excellent rate capability with the capacity retention of 90.3% at 2.0 A g–¹ and prominent cycling stability at 5.0 A g–¹ with the discharge capacity of 1210.1 mAh g–¹ after 400 cycles. When assembled to a full cell with commercial LiFePO₄ as cathode, the full cell represents 360.7 mAh g–¹ after 30 cycles (based on the anode), which displays a development potential for practical application.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanodes 3acarbon 3acathodes 3acoatings 3alithium batteries 3ananorods 3aoxides 3aporous media 0aLithium ion storage 0aMnO@C 0aMesoporous material 0a1D nanorods 0aSynergistic effect1 aAn, Cuihua1 aGuo, Huinan1 aSun, Junli1 aWang, Mengying1 aLi, Yunwei1 aJiao, Lifang1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4676-997X1 aWang, Yijing1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9584-54060 tACS sustainable chemistry & engineering.g2018 Nov. 18, v. 7, no. 1 p.139-146dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23317x2168-04857nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acssuschemeng.8b017823Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03063naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001400139245010600153300001800259520143100277592002801708650001601736650002801752650001301780650002301793650002201816650001301838650002101851650001401872650002001886650001901906650001801925650001701943650003301960650001601993653002702009653001102036653002002047653001402067653003002081653001902111700002302130700002702153700001902180700001402199700001502213700001702228700002102245700003602266773012302302856007502425852000902500655001202509IND60528201420170718000000.0160716e20140409xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052820142DNAL7 a10.1021/am500597t2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYao, Yuan10aNano- and Microstructures of Magnetic Field-Guided Maghemite Nanoparticles in Diblock Copolymer Films  ap. 5244-5254.  aThe control over the alignment of nanoparticles within a block copolymer matrix was investigated for different external magnetic fields with respect to producing well-aligned, highly oriented metal-oxide–polymer nanopatterns. Hybrid films were prepared by solution casting under a range of external magnetic fields. The nano- and microstructure of maghemite nanoparticles within poly(styrene-b-methyl methacrylate) diblock copolymer films as a function of the nanoparticle concentration was studied using optical microscopy, atomic force microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and grazing incidence small-angle X-ray scattering. Because of a polystyrene (PS) coating, the nanoparticles are incorporated in the PS domains of the diblock copolymer morphology. At higher nanoparticle concentrations, nanoparticle aggregates perturb the block copolymer structure and accumulate at the films surface into wire-shaped stripes. These wire-shaped nanoparticle aggregates form mainly because of the competition between nanoparticle–polymer friction and magnetic dipolar interaction. The magnetic behavior of the hybrid films was probed at different temperatures for two orthogonal directions (with the line-shaped particle aggregates parallel and perpendicular to the magnetic field). The hybrid film systems show superparamagnetic behavior and remarkable shape anisotropy that render them interesting for magnetic applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-radiation 3aatomic force microscopy 3acoatings 3acomposite polymers 3afilms (materials) 3afriction 3alight microscopy 3amaghemite 3amagnetic fields 3amicrostructure 3ananoparticles 3apolystyrenes 3ascanning electron microscopy 3atemperature 0amaghemite nanoparticle 0aGISAXS 0ablock copolymer 0athin film 0amagnetic shape anisotropy 0amagnetic wires1 aMetwalli, Ezzeldin1 aNiedermeier, Martin

Two strategies were examined for growing polystyrene chains onto graphite oxide (GO), stearylamine-modified GO (Stearyl-GO), and thermally reduced GO (TRGO): (i) chain transfer with novel thiol-functionalized graphenes and (ii) RAFT-mediated polymerization using dithiourethane-, dithioester- and dithiocarbonate-functionalized graphenes. Novel thiol-functionalized graphenes were obtained from FG either by esterification with 3-mercaptopropionic acid or by reaction with propylene sulfide. The styrene graft polymerization was initiated either with AIBN at 65 °C or by thermal styrene self-initiation at 130 °C. The graphene content, varying between 0 and 5.2 wt %, was determined by means of thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). Upon hydrolytic cleavage of the dithiocarbonate linker, the stability of the S-FG dispersion in polystyrene was lost, and the nonbonded S-FG was separated quantitatively from polystyrene by solvent extraction. During melt processing the graphene brushes self-assembled to produce nanoribbons and skeleton-like carbon superstructures, as determined by means of transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Both grafting effectiveness and superstructure formation were monitored by means of melt rheology.  aPublisher supplied data 3a3-mercaptopropionic acid 3aesterification 3afree radicals 3agraphene 3amelting 3ananocomposites 3apolymerization 3apolystyrenes 3apropylene 3arheology 3asolvents 3astyrene 3asulfides 3athermogravimetry 3atransmission electron microscopy1 aFriedrich, Christian1 aThomann, Ralf1 aMülhaupt, Rolf0 tMacromolecules.g2012 Sept. 11, v. 45, no. 17 p.7083-7090dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fma301379z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03131naa a2200709 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245016100166500001900327520125900346592002801605650001701633650002001650650001501670650000901685650001601694650001401710650002401724650001901748650001101767653002701778653001601805653003201821653001301853653001401866653000901880653001101889653000801900653000901908653000701917653001101924653000801935653000801943653000801951653000701959653000701966653000901973653000901982653000801991653000801999653000802007653000902015653000902024653000802033653000802041700001702049700001702066700001702083700001602100700001902116700005602135700001702191700001702208773009002225856008502315852000902400655001202409IND60740494920221120185308.0210723e20211001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074049492DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2021.1210702doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKong, Weibo10aProcessable and recyclable crosslinking solid-solid phase change materials based on dynamic disulfide covalent adaptable networks for thermal energy storage  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aGenerally, the chemically crosslinking solid-solid phase change materials (PCMs) are fabricated to address the issues of leakage and poor mechanical properties of traditional PCMs. However, the solid-solid PCMs also bring environmental pollution and resources waste as the permanent chemically crosslinking polymers cannot be recycled and reprocessed once molded. Herein, we reported a dynamic-covalent- crosslinking PCMs (V-PCMs) consisting of polyethylene glycol (PEG) as phase change ingredient, polyaryl polymethylene isocyanate (PAPI) as crosslinking points and disulfide as dynamic bonds. The as-prepared V-PCMs can reversibly store and release heat via melting and crystallization of PEG chains, and exhibit anti-leakage performance and solid-solid phase change merit due to chemically crosslinking networks even above melting point (Tₘ) of PEG. Besides, the V-PCMs show recycling and reprocessing ability from association mechanism of dynamic disulfide bonds. Also, the recycled V-PCMs can reversibly store and release heat and exhibit solid-solid phase change characteristic as original V-PCMs. This method provides a promising way for the fabrication of chemically crosslinking solid-solid PCMs with recyclability and multi-functionalization.  aPublisher supplied data 3acrosslinking 3acrystallization 3adisulfides 3aheat 3aingredients 3apollution 3apolyethylene glycol 3athermal energy 3awastes 0aPhase change materials 0aSolid-solid 0aCovalent adaptable networks 0aVitrimer 0aDisulfide 0aPCMs 0aSSPCMs 0aPEG 0aPAPI 0aTm 0aFSPCMs 0aTES 0aCAN 0aD-A 0aTd 0aTv 0aHEDS 0aFTIR 0aDMA 0aTGA 0aDSC 0aΔHm 0aΔHc 0aDMF 0aXRD1 aYang, Yunyun1 aYuan, Anqian1 aJiang, Liang1 aFu, Xiaowei1 aWang, Yuechuan1 aXu, Hualiang1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8235-16531 aLiu, Zhimeng1 aLei, Jingxin0 tEnergy.g2021 Oct. 01, v. 232 p.121070-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2021.1210703Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02595naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245009700166300001800263520163700281592002801918650001101946650002801957650001501985651001002000700006002010700001802070773012602088856008202214852000902296655001202305IND60631012420221119214125.0191122e201902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063101242DNAL7 a10.1007/s11269-018-2162-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDrissia, T.

For the study, the annual peak discharges of 43 gauging stations having length of data from 14 to 47 years spread over the Kerala State were used. Using L moments and L moment ratio, best fit distribution was identified among the five distributions; Generalised Extreme Value (GEV), Generalised Pareto Distribution (GPA), Generalised Logistic (GLO), Generalised Normal (LN3) and Pearson Type III (PE3) distribution for both at-site and regional flood frequency analysis. Chi-square test, ranking method using statistical indicators and L moment ratio diagram were used for identifying the best fit distribution for at-site flood frequency analysis. It was found that GPA was the best fit distribution for 27 stations, GLO for 14, LN3 for 1 station and GEV for 2 station. After discordancy test, five different homogeneous regions were identified through heterogeneity test to carry out the regional flood frequency analysis (RFFA). After identifying best-fit distributions for each zone, flood growth curves were derived by incorporating the catchment characteristics of the basins. The distribution that was best fit in case of at-site analysis for a gauging site is found to be entirely different than the best fit distribution resulted from RFFA. In RFFA, growth curves that provide the flood magnitude for various return periods can be used to estimate the flood magnitude and frequency at ungauged sites in each region of the Kerala State in India.  aPublisher supplied data 3abasins 3achi-square distribution 3awatersheds 3aIndia1 aJothiprakash, V.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0303-24681 aAnitha, A.

An environmental function analysis assessment of the Volturno River coastal zone (central Tyrrhenian Sea - Italy)  ap. 6.  aThis study allowed to identify several land-use conflicts in the Volturno River Coastal Zone area which extends for about 50 km2 on-land and seaward. The study area was analysed via Environmental Function Analysis involving assessment of specific environmental and socio-economic indicators. These were allocated scores from field surveys, interviews and extensive desktop studies, which included literature data and public territorial geo-databases. Normalised scores allowed production of a conservation/development matrix, enabling to evaluate the potential for conservation, development or conflict fields. The main conflicts were strictly related to urbanization, land reclamation and conservation of pristine areas with increasing anthropic pressure. The study site resulted to be in the conservation/development full conflict field of the matrix, signifying a tendency to high conflict rather than conservation as one might expect. This demonstrated that despite the strong attempt to preserve a pristine environment, the presence of different conflicts of use can hinder both the potential of development and the conservation of the area preventing either to take place. This important result leads to suggest that Environmental Function Analysis may be a potential tool for forthcoming adaptive management strategies in the study area.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadaptive management 3aanthropogenic activities 3acoasts 3ainterviews 3aland restoration 3aland use 3arivers 3asocioeconomics 3aspatial data 3asurveys 3aurbanization 3aItaly 3aTyrrhenian Sea1 aFerraro, Luciana0 tJournal of coastal conservation.g2020 Feb., v. 24, no. 1 p.6-6dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:J000000609x1400-03507nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11852-019-00717-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03411naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002000139245018200159300001800341520228000359592002802639650002302667650002602690650001302716650001202729650001602741700001502757700001502772700002202787700002002809700002002829700002202849773010602871856007502977852000903052655001203061IND60577750720221116140558.0170810e20120911xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057775072DNAL7 a10.1021/ma301453b2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMatsumiya, Yumi10aDielectric behavior of Styrene–Isoprene (SI) Diblock and SIIS Triblock Copolymers: Global Dynamics of I Blocks in Spherical and Cylindrical Domains Embedded in Glassy S Matrix  ap. 7050-7060.  aDielectric behavior was examined for nanodomain-forming styrene–isoprene (SI) diblock and SIIS triblock copolymers, the former having type-A dipoles aligned along its I block, whereas the latter being the head-to-head dimer of the former and having the dipoles inverted at the midpoint of the middle II block. The slow dielectric relaxation at low temperatures (<Tg,PS) detected the end motion (end-to-end fluctuation) of the I block of SI and/or the midpoint motion (midpoint-to-end fluctuation) of the II block of SIIS. This slow relaxation was found to be broader and retarded compared to bulk homopolyisoprene, mainly because of the osmotic constraint that forces the blocks to move highly cooperatively so as to keep the constant segment density in the nanodomain. Comparison of the dielectric mode distribution suggested that the effect of the osmotic constraint on the block dynamics is larger in the order of sphere (Sph) > cylinder (Cyl) > lamella (La). This order appears to naturally reflect the domain continuity that helps large-scale motion of the I block without violating the osmotic constraint. In the Sph and/or Cyl domains, all II blocks of the SIIS copolymer have their ends fixed on the surface of the same domain and are geometrically classified as loop-type blocks. These loop-type blocks are naively expected to behave similarly, in a dynamic sense, to the tail-type I blocks of SI. Nevertheless, comparison of the dielectric data of the SIIS and SI copolymers suggested that some of the II blocks are classified as dynamically pseudobridge-like blocks behaving differently from the tail-type I blocks. This behavior of the II blocks in the Sph/Cyl domains was speculated to reflect their end-to-end distance: This distance governs the direction of II block tension that acts on the midpoint of this block thereby affecting the dielectrically detected midpoint motion. The II block in the Sph/Cyl domain appears to exhibit the pseudobridge-like behavior when it has a large end-to-end distance and the two half-fragments of this block pull the midpoint in the opposite directions. This argument is crude but seems to be physically acceptable, as suggested from an approximate analysis of the distribution of the end-to-end distance in those domains.  aPublisher supplied data 3acomposite polymers 3adielectric properties 3aisoprene 3astyrene 3atemperature1 aChen, Quan1 aUno, Akiko1 aWatanabe, Hiroshi1 aTakano, Atsushi1 aMatsuoka, Kohei1 aMatsushita, Yushu0 tMacromolecules.g2012 Sept. 11, v. 45, no. 17 p.7050-7060dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fma301453b3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01951naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100004200140245010000182300002000282520074500302592002801047650002101075650001701096650002401113650002101137650002201158650001201180650002201192650001301214650003301227650001501260650002201275650002101297650001601318700002301334773012501357856007401482852000901556655001201565IND60666816320221116232035.0190919e20141106xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066681632DNAL7 a10.1039/c4ra08491h2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRājāc(Motion picture journalists),10aNatural, biodegradable and flexible egg shell membranes as separators for lithium-ion batteries  ap. 58546-58552.  aFlexible egg shell membranes (ESM) were obtained from chicken eggs after treatment with hydrochloric acid.

Animals undergo environmental, social and dietary changes leading to weaning stress syndrome. In order to compensate for the detrimental effects of weaning stress, antibiotics and natural extracts are used as feed additives, sometimes without fully understanding the interactions between them or even with low concentrations of mycotoxins that are frequently present in feed. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of fosfomycin (FOS), Cynara scolymus extract (CSE), deoxynivalenol (DON) and their combined administration on intestinal health of weaned piglets. The experiment was designed as a 2 × 2 × 2 factorial arrangement with 3 factors (FOS, CSE and DON treatments), 2 levels each (presence and absence) and 3 repeats. Weaned piglets (n = 24) were randomly divided in groups to receive the different treatments, namely DON administered in diet (50 μg/kg BW), FOS administered into the drinking water (30 mg/kg BW), CSE administered in diet (15 mg/kg BW) and all their combinations. After 15 d, the animals were euthanized and gastrointestinal tract samples were immediately taken to evaluate gastrointestinal pH, Enterobacteriaceae to lactic acid bacteria (E:L) ratio, volatile fatty acid (VFA) concentrations, disaccharidase (lactase, sucrase and maltase) activity, histology (intestinal absorptive area [IAA] and goblet cells count) and mucus ability to adhere pathogenic Escherichia coli. From our results, FOS and CSE treatments, individually or combined, produced a lower E:L ratio, an enhanced production of butyrate, increased disaccharidase activity (particularly maltase), and a greater IAA and goblet cells count along with an increase in pathogenic bacteria adherence to intestinal mucus. Deoxynivalenol did not show interactions with the other factors and its administration produced decreases on VFA, disaccharidase activity and goblet cells count. In conclusion, weaning piglets receiving diets containing FOS, CSE or both exhibited evident beneficial intestinal effects compared to animals receiving diets free from these compounds. On the contrary, the presence of DON at sub-toxic concentrations produced detrimental effects on intestinal health. The knowledge of the physiological and pathological gut changes produced by these compounds contributes to understand their potential productive consequences.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCynara cardunculus subsp. cardunculus 3aEscherichia coli 3aalpha-glucosidase 3aanimal nutrition 3abeta-galactosidase 3abutyrates 3adeoxynivalenol 3adiet 3adigestive tract 3afosfomycin 3ahistology 3aintestines 3alactic acid 3amucus 3apH 3asucrose alpha-glucosidase 3avolatile fatty acids 0aCynara scolymus extract 0aIntestinal health 0aWeaned piglets1 aDiéguez, Susana N.1 aFernández Paggi, María B.1 aRiccio, María B.1 aPérez Gaudio, Denisa S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2179-77601 aRodríguez, Edgardo1 aAmanto, Fabián A.1 aTapia, María O.1 aSoraci, Alejandro L.0 tAnimal nutrition.g2019 Dec., v. 5, no. 4 p.386-395dElsevier B.V.aChinese Association of Animal Science and Veterinary MedicinewJournal:23216x2405-63837nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aninu.2019.08.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02372naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002100148245011900169300001600288520112000304592002801424650002101452650002001473650001901493650001101512650001101523650002001534650001801554650002801572650001401600700002501614700001901639700002301658700002001681700002401701700001701725773010601742856008201848990002301930852000901953655001201962IND60097749620221120162213.0141104e201210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009774962DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ejcb.2012.06.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOuwehand, Krista10aCCL5 and CCL20 mediate immigration of Langerhans cells into the epidermis of full thickness human skin equivalents  ap. 765-773.  aEpidermal Langerhans cells (LC) play a key role in initiation and regulation of immune responses. Whereas LC migration out of the epidermis upon environmental assault is extensively studied, the mechanisms involved in the (re)population of the epidermis with LC are poorly understood. Here, we investigated the immigration of LC derived from the human MUTZ-3 cell line (MUTZ-LC) into the epidermis of a full thickness skin equivalent, comprising a fully differentiated epidermis on a fibroblast-populated dermis. MUTZ-LC were used to determine which epidermis-derived chemokines play a role in mediating LC trans-dermal migration into the epidermis. We found evidence for a role of keratinocyte-derived CCL5 and CCL20 in the chemo-attraction of MUTZ-LC. Neutralizing antibodies against CCL5 and CCL20 blocked LC migration towards keratinocytes. Secretion of these two chemokines was associated with incorporation of MUTZ-LC into the epidermis of full thickness skin equivalents. In conclusion, our findings suggest that epidermis derived CCL5 and CCL20 are pivotal mediators in recruitment of LC into the epidermis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLangerhans cells 3achemokine CCL20 3achemokine CCL5 3adermis 3ahumans 3aimmune response 3akeratinocytes 3aneutralizing antibodies 3asecretion1 aSpiekstra, Sander W.1 aWaaijman, Taco1 aBreetveld, Melanie1 aScheper, Rik J.1 ade Gruijl, Tanja D.1 aGibbs, Susan0 tEuropean journal of cell biology.g2012 Oct., v. 91, no. 10 p.765-773dElsevier GmbHx0171-93357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ejcb.2012.06.0043Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle04069naa a2200805 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245012900169300001800298520125100316592002801567650002301595650002301618650001101641650002201652650001601674653002401690653004001714653002101754653001701775653003201792653003201824653003201856653003201888653003201920653003201952653003201984653003202016653003202048653003202080653003202112653003202144653003202176653003202208653003202240653003202272653003202304653003202336653003202368653003202400653003202432653003202464653003202496653003202528653003202560653003202592653003202624653003202656653003202688653003202720653003202752653003202784653003202816653003202848653003202880653003202912653003202944700002702976700002303003700002903026700002503055773008103080856008103161852000903242655001203251IND60109593620221116153817.0161018e20130225xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010959362DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tet.2012.12.0552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKeiko, Natalia A.10a2-Alkoxy- and 2-alkylthio-2-alkenals in the reactions of electrophilic and nucleophilic addition.

The dependence of the CC bond length on the population ratio of its orbitals, P(πC2C3∗)/P(πC2C3), was used to evaluate the donor and acceptor effects of these substituents. The changes in energy values of the frontier orbitals showed that both the electrophilic and nucleophilic abilities of the molecules studied depended on their structure. The change of the polarization direction of the double bond (calculated as the difference of the natural charges formed on its atoms) under the effect of Cβ-substituent allows one to forecast the direction of the polar addition reactions for some representatives of 2-alkoxy- and 2-alkythiopropenals. The slightly different activation energies of hydration of 3-aryl(furyl)substituted 2-methoxypropenals for Markovnikov and Michael additions in acidic medium indicate to equal probability of these processes.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical reactions 3achemical structure 3aenergy 3aorganic compounds 3aprobability 0aSubstituted 2-enals 0aElectrophilic nucleophilic addition 0aDFT calculations 0aNBO analysis 0aKPNHONAEPLEAJL-YFHOEESVSA-N 0aBQXGNZGCDMOFOD-LFPVQMOXSA-N 0aCNYJGQMGWIWDQP-YQFADDPSSA-N 0aSKICHXFXNYBGLN-YVMONPNESA-N 0aPLVIKFLLDAPWCV-UHFFFAOYSA-N 0aKCZMUIDAZDTJFU-RZFWHQLPSA-N 0aBNBWSNNWJPEFDF-UHFFFAOYSA-N 0aBRQPADCHULIASH-UITAMQMPSA-N 0aIAGCPLACHCVCLK-UHFFFAOYSA-N 0aMBJWAAHRMKPORY-TWGQIWQCSA-N 0aBSUSILHSQFUMGQ-UITAMQMPSA-N 0aJIAWSHCICCAACH-DAXSKMNVSA-N 0aCQPCIYULEJPRPH-QISVCDMNSA-N 0aMGCJWIJAXYEDGK-YVMONPNESA-N 0aKCZMUIDAZDTJFU-RZFWHQLPSA-N 0aOVYBUEIIMGCOLH-YVMONPNESA-N 0aPGQMMHCXNMTTDH-POHAHGRESA-N 0aBNBWSNNWJPEFDF-UHFFFAOYSA-N 0aPWJCBWHJEWFUEU-DAXSKMNVSA-N 0aIAGCPLACHCVCLK-UHFFFAOYSA-N 0aBSUSILHSQFUMGQ-UITAMQMPSA-N 0aWCBXVMPXAPEFKK-YCBDHFTFSA-N 0aMGCJWIJAXYEDGK-YVMONPNESA-N 0aFAPYDWDQBGQYHR-UHFFFAOYSA-N 0aOVYBUEIIMGCOLH-YVMONPNESA-N 0aMSIDDALTHAVKRI-UHFFFAOYSA-N 0aPGQMMHCXNMTTDH-POHAHGRESA-N 0aKPNHONAEPLEAJL-YFHOEESVSA-N 0aPWJCBWHJEWFUEU-DAXSKMNVSA-N 0aCNYJGQMGWIWDQP-YQFADDPSSA-N 0aNWCRJJPCDJNTQJ-XQRVVYSFSA-N 0aSKICHXFXNYBGLN-YVMONPNESA-N 0aWCBXVMPXAPEFKK-YCBDHFTFSA-N 0aBRQPADCHULIASH-UITAMQMPSA-N 0aMBJWAAHRMKPORY-TWGQIWQCSA-N 0aMSIDDALTHAVKRI-UHFFFAOYSA-N 0aJIAWSHCICCAACH-DAXSKMNVSA-N1 aAksamentova, Tamara N.1 aChipanina, Nina N.1 aVerochkina, Ekaterina A.1 aVchislo, Nadezhda V.0 tTetrahedron.g2013 Feb. 25, v. 69 p.2022-2032dElsevier Ltdx0040-40207nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tet.2012.12.0553Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02093naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100001500188245006000203300001600263520093800279592002801217650001801245650001301263650001101276650001201287650001701299650001701316650001201333650001801345650002201363650002001385650001901405650001701424700002001441773010901461856008101570990002301651852000901674655001201683IND60110771820221119183812.0141109e201312  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011077182DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tem.2013.08.0052doi7 aPMC39095302pmcid7 a240639742pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChan, Owen10aInfluence of VMH fuel sensing on hypoglycemic responses  ap. 616-624.  aHypoglycemia produces complex neural and hormonal responses that restore glucose levels to normal. Glucose, metabolic substrates and their transporters, neuropeptides and neurotransmitters alter the firing rate of glucose-sensing neurons in the ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH); these monitor energy status and regulate the release of neurotransmitters that instigate a suitable counter-regulatory response. Under normal physiological conditions, these mechanisms maintain blood glucose concentrations within narrow margins. However, antecedent hypoglycemia and diabetes can lead to adaptations within the brain that impair counter-regulatory responses. Clearly, the mechanisms employed to detect and regulate the response to hypoglycemia, and the pathophysiology of defective counter-regulation in diabetes, are complex and need to be elucidated to permit the development of therapies that prevent or reduce the risk of hypoglycemia.  aPublisher supplied data 3ablood glucose 3adiabetes 3aenergy 3aglucose 3ahypoglycemia 3ahypothalamus 3aneurons 3aneuropeptides 3aneurotransmitters 3apathophysiology 3arisk reduction 3atransporters1 aSherwin, Robert0 tTrends in endocrinology & metabolism.g2013 Dec., v. 24, no. 12 p.616-624dElsevier Ltdx1043-27607nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tem.2013.08.0053Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02285naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245008900168300001600257520104400273592002801317650002301345650001901368650002301387650001201410650001301422650002101435650001201456650002101468650001801489650002101507650001301528650003301541650001301574700002201587700001301609700001601622700002201638700001401660773008401674856008401758852000901842655001201851IND60105976520221122044551.0141108e201202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010597652DNAL7 a10.1016/j.powtec.2011.10.0432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEisermann, C.10aPolymeric stabilization of fused corundum during nanogrinding in stirred media mills  ap. 315-324.  aThis paper deals with the steric stabilization of fused corundum during milling in ethanol and water. Different molecular weights of DAPRAL, a block copolymer with lyophilic and lyophobic side chains, were used to stabilize the feed material particles during wet grinding. Preliminary studies of the adsorbed amounts of the polymer in different solvents were determined by TGA and by rheology measurements in order to select sufficient amount of polymer to stabilize the suspension. The median particle size of sterically stabilized milled alumina particles was obtained via Dynamic Light Scattering, Ultrasonic Extinction, BET and SEM. In this investigation primary median particle sizes of 60nm were obtained in ethanol by applying the steric stabilization mechanism. The mechanochemical characterization was carried out on the milled alumina particles and a phase transformation from alumina to aluminum hydroxide in water was observed, irrespective of stabilization mechanisms. However, no phase transformation was observed in ethanol.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaluminum hydroxide 3aaluminum oxide 3acomposite polymers 3aethanol 3agrinding 3alight scattering 3amilling 3amolecular weight 3aparticle size 3aphase transition 3arheology 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asolvents1 aMallembakam, M.R.1 aDamm, C.1 aPeukert, W.1 aBreitung-Faes, S.1 aKwade, A.0 tPowder technology.g2012 Feb., v. 217 p.315-324dElsevier B.V.x0032-59107nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.powtec.2011.10.0433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02446naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245014200165300001600307520143500323592002801758650001501786650002601801650001001827650001501837650001101852650001601863650001301879700003301892773011601925856008202041852000902123655001202132IND60100852120221120163420.0141105e20121101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010085212DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcis.2012.07.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAjami, Elnaz10aFunctionalization of electropolished titanium surfaces with silane-based self-assembled monolayers and their application in drug delivery  ap. 258-267.  aThis work reports a novel and reproducible route for the successful modification of the surface of titanium (Ti) with self-assembled monolayers (SAMs). By electropolishing the surface of Ti, suitable physical/chemical surface properties were obtained for adequate growth of OctadecylTrichloroSilane (OTS) based SAM. Optimum conditions to achieve a well-organized and densely packed OTS film were also determined by monitoring the effect of different parameters including time, concentration, and temperature for OTS adsorption. The optimum conditions for the formation of an OTS–SAM were found to be upon immersion of the electropolished Ti substrate in a 10mM OTS solution at 10°C for 24h. Furthermore, multiple growth regimes for the formation of OTS–SAM on electropolished Ti surface were observed. The kinetics for the self-assembly were fast at the beginning of OTS adsorption, but rapidly slowed down after 10h of immersion, i.e. during the densification process of the film at the surface of Ti. In addition, the growth behavior was found to be random as opposed to the island growth behavior usually observed with OTS at the surface of silica. The successful implementation of OTS–SAM was further investigated through the immobilization and delivery of a model drug and the OTS monolayer showed clear abilities in drug delivery with an initial burst release up to 5days followed by a sustained release up to 26days.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3adrug delivery systems 3adrugs 3amonitoring 3asilica 3atemperature 3atitanium1 aAguey-Zinsou, Kondo-Francois0 tJournal of colloid and interface science.g2012 Nov. 1, v. 385, no. 1 p.258-267dElsevier Inc.x0021-97977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2012.07.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01701naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002500148245008700173300001600260520072600276592002801002650002601030650001501056650002101071650001301092650001101105700002001116700002301136700002601159773011101185856008201296852000901378655001201387IND60110688020221118062224.0141109e201211  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011068802DNAL7 a10.1016/j.trac.2012.06.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHasanzadeh, Mohammad10aMesoporous silica-based materials for use in electrochemical enzyme nanobiosensors  ap. 106-118.  aBiology and medicine have seen great advancements in the development of enzyme nanobiosensors capable of characterizing and quantifying biomolecules.

Higher carbon and hydrogen content in the ultimate analysis generates higher gaseous energy and exergy values, while results in lower energy and exergy efficiencies.

In a balanced order, participants walked at 35% VO2max for 45min (WALK) (29.0±1.9°C, 29.8±3.6% RH, no wind) in one test and in a separate test ran at 70% VO2max for 45min (RUN) (26.2±2.1°C, 31.1±7.0% RH, no wind). During both tests, participants wore a loose fitting 100% polyester long sleeve top and trouser ensemble with a low resistance to heat and vapour transfer (total thermal resistance of 0.154m2KW−1 and total water vapour resistance of 35.9m2PaW−1). wlocal, change from baseline in GSC (ΔGSC) and local thermal comfort were recorded every 5min. The results suggest that both wlocal and ΔGSC are strong predictors of thermal comfort during the WALK when sweat production is low and thermal discomfort minimal (r2>0.78 and r2>0.71, respectively). Interestingly, during the RUN wlocal plateaued at ~0.6 to 0.8 due to the high sweat production, whilst ΔGSC gradually increased throughout the experiment. ΔGSC had a similar relationship with thermal comfort to wlocal during the RUN (r2>0.95 and r2>0.94, respectively). Despite the strength of these relationships, the ability of wlocal to predict local thermal comfort accurately dramatically reduces in the exponential part of the curve. In a situation of uncompensated heat stress such as high metabolic rate in hot climate, where sweat production is high, ΔGSC shows to be a better predictor of local thermal comfort than wlocal. The wlocal data shows regional differences in the threshold which triggers local discomfort during the WALK than RUN; lower values are found for upper arms (0.22±0.03 and 0.28 ±0.22) and upper legs (0.22±0.11 and 0.22±0.10), higher values for upper back (0.30±0.12 and 0.36 ±0.10) and chest (0.27±0.10 and 0.39 ±0.32), respectively. However, no regional differences in the threshold of discomfort are found in the ∆GSC data. Instead, the data suggests that the degree of discomfort experienced appears to be related to the amount of sweat within and around the skin (as indirectly measured by ΔGSC) at each body site.  aPublisher supplied data 3achest 3aclimate 3aexercise 3aheat stress 3aheat tolerance 3alegs 3amales 3ametabolism 3apolyesters 3asweat 3awater vapor 3awind 0aw 0awlocal 0awbody 0aGSC 0a∆GSC 0aRegional 0aThermal discomfort 0aSkin wettedness 0aGalvanic skin conductance 0aClothing1 aRedortier, Bernard1 aVoelcker, Thomas1 aHavenith, George0 tJournal of thermal biology.g2013 Dec., v. 38, no. 8 p.530-538dElsevier LtdwJournal:12493x0306-45657nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jtherbio.2013.09.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03194naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100003100147245010600178300001400284520174700298592002802045650001002073650001902083650001802102650001902120650001502139650001502154650001002169650001602179650001102195650001702206650002402223650001602247650000902263650001502272650003102287650001402318650001302332650001502345700003202360700003002392700002902422700002902451700003602480773009402516856008102610852000902691655001202700IND60110376020221120161743.0141109e20120614xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011037602DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tox.2012.02.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShimada, Ana Lúcia Borges10aIn vivo hydroquinone exposure impairs MCP-1 secretion and monocyte recruitment into the inflamed lung  ap. 20-26.  aAlveolar macrophages (AMs) are important cells in the resolution of the inflammatory process and they come into direct contact with inhaled pollutants. Hydroquinone (HQ) is an environmental pollutant and a component of cigarette smoke that causes immunosuppressive effects. In the present work, we showed that mice exposed to low levels of aerosolized HQ (25ppm; 1h/day/5 days) presented impaired mononuclear cell migration to the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-inflamed lung. This may have been due to reduced monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) secretion into bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), and it was not related to alterations to mononuclear cell mobilization into the blood or adhesion molecules expression on mononuclear cell membranes. Corroborating the actions of HQ on MCP-1 secretion, reduced MCP-1 concentrations were also found in the supernatant of ex vivo AM and tracheal tissue collected from HQ-exposed mice. A direct action of HQ on MCP-1 secretion, resulting from impaired gene synthesis, was verified by in vitro incubation of naive AMs or tracheal tissue with HQ. The role of reduced levels of MCP-1 in the BALF on monocyte migration was analysed in the human monocytic lineage THP-1 in in vitro chemotaxis assays, which showed that the reduced concentrations of MCP-1 found in the BALF or cell supernatants from HQ-exposed mice impaired cell migration. Considering the fact that MCP-1 presents a broad spectrum of actions on pathophysiological conditions and that resident mononuclear cells are involved in lung tissue homeostasis and in immune host defence, the mechanism of HQ toxicity presented herein might be relevant to the genesis of infectious lung diseases in smokers and in inhabitants of polluted areas.  aPublisher supplied data 3ablood 3acell membranes 3acell movement 3achemokine CCL2 3achemotaxis 3acigarettes 3agenes 3ahomeostasis 3ahumans 3ahydroquinone 3alipopolysaccharides 3amacrophages 3amice 3apollutants 3arespiratory tract diseases 3asecretion 3atoxicity 3atoxicology1 aRibeiro, André Luiz Teroso1 aBolonheis, Simone Marques1 aFerraz-de-Paula, Viviane1 aHebeda, Cristina Bichels1 aFarsky, Sandra Helena Poliselli0 tToxicology.g2012 June 14, v. 296, no. 1-3 p.20-26dElsevier Ireland Ltdx0300-483X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tox.2012.02.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03194naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245011700166300001600283520174700299592002802046650001802074650001302092650002002105650001802125650002002143650001002163650001802173650000902191650003202200650001302232650002902245650002002274700002702294700002002321700001602341700002002357700002102377700002502398700002302423700001902446700002102465773011202486856008202598990002302680852000902703655001202712IND60110443920221119204902.0141109e20120415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011044392DNAL7 a10.1016/j.taap.2012.02.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYao, Cindy Q.10aInter-strain heterogeneity in rat hepatic transcriptomic responses to 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD)  ap. 135-145.  aThe biochemical and toxic effects of 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) have been the subject of intense study for decades. It is now clear that essentially all TCDD-induced toxicities are mediated by DNA–protein interactions involving the Aryl Hydrocarbon Receptor (AHR). Nevertheless, it remains unknown which AHR target genes cause TCDD toxicities. Several groups, including our own, have developed rodent model systems to probe these questions. mRNA expression profiling of these model systems has revealed significant inter-species heterogeneity in rodent hepatic responses to TCDD. It has remained unclear if this variability also exists within a species, amongst rodent strains. To resolve this question, we profiled the hepatic transcriptomic response to TCDD of diverse rat strains (L-E, H/W, F344 and Wistar rats) and two lines derived from L-E×H/W crosses, at consistent age, sex, and dosing (100μg/kg TCDD for 19h). Using this uniquely consistent dataset, we show that the majority of TCDD-induced alterations in mRNA abundance are strain/line-specific: only 11 genes were affected by TCDD across all strains, including well-known dioxin-responsive genes such as Cyp1a1 and Nqo1. Our analysis identified two novel universally dioxin-responsive genes as well as 4 genes induced by TCDD in dioxin-sensitive rats only. These 6 genes are strong candidates to explain TCDD-related toxicities, so we validated them using 152 animals in time-course (0 to 384h) and dose–response (0 to 3000μg/kg) experiments. This study reveals that different rat strains exhibit dramatic transcriptional heterogeneity in their hepatic responses to TCDD and that inter-strain comparisons can help identify candidate toxicity-related genes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal models 3acrossing 3adata collection 3adose response 3agene expression 3agenes 3amessenger RNA 3arats 3atetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin 3atoxicity 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranscriptomics1 aProkopec, Stephenie D.1 aWatson, John D.1 aPang, Renee1 aP'ng, Christine1 aChong, Lauren C.1 aHarding, Nicholas J.1 aPohjanvirta, Raimo1 aOkey, Allan B.1 aBoutros, Paul C.0 tToxicology and applied pharmacology.g2012 Apr. 15, v. 260, no. 2 p.135-145dElsevier Inc.x0041-008X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.taap.2012.02.0013Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01154naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245009100171300001800262520019800280592002800478650002300506650002300529650002300552650001900575700003100594700001900625700001800644773009700662856008400759852000900843655001200852IND60109983520221118023534.0141109e20120905xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010998352DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tetlet.2012.06.1262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNowrouzi, Najmeh10aAromatic nitration under neutral conditions using N-bromosuccinimide/silver(I) nitrate  ap. 4841-4842.  aThe use of N-bromosuccinimide and silver nitrate as a convenient reagent system for the nitration of aromatic compounds under neutral and environmentally safer reaction conditions is described.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaromatic compounds 3achemical reactions 3achemical structure 3asilver nitrate1 aMehranpour, Abdol Mohammad1 aBashiri, Elham1 aShayan, Zohre0 tTetrahedron letters.g2012 Sept. 5, v. 53, no. 36 p.4841-4842dElsevier Ltdx0040-40397nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tetlet.2012.06.1263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02362naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100003700147245018600184300001800370520034500388592002800733650001600761650002300777650002300800650002200823653005000845653003000895653002700925653000800952653001100960653003200971653003201003653003201035653003201067653003201099653003201131653003201163653003201195653003201227653003201259653003201291653003201323653003201355653003201387653003201419653003201451700003101483700002501514700002701539700001801566700002901584773008101613856008101694852000901775655001201784IND60109593820221116153743.0161018e20130304xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010959382DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tet.2013.01.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJaggavarapu, Satyanarayana Reddy10aFacile access to novel chromeno-2,6,9-trioxabicyclo[3.3.1]nonadienes via tandem nucleophilic substitution and [4+2] hetero Diels–Alder reaction: experimental and theoretical study  ap. 2142-2149.  aAn efficient synthesis of novel chromeno-2,6,9-trioxabicyclo-[3.3.1]nonadienes (CTOBN) scaffolds was achieved by mild base mediated reaction of 4-chloro-3-formylcoumarin and o-hydroxyacetophenones.

In HCCI engines, there is no direct control method for auto ignition time. A common way to indirectly control the ignition timing in HCCI combustion engines is varying engine’s parameters which can affect the combustion. In this work, a parametric study on natural gas HCCI combustion is conducted in order to identify the effect of inlet temperature and pressure, compression ratio, equivalence ratio and engine speed on combustion and engine performance parameters. In this paper, two kinds of parameters will be discussed. First, in-cylinder pressure diagrams and variation of start of combustion which are combustion parameters will be presented and then the second category, indicated mean effective pressure and thermal efficiency which are performance parameters will be studied. A six zone model coupled with detailed chemical kinetics code is used to simulate HCCI combustion. Both heat and mass transfer was considered in the modeling procedure. Results revealed that among the considered parameters, the equivalence ratio and inlet pressure are the most valuable parameters which can improve the combustion and performance characteristics of the HCCI engine.  aPublisher supplied data 3acombustion 3aheat 3amass transfer 3amodels 3anatural gas 3anitrogen oxides 3aparticulates 3areaction kinetics 3atemperature1 aKhoshbakhi Saray, R.1 aRahimi, Arash0 tFuel.g2011 Apr., v. 90, no. 4 p.1508-1514dElsevier Ltdx0016-23617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fuel.2010.12.0263Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02823naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094024002200130024001900152040001800171100002700189245007600216300001600292506007600308520146000384592002801844506003701872650001301909650001501922650001301937650003501950650000901985650002401994650001302018650001102031700002002042700001902062700002102081700001402102700002202116700002802138700002402166773009602190856008202286852000902368655001202377IND60110688220221207141727.0141109e201211  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011068822DNAL7 a10.1016/j.trac.2012.07.0132doi7 aPMC35009742pmcid7 a231755902pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPotyrailo, Radislav A.10aWireless sensors and sensor networks for homeland security applications  ap. 133-145.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aNew sensor technologies for homeland security applications must meet the key requirements of sensitivity to detect agents below risk levels, selectivity to provide minimal false-alarm rates, and response speed to operate in high throughput environments, such as airports, sea ports, and other public places. Chemical detection using existing sensor systems is facing a major challenge of selectivity. In this review, we provide a brief summary of chemical threats of homeland security importance; focus in detail on modern concepts in chemical sensing; examine the origins of the most significant unmet needs in existing chemical sensors; and, analyze opportunities, specific requirements, and challenges for wireless chemical sensors and wireless sensor networks (WSNs). We further review a new approach for selective chemical sensing that involves the combination of a sensing material that has different response mechanisms to different species of interest, with a transducer that has a multivariable signal-transduction ability. This new selective chemical-sensing approach was realized using an attractive ubiquitous platform of battery-free passive radio-frequency identification (RFID) tags adapted for chemical sensing. We illustrate the performance of RFID sensors developed in measurements of toxic industrial materials, humidity-independent detection of toxic vapors, and detection of chemical-agent simulants, explosives, and strong oxidizers.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aairports 3aexplosives 3aoxidants 3aradio frequency identification 3arisk 3asignal transduction 3atoxicity 3avapors1 aNagraj, Nandini1 aSurman, Cheryl1 aBoudries, Hacene1 aLai, Hanh1 aSlocik, Joseph M.1 aKelley-Loughnane, Nancy1 aNaik, R.q(Rajesh),0 tTrends in analytical chemistry.g2012 Nov., v. 40 p.133-145dElsevier B.V.x0165-99367nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.trac.2012.07.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02828naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002400148245012100172300001600293520141900309592002801728650002201756650003701778650002201815650001101837650001401848650002301862650003701885650001601922650000901938650001401947650001801961650002401979650003702003650001102040700002402051700002302075700002102098700002802119700002302147700002202170773008702192856008202279852000902361655001202370IND60100309220221121224714.0141105e201303  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010030922DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcat.2012.12.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBulushev, Dmitri A.10aVapour phase formic acid decomposition over PdAu/γ-Al₂O₃ catalysts: Effect of composition of metallic particles  ap. 171-180.  aA series of 1.8wt.% PdAu/γ-Al₂O₃ catalysts with a mean metal particle size of more than 10nm and different Pd/Au ratios were prepared by impregnation followed by hydrazine reduction and tested in the decomposition of vapour phase formic acid (2.2vol.%, 1bar) with and without added CO to the gas mixture. The catalytic activity was correlated with the bulk (AAS, XRD, EDS/TEM) and surface (XPS) composition of PdAu particles. A novel result was obtained that the surface composition of the particles did not change despite a considerable variation of the Au atomic fraction and it was found to be close to that of the Pd₂Au alloy. The activity of the Au/Al₂O₃ catalyst was negligible compared with that of the Pd/Al₂O₃ catalyst being a factor of 65 lower per gram of metal at 403K. The surface electronic properties (XPS) and the catalytic activity of the Pd₂Au layer calculated per one surface Pd atom (TOF) did not depend on the bulk composition of the metal particles. A lower activity of the Pd₂Au layer as compared with the pure Pd layer (2–3 times) was observed, but the activation energies for the Pd and PdAu catalysts were similar (40kJmol⁻¹) and were lower than that for the Au/Al₂O₃ catalyst (62kJmol⁻¹). Addition of CO led to a considerable inhibition of the reaction for all PdAu catalysts, this being accompanied by an increase in the activation energy to 69kJmol⁻¹.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aactivation energy 3aalloys 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3aenergy-dispersive X-ray analysis 3aformic acid 3agold 3ahydrazine 3aparticle size 3areaction inhibition 3atransmission electron microscopy 3avapors1 aBeloshapkin, Sergey1 aPlyusnin, Pavel E.1 aShubin, Yurii V.1 aBukhtiyarov, Valerii I.1 aKorenev, Sergey V.1 aRoss, Julian R.H.0 tJournal of catalysis.g2013 Mar., v. 299 p.171-180dElsevier Inc.x0021-95177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcat.2012.12.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03662naa a2200697 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001300153245013900166300001400305520176000319592002802079650001802107650002002125650001502145650001902160650001102179650001902190650002002209650002202229650001602251650001602267650001502283650001802298650001102316650002302327650001102350650001102361650001202372651001102384653002302395653001602418653002402434653001302458653001102471653001302482653001302495653001002508653001202518700001602530700001602546700001802562700001302580700001502593700001502608700001602623700001502639700001302654700001602667700001602683700001202699700002002711700001902731773010502750856008802855852000902943655001202952IND60111628620221119235606.0190319e20130710xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011162862DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2013.03.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Z.10aIncorporating weather sensitivity in inventory-based estimates of boreal forest productivity: A meta-analysis of process model results  ap. 25-35.  aWeather effects on forest productivity are not normally represented in inventory-based models for carbon accounting. To represent these effects, a meta-analysis was conducted on modeling results of five process models (ecosys, CN-CLASS, Can-IBIS, InTEC and TRIPLEX) as applied to a 6275ha boreal forest landscape in Eastern Canada. Process model results showed that higher air temperature (Ta) caused gains in CO2 uptake in spring, but losses in summer, both of which were corroborated by CO2 fluxes measured by eddy covariance (EC). Seasonal changes in simulated CO2 fluxes and resulting inter-annual variability in NEP corresponded to those derived from EC measurements. Simulated long-term changes in above-ground carbon (AGC) resulting from modeled NEP and disturbance responses were close to those estimated from inventory data. A meta-analysis of model results indicates a robust positive correlation between simulated annual NPP and mean maximum daily air temperature (Tamax) during May–June in four of the process models. We therefore, derived a function to impart climate sensitivity to inventory-based models of NPP: NPP′i=NPPi+9.5 (Tamax −16.5) where NPPi and NPP′i; are the current and temperature-adjusted NPP, 16.5 is the long-term mean Tamax during May–June, and Tamax is that for the current year. The sensitivity of net CO2 exchange to Ta is nonlinear. Although, caution should be exercised while extrapolating this algorithm to regions beyond the conditions studied in this landscape, results of our study are scalable to other regions with a humid continental boreal climate dominated by black spruce. Collectively, such regions comprise one of the largest climatic zones in the 450Mha North American boreal forest ecosystems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPicea mariana 3aair temperature 3aalgorithms 3aboreal forests 3acarbon 3acarbon dioxide 3aeddy covariance 3aforest ecosystems 3ahumid zones 3ainventories 3alandscapes 3ameta-analysis 3amodels 3aseasonal variation 3aspring 3asummer 3aweather 3aCanada 0aEcosystem modeling 0aCarbon flux 0aForest productivity 0aCBM-CFS3 0aEcosys 0aCan-IBIS 0aCN-CLASS 0aInTEC 0aTRIPLEX1 aGrant, R.F.1 aArain, M.A.1 aBernier, P.Y.1 aChen, B.1 aChen, J.M.1 aGovind, A.1 aGuindon, L.1 aKurz, W.A.1 aPeng, C.1 aPrice, D.T.1 aStinson, G.1 aSun, J.1 aTrofymowe, J.A.1 aYeluripati, J.0 tEcological modelling.g2013 July 10, v. 260 p.25-35dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl6191x0304-38007nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2013.03.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02047naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001400148245010000162300001800262520076500280592002801045650002201073650001301095650001201108650001401120650002301134650002601157650001201183650001501195650003301210650001201243650001601255700001501271700001201286700001901298700001701317700001701334700001301351700001701364700001601381773007801397856008201475990002301557852000901580655001201589IND60102652620221122203534.0141106e201104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010265262DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fuel.2010.11.0272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Heng10aSynthesis of Mo/IM-5 catalyst and its catalytic behavior in methane non-oxidative aromatization  ap. 1515-1521.  aA Mo-modified catalyst, Mo-IM-5, was prepared for the non-oxidative aromatization of methane, and for comparison, Mo-ZSM-5 was also synthesized for the same reaction. The physical properties and acidities of the samples were characterized by XRD, SEM, BET and IR spectroscopy. Compared with Mo-ZSM-5, the Mo-IM-5 catalyst showed both a higher methane conversion and higher benzene selectivity. In addition, Mo-IM-5 was slightly more stable than Mo-ZSM-5. The catalytic behavior of Mo-IM-5 may be attributed to its unusual two-dimensional 10-member-ring channel system with the character of three-dimensional cavity. Furthermore, the effects of different Si/Al ratios, Mo loadings and temperatures on the catalytic performance of Mo-IM-5 were also investigated.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3aaluminum 3abenzene 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3ainfrared spectroscopy 3amethane 3amolybdenum 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asilicon 3atemperature1 aWu, Shujie1 aGuo, Ye1 aShang, Fanpeng1 aYu, Xiaofang1 aMa, Yuanyuan1 aXu, Chen1 aGuan, Jingqi1 aKan, Qiubin0 tFuel.g2011 Apr., v. 90, no. 4 p.1515-1521dElsevier Ltdx0016-23617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fuel.2010.11.0273Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02390naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002100148245011300169300001600282520133200298592002801630650001901658650001501677650001901692650001701711650001501728650001301743650001801756650001601774650001001790700002601800700001801826773007001844856008201914990002301996852000902019655001202028IND60102806220221117070915.0141106e201303  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010280622DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fuel.2012.09.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNilsson, Susanna10aGasification of char from dried sewage sludge in fluidized bed: Reaction rate in mixtures of CO₂ and H₂O  ap. 764-768.  aThe rate of gasification of char from dried sewage sludge (DSS) with a gas containing CO₂ and H₂O was studied. The tests were conducted in an atmospheric laboratory fluidized bed (FB), using CO₂–H₂O–N₂ mixtures as fluidizing gas and temperatures in the range of 800–900°C. The gasification rates were compared with those previously obtained for DSS char using one single reactant (either CO₂ or H₂O) in the gas, i.e. in mixtures of CO₂ and N₂ or H₂O and N₂. It was found that the char gasification rates measured in a mixture containing both reactants, i.e. CO₂ and H₂O, were well approximated as the sum of the individual rates measured separately with CO₂ and H₂O. Besides this result, an alternative method to accurately measure the char gasification in an FB using CO₂–H₂O–N₂ mixtures was employed, based on determining the char remaining in the reactor up to a certain time of gasification from the CO and CO₂ concentrations in the gas during the combustion of this char. It was shown that this method compares well with the traditional method (based on tracking the CO and CO₂ concentrations during gasification) when using a single reactant, but improves significantly the reliability of measurements for tests where both H₂O and CO₂ react simultaneously with char.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon dioxide 3acombustion 3afluidized beds 3agasification 3amonitoring 3anitrogen 3asewage sludge 3atemperature 3awater1 aGómez-Barea, Alberto1 aOllero, Pedro0 tFuel.g2013 Mar., v. 105 p.764-768dElsevier Ltdx0016-23617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fuel.2012.09.0083Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02467naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004700094040001800141100002000159245012800179300001600307520100600323592002801329650002001357650001901377650001401396650002301410650001301433650003801446650002301484650000901507650002101516650001901537650004401556650002101600650001901621650002701640650003401667650003301701650001601734700001801750700001401768700002001782773010501802856009301907852000902000655001202009IND60105895620221123023058.0141108e201302  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010589562DNAL7 a10.1016/j.polymdegradstab.2012.11.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMaiti, Sonakshi10aBiodegradation behaviour of PMMA/cellulose nanocomposites prepared by in-situ polymerization and ex-situ dispersion methods  ap. 635-642.  aMicro/nano crystalline (MCC) cellulose particles were prepared from jute fibre by acid hydrolysis route.

However, recent studies that explicitly combine data from systems and structural biological approaches are having a profound effect on our ability to predict how mutations and small molecules affect atomic-level mechanisms, disrupt systems-level networks, and ultimately lead to changes in organismal fitness. In fact, we argue that a shared framework for analysis of nonadditive genetic and thermodynamic responses to perturbations will accelerate the integration of reductionist and global approaches. A stronger bridge between these two areas will allow for a deeper and more-complete understanding of complex biological phenomenon and ultimately provide needed breakthroughs in biomedical research.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abiomedical research 3adata collection 3amutation 3athermodynamics1 aGross, John D.1 aKrogan, Nevan J.,0 tMolecular cell.g2013 Jan. 24, v. 49 p.222-231dElsevier Inc.x1097-27657nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.molcel.2013.01.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01819naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094024002200134024001900156040001800175100001800193245007500211300001800286520077800304592002801082650002001110650002501130650001101155650002201166650000801188651001001196700001901206700002401225773010201249856008601351990002301437852000901460655001201469IND60101616920221118023754.0141106e201312  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010161692DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhealeco.2013.10.0022doi7 aPMC38805772pmcid7 a241894502pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBaeten, Steef10aRising inequalities in income and health in China: Who is left behind?  ap. 1214-1229.  aIn recent decades, China has experienced double-digit economic growth rates and rising inequality. This paper implements a new decomposition approach using the China Health and Nutrition Survey (1991–2006) to examine the extent to which changes in level and distribution of incomes and in income mobility are related to health disparities between rich and poor. We find that health disparities in China relate to rising income inequality and in particular to the adverse health and income experience of older (wo)men, but not to the growth rate of average incomes over the last decades. These findings suggest that replacement incomes and pensions at older ages may be one of the most important policy levers for reducing health disparities between rich and poor Chinese.  aPublisher supplied data 3adietary surveys 3aeconomic development 3aincome 3aissues and policy 3amen 3aChina1 aVan Ourti, Tom1 avan Doorslaer, Eddy0 tJournal of health economics.g2013 Dec., v. 32, no. 6 p.1214-1229dElsevier B.V.x0167-62967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhealeco.2013.10.0023Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02720naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001300147245013100160300001400291520142400305592002801729650001101757650001301768650002101781650002001802650001501822650003101837650000901868650001301877650001801890650001801908650001601926650001101942650001701953700001601970700001801986700001302004700001602017700001902033700001202052773008502064856008102149990002302230852000902253655001202262IND60108733320221123045024.0141108e201305  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010873332DNAL7 a10.1016/j.snb.2013.01.0422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Meng10aUltrasensitive electrochemiluminescence immunosensor based on nanoporous gold electrode and Ru-AuNPs/graphene as signal labels  ap. 50-56.  aIn the paper, a simple and sensitive sandwich-type electrochemiluminescence (ECL) immunosensor was proposed for the detection of cancer antigen 125 (CA 125) on a nanoporous gold (NPG) modified glassy carbon electrode (GCE). The NPG was easily prepared by a selective dissolution of silver from silver/gold alloy in nitric acid. The fabrication of Ru(bpy)₃ ²⁺-gold nanoparticles (Ru-AuNPs) aggregates was owing to the electrostatic interactions between citrate-capped AuNPs and Ru in aqueous medium. The Ru-AuNPs composite assembled with poly(diallyldimethylammonium chloride) functionalized graphene nanosheets (GR) (Ru-AuNPs/GR) was used as ECL labels, which has large surface area, good biocompatibility and electronic conductivity. The ECL intensity observed by the application of as-prepared Ru-AuNPs/GR composites was enhanced 6-fold compared to those of Ru-AuNPs. The primary antibody of CA 125 (Ab₁) was first immobilized on the NPG modified electrode, then the antigen and the secondary antibody (Ab₂) were conjugated to form a sandwich-type immunocomplex through the specific interaction. The proposed ECL immunosensor provided a wide linear response range over 0.01–100UmL⁻¹ with a detection limit of 0.005UmL⁻¹. The ECL immunosensor showed high sensitivity, good reproducibility, satisfied regeneration and selectivity, and may exhibit an attractive approach for other analyte determination.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalloys 3aantigens 3abiocompatibility 3adetection limit 3aelectrodes 3aelectrostatic interactions 3agold 3agraphene 3aimmunosensors 3ananoparticles 3anitric acid 3asilver 3asurface area1 aZhang, Meng1 aGe, Shenguang1 aYan, Mei1 aYu, Jinghua1 aHuang, Jiadong1 aLiu, Su0 tSensors and actuators.g2013 May, v. 181 p.50-56dElsevier B.V.x0925-40057nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.snb.2013.01.0423Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03213naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001700149245010100166300001400267520165900281592002801940650001401968650001601982650001101998650001402009650002302023650001102046650001202057650003502069650001602104650001702120650001002137650001202147650001602159650000902175650002402184650002202208650002002230650001202250650001902262700002402281700001502305700002702320700001702347700002002364700002402384700002202408773012602430856008302556990002302639852000902662655001202671IND60107354320221118012652.0141108e201208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010735432DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jsbmb.2011.11.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFester, Lars10aEstrogen-regulated synaptogenesis in the hippocampus: Sexual dimorphism in vivo but not in vitro  ap. 24-29.  aHippocampal neurons are capable of synthesizing estradiol de novo. Estradiol synthesis can be suppressed by aromatase inhibitors and by knock-down of steroid acute regulatory protein (StAR), whereas elevated levels of substrates of steroidogenesis enhance estradiol synthesis. In rat hippocampal cultures, the expression of estrogen receptors (ERs) and synaptic proteins, as well as synapse density, correlated positively with aromatase activity, regardless of whether the cultures originated from males or females. All effects induced by the inhibition of aromatase activity were rescued by application of estradiol to the cultures. In vivo, however, systemic application of letrozole, an aromatase inhibitor, induced synapse loss in female rats, but not in males. Furthermore, in the female hippocampus, density of spines and spine synapses varied with the estrus cycle. In addressing this in vivo–in vitro discrepancy, we found that gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) regulated estradiol synthesis via an aromatase-mediated mechanism and consistently regulated spine synapse density and the expression of synaptic proteins. Along these lines, GnRH receptor density was higher in the hippocampus than in the cortex and hypothalamus, and estrus cyclicity of spinogenesis was found in the hippocampus, but not in the cortex. Since GnRH receptor expression also varies with the estrus cycle, the sexual dimorphism in estrogen-regulated spine synapse density in the hippocampus very likely results from differences in the GnRH responsiveness of the male and the female hippocampus.

The selected sequences are generally further used in the form of synthetic peptides; however, as such, their affinity for the selecting antibody is extremely variable and factors influencing this affinity have not been fully deciphered. We have used an f88.4 phageâdisplayed peptide library to identify ligands of mAb 11E12, an antibody reactive to human cardiac troponin I. A majority of the sequences thus selected showed a (T/A/I/L) EP(K/R/H) motif, homologous to the YâTEPH motif identified by multiple peptide synthesis as the critical motif recognized by mAb 11E12 in the peptide epitope. A set of 15âmer synthetic peptides derived from the phageâselected sequences was used in BIACORE to characterize their interaction with mAb 11E12. Most peptides exhibited affinities in the 7â26ânm range. These affinities represented, however, only 1.9â7.5% of the affinity of the 15âmer peptide epitope. In circular dichroism experiments, the peptide epitope showed a propensity to have some stabilized conformation, whereas a lowâaffinity peptide selected by phageâdisplay did not. To try to decipher the molecular basis of this difference in affinity, new peptides were prepared by grafting the Nâ or the Câterminal sequence of the peptide epitope to the YâTEPK motif of a lowâaffinity peptide selected by phageâdisplay. These hybrid peptides showed marked increases both in affinity (as assessed using BIACORE) and in inhibitory potency (as assessed in competition ELISA), compared with the parent sequence. Thus, the sequences flanking the motif, although not containing critical residues, convey some determinants necessary for high affinity. The affinity of a given peptide strongly depends on its capacity to maintain the antigenically reactive structure it has on the phage, implying that it is impossible to predict whether highâ or lowâaffinity peptides will be obtained from phage display.  aPublisher supplied data 3aInovirus 3abacteriophages 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3aepitopes 3ahumans 3ahybrids 3amonoclonal antibodies 3apeptide libraries 3asynthetic peptides1 aVillard, Sylvie1 aPugniÃ¨re, Martine1 aMani, JeanâClaude1 aNavarroâTeulon, Isabelle1 aRharbaoui, FaÃ¯za1 aLaune, Daniel1 aLoret, Erwann1 aPau, Bernard1 aGranier, Claude0 tEuropean journal of biochemistry.g2000 Mar., v. 267, no. 6 p.1819-1829dBlackwell Science Ltdx0014-29567nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1432-1327.2000.01184.x  aDNAL 7aarticle03063naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001700155245009000172300001400262520182300276592002802099650003302127650002202160650002002182650002302202650001002225650002002235650001902255650001102274650002102285650001302306700001902319700002302338700002802361700002302389700002602412773009402438856008902532990002302621852000902644655001202653IND60107751120221120043212.0141108e201307  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010775112DNAL7 a10.1016/j.radphyschem.2013.03.0312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNunes, Inês10aBioburden assessment and gamma radiation inactivation patterns in parchment documents  ap. 82-89.  aParchment documents are part of our cultural heritage and, as historical artifacts that they are, should be preserved. The aim of this study was to validate an appropriate methodology to characterize the bioburden of parchment documents, and to assess the growth and gamma radiation inactivation patterns of the microbiota present in that material. Another goal was to estimate the minimum gamma radiation dose (Dₘᵢₙ) to be applied for the decontamination of parchment as an alternative treatment to the current toxic chemical and non-chemical decontamination methods. Two bioburden assessment methodologies were evaluated: the Swab Method (SM) and the Destructive Method (DM). The recovery efficiency of each method was estimated by artificial contamination, using a Cladosporium cladosporioides spore suspension. The parchment samples' microbiota was typified using morphological methods and the fungal isolates were identified by ITS-DNA sequencing. The inactivation pattern was assessed using the DM after exposure to different gamma radiation doses, and using C. cladosporioides as reference. Based on the applied methodology, parchment samples presented bioburden values lower than 5×10³CFU/cm² for total microbiota, and lower than 10CFU/cm² for fungal propagules. The results suggest no evident inactivation trend for the natural parchment microbiota, especially regarding the fungal community. A minimum gamma radiation dose (Dₘᵢₙ) of 5kGy is proposed for the decontamination treatment of parchment. Determining the minimal decontamination dose in parchment is essential for a correct application of gamma radiation as an alternative decontamination treatment for this type of documents avoiding the toxicity and the degradation promoted by the traditional chemical and non-chemical treatments.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCladosporium cladosporioides 3acultural heritage 3adecontamination 3afungal communities 3afungi 3agamma radiation 3amicrobial load 3aspores 3atoxic substances 3atoxicity1 aMesquita, Nuno1 aCabo Verde, Sandra1 aCarolino, Maria Manuela1 aPortugal, António1 aBotelho, Maria Luísa0 tRadiation physics and chemistry.g2013 July, v. 88 p.82-89dElsevier Ltdx0969-806X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.radphyschem.2013.03.0313Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01174naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002500150245007900175300001800254520025000272592002800522650002300550650002300573650001000596650001600606700001800622700002200640700002000662773009700682856008400779852000900863655001200872IND60109743920221119052907.0141109e20110420xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010974392DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tetlet.2011.02.0602doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStevens, Benjamin D.10aSynthesis of two novel regioisomeric oxospiropyrazole piperidine scaffolds  ap. 1949-1951.  aThe synthesis of two unprecedented regioisomeric oxospiropyrazole piperidine scaffolds is detailed.

The NSE-SWNTs not only enhanced electrochemical signal but also presented abundant antigen domains for competitive immunological recognition to anti-NSE primary antibody and then gold nanoprobes labeled with alkaline phosphatase conjugated secondary antibody (AP-anti-IgG/AuNPs). The AP-anti-IgG/AuNPs exhibited highly catalytic activity toward enzyme substrate and significantly amplified the amperometric signal for target molecule detection. Based on the dual signal amplification of SWNTs and gold nanoprobe, the immunosensor could response down to 0.033ngmL⁻¹ NSE with a linear range from 0.1ngmL⁻¹ to 2μgmL⁻¹, and showed acceptable precision and reproducibility. The designed immunosensor was amenable to direct quantification of target protein with a wide range of concentration in complex clinical serum specimens. The assay results were in a good agreement with the reference values. The proposed electrochemical immunosensor provided a pragmatic platform for convenient detection of tumor markers in clinical diagnosis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalkaline phosphatase 3aantibodies 3aantigens 3ablood serum 3acarbon nanotubes 3acatalytic activity 3aelectrochemistry 3aenzyme substrates 3aglassy carbon electrode 3agold 3aimmunosensors 3aneurons 3anormal values 3aphosphopyruvate hydratase1 aCheng, Wei1 aLi, Qing1 aLuo, Caihui1 aYan, Li1 aZhang, Decai1 aYin, Yibing1 aDing, Shijia1 aJu, Huangxian0 tTalanta.g2012 May 15, v. 93 p.433-438dElsevier B.V.x0039-91407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.talanta.2012.02.0473Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02716naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245015700126300001800283520166600301592002801967650001601995650002102011650001402032650001202046650002402058650002502082650001902107650000902126650001402135650001602149650001102165650002602176700002102202700002302223773009902246852000902345655001202354IND4489561520221121001941.0120501e201111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448956152DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLal, Shruti10aRegulation of the SQUAMOSA PROMOTER-BINDING PROTEIN-LIKE genes/microRNA156 Module by the Homeodomain Proteins PENNYWISE and POUND-FOOLISH in Arabidopsis  ap. 1123-1132.  aThe morphology of inflorescences is regulated in part by the temporal and spatial events that regulate flower specification. In Arabidopsis, an endogenous flowering time pathway mediated by a subset of SQUAMOSA PROMOTER-BINDING PROTEIN-LIKE (SPL) transcription factors, including SPL3, SPL4, and SPL5, function to specify flowers by activating floral meristem identity genes. During shoot development, SPL3, SPL4, and SPL5 are post-transcriptionally regulated by microRNA156 (miR156). The photoperiod regulated florigenic signal, FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT), promotes floral induction, in part by activating SPL3, SPL4, and SPL5. In turn, these SPLs function in parallel with FT to specify flower meristems. Two related BELL1-like homeobox genes PENNYWISE (PNY) and POUND-FOOLISH (PNF) expressed in the shoot apical meristem are absolutely required for the specification of floral meristems. Genetic studies show that the floral specification function of FT depends upon PNY and PNF; however, the interplay between these homeodomain proteins and SPLs is not known. In this manuscript, we show that the photoperiodic floral induction of SPL3, SPL4, and SPL5 is dependent upon PNY and PNF. Further, PNY and PNF also control SPL3, SPL4, and SPL5 expression by negatively regulating miR156. Lastly, ectopic expression of SPL4 partially rescues the pny pnf non-flower-producing phenotype, while overexpression of SPL3 or SPL5 in pny pnf plants was unable to restore flower specification. These results suggest that: (1) SPL3, SPL4, and SPL5 function is dependent upon PNY and PNF, or (2) expression of multiple SPLs is required for floral specification in pny pnf plants.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArabidopsis 3aapical meristems 3aflowering 3aflowers 3agene overexpression 3ahomeodomain proteins 3ahomeotic genes 3aloci 3aphenotype 3aphotoperiod 3ashoots 3atranscription factors1 aPacis, Leo Bryan1 aSmith, Harley M.S.0 tMolecular plant.g2011 Nov., v. 4, no. 6 p.1123-1132dOxford University Pressx1752-98597nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle02182naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245011800171300001600289520088800305592002801193650001401221650003901235650001101274650002601285650001401311650001501325650001601340700002701356700003601383700004301419700003901462700002801501700001801529700002801547700003201575773008301607856008501690852000901775655001201784IND60109117320221122221010.0141109e20110715xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010911732DNAL7 a10.1016/j.talanta.2011.04.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMeira, Marilena10aDetermination of the oxidation stability of biodiesel and oils by spectrofluorimetry and multivariate calibration  ap. 430-434.  aOxidation stability is an important quality parameter for biodiesel.

With increasing sintering temperature from 350 to 750°C, the feet and cross of T-ZnO became gradually shorter and bigger, respectively. And subsequently tetrahedron-shaped ZnO nanoparticles were produced instead of T-ZnO at 850°C. The morphological evolution was explained by a new physical model involving Thomson effect, leading to a decrease in the specific surface area. In addition, the contact between feet got better and then became poorer. Meanwhile, surface defects of T-ZnO were also altered: zinc interstitial (Znᵢ ••) was decreased in its amount while oxygen vacancy (VO ×) showed an inverse trend as sintering temperature increased. Moreover, the best gas-sensing performance toward formaldehyde and methanol was obtained after sintering at 450°C. This was mainly attributed to the synergetic effect between the best grain contact (meaning that more T-ZnO can make contributions to the sensor response) and more zinc interstitial as well as larger specific surface area (supplying more chemisorbed oxygen). Our work could offer important guidance for the process selection and material design to develop nanostructure-based sensors.  aPublisher supplied data 3afeet 3aformaldehyde 3amethanol 3amicrostructure 3ananoparticles 3aoxygen 3asurface area 3atemperature 3azinc 3azinc oxide1 aZeng, Dawen1 aPeng, Xuelian1 aZhang, Shunping1 aXie, Changsheng0 tSensors and actuators.g2013 May, v. 181 p.509-517dElsevier B.V.x0925-40057nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.snb.2013.02.0123Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03429naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001500155245011500170300001400285520225200299592002802551650001602579650001502595650001202610650000902622650001902631650001102650650001302661650001302674650001802687650001302705650001302718650001702731700001902748700001802767700001902785773009402804856008902898990002302987852000903010655001203019IND60107751320221120043121.0141108e201307  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010775132DNAL7 a10.1016/j.radphyschem.2013.03.0192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTu, Shu-Ju10aQuantitative dosimetric assessment for effect of gold nanoparticles as contrast media on radiotherapy planning  ap. 14-20.  aIn CT planning for radiation therapy, patients may be asked to have a medical procedure of contrast agent (CA) administration as required by their physicians. CA media improve quality of CT images and assist radiation oncologists in delineation of the target or organs with accuracy. However, dosimetric discrepancy may occur between scenarios in which CA media are present in CT planning and absent in treatment delivery. In recent preclinical experiments of small animals, gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) have been identified as an excellent contrast material of x-ray imaging. In this work, we quantitatively evaluate the effect of AuNPs to be used as a potential material of contrast enhancement in radiotherapy planning with an analytical phantom and clinical case. Conray 60, an iodine-based product for contrast enhancement in clinical uses, is included as a comparison. Other additional variables such as different concentrations of CA media, radiation delivery techniques and dose calculation algorithms are included. We consider 1-field AP, 4-field box, 7-field intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) and a recent technique of volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT). CA media of AuNPs (Conray 60) with concentrations of 10%, 20%, 30%, 40% and 50% containing 28.2, 56.4, 84.6, 112.8 and 141.0mg of gold (iodine) per mL were prepared prior to CT scanning. A virtual phantom with a target where nanoparticle media are loaded and clinical case of gastric lymphoma in which the Conray 60 media were given to the patient prior to the CT planning are included for the study. Compared to Conray 60 media with concentration of 10%/50%, Hounsfield units for AuNP media of 10%/50% are 322/1608 higher due to the fact that atomic number of Au (Z=79) is larger than I (Z=53). In consequence, dosimetric discrepancy of AuNPs is magnified between presence and absence of contrast media. It was found in the phantom study that percent dose differences between presence and absence of CA media may be reduced by delivery techniques of 7-field IMRT or VMAT. To manage less than 3% of percent dose difference, it was suggested an upper limit of 15% (or 42.3mg Au/mL) of AuNP media in the phantom study; 8% (or 22.5mg Au/mL) in the specific clinical case.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-radiation 3aalgorithms 3aanimals 3agold 3aimage analysis 3aiodine 3alymphoma 3ananogold 3ananoparticles 3apatients 3aplanning 3aradiotherapy1 aYang, Pei-Ying1 aHong, Ji-Hong1 aLo, Ching-Jung0 tRadiation physics and chemistry.g2013 July, v. 88 p.14-20dElsevier Ltdx0969-806X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.radphyschem.2013.03.0193Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01937naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245007600168300001600244520091200260592002801172650002301200650002301223650001601246650001301262650002101275650002001296650001801316700001701334700002101351700002001372773011601392856008201508852000901590655001201599IND60100659820221120231114.0141105e20110301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010065982DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcis.2010.11.0492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStocco, Antonio10aDynamics of amphiphilic diblock copolymers at the air–water interface  ap. 172-178.  aTwo polyisoprene–polyethyleneoxide diblock copolymers with different block length ratios adsorbed to the water surface were investigated by multiple angle of incidence ellipsometry, evanescent wave light scattering, and surface tension experiments. In a semidilute interfacial regime, the transition from a two-dimensional to a “mushroom” regime, in which polymer chains form loops and tails in the subphase, was discussed. A diffusion mechanism parallel to the interface was probed by evanescent wave dynamic light scattering. At intermediate concentrations, the interfacial diffusion coefficient D∥ scales with the surface concentration Γ, as D∥∼Γ⁰.⁷⁷ in agreement with the scaling observed for polymer solutions in a semidilute regime. At relatively high concentrations a decreasing of D∥ is discussed in terms of increasing friction due to interactions between polyisoprene chains.  aPublisher supplied data 3aangle of incidence 3acomposite polymers 3adiffusivity 3afriction 3alight scattering 3asurface tension 3asurface water1 aTauer, Klaus1 aPispas, Stergios1 aSigel, Reinhard0 tJournal of colloid and interface science.g2011 Mar. 1, v. 355, no. 1 p.172-178dElsevier Inc.x0021-97977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2010.11.0493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01470naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245006500169300001800234520054900252592002800801650001500829650002300844650002200867650002000889650000900909700001700918700002000935700002400955773008700979856008101066852000901147655001201156IND60109350520221119220908.0141109e20110304xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010935052DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tet.2011.01.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKurashina, Yusuke10aStereoselective synthesis of malyngic acid and fulgidic acid  ap. 1649-1653.  aA new stereoselective total synthesis of malyngic acid has been achieved from a known oxazolidinone derivative via eight steps involving the Evans asymmetric alkylation as the chirality-inducing step and chelation-controlled Zn(BH₄)₂ reduction of an α-hydroxy ketone intermediate for the installation of the 12,13-anti stereochemistry.

The silicon and aluminium oxides needed for the geopolymerization process were produced by the carbonation of hydrated Portland cement, which transforms CSH and CAH (Portland cement hydrates) into silica and alumina gels. Hydrated-carbonated Portland cement was alkali activated with a NaOH/waterglass solution. Pastes and mortars were prepared, and micro-structural and mechanical properties were analyzed. It has been noted that geopolymers are mechanically stable and yield compressive strength higher than 10MPa when mortars are cured at 65°C for 3days. The results have shown that there are interesting possibilities for re-using the cement-rich fraction of construction and demolition waste. Alkaline activation of hydrated-carbonated Portland cement could be considered a low CO₂-emission binder.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaluminum 3aaluminum oxide 3acarbonation 3acement 3agels 3amechanical properties 3apastes 3araw materials 3asilica 3asilicon 3asodium hydroxide 3awastes1 aBorrachero, M.V.1 aMonzó, J.1 aSoriano, L.1 aTashima, M.M.0 tMaterials letters.g2012 May 1, v. 74 p.223-225dElsevier B.V.x0167-577X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.matlet.2012.01.1323Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03158naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003700113040001800150100002500168245010400193300001600297520157400313592002801887650001601915650001701931650002801948650001301976650001701989650001302006650001702019650001502036650006002051650001002111650002102121650005102142650001102193650003802204650001102242650001402253650002602267650000902293650001402302650001702316651002502333700002202358700002202380700001802402773009302420856008302513990002302596852000902619655001202628IND60102563520221118231313.0141106e201108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010256352DNAL7 a213927852pmid7 a10.1016/j.jpeds.2011.01.0382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuardamagna, Ornella10aLipoprotein(a) and Family History of Cardiovascular Disease in Children with Familial Dyslipidemias  ap. 314-319.  aOBJECTIVE: To investigate in children and adolescents with familial dyslipidemias the association between lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] level and family history of cardiovascular disease (CVD), and whether this association is independent of the disturbed lipid profile. STUDY DESIGN: Lp(a) level, lipid profile, and a 2-generation genealogic tree to detect cardiovascular events were evaluated in 231 patients with familial dyslipidemias. Lp(a) levels were stratified according to presence, age of occurrence, and number and type of cardiovascular events in the patient’s kindreds. RESULTS: Lp(a) and other plasma lipid fractions did not differ between patients with and those without a family history of cardiovascular events. However, the percentage of patients with elevated Lp(a) level (≥85th percentile) was higher in those with a positive family history for early cardiovascular events (P = .01). Lp(a) level was a significant independent predictor of the number of premature cardiovascular events (β = 0.17; P = .01) and of cerebrovascular events in kindreds (OR, 2.5; 95% CI, 1.05-6.03; P = .039), independent of plasma lipid fractions and other cardiovascular risk factors. CONCLUSIONS: In children and adolescents with familial dyslipidemias, the overall association between Lp(a) level and family history of early CVD may be due to a threshold effect in those with the highest Lp(a) levels. However, multiple cardiovascular events and cerebrovascular events are predicted by any increase in plasma Lp(a) level, independent of other cardiovascular risk factors.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadolescents 3ablood lipids 3acardiovascular diseases 3achildren 3alipoproteins 3apatients 3arisk factors 2aAdolescent 2aCardiovascular Diseasesxbloodxepidemiologyxetiology. 2aChild 2aChild, Preschool 2aDyslipidemiasxbloodxcomplicationsxgenetics. 2aFemale 2aGenetic Predisposition to Disease 2aHumans 2aIncidence 2aLipoprotein(a)xblood 2aMale 2aPrognosis 2aRisk Factors 0aItalyxepidemiology.1 aAbello, Francesca1 aAnfossi, Giovanni1 aPirro, Matteo0 tJournal of pediatrics.g2011 Aug., v. 159, no. 2 p.314-319dMosby, Inc.x0022-34767nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jpeds.2011.01.0383Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01948naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002400150245007800174300001600252520088500268592002801153650001501181650002101196650001301217650001501230650001001245650001301255650001301268650001601281650001701297650001101314700002101325700001901346773009301365856008401458990002301542852000901565655001201574IND60103663120221118083202.0141106e20110331xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010366312DNAL7 a10.1016/j.matlet.2011.01.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVũ, Đình Hiếu,10aHumidity control porous ceramics prepared from waste and porous materials  ap. 940-943.  aThis study investigated the feasibility of generating humidity control porous ceramics by sintering a mixture of volcanic ash, weathered volcanic ash, and waste glass.

In addition, recent studies have shown that inflammation, probably mediated by macrophages, mediates the pathogenesis associated to high levels of homocysteine (Hcy). In the present study, we evaluated the Hcy effects in the ATP hydrolysis and its breakdown products in murine macrophages. The results showed that micromolar concentrations of Hcy increased the ATP, ADP and AMP hydrolysis. Additionally, our results show decreased inosine levels in the extracellular milieu of Hcy-exposed macrophages. The increasing in ATP, ADP and AMP hydrolysis are not explained by increased transcription or protein expression of NTPDases and ecto-5′-nucleotidase (ecto-5′-NT/CD73) enzymes. Moreover, the formation of reactive oxygen species did not interfere in the Hcy effects, which suggest that Hcy or Hcy metabolites act directly on the modulation of NTPDases and ecto-5′-NT/CD73 activities. In conclusion, Hcy induces the rapid breakdown of ATP, ADP and AMP to adenosine (ADO), which is classically known as an anti-inflammatory response in immune cells. However, by the action of these enzymes, the extracellular adenosine generated during Hcy treatment probably is uptaken into the cells, as evidenced by the decreased in inosine formation, and thus collaborating to the inflammatory complications associates to HHcy  aPublisher supplied data 3aadenosine 3aadenosine diphosphate 3aadenosine monophosphate 3aadenosine triphosphate 3aanti-inflammatory activity 3acoronary artery disease 3aenzymes 3ahomocysteine 3ahydrolysis 3aimmune response 3ainflammation 3amacrophages 3ametabolites 3amice 3apathogenesis 3aprotein synthesis 3areactive oxygen species 3athrombosis1 aBergamin, Letícia Scussel1 aBraganhol, Elizandra1 aSévigny, Jean1 ade Souza Wyse, Angela Terezinha1 aBattastini, Ana Maria Oliveira0 tToxicology in vitro.g2013 Dec., v. 27, no. 8 p.2273-2278dElsevier Ltdx0887-23337nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tiv.2013.09.0013Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02082naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002300152245011200175300001800287520085900305592002801164650001701192650001401209650002101223650002001244650002201264650001201286650001101298650001001309700002501319700002201344700001801366700002201384700002001406700001801426700002301444773008701467856008601554990002301640852000901663655001201672IND60109035420221116142859.0141109e20111211xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010903542DNAL7 a10.1016/j.steroids.2011.07.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBasini, Giuseppina10aHypoxia stimulates the production of the angiogenesis inhibitor 2-methoxyestradiol by swine granulosa cells  ap. 1433-1436.  aWe previously demonstrated the presence of 2-methoxyestradiol (2-ME) in swine follicular fluid. Present study was aimed first of all to investigate if swine granulosa cell produce 2-ME; in addition, we tried to assess a potential effect of hypoxia in modulating 2-ME output. Finally, we explored the effect of 2-ME in an angiogenesis bioassay set up in our lab. Our data show that cultured granulosa cells are able to produce 2-ME; interestingly, the secretion of the hormone appeared to be stimulated by hypoxia. Angiogenesis bioassay points out that 2-ME displays an inhibitory effect on neovascularisation. Therefore our data suggest that 2-ME could be a local effector in determining the fine tuning responsible for follicle angiogenesis. These data deserve special attention since the ovary is a valuable experimental model in angiogenesis research.  aPublisher supplied data 3aangiogenesis 3abioassays 3afollicular fluid 3agranulosa cells 3ahormone secretion 3ahypoxia 3amodels 3aswine1 aGrasselli, Francesca1 aBussolati, Simona1 aBaioni, Laura1 aBianchi, Federica1 aMusci, Marilena1 aCareri, Maria1 aMangia, Alessandro0 tSteroids.g2011 Dec. 11, v. 76, no. 13 p.1433-1436dElsevier Inc.x0039-128X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.steroids.2011.07.0123Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01657naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245007200163300001400235520074700249592002800996650002501024650002101049650002601070700001401096700001301110700001901123773010001142856008101242990002301323852000901346655001201355IND60108484620221117181709.0141108e20131215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010848462DNAL7 a10.1016/j.sna.2013.10.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMalatek, M.10aImprovement of the off-diagonal magnetoimpedance sensor white noise  ap. 20-24.  aThis work deals with the analysis of noise sources of the off-diagonal magneto-impedance sensor with stress-annealed amorphous ribbon. This experimental analysis shows that the equivalent magnetic noise spectral density is mostly due to the electronic conditioning circuitry that operates the sensor. The electronic noise was then reduced with employment of an improved excitation-detection technique for our sensor and an equivalent magnetic noise spectral density below 1pT/Hz in white noise region has been reached. Indeed, the equivalent magnetic white noise level of the output signal decreased from 5pT/Hz to 560fT/Hz. Nevertheless, this noise level is still limited by the electronic conditioning, leaving room for further improvement.  aPublisher supplied data 3aelectrical equipment 3aequipment design 3aequipment performance1 aDufay, B.1 aSaez, S.1 aDolabdjian, C.0 tSensors & Actuators: A.

The carbon nanotubes are dispersed uniformly on the whole MHCs. The conversion mechanism of the crack-free nacre/carbonate nanotube composite coatings (NCCs) to MHCs is a dissolution-precipitation reaction. After soaking in PBS, calcium ions are released from the nacre powders and react with phosphate ions to form carbonated hydroxyapatite nanoparticles. These nanoparticles aggregate to form mesopores with the pore sizes of ~3.9nm among them. Simulated body fluid (SBF) immersion tests reveal that MHCs have a good in vitro bioactivity.  aPublisher supplied data 3acalcium 3acarbon nanotubes 3acoatings 3aelectrophoresis 3ahydroxyapatite 3aions 3airradiation 3ananoparticles 3apowders 3asoaking1 aYao, Yong-bo1 aNing, Cong-Qin1 aChu, Lian-Feng1 aGuo, Ya-Jun0 tMaterials letters.g2011 Mar. 31, v. 65, no. 6 p.1007-1009dElsevier B.V.x0167-577X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.matlet.2010.12.0363Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01409naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245008600168300001800254520045600272592002800728650002100756650002500777650001800802650002300820650002300843650001400866650001200880700002600892773008700918856008101005852000901086655001201095IND60109350620221119221003.0141109e20110304xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010935062DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tet.2010.12.0662doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLahmann, Martina10aTransformations of chromanol and tocopherol and synthesis of ascorbate conjugates  ap. 1654-1664.  aα-Tocopherol and as a model compound pentamethylchromanol could be transferred into simple and more complex 5a-ether derivatives including galactopyranose as well as ascorbic acid conjugates.

CdSe quantum dots (QDs) were assembled on the TiO₂ films as a sensitizer to improve the light harvesting efficiency in visible light, because the TiO₂ absorbs only UV light. As the concentration of TiCl₄ solution to 200mM was increased, the surface coverage of anatase TiO₂ nanoparticles and the loading of CdSe QDs also increased. Furthermore, the anatase TiO₂ between the rutile TOMR and the CdSe QD facilitates the charge separation, which suppresses the charge recombination. Due to these beneficial effects, the photoelectrochemical performance was significantly enhanced with the increased TiCl₄ concentration.  aPublisher supplied data 3ananoparticles 3aquantum dots 3atitanium dioxide 3aultraviolet radiation1 aJung, Sung-Woo1 aKyung Yang, Si1 aAhn, Kwang-Soon1 aHyung Kang, Soon0 tMaterials letters.g2013 Nov. 15, v. 111 p.47-50dElsevier B.V.x0167-577X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.matlet.2013.08.0543Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02955naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004700094040001800141100002200159245014100181300001600322520156500338592002801903650001001931650002501941650001901966650001501985650002102000650001702021650001502038650001302053650001902066650001802085650001102103650001302114650000902127650001002136650002402146700002502170700002502195700002102220700002402241700002502265773010502290856009302395852000902488655001202497IND60105896220221123035313.0141108e201302  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010589622DNAL7 a10.1016/j.polymdegradstab.2012.10.0222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCandelier, Kévin10aComparison of chemical composition and decay durability of heat treated wood cured under different inert atmospheres: Nitrogen or vacuum  ap. 677-681.  aWood heat treatment is an attractive alternative to improve decay resistance of low natural durability wood species. Nowadays, several types of thermal treatments of wood exist. These treatments differ mainly by the nature of the inert atmosphere used to avoid wood combustion which may correspond to: nitrogen, vacuum, steam or oil. Decay resistance is strongly correlated to thermal degradation of wood cells wall components and consequently of treatment conditions from which depend chemical modifications. The aim of this study is to determine the effect of a new generation of treatment performed under vacuum on the chemical modifications occurring during treatment. For this purpose, one hardwood (beech) has been treated under different conditions (vacuum, nitrogen, steam). All treatments were performed at 220 °C for mass losses resulting from wood thermodegradation of approximately 12%. For each treatment condition extractives, Klason lignin, hemicelluloses and α-celluloses content were determined as well as monosaccharide composition. Intensity of thermodegradation was also evaluated by TD-GC-MS. Results show that extracts content were lower in the case of wood samples treated under vacuum, while lignin, hemicelluloses and α-celluloses contents were higher in the case of samples treated under steam and nitrogen, indicating lower wood degradation under vacuum treatment. These results were confirmed by chromatography analyses according to the nature and quantity of thermodegradation volatile products formed during TD-GC-MS analyses.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFagus 3achemical composition 3achromatography 3acombustion 3adecay resistance 3adecayed wood 3adurability 3ahardwood 3aheat treatment 3ahemicellulose 3alignin 3anitrogen 3aoils 3asteam 3athermal degradation1 aDumarçay, Stéphane1 aPétrissans, Anélie1 aDesharnais, Lyne1 aGérardin, Philippe1 aPétrissans, Mathieu0 tPolymer degradation and stability.g2013 Feb., v. 98, no. 2 p.677-681dElsevier Ltdx0141-39107nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.polymdegradstab.2012.10.0223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01951naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245007200166300001600238520105900254592002801313650001301341650001101354650001501365650002701380700001601407700001301423773010001436856008101536990002301617852000901640655001201649IND60108414820221119092145.0141108e201209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010841482DNAL7 a10.1016/j.sna.2012.07.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYuan, Shenfang12aA miniaturized composite impact monitor and its evaluation research  ap. 182-192.  aFrom the Prognostic and Health Management (PHM) standpoint, the main purpose of the structural health monitoring is to help the maintenance of aircraft structures. Here, aiming at on-line applications, this paper puts forward a new digital impact localization method. Different from traditional processing methods, the new one is achieved in a digital way by turning the outputs of PZT sensors directly into digital queues and localizing the impact occurring area based on the digital queues obtained. Depending on this method, a PZT sensor array based impact monitor with advantages of miniaturized size, low weight and low energy consumption is developed which can meet the strict on-line application requests. Details of the new impact monitor design are presented in this paper. Meanwhile, a series of experiments, including evaluations on complex composite structures, have been conducted to verify the performance of the new digital impact monitor. This new monitor shows its potential for on-line structural PHM applications on aerospace vehicles.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaircraft 3aenergy 3amonitoring 3atraditional technology1 aLiu, Peipei1 aQiu, Lei0 tSensors & Actuators: A.

The maturation and drying of the gel under different conditions led to different behavior regarding the loading and release of TC from these matrices. The pore size modifications upon TC loading evidenced by BET method show different ability of the glass matrices with respect to TC incorporation, also supported by experimental EPR and fluorescence spectroscopy. EPR spectra of both TC solution and immobilized TC on the porous structure of glass specimens demonstrated changes in tetracycline structure during loading and upon adsorption. The TC release profile monitored by differential pulse voltammetry shows a maximum concentration after 2h and a continuously slow release during the next 24h. The obtained results demonstrate that the pores size modification related to different maturation and drying procedures seems to be a determinative factor in tetracycline release process.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3abioactive properties 3adrying 3afluorescence emission spectroscopy 3agels 3aglass 3atetracycline1 aBanica, F.1 aGruian, C.1 aVanea, E.1 aGoller, G.1 aSimon, V.0 tJournal of molecular structure.g2013 May 22, v. 1040 p.47-52dElsevier B.V.x0022-28607nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.molstruc.2013.02.0163Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle04249naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094024002200131024001900153040001800172100001400190245004300204300001400247520275700261592002803018650003203046650001903078650001503097650001203112650002703124650002203151650001403173650002303187650001203210650001303222650003503235650002403270650001003294650000903304650001103313650001703324650002003341650001703361650001703378650002203395650001103417650003103428700001903459773012603478856008303604990002303687852000903710655001203719IND60107354720221118012749.0141108e201208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010735472DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jsbmb.2012.01.0082doi7 aPMC34747072pmcid7 a223267322pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKuo, John10aNeurosteroids, trigger of the LH surge  ap. 57-65.  aRecent experiments from our laboratory are consistent with the idea that hypothalamic astrocytes are critical components of the central nervous system (CNS) mediated estrogen positive feedback mechanism. The “astrocrine hypothesis” maintains that ovarian estradiol rapidly increases free cytoplasmic calcium concentrations ([Ca²⁺]ᵢ) that facilitate progesterone synthesis in astrocytes. This hypothalamic neuroprogesterone along with the elevated estrogen from the ovaries allows for the surge release of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) that triggers the pituitary luteinizing hormone (LH) surge. A narrow range of estradiol stimulated progesterone production supports an “off-on-off” mechanism regulating the transition from estrogen negative feedback to estrogen positive feedback, and back again. The rapidity of the [Ca²⁺]ᵢ response and progesterone synthesis support a non-genomic, membrane-initiated signaling mechanism. In hypothalamic astrocytes, membrane-associated estrogen receptors (mERs) signal through transactivation of the metabotropic glutamate receptor type 1a (mGluR1a), implying that astrocytic function is influenced by surrounding glutamatergic nerve terminals. Although other putative mERs, such as mERβ, STX-activated mER-Gαq, and G protein-coupled receptor 30 (GPR30), are present and participate in membrane-mediated signaling, their influence in reproduction is still obscure since female reproduction be it estrogen positive feedback or lordosis behavior requires mERα. The astrocrine hypothesis is also consistent with the well-known sexual dimorphism of estrogen positive feedback. In rodents, only post-pubertal females exhibit this positive feedback. Hypothalamic astrocytes cultured from females, but not males, responded to estradiol by increasing progesterone synthesis. Estrogen autoregulates its own signaling by regulating levels of mERα in the plasma membrane of female astrocytes. In male astrocytes, the estradiol-induced increase in mERα was attenuated, suggesting that membrane-initiated estradiol signaling (MIES) would also be blunted. Indeed, estradiol induced [Ca²⁺]ᵢ release in male astrocytes, but not to levels required to stimulate progesterone synthesis. Investigation of this sexual differentiation was performed using hypothalamic astrocytes from post-pubertal four core genotype (FCG) mice. In this model, genetic sex is uncoupled from gonadal sex. We demonstrated that animals that developed testes (XYM and XXM) lacked estrogen positive feedback, strongly suggesting that the sexual differentiation of progesterone synthesis is driven by the sex steroid environment during early development.

The assessment consists of firstly the lifetime extension of the passivation baths by selective removal of the tramp ions zinc and iron, and secondly, the recovery of zinc for further reuse. Spent passivation baths from a local industry were tested, being the major metallic content: Cr³⁺ 9000mgL⁻¹, Zn²⁺ 12,000mgL⁻¹, Fe³⁺ 100mgL⁻¹. Working in a Liqui-Cel hollow fiber membrane contactor and using the extractant bis(2,4,4-trimethylpentyl) phosphinic acid, reduction of zinc and iron concentrations below 60mgL⁻¹ and 2mgL⁻¹, respectively were obtained, while trivalent chromium, the active metal that generates the passivation layer, was retained in the baths. Zinc was selectively transferred to an acidic stripping phase that in the experimental time reached a concentration of 157,000mgL⁻¹. Zinc recovery by electrowinning from the acidic stripping phase without any pretreatment of the electrolyte solution provided a purity of 98.5%, matching the lower commercial zinc grade. As a result of the extension of the life time of the passivation bath, significant environmental advantages are derived such as minimization of the volume of hazardous wastes and savings in the consumption of raw materials.  aPublisher supplied data 3aions 3azinc 3aindustry 3airon 3araw materials 3aemulsions 3achromium 3asludge 0aelectrolytes1 aMediavilla, Rosa1 aUrtiaga, Ane1 aOrtiz, Inmaculada0 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2011 Aug. 30, v. 192, no. 2 p.801-807dElsevier B.V.x0304-38947nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2011.05.0913Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01807naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245010600166300001600272520079200288592002801080650001101108650001601119650001401135650002001149650001601169650002101185700001601206700002001222700001801242773009301260856008401353990002301437852000901460655001201469IND60103663320221118083159.0141106e20110331xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010366332DNAL7 a10.1016/j.matlet.2011.01.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Jing10aElevated-temperature plasticity and mechanical properties of a rare earth-modified Mg–Zn–Al alloy  ap. 944-947.  aThe elevated-temperature plasticity and flow behavior of an Er-modified, heat-resistant ZA73 alloy was evaluated by thermal simulation.

Nanoparticles can be incorporated into polymeric nanocomposites. Polymeric nanocomposites consisting of inorganic nanoparticles and organic polymers represent a new class of materials that exhibit improved performance compared to their microparticle counterparts. It is therefore expected that they will advance the field of engineering applications. Incorporation of inorganic nanoparticles into a polymer matrix can significantly affect the properties of the matrix. The resulting composite might exhibit improved thermal, mechanical, rheological, electrical, catalytic, fire retardancy and optical properties. The properties of polymer composites depend on the type of nanoparticles that are incorporated, their size and shape, their concentration and their interactions with the polymer matrix. The main problem with polymer nanocomposites is the prevention of particle aggregation. It is difficult to produce monodispersed nanoparticles in a polymer matrix because nanoparticles agglomerate due to their specific surface area and volume effects. This problem can be overcome by modification of the surface of the inorganic particles. The modification improves the interfacial interactions between the inorganic particles and the polymer matrix. There are two ways to modify the surface of inorganic particles. The first is accomplished through surface absorption or reaction with small molecules, such as silane coupling agents, and the second method is based on grafting polymeric molecules through covalent bonding to the hydroxyl groups existing on the particles. The advantage of the second procedure over the first lies in the fact that the polymer-grafted particles can be designed with the desired properties through a proper selection of the species of the grafting monomers and the choice of grafting conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3acatalytic activity 3achemical bonding 3aengineering 3ananoparticles 3aoptical properties 3apolymer nanocomposites 3apolymers 3asurface area1 aKalia, Susheel1 aCelli, Annamaria1 aNjuguna, James1 aHabibi, Youssef1 aKumar, Rajesh0 tProgress in polymer science.g2013 Aug., v. 38, no. 8 p.1232-1261dElsevier Ltdx0079-67007nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.progpolymsci.2013.02.0033Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02899naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245009500171300001600266520175200282592002802034650002302062650002202085650002202107650002002129650001602149650003302165650001502198650001802213650001302231650001202244650001702256700002102273700002102294700002102315773008402336856008402420852000902504655001202513IND60106049420221118025317.0141108e201302  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010604942DNAL7 a10.1016/j.powtec.2012.02.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKestur, Umesh S.10aInfluence of particle size on the crystallization kinetics of amorphous felodipine powders  ap. 197-204.  aThe goal of this study was to investigate the influence of particle size on the crystallization kinetics of amorphous felodipine powders stored below the glass transition temperature and to evaluate the role of surface versus bulk crystallization in influencing the kinetic profiles. Raman spectroscopy and powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) were used to monitor the crystallization of different particle size fractions of pure amorphous felodipine and solid dispersions containing 3wt.% polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP) stored at 30°C. Optical microscopy was employed to measure surface and bulk growth rates of felodipine in the absence and presence of PVP at 30°C. Solution concentration-time profiles for the various samples prior to and after crystallization were also measured. The growth rate of felodipine from the free surface was approximately 6 times faster than from the bulk in the absence of any polymer while the ratio of the surface to bulk growth rates was 23 in the presence of PVP. The overall crystallization rates of the amorphous powders were particle size dependent with smaller particle sizes crystallizing faster. Felodipine alone crystallized within 7days. However, in the presence of the polymer, crystallization was retarded and was incomplete after 6months. For the polymer-containing powders, biphasic crystallization was observed whereby rapid initial crystallization (50–60days) was followed by a much slower rate over the remaining time period. The initial rapid crystallization was attributed to a faster rate of surface growth. The dissolution profiles of the different powders were dependent on both the particle size and the extent of crystallinity, with the level of supersaturation achieved varying considerably.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRaman spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3acrystal structure 3acrystallization 3adispersions 3aglass transition temperature 3amicroscopy 3aparticle size 3apolymers 3apowders 3apyrrolidones1 aIvanesivic, Igor1 aAlonzo, David E.1 aTaylor, Lynne S.0 tPowder technology.g2013 Feb., v. 236 p.197-204dElsevier B.V.x0032-59107nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.powtec.2012.02.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01943naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245009100171300001600262520087800278592002801156650001901184650002501203650001501228650001901243650001201262650001801274650001301292650003301305700002001338700002501358700001701383773010001400856008401500852000901584655001201593IND60101912420221117173013.0141106e20120515xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010191242DNAL7 a10.1016/j.memsci.2012.02.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBoss, Christophe10aSize-selective diffusion in nanoporous alumina membranes for a glucose affinity sensor  ap. 217-221.  aThe retention, diffusion and structural properties of 2–4nm nanoporous alumina membranes were investigated in view of their integration as size-selective interface in a glucose sensor.

The fibroblast GAA activity in these patients is usually between 5% and 25% of the average in healthy individuals. In some adult patients, however, the fibroblast GAA activity is much lower and is in the range that is normally observed in classic-infantile Pompe disease. We investigated the genotype-phenotype correlation in three such adult patients and measured the GAA activity as well as the glycogen content in muscle and fibroblasts in order to better understand the clinical course. METHODS: DNA was sequenced and GAA activity and glycogen content were measured in leukocytes, fibroblasts and muscle. Muscle biopsies were microscopically analyzed and the biosynthesis of GAA in fibroblasts was analyzed by immunoblotting. GAA activity and glycogen content in fibroblasts and muscle tissue in healthy controls, adult patients with Pompe disease and classic-infantile patients were compared with those of the three index patients. RESULTS: One patient had genotype c.525delT/c.671G>A (r.0/p.Arg224Gln). Two affected brothers had genotype c.569G>A/c.1447G>A (p.Arg190His/p.Gly483Arg). In all three cases the GAA activity and the glycogen content in fibroblasts were within the same range as in classic-infantile Pompe disease, but the activity and glycogen content in muscle were both within the adult range. In fibroblasts, the first step of GAA synthesis appeared unaffected but lysosomal forms of GAA were not detectable with immunoblotting. CONCLUSION: Some adult patients with mutations other than c.-32-13T>G can have very low GAA activity in fibroblasts but express higher activity in muscle and store less glycogen in muscle than patients with classic-infantile Pompe disease. This might explain why these patients have a slowly progressive course of Pompe disease.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aadults 3aalleles 3aalpha-glucosidase 3abiopsy 3abiosynthesis 3abrothers 3adisease course 3afibroblasts 3aglycogen 3aheterozygosity 3aimmunoblotting 3aleukocytes 3amuscle tissues 3amuscles 3amutation 3apatients1 aKroos, Marian A.1 ade Vries, Juna M.1 aHoogeveen-Westerveld, Marianne1 aWijgerde, Mark G.J.M.1 avan Doorn, Pieter A.1 avan der Ploeg, Ans T.1 aReuser, Arnold J.J.0 tMolecular genetics and metabolism.g2012 Nov., v. 107, no. 3 p.485-489dElsevier Inc.x1096-71927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ymgme.2012.09.0033Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03299naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245003500168300001600203500001500219520176300234592002801997650001802025650002202043650001702065650003502082650001502117650001102132650001302143650001702156650001802173650002402191650001302215650001102228650001302239650001302252650000902265650003202274650002002306650002202326650002002348650001802368650001302386650001202399650002402411653003802435700002102473700001902494773011802513856008202631990002302713852000902736655001202745IND60100216420221121095331.0141105e201304  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010021642DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jaci.2013.01.0462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPieper, Kathrin10aB-cell biology and development  ap. 959-971.  a2019-12-04  aB cells develop from hematopoietic precursor cells in an ordered maturation and selection process. Extensive studies with many different mouse mutants provided fundamental insights into this process. However, the characterization of genetic defects causing primary immunodeficiencies was essential in understanding human B-cell biology. Defects in pre–B-cell receptor components or in downstream signaling proteins, such as Bruton tyrosine kinase and B-cell linker protein, arrest development at the pre–B-cell stage. Defects in survival-regulating proteins, such as B-cell activator of the TNF-α family receptor (BAFF-R) or caspase recruitment domain–containing protein 11 (CARD11), interrupt maturation and prevent differentiation of transitional B cells into marginal zone and follicular B cells. Mature B-cell subsets, immune responses, and memory B-cell and plasma cell development are disturbed by mutations affecting Toll-like receptor signaling, B-cell antigen receptor coreceptors (eg, CD19), or enzymes responsible for immunoglobulin class-switch recombination. Transgenic mouse models helped to identify key regulatory mechanisms, such as receptor editing and clonal anergy, preventing the activation of B cells expressing antibodies recognizing autoantigens. Nevertheless, the combination of susceptible genetic backgrounds with the rescue of self-reactive B cells by T cells allows the generation of autoreactive clones found in patients with many autoimmune diseases and even in those with primary immunodeficiencies. The rapid progress of functional genomic research is expected to foster the development of new tools that specifically target dysfunctional B lymphocytes to treat autoimmunity, B-cell malignancies, and immunodeficiency.  aPublisher supplied data 3aT-lymphocytes 3aimmunosuppression 3aautoantigens 3agenetically modified organisms 3aantibodies 3aclones 3apatients 3aautoimmunity 3aB-lymphocytes 3aToll-like receptors 3acaspases 3ahumans 3amutation 3atyrosine 3amice 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha 3aimmune response 3agenetic disorders 3aimmunoglobulins 3aanimal models 3agenomics 3amutants 3aautoimmune diseases 0aimmunosuppression (physiological)1 aGrimbacher, Bodo1 aEibel, Hermann0 tThe Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology.g2013 Apr., v. 131, no. 4 p.959-971dMosby, Inc.x0091-67497nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jaci.2013.01.0463Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03441naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094040001800138100001400156245007900170300001600249520181300265592002802078650000802106650001502114650001202129650004602141650001202187650001002199650001502209650001202224650001502236650001302251650001502264650002502279650001402304650001002318650001802328650002202346650001402368650001002382651001202392653001902404653002302423653002302446653001302469653002602482653002602508653002602534653002502560653002302585700002802608700001302636773011502649856009002764852000902854655001202863IND50065208720221118233044.0150427e200312  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006520872DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1654-109X.2003.tb00577.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMatus, G.10aRestoration prospects of abandoned species-rich sandy grassland in Hungary  ap. 169-178.  aSecondary succession and seed bank formation was studied in a formerly grazed, abandoned, eastern Hungarian sandy steppe-meadow (Pulsatillo-Festucetum). The vegetation was sampled at different elevations of a sand dune which became partly invaded by the tree Robinia pseudo-acacia ca. 10 yr ago. Pre-abandonment vegetation records were used as historic references. Though composition of the non-invaded grassland only changed moderately, dominance of tall grasses (Elymus hispidus, Poa angustifolia) increased significantly at the cost of annuals and low stature perennials. In the stand invaded by Robinia most grassland species were lost and replaced by nitrophytes. Vertical position influenced species abundance, but affected the composition only moderately. Fine-scale zonation of the vegetation also changed with time. Species richness of the above-ground vegetation and the seed density of soil samples at the lower elevation were slightly greater than at the higher sites. Seed banks of sensitive grassland specialists (e.g. Pulsatilla pratensis subsp. hungarica) disappeared during grass encroachment. Following extinction from above-ground vegetation, restoration must rely on dispersal from adjacent areas. In contrast, several annuals and perennials, which survived this degradation stage in the above-ground vegetation, possessed seed banks. Many of these species became extinct from the vegetation during the Robinia invasion but left viable persistent seeds. This fact is promising for restoration of the Potentillo-Festucetum sandy pasture. Competitive weedy species and sprouting Robinia can, however, limit seedling establishment.Nomenclature: Simon (2000) for taxa; Borhidi (2003) for syntaxa.Abbreviations: BIC = Bayesian Information Criterium, NMDS = Non-metric Multidimensional Scaling.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPoa 3aPulsatilla 3aRobinia 3aThinopyrum intermedium subsp. intermedium 3aannuals 3adunes 3aextinction 3agrasses 3agrasslands 3apastures 3aperennials 3asecondary succession 3aseedlings 3aseeds 3asoil sampling 3aspecies diversity 3asprouting 3atrees 3aHungary 0aCattle grazing 0aElevation gradient 0aHistoric relevéé 0aInvasion 0aPotentillo-Festucetum 0aPulsatillo-Festucetum 0aRobinia pseudo-acacia 0aSecondary succession 0aSeedling emergence1 aTóóthmééréész, B.1 aPapp, M.0 tApplied vegetation science.g2003 Dec., v. 6, no. 2 p.169-178dOpulus PresswJournal:jnl58701x1402-20017nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1654-109X.2003.tb00577.x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01664naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245008200166300001800248520050800266592002800774650002200802650001500824650002300839650004400862650002200906650002000928700002800948700001600976700002300992700001901015700001901034700002901053700002901082773008901111856008101200852000901281655001201290IND60109434920221119032041.0141109e20111125xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010943492DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tet.2011.09.0832doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFresno, Nieves10aOxazolidinone cross-alkylation during Evans’ asymmetric alkylation reaction  ap. 9104-9111.  aStarting from Evans’ imidazolidin-2-one (1) two compounds were obtained by trans-N-acylation: the expected one 3 with S,R configuration and a second compound 5, that is, related to 3 by the loss of a CH(CH₃)CO fragment.

It could also be an important therapeutic target for ameliorating various diseases, especially diabetic nephropathy (DN). We therefore studied the beneficial effects of olmesartan, an Ang-II type 1 receptor (AT-1R) blocker in streptozotocin (150mg/kg, BW)-induced diabetic kidney disease in mice. The diabetic kidney mice displayed upregulated protein expression levels of AT-1R, AT-2R, ERK-1/2, p-p38 MAPK, p-MAPKAPK-2, ET-1, p-JNK, p-c-Jun, TGF-β1, and gp91-phox, and all of these effects were expectedly downregulated by an olmesartan treatment. Also, immunohistochemical analysis, and Azan-Mallory and HE staining were performed to examine the expression of collagen-III and fibronectin, renal fibrosis, and hypertrophy, respectively. Furthermore, olmesartan treatment significantly abrogated the downregulation of ACE-2 and Ang-(1–7) mas R protein expression in diabetic kidney mice. Considering all these findings together, the AT-1R/MAPK pathway might be a potential therapeutic target in diabetes kidney disease, and olmesartan treatment could have beneficial effects on DN by modulating the AT-1R/MAPK pathway.  aPublisher supplied data 3adiabetic nephropathy 3afibronectins 3afibrosis 3ahypertrophy 3aimmunohistochemistry 3akidneys 3amice 3amitogen-activated protein kinase 3aprotein synthesis 3astreptozotocin 3atransforming growth factor beta 11 aThandavarayan, Rajarajan A.1 aWatanabe, Kenichi1 aSari, Flori R.1 aMeilei, Harima1 aGiridharan, Vijayasree V.1 aSukumaran, Vijayakumar1 aSoetikno, Vivian1 aArumugam, Somasundaram1 aSuzuki, K.q(Kenji),1 aKodama, Makoto0 tMolecular and cellular endocrinology.g2012 Jan. 2, v. 348, no. 1 p.104-111dElsevier Ireland Ltdx0303-72077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.mce.2011.07.0413Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02247naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245011300169300001600282520131300298592002801611650001901639650001001658650002201668650001601690700001901706700002001725773008401745856008401829990002301913852000901936655001201945IND60110930820221118054918.0141109e201302  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011093082DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ultras.2012.07.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, Hoe Woong10aCircumferential phased array of shear-horizontal wave magnetostrictive patch transducers for pipe inspection  ap. 423-431.  aSeveral investigations report effective uses of magnetostrictive patch transducers to generate and measure longitudinal and torsional guided waves in a pipe. They can be used to form a phased array for the circumferential inspection of pipes. Although there are circumferential phased arrays employing piezoelectric transducers or EMAT’s, no magnetostrictive patch transducer based array system has been attempted. In this investigation, we aim to develop a circumferential phased magnetostrictive patch transducer (PMPT) array that can focus shear-horizontal waves at any target point on a cylindrical surface of a pipe. For the development, a specific configuration of a PMPT array employing six magnetostrictive patch transducers is proposed. A wave simulation model is also developed to determine time delays and amplitudes of signals generated by the transducers of the array. This model should be able to predict accurately the angular profiles of shear-horizontal waves generated by the transducers. For wave focusing, the time reversal idea will be utilized. The wave focusing ability of the developed PMPT array is tested with multiple-crack detection experiments. Imaging of localized surface inspection regions is also attempted by using wave signals measured by the developed PMPT array system.  aPublisher supplied data 3aimage analysis 3apipes 3asimulation models 3aultrasonics1 aLee, Joo Kyung1 aKim, Yoon Young0 tUltrasonics.g2013 Feb., v. 53, no. 2 p.423-431dElsevier B.V.x0041-624X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ultras.2012.07.0103Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02628naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002600148245008800174300001800262520135500280592002801635650001001663650002001673650001201693650001101705650000901716650001701725650001501742650001901757650000901776650002401785650004401809650001601853650002101869650001901890650002501909651001001934700002401944700002201968773007801990856008202068990002302150852000902173655001202182IND60102651220221121113827.0141106e201104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010265122DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fuel.2010.12.0292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKashiwakura, Shunsuke10aVaporization behavior of boron from standard coals in the early stage of combustion  ap. 1408-1415.  aBoron-containing compounds have been listed as one of environmentally hazardous substances in Japan since 2001, and known to condense in coal fly ash particles during coal combustion and coal fly ash formation in coal-fired electric power stations. So far, the authors have revealed that the speciation of boron-containing compounds in coal fly ash particles is mostly a calcium orthoborate or pyroborate. In this research, the speciation of boron compounds in standard coals and their char generated by laboratory-scale combustion test has been investigated by using a microwave-assisted acid digestion method and a Magic-Angle-Spinning Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (MAS-NMR) in order to reveal the vaporization behavior of boron in standard coals during combustion at relatively low temperature. Three isolated peaks are observed in ¹¹B MAS-NMR spectra of standard coals, and all of them are attributed to four-oxygen-coordinated boron atom. Around 50% of boron vaporizes even though heating condition is 200°C and O₂=25%, and the percentage of vaporization reaches higher value than 80% at 400°C and O₂=25%. The remaining boron contents in ash components are relatively small, and it suggests that most of boron in standard coals exist with relatively volatile carbon contents, and they volatilize in the very early stage of coal combustion.  aPublisher supplied data 3aboron 3aboron compounds 3acalcium 3acarbon 3acoal 3acoal fly ash 3acombustion 3aelectric power 3aheat 3amicrowave treatment 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3atemperature 3atoxic substances 3avolatilization 3awet digestion method 3aJapan1 aTakahashi, Takafumi1 aNagasaka, Tetsuya0 tFuel.g2011 Apr., v. 90, no. 4 p.1408-1415dElsevier Ltdx0016-23617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fuel.2010.12.0293Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03538naa a2200709 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245015400165300001400319520139500333592002801728650002101756650001901777650002001796650002501816650001301841650003101854650001701885650001401902650000901916650001901925650001601944650001601960650001601976650001801992650004202010650001602052650002802068650001902096650003602115650001702151650002102168650001902189650001902208650001902227650002202246650001802268650002302286650001802309650001302327650001702340650002002357650002202377650000902399650002402408650003602432650002102468650003202489650001302521700002102534700001802555700002002573773010902593856008202702990002302784852000902807655001202816IND60110442720221119204809.0141109e20120401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011044272DNAL7 a10.1016/j.taap.2012.01.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDas, Joydeep10aMangiferin exerts hepatoprotective activity against D-galactosamine induced acute toxicity and oxidative/nitrosative stress via Nrf2–NFκB pathways  ap. 35-47.  aMangiferin, a xanthone glucoside, is well known to exhibit antioxidant, antiviral, antitumor, anti-inflammatory and gene-regulatory effects. In the present study, we isolated mangiferin from the bark of Mangifera indica and assessed its beneficial role in galactosamine (GAL) induced hepatic pathophysiology. GAL (400mg/kg body weight) exposed hepatotoxic rats showed elevation in the activities of serum ALP, ALT, levels of triglycerides, total cholesterol, lipid-peroxidation and reduction in the levels of serum total proteins, albumin and cellular GSH. Besides, GAL exposure (5mM) in hepatocytes induced apoptosis and necrosis, increased ROS and NO production. Signal transduction studies showed that GAL exposure significantly increased the nuclear translocation of NFκB and elevated iNOS protein expression. The same exposure also elevated TNF-α, IFN-γ, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-12, IL-18 and decreased IL-10 mRNA expressions. Furthermore, GAL also decreased the protein expression of Nrf2, NADPH:quinine oxidoreductase-1, heme oxygenase-1 and GSTα. However, mangiferin administration in GAL intoxicated rats or coincubation of hepatocytes with mangiferin significantly altered all these GAL-induced adverse effects. In conclusion, the hepatoprotective role of mangiferin was due to induction of antioxidant defense via the Nrf2 pathway and reduction of inflammation via NFκB inhibition.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMangifera indica 3aacute toxicity 3aadverse effects 3aalanine transaminase 3aalbumins 3aanti-inflammatory activity 3aantioxidants 3aapoptosis 3abark 3ablood proteins 3ablood serum 3abody weight 3acholesterol 3agalactosamine 3aheme oxygenase (biliverdin-producing) 3ahepatocytes 3ahepatoprotective effect 3ahepatotoxicity 3ainducible nitric oxide synthase 3ainflammation 3ainterferon-gamma 3ainterleukin-10 3ainterleukin-12 3ainterleukin-18 3ainterleukin-1beta 3ainterleukin-6 3alipid peroxidation 3amessenger RNA 3anecrosis 3anitric oxide 3apathophysiology 3aprotein synthesis 3arats 3asignal transduction 3atranscription factor NF-kappa B 3atriacylglycerols 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha 3axanthone1 aGhosh, Jyotirmoy1 aRoy, Anandita1 aSil, Parames C.0 tToxicology and applied pharmacology.g2012 Apr. 1, v. 260, no. 1 p.35-47dElsevier Inc.x0041-008X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.taap.2012.01.0153Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02124naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245009000169300001800259520110200277592002801379650001301407650001901420650001301439650001101452650003401463650001601497650002501513700002101538700002401559773008601583856008501669990002301754852000901777655001201786IND60105729920221118143028.0141108e20120912xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010572992DNAL7 a10.1016/j.polymer.2012.07.0652doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSong, Shi-hui10aStudy on high thermal conductivity of mesogenic epoxy resin with spherulite structure  ap. 4489-4492.  aThe microstructure of a mesogen-containing epoxy resin that exhibits high thermal conductivity (0.33 W/m K) was investigated by observations of the scanning electron microscope (SEM) and the polarized optical microscope (POM). It was found that there are many spherulite structures formed in the resin. We supposed that the reason for the high heat-conductivity obtained in the resin is ascribed to the existence of the spherulite morphology where highly ordered lamellar structures aggregated. The argument was strongly supported by preparing the resin films with size-changed spherulites which are induced by changing the initial curing temperature. The result revealed that the thermal conductivity increased with the increase in spherulite size. On the other hand, we have developed the spherulite size in the resin from 10 to 80 μm in diameter that resulted in a greatly improved thermal conductivity of up to 1.16 W/m K in the highest value. This study may provide a useful method to improve the thermal conductivities of mesogenic resins themselves by producing spherulite structures.  aPublisher supplied data 3aepoxides 3amicrostructure 3apolymers 3aresins 3ascanning electron microscopes 3atemperature 3athermal conductivity1 aKatagi, Hideyuki1 aTakezawa, Yoshitaka0 tPolymer.g2012 Sept. 12, v. 53, no. 20 p.4489-4492dElsevier Ltdx0032-38617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.polymer.2012.07.0653Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle04656naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002200151245012300173300001200296500001500308520316200323592002803485650001703513650001703530650001803547650001803565650001503583650002403598650001303622650002003635650002203655650001403677650001903691650001103710650000903721650002403730650001803754650002303772650001003795650002003805651001103825651001403836651002103850651001903871653002503890700001703915773007703932856008504009990002304094852000904117655001204126IND60103504020221121193253.0141106e20131205xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010350402DNAL7 a10.1016/S0140-6736(13)62595-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKhleif, Mohamad H10aQuality of life for Palestinian patients with cancer in the absence of a palliative-care service: a triangulated study  ap. S23.  a2019-12-04  aBACKGROUND: Cancer is a devastating illness that can deplete the resources of both the individual and the community. In the occupied Palestinian territory (oPt), it is the second leading cause of death (12%). Most cases are diagnosed at a late stage and patients are given little pain control and palliative care. In this study, we aimed to assess the determinants of quality of life (QoL) scores, and the symptoms in patients with cancer. METHODS: The study was done in the three main hospitals—Beit Jala Governmental Hospital, Watani Governmental Hospital, and Augusta Victoria Hospital—for cancer care in the West Bank, oPt, between May 1, to July 31, 2012. Patients (aged 18–90 years) with cancer who were attending the hospitals for treatment and follow-up were selected by convenient sampling and had qualitative in-depth interviews guided with five open-ended questions that were reviewed and validated by a palliative care doctor, a palliative care nurse, an oncologist, a social worker, and a researcher, and completed the cross-sectional quantitative European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30; scale 0–100). We did several statistical tests (t, ANOVA, χ², multiple linear regression analysis) using IBM-SPSS (version 19.0.0). We obtained written informed consent from all participants and interviewees, and study approval from the faculty board at the School of Public Health, Al-Quds University, East Jerusalem, West Bank, and the Helsinki Committee, Gaza Strip, oPt. FINDINGS: Ten patients completed the qualitative in-depth interviews and 323 (92%) of 350 completed the cross-sectional quantitative questionnaire EORTC QLQ-C30. In the qualitative interviews, respondents expressed several needs: financial aid, pain management, properly equipped health-care facilities in their vicinity, availability of medication, eradication of stigma, improved communication by the health-care team with the patient and psychosocial support, home nursing care, and palliative care. In the regression analysis, predictors of poor-health-related QoL (defined as <50; mean score 41·8) were advanced stage of cancer (β=−0·3; p<0·0001), poor economical situation (income <2000 NIS; β=0·19; p=0·001), low educational level (<10 years; β=0·12; p=0·04), and longer than 6 months of treatment (β=−0·11; p=0·04). The QoL domains with poor scores were physical (mean score 48·5), role (48·8), emotional (46·0), and social functioning (50·0), whereas the scores were worse for financial difficulties (64·6) and symptoms (fatigue [66·6], pain [63·0], and insomnia [56·4]). All these results were worse than were those for patients with cancer in Kuwait, Turkey, and the UK. INTERPRETATION: Palestinian patients with cancer encounter many difficulties in terms of their QoL. Palliative care for these patients should be integrated into the health-care system to improve their QoL. We recommend that policy makers integrate special services, such as palliative care, into the health-care system in the oPt to improve QoL and reduce suffering of these patients.

AD patients show reduction of cerebral blood flow (CBF), the extent of the reduction correlating with the impairment of cognition. There is evidence that cerebral hypoperfusion precedes and may even trigger the onset of dementia in AD. Cerebral hypoperfusion impairs neuronal function, reduces the clearance of Aβ peptide and other toxic metabolites from the brain, and upregulates Aβ production. Studies in animal models of AD have shown the reduction in CBF to be more than would be expected for the reduction in neuronal metabolic activity. Aβ may contribute to the reduction in CBF in AD, as both Aβ₁–₄₀ and Aβ₁–₄₂ induce cerebrovascular dysfunction. Aβ₁–₄₀ acts directly on cerebral arteries to cause cerebral smooth muscle cell contraction. Aβ₁–₄₂ causes increased neuronal production and release of endothelin-1 (ET-1), a potent vasoconstrictor, and upregulation of endothelin-converting enzyme-2 (ECE-2), the enzyme which cleaves ET-1 from its inactive precursor. ET-1 and ECE-2 are also elevated in AD, making it likely that upregulation of the ECE-2–ET-1 axis by Aβ₁–₄₂ contributes to the chronic reduction of CBF in AD. At present, only a few symptomatic treatment options exist for AD. The involvement of ET-1 in the pathogenesis of endothelial dysfunction associated with elevated Aβ indicates the potential for endothelin receptor antagonists in the treatment of AD.

The influence of Pt addition on the composition of the active catalyst surface was characterized by NH₃ temperature programmed desorption procedure. Addition of promoter improved the low temperature CH₄ combustion activity of the aged catalyst, though it caused a decrease in activity of the fresh catalyst. The changes in activity were related to changes in the ratio of the metal to metal oxide phases in the surface composition. Pt tends to create metal sites, whereas Pd prefers the formation of metal oxide sites. Catalyst preparation parameters affect the Pd/PdOₓ ratio of the non-promoted monometallic Pd catalyst, and the ratio needs to be known so that the proper amount of Pt promoter can be added.  aPublisher supplied data 3aammonia 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3acombustion 3adesorption 3amethane 3aplatinum 3atemperature1 aHirvi, Janne T.1 aSuvanto, Mika1 aPakkanen, Tapani A.0 tJournal of Molecular Catalysis.

A higher product yield of 464.3 g COD/g total solid (TS) was achieved in the reactor inoculated with digester sludge compared to rumen fluid with a value of 362.8 g COD/g TS. In contrast, the maximum product formation rate was 120.4 and 207.2 mg COD/L/d in the reactors with digester sludge and rumen fluid, respectively. Steam-explosion pretreatment improved the product yield by 18.5% and 14.5% for reactors inoculated with rumen fluid and digester sludge, respectively, while the product formation rate was increased by 128.7% for the first case but had no significant change for the second case.

The produced composite membrane has both unexpected superhydrophilicity and conductivity. The microstructure and morphology of the composite membrane were characterized by FTIR, UV–vis, XRD, TGA, and SEM. Effects of reagent concentrations and polymerization time on the membrane morphology and properties were studied systematically. A possible formation mechanism of the urchin-like polyaniline nanospheres on PTFE surface has been briefly discussed. The co-effect of both spherical micelles formed by Nafion and nanofibrous micelles formed by aniline/p-toluenesulfonic acid was considered to be a reason to produce the urchin-like PANI nanospheres. The PTFE/Nafion/PANI composite membrane showed a convertible hydrophilic/hydrophobic feature via adjusting acidity/alkalinity of an aqueous medium and also was able to adsorb heavy metal-ions from the medium.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3aacidity 3aalkalinity 3aaniline 3ahydrophilicity 3ametal ions 3amicelles 3amicrostructure 3ananospheres 3aoxidation 3apolymerization 3ascanning electron microscopy1 aZhou, Hui1 aDai, Tingyang1 aLu, Yun0 tJournal of colloid and interface science.g2012 Nov. 1, v. 385, no. 1 p.211-217dElsevier Inc.x0021-97977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2012.07.0273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02436naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245016200167300001400329520126200343592002801605650001301633650002601646650001501672650001601687650001501703650001901718650001501737650002601752650002701778650002901805700002301834700002601857773009701883856008501980852000902065655001202074IND60100392320221120214917.0141105e20120115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010039232DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jchromb.2011.12.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMerou, Anna10aDetermination of Carbadox and metabolites of Carbadox and Olaquindox in muscle tissue using high performance liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry  ap. 90-95.  aA sensitive and robust LC–APCI-MS/MS method has been developed for the unambiguous detection and quantitative determination of the antimicrobial agent Carbadox, its metabolite quinoxaline-2-carboxylic acid and methyl-3-quinoxaline-2-carboxylic acid the major metabolite of Olaquindox. The method was aimed for application in the assaying of muscle tissue so the developed sample preparation scheme subjected samples to enzymatic digestion prior to the application of solid phase extraction clean-up. Subsequently the purified extracts were analyzed by reversed-phase LC–MS/MS in positive APCI and multiple reaction monitoring mode. The method was validated at a level of 1μg/kg. The decision limits CCα and detection capability CCβ ranged from 0.09μg/kg to 0.24μg/kg and from 0.12μg/kg to 0.41μg/kg, respectively. The accuracy and precision of the method were satisfactory. The recoveries ranged from 92% to 101% for the metabolites and from 60% to 62% for Carbadox, with coefficient of variances (CVs) less than 12%. The developed method proved efficient and straightforward allowing positive identification and quantitation of the target banned analytes and is thus suitable for application in residue control programmes and metabolism studies.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbadox 3aliquid chromatography 3ametabolism 3ametabolites 3amonitoring 3amuscle tissues 3aolaquindox 3aquantitative analysis 3asolid phase extraction 3atandem mass spectrometry1 aKaklamanos, George1 aTheodoridis, Georgios0 tJournal of chromatography.g2012 Jan. 15, v. 881-882 p.90-95dElsevier B.V.x1570-02327nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jchromb.2011.12.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04824naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245013500169300001200304520334400316592002803660650002003688650003403708650001603742650001003758650001703768650001503785650001303800650001203813650002503825650001303850650001803863650002003881650002403901650001003925651001103935651001603946651001803962651001403980700001603994700001604010700001704026700002204043700002504065700002204090773007704112856008504189990002304274852000904297655001204306IND60103504120221121193310.0141106e20131205xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010350412DNAL7 a10.1016/S0140-6736(13)62596-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMassad, Salwa10aPerceptions of drug use and sexual behaviours of adolescents in the West Bank, occupied Palestinian territory: a qualitative study  ap. S24.  aBACKGROUND: Little is known about the health-risk behaviours of young people in the Middle East, particularly the occupied Palestinian territory (oPt). Our aim in this study was to gain insights into the prevalence and patterns of risk-taking behaviours of Palestinian youth. METHODS: We organised ten focus groups and 17 in-depth interviews with young people (aged 16–24 years) as part of the formative phase of a cross-sectional representative study of risk behaviours in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, oPt, in 2012. A combination of purposive and convenience sampling was used to select the sample, with representation of male and female young people from different localities in the region (urban, rural, refugee camps). The non-probability sample was balanced across these categories, but the people whom we interviewed might not be representative of the overall young Palestinian population. NVivo (version 9) was used for the qualitative analysis. RAND Corporation, Santa Monica, CA, USA, approved the study protocol in January, 2012. We obtained informed verbal consent from participants aged 18 years and older, and assent from participants younger than 18 years and their parents. FINDINGS: 83 individuals (42 male and 41 female; mean age 20·0 years [SD 2·2]) participated in the study. Participants reported that substance use and sexual activity outside marriage were common, even in conservative communities. Use of drugs, the most common of which were hashish and marijuana, was perceived to be especially prevalent in refugee camps and in East Jerusalem. The most commonly reported types of sexual activity were oral and anal intercourse. Vaginal intercourse was less common than were other types of sexual intercourse outside marriage. Some young people had sexual intercourse with sex workers; they went to brothels in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, and in Israel. Most respondents were of the opinion that young people did not usually use protection during sexual intercourse. INTERPRETATION: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study of the health-risk behaviours of young Palestinian people. By contrast with the conservative social context in the oPt, the findings suggest that drug use and unprotected sexual intercourse outside marriage might be more common than is currently assumed. These results might be perceived as indicating surprisingly high rates of sexual and other risky behaviours; however, we cannot exclude the possibility that participants might have overstated or understated drug use and sexual behaviours, but this possibility is unlikely to be a major concern for focus groups discussing young people in general and for participants who are of the opinion that there is a high prevalence of these behaviours. Health-risk behaviours in the oPt are a concern because of the low awareness of the potential health consequences. The results draw attention to the need to include sexual reproductive health on the national agenda and ensure that it is included in the programmes of national institutions. The formative findings from this study will be used to further explore the issues in a larger representative sample to improve understanding of prevalence, patterns, and causes of risk-taking behaviours.

However, little is known about its effects on immune system. In the present study, we aimed to investigate the immunosuppressive activity of erlotinib on T lymphocytes both in vitro and in vivo, and further explore its potential molecular mechanism. Erlotinib exerted a significant inhibition on the T cell proliferation and activation induced by concanavalin A, anti-CD3 plus anti-CD28, staphylococcal enterotoxin B or phorbol myristate acetate respectively in a concentration-dependent manner and it also inhibited the secretion of the proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-2 and IFN-γ of activated T cells. Further study showed that erlotinib caused G0/G1 arrest and suppressed the phosphorylations of c-Raf, ERK and Akt in activated T cells. Moreover, erlotinib significantly ameliorated picryl chloride-induced ear contact dermatitis in a dose-dependent manner in vivo. In summary, these findings suggest that erlotinib may cause the impairment of T-cell-mediated immune response both in vitro and in vivo through inhibiting T cell proliferation and activation, which is closely associated with its potent down-regulation of the c-Raf/ERK cascade and Akt signaling pathway.  aPublisher supplied data 3aT-lymphocytes 3aacetates 3acell proliferation 3aconcanavalin A 3acontact dermatitis 3adose response 3adrug therapy 3aears 3aenterotoxins 3aepidermal growth factor receptors 3aimmune response 3ainterferon-gamma 3ainterleukin-2 3alung neoplasms 3ametastasis 3amitogen-activated protein kinase 3asecretion 3asignal transduction1 aGu, Yanhong1 aZheng, Wei1 aWu, Xingxin1 aGong, Fangyuan1 aGu, Liyun1 aSun, Yang1 aXu, Qiang0 tToxicology and applied pharmacology.g2011 Mar. 1, v. 251, no. 2 p.130-136dElsevier Inc.x0041-008X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.taap.2010.12.0113Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02167naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001500147245011900162300001400281500001500295520081900310592002801129650002201157650001201179650002101191650001801212650001301230650001201243650001401255650003801269650004401307650002401351650001201375650001601387653002101403700001701424700001801441700001801459700001901477700001901496700001801515773008601533856008101619852000901700655001201709IND60110293720221118075317.0141109e20130410xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011029372DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tca.2013.01.0362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLima, L.S.10aSynthesis, characterization and thermal behavior of solid state compounds of heavy trivalent lanthanide succinates  ap. 31-36.  a2019-12-04  aSolid-state Ln–L compounds, where Ln stands for heavy trivalent lanthanides or yttrium(III) (Tb–Lu, Y) and L is succinate, have been synthesized.

Still it is very challenging job to model diesel engine due to its complex combustion phenomena. The focus of the present study is to review the different available model used for modeling of CI engines. The modeling of CI engine is divided into single zone, multizone and multi-dimensional model. Which further subdivided in many submodel i.e. heat transfer, ignition delay period, droplet evaporation, intake and exhaust flow, chemical kinematics and soot formation model. A comparative study has also been carried out with experimental validation to show the compatibility with different modeling approach. Some optimum mathematical input parameter has been suggested by the analysis of different modeling approach to minimize the NOₓ emission and soot formation to make diesel engine more eco-friendly.  aPublisher supplied data 3acombustion 3adiesel engines 3aevaporation 3aheat transfer 3akinematics 3amathematical models1 aKumar Chauhan, Manish1 aVarun, 0 tRenewable & sustainable energy reviews.g2013 Mar., v. 19 p.517-530dElsevier Ltdx1364-03217nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rser.2012.11.0433Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01386naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001100147245010000158300001800258520046300276592002800739650002200767650002300789650002300812650002200835700001800857700001400875700001700889773008800906856008100994852000901075655001201084IND60109435220221119032411.0141109e20111202xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010943522DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tet.2011.09.1302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHu, Yu10aEfficient and convenient synthesis of spiroindolinone-quinazolines induced by stannous chloride  ap. 9342-9346.  aAn efficient, convenient, one-pot synthesis of 1′H-spiro[indoline-3,2′-quinazoline]-2,4′(3′H)-dione derivatives was accomplished in good yields via the novel reductive cyclization of 2-nitrobenzamides and isatins mediated by SnCl₂·2H₂O system.

In this study, DNA vaccines expressing SAG2C, SAG2D, and SAG2X of T. gondii were constructed and their protective efficacy were evaluated in BALB/c mice. Mice vaccinated with pVAX1-SAG2C (pSAG2C), pVAX1-2D (pSAG2D) or pVAX1-2X (pSAG2C) showed higher levels of serum IgG antibodies and lymphocyte proliferation response compared to PBS and pVAX1 treated mice (p<0.05). The immune response was characterized by a strong Th1 response and increased cytokine production of IL-2 and IFN-γ. Vaccinated mice displayed significant protection against the challenge with the cyst of T. gondii genotype II strain of PRU (cyst-forming in mouse). A significant reduction in the brain cyst burden was detected in the mice immunized with pSAG2C (72%), pSAG2D (23%), pSAG2X (69%) alone and even more reduction rate, 77%, was achieved in the combination group compared to PBS treated mice. The results implied that immunization with DNA vaccines expressing SAG2C, SAG2D, and SAG2X, and, in particular, a combination of all three DNA plasmids, could effectively protect the mice against T. gondii chronic infection.  aPublisher supplied data 3aToxoplasma gondii 3aantibodies 3ablood serum 3abrain 3agenotype 3aimmune response 3aimmunization 3aimmunoglobulin G 3ainterferon-gamma 3ainterleukin-2 3alymphocyte proliferation 3amice 3aparasites 3aplasmids 3arecombinant vaccines 3asurface antigens 0aToxoplasma gondii 0aSAG2CDX 0aDNA vaccine 0aBradyzoite, Chronic infection1 aZhao, Lingxiao1 aSong, Jing1 aLi, Ying1 aZhao, Qunli1 aHe, Shenyi1 aCong, Hua0 tVaccine.g2013 Sept. 23, v. 31, no. 41 p.4536-4540dElsevier LtdwJournal:6210x0264-410X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2013.07.0653Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02602naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100003100148245010700179300001500286520157000301592002801871650001201899650001101911650001401922650002301936650001301959650002101972650001301993650001402006650002002020700001802040700001702058773008602075856008202161852000902243655001202252IND60100308220221123041105.0141105e201302  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010030822DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcat.2012.11.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWestgård Erichsen, Marius10aH-SAPO-5 as methanol-to-olefins (MTO) model catalyst: Towards elucidating the effects of acid strength  ap. 94-101.  aThe methanol-to-hydrocarbons (MTH) reaction was studied over a moderately acidic zeotype material, H-SAPO-5, at 350–450°C and with WHSV=0.3–5h⁻¹. C₃–C₅ alkenes were the main products of reaction, followed by C₆₊ aliphatics. Conversion-selectivity plots from experiments conducted at various contact times revealed that coking did not influence product selectivity significantly. Steady-state isotope transient experiments (¹²CH₃OH//¹³CH₃OH) were performed at 450°C. ¹³C incorporation was more rapid in the alkene products than in the polymethylated benzene molecules that were retained inside the catalyst after testing, suggesting that polymethylbenzenes contribute only to a minor extent to alkene formation in H-SAPO-5. Co-feed studies of methanol and benzene at 350°C revealed that benzene shifts the product selectivity towards ethene and aromatic products. Co-feeding ¹³CH₃OH and benzene at 250°C, giving <2% conversion of both reactants, indicated that polymethylbenzenes, when present in excessive amounts, may contribute to ethene and propene, but not to C₄₊ alkene, formation. Furthermore, the isotopic labelling pattern of ethene provided the first direct experimental evidence for ethene formation by a paring-type reaction from polymethylated benzene intermediates. Overall, the results obtained in this study suggest that a lower acid strength promotes an alkene-mediated MTH reaction mechanism, and that acid strength is therefore an important design parameter for selectivity optimisation in zeotype catalysis.  aPublisher supplied data 3abenzene 3acarbon 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3aethylene 3aisotope labeling 3amethanol 3apropylene 3astable isotopes1 aSvelle, Stian1 aOlsbye, Unni0 tJournal of catalysis.g2013 Feb., v. 298 p.94-101dElsevier Inc.x0021-95177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcat.2012.11.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02285naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002100148245008800169300001600257520137200273592002801645650001601673650001001689650002201699650001701721650001401738650002101752773009601773856008201869990002301951852000901974655001201983IND60105497120221118160700.0141108e201106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010549712DNAL7 a10.1016/j.phrs.2011.02.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBarton, Matthias14aThe discovery of endothelium-dependent contraction: The legacy of Paul M. Vanhoutte  ap. 455-462.  aThis article summarizes the discovery and the development of endothelial biology with a special focus on the role of endothelium-dependent vasoconstriction. The physician-scientist Paul Michel Vanhoutte contributed many of the initial observations that helped to understand and form the main concepts of modern vascular biology involving endothelial regulation. His laboratory was the first to report endothelial cell-derived vasoconstriction in 1981, followed by the characterization of an endothelium-derived constricting factor published by Hickey et al. in 1985, which was later identified as the endothelin peptide by Yanagisawa et al. in 1988. The identification of the receptor subtypes of this endothelial vasocontrictor two years later, which were named ETA and ETB receptors according to suggestions put forward by Vanhoutte, ultimately resulted in the development of the only new class of drugs that is entirely based on endothelial cell research. More than a quarter century after Vanhoutte's initial description of endothelial vasoconstriction, this first drug class specifically targeting an endothelial vasoconstrictor, the endothelin receptor antagonists, has been firmly established in cardiovascular medicine for the treatment of pulmonary hypertension. This novel therapeutic principle had its beginnings in Vanhoutte's discovery made 30 years ago.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantagonists 3adrugs 3aendothelial cells 3ahypertension 3areceptors 3avasoconstriction0 tPharmacological research.g2011 June, v. 63, no. 6 p.455-462dElsevier Ltdx1043-66187nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.phrs.2011.02.0133Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03541naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245011200167300001800279520199800297592002802295650001802323650001902341650001902360650001502379650001202394650002702406650002602433650000902459650001602468650002302484650001402507650001502521650002602536650000902562650002102571650002102592650001502613700001602628700002002644700001702664700001602681700001602697700001802713700001802731700002002749700002802769700001902797773009002816856008402906852000902990655001202999IND60111475520221119192122.0141109e201108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011147552DNAL7 a10.1016/j.wasman.2011.03.0222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPablos, M.V.10aCorrelation between physicochemical and ecotoxicological approaches to estimate landfill leachates toxicity  ap. 1841-1847.  aLeachates from municipal solid waste (MSW) landfills may contain a huge diversity of contaminants; these wastewaters should be considered as potentially hazardous complex mixtures, representing a potential environmental risk for surface and groundwater. Current MSW landfill wastes regulatory approaches deem exclusively on the physicochemical characterization and does not contemplate the ecotoxicological assessment of landfill leachates. However, the presence of highly toxic substances in consumer products requires reconsideration on the need of more specific ecotoxicological assessments. The main aim of this study was to evaluate the toxicity of different MSW landfill leachates using a battery of toxicity tests including acute toxicity tests with Daphnia magna and the anuran Xenopus laevis and the in vitro toxicity test with the fish cell line RTG-2. The additional objective was to study the possible correlation between physicochemical properties and the toxicity results obtained for untreated landfill leachates. The results showed that the proposed test battery was effective for the ecotoxicological characterization of MSW landfill leachates. A moderate to strong correlation between the measured physicochemical parameters and the calculated toxicity units was detected for all toxicity assays. Correlation factors of 0.85, 0.86 and 0.55 for Daphnia, Xenopus and RTG-2 tests, respectively, were found. The discriminant analysis showed that certain physicochemical parameters could be used for an initial categorization of the potential aquatic acute toxicity of leachates; this finding may facilitate leachates management as the physicochemical characterization is currently the most common or even only monitoring method employed in a large majority of landfills. Ammonia, alkalinity and chemical oxygen demand (COD), together with chloride, allowed a proper categorization of leachates toxicity for up to 75% of tested samples, with a small percentage of false negatives.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDaphnia magna 3aXenopus laevis 3aacute toxicity 3aalkalinity 3aammonia 3achemical oxygen demand 3adiscriminant analysis 3afish 3agroundwater 3alandfill leachates 3alandfills 3amonitoring 3amunicipal solid waste 3arisk 3atoxic substances 3atoxicity testing 3awastewater1 aMartini, F.1 aFernández, C.,1 aBabín, M.M.1 aHerraez, I.1 aMiranda, J.1 aMartínez, J.1 aCarbonell, G.1 aSan-Segundo, L.1 aGarcía-Hortigüela, P.1 aTarazona, J.V.0 tWaste management.g2011 Aug., v. 31, no. 8 p.1841-1847dElsevier Ltdx0956-053X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2011.03.0223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02964naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094024002200130024001900152040001800171100002000189245010200209300001400311520161400325592002801939650001901967650001001986650001901996650001002015650001502025650001002040650001602050650000902066650002002075650002002095650001202115700002102127700001902148700001802167700002102185700002602206700001802232700002102250773010902271856008202380990002302462852000902485655001202494IND60110443020221119210937.0141109e20120401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011044302DNAL7 a10.1016/j.taap.2012.01.0252doi7 aPMC33065472pmcid7 a223267842pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWalker, Mary K.12aA less stressful alternative to oral gavage for pharmacological and toxicological studies in mice  ap. 65-69.  aOral gavage dosing can induce stress and potentially confound experimental measurements, particularly when blood pressure and heart rate are endpoints of interest. Thus, we developed a pill formulation that mice would voluntarily consume and tested the hypothesis that pill dosing would be significantly less stressful than oral gavage. C57Bl/6 male mice were singly housed and on four consecutive days were exposed to an individual walking into the room (week 1, control), a pill being placed into the cage (week 2), and a dose of water via oral gavage (week 3). Blood pressure and heart rate were recorded by radiotelemetry continuously for 5h after treatment, and feces collected 6–10h after treatment for analysis of corticosterone metabolites. Both pill and gavage dosing significantly increased mean arterial pressure (MAP) during the first hour, compared to control. However, the increase in MAP was significantly greater after gavage and remained elevated up to 5h, while MAP returned to normal within 2h after a pill. Neither pill nor gavage dosing significantly increased heart rate during the first hour, compared to control; however, pill dosing significantly reduced heart rate while gavage significantly increased heart rate 2–5h post dosing. MAP and heart rate did not differ 24h after dosing. Lastly, only gavage dosing significantly increased fecal corticosterone metabolites, indicating a systemic stress response via activation of the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis. These data demonstrated that this pill dosing method of mice is significantly less stressful than oral gavage.  aPublisher supplied data 3ablood pressure 3acages 3acorticosterone 3afeces 3aheart rate 3amales 3ametabolites 3amice 3aradio telemetry 3astress response 3awalking1 aBoberg, Jason R.1 aWalsh, Mary T.1 aWolf, Valerie1 aTrujillo, Alisha1 aDuke, Melissa Skelton1 aPalme, Rupert1 aFelton, Linda A.0 tToxicology and applied pharmacology.g2012 Apr. 1, v. 260, no. 1 p.65-69dElsevier Inc.x0041-008X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.taap.2012.01.0253Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02178naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002700151245009600178300001800274520113700292592002801429650001601457650001901473650001101492650002301503650001301526650000901539650001301548700002501561700002001586700001901606773008601625856008501711990002301796852000901819655001201828IND60105730220221120082616.0141108e20120912xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010573022DNAL7 a10.1016/j.polymer.2012.07.0562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChantawansri, Tanya L.10aCoarse-grained modeling of model poly(urethane urea)s: Microstructure and interface aspects  ap. 4512-4524.  aPoly(urethane urea) elastomers are versatile and can be tailored to exhibit a broad range of mechanical response under high strain rate deformation. In this work, we utilize coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations to elucidate the molecular mechanisms, particularly the effects of hard segment content, intermolecular interaction, and rigidity of the interface between the hard and soft segments on local morphology and rate-dependent stress-strain behavior in the ballistic regime. Simulation results qualitatively agree with available experimental data, where analysis of hard segment orientation during tensile and compression deformation and dynamic strain rate sensitivity was also performed. Further study of the intermolecular interaction on the stress-strain behavior reveals that it has a strong effect on strain hardening, particularly for a rigid interface, once the hard segment content reaches the percolation threshold. Simulation results also show that interface intermolecular interaction could become more dominant over interface rigidity in the initial stress-strain response, particularly below percolation.  aPublisher supplied data 3adeformation 3amicrostructure 3amodels 3amolecular dynamics 3apolymers 3aurea 3aurethane1 aSliozberg, Yelena R.1 aAndzelm, Jan W.1 aHsieh, Alex J.0 tPolymer.g2012 Sept. 12, v. 53, no. 20 p.4512-4524dElsevier Ltdx0032-38617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.polymer.2012.07.0563Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02353naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245015600166300001600322520113200338592002801470650002201498650001501520650001901535650001201554650001301566650001301579650001101592650003501603650001601638650001601654700001101670700001801681700001301699700001401712773011301726856008401839990002301923852000901946655001201955IND60108816820221120203737.0141108e20110202xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010881682DNAL7 a10.1016/j.seppur.2010.11.0292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuang, Zhen10aOrganic template removal from hexagonal mesoporous silica by means of methanol-enhanced CO₂ extraction: Effect of temperature, pressure and flow rate  ap. 112-119.  aSupercritical fluid extraction was evaluated for removing the amine surfactant from hexagonal mesoporous silica materials. In this study, methanol-enhanced supercritical CO₂ extraction was carried out on freshly synthesized materials by means of a dynamic method. Experiments were performed at pressure ranging from 10.0 to 25.0MPa, temperature from 45 to 105°C, CO₂ flow rate from 0.45 to 4.5ml/min, and methanol flow rate from 0.05 to 0.5ml/min. The influence of these parameters on the extraction has been evaluated in terms of the surfactant recovery. The results show that by using this method up to 96% of the total amine surfactant used is extracted out of as-synthesized mesoporous materials within 1h extraction whereas only 78% of the surfactant can be removed by liquid ethanol extraction. The materials processed by supercritical CO₂ extraction are found to possess better structural properties as reflected by the X-ray diffraction analysis and N₂ adsorption results, and thus have higher thermal and hydrothermal stability than those obtained by liquid ethanol extraction or high temperature calcination.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3aadsorption 3acarbon dioxide 3aethanol 3amethanol 3anitrogen 3asilica 3asupercritical fluid extraction 3asurfactants 3atemperature1 aXu, Li1 aLi, Jing-Huan1 aKawi, S.1 aGoh, A.H.0 tSeparation and purification technology.g2011 Feb. 2, v. 77, no. 1 p.112-119dElsevier B.V.x1383-58667nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.seppur.2010.11.0293Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02142naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245014000166300001400306520104800320592002801368650002201396650003801418650001301456650001401469650001001483650001101493650001501504650001601519700003001535700003001565700002101595773008601616856008101702852000901783655001201792IND60110293820221118075257.0141109e20130410xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011029382DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tca.2013.01.0352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVafayan, Mehdy10aAdvanced integral isoconversional analysis for evaluating and predicting the kinetic parameters of the curing reaction of epoxy prepreg  ap. 37-43.  aThe kinetic parameters of the curing reaction of epoxy/glass prepreg have been evaluated and predicted by three different methods using the non-isothermal differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) data.

The aim of this study was the development, optimization and validation of a simple, specific and sensitive GC/MS method for the simultaneous determination of 11 antidepressant drugs and 4 of their metabolites (amitriptyline, citalopram, clomipramine, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, maprotiline, desmethyl-maprotiline, mirtazapine, desmethyl-mirtazapine, nortriptyline, paroxetine, sertraline, desmethyl-sertraline, venlafaxine and desmethyl-venlafaxine) in whole blood. The combination of solid-phase extraction with derivatization using heptafluorobutyric anhydride efficiently reduced matrix effect and improved sensitivity of the method. In this assay, protriptyline was used as internal standard. Absolute recovery values for all analytes were ranged from 79.2 to 102.6%. LODs and LOQs were found to be between 0.30–1.50μg/L and 1.00–5.00μg/L, respectively. The calibration curves were linear (R²≥0.990) within the range of 5.00–1000μg/L for all analytes. Accuracy expressed as the % Eᵣ was found to be between −12.3 and 12.2%. Precision expressed as the % RSD was found to be less than 11.7% for all antidepressants.

In this paper, we investigate the implementation schemes of the wavelet inverse-transform processor using SAW device. In the implementation scheme that the input interdigital transducer (IDT) and output IDT stand in a line, because the electrode-overlap envelope of the input IDT is identical with the one of the output IDT (i.e. the two transducers are identical), the product of the input IDT’s frequency response and the output IDT’s frequency response can be implemented, so that the wavelet inverse-transform processor can be fabricated. X-112⁰Y LiTaO₃ is used as a substrate material to fabricate the wavelet inverse-transform processor. The size of the wavelet inverse-transform processor using this implementation scheme is small, so its cost is low. First, according to the envelope function of the wavelet function, the length function of the electrodes is defined, then, the lengths of the electrodes can be calculated from the length function of the electrodes, finally, the input IDT and output IDT can be designed according to the lengths and widths for the electrodes. In this paper, we also present the load resistance and the internal resistance as the two problems of the wavelet inverse-transform processor using SAW devices. The solutions to these problems are achieved in this study. When the amplifiers are subjected to the input end and output end for the wavelet inverse-transform processor, they can eliminate the influence of the load resistance and the internal resistance on the output voltage of the wavelet inverse-transform processor using SAW device.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacoustics 3aelectrodes 3awavelet1 aZhu, Changchun1 aLiu, Qinghong1 aZhang, Jingduan0 tUltrasonics.g2013 Feb., v. 53, no. 2 p.447-454dElsevier B.V.x0041-624X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ultras.2012.08.0103Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02077naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245016300166300001600329520090500345592002801250650001901278650002501297650001401322650001101336650002601347650002701373650001201400650001301412650001501425651001101440700001601451700001901467773010301486856008201589990002301671852000901694655001201703IND60108015920221117233726.0141108e201303  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010801592DNAL7 a10.1016/j.rser.2012.10.0432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Yuan-Kang10aPlanning 10 onshore wind farms with corresponding interconnection network and power system analysis for low-carbon-island development on Penghu Island, Taiwan  ap. 531-540.  aA five-year, NT$8.09 billion project to turn Penghu, Taiwan, into a world-class low-carbon island was formally launched in 2011.

S26.  aBACKGROUND: The fertility of Palestinians in the occupied Palestinian territory (oPt) has fallen substantially from 6·2 children to 4·12 children per woman during the past 20 years. Contraceptives have a major role in birth control, but husbands are usually not included in research into the use of contraception. The aim in this study was to identify determinants and outcomes of the involvement of husbands in the decision to use contraception. METHODS: For the 2006 Palestinian Family Health Survey in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, oPt, 4486 (81%) of 5542 women (aged 15–54 years) who were married, not pregnant, and not menopausal were interviewed about the husband's involvement and interest in family planning. The women's responses were analysed with logistic regression models. SPSS (version 17.0) was used for the statistical analysis. This study was approved by the review board of the Paris Descartes University, Paris, France. The Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics obtained verbal informed consent from the women. FINDINGS: Three main factors—communication between the couple about contraception, desire for children, and husband's decision—determined whether and the type of contraceptive used (all types of contraceptive methods, male contraceptive, or female contraceptive). Contraceptive use was reported by 2444 (54%) of 4486 women: 1763 (39%) used female contraceptives and 681 (15%) used male contraceptives. Communication with the spouse increased the odds of contraceptive use compared with no communication (1488 [56%] of 2636 vs 956 [52%] of 1850; odds ratio 1·08 [95% CI 1·02–1·31). Women whose husbands wanted fewer children versus those who wanted more children were more likely to use contraception (373 [64%] of 582 vs 730 [52%] of 1394, 1·90 [1·41–2·56]), particularly male contraceptives versus female contraceptives (119 [32%] of 373 vs 189 [26%] of 730, 1·58 [1·21–2·05]). The use of contraception decreased when the husband (husband's decision 356 [44%] of 809 vs joint decision 1836 [58%] of 3186; 0·56 [0·46–0·69]) or the wife (wife's decision 240 [55%] of 433 vs joint decision 1836 [58%] of 3186; 0·76 [0·59–0·99]) made the sole decision about use of contraception. Women were less likely to decide on their own to use contraception if couples did not yet have a son (41 [8%] of 533 vs 248 [12%] of 2118; 0·60 [0·37–0·98]) and wanted another child (167 [8%] of 2108 vs 220 [12%] of 1790; 0·70 [0·52–0·95]). INTERPRETATION: Contraceptive use by Palestinians involves both husbands and wives. Communication between the couple and joint decision making lead to greater contraceptive choice, especially the use of a male contraceptive method. Thus, joint decision making is a determinant of the fertility transition in the occupied Palestinian territory, and should be considered in future research.

Although the overall effect of BaP on female fertility has been documented, the exact molecular mechanisms behind its ovotoxicity remain elusive. In this study we examined the effects of BaP exposure on the ovarian transcriptome, and observed the effects of in vivo exposure on oocyte dysfunction. Microarray analysis of BaP cultured neonatal ovaries revealed a complex mechanism of ovotoxicity involving a small cohort of genes associated with follicular growth, cell cycle progression, and cell death. Histomorphological and immunohistochemical analysis supported these results, with BaP exposure causing increased primordial follicle activation and developing follicle atresia in vitro and in vivo. Functional analysis of oocytes obtained from adult Swiss mice treated neonatally revealed significantly increased levels of mitochondrial ROS/lipid peroxidation, and severely reduced sperm-egg binding and fusion in both low (1.5mg/kg/daily) and high (3mg/kg/daily) dose treatments. Our results reveal a complex mechanism of BaP induced ovotoxicity involving developing follicle atresia and accelerated primordial follicle activation, and suggest short term neonatal BaP exposure causes mitochondrial leakage resulting in reduced oolemma fluidity and impaired fertilisation in adulthood. This study highlights BaP as a key compound which may be partially responsible for the documented effects of cigarette smoke on follicular development and sub-fertility.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabnormal development 3aadulthood 3aadults 3aanimal ovaries 3abenzo(a)pyrene 3acell cycle 3acell death 3acigarettes 3aconception 3afemale fertility 3afollicular development 3agenes 3aimmunohistochemistry 3ain vitro fertilization 3alipid peroxidation 3amice 3amicroarray technology 3aoocytes 3aoxidative stress 3apatients 3atranscriptome1 aPye, V.1 aNixon, B.1 aRoman, S.D.1 aMcLaughlin, E.A.0 tToxicology and applied pharmacology.g2012 Apr. 1, v. 260, no. 1 p.70-80dElsevier Inc.x0041-008X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.taap.2012.01.0283Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01529naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245008300168300001600251520063100267592002800898650001600926650001300942650002000955650001200975650001400987700001601001773009601017856008201113990002301195852000901218655001201227IND60105497320221118160721.0141108e201106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010549732DNAL7 a10.1016/j.phrs.2011.02.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTsui, Janice C.10aEndothelin-1 in peripheral arterial disease: A potential role in muscle damage  ap. 473-476.  aThe evidence for the role of endothelin-1 (ET-1) in endothelial dysfunction and atherosclerosis has been growing since its discovery. However most studies have focussed on cardiac disease and its role in peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is less clear. In addition to its role in the development and progression of atherosclerotic lesions in lower limb arteries, there is evidence that ET-1 adversely affects microvessels within the muscle and the viability of the ischemic muscle itself. This review summarises some of these findings which underscore the potential use of ET antagonists as an adjunct in the treatment of PAD.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantagonists 3aarteries 3aatherosclerosis 3amuscles 3aviability1 aShi-wen, Xu0 tPharmacological research.g2011 June, v. 63, no. 6 p.473-476dElsevier Ltdx1043-66187nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.phrs.2011.02.0123Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02466naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002800147245014800175300001400323520129600337592002801633650002201661650001201683650001201695650002201707650001601729650001301745650001201758650002301770650002401793650001401817650001901831650001801850650001401868700002201882773008601904856008101990852000902071655001202080IND60110293920221118075333.0141109e20130410xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011029392DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tca.2013.01.0372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCastronuovo, Giuseppina10aThermodynamics of inclusion complexes of natural and modified cyclodextrins with acetylsalicylic acid and ibuprofen in aqueous solution at 298K  ap. 44-49.  aThermodynamic parameters for the association of natural and substituted α-, β-, and γ-cyclodextrins with acetylsalicylic acid, salicylic acid and ibuprofen have been determined by isothermal titration calorimetry. Analysis of the data shows that complexes form, all having 1:1 stoichiometry. The shape-matching between the host and guest is the factor determining the values of the thermodynamic quantities. In the case of the smallest cyclodextrin interacting with acetylsalicylic acid and salicylic acid, the parameters indicate that hydrophobic interactions play the major role. Association occurs through the shallow inclusion of the benzene ring into the cavity. In the case of substituted β-cyclodextrins, instead, inclusion of the benzene ring is deeper and the tight fitting of the guest molecule to the cavity makes the enthalpy and entropy to be both negative. Ibuprofen interacts through its isobutyl group: the values of the association constants are very high for β-cyclodextrins as determined by the large and positive entropies due to the relaxation of water molecules from the cavity and the hydration spheres of the interacting substances. For all systems, a compensatory enthalpy–entropy relationship exists unless for those involving β-cyclodextrins and ibuprofen.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaqueous solutions 3aaspirin 3abenzene 3abeta-cyclodextrin 3acalorimetry 3aenthalpy 3aentropy 3agamma-cyclodextrin 3ahydrophobic bonding 3aibuprofen 3asalicylic acid 3astoichiometry 3atitration1 aNiccoli, Marcella0 tThermochimica acta.g2013 Apr. 10, v. 557 p.44-49dElsevier B.V.x0040-60317nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tca.2013.01.0373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02562naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002700150245010600177300001600283520129900299592002801598650001901626650001201645650001101657650001701668650001301685650000901698650002101707650001101728650000701739650001301746650003301759650001601792650002001808650001501828650002001843650000901863700002701872773011301899856008402012990002302096852000902119655001202128IND60108816920221122193726.0141108e20110202xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010881692DNAL7 a10.1016/j.seppur.2010.11.0302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEl Zeftawy, M.A. Monem10aUse of rhamnolipid to remove heavy metals from wastewater by micellar-enhanced ultrafiltration (MEUF)  ap. 120-127.  aIn this research, the rhamnolipid biosurfactant was utilized in micellar-enhanced ultrafiltration (MEUF) of heavy metals from contaminated waters. The effects of different major operating conditions on the (MEUF) system performance were investigated for copper, zinc, nickel, lead and cadmium using two membranes. The optimal conditions were successfully applied to treat six contaminated wastewaters from metal refining industries using the two membranes (>99% rejection ratio). To efficiently choose the most influential factors to the MEUF system, optimization by the response surface methodology approach was utilized and data quality was examined. Optimization by the response surface methodology and validation experiments determined that the best operating conditions were a transmembrane pressure of 69±2kPa, biosurfactant-to-metal molar ratios of approximately 2:1, a temperature of 25±1°C, and pH of 6.9±0.1. The rhamnolipid-enhanced ultrafiltration system was also to shown to treat samples of six contaminated wastewaters from metal refining industries using membranes with molecular weight cutoffs (MWCO) of 10,000Da and 30,000Da. The resulting heavy metal concentrations in the permeate were all significantly reduced to be in accordance with the federal Canadian regulations.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiosurfactants 3acadmium 3acopper 3aheavy metals 3aindustry 3alead 3amolecular weight 3anickel 3apH 3arefining 3aresponse surface methodology 3atemperature 3aultrafiltration 3awastewater 3awater pollution 3azinc1 aMulligan, Catherine N.0 tSeparation and purification technology.g2011 Feb. 2, v. 77, no. 1 p.120-127dElsevier B.V.x1383-58667nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.seppur.2010.11.0303Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02949naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245009900166300001700265500001500282520157300297592002801870650002101898650001901919650001501938650001601953650001501969650001801984650001302002650001102015650000902026650001302035650002002048650001502068650002002083653002102103700002402124700002402148700002302172700002102195700003002216773011902246856008202365990002302447852000902470655001202479IND60100143520221118062142.0141105e201101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010014352DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jaci.2010.10.0252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTabar, Ana I.10aThree years of specific immunotherapy may be sufficient in house dust mite respiratory allergy  ap. 57-63.e3.  a2019-12-04  aBACKGROUND: Specific immunotherapy (SIT) duration for respiratory allergy is currently based on individual decisions. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the differences in clinical efficacy of SIT as a result of the duration between the current recommended limits (3-5 years). METHODS: A 5-year prospective, controlled clinical trial of SIT blind until the first year and randomization to a 3-year (IT3) or 5-year (IT5) course was conducted. Of the 239 patients with respiratory allergy caused by D pteronyssinus initially included, 142 completed 3 years of SIT with good compliance. Twenty-seven controls were included at the third year. Efficacy of SIT after 3 (T3) and 5 (T5) years was assessed by using clinical scores, visual analog scales (VASs), rhinitis (RQLQ) and asthma (AQLQ) quality of life questionnaires, skin tests, and serum immunoglobulins. RESULTS: At T3, significant reductions were observed in rhinitis (44% in IT3 and 50% in IT5; P < .001), asthma (80.9 % in IT3 and 70.9% in IT5; P < .001) scores, VAS (P < .001 in both), RQLQ (P < .001 in both) and AQLQ (P < .001 in both). At T5, the clinical benefit was maintained in both groups, and IT5 patients presented additional decreases (19%; P = .019) in rhinitis scores. At Tf, specific IgG₄ measurements were lower in IT3 (P = .03) without detecting differences in IT5. An increase in asthma score of 133% was the only difference observed in controls. CONCLUSION: Clinical improvement is obtained with 3 years of D pteronyssinus SIT. Two additional years of SIT add clinical benefit in rhinitis only.  aPublisher supplied data 3aimmunoglobulin G 3aquestionnaires 3adust mites 3ablood serum 3acompliance 3aimmunotherapy 3arhinitis 3aasthma 3adust 3apatients 3aquality of life 3askin tests 3aclinical trials 0ahypersensitivity1 aArroabarren, Esozia1 aEchechipía, Susana1 aGarcía, Blanca E.1 aMartin, Santiago1 aAlvarez-Puebla, María J.0 tThe Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology.g2011 Jan., v. 127, no. 1 p.57-63.e3dMosby, Inc.x0091-67497nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jaci.2010.10.0253Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01494naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002500150245016800175300001800343520052100361592002800882650002300910650001900933650001400952650001400966650001400980700002100994773009601015856008401111852000901195655001201204IND60109899020221116170514.0141109e20120229xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010989902DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tetlet.2011.12.0512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSajith, Ayyiliath M.10aMicrowave enhanced Suzuki coupling: a diversity-oriented approach to the synthesis of highly functionalised 3-substituted-2-aryl/heteroaryl imidazo[4,5-b]pyridines  ap. 1036-1041.  aA modified approach for the synthesis of 3-substituted 2-aryl/heteroaryl imidazo[4,5-b]pyridines utilising palladium catalysed cross-coupling reactions under microwave enhanced conditions has been achieved. utilisation of (A-ᵗᵃphos)₂PdCl₂-catalysed cross-coupling reactions enables rapid derivatization of this (imidazo[4,5-b]pyridines) pharmaceutically relevant core.

This paper reports the modeling and optimization of biogas production on mixed substrates of saw dust, cow dung, banana stem, rice bran and paper waste using Artificial Neural Network (ANN) coupling Genetic Algorithm (GA). Data from twenty five mini-pilot biogas fermentations were used to train and validate a structured ANN with a topology of 5-2-1. The model served as fitness function for GA optimization process. An optimized substrate profile emerged with a predicted biogas performance of 10.144L. Evaluation of the optimal profile gave a biogas production of 10.280L, thus an increase of 8.64%, and an early biogas production initiated on the 3rd day of fermentation against the 8th day in non-optimized system. ANN coupling GA efficiently modeled the non-linear behavior of the process. A recipe for an optimum biogas production using the above co-substrates has been elucidated.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3abananas 3abiogas 3acattle manure 3afermentation 3afossil fuels 3aneural networks 3apollution 3arice bran 3asawdust 3atopology 3awaste paper1 aOloke, J.K.1 aLateef, A.1 aAdesiyan, M.O.0 tRenewable energy.g2012 Oct., v. 46 p.276-281dElsevier Ltdx0960-14817nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.renene.2012.03.0273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02230naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245008800165300001600253520116200269592002801431650002301459650001601482650002201498650001101520650003701531650001801568650003301586650001201619650003701631700001701668773011601685856008201801852000901883655001201892IND60100768820221118075557.0141105e20111201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010076882DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcis.2011.08.0182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Limiao10aSynthesis and characterization of dendritic and porous Ag–Pd alloy nanostructures  ap. 100-106.  aDendritic and porous Ag–Pd alloy nanostructures were successfully fabricated on the surface of silicon substrate using the co-reduction method and galvanic replacement reaction, respectively. The molar compositions of Ag and Pd in the alloy could be modulated by controlling the molar ratios of metal precursors and reaction time. The Ag–Pd alloy nanostructures were characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX), and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The morphology and phase of Au–Pd alloy nanostructures were discussed as a function of molar ratios of metal precursors and reaction time. In addition, the morphology and composition-dependent surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) of the as-synthesized Ag–Pd alloy nanostructures were investigated. The SERS enhancement factor was estimated and SERS mapping was performed to prove the homogeneity of these substrates. The results indicate that as-synthesized dendritic and porous Ag–Pd alloy nanostructures are good candidates for SERS spectroscopy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRaman spectroscopy 3aX-radiation 3aX-ray diffraction 3aalloys 3aenergy-dispersive X-ray analysis 3ananomaterials 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asilicon 3atransmission electron microscopy1 aLiu, Younian0 tJournal of colloid and interface science.g2011 Dec. 1, v. 364, no. 1 p.100-106dElsevier Inc.x0021-97977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2011.08.0183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03230naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245006500166300001800231520169800249592002801947650002001975650001301995650002202008650002502030650001402055650001402069650000902083650002602092650002302118650001102141650001502152650002102167650001202188650001102200650002202211650001802233650001802251650001602269650001402285650001402299650001602313650001602329650001302345650002402358650002102382650001802403700002902421773011202450856008202562990002302644852000902667655001202676IND60107854320221118064723.0141108e201106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010785432DNAL7 a10.1016/j.rser.2011.02.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKoh, May Ying12aA review of biodiesel production from Jatropha curcas L. oil  ap. 2240-2251.  aThe demand for petroleum has risen rapidly due to increasing industrialization and modernization of the world. This economic development has led to a huge demand for energy, where the major part of that energy is derived from fossil sources such as petroleum, coal and natural gas. However, the limited reserve of fossil fuel has drawn the attention of many researchers to look for alternative fuels which can be produced from renewable feedstock. Biodiesel has become more attractive because of its environmental benefits and it is obtained from renewable resources. There are four primary methods to make biodiesel: blending, microemulsion, pyrolysis and transesterification. The most commonly used method is the transesterification of triglycerides (vegetable oil and animal fats) with alcohol in the presence of a catalyst. There is a growing interest in using Jatropha curcas L. oil as the feedstock for biodiesel production because it is non-edible and thus does not compromise the edible oils, which are mainly used for food consumption. Non-edible oils are not suitable for human consumption because of the presence of toxic components. Further, J. curcas L. seed has a high content of oil and the biodiesel produced has similar properties to that of petroleum-based diesel. In this paper, an attempt has been made to review the different approaches and techniques used to generate biodiesel from Jatropha curcas oil.

However, due to sequestration of molecular messengers during interactions and other effects, collectively referred to as retroactivity, real biochemical systems do not exhibit perfect modularity. Biochemical signaling pathways can be insulated from impedance and competition effects, which inhibit modularity, through enzymatic futile cycles that consume energy, typically in the form of ATP. We hypothesize that better insulation necessarily requires higher energy consumption. We test this hypothesis through a combined theoretical and computational analysis of a simplified physical model of covalent cycles, using two innovative measures of insulation, as well as a possible new way to characterize optimal insulation through the balancing of these two measures in a Pareto sense. Our results indicate that indeed better insulation requires more energy. While insulation may facilitate evolution by enabling a modular plug-and-play interconnection architecture, allowing for the creation of new behaviors by adding targets to existing pathways, our work suggests that this potential benefit must be balanced against the metabolic costs of insulation necessarily incurred in not affecting the behavior of existing processes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenergy 3achemical reactions 3amodels 3asignal transduction 3aadenosine triphosphate 3aintracellular signaling peptides and proteins 3aenergy costs 3ainsulating materials 0aimpedance1 aSontag, Eduardo D.,0 tBiophysical journal.g2013 Mar. 19, v. 104, no. 6 p.1380-1390dElsevier Inc.x0006-34957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bpj.2013.01.0563Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02847naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004500094040001800139100002300157245009700180300001600277520137400293592002801667650002001695650000801715650001301723650002501736650001201761650001301773650001701786650001701803650001301820650001701833653001201850653001701862653002101879653002601900653001701926653001601943700006101959700006402020700002002084700007102104773011302175856009202288852000902380655001202389IND60532109520221121124425.0190412e201610  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053210952DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biosystemseng.2016.07.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCastellano, Sergio10aTest results and empirical correlations to account for air permeability of agricultural nets  ap. 131-141.  aFifteen HDPE agricultural nets were tested inside a micro wind tunnel (0.1345 m diameter) to establish their characteristic air flow rate vs pressure drop curves with velocities >4 m s−1. The air pressure drop through the net was accounted for, with reference to the Bernoulli scheme, by means of the loss coefficient. Experimental results confirmed those available in the literature, in terms of the dependence of the pressure drop on the velocity squared and the net porosity, ε, by means of the function h(ε)=(1−ε2/ε2). The influence of the orifice geometry was investigated and an effect equivalent to the increase in net porosity was identified in textile pores with elongated shapes. As with previous studies, the loss coefficient trend was found to fit the product of two functions, one depending on the porosity, and the other on the Reynolds number defined using the pore equivalent diameter. The calculated values of the loss coefficient show deviations from experimental results in the range of 19.9–41.1%. In addition, a new formulation for the loss coefficient, dependent only on the porosity and wet perimeter was proposed. Except for higher porosity nets the simplified formulation, showed the best match with the experimental data. The two formulations of the loss coefficient proposed here were compared with those found in the literature.  aPublisher supplied data 3aReynolds number 3aair 3aair flow 3aatmospheric pressure 3afabrics 3ageometry 3apermeability 3apolyethylene 3aporosity 3awind tunnels 0aAirflow 0aPorous media 0aLoss coefficient 0aDischarge coefficient 0aPlastic nets 0aWind tunnel1 aStarace, Giuseppe1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4272-71041 aDe Pascalis, Lorenzo1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1235-133X1 aLippolis, Marco1 aScarascia Mugnozza, Giacomo1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9136-89560 tBiosystems engineering.g2016 Oct., v. 150 p.131-141dElsevier LtdaIAgrEwJournal:jnl70639x1537-51107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biosystemseng.2016.07.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01560naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001800139245014800157300001800305520045100323592002800774650001400802650001400816650002300830650002300853650001700876650001400893650002000907700001900927700001800946700001500964700001200979700001800991773010501009856007501114852000901189655001201198IND60578844120221122082053.0170814e20140404xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057884412DNAL7 a10.1021/ol500248h2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Chunxia10aModular Synthesis of Benzimidazole-Fused Phenanthridines from 2-Arylbenzimidazoles and o-Dibromoarenes by a Palladium-Catalyzed Cascade Process  ap. 1872-1875.  aAn efficient palladium-catalyzed route for the synthesis of benzimidazole-fused phenanthridines from o-dibromoarenes and 2-arylbenzimidazoles is described.

Together with chemical and physical analysis, some biological analysis was performed. For each fish farm, three stations were sampled: two stations located inside the farm (ponds exit and farm exit) and one station located outside the fish farm, considered as reference site. The AZTI’s Marine Biotic Index (AMBI) and the BENTIX index were calculated, which are being used in assessing the ecological status of benthic communities within the European Water Framework Directive (WFD). Results were compared in order to evaluate the more suitable index for this study area. Both the indices gave similar results but AMBI resulted more sensitive than BENTIX, probably due to the small size of the collected samples. This study seems to suggest that AMBI, being not dependent from sample size, could be preferred as descriptor of benthic health status in CTEs.  aPublisher supplied data 3abenthic organisms 3acase studies 3aecosystems 3afish farms 3ahealth status 3aponds 3aItaly1 aBrambilla, Fabio1 aRimoldi, Simona1 aSaroglia, Marco1 aTerova, Genciana0 tAquaculture international.g2018 Apr., v. 26, no. 2 p.543-555dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl57531x0967-61207nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10499-017-0224-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02627naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245015000172300001600322520125200338592002801590650004001618650001501658650001801673650002401691650002801715650001201743650001101755653002601766653002501792653002301817653002601840653001901866653002701885700002501912700002301937700006101960773010102021856008602122852000902208655001202217IND60748085320221118180150.0211123e202111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074808532DNAL7 a10.1016/j.procbio.2021.08.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHollá, Veronika10aTransglycosylation properties of a Kluyveromyces lactis enzyme preparation: Production of tyrosol β-fructoside using free and immobilized enzyme  ap. 168-175.  aA variety of glycosides with interesting biological properties suitable for application in cosmetic and pharmaceutical industry can be found in nature. However, the demand exceeds the quantity and purity which can be obtained naturally and therefore enzymatic glycosylation has been of great interest in recent decades. In this study, crude Kluyveromyces lactis enzyme preparation Lactozym 3000 L was examined for the production of two phenolic glycosides – tyrosol β-fructoside and tyrosol β-galactoside. Its performance was compared to other commercial fungal and yeast enzyme preparations. It was found that the key enzyme, β-galactosidase is unsuitable for tyrosol β-galactoside production. However, one of the Lactozym 3000 L components, β-fructofuranosidase, performed very well in the tyrosol β-fructoside production from sucrose and tyrosol. Lactozym 3000 L was effectively immobilized onto activated carrier Lifetech ECR8309 via covalent binding of the enzyme, which is a promising method to reduce very high enzyme consumption in its free form. Potential of deep-eutectic solvents to enhance transfructosylation selectivity has been studied proving their interesting stabilization effect on Lactozym 3000 L β-fructofuranosidase.  aPublisher supplied data 3aKluyveromyces marxianus var. lactis 3aglycosides 3aglycosylation 3aimmobilized enzymes 3apharmaceutical industry 3asucrose 3ayeasts 0aβ-fructofuranosidase 0aKluyveromyces lactis 0aTransglycosylation 0aTyrosol β-fructoside 0aImmobilization 0aDeep eutectic solvents1 aKarkeszová, Klaudia1 aAntošová, Monika1 aPolakovič, Milan1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0238-89960 tProcess biochemistry.g2021 Nov., v. 110 p.168-175dElsevier LtdwJournal:12511x1359-51137nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.procbio.2021.08.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03323naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005500148245012500203300001400328520153500342592002801877650002301905650002201928650001101950650001401961650001801975650001101993650001602004650002002020650001402040650001402054650001202068650001402080650001202094650001202106650002602118650001102144650001102155650002802166650001102194650001002205650001802215650001402233650000902247650001002256650001402266650001302280653002602293653001802319653002702337653001702364653001402381700001802395700002902413700001702442773012502459856008302584961000902667852000902676655001202685IND60569159920221118132125.0190405e201801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056915992DNAL7 a10.1016/j.pmpp.2017.05.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRadhika, S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3454-139310aIndividual and synergist activities of monocrotophos with neem based pesticide, Vijayneem against Spodoptera litura Fab.  ap. 54-68.  aEvaluation of monocrotophos and Azadirachta indica oil, herein referred to as ‘Vijayneem’, were combined in ratios of 10% (10: 90), 20% (20: 80), 30% (30: 70), 40% (40: 60) and 50% (50: 50) [Monocrotophos: Vijayneem] under laboratory conditions to determine efficacy for properties of pesticidal, repellency, attraction, stimulant of consumption, development and reproduction.

All channels in an offset T-injector-design-chip (25-µm deep by 50-µm wide channels) were filled by capillary action with an acrylate-based PPM precursor solution and polymerized in situ using 365 nm light for several minutes. Photodefinability of the monolith cast in the channels during the polymerization process was also demonstrated by masking off the injection arms during photoinitiation. The chromatographic performance of this chip was compared with that of chips completely filled with monolith. The detection window was photodefined after polymerization using the detection laser (257 nm doubled argon ion laser) to depolymerize the detection window. A successful ChEC separation of 10 out of 13 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) was performed with on-column, off-packing laser-induced fluorescence detection at 257 nm. Van Deemter plots for early-, middle-, and late-eluting compounds showed the minimum plate height to be 5 µm. The average number of theoretical plates per meter for the PAH was 200,000. Several factors contributed to irreproducible results. Oxygen was observed to dynamically quench the fluorescence of the sample over time. Improved sealing of the reservoirs solved this problem. A within-chip variability in the retention time of 2–10% RSD was observed. These results demonstrate the feasibility and reliability of the PPM as a solid reversed-phase for electroosmotic flow-driven chip-based chromatography in microscale total analysis systems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aargon (noble gases) 3acapillarity 3aelectrochromatography 3afluorescence 3aoxygen 3apolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 3apolymerization 3apolymers 3asystems analysis1 aChoi, Wen-Yee1 aNgola, Sarah M.1 aShepodd, Timothy J.0 tFresenius' journal of analytical chemistry.g2001 Sept., v. 371, no. 2 p.174-181dSpringer-Verlagx0937-06337nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s0021601009483Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03152naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001500147245010600162300001400268520202000282592002802302650001402330650001002344650001102354650000902365650001902374650002402393650001102417650001502428650002302443650001502466650001802481651001002499700001502509700001702524773013402541856008202675852000902757655001202766IND60588743620221120024420.0180619e201801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058874362DNAL7 a10.1007/s11368-017-1742-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Xilin10aCharacteristics of slope runoff and soil water content in benggang colluvium under simulated rainfall  ap. 39-48.  aPURPOSE: The slope-produced runoff time (runoff time) of colluvium in a benggang (collapse hill and erosion gully) is related to rainfall characteristics and water infiltration as well as slope angle. Additionally, soil water content (SWC) directly correlates with rainfall intensity. This research analyzed the slope-runoff characteristics and the SWC distribution of the colluvium in a benggang catchment by simulated rainfall experiments in situ and the detection of the PR2/6 soil moisture profile probe. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The simulated rainfall experiments were conducted at Liantanggang benggang in Wuhua county, Guangdong province of southern China. Four old and three new colluvial slopes were selected as the study cases, and the characteristics of their slope runoff and their SWC distribution were investigated using 28 simulated rainfall experiments. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: A negative power function existed between runoff time and rainfall intensity. Moreover, a negative logarithmic function existed between runoff time and initial SWC at a 10-cm depth in the old colluvium. A 3D model was established to predict the runoff time using rainfall intensity and initial SWC. When the rainfall intensity was ≥3.5 mm min⁻¹, the runoff time exhibited a linear negative correlation with the slope angle. The simulated rainfall caused variations in profile SWC. At the 10-cm depth, the old colluvium had an SWC over 20%, whereas the SWC of the new colluvium was below 20%. After 24 h passed, the infiltrated water was redistributed and deeper wetting front depths were observed in the new colluvium than in the old colluvium. CONCLUSIONS: The results demonstrate that the ‘rainfall intensity-initial SWC-runoff time’ model for the colluvial slopes of benggang catchments could be used to predict runoff time based on rainfall intensity and initial SWC. The wetting front depth of the profile SWC could imply that the unstable depth of the colluvium may be beyond the maximum depth of 100 cm.  aPublisher supplied data 3acolluvium 3ahills 3amodels 3arain 3arain intensity 3arainfall simulation 3arunoff 3asoil water 3asoil water content 3awatersheds 3awetting front 3aChina1 aQiu, Jinan1 aZhang, Dalin0 tJournal of soils and sediments.g2018 Jan., v. 18, no. 1 p.39-48dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl3949862x1439-01087nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11368-017-1742-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01815naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245017000172300001800342520080000360592002801160650001201188650001601200650002001216650002801236653001401264653001701278653001501295653002201310773010901332856005101441852000901492655001201501IND50087648120221118234131.0140412e20120501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008764812DNAL7 a10.1080/00222933.2012.6545162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJudson, Mark L.I.10aStatus of the family-group names of Arachnida first published in Band I, Abtheilung 1 of Berendt's Die im Bernstein befindlichen organischen Reste der Vorwelt (1845)  ap. 1273-1282.  aThe status of the arachnid names published in Berendt's 1845 work Die im Bernstein befindlichen organischen Reste der Vorwelt (Band I, Abtheilung 1) is reassessed.

Recently a lot of attention has been dedicated to HER from single atom catalysts (SACs). The activity of SACs in HER is usually rationalized or predicted using the original model proposed by Nørskov where the free energy of a H atom adsorbed on an extended metal surface M (formation of an MH intermediate) is used to explain the trends in the exchange current for HER. However, SACs differ substantially from metal surfaces and can be considered analogues of coordination compounds. In coordination chemistry, at variance with metal surfaces, stable dihydride or dihydrogen complexes (HMH) can form. We show that the same can occur on SACs and that the formation of stable HMH intermediates, in addition to the MH one, may change the kinetics of the process. Extending the original kinetic model to the case of two intermediates (MH and HMH), one obtains a three-dimensional volcano plot for the HER on SACs. DFT numerical simulations on 55 models demonstrate that the new kinetic model may lead to completely different conclusions about the activity of SACs in HER. The results are validated against selected experimental cases. The work provides an example of the important analogies between the chemistry of SACs and that of coordination compounds.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGibbs free energy 3acoordination compounds 3aelectrochemistry 3ahydrogen production 3akinetics 3avariance1 aCipriano, Luis A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3801-77511 aPacchioni, Gianfranco1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4749-07510 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2021 Nov. 25, v. 143, no. 48 p.20431-20441dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19166x1520-51267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jacs.1c104703Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02579naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245008000167300001600247520149800263592002801761650001401789650001201803650002001815650001401835650002101849650001201870650001501882650001101897650001501908650001001923651003701933700002801970700001801998773009902016856008102115852000902196655001202205IND60440759620221116181558.0160903e201509  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6044075962DNAL7 a10.1007/s13595-014-0434-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPicard, Nicolas10aReducing the error in biomass estimates strongly depends on model selection  ap. 811-823.  aKEY MESSAGE : Improving the precision of forest biomass estimates requires prioritizing the different sources of errors. In a tropical moist forest in central Africa, the choice of the allometric equation was found to be the main source of error. CONTEXT : When estimating the forest biomass at the landscape level using forest inventory data and allometric models, there is a chain of propagation of errors including the measurement errors, the models' prediction error, the error due to the model choice, and the sampling error. AIMS : This study aims at comparing the contributions of these different sources of error to the total error, to prioritize them, and improve the precision of biomass estimates. METHODS : Using a 9-ha permanent sample plot in a moist forest near Kisangani in the Democratic Republic of Congo and seven competing allometric models, we estimated the contributions of the different sources of error to the total error of the per hectare biomass estimate, for plot sizes ranging from 0.04 to 1 ha. RESULTS : When there was no a priori on which model being the best and for 1-ha plots, the error due to the model choice was the largest source of error (76 % of the total error). Using weights to combine the predictions of the different models into a single ensemble prediction strongly reduced this error. CONCLUSION : Collecting training data sets on tree biomass at many sites would be needed to improve the precision of forest biomass estimates in central Africa.  aPublisher supplied data 3aallometry 3abiomass 3adata collection 3aequations 3aforest inventory 3aforests 3alandscapes 3amodels 3aprediction 3atrees 3aDemocratic Republic of the Congo1 aBoyemba Bosela, Faustin1 aRossi, Vivien0 tAnnals of forest science.g2015 Sept., v. 72, no. 6 p.811-823dSpringer Parisx1286-45607nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13595-014-0434-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03832naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245008400165300001600249520259800265592002802863650002902891650002602920650001902946650001702965650001302982650001702995650002103012650000903033650001103042650001103053650001303064650001103077650001903088700001703107700001903124700002103143700001903164773013603183856008203319852000903401655001203410IND60588743720221120024436.0180619e201801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058874372DNAL7 a10.1007/s11368-017-1736-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Xin-Nan10aElectron shuttle-mediated microbial Fe(III) reduction under alkaline conditions  ap. 159-168.  aPURPOSE: Extracellular Fe(III) reduction plays an important role in a variety of biogeochemical processes. Several mechanisms for microbial Fe(III) reduction in pH-neutral environments have been proposed, but pathways of microbial Fe(III) reduction within alkaline conditions have not been clearly identified. Alkaline soils are vastly distributed; thus, a better understanding of microbial Fe(III) reduction under alkaline conditions is of significance. The purpose of this study is to explore the dominant mechanism of bacterial iron reduction in alkaline environments. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We used antraquinone-2,6-disulfonate (AQDS) as a representative of quinone moities of humic substances and elemental sulfur and sulfate as sulfur species to investigate the potential role of humic substances and sulfur species in mediating microbial Fe(III) reduction in alkaline environments. We carried out thermodynamic calculations to predict the ability of bacteria to reduce Fe(III) (oxyhydr)oxides under alkaline conditions and the ability of AQDS and sulfur species to serve as electron acceptors for microbial anaerobic respiration in an assumed alkaline soil environments. A series of incubation experiments with two model dissimilatory metal reducing bacteria, Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 and Geobacter sulfurreducens PCA as well as mixed bacteria enriched from a soil were performed to confirm the contribution of AQDS and sulfur species to Fe(III) reduction under alkaline conditions. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Based on thermodynamic calculations, we predicted that, under alkaline conditions, the enzymatic reduction of Fe(III) (oxyhydr)oxides would be thermodynamically feasible but very weak. In our incubation experiments, the reduction of ferrihydrite by anaerobic cultures of Shewanella oneidensis MR-1, Geobacter sulfurreducens PCA or microbes enriched from a soil was significantly increased in the presence of S⁰ or AQDS. Notably, AQDS contributed more to promoting Fe(III) reduction as a soluble electron shuttle than S⁰ did under the alkaline conditions probably because of different mechanisms of microbial utilization of AQDS and S⁰. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that microbial reduction of Fe(III) (oxyhydr)oxides under alkaline conditions may proceed via a pathway mediated by electron shuttles such as AQDS and S⁰. Considering the high ability of electron shuttling and vast distribution of humic substances, we suggest that humic substance-mediated Fe(III) reduction may potentially be the dominant mechanism for Fe(III) reduction in alkaline environments.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGeobacter sulfurreducens 3aShewanella oneidensis 3aalkaline soils 3aanaerobiosis 3abacteria 3aferrihydrite 3ahumic substances 3airon 3amodels 3aoxides 3asulfates 3asulfur 3athermodynamics1 aSun, Guo-Xin1 aLi, Xiao Ming,1 aClarke, ThomasA.1 aZhu, Yong-Guan0 tJournal of soils and sediments.g2018 Jan., v. 18, no. 1 p.159-168dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl3949862x1439-01087nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11368-017-1736-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02248naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245006400158520106400222592002801286650002301314650005201337650001301389650002801402650001001430650002101440650001201461650001801473650001301491650001401504650001201518650001301530650001701543650001601560651001301576700002301589700001801612773012401630856007501754852000901829655001201838IND60754307320221121022710.0211023e20210928xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075430732DNAL7 a10.3390/nu131034462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Zhaoping 14aThe Impact of Obesity on SARS-CoV-2 Pandemic Mortality Risk  aThe COVID-19 pandemic has uncovered the increased susceptibility of individuals with obesity to infection and severe disease leading to hospitalization and death. Studies in New York City demonstrated that after advanced age, obesity was the most common risk factor leading to severe disease and death from COVID-19. While the connection has been recognized, there has not been a general recognition of the potential mechanisms for this link between excess body fat and mortality from this viral pandemic including respiratory complications and sequelae of increased activation of the immune system. Despite plans for vaccination of the global population, the risk community spread of COVID-19 and future pandemics will be linked in part to obesity and immunity. This review will detail a number of potential mechanisms through which obesity may contribute to the lethality of this viral infection. These insights will hopefully lead to a greater emphasis on obesity prevention and treatment as part of the global response to this and future pandemic threats.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCOVID-19 infection 3aSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 3abody fat 3acomplications (disease) 3adeath 3adisease severity 3aelderly 3aimmune system 3aimmunity 3amortality 3aobesity 3apandemic 3arisk factors 3avaccination 3aNew York1 aSurampudi, Vijaya 1 aHeber, David 0 tNutrients.g2021 Sept. 28, v. 13, no. 10dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2271x2072-66437nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu131034463Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03744naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003900113040001800152100001900170245014900189300001400338520217700352592002802529650001902557650001902576650001402595650001502609650001302624650001102637650001102648650001702659650001402676650002702690650001902717650001902736650002402755650001902779650003802798650002402836650002202860650001302882650002002895650003002915651001902945651001302964651001302977700001302990700001503003773010203018856008503120852000903205655001203214IND60113276120221120062213.0141111e20121130xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011327612DNAL7 a228207472pmid7 a10.1016/j.jenvman.2012.06.0362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRice, Karen C.10aAssessment of salinity intrusion in the James and Chickahominy Rivers as a result of simulated sea-level rise in Chesapeake Bay, East Coast, USA  ap. 61-69.  aGlobal sea level is rising, and the relative rate in the Chesapeake Bay region of the East Coast of the United States is greater than the worldwide rate. Sea-level rise can cause saline water to migrate upstream in estuaries and rivers, threatening freshwater habitat and drinking-water supplies. The effects of future sea-level rise on two tributaries of Chesapeake Bay, the James and Chickahominy (CHK) Rivers, were evaluated in order to quantify the salinity change with respect to the magnitude of sea-level rise. Such changes are critical to: 1) local floral and faunal habitats that have limited tolerance ranges to salinity; and 2) a drinking-water supply for the City of Newport News, Virginia. By using the three-dimensional Hydrodynamic-Eutrophication Model (HEM-3D), sea-level rise scenarios of 30, 50, and 100 cm, based on the U.S. Climate Change Science Program for the mid-Atlantic region for the 21st century, were evaluated. The model results indicate that salinity increases in the entire river as sea level rises and that the salinity increase in a dry year is greater than that in a typical year. In the James River, the salinity increase in the middle-to-upper river (from 25 to 50 km upstream of the mouth) is larger than that in the lower and upper parts of the river. The maximum mean salinity increase would be 2 and 4 ppt for a sea-level rise of 50 and 100 cm, respectively. The upstream movement of the 10 ppt isohaline is much larger than the 5 and 20 ppt isohalines. The volume of water with salinity between 10 and 20 ppt would increase greatly if sea level rises 100 cm. In the CHK River, with a sea-level rise of 100 cm, the mean salinity at the drinking-water intake 34 km upstream of the mouth would be about 3 ppt in a typical year and greater than 5 ppt in a dry year, both far in excess of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's secondary standard for total dissolved solids for drinking water. At the drinking-water intake, the number of days of salinity greater than 0.1 ppt increases with increasing sea-level rise; during a dry year, 0.1 ppt would be exceeded for more than 100 days with as small a rise as 30 cm.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimate change 3adrinking water 3aestuaries 3afreshwater 3ahabitats 3amodels 3arivers 3asaline water 3asea level 3atotal dissolved solids 3awater salinity 2aClimate Change 2aComputer Simulation 2aDrinking Water 2aEnvironmental Monitoringxmethods 2aModels, Theoretical 2aRiversxchemistry 2aSalinity 2aWater Movements 2aWater Pollution, Chemical 3aChesapeake Bay 3aVirginia 0aVirginia1 aHong, Bo1 aShen, Jian0 tJournal of environmental management.g2012 Nov. 30, v. 111 p.61-69dElsevier Ltdx0301-47977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2012.06.0363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02318naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245009900168300001600267520085300283592002801136650002301164650003501187650000901222650001001231650001301241650001001254650002401264650001401288650003001302650002201332650003801354650003701392650001201429651001001441653002601451653002401477653002001501653002101521653003701542700001101579700001801590700001901608773011501627856008501742852000901827655001201836IND60532109820221121160728.0190412e201610  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053210982DNAL7 a10.1016/j.meegid.2016.07.0202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Chuanfeng10aNovel duck parvovirus identified in Cherry Valley ducks (Anas platyrhynchos domesticus), China  ap. 278-280.  aAn unknown infectious disease in Cherry Valley ducks (Anas platyrhynchos domesticus) characterized by short beak and strong growth retardation occurred in China during 2015. The causative agent of this disease, tentatively named duck short beak and dwarfism syndrome (DSBDS), as well as the evolutionary relationships between this causative agent and all currently known avian-origin parvoviruses were clarified by virus isolation, transmission electron microscope (TEM) observation, analysis of nuclear acid type, (RT-)PCR identification, whole genome sequencing, and NS1 protein sequences-based phylogenetic analyses. The results indicated that the causative agent of DSBDS is closely related with the goose parvovirus-like virus, which is divergent from all currently known avian-origin parvoviruses and should be a novel duck parvovirus (NDPV).  aPublisher supplied data 3aAnas platyrhynchos 3aAnseriform dependoparvovirus 1 3abeak 3aducks 3adwarfing 3ageese 3ainfectious diseases 3aphylogeny 3apolymerase chain reaction 3asequence analysis 3atransmission electron microscopes 3atransmission electron microscopy 3aviruses 3aChina 0aNovel duck parvovirus 0aCherry Valley ducks 0aVirus isolation 0aGoose parvovirus 0aShort beak and dwarfism syndrome1 aLi, Qi1 aChen, Zongyan1 aLiu, Guangqing0 tInfection, genetics, and evolution.g2016 Oct., v. 44 p.278-280dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12450x1567-13487nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.meegid.2016.07.0203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03189naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100001900184245012500203300001800328506007600346520125400422592002801676506003701704650000801741650001501749650001501764650002101779650002101800650002401821650001301845650002301858650001601881650001501897650002001912650002501932650002901957650002601986650003602012700002402048700002102072700002402093700002302117700001602140700002002156700002102176700002102197700002002218700002502238700002102263700001302284700002502297773017302322856008302495852000902578655001202587IND4481222820221207142546.0120502e20120221xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448122282DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.10188671082doi7 aPMC32869052pmcid7 a219309402pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChiba, Naokazu10aHomeobox B9 induces epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition-associated radioresistance by accelerating DNA damage responses  ap. 2760-2765.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aHomeobox 9 (HOXB9), a nontransforming transcription factor overexpressed in breast cancer, alters tumor cell fate and promotes tumor progression and metastasis. Here we show that HOXB9 confers resistance to ionizing radiation by promoting DNA damage response. In nonirradiated cells, HOXB9 induces spontaneous DNA damage, phosphorylated histone 2AX and p53 binding protein 1 foci, and increases baseline ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) phosphorylation. Upon ionizing radiation, ATM is hyperactivated in HOXB9-expressing cells during the early stages of the double-stranded DNA break (DSB) response, accelerating accumulation of phosphorylated histone 2AX, mediator of DNA-damage checkpoint 1, and p53 binding protein 1, at DSBs and enhances DSB repair. The effect of HOXB9 on the response to ionizing radiation requires the baseline ATM activity before irradiation and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition induced by TGF-β, a HOXB9 transcriptional target. Our results reveal the impact of a HOXB9–TGF-β–ATM axis on checkpoint activation and DNA repair, suggesting that TGF-β may be a key factor that links tumor microenvironment, tumor cell fate, DNA damage response, and radioresistance in a subset of HOXB9-overexpressing breast tumors.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDNA 3aDNA damage 3aDNA repair 3abinding proteins 3abreast neoplasms 3agene overexpression 3ahistones 3aionizing radiation 3airradiation 3ametastasis 3aphosphorylation 3aradiation resistance 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranscription factors 3atransforming growth factor beta1 aComaills, Valentine1 aShiotani, Bunsyo1 aTakahashi, Fumiyuki1 aShimada, Toshiyuki1 aTajima, Ken1 aWinokur, Daniel1 aHayashida, Tetsu1 aWillers, Henning1 aBrachtel, Elena1 aVivanco, Maria d.

Great progress has been made in N2O measurement, but there is a critical need for sensors that can be used to map the spatial variation of N2O emissions over a wide area. In this article, we outline where N2O measurement is required, describe advances that have been made in developing sensitive analytical techniques and review some promising new technologies.

Benth. ex Hook.f. and Strychnos nux-vomica L. nux-vomica against dengue, Chikungunya and Zika vectors  ap. 163-171.  aThis study focused on green engineering of stable metallic silver nanohybrids (AgNPs) using Cleistanthus collinus (Cc) and Strychnos nux-vomica (Sn) plant leaf extracts via microwave irradiation and its bioinsecticidal activity against the mosquito vectors and antimicrobial efficacy against clinically isolated human pathogens. Engineered silver nanohybrids (CcAgNPs and SnAgNPs) were characterized by UV-vis spectroscopy, Fourier Transform Infra-red spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray diffraction spectroscopy (XRD), Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy (FESEM) and Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) analysis. FTIR results showed the role of alcohols, amines, alkanes, and amides in the bioreduction, capping and stabilization of synthesized silver nanoparticles. The XRD analysis confirmed the crystalline structure of the synthesized silver nanohybrids. FESEM results displayed the shape as well as size of the engineered CcAgNPs and SnAgNPs. Interestingly, the synthesized CcAgNPs was found to be triangular and pentagonal shape with 66.27–75.09 nm size and the synthesized SnAgNPs showed irregular, spherical and round shape with 54.45–60.84 nm size. The existence of silver ion signals on engineered nanohybrids at 2.8 to 4 KeV was established by EDX analysis. Further, both C. collinus and S. nux-vomica leaf extracts and engineered CcAgNPs and SnAgNPs showed highest larvicidal activity against Anopheles stephensi and Aedes aegypti fourth instar larvae. The maximum mortality rate (100%) for CcAgNPs was observed at 20 mg/l and 25 mg/l for A. aegypti and A. stephensi vectors respectively, while highest percent of mortality for SnAgNPs was noticed in both A. aegypti and A. stephensi at 25 mg/l. The LC50 dose for CcAgNPs towards A. stephensi and A. aegypti mosquito vectors noticed were 11.05 and 11.38 mg/l, respectively, whereas the LC50 data for SnAgNPs obtained was 8.82 and 7.75 mg/l for A. stephensiand A. aegypti, respectively. The larvicidal activity was positively correlated with the engineered AgNPs exposure. Both CcAgNPs and SnAgNPs found to be effective antimicrobial agent against six human microbial pathogens and these nanohybrids may be considered as effective antibacterial nanodrug. The results strongly suggest that C. collinus and S. nux-vomica plant extracts derived silver nanohybrids can be applied as a natural biolarvicidal compound to vector-control strategy as non-toxic and eco-friendly approach to prohibit Zika, Chikungunya and dengue fever in the future.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAedes aegypti 3aAnopheles stephensi 3aCleistanthus collinus 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aStrychnos nux-vomica 3aX-ray diffraction 3aalcohols 3aalkanes 3aamides 3aamines 3aanimal pathogens 3aanti-infective agents 3aantimicrobial properties 3acorrelation 3acrystal structure 3adengue 3aenergy-dispersive X-ray analysis 3ahumans 3ainsect vectors 3ainstars 3alarvae 3alarvicides 3aleaf extracts 3alethal concentration 50 3amicrowave radiation 3amortality 3ananosilver 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asilver 3asustainable engineering 3atin 3aultraviolet-visible spectroscopy 3avector control 0aBiosynthesis 0aSilver nanoparticles 0aAnopheles 0aAedes 0aMortality 0aMicrowave irradiation 0aAntibacterial1 aRajakumaran, Sankar1 aSenthil-Nathan, Sengottayan1 aGeetha, Natesan1 aVenkatachalam, Perumal0 tPhysiological and molecular plant pathology.g2018 Jan., v. 101 p.163-171dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl39032x0885-57657nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.pmpp.2017.05.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03220naa a2200649 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094024002200136024001900158040001800177100002300195245013200218300001400350506007600364520111900440592002801559506003701587650002601624650001701650650002201667650001301689650002501702650001301727650002401740650001001764650001101774650001901785650002201804650002101826650001201847650001401859650001701873650002101890650003301911650001301944650001101957650001301968653002601981653006402007653003002071653002302101653004602124700001902170700003302189700002502222700002702247700002202274700002002296700002002316700002202336773010302358856008802461852000902549655001202558IND60552042320221207111551.0161019e201401  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055204232DNAL7 a10.1016/j.molbiopara.2014.01.0032doi7 aPMC40221482pmcid7 a245488802pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLinford, Alicia S.10aCrystal structure and putative substrate identification for the Entamoeba histolytica low molecular weight tyrosine phosphatase  ap. 33-44.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aEntamoeba histolytica is a eukaryotic intestinal parasite of humans, and is endemic in developing countries. We have characterized the E. histolytica putative low molecular weight protein tyrosine phosphatase (LMW-PTP). The structure for this amebic tyrosine phosphatase was solved, showing the ligand-induced conformational changes necessary for binding of substrate. In amebae, it was expressed at low but detectable levels as detected by immunoprecipitation followed by immunoblotting. A mutant LMW-PTP protein in which the catalytic cysteine in the active site was replaced with a serine lacked phosphatase activity, and was used to identify a number of trapped putative substrate proteins via mass spectrometry analysis. Seven of these putative substrate protein genes were cloned with an epitope tag and overexpressed in amebae. Five of these seven putative substrate proteins were demonstrated to interact specifically with the mutant LMW-PTP. This is the first biochemical study of a small tyrosine phosphatase in Entamoeba, and sets the stage for understanding its role in amebic biology and pathogenesis.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aEntamoeba histolytica 3aactive sites 3acrystal structure 3acysteine 3adeveloping countries 3aepitopes 3agene overexpression 3agenes 3ahumans 3aimmunoblotting 3amass spectrometry 3amolecular weight 3amutants 3aparasites 3apathogenesis 3aprecipitin tests 3aprotein-tyrosine-phosphatase 3aproteins 3aserine 3atyrosine 0aEntamoeba histolytica 0aLow molecular weight protein tyrosine phosphatase (LMW-PTP) 0aLMW-PTP crystal structure 0aSubstrate-trapping 0aLMW-PTP putative substrate identification1 aJiang, Nona M.1 aEdwards, T.

Arterial stiffness is a pathological vascular change that is associated with higher subsequent risk of CVD. This study aims to investigate the cross-sectional association between diet quality and arterial stiffness, as assessed by brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity (baPWV). Data from the Kailuan Study, a prospective cohort from China, were utilized for these analyses. Baseline data from subjects who were free of CVD were included (n = 22,563). Dietary intake was assessed by a semi-quantitative validated food frequency questionnaire. Diet quality was quantified using the American Heart Association diet score (range 0 to 5), which is based on the consumption of fruits/vegetables, fish, sodium, sweets/sugar-sweetened beverages, and whole grains. Participants were categorized into three groups based on their diet quality: poor (0–1), intermediate (2–3), and ideal quality (4–5). Participants also had baPWV measured. General linear models were used to calculate adjusted means with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) for baPWV across diet quality groups, after adjusting for age, sex, BMI, education level, smoking status, blood pressure, fasting blood glucose, LDL cholesterol, and HDL cholesterol. Logistic regression analysis was used to estimate the odds ratios for arterial stiffness (baPWV ≥ 1400 cm/s) across diet quality categories. Greater diet quality was associated with lower baPWV values (P-trend < 0.001). Adjusted mean baPWV was 1436 cm/s (95% CI: 1417–1454), 1428 cm/s (95% CI: 1408–1447), and 1397 cm/s (95% CI: 1365–1430) for poor, intermediate, and ideal diet quality, respectively. We observed a non-significant inverse trend between diet quality and odds of having arterial stiffness (adjusted OR between two extreme groups = 0.81, 95% CI: 0.61–1.07, P trend = 0.11). In this cross-sectional analysis greater diet quality was associated with lower baPWV values in individuals without CVD.

Traditional methods of identifying species based on fish morphological characteristics are not always practical to unambiguously identify seafood products available for purchase. The use of DNA sequencing for species identification is a reliable alternative to traditional methods like morphological determination, especially when food items have been subject to various forms of processing. Results show a rate of mislabeling among restaurants of 16.3% (28 out of 172 samples) in three regions of the United States. The rate of false labeling is essentially equivalent between these different regions. This study shows the usefulness of targeting the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase I (COI) region to uniquely identify fish and seafood samples from across the United States.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA barcoding 3acytochrome-c oxidase 3afish 3afood technology 3amarkets 3amitochondria 3aproduct authenticity 3aquality control 3arestaurants 3aseafoods 3aspecies identification 3aUnited States 0aDNA barcoding 0aFood authenticity 0aSeafood 0aMislabeling 0aDNA sequencing 0aSpecies identification1 aCarlson, Traci1 aSchaffner, Donald W.1 aGhorashi, Mahni1 aBest, Dieter1 aJandhyala, Srikanth1 aTraverso, Julie1 aAmini, Sasan0 tFood control.g2015 Oct., v. 56 p.71-76dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl56242x0956-71357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodcont.2015.03.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01727naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100002400112245009900136300001600235520065000251592002800901650002300929650001000952650002400962650002200986650001301008650001701021650001601038650001501054650001101069650001401080650001701094653002401111653002101135653000801156653000801164653000701172653000801179700001601187773010501203852000901308655001201317IND60706053520221122232702.0200807e201407  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070605352DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAngadi, Airadevi P.10aGenetic variability in bird of paradise (Strelitzia reginae) genotypes (Vegetative parameters)  ap. 842-846.  aHundred genotypes of bird of paradise (Strelitzia reginae) were evaluated for genetic variability in vegetative parameters.

MutT Homolog 1 (MTH1), a protein enzyme that can help to prevent 8-oxo-dGTP misincorporation, plays critical roles in oxidative stress neutralization, oncogene-associated tumor malignancy, and anticancer therapies. So, in this work, a simple and function-oriented method is developed for the assay of MTH1 activity. Specifically, a mismatch-based (“8-oxoG: A” mismatch) DNA chain elongation strategy (MB-DCE) is firstly proposed to reveal the misincorporation efficiency of 8-oxo-dGTP. Then, further coupled with the inherent activity of MTH1 to prevent 8-oxo-dGTP misincorporation, a relationship can be established to reveal the activity of MTH1 through MB-DCE. As the method is designed directly towards the cellular function of MTH1, activity of MTH1 in different breast cancer cell lines has been detected, implying the potential application of this assay method for biomedical research and clinical diagnose in the future.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aanalytical chemistry 3abiomedical research 3abreast neoplasms 3aneutralization 3aoxidative stress 0aMutT Homolog 1 activity 0aElectrochemical assay 0aOxidative damages 0aDNA chain elongation 0aNucleobase misincorporation1 aGu, Shiyu1 aLiu, Fengzhen1 aLi, Liudi1 aWang, Zhaoxia1 aYang, Jie1 aLi, Genxi0 tAnalytica chimica acta.g2016 Jan. 28, v. 905 p.66-71dElsevier B.V.x0003-26707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aca.2015.12.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03018naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002200139245009500161300001600256500002000272520175400292592002802046650001502074650001502089650002502104650000902129650001202138650001402150650001102164650002402175650002402199700006002223700002802283700002402311700006102335700002202396773011902418856007402537852000902611655001202620IND60772808020221120074422.0220410e202204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077280802DNAL7 a10.1111/vsu.137622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBillas, Alison R.10aIncidence of and risk factors for surgical site infection following canine limb amputation  ap. 418-425.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aOBJECTIVE: To determine the incidence of and risk factors for surgical site infection (SSI) following canine thoracic and pelvic limb amputations. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective, multicenter study. ANIMALS: Dogs (n = 248). METHODS: Medical records were reviewed for preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative variables including indication for amputation, amputation type, method of muscle transection, duration of surgery and anesthesia, and wound classification. Follow up was ≥30 days or until SSI development. Logistic regression and Fisher's exact tests were used to compare SSI incidence to variables of interest. RESULTS: The incidence of SSI was 12.5% for all procedures and 10.9% for clean procedures. Factors increasing odds of SSI were muscle transection with a bipolar vessel sealing device (P = .023 for all procedures, P = .025 for clean procedures), procedure classified as other than clean (P = .003), and indication for amputation of bacterial infection (P = .041) or traumatic injury (P = .003) compared to neoplasia. CONCLUSION: Use of bipolar vessel sealing devices for muscle transection increased the odds of developing an SSI whereas use of electrosurgery and/or sharp transection did not. Dogs with surgical sites that were other than clean, or with bacterial infection and/or traumatic injury were also at increased odds of SSI. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Use of electrosurgery or sharp transection for muscle transection should be considered rather than use of bipolar vessel sealing devices to decrease odds of SSI in dogs undergoing limb amputation. Further studies across a variety of procedures are needed to validate these findings given the increasing popularity of these devices in veterinary medicine.  aPublisher supplied data 3aamputation 3aanesthesia 3abacterial infections 3adogs 3amuscles 3aneoplasms 3apelvis 3aregression analysis 3aveterinary medicine1 aGrimes, Janet A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4554-80131 aHollenbeck, Danielle L.1 aDickerson, Vanna M.1 aWallace, Mandy L.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5286-42871 aSchmiedt, Chad W.0 tVeterinary surgery.g2022 Apr., v. 51, no. 3 p.418-425dJohn Wiley & Sons, Inc.wJournal:jnl10192x0161-34997nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/vsu.137623Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03852naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100003000151245016600181300001600347520180900363592002802172650004402200650002102244650002602265650002602291650002902317650002502346650001702371650002402388650002102412650002202433650002502455650001902480650001402499650001702513650001802530650002102548650002602569650001202595650002402607650001702631650001302648650003302661650002302694650002102717650002302738650001602761653002102777653002102798653002702819653001502846700003302861700002802894700002502922700002702947700002802974773011703002856008603119852000903205655001203214IND60570358020221123020206.0190408e20171201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057035802DNAL7 a10.1016/j.indcrop.2017.06.0582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCardoso, Lucas Guimarães10aDevelopment of active films poly (butylene adipate co-terephthalate) – PBAT incorporated with oregano essential oil and application in fish fillet preservation  ap. 388-397.  aThe food industry has been using antimicrobial active packaging as a tool for maintaining the quality of highly perishable products such as fish products. The use of synthetic materials, though, causes serious environmental impacts due to inappropriate disposal. Therefore, eco-friendly polymer materials from renewable sources stand out as alternatives to reduce such impacts. This study set out to develop biodegradable antimicrobial films comprising poly(butylene adipate-co-terephthalate) (PBAT) and oregano (Origanum vulgare) essential oil (OEO) for application in fish fillet storage. Films were produced by hot-melt extrusion and characterized as to morphological, mechanical, physical, water barrier, and structural properties. Their bioactive, antioxidant, and antimicrobial activities were also analyzed. OEO incorporation did not affect films’ thermal properties, but the mechanical attributes tensile strength, elongation at break, and elastic modulus were impaired. Scanning electron microscopy images indicated heterogeneous, rough surfaces and cross-sections upon OEO addition. The higher the OEO content, the greater the water vapor permeability. Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy corroborated the presence of OEO bioactive compounds in the extruded films. Microbiological assays demonstrated the effectiveness of the films in lessening total coliforms, Staphylococcus aureus and psychrotrophic microorganisms. Concerning antioxidant properties, the higher the OEO concentration, the stronger the antioxidant activity. The films produced here were found to be efficient as an active packaging system to control microbial growth in fish fillets.

We hypothesize that repeated biochar incorporations induce further priming effect in the soil that was already amended with biochar. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two biochars prepared from Miscanthus giganteus at 350 and 700 °C, at a rate of 50 g C kg⁻¹ soil, were added into the soil previously received each biochar separately with a pre-incubation of 1.5 years. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: The second addition of fresh biochar caused 108 and 26.9 μg CO₂-C g⁻¹ soil of soil C losses, which is the same order but less amount (about 72 and 56%) of C losses as the first biochar addition. This might be due to the depleted soil C after 1.5 years of incubation. Also, it might be attributed to the altered soil microbial community with lower proportions (%) of gram-positive bacteria, and higher proportions of fungi, actinobacteria and gram-negative bacterial phospholipid fatty acids (PLFAs) with repeated biochar addition. CONCLUSIONS: Our research provided insights into the second addition of biochar-induced priming effects and responsible PLFAs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aActinobacteria 3aGram-negative bacteria 3aGram-positive bacteria 3aMiscanthus giganteus 3abiochar 3acarbon 3afungi 3aphospholipid fatty acids 3asoil 3asoil microorganisms1 aLin, Qimei1 aDurenkamp, Mark1 aKuzyakov, Yakov0 tJournal of soils and sediments.g2018 Jan., v. 18, no. 1 p.128-135dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl3949862x1439-01087nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11368-017-1705-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02385naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100006900152245016900221300001400390520105200404592002801456650001701484650001301501650001401514650001501528650002001543650002901563650004401592653001701636653001401653653002701667653001601694653004101710700002901751700003001780773009301810856008701903852000901990655001201999IND60543110720221120192308.0190408e201510  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054311072DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodcont.2015.03.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHoyos Ossa, Duvan Esteban1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3075-792310aDetermination of aflatoxin M1 in ice cream samples using immunoaffinity columns and ultra-high performance liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry  ap. 34-40.  aIn this work, a highly sensitive method was developed for the selective determination of aflatoxin M1 mycotoxin in ice cream samples using ultra high performance liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS). The low detection values required, of μg/kg, made necessary sample concentration and cleaning using highly targeted immunoaffinity columns for this compound after extraction from matrix using a phosphate buffered saline solution (PBS). Method validation was carried out for ice cream matrix by means of recovery experiments using fortified samples near to the lower end of the calibration curve and a higher level. All recoveries were found in the range of 70–120 % with % RSD less than 25%. Quantitation was performed using external calibration with standards prepared in mobile phase. Validated method was used to determine the content of AFM1 in samples of ice cream bought in local stores. Compound identification was performed using the quantitation/qualification ratios for monitored transitions (Q/q1 and Q/q2).  aPublisher supplied data 3aaflatoxin M1 3acleaning 3aice cream 3aphosphates 3asodium chloride 3atandem mass spectrometry 3aultra-performance liquid chromatography 0aAflatoxin M1 0aIce cream 0aImmunoaffinity columns 0aUHPLC-MS/MS 0aAflatoxin M1 (PubChem CID: 15558498)1 aHincapié, Diego Alfonso1 aPeñuela, Gustavo Antonio0 tFood control.g2015 Oct., v. 56 p.34-40dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl56242x0956-71357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodcont.2015.03.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02778naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001400148245015300162300001400315520136000329592002801689650002501717650002401742650001701766650001001783650001401793650002301807650001501830650001101845650001801856650003101874650001801905650002601923653002101949653002101970653003301991653001602024700001302040700002202053700002002075773014602095856008202241852000902323655001202332IND60679770120221122154903.0200320e202003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067977012DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fshw.2019.12.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCai, Yidi10aImpact of particle size of pulverized citrus peel tissue on changes in antioxidant properties of digested fluids during simulated in vitro digestion  ap. 58-63.  aTo examine the effect of mechanical processing for plant-based materials on antioxidant properties during digestion, relationships between the size of pulverized plant tissue and changes in antioxidant activities during simulated in vitro digestion were investigated. The citrus peel tissue was pulverized and classified into four powder fractions followed their particle size distributions as 125 − 180 μm, 180 − 355 μm, 355 − 500 μm and 500 − 710 μm. These fractions were regarded as a plant tissue model with various degrees of cell damages. Powder samples were collected during the digestion and measured their particle sizes and colors. Besides, total phenolic content and antioxidant activities of digested fluid were also evaluated. The results showed that the powder color of smaller particles were significantly changed than the bigger ones. The bio-properties of digested fluid for the bigger particle sizes comparatively retained more than smaller ones at the simulated gastric stage. It also showed mostly stable during simulated gastric or small intestinal digestion stage. This suggested that the release of bioactive compounds from plant tissues during digestion could be related to their structural attributes such as degrees of cell damages which could be affected by processing methods and conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantioxidant activity 3abioactive compounds 3acitrus peels 3acolor 3adigestion 3ain vitro digestion 3aintestines 3amodels 3aparticle size 3aparticle size distribution 3aplant tissues 3aprocessing technology 0aPlant-based food 0aTissue structure 0aSimulated in vitro digestion 0aCell matrix1 aQin, Wei1 aKetnawa, Sunantha1 aOgawa, Yukiharu0 tFood science and human wellness.g2020 Mar., v. 9, no. 1 p.58-63dElsevier B.V.aKeAi Communications Co., LtdwJournal:23299x2213-45307nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fshw.2019.12.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02381naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245008100172300001600253520087700269592002801146650001301174650001101187650001401198650001901212650002701231650002401258650001301282650001301295650001601308650002201324650002501346650001801371650001101389650001901400650001101419650001801430650001601448653002101464653001601485653002401501653001901525653001201544700002301556700001701579700001701596700002601613773011701639856008601756852000901842655001201851IND60570358220221122021255.0190408e20171201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057035822DNAL7 a10.1016/j.indcrop.2017.06.0622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSjöblom, Magnus10aDirect electricity generation from sweet sorghum stalks and anaerobic sludge  ap. 505-511.  aDried sweet sorghum stalks were valorized as a raw material for electricity generation in a two chamber microbial fuel cell using anaerobic sludge from a biogas plant as inoculum. The maximum voltage obtained on the sorghum stalks at an operating temperature of 35°C was 546mV with a maximum power- and current density of 131mW/m2 and 543mA/m2, respectively. The coulombic efficiency was 2.2%. Polarization data indicated that Ohmic resistances were dominant with an internal resistance of 182Ω. The total electrical energy per gram of dried sorghum stalks was 165J/g. Enzymatic treatment of the sorghum stalks did not improve the total electrical energy obtained.

This work aimed to characterize phosphates contents in seafood products from the Portuguese market. Almost 900 samples of unprocessed and processed species of crustaceans, molluscs, and fish were analyzed at the Portuguese Institute for the Sea and Atmosphere over a 15 years’ time period. Considering processed products, crab sticks presented the lowest average values of total phosphates, while salted and dry cod, hake and shrimp evidenced the highest variations. Phosphates contents in unprocessed samples varied among species, being the lowest and highest average values observed for octopus and sardine, respectively. New reference phosphate limits were defined which permits verifying if the legislation is followed with respect to phosphates added to seafood. Moreover, the reference conversion factor is not adequate for seafood, and thus new factors were proposed. Overall, the addition of phosphates has not been a current practice. Nevertheless, for an easier control and to avoid the need of laborious sampling to establish natural phosphates levels, it would be more appropriate to define limits with respect to total phosphates contents.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCrustacea 3acrabs 3ahake 3alaws and regulations 3amarkets 3amolluscs 3aphosphates 3asardines 3aseafoods 3ashrimp 0aFood analysis 0aFood composition 0aPhosphates 0aSeafood 0aData collection 0aFish 0aCrustacean 0aMolluscs 0aAdditives1 aVieira, Helena1 aLourenço, Helena1 aGonc̦alves, Susana,1 aMartins, Maria Fernanda1 aMendes, Rogério0 tJournal of food composition and analysis.g2017 Sept., v. 62 p.94-102dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl42192x0889-15757nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jfca.2017.05.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01674naa a2200241 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100006300142245007800205300002000283520081100303592002801114650001601142650001401158650001301172773014901185856007701334852000901411655001201420IND60759337620221117223322.0211208e20211117xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075933762DNAL7 a10.1021/jacs.1c108452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStephan, Douglas W.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8140-835510aDiverse Uses of the Reaction of Frustrated Lewis Pair (FLP) with Hydrogen  ap. 20002-20014.  aThe articulation of the notion of “frustrated Lewis pairs” (FLPs) emerged from the discovery that H₂ can be reversibly activated by combinations of sterically encumbered main group Lewis acids and bases. This has prompted numerous studies focused on various perturbations of the Lewis acid/base combinations and the applications to organic reductions. This Perspective focuses on the new directions and developments that are emerging from this FLP chemistry involving hydrogen. Three areas are discussed including new applications and approaches to FLP reductions, the reductions of small molecules, and the advances in heterogeneous FLP systems. These foci serve to illustrate that despite having its roots in main group chemistry, this simple concept of FLPs is being applied across the discipline.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLewis acids 3achemistry 3ahydrogen0 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2021 Nov. 17, v. 143, no. 48 p.20002-20014dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19166x1520-51267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jacs.1c108453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02809naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100006300142245015400205500002000359520137000379592002801749596005501777596005501832650001901887650001501906650001001921650002501931650001301956650001301969650001401982650001501996650002502011650001302036700002102049700005702070700006202127773013602189856007702325852000902402655001202411IND60773202320221119075646.0220412e202107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077320232DNAL7 a10.1029/2021JB0219662doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBelgrano, Thomas M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2160-189510aPaleobathymetry of Submarine Lavas in the Samail and Troodos Ophiolites: Insights From Volatiles in Glasses and Implications for Hydrothermal Systems  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aHydrostatic pressure exerted by the ocean water column fundamentally influences magmatic and hydrothermal processes in submarine volcanic settings and is therefore an important parameter to know when investigating such processes. Currently, there are few reliable methods for reconstructing past ocean depths for ancient volcanic terranes. Here, we develop and test an empirically calibrated statistical approach for determining paleodepths of eruption from the concentrations of H₂O and CO₂ dissolved in volcanic glasses, utilizing the well‐defined pressure‐dependent solubility of these volatiles in silicate melts. By comparing newly determined and published glass compositions from the Samail and Troodos ophiolites with sedimentary and fluid inclusion evidence, we propose that the Samail lavas erupted at ocean depths of ∼3.4 km, and the Troodos lavas at ∼4.1 km. These depths are 1–2 km deeper than those assumed in most previous studies of hydrothermal activity in the two ophiolites. These high depths imply high hydrostatic pressures within the underlying oceanic crust. Such pressures may have allowed convecting hydrothermal fluids to attain significantly higher temperatures (e.g., >450°C) than in typical modern ocean ridge hydrothermal systems during metal leaching in the crust and metal precipitation in seafloor sulfide deposits.  aPublisher supplied data  aP2BEP2‐191795cSwiss National Science Foundation  a200020‐169653cSwiss National Science Foundation 3acarbon dioxide 3ageophysics 3aglass 3ahydrostatic pressure 3aresearch 3aseawater 3asilicates 3asolubility 3astatistical analysis 3asulfides1 aTollan, Peter M.1 aMarxer, Felix1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1797-65981 aDiamond, Larryn W.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1599-22010 tJournal of geophysical research.g2021 July, v. 126, no. 7 p.e2021JB021966-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:27943x2169-93137nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2021JB0219663Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03074naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245015300169300001600322520166200338592002802000650002102028650001002049650001102059650001702070650001402087650002202101650001302123650001502136650002602151650001802177650001502195650001702210650004402227653002702271653001302298653002102311653001702332700001602349700001702365700001802382700001702400773009202417856008602509852000902595655001202604IND60585762220221120022204.0201025e20180201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058576222DNAL7 a10.1016/j.talanta.2017.09.0532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhong, Zhihui10aComparative proteomics of cancer stem cells in osteosarcoma using ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography and Orbitrap Fusion mass spectrometer  ap. 362-368.  aOsteosarcoma is the most common malignant tumour found in bones, and it has a poor prognosis. For improved therapy, it is significant to have a deep understanding of the proteomics changes in the cancer stem cells (CSCs) of osteosarcoma. Therefore, a comparative proteomics approach based on ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography coupled to an Orbitrap Fusion mass spectrometer (UHPLC-Orbitrap Fusion MS) was established to investigate the key molecular changes between CSCs and non-CSCs in human osteosarcoma HOS cells. A proteomic analysis was performed on these samples and a total of more than 6600 proteins were identified in each run. Moreover, most of the correlation coefficients between three biological repeats were more than 0.9 in each group. That finding demonstrated not only that the reproducibility of the test is good but also that the stability of this MS is excellent. A label-free quantitative method was applied to analyse differentially expressed proteins. Using the criteria of greater than 1.5-fold changes and a p value < 0.05, 124 proteins were identified as being significantly different between HOS-CSCs and non-CSCs. A pathway analysis of differentially expressed proteins by Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) revealed the potential molecular regulatory networks that may regulate CSCs. Selected differential α-actinin 4 (ACTN4) proteins were validated by Western blot assay. These findings enhance our understanding of the molecular changes in CSCs and may provide additional improvements in therapy for treating osteosarcoma. Moreover, the UHPLC-Orbitrap Fusion MS-based proteomics method is helpful in cancer research.  aPublisher supplied data 3aWestern blotting 3abones 3ahumans 3aosteosarcoma 3aprognosis 3aprotein synthesis 3aproteins 3aproteomics 3aquantitative analysis 3aspectrometers 3astem cells 3atherapeutics 3aultra-performance liquid chromatography 0aComparative proteomics 0aLC-MS/MS 0aCancer stem cell 0aOsteosarcoma1 aMao, Sifeng1 aLin, Haifeng1 aLin, Jin-Ming1 aLin, Jianhua0 tTalanta.g2018 Feb. 01, v. 178 p.362-368dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11742x0039-91407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.talanta.2017.09.0533Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01528naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100002200137245010700159300001600266500002000282520055200302592002800854650002700882650001100909650001500920650002300935650001100958700003400969773014301003856007101146852000901217655001201226IND60680231020221119163250.0200104e197011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068023102DNAL7 a10.2307/12372592doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVandeputte, J.

For the overwhelming majority of cases, the elemental analysis of fruit juices is carried out using spectrochemical analytical methods, which normally require samples of fruit juices to be prepared by decomposing their organic matrix and releasing elements in a form suitable for measurement. This review covers different aspects of the elemental analysis of fruit juices and the societal implications related to the presence of various elements in these beverages.

Previous studies have reported apparent lower N₂O emissions from dairy cow urine from fodder beet plants than from kale plants, although the underpinning mechanisms were poorly understood. Here, we report a laboratory incubation study to improve understanding of possible mechanisms underpinning different N₂O emissions from two different forage plants, fodder beet (FB) and kale. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The treatments included two urine sources from cows grazing FB or kale and two soils (FB soil and kale soil): FB soil control, FB soil + FB urine, FB soil + kale urine, kale soil control, kale soil + FB urine and kale soil + kale urine. The incubation temperature was 10 °C to simulate New Zealand autumn/winter soil temperatures. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Results showed that the total N₂O emissions from FB urine treatment and from urine treatments in the FB soil were lower than those from kale urine in the kale soil (P < 0.05). There was a delay in the ammonia-oxidising bacteria (AOB) growth in the FB soil + urine compared with that in kale soil with urine and this led to slower ammonia oxidation in the FB soil. Denitrifier communities were not significantly affected by the urine or soil treatments. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that there are plant secondary metabolites (PSMs) in the FB urine or root exudates in the FB soil, which might have inhibited the AOB growth and the nitrification process which led to lower N₂O emissions in the FB soil or urine. Further research is needed to determine the chemical composition of urine from different forage plants and to identify potential PSMs or root exudates in the urine or soil from different forage plants.  aPublisher supplied data 3aammonia 3aautumn 3achemical composition 3adairy cows 3adenitrification 3adenitrifying microorganisms 3aforage 3agrazing 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3agreenhouse gases 3akale 3anitrification 3anitrifying bacteria 3anitrous oxide 3aoxidation 3aroot exudates 3asecondary metabolites 3asoil temperature 3asoil treatment 3aurine 3awinter 3aNew Zealand1 aDi, HongJie1http://orcid.org/0000-0002-6966-02991 aCameron, KeithC.1 aPodolyan, Andriy1 aShen, Jupei1 aHe, Jizheng0 tJournal of soils and sediments.g2018 Jan., v. 18, no. 1 p.85-93dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl3949862x1439-01087nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11368-017-1780-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01505naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100002100137245004800158300001600206500002000222520057700242592002800819650002700847650001200874650002500886650001700911650001700928650001100945650001200956773014300968856007101111852000901182655001201191IND60680231120221119163053.0200104e197011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068023112DNAL7 a10.2307/12372582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHerdt, Robert W.12aA Disaggregate Approach to Aggregate Supply  ap. 512-520.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aAnalyses of aggregate supply response in low‐income countries are practically nonexistent because of the index number problems and the difficulty of accounting for the effect of weather inherent in aggregate approaches.

A Greek rural watershed located in Central Greece (Region of Thessaly) is used as a case study application. A common hydro-economic framework for sustainable water resources management in irrigated agriculture is examined, aiming to provide a simple and understandable tool for policymakers. In this framework two hydro-economic models (HEMs) were developed to address challenges regarding data limitations, spatial analysis, and scenario-based problems (e.g. agri-economic scenarios, water policy scenarios, environmental scenarios, etc.). A set of selection criteria was then used to qualitatively compare these two models, based on their advantages and disadvantages. The results of this analysis indicate that HEMs’ development must be quite flexible about their settings and must take into consideration the desired accuracy level that is likely to satisfy their main purpose/goal. The optimal approach is the one that can achieve a balance between simplicity, flexibility, accuracy and robustness.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase studies 3airrigated farming 3awater 3awater management 3awater policy 3awatersheds 3aGreece1 aLatinopoulos, D.1 aLoukas, A.1 aMylopoulos, N.0 tWater resources management.g2020 Nov., v. 34, no. 14 p.4511-4526dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl44305x0920-47417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11269-020-02690-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02592naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245016300163300001400326520116100340592002801501650002501529650001601554650001801570650001101588650001901599650000901618650002201627650002201649650001301671650001501684650002701699650001301726653003901739653003201778653001801810653002001828653002201848700001601870700001701886700002001903700001901923773009001942856008102032852000902113655001202122IND60528533320221118143626.0160716e20160211xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052853332DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aca.2015.12.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Jiaxi10aFacile synthesis of hydrophilic polyamidoxime polymers as a novel solid-phase extraction matrix for sequential characterization of glyco- and phosphoproteomes  ap. 69-76.  aSelective enrichment of glycopeptides or phosphopeptides with great biological significance is essential for high-throughput mass spectrometry analysis. However, most previously reported methods only focused on enriching either glycopeptides or phosphopeptides rather than enriching them both. In this work, for the first time, a facile route was developed for the synthesis of polyamidoxime polymers with intrinsic hydrophilic skeletons and attractive long chain structure. The polyamidoxime materials (co-PAN) were synthesized from polyacrylonitrile (PAN) precursor and were successfully used for selective enrichment of glycopeptides. After that, co-PAN as a matrix functionalized with titanium ions (co-PAN@Ti4+) could efficiently enrich phosphopeptides. The performances of the polymers for sequential selective and effective enrichment of glycopeptides and phosphopeptides were evaluated with standard peptide mixtures and human serum. Moreover, the efficiency of enrichment of the material was still retained after being used repeatedly. These results demonstrated that the polymers showed great potential in the practical application of proteomics.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanalytical chemistry 3ablood serum 3aglycopeptides 3ahumans 3ahydrophilicity 3aions 3amass spectrometry 3apolyacrylonitrile 3aproteome 3aproteomics 3asolid phase extraction 3atitanium 0aHydrophilic polyamidoxime polymers 0aSequential characterization 0aGlycopeptides 0aPhosphopeptides 0aMass spectrometry1 aWang, Yanan1 aGao, Mingxia1 aZhang, Xiangmin1 aYang, Pengyuan0 tAnalytica chimica acta.g2016 Feb. 11, v. 907 p.69-76dElsevier B.V.x0003-26707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aca.2015.12.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01999naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100005700151245009000208300001800298520079300316592002801109650001701137650001501154650002101169650001701190650001701207650002201224653000901246653001201255653001401267700001701281700002801298700006401326700002401390773011601414856008601530852000901616655001201625IND60748086720221119202602.0211106e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074808672DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tplants.2021.07.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMishra, Vipul1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7310-816810aNitric oxide and hydrogen sulfide: an indispensable combination for plant functioning  ap. 1270-1285.  aNitric oxide (NO) and hydrogen sulfide (H₂S) are gasotransmitters, which are involved in almost all plant physiological and stress-related processes. With its antioxidant regulatory properties, NO on its own ameliorates plant stress, while H₂S, a foul-smelling gas, has differential effects. Recent studies have shown that these signaling molecules are involved in intertwined pathway networks. This is due to the contrasting effects of NO and H₂S depending on cell type, subcellular compartment, and redox status, as well as the flux and dosage of NO and H₂S in different plant species and cellular contexts. Here, we provide a comprehensive review of the complex networks of these molecules, with particular emphasis on root development, stomatal movement, and plant cell death.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantioxidants 3acell death 3ahydrogen sulfide 3anitric oxide 3aplant stress 3astomatal movement 0aroot 0astomata 0acrosstalk1 aSingh, Pooja1 aTripathi, Durgesh Kumar1 aCorpas, Francisco J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1814-92121 aSingh, Vijay Pratap0 tTrends in plant science.g2021 Dec., v. 26, no. 12 p.1270-1285dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl53669x1360-13857nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tplants.2021.07.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02107naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001200143245011800155300001600273520115300289592002801442650002201470650001001492650001301502650001401515650001201529700001401541700002501555700001401580700001501594773011901609856004401728852000901772655001201781IND50073151520221121230249.0140410e200109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007315152DNAL7 a10.1007/s0021601009912doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLin, S.10aMicrosized 2D protein arrays immobilized by micro-stamps and micro-wells for disease diagnosis and drug screening  ap. 202-208.  aA novel method of protein array immobilization, using micro stamps to pick up proteins from micro wells and deposit them on to a bio-absorption chip, has been developed. This method can potentially transfer several protein spots on to an organized array for applications such as disease diagnosis and drug screening by parallel biological or chemical processes. Fabrication of the micro stamp and the micro well arrays involves thick-photoresist lithography, bulk micromachining, and a molding process, whereas fabrication of the bio-absorption chip involves amino-modification by use of APTS (aminopropyltrimethoxysilane) and surface activation by use of BS³ (bis-sulfosuccinimidyl suberate). Successful transfer of protein on to the bio-absorption surface using the micro stamp-well array has been demonstrated. The size variation between different stamping spots has been shown to be less than 10%, and the APTS–BS³ surface has also been proved to bind the protein efficiently. Appreciable protein retention was achieved during 6-h washing, which shows the binding strength of the bio-absorption surface is sufficient for protein processing.  aPublisher supplied data 3adisease diagnosis 3adrugs 3aproteins 3ascreening 3awashing1 aTseng, F.1 aHuang, H.q(Hanson),1 aHuang, C.1 aChieng, C.0 tFresenius' journal of analytical chemistry.g2001 Sept., v. 371, no. 2 p.202-208dSpringer-Verlagx0937-06337nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s002160100991  aDNAL 7aarticle02945naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002000155245009300175300001300268520137200281592002801653650001101681650001501692650002201707650002501729650001601754650001401770650000901784650002601793650001101819650002201830650001401852650001201866650000901878650002101887650001501908650001301923650002301936650001201959651001101971653002301982653001102005653001702016653001102033653001502044700001802059700001402077700001402091700001802105700001602123700002402139773010502163856009002268852000902358655001202367IND60569161020221116171057.0190405e201708  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056916102DNAL7 a10.1016/j.smallrumres.2017.05.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLôbo, A.M.B.O.10aCharacterization of milk production and composition of four exotic goat breeds in Brazil  ap. 9-16.  aMilk production traits, milk composition and somatic cell count (SCC) from exotic dairy goats were characterized in tropical climate using data from Dairy Goats Breeding Program. The breeds analyzed are distributed in two regions of Brazil (Southeast and Northeast). The Alpine, Saanen and Toggenburg (raised in Southeast) breeds were compared among themselves and with the breeds of Northeast (Anglo Nubian and Saanen). This study demonstrated that milk yield, 305-day lactation yield, lactation length and daily milk yield were influenced by the genetic of animal (breed) and the environmental conditions, such as flock, month and year of production. These same effects affected the milk composition and SCC which also were influenced by physiological stages of the does (lactation and test-day milk order). There were differences in milk composition between the breeds. This may be a result of diet and chemical composition of the pasture feeding the animals, as well as others genetic and environmental factors. The global averages for proportion of lactose were below of the minimum limits established by the Brazilian Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock and Food Supply. The average of SCC was above one million of cells/mL. This study is the first work of characterization of exotic breeds in tropical climate with a database derived of official milk recording.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSaanen 3aToggenburg 3abreeding programs 3achemical composition 3adairy goats 3adatabases 3adiet 3aenvironmental factors 3aflocks 3afood availability 3alactation 3alactose 3amilk 3amilk composition 3amilk yield 3apastures 3asomatic cell count 3atropics 3aBrazil 0aLactose proportion 0aAlpine 0aAnglo Nubian 0aSaanen 0aToggenburg1 aLôbo, R.N.B.1 aFacó, O.1 aSouza, V.1 aAlves, A.A.C.1 aCosta, A.C.1 aAlbuquerque, M.A.M.0 tSmall ruminant research.g2017 Aug., v. 153 p.9-16dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl44843x0921-44887nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.smallrumres.2017.05.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02040naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100006000151245009200211300001400303520082400317592002801141650001201169650001301181650001501194653002101209653001401230653002501244653001601269653001601285700006401301700006401365700005501429773011101484856008601595852000901681655001201690IND60748086920221119202526.0211219e202201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074808692DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tplants.2021.07.0182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKoseoglou, Eleni1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4906-780710aSusceptibility reversed: modified plant susceptibility genes for resistance to bacteria  ap. 69-79.  aPlants have evolved complex defence mechanisms to avoid invasion of potential pathogens. Despite this, adapted pathogens deploy effector proteins to manipulate host susceptibility (S) genes, rendering plant defences ineffective. The identification and mutation of plant S genes exploited by bacterial pathogens are important for the generation of crops with durable and broad-spectrum resistance. Application of mutant S genes in the breeding of resistant crops is limited because of potential pleiotropy. New genome editing techniques open up new possibilities for the modification of S genes. In this review, we focus on S genes manipulated by bacteria and propose ways for their identification and precise modification. Finally, we propose that genes coding for transporter proteins represent a new group of S genes.  aPublisher supplied data 3amutants 3amutation 3apleiotropy 0aeffector targets 0aeffectors 0arecessive resistance 0amutagenesis 0aCRISPR/Cas91 avan der Wolf, Jan M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9196-54191 aVisser, Richard G.F.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0213-40161 aBai, Yuling1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9382-65510 tTrends in plant science.g2022 Jan., v. 27, no. 1 p.69-79dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl53669x1360-13857nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tplants.2021.07.0183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03494naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245017300168520186500341592002802206650001802234650001502252650002402267650001202291650001702303650001702320650001902337650002202356650001402378650002202392650002102414650001402435650001102449650002602460650001802486650002102504650002802525650001902553650001802572650001402590650001802604653002002622653001602642653002602658653000902684700001702693700001902710773014102729856008502870852000902955655001202964IND60679770920221122182948.0200318e202003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067977092DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jarmap.2019.1002372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPark, Song-Yi10aManipulating light quality to promote shoot growth and bioactive compound biosynthesis of Crepidiastrum denticulatum (Houtt.) Pak & Kawano cultivated in plant factories  aCrepidiastrum denticulatum (Korean common name: i-go-deul-ppae-gi) is a valuable medicinal plant used in the pharmaceutical industry and as a raw material of functional foods. In this study, we investigated the effect of light quality on C. denticulatum growth, with the goal of improving the species’ biomass and bioactive compound content when grown in plant factories with artificial lighting. Three-week-old seedlings were grown for 6 weeks in a plant factory under fluorescent lamps (control) and various sets of light-emitting diodes (LEDs): three monochromatic [red (R), green (G), and blue (B)], several dichromatic RB with different ratios of R and B [R:B = 6:4 (R6B4), 7:3 (R7B3), 8:2 (R8B2), and 9:1 (R9B1)], and several trichromatic RGB [R:G:B = 5:1:4 (R5G1B4), 6:1:3 (R6G1B3), 7:1:2 (R7G1B2), 8:1:1 (R8G1B1), and 9:1:0 (R9G1B0)]. Shoot biomass (fresh weight), leaf area, leaf shape index, and water content of the shoot were significantly higher in the RGB group than in the monochromatic and RB groups. Increasing the percentage of R light improved shoot growth in the presence of G light, as in the RGB group, and this was accompanied by a high photosynthetic rate, light absorbance rate, and electron transport rate. The contents of total phenolics and hydroxycinnamic acids per unit dry weight did not differ between plants subjected to the different light quality treatments, and the contents per shoot were thus positively associated with shoot biomass. Overall, R8G1B1 was the most effective treatment for increasing shoot biomass and the accumulation of bioactive compounds; the shoot fresh weight and total hydroxycinnamic content of R8G1B1 were significantly higher, by 50 % and 60 %, respectively, than those of the control. Thus, light quality affects the biosynthesis of bioactive compounds and the shoot biomass of C. denticulatum.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCrepidiastrum 3aabsorbance 3abioactive compounds 3abiomass 3abiosynthesis 3acommon names 3acoumaric acids 3aelectron transfer 3afactories 3afluorescent lamps 3afunctional foods 3aleaf area 3aleaves 3alight emitting diodes 3alight quality 3amedicinal plants 3apharmaceutical industry 3aphotosynthesis 3araw materials 3aseedlings 3awater content 0aAbsorbance rate 0aGreen light 0aHydroxycinnamic acids 0aLEDs1 aBae, Ji-Hoon1 aOh, Myung Min,0 tJournal of applied research on medicinal and aromatic plants.g2020 Mar., v. 16 p.100237-dElsevier GmbHwJournal:23209x2214-78617nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jarmap.2019.1002373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01865naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100007000148245006100218300001100279500001100290520063600301592002800937596005500965596005501020650001701075650002001092650001301112650002101125650001301146650001201159650001501171650001801186650001101204700002401215700002101239773012701260856008301387852000901470655001201479IND60759341420221121234643.0220312e202201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075934142DNAL7 a10.1007/s00203-021-02610-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBontemps-Gallo, Sébastien1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1834-541610aWhat do we know about osmoadaptation of Yersinia pestis?  ap. 11.  aReview  aThe plague agent Yersinia pestis mainly spreads among mammalian hosts and their associated fleas. Production of a successful mammal–flea–mammal life cycle implies that Y. pestis senses and responds to distinct cues in both host and vector. Among these cues, osmolarity is a fundamental parameter. The plague bacillus lives in a tightly regulated environment in the mammalian host, while osmolarity fluctuates in the flea gut (300–550 mOsM). Here, we review the mechanisms that enable Y. pestis to perceive fluctuations in osmolarity, as well as genomic plasticity and physiological adaptation of the bacterium to this stress.  aPublisher supplied data  aANR-15-CE39-0017cAgence Nationale de la Recherche  aANR-16-IDEX-0004cAgence Nationale de la Recherche 3aSiphonaptera 3aYersinia pestis 3abacteria 3adigestive system 3agenomics 3amammals 3aosmolarity 3aosmotolerance 3aplague1 aLacroix, Jean-Marie1 aSebbane, Florent0 tArchives of microbiology.g2022 Jan., v. 204, no. 1 p.11-11dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl49610x0302-89337nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00203-021-02610-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03961naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245006800170520239000238592002802628650002002656650001302676650002002689650001402709650002402723650001402747650002502761650001402786650001502800650002202815650001802837650001102855650002502866650001002891651001802901700002102919700001902940700001902959700001602978700002902994700002003023700002103043700001803064700002003082700002003102700002503122700001903147700002503166773013403191856008503325852000903410655001203419IND60672779820221120065627.0191017e20190613xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067277982DNAL7 a10.1093/cdn/nzz039.P18-033-192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMumford, Sunni10aPreconception Marijuana Use and Pregnancy Outcomes (P18-033-19)  aMarijuana is the most widely used and fastest growing drug in the United States, with legislation currently broadening legalization for both medical and recreational use. However, there are limited data evaluating associations with fecundity and adverse pregnancy outcomes. A few studies evaluating self-reported use suggest marijuana may not be harmful for pregnancy, yet there is a concern for underreporting due to stigma as marijuana is not universally legalized. Our aim was to examine the association between preconception marijuana use, using both self-reported and urinary levels of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), and fecundability, live birth, and pregnancy loss. Women aged 18–40 years old (n = 1212) enrolled in the EAGeR trial were screened for urinary THC at up to 2 time points during preconception using a homogenous enzyme immunoassay from Randox Laboratories, and asked at baseline to report any marijuana use during the past year. Women were followed for up to 6 months while attempting pregnancy. Cox proportional hazard regression was used to calculate fecundability odds ratios (FOR), and log-binomial regression to estimate risk ratios (RR) for live birth and pregnancy loss adjusting for age, race, BMI, education, smoking, alcohol, and detectable levels of opioids. 33 (2.7%) women screened positive for THC during the preconception period, of which 14 also self-reported use during the past year. 62 women (5.1%) either screened positive or self-reported use. Women who screened positive for preconception THC had reduced fecundability (FOR 0.50; 95% CI 0.25, 1.00), as well as women who self-reported marijuana use (FOR 0.54; 95% CI 0.31, 0.94), or who were positive using either urinary or self-report (FOR 0.53, 95% CI 0.33, 0.86). No associations were observed between marijuana use and live birth (RR 0.71; 95% CI 0.41, 1.22) and pregnancy loss (RR 0.78; 95% CI 0.28, 2.18). Women who screened positive for THC during preconception, or self-reported use during the past year had reduced fecundability, though no associations were observed with live birth or pregnancy loss. Further investigations are needed to determine what duration and dose of marijuana may negatively impact fecundability.

The up‐slope normal faults in such salt tectonics systems are often associated with the pinch‐out edge of the buried salt layer. Although the spatial correlation between the normal faults and the salt pinch‐out was previously observed, the mechanism was not fully explained. The Levant basin, which is a young and mildly deformed salt basin with a relatively thin overburden, provides an opportunity to analyze a simple salt tectonics system driven by basin margin tilt, and the formation of the normal faults. This work presents analytical and numerical modeling of the coupled viscous salt and overlying visco‐plastic sediment layer. Results suggest the viscosities of both the sediment overburden and salt, as well as their thicknesses, control the deformation of the coupled layers. The visco‐plastic deformation mechanism explains quantitatively the position of faulting and observations of the temporal evolution of brittle deformation in the Levant basin margin. It predicts that the largest stress in the overburden arises above the salt edge, driving normal faulting at that location. Our model also places quantitative constraints on the effective viscosity of the overburden (>2 × 10²⁰ Pa s), which is consistent with experimentally‐determined creep laws. Our results contribute to the understanding of halokinematics in salt basins during the early stages of deformation and will allow better assessment of geological hazards related to salt related deformation.  aPublisher supplied data  a910/17cISF  a19‐21114YcThe Czech Science Foundation (GA CR)  cIsrael National Committee for Earthquake Preparedness 3abasins 3abrittleness 3adeformation 3ageophysics 3aresearch 3asediments 3atectonics 3aviscosity1 aAharonov, Einat1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8470-26451 aOlive, Jean‐Arthur1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6899-592X1 aParez, Stanislav1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8810-30281 aGvirtzman, Zohar0 tJournal of geophysical research.g2021 July, v. 126, no. 7 p.e2020JB021503-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:27943x2169-93137nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2020JB0215033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02939naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001500142245013000157300002000287520163600307592002801943650002401971650001201995650002202007650002502029700001702054700002102071700001302092700002002105700001402125700001602139700001402155700001502169700001702184700001902201700001402220700006002234773014902294856007702443852000902520655001202529IND60759335420221117222926.0211208e20211123xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075933542DNAL7 a10.1021/jacs.1c097352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Weiwei10aMetallization and Superconductivity in the van der Waals Compound CuP₂Se through Pressure-Tuning of the Interlayer Coupling  ap. 20343-20355.  aEmergent layered Cu-bearing van der Waals (vdW) compounds have great potentials for use in electrocatalysis, lithium batteries, and electronic and optoelectronic devices. However, many of their alluring properties such as potential superconductivity remain unknown. In this work, using CuP₂Se as a model compound, we explored its electrical transport and structural evolution at pressures up to ∼60 GPa using both experimental determinations and ab initio calculations. We found that CuP₂Se undergoes a semiconductor-to-metal transition at ∼20 GPa at room temperature and a metal-to-superconductor transition at 3.3–5.7 K in the pressure range from 27.0 to 61.4 GPa. At ∼10 and 20 GPa, there are two isostructural changes in the compound, corresponding to, respectively, the emergence of the interlayer coupling and start of interlayer atomic bonding. At a pressure between 35 and 40 GPa, the vdW layers start to slide and then merge, forming a new phase with high coordination numbers. We also found that the Bardeen–Cooper–Schrieffer (BCS) theory describes quite well the pressure dependence of the critical temperature despite occurrence of a possible medium-to-strong electron–phonon coupling, revealing the determinant roles of the enhanced bulk modulus and electron density of states at high pressure. Moreover, nanosizing of CuP₂Se at high pressure further increased the critical temperature even at sizes approaching the Anderson limit. These findings would have important implications for developing novel applications of layered vdW compounds through simple pressure tuning of the interlayer coupling.  aPublisher supplied data 3aambient temperature 3alithium 3asuperconductivity 3avan der Waals forces1 aFeng, Jiajia1 aZhang, Xiaoliang1 aLi, Cong1 aDong, Hongliang1 aDeng, Wen1 aLiu, Junxiu1 aTian, Hua1 aChen, Jian1 aJiang, Sheng1 aSheng, Hongwei1 aChen, Bin1 aZhang, Hengzhong1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2322-22740 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2021 Nov. 23, v. 143, no. 48 p.20343-20355dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19166x1520-51267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jacs.1c097353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02913naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100005300142245008200195500002000277520171700297592002802014596006302042650001502105650002402120650001502144650001102159650001302170650001002183650002602193650001602219700005302235700005302288773013602341856007702477852000902554655001202563IND60773199420221118094246.0220412e202107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077319942DNAL7 a10.1029/2020JB0214762doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZidan, A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5633-885812aA Pareto Multi‐Objective Optimization Approach for Anisotropic Shale Models  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aWhen the elastic parameters of rocks such as shales vary with the propagation direction of a passing seismic wave that rock is called anisotropic. Modern seismic data are typically acquired over a wide azimuth range using long offsets. For such data, optimum imaging and subsequent quantitative amplitude interpretation requires taking subsurface anisotropy adequately into account during execution of the quantitative interpretation workflow. Here, we present a multi‐objective approach to find an optimal solution using both well logs and seismic data. We include minimization of a seismic match objective function as a constraint to narrow the uncertainty distribution around model parameters and to ensure that the model is consistent with seismic as well as well log data. Consequently, the resulting anisotropy model can be used for both well logs and seismic data analysis. First, the Hudson‐Cheng crack model is used to obtain rock matrices properties and aspect ratio of a set of ellipsoidal cracks. Then, we obtain a set of non‐dominated solutions, which minimizes the rock physics model multi‐parameter objective function and the Amplitude‐Versus‐Offset objective function. The approach is applied to field data with one vertical well log and pre‐stack migrated seismic data. In spite of the low signal‐to‐noise ratio of the seismic data, the overall results are consistent with the rock physics model and fit the seismic amplitude variations, particularly for the confidently interpretable mid‐to‐far angles of incidence. Furthermore, we extend the approach to predict seismic anisotropy away from well calibration, to map the occurrence of high‐quality organic‐rich shales.  aPublisher supplied data  cEconomic Development Board ‐ Singapore SINGA Scholarship 3aanisotropy 3ageophysical logging 3ageophysics 3amodels 3aresearch 3ashale 3asignal-to-noise ratio 3auncertainty1 aLi, Y.

It is believed that the examination of only one production year may not adequately reflect temporal representativeness and may therefore lead to unreliable results. The current study also provides a method to deal with variability when temporal representativeness cannot be ensured. METHODS: All material flows related to milk production from six consecutive milk years in an organic dairy farm in northern Germany were analysed. The milk yield of the 75 to 91 cows varied between 5418 and 7102 kg energy corrected milk (ECM) per cow and year. GHG emissions were estimated using calculation guidelines from the International Dairy Federation (IDF) and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). Emissions were calculated in the Flow Analysis and Resource Management (FARM) model ensuring mass balances for nitrogen and phosphorous in every subsection of the model. Based on the variability of crop yields, the number of years for representative average data was calculated as well as an uncertainty when only a limited number of years was available. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Estimated GHG emissions varied between 0.88 and 1.09 kg CO₂-eq kg⁻¹ ECM⁻¹ (mean, standard deviation of the mean = 0.97 and 0.07 kg CO₂-eq kg⁻¹ ECM⁻¹). Emissions from ruminant digestion had the highest contribution (50.9 ± 2.3) percent in relation to overall product-related GHG emissions. Direct emissions from soil showed the highest coefficient of variation (36%) due to simultaneous changes in fertilization amount, crop yield and milk yield which showed no significant direct relationship. The number of years needed to be assessed for representative average yields was between 27 and 215 years for clover grass and maize silage, respectively. When performing a sensitivity analysis based on the variability of crop yields, the assessed farm showed reliable results with average data of at least 4 years. CONCLUSIONS: Temporal representativeness should be dealt with explicitly in GHG assessments for dairy farming. If the representativeness of crop yields cannot be ensured, an uncertainty bandwidth of the results based on variability of yields can provide a basis for comparing different farms or farming systems. This approach could also be extended to other variabilities in dairy farming for more reliability of results.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimate change 3acorn silage 3acows 3acrop yield 3adairy farming 3adigestion 3aenergy 3afarming systems 3agrasses 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3agreenhouse gases 3aguidelines 3amilk 3amilk yield 3amodels 3anitrogen 3aphosphorus 3aresource management 3asoil 3astatistical analysis 3auncertainty 3aGermany1 aPaulsen, HansMarten1 aBerg, Werner1 aProchnow, A.,0 tinternational journal of life cycle assessment.g2018 Jan., v. 23, no. 1 p.41-54dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:J000000330x0948-33497nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11367-017-1307-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03601naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245023200165300001600397520182800413592002802241650001502269650002502284650003502309650001602344650002502360650001202385650001102397650001102408650002002419650001002439650001002449650001202459650000902471650000902480650001102489650000702500650001502507650001302522650002702535650002502562650001502587650001002602653005102612653002702663653002002690653001202710653000902722653004102731700001802772700001902790700002002809773009202829856008102921852000903002655001203011IND60528530820221118143820.0160716e20160204xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052853082DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aca.2015.12.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYilmaz, Erkan10aBovine serum albumin-Cu(II) hybrid nanoflowers: An effective adsorbent for solid phase extraction and slurry sampling flame atomic absorption spectrometric analysis of cadmium and lead in water, hair, food and cigarette samples  ap. 110-117.  aHerein, the synthesis of bovine serum albumin-Cu(II) hybrid nanoflowers (BSA-NFs) through the building blocks of bovine serum albumin (BSA) and copper(II) ions in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and their use as adsorbent for cadmium and lead ions are reported. The BSA-NFs, for the first time, were efficiently utilized as novel adsorbent for solid phase extraction (SPE) of cadmium and lead ions in water, food, cigarette and hair samples. The method is based on the separation and pre-concentration of Cd(II) and Pb(II) by BSA-NFs prior to determination by slurry analysis via flame atomic absorption spectrometry (FAAS). The analytes were adsorbed on BSA-NFs under the vortex mixing and then the ion-loaded slurry was separated and directly introduced into the flame AAS nebulizer by using a hand-made micro sample introduction system to eliminate a number of drawbacks. The effects of analytical key parameters, such as pH, amount of BSA-NFs, vortexing time, sample volume, and matrix effect of foreign ions on adsorbing of Cd(II) and Pb(II) were systematically investigated and optimized. The limits of detection (LODs) for Cd(II) and Pb(II) were calculated as 0.37 μg L−1 and 8.8 μg L−1, respectively. The relative standard deviation percentages (RSDs) (N = 5) for Cd(II) and Pb(II) were 7.2%, and 5.0%, respectively. The accuracy of the developed procedure was validated by the analysis of certified reference materials (TMDA-53.3 Fortified Water, TMDA-70 Fortified Water, SPS-WW2 Waste Water, NCSDC-73349 Bush Branches and Leaves) and by addition/recovery analysis. The quantitative recoveries were obtained for the analysis of certified reference materials and addition/recovery tests. The method was successfully applied to the analysis of cadmium and lead in water, food, cigarette and hair samples.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorbents 3aanalytical chemistry 3aatomic absorption spectrometry 3ablood serum 3abovine serum albumin 3acadmium 3acattle 3acopper 3adetection limit 3afoods 3ahairs 3ahybrids 3aions 3alead 3amixing 3apH 3aphosphates 3aslurries 3asolid phase extraction 3astatistical analysis 3awastewater 3awater 0aBovine serum albumin-Cu(II) hybrid nanoflowers 0aSolid phase extraction 0aSlurry sampling 0aCadmium 0aLead 0aFlame atomic absorption spectrometry1 aOcsoy, Ismail1 aOzdemir, Nalan1 aSoylak, Mustafa0 tAnalytica chimica acta.g2016 Feb. 04, v. 906 p.110-117dElsevier B.V.x0003-26707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aca.2015.12.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02044naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003100113040001800144100002000162245003700182300001600219520104000235592002801275650001401303650001101317650001401328650002401342650002301366650003301389650002401422650002301446650001201469650000901481650001101490700002101501773009501522856004401617852000901661655001201670IND50073148620221119073115.0140219e200112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007314862DNAL7 a118242222pmid7 a10.1007/s0011401002582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOverduin, James10aMatter, spacetime and the vacuum  ap. 491-503.  aWe distinguish three historical and scientific views of matter, spacetime, and the relationship between them: the absolute approach of Newton, the relational approach most often associated with Mach, and a third, geometrical approach which inspired Einstein and continues to drive efforts toward a unified theory of fundamental interactions today. Which is correct? We suggest that this is, to a large extent, an "ill-posed question," reminiscent of the wave/particle debate in earlier times. The boundary between matter and spacetime is no longer easy to draw, and it is likely that they are complementary aspects of the same reality. There is no clearer illustration of this than the modern view of the vacuum. We review the importance of this concept in cosmology, and explore the extent to which the old idea of an "empty" vacuum might still be maintained. If the real cosmological vacuum is far from empty, as observations now suggest, then it may be possible to achieve an even simpler goal: a Universe with a net energy of zero.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemistry 3aenergy 3aequations 3amathematical models 3atemporal variation 2aExtraterrestrial Environment 2aModels, Theoretical 2aPhysical Phenomena 2aPhysics 2aTime 2aVacuum1 aFahr, Hans-Jörg0 tNaturwissenschaften.g2001 Dec., v. 88, no. 12 p.491-503dSpringer-Verlagx0028-10427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s001140100258  aDNAL 7aarticle02938naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245011200166300001400278520131000292592002801602650003401630650003101664650003101695650002401726650001601750650002001766650002201786650002101808650001901829650001901848650001801867650001701885650001301902650001401915650002101929653000801950653001601958653000801974653003601982653003202018653002302050700001602073700001602089700001302105700001502118700001402133700001702147700001502164700001702179773008302196856008402279852000902363655001202372IND60552040520221119173705.0170412e201610  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055204052DNAL7 a10.1016/j.molimm.2016.08.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Wenjie10aDecreased immunosuppressive actions of 1α, 25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 in patients with immune thrombocytopenia  ap. 89-97.  aPrimary immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is an acquired autoimmune disease. 1α, 25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 [1,25(OH)2D3] and vitamin D receptor (VDR) play important immune-suppressive roles in immune system. It has been reported that serum 1,25(OH)2D3 were lower in ITP patients. In this study, we evaluated local 1,25(OH)2D3 level and VDR mRNA expression further, and determined whether 1,25(OH)2D3/VDR were correlated with T cell dysfunction in ITP patients. We found that 1,25(OH)2D3/VDR levels were decreased in active ITP patients, and 1,25(OH)2D3 had significant anti-inflammatory effects on ITP patients, including both anti-proliferation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and reversing the abnormal T cells polarization. 1,25(OH)2D3 inhibited the differentiation of T helper (Th)1 and Tc1 cells but induced the differentiation of Th2, Tc2 and T regulatory (Treg) cells in ITP patients. However, the percentage of Th17 cells were not affected obviously with 1,25(OH)2D3. In addition, 1,25(OH)2D3 also suppressed pro-inflammatory cytokines (INF-γ and IL-17A) but promoted anti-inflammatory cytokine (IL-10) secretion in ITP patients. In conclusion, decreased 1,25(OH)2D3/VDR might participate in the pathogenesis of ITP, and appropriate supplement of 1,25(OH)2D3 may be a promising treatment.  aPublisher supplied data 3a1alpha-hydroxycholecalciferol 3aCD4-positive T-lymphocytes 3aanti-inflammatory activity 3aautoimmune diseases 3ablood serum 3agene expression 3aimmunosuppression 3ainterferon-gamma 3ainterleukin-10 3ainterleukin-17 3amessenger RNA 3apathogenesis 3apatients 3asecretion 3athrombocytopenia 0aITP 0a1,25(OH)2D3 0aVDR 0aPrimary immune thrombocytopenia 0a1α, 25-Dihydroxyvitamin D3 0aVitamin D receptor1 aLi, Huiyuan1 aHao, Yating1 aLi, Yang1 aLv, Mingen1 aXue, Feng1 aLiu, Xiaofan1 aZhang, Lei1 aYang, Renchi0 tMolecular Immunology.g2016 Oct., v. 78 p.89-97dElsevier Ltdx0161-58907nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.molimm.2016.08.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03481naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100005900139245009800198300001800296500002000314520154300334592002801877596004301905596004601948650002301994650001802017650001602035650001502051650001902066650001802085650001602103650001202119650001602131650001702147650001702164650002702181650001702208650002102225650001402246650003002260650001902290650001302309650001202322700006002334700006302394700006302457700007402520700003402594700006302628773012802691856007402819961001302893852000902906655001202915IND60772806020221118041034.0220410e202205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077280602DNAL7 a10.1111/pce.142872doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMomayyezi, Mina1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8039-368110aDesiccation of the leaf mesophyll and its implications for CO2 diffusion and light processing  ap. 1362-1381.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aLeaves balance CO₂ and radiative absorption while maintaining water transport to maximise photosynthesis. Related species with contrasting leaf anatomy can provide insights into inherent and stress‐induced links between structure and function for commonly measured leaf traits for important crops. We used two walnut species with contrasting mesophyll anatomy to evaluate these integrated exchange processes under non‐stressed and drought conditions using a combination of light microscopy, X‐ray microCT, gas exchange, hydraulic conductance, and chlorophyll distribution profiles through leaves. Juglans regia had thicker palisade mesophyll, higher fluorescence in the palisade, and greater low‐mesophyll porosity that were associated with greater gas‐phase diffusion (gIAS), stomatal and mesophyll (gₘ) conductances and carboxylation capacity. More and highly‐packed mesophyll cells and bundle sheath extensions (BSEs) in Juglans microcarpa led to higher fluorescence in the spongy and in proximity to the BSEs. Both species exhibited drought‐induced reductions in mesophyll cell volume, yet the associated increases in porosity and gIAS were obscured by declines in biochemical activity that decreased gₘ. Inherent differences in leaf anatomy between the species were linked to differences in gas exchange, light absorption and photosynthetic capacity, and drought‐induced changes in leaf structure impacted performance via imposing species‐specific limitations to light absorption, gas exchange and hydraulics.  aPublisher supplied data  cKatherine Esau Postdoctoral Fellowship  a#5306‐21220‐004‐00cUSDA–ARS CRIS 3aJuglans microcarpa 3aJuglans regia 3aX-radiation 3aabsorption 3acarbon dioxide 3acarboxylation 3achlorophyll 3adrought 3aenvironment 3afluorescence 3agas exchange 3ahydraulic conductivity 3aleaf anatomy 3alight microscopy 3amesophyll 3amicro-computed tomography 3aphotosynthesis 3aporosity 3awalnuts1 aBorsuk, Aleca M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1696-96471 aBrodersen, Craig R.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0924-25701 aGilbert, Matthew E.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6761-79751 aThéroux‐Rancourt, Guillaume1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2591-05241 aKluepfel, D.

Lab‐based studies have used acoustic emission data to predict time‐to‐failure and stress state, and in a few cases, the same approach has been used for field data. However, the underlying physical mechanisms that allow lab earthquake prediction and seismic forecasting remain poorly resolved. Here, we address this knowledge gap by coupling active‐source seismic data, which probe asperity‐scale processes, with ML methods. We show that elastic waves passing through the lab fault zone contain information that can predict the full spectrum of labquakes from slow slip instabilities to highly aperiodic events. The ML methods utilize systematic changes in P‐wave amplitude and velocity to accurately predict the timing and shear stress during labquakes. The ML predictions improve in accuracy closer to fault failure, demonstrating that the predictive power of the ultrasonic signals improves as the fault approaches failure. Our results demonstrate that the relationship between the ultrasonic parameters and fault slip rate, and in turn, the systematically evolving real area of contact and asperity stiffness allow the gradient boosting algorithm to “learn” about the state of the fault and its proximity to failure. Broadly, our results demonstrate the utility of physics‐informed ML in forecasting the imminence of fault slip at the laboratory scale, which may have important implications for earthquake mechanics in nature.  aPublisher supplied data  a835012cEuropean Research Council  aDE‐SC0020512cU.S. Department of Energy (DOE)  aDE‐EE0008763cU.S. Department of Energy (DOE)  aEAR 1520760cNational Science Foundation (NSF)  aEAR 1547441cNational Science Foundation (NSF)  aEAR 1763305cNational Science Foundation (NSF) 3aacoustics 3aalgorithms 3aearthquakes 3ageophysics 3aprediction 3aresearch 3ashear stress 3aultrasonics1 aBolton, David Chas1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2428-17431 aRivière, Jacques,1 aMarone, Chris1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4515-45000 tJournal of geophysical research.g2021 July, v. 126, no. 7 p.e2020JB021588-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:27943x2169-93137nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2020JB0215883Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03889naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100003300150245009700183300001400280520228400294592002802578650001902606650003302625650001602658650001502674650001602689650003802705650001002743650001202753650002502765650001502790650001202805650001902817650002002836650001302856650002202869650002302891650001502914653000802929653002302937653001102960653002402971653003402995700003103029700003003060700003203090700001903122700003003141773008303171856008403254852000903338655001203347IND60552040620221119173516.0170412e201610  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055204062DNAL7 a10.1016/j.molimm.2016.08.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBoldt, Angelica Beate Winter12aA dual role for Mannan-binding lectin-associated serine protease 2 (MASP-2) in HIV infection  ap. 48-56.  aMannan-binding lectin (MBL) – associated serine protease 2 (MASP-2) co-activates the lectin pathway of complement in response to several viral infections. The quality of this response partly depends on MASP2 gene polymorphisms, which modulate MASP-2 function and serum levels. In this study we investigated a possible role of MASP2 polymorphisms, MASP-2 serum levels and MBL-mediated complement activation in the susceptibility to HIV/AIDS and HBV/HCV coinfection.A total of 178 HIV patients, 89 (50%) coinfected with HBV/HCV, 51.7% female, average age 40 (12–73) years, and 385 controls were evaluated. MASP-2 levels and MBL-driven complement activation were evaluated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and 11 MASP2 polymorphisms from the promoter to the last exon were haplotyped using multiplex sequence-specific PCR.Genotype distribution was in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium and differed between HIV+ patients and controls (P=0.030), irrespective of HBV or HCV coinfection. The p.126L variant, which was associated with MASP-2 levels <200ng/mL (OR=5.0 [95%CI=1.3–19.2] P=0.019), increased the susceptibility to HIV infection (OR=5.67 [95%CI=1.75–18.33], P=0.004) and to HIV+HBV+ status (OR=6.44 [95%CI=1.69–24.53, P=0.006). A similar association occurred with the ancient haplotype harboring this variant, AGCDV (OR=2.35 [95%CI=1.31–4.23], P=0.004). On the other hand, p.126L in addition to other variants associated with low MASP-2 levels—p.120G, p.377A and p.439H, presented a protective effect against AIDS (OR=0.25 [95%CI=0.08–0.80], P=0.020), independently of age, sex, hepatic function and viral load. MASP-2 serum levels were lower in HIV+ and HIV+HBV+ patients than in controls (P=0.0004). Among patients, MASP-2 levels were higher in patients with opportunistic diseases (P=0.001) and AIDS (P=0.004). MASP-2 levels correlated positively with MBL/MASP2-mediated C4 deposition (r=0.29, P=0.0002) and negatively with CD4+ cell counts (r=−0.21, P=0.018), being related to decreased CD4+ cell counts (OR=5.8 [95%CI=1.23–27.5, P=0.026).Genetically determined MASP-2 levels seem to have a two-edge effect in HIV and probably HCV/HBV coinfection, whereas low levels increase the susceptibility to infection, but on the other side protects against AIDS.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHIV infections 3aHuman immunodeficiency virus 3ablood serum 3acomplement 3acorrelation 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3aexons 3afemales 3agenetic polymorphism 3ahaplotypes 3alectins 3aliver function 3amixed infection 3apatients 3aprotective effect 3aserine proteinases 3aviral load 0aHIV 0aMASP2 polymorphism 0aMASP-2 0aHCV/HBV coinfection 0aHaplotype-specific genotyping1 aBeltrame, Márcia Holsbach1 aCatarino, Sandra Jeremias1 aMeissner, Caroline Grisbach1 aTizzot, Regina1 aMessias-Reason, Iara Jose0 tMolecular Immunology.g2016 Oct., v. 78 p.48-56dElsevier Ltdx0161-58907nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.molimm.2016.08.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02168naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001800142245011300160300002000273520099700293592002801290650002801318650002201346650002001368700005101388700005601439700001101495700002501506700002001531700005601551773014901607856007701756852000901833655001201842IND60759335620221117222929.0211208e20211122xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075933562DNAL7 a10.1021/jacs.1c099252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZheng, Mengxi10aKinetic DNA Self-Assembly: Simultaneously Co-folding Complementary DNA Strands into Identical Nanostructures  ap. 20363-20367.  aDNA origami is a powerful method for constructing DNA nanostructures. It requires long single-stranded DNAs. The preparation of such long DNA strands is often quite tedious and has a limited production yield. In contrast, duplex DNAs can be easily prepared via enzymatic reactions in large quantities. Thus, we ask a question: can we design DNA nanostructures in such a way that the two complementary strands can simultaneously fold into the designed structures in the same solution instead of hybridizing with each other to form a DNA duplex? By engineering DNA interaction kinetics, herein we are able to provide multiple examples to concretely demonstrate a positive answer to this question. The resulting DNA nanostructures have been thoroughly characterized by electrophoresis and atomic force microscopy imaging. The reported strategy is compatible with the DNA cloning method and thus would provide a convenient method for the large-scale production of the designed DNA nanostructures.  aPublisher supplied data 3aatomic force microscopy 3acomplementary DNA 3aelectrophoresis1 aLi, Zhe1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9402-49401 aLiu, Longfei1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5760-29641 aLi, Mo1 aPaluzzi, Victoria E.1 aHyun Choi, Jong1 aMao, Chengde1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7516-86660 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2021 Nov. 22, v. 143, no. 48 p.20363-20367dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19166x1520-51267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jacs.1c099253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03793naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245018000171520236700351592002802718650001402746650002302760650005302783650001702836650001302853650002202866650002202888650001802910650001702928650001602945650001102961650002602972650002102998650002003019650002203039700001803061700001803079700002103097773013403118856008503252961001303337852000903350655001203359IND60672777020221121004108.0191017e20190613xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067277702DNAL7 a10.1093/cdn/nzz039.P18-005-192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBowman, Shanthy10aMeeting the Dietary Guidelines Added Sugars Recommendation Is Associated with Higher Fruit, Dairy, and Whole Grains Intakes in Children: WWEIA, NHANES 2015–2016 (P18-005-19)  aThe 2015–2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans (DGA) recommend that Americans limit their added sugars intake to less than 10% of their total calories (energy) for the day, because the calories obtained from added sugars often come with low nutritional benefits. The research objective was to compare mean intakes of nutritious foods such as fruit, dairy, and whole grains by children grouped based on whether they met the DGA added sugars recommendation or not. Children ages 2 to 19 years who had complete dietary intake data on day 1 of What We Eat in America, National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, 2015–2016 were included in the study. They were divided into two groups: (1) those who met the DGA added sugars recommendation; and (2) those who did not meet the recommendation. Energy and selected food group intakes of the two groups were estimated and compared using SAS-callable SUDAAN software, and a p-value less than 0.01 was considered as significantly different. There were 2901 children in the study. Only about one-third of all children (34.8 ± 1.2%), met the added sugars recommendation, and household income did not impact the percentage of children meeting the recommendation. Forty-seven % of 2–5 year old and 31% of 6–19 year old children met the recommendation. The estimated mean added sugars intake of the children who met the recommendation was considerably lower than those who did not meet the recommendation, 6.4 ± 0.23 vs. 21.2 ± 0.51 teaspoon equivalents (eq.), respectively. The children who met the recommendation had significantly lower energy intake than those who did not meet the recommendation, 1764 ± 32 vs. 1924 ± 30 kilocalories, respectively. In spite of their lower energy intake, children who met the recommendation had significantly higher intakes of total fruit, 1.3 ± 0.05 vs. 0.8 ± 0.05 cup eq.; total dairy, 2.1 ± 0.12 vs. 1.8 ± 0.08 cup eq.; and whole grains 1.0 ± 0.07 vs. 0.8 ± 0.04 ounce eq. than the other group. In other words, those who met the recommendation made better food choices by eating nutritious foods for lower energy intake. The study findings showed that high added sugars intake have the potential to replace nutritious foods and reduce the overall quality of the diet, in children. The study was funded by USDA, Agricultural Research Service.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAmericans 3aDietary Guidelines 3aNational Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 3aadded sugars 3achildren 3acomputer software 3adairy consumption 3aenergy intake 3afood choices 3afood groups 3afruits 3ahealthy eating habits 3ahousehold income 3anutritive value 3awhole grain foods1 aLaComb, Randy1 aFriday, James1 aMoshfegh, Alanna0 tCurrent developments in nutrition.g2019 June 13, v. 3, no.

Present‐day structure and composition of the lithosphere and sublithospheric mantle may help in constraining the geodynamic evolution of the region. We use an integrated geophysical‐petrological modeling to derive and compare the present‐day thermal, density and compositional structure of the lithosphere and sublithospheric mantle along two NNW‐SSE oriented transects crossing the back‐arc Alboran and Algerian basins, from onshore Iberia to the northern Africa margin. The crust is constrained using available seismic data and geological cross‐sections, whereas seismic tomography and mantle xenoliths constrain the upper mantle structure and composition. Results show a thick crust (37 and 30 km) and a relative deep LAB (130 and 150 km) underneath the HP/LT metamorphic units of the Internal Betics and Greater Kabylies, respectively, which contrast with the 16 km thick magmatic crust of the Alboran Basin and the 10 km thick oceanic crust of the Algerian Basin. The sharp change in lithosphere thickness, from the orogenic wedge to the back‐arc basins, contrasts with the gentler lithosphere thickening toward the respective opposed margins. Our results confirm the presence of detached slabs ∼400 °C colder than upper mantle and a fertile composition than the continental lithospheric mantle beneath the External Betics and Saharan Atlas. Presence of detached quasi‐vertical sublithospheric slabs dipping toward the SSE in the Betics and toward the NNW in the Kabylies and the opposed symmetric lithospheric structure support an opposite dipping subduction and retreat of two adjacent segments of the Jurassic Ligurian‐Tethys realm.  aPublisher supplied data  a674899‐SUBITOP‐H2020‐MSCA‐ITN‐2015cEU Marie Curie Initial Training Network ‘SUBITOP’  aPIE‐CSIC‐201830E039, CSICcSUBTETIS  aPIE‐CSIC‐202030E310cALORBE  aPGC2018‐095154‐B‐I00cGeoCAM  cEquinor R&T Fornebu  cGeneralitat de Catalunya  a2017 SGR 847cAgència de Gestió d'Ajuts Universitaris i de Recerca 3aJurassic period 3abasins 3ageophysics 3aresearch 3asubduction 3atomography 3aIberian Peninsula 3aNorthern Africa1 aFernàndez, Manel1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4487-23591 aVergés, Jaume,1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4467-52911 aTorne, Montserrat1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6585-42831 aJiménez‐Munt, Ivone1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4178-35850 tJournal of geophysical research.g2021 July, v. 126, no. 7 p.e2020JB021388-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:27943x2169-93137nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2020JB0213883Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01871naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002200148245010100170300001600271520047600287592002800763650002200791650001600813650001100829650002300840650001300863650001700876653003800893653002400931653002000955653002400975653001600999653002701015653001501042653002301057653001201080653001201092700002101104700002001125700001801145700001801163700001801181773011101199856008201310852000901392655001201401IND60601183020221120132411.0180706e201401  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060118302DNAL7 a10.1016/j.trac.2013.08.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGómez, Cristina,10aAnalytical strategies based on mass spectrometric techniques for the study of steroid metabolism  ap. 106-116.  aAnabolic androgenic steroids (AASs) are synthetic substances derived from testosterone, whose use in sports is prohibited.

A portable and reusable optofluidic nano-biosensing platform was applied to investigate the sandwich-like immunoassay mechanism and format of small molecules, as well as the binding kinetics between QD immunoprobe and anti-small molecule antibody. A two-step immunoassay method that involves pre-incubation mixture of different concentration of small molecule and anti-small molecule antibody, and subsequent introduction of QD immunoprobe into the optofluidic cell was conducted for small molecule determination. Compared with the one-step immunoassay method, the two-step immunoassay method can obtain higher fluorescence signal and higher sensitivity index, thus improving the nano-biosensing performance. Based on the proposed strategy, two mode targets, namely, microcystin-LR (MC-LR) and Bisphenol A (BPA) were tested with high sensitivity, rapidity, and ease of use. A higher concentration of small molecules in the sample led to less anti-small molecule antibody bound with antigen-carrier protein conjugate immobilized onto the sensor surface, and less QD immunoprobes bound with anti-small molecule antibody. This phenomenon lowered the fluorescence signal detected by nano-biosensing platform. Under optimal operating conditions, MC-LR and BPA exhibited a limit of detection of 0.003 and 0.04 μg/L, respectively. The LODs were better than those of the indirect competitive immunoassay method for small molecules via Cy5.5-labeled anti-small molecule antibody. The proposed QD-based sandwich-like immunoassay strategy was evaluated in spiked water samples, and showed good recovery, precision and accuracy without complicated sample pretreatments. All these results demonstrate that the new detection strategy could be readily applied to the other trace small molecules in real water samples.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanalytical chemistry 3aantibodies 3abisphenol A 3aconjugated proteins 3adetection limit 3afluorescence 3aimmunoassays 3aimmunoglobulin G 3amicrocystin-LR 3aquantum dots 0aQuantum dots 0aImmunoassay 0aSmall molecule 0aNanosensor 0aOptofluidics1 aZhu, Anna1 aLou, Xuening1 aSong, Dan1 aYang, Rong1 aShi, Hanchang1 aLong, Feng0 tAnalytica chimica acta.g2016 Jan. 28, v. 905 p.140-148dElsevier B.V.x0003-26707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aca.2015.12.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04676naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002800147245012500175300001300300520299500313592002803308650001903336650004003355650002403395650001703419650004003436650001503476650002303491650001103514650002503525650001803550650001603568650002003584650002903604650001603633650002203649650001303671650001103684650001803695650000903713650000903722650002003731650001803751650001703769650001003786650002103796700001703817700002503834700002303859773014903882856008204031852000904113655001204122IND60588742420221120024427.0180619e201801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058874242DNAL7 a10.1007/s11367-017-1299-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 avan Zanten, HannahH. E.10aAttributional versus consequential life cycle assessment and feed optimization: alternative protein sources in pig diets  ap. 1-11.  aPURPOSE: Feed production is responsible for the majority of the environmental impact of livestock production, especially for monogastric animals, such as pigs. Some feeding strategies demonstrated that replacing one ingredient with a high impact, e.g. soybean meal (SBM), with an alternative protein source, e.g. locally produced peas or rapeseed meal, has potential to reduce the environmental impact. These studies, however, used an attributional life cycle assessment (ALCA), which solely addresses the direct environmental impact of a product. A replacement of SBM with alternative protein sources, however, can also have indirect environmental consequences, which might change environmental benefits of using alternative protein sources. This study aims to explore differences in results when performing an ALCA and a CLCA to reduce the environmental impact of pig production. We illustrated this for two case studies: replacing SBM with rapeseed meal (RSM), and replacing SBM with waste-fed larvae meal in diets of finishing-pigs. METHODS: We used an ALCA and CLCA to assess global warming potential (GWP), energy use (EU) and land use (LU) of replacing SBM with RSM and waste-fed larvae meal, for finishing-pigs. The functional unit was 1 kg of body weight gain. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Based on an ALCA, replacing SBM with RSM showed that GWP (3%) and EU (1%) were not changed, but LU was decreased (14%). ALCA results for replacing SBM with waste-fed larvae meal showed that EU did not change (1%), but GWP (10%) and LU (56%) were decreased. Based on a CLCA, replacing SBM with RSM showed an increased GWP (15%), EU (12%) and LU (10%). Replacing SBM with waste-fed larvae meal showed an increased GWP (60%) and EU (89%), but LU (70%) was decreased. Furthermore, the results of the sensitivity analysis showed that assumptions required to perform a CLCA, such as definition of the marginal product, have a large impact on final results but did not affect the final conclusions. CONCLUSIONS: The CLCA results seem to contradict the ALCA results. CLCA results for both case studies showed that using co-products and waste-fed larvae meal currently not reduces the net environmental impact of pork production. This would have been overlooked when results were only based on ALCA. To gain insight into the environmental impact of feed, animal nutritionists can use an ALCA. If policy makers or the feed industry, however, want to assess the net environmental impact of a potential feeding strategy, it is recommended to perform a CLCA. Feed and food markets are, however, highly dynamic. Pig feed optimization is based on least cost optimization and a wide range of ingredients are available; diet compositions can, therefore, change easily, resulting in different environmental impacts. Ideally, therefore, a CLCA should include a sensitivity analysis (e.g. different feed prices or different marginal products) to provide a range of possible outcomes to make the results more robust.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEuropean Union 3aattributional life cycle assessment 3abody weight changes 3acase studies 3aconsequential life cycle assessment 3acoproducts 3aecosystem services 3aenergy 3aenvironmental impact 3afeed industry 3afeed prices 3afeeding methods 3aglobal warming potential 3aingredients 3aissues and policy 3aland use 3alarvae 3anutritionists 3apeas 3apork 3aprotein sources 3arapeseed meal 3asoybean meal 3aswine 3aswine production1 aBikker, Paul1 aMeerburg, BastiaanG.1 ade Boer, ImkeJ.

This paper reports an empirical application of industrial dynamics to a problem of an industry system. A second generation model was developed and used to appraise alternative supply control policies designed to reduce fluctuations in marketings of frozen concentrated orange juice and grower profits. Policies that controlled long‐run supplies by constraining tree plantings appeared to have the most potential for success. Policies designed to control market supplies on a year‐to‐year basis actually encouraged new tree plantings which created long‐run supply problems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural economics 3adynamic models 3aeconomists 3aindustry 3aissues and policy 3amarkets 3aorange juice 3aprofits and margins 3atrees1 aLangham, Max R.0 tAmerican journal of agricultural economics.g1970 May, v. 52, no. 2 p.197-208dOxford University PresswJournal:jnl44932x0002-90927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2307/12374903Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03965naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002300151245010200174300001600276520230200292592002802594650003402622650001902656650002502675650001102700650001302711650001402724650001802738650001102756650001902767650004302786650001102829650001502840650001502855650002502870650001602895650001402911650001002925650001102935650001002946650001102956653001602967653001502983653001902998653002503017653002103042700002103063700002503084700002503109700001803134700002303152773011703175856008603292852000903378655001203387IND60570356820221120111416.0190408e20171201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057035682DNAL7 a10.1016/j.indcrop.2017.05.0572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEftekhari, Maliheh10aChemodiversity evaluation of grape (Vitis vinifera) vegetative parts during summer and early fall  ap. 267-277.  aThe majority of studies on grape secondary metabolism are focusing on the berry or stem and leaves phenolic composition. Although the composition of phytochemicals is known to be highly variable in different cultivars, the changes of this composition during vine growth in vegetative parts remain poorly understood. The present study was performed to profile and compare several non-colored polyphenol compounds and the antioxidant potential of Vitis vinifera leaves and stems during a part of growing season and early fall (July, August, September and October) from seventy Iranian native cultivars (white and red) using HPLC-DAD method. Leaves showed significantly higher amounts of analyzed phenolics. Considering the average amounts, the most predominant detected phenolics in the leaves were catechin and o-coumaric acid while the most abundant compound found in the stems was quercetin. Naringenin was found as the lowest detected phenolic. The phenolic potential of the samples varied in each time point. Antioxidant activity was detected higher in stems than leaves with the highest in white cultivar “Atabaki” in both leaves and stems. Leaves of the red cultivars “Angourab” and “Yaghouti shiraz” showed the highest concentrations considering the summation of analyzed phenolics. In addition to the cultivar and plant organ, the phenolic potential of the samples varied in each time point. All samples exhibited antioxidant activity using the DPPH radical and Folin-Ciocalteo Reagent, with mostly higher amounts in stems than leaves showing a strong correlation between two methods In view of both methods, white cultivars were more often higher than red ones with the highest amounts detected in stems and leaves of white cultivar “Atabaki”. PCA results confirmed the variability of phenolic composition in grapevines and during four-month development and showed no obvious discrimination among red and white cultivars. As far as we know, this is the first time that a relationship between the content of polyphenolic compounds is evaluated in leaves and stems, as well as the targeted phenolic profiling of several cultivars foliage. Targeted phenolics profiling indicated the high potential of such wastes to be used in the pharmaceutical, cosmetic and food industries.  aPublisher supplied data 3a2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl 3aVitis vinifera 3aantioxidant activity 3aautumn 3acatechin 3acultivars 3afood industry 3agrapes 3agrowing season 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3aleaves 3ametabolism 3anaringenin 3aphytopharmaceuticals 3apolyphenols 3aquercetin 3astems 3asummer 3avines 3awastes 0aPolyphenols 0aFlavonoids 0aVitis vinifera 0aAntioxidant activity 0aVine foliar part1 aYadollahi, Abbas1 aFord, Christopher M.1 aShojaeiyan, Abdolali1 aAyyari, Mahdi1 aHokmabadi, Hossein0 tIndustrial crops and products.g2017 Dec. 01, v. 108 p.267-277dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl49222x0926-66907nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.indcrop.2017.05.0573Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03960naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002300150245009200173300001600265520246200281592002802743650002502771650002102796650002202817650002002839650001502859650001102874650001302885650001502898650001402913650001402927650001502941650001902956650001102975651001202986653002702998653001803025653001303043653001503056653001203071700001803083700002203101700002203123700002703145700002203172700001903194700001903213773010403232856008503336852000903421655001203430IND60585760420221118084311.0181010e20181101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058576042DNAL7 a10.1016/j.sedgeo.2017.11.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAugustsson, Carita10aZircon size-age sorting and source-area effect: The German Triassic Buntsandstein Group  ap. 218-231.  aThis study stresses how zircon-grain length versus age correlation significantly can improve provenance interpretations. Hence, taking sedimentary sorting effects into account, we present a detrital-zircon provenance study for continental deposits of the Central European, Lower Triassic Buntsandstein Group in Germany. The Buntsandstein Group was deposited in an extended intracontinental sag basin of Pangea under arid climate conditions. It included several intrabasinal tectonic swells, some of which have been assumed topographic highs acting as detrital source areas. This study of the Lower and Middle Buntsandstein subgroups in Central Germany indicates that particularly the Massif Central and the Bohemian Massif contributed to the basin fill of the central part of the Central European Basin. The Rhenish Massif, an assumed highland, was submerged. This interpretation is based on >1000 zircon grains from 12 sandstone beds. The unbroken grains in seven of the zircon separates have mean lengths of 190–220μm and five are composed 100–140μm long grains in average. All have a main population of 340–320Ma Carboniferous ages, representative of granitic, probably zircon-rich, rocks from the Variscan Orogen of the Massif Central and the Bohemian Massif. This first-cycle detritus was mixed with recycled, abraded zircon grains from Ediacaran to Palaeozoic metasedimentary units feeding the basin with 610–460Ma (Ediacaran to Ordovician) and 2Ga age grains, as is typical for Gondwana-derived material. The Ediacaran to Ordovician age population is common only in five samples with mean grain lengths of 100–140μm. Grains of such ages mainly are <130μm in the east, but equally common in all grain sizes in western sandstone beds. A western group was fed from the Massif Central and an eastern group derived from the Bohemian Massif. However, abrasion, age-population variations for pre-Variscan grains, and dominating wind directions indicate that two different fluvial systems delivered the Bohemian material and that this was combined with aeolian and alongshore lacustrine transport from the south and west. We conclude that interpretation of detrital zircon ages preferably are separately for different size classes, because zircon studies performed on broad grain-size intervals without considering possible size-age correlations may disguise sorting effects that potentially can lead to a misleading source-area interpretation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCarboniferous period 3aEdiacaran period 3aOrdovician period 3aTriassic period 3aarid zones 3abasins 3adetritus 3aprovenance 3asandstone 3atectonics 3atopography 3awind direction 3azircon 3aGermany 0aDetrital zircon U–Pb 0aBuntsandstein 0aTriassic 0aProvenance 0aSorting1 aVoigt, Thomas1 aBernhart, Kristin1 aKreißler, Marian1 aGaupp, R.q(Reinhard),1 aGärtner, Andreas1 aHofmann, Mandy1 aLinnemann, Ulf0 tSedimentary geology.g2018 Nov. 01, v. 375 p.218-231dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11737x0037-07387nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.sedgeo.2017.11.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03439naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003400111040001800145100002100163245010000184300001800284520187000302592002802172650002702200650001302227650001702240650002202257650002402279650002302303650000802326650001302334650003602347650001102383650002502394650001402419650001602433650002702449650002802476650003302504650001802537650006402555650003202619650003802651650002302689700002002712700002102732773009102753856008002844852000902924655001202933IND4460129420221118043000.0141111e201108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446012942DNAL7 a215699572pmid7 a10.1016/j.fm.2011.01.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSheen, Shiowshuh10aModeling the impact of chlorine on the behavior of Listeria monocytogenes on ready-to-eat meats  ap. 1095-1100.  aListeria monocytogenes (Lm) continues to pose a food safety hazard in ready-to-eat (RTE) meats due to potential cross-contamination. Chlorine is commonly used to sanitize processing equipment and utensils. However, Lm may survive the treatment and then contaminate food products. The objective of this study was to characterize the behavior of chlorine-exposed Lm on RTE ham during refrigerated storage. A two strain cocktail of Lm serotype 4b was pre-treated with chlorine (0, 25, and 50 ppm) for one hour, and then inoculated onto the surface of RTE ham to obtain an inoculum of about 3.0 log CFU/g. The inoculated ham samples were stored at 4, 8, and 16 °C, and Lm was enumerated periodically during the storage. The growth characteristics (lag time and growth rate) of Lm were estimated using the DMFit software. The results indicated that Lm growth was suppressed by the chlorine treatment. At 4 °C, the lag time of Lm with no (0 ppm) chlorine exposure (4.2 days) was shorter than those exposed to 25 ppm (5.4 days) and 50 ppm (6.8 days). The lag time decreased with the increase of temperature, e.g., at 25 ppm, the lag times were 5.2, 3.8 and 2.6 days for 4, 8 and 16 °C, respectively, and increased with the increase of chlorine concentration, e.g., at 16 °C, the lag times were 1.2, 2.6 and 4.0 days for 0, 25 and 50 ppm, respectively. However, growth rate increased with the increase of temperature and decreased with the increase of chlorine concentration. The lag time and growth rate as a function of chlorine concentration and temperature can be described using a modified Ratkowsky model and a modified Zwietering model, respectively. The results showed that the growth of Lm on RTE ham was delayed by pre-exposure to chlorine (at ≤50 ppm). The predictive models developed will contribute to microbial risk assessments of RTE meats.  aPublisher supplied data 3aListeria monocytogenes 3achlorine 3acold storage 3acomputer software 3across contamination 3afood contamination 3aham 3ainoculum 3amicrobiological risk assessment 3amodels 3aprocessing equipment 3aserotypes 3atemperature 2aChlorinexpharmacology 2aConsumer Product Safety 2aFood Contaminationxanalysis 2aFood Handling 2aListeria monocytogenesxdrug effectsxgrowth & development. 2aMeat Productsxmicrobiology 2aMicrobial Viabilityxdrug effects 2aModels, Biological1 aHwang, Cheng-An1 aJuneja, Vijay K.0 tFood microbiology.g2011 Aug., v. 28, no. 5 p.1095-1100dElsevier Ltdx0740-00207nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fm.2011.01.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01826naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100002300137245008400160300001600244500002000260520065800280592002800938650002700966650002400993650001501017650001501032650002001047650001901067650001301086650002201099650000901121650002501130700002501155700002401180773014301204856007101347961001301418852000901431655001201440IND60680229420221120171150.0200104e197008  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068022942DNAL7 a10.2307/12373912doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGruebele, James W.10aImpact of Food Chain Procurement Policies on the Fluid Milk Processing Industry  ap. 395-402.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe growth of the food chains and the adoption of centralized milk programs, including the use of private‐label brands and their own processing facilities, has improved the bargaining position of food chains relative to fluid milk processors.

Low light significantly restricts biomass and astaxanthin accumulation, thereby decreasing astaxanthin productivity. In this study, the effects of exogenous glycerol on the growth, photosynthesis, and astaxanthin and lipid accumulation in H. pluvialis under low light were investigated. A strategy was developed for promoting astaxanthin and lipid production in H. pluvialis under low light by the application of exogenous glycerol. Under low light, exogenous glycerol did not change the biomass and photosynthetic capacity of H. pluvialis. The addition of 1 mL L⁻¹ glycerol increased total lipid content by 36.8% by increasing the formation of fatty acids during an 11-day growth period. Furthermore, exogenous glycerol could directly accelerate astaxanthin production under low light by increasing the formation of substrates (e.g. pyruvate). Meanwhile, the elevated fatty acid level due to the addition of glycerol facilitated the esterification of astaxanthin, thereby accelerating the biosynthesis of astaxanthin indirectly, which is indicated by the fact that exogenous glycerol enhanced astaxanthin esters content significantly under low light. All these results suggest that H. pluvialis has the ability to utilize glycerol for astaxanthin and lipid production under low light.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHaematococcus pluvialis 3aastaxanthin 3abiomass 3abiosynthesis 3aesterification 3aesters 3afatty acids 3aglycerol 3alipid content 3aphotosynthesis 3apyruvic acid 3arain 0aLipid 0aLow light1 aZhang, Chunhui1 aLiu, Jianguo1 aYang, Ne,0 tAlgal research.g2020 Mar., v. 46 p.101779-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12360x2211-92647nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.algal.2019.1017793Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03329naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245010800170520185800278592002802136650001402164650004902178650005302227650000802280650002102288650002002309650002402329650001802353650002302371650001202394650001802406650002102424650002202445650001502467650001902482650001502501650002402516650002002540651001802560700001802578700001902596700001602615773013402631856008502765852000902850655001202859IND60672777720221121004141.0191017e20190613xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067277772DNAL7 a10.1093/cdn/nzz039.P18-012-192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFrancis, Ellen10aAdherence to DASH Dietary Pattern Is Inversely Associated with Osteoarthritis in Americans (P18-012-19)  aOsteoarthritis (OA) is a common disease which significantly contributes to disability among older adults. Dietary factors are suggested to play a role in preventing OA, however, studies in this area spare. The objective of this study was to assess the association between adherence to the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) and OA in American adults. This study included United States (US) adults (≥aged 20 years) who participated NHANES cycles 2007–2016. The Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) score was calculated from nine food items with a higher DASH score indicating better adherence to the DASH dietary pattern. Multivariable logistic regression models adjusted for age, education, race/ethnicity, household income, smoking, alcohol consumption, and total energy intake were used to estimate the adjusted odds ratios (aOR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) of DASH with OA. All analyses accounted for the complex survey design. Among the 17,349 participants included in this study, 9.05% reported OA. The DASH score was inversely associated with OA. The aOR (95% CI) were 1.00 (ref), 0.09 (0.70, 1.16), and 0.74 (0.58, 0.94) (Pₜᵣₑₙd = 0.01) across the DASH score tertiles. When analyses were stratified by BMI categories (normal, overweight, obese) the magnitude of the association was stronger and remained significant only among obese participants (i.e., BMI ≥ 30 kg/m²). Among participants with an obese BMI, participants with a DASH score in the highest tertile compared to participants with a DASH score in the lowest tertile had a 17% lower likelihood of having OA (P = 0.009). In a representative sample of American adults, higher adherence to the DASH dietary pattern was associated with lower likelihood of having OA and this association was particularly evident among obese individuals.

However, because the isolation of FDCs is difficult due to their very small population size and fragility under mechanical and chemical stresses, the genetic and biochemical characteristics of FDCs remain unclear. Previously, we identified FDCs as ICAM-1+ cells in the CD45− non-hematopoietic cell fraction from naïve mouse spleen after cell separation by means of digestion with a combination of enzymes. In the present study, using a new combination of enzymes, we found that FDCs are highly enriched in the CD45−ICAM-1+CD21/35+ cell fraction. CD45−ICAM-1+CD21/35+ cells in the mouse spleen retained an antigen administered in vivo for more than 7 days. Moreover, CD45−ICAM-1+CD21/35+ cells isolated from the spleen of mice administered with a cognate antigen enhanced the survival and proliferation of antigen-specific B cells in vitro. Our improved protocol for the isolation of naïve FDCs will be useful for the analysis of FDCs in vitro and in vivo.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantigens 3adendritic cells 3aenzymes 3ahumoral immunity 3amice 3anew combination 3apopulation size 3aspleen 0aFollicular dendritic cells 0aIsolation methods 0aStromal cells 0aAntigen presentation 0aAntigen retention1 aHonda, Shin-ichiro1 aShibuya, Akira1 aShibuya, Kazuko0 tMolecular Immunology.g2016 Oct., v. 78 p.140-145dElsevier Ltdx0161-58907nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.molimm.2016.09.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01793naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100002200137245010900159300001600268500002000284520070800304592002801012650002701040650001201067650002201079650002101101650001101122650001601133650001801149650001101167650002301178700001901201773014301220856007101363852000901434655001201443IND60680229620221120171207.0200104e197008  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068022962DNAL7 a10.2307/12373882doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTomek, William G.10aTemporal Relationships Among Prices on Commodity Futures Markets: Their Allocative and Stabilizing Roles  ap. 372-380.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe role that futures markets play in guiding inventories, through hedging, has been emphasized in economic literature. Historically, futures markets first emerged for the annual crops that could be continuously stored (grain and cotton); hence inventory hedging has been important from the outset. But forward pricing which was not attendant upon inventories has long been practiced, and the more recent emergence of futures markets for non‐inventory commodities dramatizes this fact. We show here that the model of intertemporal price relationships differs for the two cases and provide evidence for selected commodities. The contrasting implications for allocation and stabilization are also drawn.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural economics 3aannuals 3acommodity futures 3acommodity prices 3acotton 3ainventories 3amarket prices 3amodels 3atemporal variation1 aGray, Roger W.0 tAmerican journal of agricultural economics.g1970 Aug., v. 52, no. 3 p.372-380dOxford University PresswJournal:jnl44932x0002-90927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2307/12373883Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02066naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100001800112245013100130300001600261520080400277592002801081650001201109650002801121650002101149650002601170650001101196650001701207650001301224650002501237650002101262650001501283650002701298650001001325650001901335651001001354653002201364653002001386653001401406653002601420700001801446700002401464700001801488773010501506852000901611655001201620IND60706052420221122162921.0200807e201407  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070605242DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBhavya, M.

PlGF-targeting via nanobody (Nb) therefore could be beneficial to modulate these pathologies. In this work, phage-display and computational approach was employed to develop a high affinity PlGF-specific Nb. An Nb library was constructed against human recombinant PlGF (rPlGF). After panning on immobilized rPlGF the periplasmic-extract (PE) of individual colonies were screened by ELISA (PE-ELISA). The 3D structures of selected Nbs were then homology modeled and energy minimized using the AMBER force field. Binding score calculations were also assessed to reveal possible Nb-PlGF interactions. Via ELISA-based affinity/specificity determinations, the best-qualified Nb was further evaluated by proliferation, migration, 3D capillary formation, invasion assays and on Chick chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) model. An immune library of 1.5×107 individual Nb clones was constructed. By PE-ELISA 12 clones with strong signals were selected. Three out of 12 sequenced Nbs (Nb-C13, Nb-C18 and Nb-C62) showed high binding scores ranging between −378.7 and −461kcal/mol. Compared to a control Nb, Nb-C18 significantly inhibited proliferation, migration and the 3D-capillary formation of HUVEC cells (p<0.05) with an EC50 of 35nM, 42nM and 24nM and invasion of MDA-MB231was significantly suppressed (p<0.05) with an EC50 of57nM. The result of the CAM assay shows that Nb-C18 could inhibit the vascular formation in the chicken chorioallantoic membrane. This Nb can be used as anti-angiogenesis agent in future.  aPublisher supplied data 3aangiogenesis 3aantigens 3acell growth 3achickens 3achicks 3achorioallantoic membrane 3aclones 3aenergy 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3ahuman umbilical vein endothelial cells 3ahumans 3amedian effective concentration 3ametastasis 3amodels 3aneoplasms 3avascular endothelial growth factors 0aAngiogenesis 0aPlGF 0aNanobody 0aComputational analysis 0aPhage display1 aMahdian, Reza1 aZeinali, Sirous1 aHassanzadeh-Ghassabeh, Gholamreza1 aMansouri, Kamran1 aKhanahmad, Hossein1 aNamvar-asl, Nabiollah1 aRahimi, Hamzeh1 aBehdani, Mahdi1 aCohan, Reza Ahangari1 aEavazalipour, Mehdi1 aRamazani, Ali1 aMuyldermans, Serge0 tMolecular Immunology.g2016 Oct., v. 78 p.183-192dElsevier Ltdx0161-58907nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.molimm.2016.09.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01659naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100002000137245009900157300001600256500002000272520066700292592002800959650004600987650002701033650001701060650001601077650001501093650002601108773014301134856007101277852000901348655001201357IND60680229720221120171045.0200104e197008  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068022972DNAL7 a10.2307/12373902doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLove, Harold G.14aThe Reasons Participants Drop Out of the Food Stamp Program: A Case Study and Its Implications  ap. 387-394.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aIn 1967–69 about one‐fourth of all potentially eligible households participated in the St. Louis food stamp program. The annual turnover rate approximated 100 percent. The bulk of households receiving public assistance payments dropped from the food stamp program because of inability to purchase coupons. Most nonrecipients of public assistance left the program because income lifted them from eligibility. The large majority of low‐income households usually spent more for food than food stamps would have cost, but most households could not meet the program's regular participation requirement.

Density functional theory (DFT) computations are applied to elucidate the underlying mechanism of the role of dopants in facilitating ceria based redox cycles; specifically, we explain why some dopants increase performance, while others do not. Firstly, we find that Zr and Hf dopants increase the oxygen exchange capacity of ceria because they store energy in tensilely strained Zr– or Hf–O bonds which is released upon O-vacancy formation. This finding corrects a long held assumption that Zr and Hf decrease the O-vacancy formation energy by compensating for ceria expansion upon reduction. Although the released strain energy decreases the O-vacancy formation energy, O-vacancy formation remains sufficiently endothermic to split H₂O and CO₂. Secondly, we show that two electrons must be promoted into the high energy Ce f-band during reduction if the O-vacancies are to store sufficient energy to drive the oxidative gas splitting step. This means that di- and trivalent dopants are not suitable for this process. Lastly, we show that dopants which break O bonds due to their small size or strongly covalent character, such as Ti and the pentavalent dopants, substantially decrease the O-vacancy formation energy because only three O bonds must break during reduction. These vacancies, therefore, are too low in energy to drive gas splitting. Based on these findings, we develop guidelines for new ceria doping strategies to facilitate solar thermochemical gas splitting cycles.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon dioxide 3achemical bonding 3adensity functional theory 3aelectrons 3aendothermy 3aenergy 3aguidelines 3aoxygen 3azirconium1 aSteinfeld, Aldo0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2017 Aug. 1, v. 5, no. 30 p.15578-15590dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c7ta04000h3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02872naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001300142245009600155300002000251520124900271592002801520650001701548650001501565650002101580650003001601650001201631650002101643650001301664650001501677650001301692650001301705700006201718700001801780700002301798700001601821700002201837700007101859700006201930700006101992700006202053700006402115773014902179856007702328852000902405655001202414IND60759336520221117223335.0211208e20211123xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075933652DNAL7 a10.1021/jacs.1c102552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Hu10aSelective Separation of Lithium Chloride by Organogels Containing Strapped Calix[4]pyrroles  ap. 20403-20410.  aReported herein are two functionalized crown ether strapped calix[4]pyrroles, H1 and H2. As inferred from competitive salt binding experiments carried out in nitrobenzene-d₅ and acetonitrile-d₃, these hosts capture LiCl selectively over four other test salts, viz. NaCl, KCl, MgCl₂, and CaCl₂. Support for the selectivity came from density functional theory (DFT) calculations carried out in a solvent continuum. These theoretical analyses revealed a higher innate affinity for LiCl in the case of H1, but a greater selectivity relative to NaCl in the case of H2, recapitulating that observed experimentally. Receptors H1 and H2 were outfitted with methacrylate handles and subject to copolymerization with acrylate monomers and cross-linkers to yield gels, G1 and G2, respectively. These two gels were found to adsorb lithium chloride preferentially from an acetonitrile solution containing a mixture of LiCl, NaCl, KCl, MgCl₂, and CaCl₂ and then release the lithium chloride in methanol. The gels could then be recycled for reuse in the selective adsorption of LiCl. As such, the present study highlights the use of solvent polarity switching to drive separations with potential applications in lithium purification and recycling.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetonitrile 3aadsorption 3acopolymerization 3adensity functional theory 3alithium 3alithium chloride 3amethanol 3aorganogels 3apyrroles 3asolvents1 aJones, Leighton O.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6657-26321 aHwang, Inhong1 aAllen, Marshall J.1 aTao, Daliao1 aLynch, Vincent M.1 aFreeman, B.

Here, we comparatively evaluated the two sampling methods, cold methanol quenching and fast filtration, for one of the most important industrial microorganisms, yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The latter, using a vacuum manifold system capable of processing up to twenty samples simultaneously, was developed here. The results showed that the cold methanol quenching method resulted in severe losses of intracellular metabolites but that sugars and sugar phosphates were highly preserved. In comparison, the fast filtration method better preserved most metabolites with less extracellular contamination. Our results suggested that the fast filtration method with a vacuum manifold system can be widely applied to yeast metabolome analysis due to its simplicity, robustness, and lack of significant intracellular metabolite loss.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3acold 3afiltration 3ametabolism 3ametabolites 3ametabolome 3ametabolomics 3amethanol 3ayeasts 0aMetabolome sample preparation 0aSampling method 0aCold methanol quenching 0aFast filtration 0aGas chromatography–mass spectrometry1 aSeo, Seung-Oh1 aKwak, Suryang1 aOh, Eun Joong1 aLee, Sun-Hee1 aJin, Yong-Su1 aKim, Kyoung Heon1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4600-86680 tProcess biochemistry.g2021 Nov., v. 110 p.195-200dElsevier LtdwJournal:12511x1359-51137nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.procbio.2021.08.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03790naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245012100165300001600286520210500302592002802407650001202435650002502447650002602472650002802498650001302526650001602539650002402555650002002579650002502599650001402624650001802638650004302656650005202699650000902751650002202760650001802782650001702800650001502817650002102832650001102853650001302864650001502877651001002892700001602902700001502918700002002933700001602953700001502969700001302984773013602997856008203133852000903215655001203224IND60588743220221120024449.0180619e201801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058874322DNAL7 a10.1007/s11368-017-1716-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYou, Tingting10aEffects of metal oxide nanoparticles on soil enzyme activities and bacterial communities in two different soil types  ap. 211-221.  aPURPOSE: With the increased availability of nanoparticle-based products, their releases to soil are undoubtedly inevitable. Among the nanoparticle-based products, potential risks of metal oxide nanoparticles (MO-ENPs) have attracted increasing concerns. However, their effects on soil and soil microorganisms remain largely unknown. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this study, four metal oxide nanoparticles, i.e., zinc oxide nanoparticles (nZnO), titanium dioxide nanoparticles (nTiO₂), cerium dioxide nanoparticles (nCeO₂), and magnetite nanoparticles (nFe₃O₄), were enrolled to evaluate their impact on soil enzyme activities (invertase, urease, catalase, and phosphatase) and bacterial communities in two typical soils from northeast China (black soil and saline-alkali soil). The community structure and size were analyzed using pyrosequencing and real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The soils were exposed to metal oxide nanoparticles at 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 mg g⁻¹ for 15 and 30 days. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: In general, nZnO had a stronger effect on soil enzymatic activities than nTiO₂, nCeO₂, and nFe₃O₄, and saline-alkali soil was more susceptible to metal oxide nanoparticles than black soil. In RT-PCR analysis, a significant decrease (41.66, 36.34, and 47.99%, respectively) on total bacteria population was only observed in saline-alkali soil treated by 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 mg g⁻¹ nZnO. Meanwhile, pyrosequencing analysis revealed that the samples of saline-alkali soil treated with nZnO showed high variance in their bacterial community composition, e.g., Bacilli, Alphaproteobacteria, and Gammaproteobacteria class. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggested that metal oxide nanoparticle incubation could influence soil enzyme activities and change soil bacterial community. Moreover, the soil type was a key component dictating the effect of metal oxide nanoparticles on the bacterial community composition and size. These findings are of great help towards building a comprehensive understanding of the potential environmental risks of metal oxide nanoparticles.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacilli 3aalpha-Proteobacteria 3abacterial communities 3abeta-fructofuranosidase 3acatalase 3aceric oxide 3acommunity structure 3aenzyme activity 3agamma-Proteobacteria 3amagnetite 3ananoparticles 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3arisk 3asequence analysis 3asoil bacteria 3asoil enzymes 3asoil types 3atitanium dioxide 3aurease 3avariance 3azinc oxide 3aChina1 aLiu, Dandan1 aChen, Jing1 aYang, Zhongzhou1 aDou, Runzhi1 aGao, Xiang1 aWang, Li0 tJournal of soils and sediments.g2018 Jan., v. 18, no. 1 p.211-221dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl3949862x1439-01087nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11368-017-1716-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04187naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245009400172300001600266520242700282592002802709650001402737650002002751650001902771650001902790650002302809650000902832650001202841650001102853650002002864650002302884650002202907650001902929650001402948650001602962650001002978650002402988650002403012650001503036650001803051650002003069653001803089653001903107653001903126653002203145653002203167653001603189700002403205700002703229700006103256700001903317700002003336700002503356773010903381856008603490852000903576655001203585IND60585761020221118084428.0190318e201801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058576102DNAL7 a10.1016/j.soilbio.2017.10.0412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAhmed, Mutez Ali10aSoil microorganisms exhibit enzymatic and priming response to root mucilage under drought  ap. 410-418.  aAlthough root mucilage plays a prominent role in soil-plant-water relations, especially under drought, its persistence in soil and its microbial decomposition remain unknown. The aim of this study was to investigate: 1) the effect of soil moisture on mucilage decomposition, 2) the effect of mucilage on enzyme activities, and 3) the effect of mucilage on soil organic matter (SOM) decomposition. We hypothesized that mucilage benefits soil microorganisms by compensating for the detrimental effects of drought. Consequently, low water content was expected to reduce SOM mineralization and enzyme activities only in soil without mucilage. High moisture was predicted to support high microbial activities and therefore rapid decomposition of the mucilage. Two doses of maize root mucilage (40 and 200 μg C g−1 soil; C4 plant derived) were added to a C3 soil at optimum moisture (80% WHC) and under drought (30% WHC) to test these hypotheses.Under optimum moisture conditions, CO2 efflux from soil increased in proportion to mucilage addition. In contrast, there was no effect of mucilage on CO2 efflux under drought. At 80% WHC, mucilage was nearly completely decomposed (98% and 88% for low and high dose, respectively) after 15 days. Drought significantly suppressed mucilage mineralization. Microbial uptake of mucilage C was independent of soil moisture, suggesting that its bioavailability is regulated not by the water content of the whole soil, but by the water within the swollen mucilage. The high mucilage dose increased microbial biomass at both moisture levels compared to the soil without mucilage. Positive priming of soil organic matter decomposition was induced by mucilage at 80% WHC, whereas at 30% WHC, mucilage caused slightly negative priming. Mucilage addition counteracted the decrease of enzyme activities at 30% WHC, and so, stabilized the catalytic activity irrespective of soil moisture content.We conclude that mucilage provides biofilm-like properties that maintain microbial and exoenzymatic activities, even under drought. The slow decomposition of mucilage in drying soils suggests that mucilage maintains moist conditions around the roots for a long period, supporting beneficial root-microbial interactions at low water availability. This would result in a positive ecological feedback for microbial life in the rhizosphere and enhance nutrient release for roots under water scarcity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aC4 plants 3abioavailability 3abiodegradation 3acarbon dioxide 3acatalytic activity 3acorn 3adrought 3adrying 3aenzyme activity 3amicrobial activity 3amicrobial biomass 3amineralization 3amucilages 3arhizosphere 3aroots 3asoil microorganisms 3asoil organic matter 3asoil water 3awater content 3awater shortages 0aRoot mucilage 0aDrought stress 0aPriming effect 0aMicrobial biomass 0aEnzyme activities 0aMaize roots1 aSanaullah, Muhammad1 aBlagodatskaya, Evgenia1 aMason-Jones, Kyle1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2032-86711 aJawad, Husnain1 aKuzyakov, Yakov1 aDippold, Michaela A.0 tSoil biology & biochemistry.g2018 Jan., v. 116 p.410-418dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl124x0038-07177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.soilbio.2017.10.0413Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02770naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002600148245008000174300001800254500001900272520130600291592002801597650001201625650001901637650001601656650002801672650001101700650001801711650002601729650003001755650001501785650001401800700002701814700003001841700002601871700002701897700002801924700003501952700002801987700002702015700006702042773011202109856008202221852000902303655001202312IND60715642820221119212534.0201030e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071564282DNAL7 a10.1007/s11119-020-09724-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCortez, Lucas Aguilar10aSubsoiling of an oxisol at fixed and varying depth in areas under sugarcane  ap. 1351-1365.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aKnowledge of the spatial variability of compaction would minimize the movement of soil and optimize the operation and economic viability of sugarcane activities. The present study aimed to evaluate different protocols for soil loosening, using subsoiling at fixed and varying depths. The following four protocols were assessed: (i) total area subsoiling with a 7-shank sub-soiler at a fixed depth of 0.4 m in both row and inter-row zones; (ii) total area subsoiling with a 7-shank sub-soiler at varying depths in both row and inter-row zones; (iii) localized subsoiling with a 4-shank sub-soiler at a fixed depth of 0.4 m in a row; and (iv) localized subsoiling with a 4-shank sub-soiler at varying depths in a row. Soil resistance to penetration was measured at 111 sites within a 10 ha area, at a depth of 0.4 m. Data were subjected to descriptive and geostatistical analyses. Localized subsoiling at varying depths had an operational capacity 61.7% greater than the total area operation at a fixed depth. Moreover, along with producing a savings of 57.1% for diesel oil, the emission of equivalent CO₂ was reduced by approximately the same amount. Mapping based on site-specific management presented good sustainability indicators, such as reduced energy consumption and lower CO₂ emission.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOxisols 3acarbon dioxide 3adiesel fuel 3aeconomic sustainability 3aenergy 3ageostatistics 3aprecision agriculture 3aresistance to penetration 3asubsoilers 3asugarcane1 aMarques Júnior, José1 aPeluco, Rafael Gonçalves1 aSiqueira, Diego Silva1 aSiansi, Frederico Luiz1 aBarbosa, Ronny Sobreira1 aFurlani, Carlos Eduardo Angeli1 aCamargo, Lívia Arantes1 aSilva, Laércio Santos1 aGomes, Romário Pimenta1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0663-09620 tPrecision agriculture.g2020 Dec., v. 21, no. 6 p.1351-1365dSpringer USwJournal:jnl58474x1385-22567nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11119-020-09724-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01753naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100002100137245006400158300001600222500002000238520066100258592002800919650002700947650002300974650001900997650002101016650001801037650001701055650001701072650001801089650002401107651001701131700002001148773014301168856007101311852000901382655001201391IND60680229920221120171048.0200104e197008  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068022992DNAL7 a10.2307/12373872doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBarron, James C.10aImpact of Public Land Programs on Local Government Finances  ap. 365-371.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aPublic land ownership is often assumed to adversely affect the fiscal capacity of local governments through removal of part of the property tax base. A method employing multiple regression analysis was developed to test this hypothesis in a forested region of Pennsylvania. Neither higher tax rates on private land nor reduced levels of per capita local government expenditures were found to be associated with large amounts of public land, thereby indicating that local governments are not placed at an economic disadvantage by public land programs. Extended use of this analytical technique could result in better public policy decisions on resource use.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural economics 3aanalytical methods 3aland ownership 3alocal government 3aprivate lands 3aproperty tax 3apublic lands 3apublic policy 3aregression analysis 3aPennsylvania1 aJansma, J.

The effects of firing temperature on the phase components, cation disorder, and crystal defects, and their relationship with the electrochemical performance of the cathode material were studied. The sample fired at 650 °C showed the highest capacity of up to 320 mA h g⁻¹ and highest initial coulombic efficiency (98%, 2–4.9 V), but the capacity decreased dramatically to only 55% after 50 cycles. The sample fired at 850 °C showed the slowest activation of the layered phase, requiring up to several dozen cycles. The intermediate firing temperature of 750 °C showed a balance between the activation rate, capacity, initial coulombic efficiency, and cycling stability, with 270 mA h g⁻¹ after 10 cycles and a 99% capacity retention after 50 cycles. All samples showed different rates of the layered-to-spinel phase transformation, which depends on the activation rate. This study reports the relationships between synthesis conditions, structure, and electrochemical performance, providing a strategy to develop high-capacity cathode materials based on the (1 − x)Li₁.₂Mn₀.₆Ni₀.₂O₂·xLiMn₁.₅Ni₀.₅O₄ system.  aPublisher supplied data 3acathodes 3acations 3aelectrochemistry 3alithium batteries 3aphase transition 3atemperature1 aArunkumar, Paulraj1 aIm, Jong Chan1 aNgo, Duc Tung1 aLe, Hang T.

Nevertheless, optimization of MRM parameters remains as a time and labor-intensive task particularly in multiplexed quantitative analysis of small molecules in complex mixtures. In this study, we have developed an approach named Stepped MSAll Relied Transition (SMART) to predict the optimal MRM parameters of small molecules. SMART requires firstly a rapid and high-throughput analysis of samples using a Stepped MSAll technique (sMSAll) on a Q-TOF, which consists of serial MSAll events acquired from low CE to gradually stepped-up CE values in a cycle. The optimal CE values can then be determined by comparing the extracted ion chromatograms for the ion pairs of interest among serial scans. The SMART-predicted parameters were found to agree well with the parameters optimized on a triple quadrupole from the same vendor using a mixture of standards. The parameters optimized on a triple quadrupole from a different vendor was also employed for comparison, and found to be linearly correlated with the SMART-predicted parameters, suggesting the potential applications of the SMART approach among different instrumental platforms. This approach was further validated by applying to simultaneous quantification of 31 herbal components in the plasma of rats treated with a herbal prescription. Because the sMSAll acquisition can be accomplished in a single run for multiple components independent of standards, the SMART approach are expected to find its wide application in the multiplexed quantitative analysis of complex mixtures.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanalytical chemistry 3amass spectrometry 3amonitoring 3aquantitative analysis 3arats 0aStepped MSAll 0aStepped MSAll Relied Transition (SMART) 0aMultiple reaction monitoring (MRM) 0aQ-TOF 0aQuantitative analysis 0aComplex mixture 0asMSAll 0aSMART 0aQQQ 0aQ-TOF 0aHR 0aMS1 aZhu, Lin1 aWang, Lin1 aLiu, Huiying1 aZhang, Jun1 aWu, Mengqiu1 aWang, Guangji1 aHao, Haiping0 tAnalytica chimica acta.g2016 Feb. 11, v. 907 p.60-68dElsevier B.V.x0003-26707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aca.2015.11.0453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03065naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001300144245013100157300002000288500001900308520155200327592002801879650001901907650002301926650001101949650003001960650001601990650001402006650001502020650001802035653002502053653001202078653003102090653000802121653002002129700001502149700001802164700001302182700005702195700007002252700005602322773014202378856007802520852000902598655001202607IND60720159320221120143849.0201209e20201124xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072015932DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.0c141472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Li10aExploiting Co Defects in CoFe-Layered Double Hydroxide (CoFe-LDH) Derivatives for Highly Efficient Photothermal Cancer Therapy  ap. 54916-54926.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aCurrently, two-dimensional materials are being actively pursued in catalysis and other fields due their abundance of defects, which results in enhanced performance relative to their bulk defect-free counterparts. To date, the exploitation of defects in two-dimensional materials to enhance photothermal therapies has received little attention, motivating a detailed investigation. Herein, we successfully fabricated a series of novel CoFe-based photothermal agents (CoFe-x) by heating CoFe-layered double hydroxide (CoFe-LDH) nanosheets at different temperatures (x) between 200–800 °C under a Ar atmosphere. The CoFe-x products differed in their particle size, cobalt defect concentration, and electronic structure, with the CoFe-500 product containing the highest concentration of Co²⁺ defects and most efficient photothermal performance under near-infrared (NIR, 808 nm) irradiation. Experiments and density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed that Co²⁺ defects modify the electronic structure of CoFe-x, narrowing the band gap and thus increasing the nonradiative recombination rate, thereby improving the NIR-driven photothermal properties. In vitro and in vivo results demonstrated that CoFe-500 was an efficient agent for photothermal cancer treatment and also near-infrared (NIR) thermal imaging, magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, and photoacoustic (PA) imaging. This work provides valuable new insights about the role of defects in the rational design of nanoagents with optimized structures for improved cancer therapy.  aPublisher supplied data 3acancer therapy 3acatalytic activity 3acobalt 3adensity functional theory 3airradiation 3amagnetism 3ananosheets 3aparticle size 0aphotothermal therapy 0adefects 0atopological transformation 0aLDH 0atwo-dimensional1 aXu, Si-Min1 aYang, Xueting1 aHe, Shan1 aGuan, Shanyue1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9842-79821 aWaterhouse, Geoffrey I.

The effects of bulk solvent composition of the mobile phase, the nature of base additives, counterion concentration, and the structure of selector on the enantiorecognition were studied. Experiments were performed at constant mobile phase composition in the temperature range 5–40°C to study the effect of temperature. Thermodynamic parameters were calculated on the basis of the plots of ln α versus 1/T curves. The enthalpically or entropically driven enantioseparations were found to depend strongly on the structures of analyte and selector. The eight stereoisomers of limonene‐based carbocyclic β‐amino acids could be differentiated as well‐separated peaks in a traditional 1D chromatographic system in two runs by applying the two complementary ZWIX(+)™ and ZWIX(–)™ columns.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCinchona 3aadditives 3aamino acids 3aliquid chromatography 3asolvents 3astereoisomers 3atemperature 3athermodynamics 3azwitterions1 aOrosz, Tímea,1 aUgrai, Imre1 aSzakonyi, Zsolt1 aFülöp, Ferenc1 aLindner, Wolfgang1 aPéter, Antal1 aIlisz, István0 tJournal of separation science.g2017 Aug., v. 40, no. 16 p.3196-3204dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx1615-93067nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jssc.2017004503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02454naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001800152245017700170300001600347520114700363592002801510650002601538650002701564650001301591650002101604650001701625650001601642650002801658650002601686650001001712650002601722653002501748653001001773653002401783653001701807653000901824700002001833773009501853856008701948852000902035655001202044IND60532107120221120192915.0190408e201701  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053210712DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodcont.2016.07.0222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, Hyun-Gyu10aCombined treatment with chlorine dioxide gas, fumaric acid, and ultraviolet-C light for inactivating Escherichia coli O157:H7 and Listeria monocytogenes inoculated on plums  ap. 371-375.  aCombined non-thermal treatment with chlorine dioxide (ClO2) gas, ultraviolet-C (UV-C) light, and fumaric acid was performed to inactivate Listeria monocytogenes and Escherichia coli O157:H7 inoculated on plums. Plums were treated with ClO2 gas (15 and 30 ppmv), fumaric acid (0.1, 0.3, and 0.5%), and by UV-C irradiation (3, 5, and 10 kJ/m2). The single treatments with 15 or 30 ppmv ClO2 gas, 0.5% fumaric acid, and 10 kJ/m2 UV-C decreased the population of L. monocytogenes by 1.78, 2.00, 1.65, and 1.62 log CFU/g, respectively, and the population of E. coli O157:H7 by 1.73, 1.81, 1.34, and 2.07 log CFU/g, respectively. In addition, combined treatments reduced the populations of the pathogenic bacteria more than each treatment alone. In particular, the combined treatment with ClO2 gas (30 ppmv) for 20 min, fumaric acid (0.5%), and UV-C (10 kJ/m2) decreased the populations of L. monocytogenes and E. coli O157:H7 by 6.26 and 5.48 log CFU/g, respectively. These results suggest that combined treatment with ClO2 gas, UV-C light, and fumaric acid may be a useful hurdle technology to enhance the microbiological safety of plums.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli O157 3aListeria monocytogenes 3abacteria 3achlorine dioxide 3afumaric acid 3airradiation 3amicrobiological quality 3anonthermal processing 3aplums 3aultraviolet radiation 0aChlorine dioxide gas 0aPlums 0aPathogenic bacteria 0aFumaric acid 0aUV-C1 aSong, Kyung Bin0 tFood control.g2017 Jan., v. 71 p.371-375dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl56242x0956-71357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodcont.2016.07.0223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02769naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245018200167300001600349520112200365592002801487650003401515650004401549650003301593650002201626650001701648650001601665650002401681650003201705650000901737650002101746650001901767650001501786650000701801650001301808650002001821650001101841650001901852700001801871700001901889700002701908700002001935700002101955700003501976700001802011773014302029856008202172852000902254655001202263IND60590098920221116200740.0180619e201803  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059009892DNAL7 a10.1007/s00449-017-1873-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJang, Eun-Young10aImproved biosynthesis of silver nanoparticles using keratinase from Stenotrophomonas maltophilia R13: reaction optimization, structural characterization, and biomedical activity  ap. 381-393.  aIn the present study, keratinase from Stenotrophomonas maltophilia R13 was used for the first time as a reducing agent for the eco-friendly synthesis of AgNPs. The keratinase produced by strain R13 was responsible for the reduction of silver ions and the subsequent formation of AgNPs. Maximum AgNP synthesis was achieved using 2 mM AgNO₃ at pH 9 and 40 °C. Electron microscopy and dynamic light scattering analysis showed AgNPs were spherical and of average diameter ~ 8.4 nm. X-ray diffraction revealed that AgNPs were crystalline. FTIR indicated AgNPs were stabilized by proteins present in the crude enzyme solution of strain R13. AgNPs exhibited a broad antimicrobial spectrum against several pathogenic microorganisms, and the antimicrobial mechanism appeared to involve structural deformation of cells resulting in membrane leakage and subsequent lysis. AgNPs also displayed 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (IC₅₀ = 0.0112 mg/ml), 2,2′-azinobis-3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonate radical scavenging (IC₅₀ = 0.0243 mg/ml), and anti-collagenase (IC₅₀ = 23.5 mg/ml) activities.  aPublisher supplied data 3a2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aStenotrophomonas maltophilia 3aX-ray diffraction 3abiosynthesis 3adeformation 3aelectron microscopy 3ainhibitory concentration 50 3aions 3alight scattering 3amicroorganisms 3ananosilver 3apH 3aproteins 3areducing agents 3asilver 3asilver nitrate1 aSon, Yong-Jun1 aPark, Soo-Yeun1 aYoo, Michelle Ji Yeon,1 aCho, Young Nam,1 aJeong, Seong-Yun1 aLau, R.

Deciduous, star-shaped spines named “caltrop cornuti” (CC) are known in about 400 species of Lepidoptera and their function is unknown. The evolutionary history of CC is reviewed; these structures have appeared independently several times, in some cases having been lost and regained. Their deciduous design, production cost and potential risk of damage resulting from their acute spines suggest that CC evolved by natural and/or sexual selection. Five functional hypotheses are discussed. Comparative morphological data, obtained from systematic studies, and original observations are used to assess some assumptions and predictions of the hypotheses.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLepidoptera 3aanimals 3acopulation 3afemale genitalia 3afemales 3amale genitalia 3amales 3aprediction 3aproduction costs 3arisk 3asexual selection 0aLepidoptera 0amale genitalia 0asexual selection 0asexual conflict 0anatural selection1 aMiller, James S.0 tJournal of natural history.g2012 Mar. 1, v. 46, no. 11-12 p.701-715dTaylor & Francisx1464-52627nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00222933.2011.651638  aDNAL 7aarticle02182naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001800152245010000170300001300270520109300283592002801376650001401404650001701418650001601435650001501451650000901466650001201475650001801487650001601505650001101521650001801532650001101550700002401561773010501585856008601690990002301776852000901799655001201808IND60113273620221120052727.0141111e20131215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011327362DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jelechem.2013.09.0352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSpinner, Neil10aNanostructural effects on the cycle life and Li⁺ diffusion coefficient of nickel oxide anodes  ap. 8-16.  aThe nanostructure of nickel oxide was controlled using two different synthesis methods and its influence on cyclability, charge/discharge capacity and mass transport of Li⁺ ions at the Li-ion battery anode was examined. Effective diffusion coefficients were calculated using the current pulse relaxation technique and a new model was derived and applied to deconvolute the mass transport of Li⁺ through the NiO and Li₂O+Ni phases. The NiO phase diffusion coefficients were found to be independent of the material geometry; however, the diffusion coefficient of Li⁺ in the Li₂O+Ni phase was strongly dependent on the electrode geometry. Results suggest that controlled nanosized crystallites of NiO are preferred as they result in smaller average grain boundary sizes for the Li₂O+Ni phase formed during cell charging. This has several benefits including better accessibility of the Li₂O+Ni phase during discharge, yielding improved cycle life, a decreased Li⁺ path length leading to lower tortuosity and a larger grain boundary area allowing more in-plane Li⁺ transport.  aPublisher supplied data 3abatteries 3acrystallites 3adiffusivity 3aelectrodes 3aions 3alithium 3amass transfer 3amethodology 3amodels 3ananomaterials 3anickel1 aMustain, William E.0 tJournal of electroanalytical chemistry.g2013 Dec. 15, v. 711 p.8-16dElsevier B.V.x1572-66577nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jelechem.2013.09.0353Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01551naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001400139245010700153300001800260520050000278592002800778650002400806650001400830650002300844650002200867650002200889650001700911700001900928700001300947700001600960700002100976700001500997773010501012856007501117852000901192655001201201IND60578841820221122010307.0170814e20140321xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057884182DNAL7 a10.1021/ol500464x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Qiong10aCopper-Catalyzed Carboxamide-Directed Ortho Amination of Anilines with Alkylamines at Room Temperature  ap. 1764-1767.  aIn this report, a highly efficient method for the room temperature installation of alkyl amino motifs onto the ortho position of anilines via Cu-catalyzed carboxamide-directed amination with alkylamines is described.

Diagnostic material of 15 abortion or stillbirth cases with suspected diagnosis of WFFS was available for this study. Additionally, there were examinations in 37 cases where there were no indications of WFFS when submitted for routine diagnostic procedures. Foals in all cases were genotyped and external morphological defects were recorded. Amongst the 15 cases in which WFSS was suspected, there were 14 homozygous foetuses with the WFFS allele (WFFS/WFFS). Three heterozygous WFFS foetuses (N/WFFS) were detected in the cases submitted for routine diagnostic procedures. Of the 14 WFFS homozygous foetuses, 11 of mares had a gestation length of at least 320 days. Nine foals were born alive but died within a short time. Skin defects were obvious in 12 WFFS homozygous foals, and there was abnormal flexibility in the digital joints, flexed forelegs and incomplete closure of the abdominal wall in five, four, and one of the foals, respectively. In conclusion, the predominant manifestation of WFFS are death during the latter stages of gestation or live births with foals being non-viable. Losses in Warmblood horse breeding caused by WFFS are greater than previously assumed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalleles 3adeath 3afetal death 3afetus 3afoals 3agenotyping 3agestation period 3aheterozygosity 3ahomozygosity 3ahorse breeding 3ainheritance (genetics) 3amares 3apregnancy 3asigns and symptoms (animals and humans) 0aHorse 0aWFFS 0aPregnancy 0aFoal 0aStillbirth1 aMüller-Herbst, Stefanie1 aReineking, Wencke1 aMüller, Elisabeth,1 aWohlsein, Peter1 aGunreben, Bärbel1 aAurich, Jörg,0 tAnimal reproduction science.g2019 Dec., v. 211 p.106202-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl11636x0378-43207nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.anireprosci.2019.1062023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02576naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002300140245008400163520151100247592002801758650002101786650001701807650001301824650001201837650001401849650002201863650002001885650001401905700002001919700002501939700002001964700003401984773012402018856007502142852000902217655001202226IND60754304520221120151345.0211023e20210928xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075430452DNAL7 a10.3390/nu131034212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWilson, Rebekah L.10aFasting and Exercise in Oncology: Potential Synergism of Combined Interventions  aNutrition and exercise interventions are strongly recommended for most cancer patients; however, much debate exists about the best prescription. Combining fasting with exercise is relatively untouched within the oncology setting. Separately, fasting has demonstrated reductions in chemotherapy-related side effects and improved treatment tolerability and effectiveness. Emerging evidence suggests fasting may have a protective effect on healthy cells allowing chemotherapy to exclusively target cancer cells. Exercise is commonly recommended and attenuates treatment- and cancer-related adverse changes to body composition, quality of life, and physical function. Given their independent benefits, in combination, fasting and exercise may induce synergistic effects and further improve cancer-related outcomes. In this narrative review, we provide a critical appraisal of the current evidence of fasting and exercise as independent interventions in the cancer population and discuss the potential benefits and mechanisms of combined fasting and exercise on cardiometabolic, body composition, patient-reported outcomes, and cancer-related outcomes. Our findings suggest that within the non-cancer population combined fasting and exercise is a viable strategy to improve health-related outcomes, however, its safety and efficacy in the oncology setting remain unknown. Therefore, we also provide a discussion on potential safety issues and considerations for future research in the growing cancer population.  aPublisher supplied data 3abody composition 3adrug therapy 3aexercise 3afasting 3anutrition 3aprotective effect 3aquality of life 3asynergism1 aKang, Dong-Woo 1 aChristopher, Cami N.1 aCrane, Tracy E.1 aDieli-Conwright, Christina M.0 tNutrients.g2021 Sept. 28, v. 13, no. 10dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2271x2072-66437nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu131034213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03188naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001800144245011800162300002000280500001500300520190400315592002802219650001402247650002202261650001902283650001902302650002802321650001202349653001302361653002102374653001702395653001702412700001602429700001702445700001502462700001602477700005602493773014202549856007802691852000902769655001202778IND60720159720221120143734.0201209e20201130xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072015972DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.0c143802doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWeng, Mingcen10aProgrammable and Self-Healing Light-Driven Actuators through Synergetic Use of Water-Shaping and -Welding Methods  ap. 55125-55133.  agolden set  aShape programming is critical for the fabrication of a light-driven actuator with complex shape morphing, which demonstrates potential applications in remote-controlled light-driven soft robots. However, it remains a huge challenge to obtain light-driven actuators having advantages of complex shape morphing, self-healing function, and facile fabrication simultaneously. Here, we report a facile strategy to obtain programmable and self-healing light-driven actuators with complex shape morphing. Various initial shapes of actuators can be programmed by synergetic use of water-shaping and -welding methods, which provides unlimited opportunities for fabricating actuators with predesigned shapes and subsequently demonstrating complex shape morphing. A template transfer method is used to prepare a single-layer graphene oxide (GO) film with asymmetric surface structures, which acts as the basic actuator and has the self-healing function based on the hydrophilic property of GO. It shows bending morphing under near-infrared (NIR) light irradiation due to the photothermal effect and asymmetric morphology on the opposite surfaces. Four more types of actuators are programmed from the basic actuator through the water-shaping method, which exhibits bending, unbending, twisting, and untwisting, respectively, under NIR light illumination. In addition, an S-shape actuator and a flower-shape actuator are programmed from the basic actuators through the water-welding method. By simply turning over the S-shape actuator, it can perform a bidirectional crawling motion. Finally, two intricate bionic light-driven actuators (tendril-shape and octopus-shape) are constructed, which are unattainable from conventional fabrication methods of actuators. We believe that this study will unlock a new way to programmable, self-healing, and light-driven soft robots with tunable and complex shape morphing.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactuators 3afilms (materials) 3agraphene oxide 3ahydrophilicity 3anear infrared radiation 3awelding 0aactuator 0acomplex morphing 0aprogrammable 0aself-healing1 aXiao, Yiwen1 aYao, Liqiang1 aZhang, Wei1 aZhou, Peidi1 aChen, Luzhuo1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4823-07480 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2020 Nov. 30, v. 12, no. 49 p.55125-55133dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.0c143803Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02733naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002200140245013500162300001600297520143300313592002801746650002201774650001101796650001001807650001801817650001101835650003601846650001501882650002401897650001601921650002201937650001201959650002801971650002301999651001102022700002002033700002602053700003202079773011702111856007402228852000902302655001202311IND60517875620221122225922.0160405e201605  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051787562DNAL7 a10.1111/ijcs.122532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLikoudis, Zisimos10aConsumers’ intention to buy protected designation of origin and protected geographical indication foodstuffs: the case of Greece  ap. 283-289.  aThere is evidence that consumers tend to highly regard the quality, authenticity, ethical standards, country of origin and sustainable production of foodstuffs; hence, the growing number of studies on products of Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) and Protected Geographical Indication (PGI). PDO and PGI labelling is associated with the preservation of local plant varieties, the financial reward of local people and the sustainable development of rural areas. This study was set out to investigate the factors associated with Greek consumers’ intention to buy PDO/PGI food products. A total of 615 consumers took part in the study from the municipality of Attica, Greece. The survey was conducted during the period of March 2011 to April 2013. Results indicated that approximately 50% of respondents were willing to buy PDO/PGI products whereas the willingness to buy these products constituted an important factor in purchasing them. More specifically, according to the regression analysis, factors that are significantly associated with respondents’ willingness to buy PDOs/PGIs were as follows: origin, health claims and label of a product, as well as sustainable consumer behaviour. Understanding the main factors relating to consumers’ purchasing intent towards PDO/PGI products is an important step towards promoting special labelled agri‐foodstuffs and hence contributes to the local sustainable development.  aPublisher supplied data 3aconsumer behavior 3aethics 3afoods 3ahealth claims 3apeople 3aprotected designation of origin 3apurchasing 3aregression analysis 3arural areas 3arural development 3asurveys 3asustainable development 3awillingness to pay 3aGreece1 aSdrali, Despina1 aCostarelli, Vassiliki1 aApostolopoulos, Constantine0 tInternational journal of consumer studies.g2016 May, v. 40, no. 3 p.283-289dBlackwell Sciencex1470-64237nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ijcs.122533Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03408naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002300148245010300171520191300274592002802187650001802215650001302233650002402246650001902270650003802289650002002327650003602347650001002383650001602393650001702409650003602426650001302462650002602475650001702501650001202518653001002530653001902540653001202559653003602571653001702607700002002624700001802644700002002662700001902682773012102701856008302822852000902905655001202914IND60773259520221119071301.0220719e202207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077325952DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cbpa.2022.1112112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTachibana, Tetsuya10aPoly I:C and R848 facilitate nitric oxide production via inducible nitric oxide synthase in chicks  aNitric oxide (NO) is a gaseous bioactive molecule associated with many physiological functions including vasodilation and neurotransmission. NO also plays an important role in immune responses during viral infections in mammals. However, there is a paucity of knowledge regarding the involvement of NO in viral infections in birds. Therefore, the purpose of the present study was to determine if intraperitoneal (IP) injection of poly I:C and R848 (resiquimod), which are analogues of virus component, affects NO production in chicks (Gallus gallus) as a bird model. The involvement of inducible NO synthase (iNOS) in poly I:C- and R848-induced anorexia and corticosterone release was also investigated. These virus analogues significantly increased plasma NO metabolites (NOx) concentrations. IP injection of poly I:C and R848 significantly increased iNOS mRNA expression in several organs including the liver. On the other hand, poly I:C and R848 significantly decreased mRNA expressions of endothelial NOS and neural NOS in several organs, indicating that induction of iNOS might be responsible for increased NOx levels in plasma. This finding was further confirmed by using a selective iNOS inhibitor, S-methylisothiourea sulfate (SMT), which abolished the poly I:C- and R848-induced increase in plasma NOx concentration. In addition, SMT partly attenuated the poly I:C- and R848-induced increase in plasma corticosterone concentration, suggesting that corticosterone release induced by these virus analogues may be partly mediated by iNOS. Collectively, the present results suggest that viral infections facilitate NO production by inducing iNOS. The liver would play an important role in the NO production because the response in iNOS mRNA expression to poly I:C and R848 was remarkable. The present results also suggest that NO is associated with corticosterone release in birds under viral infection.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGallus gallus 3aanorexia 3abioactive compounds 3acorticosterone 3aendothelial nitric oxide synthase 3agene expression 3ainducible nitric oxide synthase 3aliver 3ametabolites 3anitric oxide 3apolyinosinic-polycytidylic acid 3asulfates 3asynaptic transmission 3avasodilation 3aviruses 0aChick 0aCorticosterone 0aFeeding 0aInducible nitric oxide synthase 0aNitric oxide1 aTakahashi, Maki1 aKhan, Sakirul1 aMakino, Ryosuke1 aCline, Mark A.0 tComparative biochemistry and physiology.g2022 July, v. 269 p.111211-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12014x1095-64337nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cbpa.2022.1112113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03231naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002400148245007600172300001800248500001500266520171900281592002802000650001902028650003202047650001402079650001702093650001902110650001102129650002502140650001002165650001502175650003102190650002602221650001502247650000902262650003202271650001602303650002002319650002302339653001702362700002102379700001802400700002202418700002202440700001902462773011802481856008202599990002302681852000902704655001202713IND60091130820221119005303.0141103e20121215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009113082DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bmcl.2012.10.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBakmiwewa, Supun M.10aIdentification of selective inhibitors of indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 2  ap. 7641-7646.  a2019-12-06  aThe kynurenine pathway is responsible for the breakdown of the majority of the essential amino acid, tryptophan (Trp). The first and rate-limiting step of the kynurenine pathway can be independently catalysed by tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase (Tdo2), indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 (Ido1) or indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 2 (Ido2). Tdo2 or Ido1 enzymatic activity has been implicated in a number of actions of the kynurenine pathway, including immune evasion by tumors. IDO2 is expressed in several human pancreatic cancer cell lines, suggesting it also may play a role in tumorigenesis. Although Ido2 was originally suggested to be a target of the chemotherapeutic agent dextro-1-methyl-tryptophan, subsequent studies suggest this compound does not inhibit Ido2 activity. The development of selective Ido2 inhibitors could provide valuable tools for investigating its activity in tumor development and normal physiology. In this study, a library of Food and Drug Administration-approved drugs was screened for inhibition of mouse Ido2 enzymatic activity. A number of candidates were identified and IC₅₀ values of each compound for Ido1 and Ido2 were estimated. The Ido2 inhibitors were also tested for inhibition of Tdo2 activity. Our results showed that compounds from a class of drugs used to inhibit proton pumps were the most potent and selective Ido2 inhibitors identified in the library screen. These included tenatoprazole, which exhibited an IC₅₀ value of 1.8μM for Ido2 with no inhibition of Ido1 or Tdo2 activity detected at a concentration of 100μM tenatoprazole.

A recently reported 5-aminosalicylic acid-based prednisolone prodrug was shown to release the drug when incubated with the bacteria, while the para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA) based analogue did not. Instead, it showed a new HPLC peak with a relatively close retention time to the parent which was identified by LCMS as the partially reduced hydrazine product. This Letter investigates azoreduction across a panel of substrates with varying degrees of electronic and steric similarity to the PABA-based compound. Azo compounds with an electron donating group on the azo-containing aromatic ring showed immediate disproportionation to their parent amines without any detection of hydrazine intermediates by HPLC. Compounds containing only electron withdrawing groups are partially and reversibly reduced to produce a stable detectable hydrazine. They do not disproportionate to their parent amines, but regenerate the parent azo compound. This incomplete reduction is relevant to the design of azo-based prodrugs and the toxicology of azo-based dyes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aClostridium perfringens 3aamines 3aazo compounds 3abacteria 3achemistry 3acolon 3adrugs 3adyes 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3ahumans 3ahydrazine 3ametabolism 3aprednisolone 3atoxicology1 aRuiz, Juan F.

In U.S. waters, Winter Flounder are managed as three stocks: Gulf of Maine, southern New England–Mid-Atlantic Bight, and Georges Bank. Historically, it was believed that the spawning of inshore stocks occurs exclusively within natal estuaries. Based on the supposition of estuary-specific spawning, we hypothesized that Winter Flounder exhibit greater stock structure than predicted by the three-stock model and, in fact, that they exhibit genetic differentiation at the level of individual estuaries. We tested this hypothesis by conducting microsatellite DNA analysis at 12 loci and single-nucleotide polymorphism analysis at 4 loci on young-of-the year and adult Winter Flounder collected from 27 estuaries from Newfoundland to Delaware as well as from Georges Bank. We found highly significant coastwide genetic stock structure among Winter Flounder; however, there was little evidence of estuary-specific structure. Pooled collections from north and south of Cape Cod were genetically distinct, as were many individual collections compared between these two regions. However, there was little genetic heterogeneity among estuarine collections within either of these major geographic regions. The two Canadian collections from the Miramichi River and Newfoundland were genetically distinct from those in the Gulf of Maine. Our collection from Georges Bank was marginally distinct from the inshore collections from north and south of Cape Cod. Overall, our genetic results support the three-stock model used to manage Winter Flounder in U.S. waters and indicate the presence of at least two genetic stocks in Canadian waters (the Miramichi River in the Gulf of St. Lawrence and Passamaquoddy Bay in the Bay of Fundy). Furthermore, our data suggest that the spawning of Winter Flounder in nearshore coastal waters is more extensive than previously thought or that homing is weaker, contributing to the absence of genetic differentiation among populations from proximal estuaries.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aPseudopleuronectes americanus 3aadults 3acoastal water 3aestuaries 3aflounder 3agenetic heterogeneity 3aloci 3amicrosatellite repeats 3amodels 3anuclear genome 3arivers 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 3aspawning 3aDelaware 3aGulf of Maine 3aGulf of Saint Lawrence 3aMassachusetts1 aMaceda, Lorraine1 aGrunwald, Cheryl1 aRoy, Nirmal K.1 aWaldman, John R.0 tTransactions of the American Fisheries Society.g2014 Jan. 2, v. 143, no. 1 p.240-251dTaylor & FranciswJournal:19703x1548-86597nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00028487.2013.8478613Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02171naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245009200171300001600263520090900279592002801188650004301216650001301259650002101272650001801293650001601311650002301327650001101350650001601361650001301377650001601390650001301406653001301419653001301432653001801445653001101463653001701474700002601491700002201517773010401539856008501643852000901728655001201737IND60563083520221121042745.0170211e20170207xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056308352DNAL7 a10.1080/01904167.2016.12401912doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDehnavard, Sara10aTomato growth responses to foliar application of ammonium sulfate in hydroponic culture  ap. 315-323.  aThis study was done to evaluate the growth responses of tomato plants (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill.) to foliar application of ammonium sulfate in different concentrations of 0, 50, 100, or 200 mM once per week, as well as 50 mM in every other day under greenhouse and hydroponic culture system. The results showed that foliar application of ammonium restricted the plant height, yield, and vitamin C content of fruits, but it increased the chlorophyll content in treated plants. The highest and the lowest yield were obtained from zero (control) and 200 mM treated plants, respectively. Fruit hardness was not affected by treatments, while blossom end rot disorder was increased by higher concentrations of ammonium sulfate. In general, the result indicated that tomato plant is rather sensitive to foliar application of ammonium sulfate particularly to higher concentrations and application numbers.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSolanum lycopersicum var. lycopersicum 3aammonium 3aammonium sulfate 3aascorbic acid 3achlorophyll 3afoliar application 3afruits 3agreenhouses 3ahardness 3ahydroponics 3atomatoes 0aAmmonium 0anitrogen 0afruit quality 0agrowth 0afoliar spray1 aSouri, Mohammad Kazem1 aMardanlu, Sedighe0 tJournal of plant nutrition.g2017 Feb. 7, v. 40, no. 3 p.315-323dTaylor & Francisx1532-40877nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01904167.2016.12401913Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02183naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245008600168300001400254520079300268592002801061596005201089650001301141650002301154650001701177650004401194650002201238653004101260653002301301653001401324653002301338653002401361700001901385700002301404700001301427700001501440700001501455700001801470700002001488700001401508773012001522856008601642852000901728655001201737IND60595389920221117230236.0180618e20180102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059538992DNAL7 a10.1080/14786419.2017.13357242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSong, Yaling12aA new ferulic acid ester from Rhodiola wallichiana var. cholaensis (Crassulaceae)  ap. 77-84.  aA new ferulic acid ester, 6-feruloyloxyhexanoic acid (1), was isolated along with 10 known ones (2–11), from the concentrated water extract of Rhodiola wallichiana var. cholaensis.

However, the identification of novel targets for cell engineering is labor-intensive and has not yet been fully substantiated. Here, we established a CRISPR/Cas9 library screening platform in human embryonic kidney (HEK293) cells based on guide RNA integration mediated by recombinase-mediated cassette exchange (RMCE) to interrogate gene function in a high-throughput manner. This platform was further advanced using a nuclear localization signal-tagged recombinase that increased RMCE efficiency by 4.8-fold. Using this platform, we identified putative target genes, such as CDK8, GAS2L1, and GSPT1, and their perturbation confers resistance to hyperosmotic stress that inhibits cell growth and induces apoptosis. Knockout of these genes in monoclonal antibody (mAb)-producing recombinant HEK293 (rHEK293) cells enhanced resistance to hyperosmotic stress-induced apoptosis, resulting in enhanced mAb production. In particular, GSPT1-knockout yielded 2.3-fold increase in maximum mAb concentration in fed-batch culture where hyperosmotic stress naturally occurs due to nutrient feeding. Taken together, this streamlined screening platform allows the identification of novel targets associated with hyperosmotic stress, enabling the development of stress-resistant cells producing recombinant proteins.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCRISPR-Cas systems 3aRNA 3aapoptosis 3acell growth 3agenes 3ahumans 3akidneys 3amonoclonal antibodies 3aprotein synthesis 3arecombinant proteins 3arecombinases 3atherapeutics 0aHuman cell engineering 0aCRISPR/Cas9 library screening 0aRecombinase-mediated cassette exchange 0aTherapeutic proteins 0aOsmotic stress 0aApoptosis1 aKim, Su Hyun1 aPak, Chong-ho,1 aLee, Jae-seong,1 aLee, Gyun Min1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9876-73780 tMetabolic engineering.g2022 July, v. 72 p.247-258dElsevier Inc.aInternational Metabolic Engineering SocietywJournal:12015x1096-71767nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ymben.2022.03.0173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03649naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001700094024002100111024003900132024001100171040001800182100001800200245014800218300001400366506017300380520191800553650001502471650002202486650002102508650001302529650001702542650001602559650001802575650002402593700001702617700002202634700001602656700002602672700001502698700001502713700002302728700001802751773009702769856011202866856008502978956008603063961000903149852000903158655001203167IND60005953820221214231425.0140828e201407  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6000595382DNAL7 a2904462aris7 a10113/595382hdl7 a10.1016/j.envsoft.2014.02.0132doi8 ans5287  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHarmel, R.

Such guidance is needed to more effectively evaluate and interpret model performance and more accurately communicate that performance to decision-makers and other modeling stakeholders. Thus, we formulated a methodology for evaluation, interpretation, and communication of H/WQ model results. The recommended methodology focuses on interpretation and communication of results, not on model development or initial calibration and validation, and as such it applies to the modeling process following initial calibration. The methodology recommends the following steps: 1) evaluate initial model performance; 2) evaluate outliers and extremes in observed values and bias in predicted values; 3) estimate uncertainty in observed data and predicted values; 4) reevaluate model performance considering accuracy, precision, and hypothesis testing; 5) interpret model results considering intended use; and 6) communicate model performance. A flowchart and tables were developed to guide model interpretation, refinement, and proper application considering intended model uses (i.e., Exploratory, Planning, and Regulatory/Legal). The methodology was designed to enhance application of H/WQ models through conscientious evaluation, interpretation, and communication of model performance to decision-makers and other stakeholders; it is not meant to be a definitive standard or a required protocol, but together with recent recommendations and published best practices serve as guidelines for enhanced model application emphasizing the importance of the model’s intended use. 3aguidelines 3ahydrologic models 3amodel validation 3aplanning 3astakeholders 3auncertainty 3awater quality 3awatershed hydrology1 aSmith, P.

Parametric accelerated failure time models based on the log-normal distribution were used to identify and quantify the effect of factors influencing the time it took for cows to conceive after the Planned Start of Mating (PSM) date. A focus of this study was to quantify the effect of liveweight change in the first 4weeks after calving (ΔLWPP) and liveweight change in the period from PSM—21days to PSM (ΔLWBPSM) on PSM to conception intervals. Parity, calving to PSM interval, ΔLWBPSM, milk protein percentage, breed, clinical mastitis, the presence of a fertility treatment and season was associated with PSM to conception intervals. PSM to conception intervals for cows with zero or positive ΔLWBPSM was 74% of those for cows with negative ΔLWBPSM (TR 0.74, 95% CI 0.48 to 1.00; P=0.05). The findings of this study are consistent with those reported in the literature and better define the impact of long- and short-term liveweight changes on reproductive performance, providing the opportunity to design feeding programmes to minimise the impact of LW loss (used as a proxy for negative energy balance) on reproductive failure in pasture fed dairy herds.  aPublisher supplied data 3abody weight 3acalving 3acohort studies 3aconception 3adairy cows 3adairy herds 3aenergy balance 3amastitis 3amilk protein percentage 3apastures 3areproductive performance 3aNew Zealand1 aStevenson, M.A.1 aWilliamson, N.B.1 aLopez-Villalobos, N.1 aOtley, T.0 tLivestock science.g2012 May, v. 145, no. 1-3 p.131-139dElsevier B.V.x1871-14137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.livsci.2011.12.0253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03225naa a2200649 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245012300167300001600290520145000306592002801756650001201784650002301796650001201819650001301831650001801844650001001862650001001872650001201882650001101894650001101905650002601916650001401942650002001956650001801976650001401994650000902008650001402017650001202031650001102043650001402054650001402068650001302082650002802095650001402123650002302137650001502160650001402175650001202189650001502201650001902216650001102235650001102246650000902257653002302266653002502289653003002314700002102344773010402365856008502469852000902554655001202563IND60563083820221121042805.0170211e20170207xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056308382DNAL7 a10.1080/01904167.2016.12401942doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMoreira, A.10aYield, nutritional status and soil fertility cultivated with common bean in response to amino-acids foliar application  ap. 344-351.  aFertilization of common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris) plants with amino-acids (AAs) near the beginning of flowering may increase productivity. This procedure is aimed to avoid waste and increase nutrient use efficiency at the end of the crop cycle, improving the leaf area in the translocation of these nutrients to the common bean. In order to test this hypothesis, a field experiment was conducted on a typic Eutrortox (Oxisol) in randomized block design, with three replicates. Four rates of a solution composed of amino-acids (6.8% glycine, 4.4% proline, 3.3% glutamic acid, 2.7% alanine, 1.9% arginine, 1.7% aspartic acid, 1.3% lysine, 1.3% histidine, and 1.0% leucine) applied 45 days after plant emergence were studied. There was no interaction between years of cultivation × amino-acids. However, the productivity of common bean was significantly influenced by the AAs rates, with the highest seed yield obtained at estimated concentration in 0.0094% of the product in foliar sprays. The increases in the rates resulted in increased foliar nitrogen (N) and zinc (Zn) concentrations and decreased sulfur (S) concentration. The macronutrient uptake was nitrogen>potassium>phosphorus>magnesium > calcium > sulfur (N > K > P > Mg > Ca > S), while for micronutrients it was iron>zinc>boron>copper>manganese (Fe > Zn > B > Cu > Mn). In the soil, the concentrations of organic carbon (C) and available P were negatively affected by the AAs rates.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOxisols 3aPhaseolus vulgaris 3aalanine 3aarginine 3aaspartic acid 3abeans 3aboron 3acalcium 3acarbon 3acopper 3afield experimentation 3aflowering 3afoliar spraying 3aglutamic acid 3ahistidine 3airon 3aleaf area 3aleucine 3alysine 3amagnesium 3amanganese 3anitrogen 3anutrient use efficiency 3anutrients 3anutritional status 3aphosphorus 3apotassium 3aproline 3aseed yield 3asoil fertility 3asulfur 3awastes 3azinc 0aPhaseolus vulgaris 0afoliar fertilization 0aamino-acid use efficiency1 aMoraes, L.

This study sought to verify whether extra-virgin olive oil (EVOO), lipophilic fraction (OOLF) and hydrophilic fraction (OOHF) exerted a brain protective effect against the oxidative stress caused by 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) pesticide at a dose of 5 mg/kg body weight. 2,4-D, EVOO and its fractions were administered to rats by gavages for four consecutive weeks. Oxidative stress was assessed by measuring brain lipid peroxide level, acetylcholinesterase (AChE), antioxidant enzyme activities and fatty acid composition. 2,4-D induced a decrease in both plasma and brain acetylcholinesterase activity and a rise in Brain TBARS (Thiobarbituric acid reactive substances) level and antioxidant enzyme activities compared with the control group. These changes were partly reversed by either EVOO or its fractions oral administration to 2,4-D treated rats. EVOO enhanced a neuroprotective effect evaluated by the restoration of brain fatty acid composition especially the level of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). Our results indicate that EVOO exerts a neuroprotective activity against oxidative damage in brain induced by 2,4-D, which could be attributed to its antioxidative property.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3a2,4-D 3aAlzheimer disease 3aParkinson disease 3aacetylcholinesterase 3aantioxidant activity 3abody weight 3abrain 3abrain damage 3acardiovascular diseases 3adocosahexaenoic acid 3aenzyme activity 3aextra-virgin olive oil 3afatty acid composition 3ahydrophilicity 3aneuroprotective effect 3aoral administration 3aoxidative stress 3arats 3athiobarbituric acid-reactive substances1 aWafa, Tayeb1 aSamia, Dabbou1 aYousra, Belaid1 aIssam, Chargui1 aCheraif, Imed1 aAttia, Nebil1 aMohamed, Hammami0 tJournal of food science and technology.g2016 Mar., v. 53, no. 3 p.1454-1464dSpringer IndiawJournal:jnl16929x0022-11557nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13197-015-2150-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02999naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245017700169500002200346506010400368506007600472520131500548592002801863506003701891650001501928650002001943650001001963650002901973650002002002650001602022650001302038650001502051650002302066653001802089653001302107653002002120653001302140653001002153700002002163700002002183700002702203700002102230700002202251700001702273700002902290773011702319856004802436852000902484655001202493IND60795614720221207133945.0221004e20220921xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079561472DNAL7 a10.1016/j.eti.2022.1029252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlsalhi, Abdullah10aTheoretical investigations on the liquid-phase molecular separation in isolation and purification of pharmaceutical molecules from aqueous solutions via polymeric membranes  aPre-press version  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aWe have developed ANFIS (adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system) modeling strategy for investigations on molecular separation using membrane systems. The results can be useful for purification and isolation of pharmaceutical molecules during manufacturing, and also for purification of water effluents. The developed methodology is based on combination of machine learning model which is ANFIS in this case and also computational fluid dynamics (CFD). The integration between two models is built through prediction of drug concentration in the system via both method in which the CFD results are considered as inputs to the ANFIS model. In order to analyze the existing data set, which has 2 inputs r and z and one output C, we used the optimized ANFIS model. A total of over 8 thousand data rows are included in this data set which are produced using the CFD simulation of membrane separation. The ANFIS model has been optimized using three population-based methods, namely Genetic Algorithm (GA), Firefly Algorithm (FA), and Bat Algorithm (BA), in order to achieve desired results. The optimization of hyper-parameters with all three techniques has had significant results and all have shown an R² score higher than 0.99. In terms of MSE, the error rate decreased to 3.907 and the RMSE optimized to 1.02E+01.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aalgorithms 3adata collection 3adrugs 3aenvironmental technology 3afluid mechanics 3afuzzy logic 3apolymers 3aprediction 3awater purification 0aPharmaceutics 0aModeling 0aDrug separation 0aMembrane 0aANFIS1 aHuwaimel, Bader1 aAlobaida, Ahmed1 aAlzahrani, Mohammad S.1 aAlshehri, Sameer1 aVenkatesan, Kumar1 aKotb, Hossam1 aAbourehab, Mohammed A.S.0 tEnvironmental technology & innovation.g2022 Sept. 21,  p.102925-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23259x2352-18647nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.eti.2022.102925  aDNAL 7aarticle03231naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245012700168300001600295520193500311592002802246650002502274650001102299650001102310650002302321650001102344650001302355650001402368650001502382650001202397650001202409650001702421650000902438651001102447700002202458700002202480700002102502700001802523700002302541773014002564856008402704852000902788655001202797IND60123498220221118074701.0150325e20140304xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012349822DNAL7 a10.1080/00028487.2013.8526232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJones, Kim K.10aEffectiveness of Instream Wood Treatments to Restore Stream Complexity and Winter Rearing Habitat for Juvenile Coho Salmon  ap. 334-345.  aLarge wood and boulder placement projects have become common in the Pacific Northwest to restore complex stream habitat for juvenile Coho Salmon Oncorhynchus kisutch and other salmonids. We evaluated habitat responses at 91 large wood restoration projects in western Oregon from pretreatment to 1 year and 6 years after treatment. Large logs were arranged in jams without cabling or burial in the bottom or banks of the stream. Projects commonly treated 0.5–1 km of stream, but some extended up to 2.3 km. Significant changes in the amounts of large wood, complex pools, and predicted Coho Salmon rearing capacity were observed within 1 year of treatment. Six years after treatment, the amount of large wood, complex pools, and Coho Salmon rearing capacity remained significantly higher than pretreatment levels by 100, 800, and 32%, respectively, and the surface area of pools and gravel increased significantly over pretreatment levels by 15% and 8%, respectively. However, the amount of large wood decreased in a majority of projects during the 6 years after treatment reflecting net export out of the sites and a lack of recruitment from upstream or local sources. Site-specific responses in stream habitat were positive overall, but variability among sites suggested independent behavior. Responses of the restoration projects were weakly related to channel size, local lithology, or landscape cover, although retention of large wood was associated with lower gradient and coniferous forest cover. Despite the variability in project behavior, the findings indicate that large wood projects may play a role in maintaining and improving stream complexity and Coho Salmon rearing capacity in coast basins of Oregon, potentially compensating for the lack of natural recruitment of wood to the streams. Attention to location within the stream network and treatment details may improve performance of the restoration actions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOncorhynchus kisutch 3abasins 3acoasts 3aconiferous forests 3agravel 3ahabitats 3ajuveniles 3alandscapes 3arearing 3astreams 3asurface area 3awood 3aOregon1 aAnlauf-Dunn, Kara1 aJacobsen, Paul S.1 aStrickland, Matt1 aTennant, Lora1 aTippery, Sharon E.0 tTransactions of the American Fisheries Society.g2014 Mar. 4, v. 143, no. 2 p.334-345dTaylor & FranciswJournal:19703x1548-86597nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00028487.2013.8526233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02061naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245014900165300001800314500001500332520074900347592002801096650002201124650001701146650001701163650002801180650003701208650001601245650003901261653001701300700001601317700001701333700001601350700002001366700001701386700001601403773011801419856008201537990002301619852000901642655001201651IND60091131620221119004117.0141103e20121215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009113162DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bmcl.2012.09.1052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLu, Chuanjun10aDesign, synthesis, and evaluation of resveratrol derivatives as Aß₁–₄₂ aggregation inhibitors, antioxidants, and neuroprotective agents  ap. 7683-7687.  a2019-12-06  aA series of novel resveratrol derivatives were designed, synthesised and evaluated as potential therapeutic agents for the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease.

This article explores evidence-based treatment recommendations for patients with metabolic syndrome who are also positive for HIV. Patients infected with HIV may manifest metabolic abnormalities. They often present with low high-density lipoprotein (HDL-C), hypertension, visceral adiposity, and insulin resistance, among other symptoms consistent with features of the metabolic syndrome. The etiologies of the metabolic abnormalities are not completely understood. The role of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) and the separate effect of HIV on patients who are surviving longer may contribute to the increased incidence of the development of the metabolic syndrome. The role of the health care team is to provide patient education to patients with HIV concerning lifestyle modification in order to prevent complications related to the metabolic syndrome.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHuman immunodeficiency virus 3aadiposity 3adiabetes 3adrug therapy 3ahealth care workers 3ahigh density lipoprotein 3ahypertension 3ainsulin resistance 3alifestyle 3ametabolic syndrome 3apatient education 3apatients 2aAntiretroviral Therapy, Highly Active 2aCD4 Lymphocyte Count 2aExercise 2aFemale 2aHIV Infectionsxcomplicationsxdrug therapyximmunologyxpsychology. 2aGlycated Hemoglobinxmetabolism. 2aHumans 2aMale 2aMetabolic Syndromexcomplicationsxpsychologyxrehabilitationxtherapy. 2aMiddle Aged 2aRisk Factors 2aTumor Necrosis Factor-alphaxphysiology1 aLongstaff, Laura0 tDiabetes educator.g2010 May, v. 36, no. 3 p.457-464dSAGE PublicationswJournal:jnl42983x1554-60637nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1177/01457217103636193Available from publisher's site 7aarticle02509naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245011200163500002200275506010400297506007600401520087200477592002801349506003701377650001401414650002701428650002001455650002301475650001901498650002901517650001001546650001401556650002201570650001501592650001601607650001501623653003201638653001601670653002601686653004101712653001401753700001601767700001601783700001401799700001601813773011701829856004801946852000901994655001202003IND60795614920221207133948.0221004e20220926xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079561492DNAL7 a10.1016/j.eti.2022.1029282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhu, Pengyu10aPreparing Co-Pi/BiVO[formula omitted] for effective degradation of sulfur-containing organics in wastewater  aPre-press version  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aTo effectively degrade sulfur-containing organics in wastewater, a stable and excellent composite catalyst CoOₓ/BiVO₄ (Co-Pi/BiVO ₄) was prepared by electrodeposition in phosphate neutral buffer solution. With the optimized Co(NO₃)₂:BiVO₄ of 1:3, the COD removal and desulfurization of the wastewater under visible light reached 80% and >78%, respectively. These values were higher than those achieved with CoOₓ/BiVO₄ and BiVO₄ in visible light. At the same time, the morphology, crystal form, chemical state, oxygen evolution, and electrical impedance of Co-Pi/BiVO ₄ are tested and compared with related substances. It is concluded that Co-Pi/BiVO₄ has a strong oxidation and stability. Finally, the kinetic and degradation mechanisms of related catalysts are deeply analyzed, and the protonation pathways of hydroxyl radicals are constructed.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acatalysts 3achemical oxygen demand 3adesulfurization 3aelectric impedance 3aelectroplating 3aenvironmental technology 3alight 3aoxidation 3aoxygen production 3aphosphates 3aprotonation 3awastewater 0aPhosphate-buffered solution 0aCo-Pi/BiVO4 0aEffective degradation 0aSulfur-containing organic wastewater 0aMechanism1 aSun, Xiuyun1 aZhu, Kaijin1 aWang, Jie1 aBai, Junwei0 tEnvironmental technology & innovation.g2022 Sept. 26,  p.102928-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23259x2352-18647nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.eti.2022.102928  aDNAL 7aarticle02525naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001400150245007200164300001600236520158300252592002801835650001601863650001001879650001301889700001601902700001501918700002301933700002301956700002001979773011901999856008402118852000902202655001202211IND60090110120221122002258.0141102e201103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009011012DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbapap.2010.12.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAn, Xiuli10aInter-subunit interactions in erythroid and non-erythroid spectrins  ap. 420-427.  aSpectrins comprise α- and β-subunits made up predominantly of a series of homologous repeating units of about 106 amino acids; the α- and β-chains form antiparallel dimers by lateral association, and tetramers through head-to-head contacts between the dimers. Here we consider the first of these interactions. (1) We confirm earlier observations, showing that the first two paired repeats (βIR1 with αIR21, and βIR2 with αRI20) at one end of the erythroid spectrin (αIβI) dimer are necessary and sufficient to unite the chains; (2) we resolve a conflict in published reports by showing that the strength of the interaction is considerably increased on adding the adjoining pair of repeats (βIR3–αIR19); (3) in brain (αIIβII) spectrin the first two pairs of repeats are similarly essential and sufficient for heterodimer formation; (4) this interaction is ~60-fold stronger than that in the erythroid counterpart, but no enhancement can be detected on addition of three further pairs of repeats; (5) formation of a tight αIβI dimer probably depends on structural coupling of the first two repeats in each chain; (6) an analysis of the sequences of the strongly interacting repeats, βIR1, βIIR1, αIR21 and αIIR20 and repeats in α-actinin, which also interact very strongly in forming an antiparallel dimer, affords a possible explanation for the different properties of the two spectrin isoforms in respect of the stability of the inter-chain interactions, and also suggests the evolutionary path by which the erythroid and non-erythroid sequences diverged.  aPublisher supplied data 3aamino acids 3abrain 3aspectrin1 aGuo, Xinhua1 aYang, Yang1 aGratzer, Walter B.1 aBaines, Anthony J.1 aMohandas, Narla0 tBiochimica et biophysica acta.g2011 Mar., v. 1814, no. 3 p.420-427dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12097x1878-14547nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbapap.2010.12.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01723naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245011100166300001800277520053200295592002800827650002100855650002700876650002600903650000900929650002900938650001300967650002200980650001001002650002101012700001301033700002001046700002001066700001901086773011801105856008201223990002301305852000901328655001201337IND60091131820221119003903.0141103e20121215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009113182DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bmcl.2012.09.1062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQi, Qing-Rong10aSynthesis and antibacterial activity of new fluoroquinolones containing a cis- or trans-cyclohexane moiety  ap. 7688-7692.  aNew quinolone derivatives bearing a cis- or trans-cyclohexane side chain at the C-7 position have been synthesized and evaluated for their antibacterial activities against Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa using the agar dilution method.

In the field, methyl bromide fumigant was applied in a split-plot design in order to provide pathogen-free reference treatments. None of the following herbicides increased susceptibility to common root rot: atrazine [2-chloro-4-(ethylamino)-6-(isopropylamino)-s-triazine], cyanazine {2-[4-chloro-6-(ethylamino)- s-triazin-2-yl]amino-2-methylpropionitrile}, dalapon (2, 2- dichloropropionic acid), dinoseb (2-sec butyl-4, 6-dinitrophenol), EPTC (S-ethyl dipropylthiocarbamate), MCPB {4-[(4-chloro-o-toly)oxy]butyric acid}, propachlor (2- chloro-N-isopropylacetanilide). However, trifluralin (α, α,α-trifuoro-2, 6-dinitro-N,N-dipropyl-p-toluidine) appeared to reduce the disease injury. When peas were planted in pathogen infested soil in 1973, trifluralin at 0.56 kg/ha followed by 5.6 kg/ha of propachlor increased shelled pea yields 29% above that of controls. Higher trifluralin rates did not improve yields, but did reduce root rot symptoms. Methyl bromide fumigation increased pea stands, but reduced yield of shelled peas. In the greenhouse trifluralin at rates of 1.12 kg/ha or more, resulted in nearly complete prevention of root rot in peas. The 0.56 kg/ha rate provided partial control. In culture, trifluralin at 10 mg or more per liter of medium, reduced mycelial growth and zoospore production of Aphanomyces euteiches, but had no effect on the fungus at rates similar to those used in the field applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAphanomyces euteiches 3aEPTC (herbicide) 3aPisum sativum 3aatrazine 3abutyric acid 3acyanazine 3adalapon 3adinoseb 3aexperimental design 3afumigants 3afumigation 3afungi 3agreenhouses 3amethyl bromide 3amycelium 3apathogens 3apeas 3apropachlor 3aroot rot 3asoil 3atrifluralin 3azoospores1 aHagedorn, D.

The objectives of this study were to determine in a perennial crop species whether there is a relationship between the CM readings, N leaf concentration, and N use efficiency (NUE) and to use CM readings as a diagnostic tool for predicting dry matter yield in response to N fertilization. The CM readings varied across environments, growth stages, and fertilization treatments and were correlated with NUE. NUE was also affected by the environment, N fertilization, and interactions among these variables. This study provides new information about the effect of N application on CM readings, N leaf concentration, and NUE in a perennial crop such as oregano.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOriganum vulgare 3achlorophyll 3acrops 3adevelopmental stages 3adiagnostic techniques 3adry matter accumulation 3afertilizer application 3aleaves 3amedicinal plants 3anitrogen 3anitrogen fertilizers 3anutrient use efficiency 3anutrition 3aoregano 3aprediction 0aAromatic and medicinal plants 0adry matter yield 0agrowth stages 0anitrogen uptake efficiency 0anitrogen utilization efficiency0 tJournal of plant nutrition.g2017 Feb. 7, v. 40, no. 3 p.391-403dTaylor & Francisx1532-40877nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01904167.2016.12402003Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01765naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001500147245010800162300001800270520068400288592002800972650001301000650001401013650001101027650001101038650001601049650001901065650003701084700001601121700001601137700001801153700001801171700001901189773010501208856008101313852000901394655001201403IND60119723520221123022901.0141227e201502  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011972352DNAL7 a10.1007/s10853-014-8725-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Canhui10aInterface-level thermodynamic stability diagram for in situ internal oxidation of Ag(SnO2) p composites  ap. 1646-1654.  aWe present a combined experimental and theoretical study on interfacial structure and thermodynamics in internally oxidized Ag(SnO₂)ₚcomposites.

Methods This was a descriptive cross-sectional study using paper-and-pencil surveys by mail. Adults with type 2 diabetes and a family history of diabetes attending a self-management education program in the Metropolitan New York/ New Jersey area were recruited. Measures were completed about risk perception and fear of amputation, emotional representations of diabetes from the Illness Perception Questionnaire, and the foot self-care behavior component of the Summary of Diabetes Self-care Activities Survey. The authors estimated the variability in foot self-care that was accounted for by risk perception and fearful memories. Results In those who remembered a family member needing an amputation, high perceived risk and fear was associated with less routine foot self-care. For those without family history of amputation, fear was positively associated with foot self-care. Conclusions Motivation for foot self-care behavior may be driven by risk perception and emotional responses. The ways in which risk perception and fear influence motivation for preventive foot self-care behavior are influenced by whether one’s family member was affected by an amputation. Probing about the influence of the patient’s legacy of diabetes may be helpful when customizing education plans.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadults 3aamputation 3across-sectional studies 3aeducation 3aemotions 3afearfulness 3amotivation 3anoninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 3apatients 3aquestionnaires 3arisk perception 3asurveys 2aAdult 2aAmputation, Surgicalxpsychology. 2aRacial Groups. 2aCross-Sectional Studies 2aDiabetes Mellitus, Type 2xcomplications 2aDiabetic Footxepidemiologyxrehabilitationxsurgery. 2aEmotions 2aFear 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aMale 2aPerception 2aSurveys and Questionnaires. 2aRisk Factors 2aSelf Care 3aNew Jersey 3aNew York1 aWalker, Elizabeth A.1 aBleich, David0 tDiabetes educator.g2010 May, v. 36, no. 3 p.473-482dSAGE PublicationswJournal:jnl42983x1554-60637nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1177/01457217103621083Available from publisher's site 7aarticle03420naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245013700170300001600307520225500323592002802578650001802606650002102624650001602645650002502661650001702686650001202703650002002715650001002735650001202745650001702757650001602774650001102790651001202801773014002813856008402953852000903037655001203046IND60123498620221118074734.0150325e20140304xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012349862DNAL7 a10.1080/00028487.2013.8600472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPoesch, Mark S.10aDeveloping Standardized Methods for Sampling Freshwater Fishes with Multiple Gears: Effects of Sampling Order versus Sampling Method  ap. 353-362.  aDeveloping robust methodologies for sampling freshwater fishes is important for the assessment and recovery of aquatic biodiversity. Commonly, sampling protocols recommend the use of both electrofishing and seining to reduce bias when sampling freshwater fishes. The objective of this study was to determine whether sampling method, sampling order, or the combination of these influenced the assessment of diversity and abundance of common or rare freshwater fishes at both the species and assemblage level. Fifty sites were sampled in the Sydenham River, Ontario, Canada, where paired sites were sampled using both electrofishing and seine netting in close proximity but also reversing the initial sampling order. Differences in the abundance and richness of common and rare freshwater fishes were tested with two-way ANOVA and multivariate ANOVA. Multivariate differences in the representation of species assemblages were compared using Procrustes analysis across ordinations built using differences in sampling method and sampling order. Electrofishing outperformed seine netting for maximizing the abundance of both all species caught (P = 0.004) and only those species considered rare (P = 0.049). While capture efficiencies generally decreased with subsequent sampling, the interaction between sampling method and sampling order for maximizing richness estimates of rare species was significant (P = 0.049). There were important species and assemblage differences when sampling order was reversed. The representation of either sunfishes (family Centrarchidae) or catfishes (family Ictaluridae) differed in multivariate space, given different sampling order. In addition, the capture of Blackstripe Topminnow Fundulus notatus was enhanced when seine netting was used after electrofishing. This study highlights the often neglected aspect of choosing an appropriate sampling order when developing protocols for sampling freshwater fishes with multiple methods. Overall, the combination of electrofishing, followed by seine netting, appears to maximize capture efficiencies of both common and rare fishes; however, researchers should be aware that sampling order can alter the representation of species and assemblages in multivariate assessments.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCentrarchidae 3aFundulus notatus 3aIctaluridae 3aanalysis of variance 3abiodiversity 3acatfish 3afreshwater fish 3agears 3anetting 3arare species 3aresearchers 3arivers 3aOntario0 tTransactions of the American Fisheries Society.g2014 Mar. 4, v. 143, no. 2 p.353-362dTaylor & FranciswJournal:19703x1548-86597nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00028487.2013.8600473Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02946naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001900146245011600165520140800281592002801689650001601717650001601733650001201749650001401761650002201775650001401797650002301811650001801834650001601852650001201868650001401880650001301894650001501907650003201922650001301954650002101967650003101988653000902019653002202028653001202050653002002062653000902082700001802091700001202109700001502121700001402136700002002150700001402170700001702184773010102201856008102302852000902383655001202392IND60766065820221121194234.0220816e202206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076606582DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fm.2022.1039962doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWen, Xiangyuan10aDynamic changes of bacteria and screening of potential spoilage markers of lamb in aerobic and vacuum packaging  aMicroorganisms proliferate, consume nutrients, and produce many undesired metabolites, which are the main reason for the spoilage of fresh meat. Screening spoilage markers is of great significance for characterizing the freshness of fresh meat. At present, there are few studies on the volatile spoilage markers (VSMs) of lamb and their relationship with bacteria. In this study, the spoilage evolution of lamb was evaluated by multiple indicators. The changes of bacteria and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in aerobic-packaged (AP) and vacuum-packaged (VP) lamb were measured by 16S next-generation sequencing (NGS) and headspace solid-phase microextraction (HS-SPME)-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) respectively. The potential VSMs were also screened. Results showed that the shelf life of AP lamb at 4 °C was less than 10 d and VP lamb was less than 28 d. Pseudomonas was the dominant bacteria in AP lamb, while Latilactobacillus and Lactococcus were the dominant bacteria in VP lamb. Several VOCs could be recommended as potential spoilage markers, including 1-octen-3-ol, 1-hexanol, nonanal, methoxy-phenyloxime, 2,3-octanedione, acetoin and 1-pentanol for AP lamb; acetoin, 1-hexanol, 2,3-octanedione, hexanoic acid, 1-octen-3-ol, nonanal, hexanal and 2,3-octanediol for VP lamb. This study can provide information for characterizing and predicting the freshness of fresh lamb.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLactococcus 3aPseudomonas 3aacetoin 3aevolution 3afood microbiology 3afreshness 3aheadspace analysis 3ahexanoic acid 3ametabolites 3aoctenol 3apentanols 3araw meat 3ashelf life 3asolid phase microextraction 3aspoilage 3avacuum packaging 3avolatile organic compounds 0aLamb 0aDominant bacteria 0a16S NGS 0aHSPME–GC–MS 0aVOCs1 aZhang, Dequan1 aLi, Xin1 aDing, Ting1 aLiang, Ce1 aZheng, Xiaochun1 aYang, Wei1 aHou, Chengli0 tFood microbiology.g2022 June, v. 104 p.103996-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl34976x0740-00207nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fm.2022.1039963Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01731naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245007700159300001600236520084600252592002801098650001101126650001701137650002101154650001301175650001801188650002201206651001201228773010601240856007401346852000901420655001201429IND60517876820221120211920.0160405e201604  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051787682DNAL7 a10.1111/joac.120942doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aClark, Patrick10aCan the State Foster Food Sovereignty?

It presents a theoretical framework and literature review focused on the question of food sovereignty, the state and agrarian political economy. The case study of Ecuador, one of a handful of countries that has attempted to institutionalize food sovereignty in state policy, examines the political processes that led to the institutionalization of food sovereignty and the rural development and agricultural policies of the ‘post‐neoliberal’ government of Rafael Correa. The analysis of the Ecuadorian case concludes that the implementation of public policies reflecting food sovereignty principles has largely proven elusive, with the exception of some institutional changes and developments at the local levels of the state.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCorrea 3acase studies 3afood sovereignty 3apolitics 3apublic policy 3arural development 3aEcuador0 tJournal of agrarian change.g2016 Apr., v. 16, no. 2 p.183-205dBlackwell Publishersx1471-03587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/joac.120943Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02346naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245009900168300001800267520116500285592002801450650002301478650001501501650001201516650002201528650001801550650001801568650001201586650003801598700001601636700001701652700001801669700002201687700002801709700002801737773010501765856008101870852000901951655001201960IND60119723720221123023008.0141227e201502  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011972372DNAL7 a10.1007/s10853-014-8727-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVendamani, V.

Porous silicon is considered as a target material for ablation because it contains a large number of light emitting silicon nanoparticles. The pSi samples were prepared by anodic etching of silicon in aqueous HF solution for different etching current densities. Transmission electron microscope measurements confirmed the successful formation of well-isolated spherical silicon nanoparticles. The average size of spherical NPs were estimated to be ~7.6, ~7, and ~6 nm when anodic etching current densities of 5, 10, and 20 mA/cm²were used respectively for preparing pSi targets. The crystallinity of these Si NPs was confirmed by selective area electron diffraction and Raman spectroscopy measurements. The observed blue shift in the absorption and emission spectra are attributed to reduction in the average particle size with increase in etching current density. These Si NPs may be useful for fabricating low-dimensional microelectronic compatible photonic devices.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRaman spectroscopy 3aabsorption 3aacetone 3acrystal structure 3ananoparticles 3aparticle size 3asilicon 3atransmission electron microscopes1 aHamad, Syed1 aSaikiran, V.1 aPathak, A.

They bind water, contribute to the formation of viscous dough and improve the quality of bread. For the application of AX fractions in bread making process, it is useful to record a quality profile of wheat fractions compared to the quality profile of rye fractions under standardized conditions. In this work water and alkali extractable AX containing fractions, from wheat- and rye wholemeal, were extracted under standardized conditions and characterized. For analysis of composition, structural features, and molecular dimension a combination of chemical, physicochemical, enzymatic and chromatographic techniques was applied. The molar mass distributions obtained by means of an innovative colorimetric pentose detection in the eluted SEC fractions were comparable for all under standardized conditions extracted AXs. The determined molar masses of AXs extracted both from wheat- and from rye grain were close to 2.0 × 10⁵ g/mol for water extractable AXs and 3.0 × 10⁵ g/mol for alkali extractable AXs. Different susceptibility to endoxylanase treatment, having been observed as differences in the SEC profiles, may be evidence of structural differences between AXs depending on their origin. The viscosities of AX solutions were strongly influenced by their molar mass and structure; samples being less susceptible to endoxylanase provided solutions of higher viscosity.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aarabinoxylan 3abreadmaking 3abreadmaking quality 3achromatography 3acolorimetry 3adough 3aendo-1,4-beta-xylanase 3amolecular weight 3apentoses 3arye 3aviscosity 3awheat1 aPraznik, Werner1 aLoeppert, Renate1 aNowotna, Anna0 tJournal of food science and technology.g2016 Mar., v. 53, no. 3 p.1389-1398dSpringer IndiawJournal:jnl16929x0022-11557nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13197-015-2135-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02265naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002600144245007300170520116200243592002801405650002801433650002601461650001101487650001201498650001301510650001201523653002601535653002501561653002701586653002601613653002701639653002001666700002701686773010301713856007801816852000901894655001201903IND60573144920221123044359.0170721e20170407xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057314492DNAL7 a10.1515/ijfe-2016-00042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShirmohammadi, Maryam10aFinite Element modeling of Mechanical Loading-Pumpkin Peel and flesh  aFinite element (FE) models of uniaxial loading of pumpkin peel and flesh tissues were developed and validated using experimental results. The tensile model was developed for both linear elastic and plastic material models, the compression model was developed only with the plastic material model. The outcomes of force versus time curves obtained from FE models followed similar pattern to the experimental curves; however the curve resulted with linear elastic material properties had a higher difference with the experimental curves. The values of predicted forces were determined and compared with the experimental curve. An error indicator was introduced and computed for each case and compared. Additionally, Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) values were also calculated for each model and compared. The results of modeling were used to develop material model for peel and flesh tissues in FE modeling of mechanical peeling of tough skin vegetables.

Adjusting the sowing dates has been considered an effective measure to adapt to climate change, but there was little evidence that how well the producers had done. In this study, we used phenology observations at 67 stations from 1981 to 2014 to detect trends in actual sowing dates, then the agricultural production systems simulator, APSIM-Maize model, was used to assess the effects of changes in observed sowing dates on maize phenology and yields. During the past 34-year period, the actual maize sowing dates show a delaying tendency, at a rate of 1–6 days per decade, but there are significant fluctuations among years. For per day delay in the sowing dates, the whole growing season was shortened by 0.1%. Delaying sowing dates reduced the solar radiation interception during the vegetative period as well as the thermal time during the reproductive period. As a result, the overall maize potential yield was negatively affected in NEC; for per day delay in the sowing dates, the potential yield was decreased by 0.6%. By contrast, advancing sowing dates in some years led to increases in both the solar radiation interception during the vegetative period and the thermal time during the reproductive period. However, these increases showed various effects on the maize potential yield across different parts of the study region. We detected a positive effect of advancing sowing dates on maize potential yield in the high latitudes, at a rate of up to 1.6%. By contrast, in the low latitudes, the negative effect of advancing sowing dates on maize potential yield was dominant, at a rate of up to 2.7%.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagronomy 3aclimate change 3acorn 3agrain yield 3amodels 3aphenology 3asolar radiation 3avegetative growth 3aChina 0aAPSIM-Maize 0aMaize 0aPotential yield 0aSowing dates 0aAccumulated temperature zones1 aLiu, Zhijuan1 aQiao, Suliang1 aZhang, Zhentao1 aHuang, Qiuwan1 aSu, Zhenge1 aYang, Xiaoguang0 tEuropean journal of agronomy.g2022 May, v. 136 p.126511-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl49616x1161-03017nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.eja.2022.1265113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02318naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003200092040001800124100002000142242005300162245005300215300001100268520128800279592002801567650001901595650001501614650002901629650002901658650001501687650002201702650001601724650001501740700001701755700002001772773012201792856004501914852000901959655001201968IND4514188820221122083240.0140121e201212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND451418882DNAL7 a10.1186/2190-4715-24-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKammann, Ulrike10aBiological effects monitoring in marine research10aBiological effects monitoring in marine research  ap. 39.  aThe biological effects monitoring plays an important role in marine monitoring. Contaminants and their effects on fish as well as on other marine organisms belong to the main topics of international monitoring schemes. Biomarkers, as the measures of biological effects, have to meet essential requirements to be recommended on an international level. Among the prerequisites are assessment criteria to describe the main thresholds: to background contamination on one hand and to unacceptable effects and harm to the organism on the other hand. This article describes strategies and drawbacks of choosing and applying marker of contaminant effects to marine field samples. It reflects the actual stage of international guidelines for biological effects monitoring in marine fish and provides an outlook on future use of biomarker as part of an integrated assessments of the marine ecosystem. This goal is addressed in the EU marine strategy framework directive and other international programs. With this article we want to point out that the future of marine environmental assessment of contaminants will be closely linked to integrated monitoring - the combination of chemical monitoring and biological effects monitoring. Biological effects techniques are ready for this challenge.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEuropean Union 3abiomarkers 3aenvironmental assessment 3aenvironmental monitoring 3aguidelines 3amarine ecosystems 3amarine fish 3apollutants1 aLang, Thomas1 aWosniok, Werner0 tEnvironmental sciences Europe.g2012 Dec., v. 24, no. 1 p.39-39dSpringer-VerlagwJournal:J000001276x2190-47077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/2190-4715-24-1  aDNAL 7aarticle03367naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001600148245010700164300001800271520174700289592002802036596006902064596008502133650002202218650001302240650001502253650002002268650002202288650001602310650001802326650003102344650001702375650001702392650001502409650001902424650000902443650002002452650001902472650002502491650001002516651001002526700001402536700001502550700002002565700001502585700005102600773010702651856008202758852000902840655001202849IND60748814320221117110757.0210827e202109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074881432DNAL7 a10.1007/s10646-020-02320-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Tong10aRisk assessment and ecotoxicological diagnosis of soil from a chemical industry park in Nanjing, China  ap. 1303-1314.  aSoil pollution due to the activities of industrial parks, is becoming an increasingly serious issue, particularly throughout China. Therefore, it is essential to explore the soil pollution characteristics and its ecotoxicological effects on model species, such as higher plant species, in typical industrial areas. In this study, concentrations of heavy metals and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) were examined in the soil collected from 10 sampling sites at a chemical industry park in Nanjing, China. The pollution index was used to assess the heavy metal pollution level of soils, while the hazard index (HI) and carcinogenic risk index (RI) were calculated to assess the human health risk of soil PAHs. In addition, wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) was used as the model species to evaluate the ecotoxicological effects of polluted soil in pot experiments. Results showed that the content of heavy metals and PAHs varied greatly in soil samples, among which the heavy metal pollution at S1, S2 and S3 was the most serious. The health risk assessment of PAHs indicated that non-carcinogenic and carcinogenic values for all soil samples were below the threshold levels. Statistical analysis of the correlation between contaminated soil and toxic effects in wheat found that the significance values of regression equations were all less than 0.05 for chlorophyll content, peroxidase (POD) and amylase (AMS) activity. This indicates that the chlorophyll content, POD and AMS activity in wheat leaves could be suitable biomarkers for evaluation of the combined toxicity of multiple pollutants. This study provides a reference for future research on the risk assessment of soil containing multiple pollutants from industrial chemical parks.  aPublisher supplied data  a41773115, 41571468cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  aBE2012737, BE2016736cScience and Technology Support Program of Jiangsu Province 3aTriticum aestivum 3aamylases 3abiomarkers 3acarcinogenicity 3achemical industry 3achlorophyll 3aecotoxicology 3ahealth effects assessments 3aheavy metals 3ahuman health 3aperoxidase 3apolluted soils 3arisk 3arisk assessment 3asoil pollution 3astatistical analysis 3awheat 3aChina1 aLiu, Feng1 aYu, Xiezhi1 aJiang, Xiaofeng1 aCui, Yibin1 aLi, Mei1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0127-91730 tEcotoxicology.g2021 Sept., v. 30, no. 7 p.1303-1314dSpringer USwJournal:jnl3870048x0963-92927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10646-020-02320-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03033naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001200148245013600160300001100296500001400307520160000321592002801921650002701949650001301976650002301989650002602012650002002038650001002058650001502068650003702083650001702120650001202137650002202149650001502171650001402186650001702200650002402217650001302241651001102254700001202265700001602277700001602293700001702309773013302326856008302459852000902542655001202551IND60712462320221122103641.0210101e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071246232DNAL7 a10.1186/s12302-020-00331-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQu, Man10aExposure to low-dose nanopolystyrene induces the response of neuronal JNK MAPK signaling pathway in nematode Caenorhabditis elegans  ap. 58.  aNAL-light  aBACKGROUND: The response of organisms to nanoplastic exposure has gradually received the attention. Nevertheless, the role of neurons in response to nanoplastic exposure and the underlying mechanism are still largely unclear. We here examined the role of neuronal JNK MAPK signaling in response to low-dose of polystyrene (100 nm) in Caenorhabditis elegans. RESULTS: Exposure to nanopolystyrene in the range of μg/L could increase the expression of genes (jkk-1, mek-1, and jnk-1) encoding JNK MAPK signaling pathway. Meanwhile, RNAi knockdown of any of these genes induced a susceptibility to nanopolystyrene toxicity. In the neurons, SNB-1/synaptobrevin was identified as the downstream target of JNK-1/JNK, suggesting the alteration in neurotransmitter signals in nanopolystyrene-exposed nematodes. In nanopolystyrene-exposed nematodes, JNK-1 modulated TBH-1-mediated octopamine signal and CAT-2-mediated dopamine signal. TBH-1 and CAT-2 further regulated the response to nanopolystyrene by affecting the function of corresponding intestinal octopamine receptors (SER-6 and OCTR-1) and intestinal dopamine receptor (DOP-1). In the intestine, DOP-1 regulated the response to nanopolystyrene by activating the downstream signaling cascade in p38 MAPK signaling pathway. CONCLUSIONS: Exposure to low-dose of nanopolystyrene could induce the response of neuronal JNK MAPK signaling pathway in nematodes. Our data further highlight the crucial role of neuronal JNK MAPK signaling-activated alteration in octopamine and dopamine signals in regulating the response to nanopolystyrene in organisms.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCaenorhabditis elegans 3adopamine 3adopamine receptors 3aenvironmental science 3agene expression 3agenes 3aintestines 3amitogen-activated protein kinase 3ananoplastics 3aneurons 3aneurotransmitters 3aoctopamine 3aorganisms 3apolystyrenes 3asignal transduction 3atoxicity 3aEurope1 aLi, Dan1 aZhao, Yunli1 aYuan, Yujie1 aWang, Dayong0 tEnvironmental sciences Europe.g2020 Dec., v. 32, no. 1 p.58-58dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:J000001276x2190-47077nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12302-020-00331-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02375naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002800150245010000178500001900278520100800297592002801305650001901333650002001352650002001372650002501392653004101417653002801458653001301486653003101499653002901530700007101559700002001630700001701650700005601667700005801723773011401781856008501895852000901980655001201989IND60722716820221118124656.0210212e20210208xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072271682DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chroma.2020.4618682doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJohn, Annestasia Simbut10aOnline sample preconcentration techniques in nonaqueous capillary and microchip electrophoresis  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aOne of the major drawbacks of electrophoresis in both capillary and microchip is the unsatisfactory sensitivity. Online sample preconcentration techniques can be regarded as the most common and powerful approaches commonly applied to enhance overall detection sensitivity. While the advances of various online preconcentration strategies in capillary and microchip employing aqueous background electrolytes are well-reviewed, there has been limited discussion of the feasible preconcentration techniques specifically developed for capillary and microchip using nonaqueous background electrolytes. This review provides the first consolidated overview of various online preconcentration techniques in nonaqueous capillary and microchip electrophoresis, covering the period of the last two decades. It covers developments in the field of sample stacking, isotachophoresis, and micellar-based stacking. Attention is also given to multi-stacking strategies that have been used for nonaqueous electrophoresis.  aPublisher supplied data 3achromatography 3adetection limit 3aelectrophoresis 3amicrochip technology 0aNonaqueous capillary electrophoresis 0aOnline preconcentration 0aStacking 0aTransient-isotachophoresis 0aMicelle solvent stacking1 aSidek, Mohammad Mizwaruddin1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4442-96101 aThang, Lee Yien1 aSami, Sabita1 aTey, Hui Yin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3779-68291 aSee, Hong Heng1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7849-69290 tJournal of chromatography.g2021 Feb. 08, v. 1638 p.461868-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl50504x0021-96737nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chroma.2020.4618683Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03704naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003100111040001800142100001800160245011200178300001800290520202600308592002802334650002302362650001202385650001202397650001302409650001502422650001702437650001502454650000902469650001802478650001402496650001002510650001402520650001402534650001502548650001502563650002402578650001402602650001002616650004702626650001202673650001902685650004602704650002302750650002102773650001102794650002102805650002202826650001402848700001902862700001802881700001802899773009902917856007703016852000903093655001203102IND4450839920221120073949.0141101e201103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445083992DNAL7 a213388022pmid7 a10.3168/jds.2009-30252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKronqvist, C.10aEffects of prepartum dietary calcium level on calcium and magnesium metabolism in periparturient dairy cows  ap. 1365-1373.  aThe aim of this study was to investigate the effects of dietary Ca level (4.9, 9.3, and 13.6 g/kg of DM) on Ca and Mg homeostasis in dairy cows around parturition. Cows of the Swedish Red breed (n = 29) with no previous veterinary treatment for milk fever were divided into 3 groups, and each group was fed one of the different diets during the last 15 to 32 d of gestation. Calcium was added as ground limestone, and the Mg concentration was 1.8 g/kg of DM in all diets. After calving the cows were fed similar diets. Plasma was sampled twice per week until calving, and 6, 12, and 24 h, 2, 4, and 7 d after calving. Spot urine samples were collected twice weekly until calving and creatinine was used as a marker of daily urinary excretion. Fecal samples were collected 2 times per day for 5 d starting 2 wk before expected calving, and acid-insoluble ash was used as an indigestible marker to estimate digestibility. Apparent digestibility of Mg and daily Mg excretion in the urine were lower in the dry period for cows fed the highest Ca level. Plasma Mg concentration was lower on 2, 4, and 7 d after calving in cows fed the highest level of Ca. Treatment groups did not differ in plasma Ca concentration, parathyroid hormone concentration, or bone mobilization, evaluated using crosslinked carboxyterminal telopeptides of type I collagen (CTx) as a marker. Plasma Ca concentration decreased and plasma CTx concentration increased 6 h after calving. The apparent digestibility of Ca during the dry period was not affected by dietary Ca, but the cows fed 4.9 g Ca/kg of DM excreted 1.2 g of Ca/d in the urine, which was higher compared with 0.4 g/d and 0.6 g/d for the cows fed 9.3 g of Ca/kg of DM and 13.6 g of Ca/kg of DM, respectively. The results show that feeding 13.6 g of dietary Ca/kg of DM impaired the Mg absorption during the dry period, and resulted in decreased plasma Mg concentration after calving, but prepartum dietary Ca level did not affect plasma Ca, parathyroid hormone, or CTx concentrations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacid insoluble ash 3acalcium 3acalving 3acollagen 3acreatinine 3acrosslinking 3adairy cows 3adiet 3adigestibility 3aexcretion 3afeces 3alimestone 3amagnesium 3ametabolism 3amilk fever 3aparathyroid hormone 3apregnancy 3aurine 2aAnimal Nutritional Physiological Phenomena 2aAnimals 2aCalciumxblood 2aCalcium, Dietaryxadministration & dosage 2aCattlexmetabolism 2aDietxveterinary 2aFemale 2aMagnesiumxblood 2aPeripartum Period 2aPregnancy1 aEmanuelson, U.1 aSpörndly, R.1 aHoltenius, K.0 tJournal of dairy science.g2011 Mar., v. 94, no. 3 p.1365-1373dElsevier Inc.x0022-03027nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3168/jds.2009-30253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02754naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002600150245012400176500001900300520130300319592002801622650001201650650001101662650002101673650001501694650001901709650000701728650001701735650002701752650001301779650001701792650001401809653001201823653003001835653003001865653002701895653003701922700002001959700006201979700002902041700001802070773011402088856008502202852000902287655001202296IND60712990420221119203648.0201104e20201108xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071299042DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chroma.2020.4615592doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKāmrān, Muḥammad,10aHighly efficient porous sorbent derived from asphalt for the solid-phase extraction of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aPolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are generated primarily during the incomplete combustion of organic matter and are ubiquitous environmental pollutants. For the first time, in this study, a mesoporous carbon derived from asphalt with high surface area (2300 m²g⁻¹ with an average of 1.2 cm³ g⁻¹) was utilized as a sorbent for the solid-phase extraction (SPE) of several PAHs in tap water samples. The factors influencing the extraction capability of the new material were investigated and the optimum conditions were determined to be as follows: Sample volume - 200 mL, no adjustment of sample pH, and sorbent amount - 50 mg. Under the most favorable SPE conditions, with gas chromatography-mass spectrometric analysis, the method exhibited a linear range of 0.5-50 μgL⁻¹ with limits of detection between 0.004 and 0.026 μgL⁻¹. The recoveries obtained from spiked tap water samples spiked at 1 μgL⁻¹ and 5 μgL⁻¹, were in the range 86.7-98.2% with relative standard deviations of <9%. The method was also applied to tap water samples collected from the local environment. The concentrations of PAHs detected ranged between 0.13 and 48 μgL⁻¹. The reusability of the sorbent was tested with five consecutive SPE extraction, and no carryover of analytes was observed.  aPublisher supplied data 3abitumen 3acarbon 3achemical species 3acombustion 3aorganic matter 3apH 3aporous media 3asolid phase extraction 3asorbents 3asurface area 3atap water 0aAsphalt 0aHigh surface area sorbent 0aEnvironmental application 0aSolid-phase extraction 0aPolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons1 aDauda, Mohammed1 aBasheer, Chanbasha1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6105-28221 aSiddiqui, Mohammad Nahid1 aLee, Hian Kee0 tJournal of chromatography.g2020 Nov. 08, v. 1631 p.461559-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl50504x0021-96737nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chroma.2020.4615593Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01918naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100003300140245009000173300001600263500002000279500001500299520042100314592002800735650003200763650002200795650002100817650001000838650000800848650002200856650001000878650001900888650003000907650002500937650002600962650001400988650001901002650000901021651001101030653002801041700002301069700001901092700002001111700001801131700005701149773013501206856007401341852000901415655001201424IND60602093720221121021841.0180709e201808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060209372DNAL7 a10.1111/tbed.128922doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMazzuchelli‐de‐Souza, J.10aFirst detection of bovine papillomavirus type 2 in cutaneous wart lesions from ovines  ap. 939-943.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  a2019-12-06  aThis study diagnosed cutaneous wart lesions excised from three rams from a sheep farm in São Paulo State, Brazil.

Water resources in the Murray-Darling Basin have been over-allocated for irrigation use with the consequent degradation of freshwater ecosystems. In line with integrated water resource management principles, Australian Government reforms are reducing the amount of water diverted for irrigation to improve ecosystem health. However, limited understanding of the broader benefits and trade-offs associated with reducing irrigation diversions has hampered the planning process supporting this reform. Ecosystem services offer an integrative framework to identify the broader benefits associated with integrated water resource management in the Murray-Darling Basin, thereby providing support for the Government to reform decision-making. We conducted a multi-criteria decision analysis for ranking regional potentials to provide ecosystem services at river basin scale. We surveyed the wider public about their understanding of, and priorities for, managing ecosystem services and then integrated the results with spatially explicit indicators of ecosystem service provision. The preliminary results of this work identified the sub-catchments with the greatest potential synergies and trade-offs of ecosystem service provision under the integrated water resources management reform process. With future development, our framework could be used as a decision support tool by those grappling with the challenge of the sustainable allocation of water between irrigation and the environment.  aPublisher supplied data 3adecision support systems 3aecosystem services 3afreshwater ecosystems 3airrigation 3amulti-criteria decision making 3aplanning 3asubwatersheds 3awater allocation 3awater resources 2aConservation of Natural Resourcesxmethods 2aDecision Support Techniques 2aEcologyxmethods 2aEcosystem 2aModels, Theoretical 2aPolicy Making 2aRivers 2aWater Resources 3aAustralia 0aAustralia 0aWatershed 0aRiver basin 0aIntegrated catchment management 0aInternet survey 0aWater resources accounting 0aNatural capital 0aEcosystem service indicators1 aCrossman, Neville D.1 aNolan, Martin1 aGhirmay, Hiyoba0 tJournal of environmental management.g2013 Nov. 15, v. 129 p.92-102dElsevier Ltdx0301-47977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2013.06.0473Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02443naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001700152245011100169520104400280592002801324650001701352650001501369650001401384650001701398650001001415650001101425650002801436650001501464650001901479650001201498650001701510653001801527653001901545653001801564700005201582700001501634700001301649700001601662700005401678700001801732700001401750700001301764773010001777856008701877852000901964655001201973IND60697857320221119213254.0200809e20201130xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069785732DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2020.1272032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Lihui10aInfluence of high hydrostatic pressure pretreatment on properties of vacuum-freeze dried strawberry slices  aEffects of high hydrostatic pressure (HHP) (50, 100, 150, 200 and 250 MPa) pretreatment on water mobility and distribution, drying duration, microstructure, color, cell wall fraction and tissue structure of strawberry slices were investigated. HHP significantly increased water mobility of the strawberry slices, resulting in the reduction of drying duration by 9–24%. As the pretreatment pressure was increased, redness value and anthocyanin content continuously increased, soluble pectin (SBP) content increased and then decreased, while the contents of protopectin (PTP) and cellulose decreased. After the HHP pretreatment, chromoplasts and moisture was distributed more uniformly in the strawberry slices. Microscopy images showed the formation of microscopic holes or channels in the matrix and the breakdown of tissue structure by HHP. Results suggested HHP pretreatment disrupted the integrity of the fresh strawberry which enhanced the drying efficiency and migration of the chromoplasts during the vacuum-freeze drying process.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanthocyanins 3acell walls 3acellulose 3achromoplasts 3acolor 3adrying 3ahigh pressure treatment 3amicroscopy 3amicrostructure 3apectins 3astrawberries 0aLow-field NMR 0aWater mobility 0aDrying curves1 aQiao, Yu1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2276-01611 aWang, Chao1 aLiao, Li1 aShi, Defang1 aAn, Kejing1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7743-59051 aHu, Jianzhong1 aWang, Jun1 aShi, Liu0 tFood chemistry.g2020 Nov. 30, v. 331 p.127203-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8139x0308-81467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2020.1272033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03081naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001600153245010400169300001600273520165900289592002801948650002201976650001801998650001302016650001402029650002102043650001702064650001602081650001902097650000902116650002302125650001102148650000702159650002402166650001302190650001702203653002402220653002302244653001302267653003402280653001602314700002102330700001702351700002202368773010002390856008802490852000902578655001202587IND60585459120221120123210.0180914e201712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058545912DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apgeochem.2017.10.0202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Haiyan10aRare earth elements sorption to iron oxyhydroxide: Model development and application to groundwater  ap. 158-166.  aIron oxyhydroxides are among the most important colloids that control rare earth elements (REE) concentrations and transport in natural hydrosystems. In this study, REE surface complexation to iron oxyhydroxides (Fe(OH)3(a)) was described by using the Donnan diffuse layer model and a two-site (i.e. ≡FeˢOH and ≡FeʷOH) model. The specific surface area and pH of zero charge were fixed as 100000 m²/mol and 8.0, respectively. The surface site density for weak and strong binding sites were fixed at 0.1 moL/mol Fe (≡FeʷOH) and 0.001 moL/mol Fe (≡FeˢOH) respectively. The two site types were used with pKa1ⁱⁿᵗ = 7.29 and pKa2ⁱⁿᵗ = 8.93. Using linear free energy relationship, the estimated equilibrium surface complexation constants (log K) increased from light REE (LREE) to heavy REE (HREE). Results of REE modeling calculation using the determined log K revealed a good fit of experimental data, showing an order of sorption on iron oxyhydroxides: HREE > MREE > LREE and preferential sorption of HREE at a lower pH. However, sorption edges only showed a slight change with ionic strength (0.1–0.7 moL/L) for the whole REE series. The generalized model was subsequently used to evaluate the impact of iron oxyhydroxides on REE speciation in groundwater. Application of the model to “model groundwater” showed that iron oxyhydroxide complexes of REE were significant in near neutral and weakly alkaline pH. This study contributes to putting forward a comprehensive database which would be useful for the application of surface complexation model to describe REE sorption by amorphous ferric hydroxides in nature.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGibbs free energy 3abinding sites 3acolloids 3adatabases 3aferric hydroxide 3ageochemistry 3agroundwater 3aionic strength 3airon 3airon oxyhydroxides 3amodels 3apH 3arare earth elements 3asorption 3asurface area 0aRare earth elements 0aIron oxyhydroxides 0aSorption 0aSurface complexation modeling 0aGroundwater1 aPourret, Olivier1 aGuo, Huaming1 aBonhoure, Jessica0 tApplied geochemistry.g2017 Dec., v. 87 p.158-166dElsevier LtdwJournal:11912x0883-29277nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apgeochem.2017.10.0203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01808naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245007300169300001600242520086600258592002801124650002801152650001101180650000901191650002201200700002601222700002101248700001801269773012901287856008101416852000901497655001201506IND60437436620221120155825.0151022e201509  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6043743662DNAL7 a10.1007/s00107-015-0932-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRoche, Stéphane,10aOn the semi-rigidity of dovetail joint for the joinery of LVL panels  ap. 667-675.  aThis paper focuses on multiple tab-and-slot joints (MTSJ) for load-carrying assembly of structural wood elements, which are inspired by traditional cabinetmaking joints and adapted for automatic fabrication and engineered wood panels such as laminated veneer lumber. First a numerical method is presented for the estimation of the connections’ semi-rigid properties based on box beam samples. In a simplified model, the mechanical behavior of the joint is represented by potential elastic slips at interfaces. They are handled by the model with the help of rigidity modulus, which is determined by matching simulated and experimental deflections. Finally, the influence of tab length and contact face angle on the semi-rigidity of the joint is discussed considering a dovetail geometry of the MTSJ. Glued and screwed samples serve as references in this study.  aPublisher supplied data 3alaminated veneer lumber 3amodels 3awood 3awood-based panels1 aRobeller, Christopher1 aHumbert, Laurent1 aWeinand, Yves0 tEuropean journal of wood and wood products.g2015 Sept., v. 73, no. 5 p.667-675dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx0018-37687nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00107-015-0932-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03238naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245013500170500001900305520180000324592002802124650002802152650001002180650002802190650001302218650001602231653005602247653002802303653004902331653002702380653001502407700001902422700002102441700002302462700002402485700001702509700002402526700005902550773011402609856008402723852000902807655001202816IND60712990620221119203553.0201023e20201025xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071299062DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chroma.2020.4615612doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWicht, Kristina10aPharmaceutical impurity analysis by comprehensive two-dimensional temperature responsive × reversed phase liquid chromatography  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aIn this study, the possibilities of temperature responsive × reversed phase liquid chromatography (TRLC × RPLC) are assessed in terms of pharmaceutical impurity analysis. Due to the increased peak capacity per unit time they offer, two-dimensional LC approaches are gaining relevance for the analysis of complex drug formulations. Because the latter depicts a larger predisposition for the occurrence of an increased number of impurities, current 1D-HPLC approaches often prove insufficient. Since many LC × LC methods are limited by modulation, solvent compatibility, orthogonality, and sensitivity issues, the combination of TRLC × RPLC is explored in this work for pharmaceutical impurity analysis. As this combination of a purely aqueous separation with RPLC allows for systematic and optimization-free refocusing in the second dimension, it opens possibilities for generic LC × LC requiring minimal to no method development, in this way overcoming a major perceived contemporary hurdle of LC × LC. The approach is demonstrated with a representative mixture of 17 solutes comprising 11 corticosteroids and 6 progestogens. Orthogonality and peak capacities were assessed on three RP core-shell column selectivities (Poroshell EC-C18, phenyl-hexyl and PFP). Although the TRLC × EC-C18 combination offered somewhat better orthogonality, the combination with the PFP column proved the best for the separation at hand. Depending on the composition of the mixture, the use of full, shifted, or segmented gradients allowed facile optimization of the separation. The developed platform allowed detection of the impurities at the 0.05% level compared to a selected main compound, while also opening up possibilities for analysis of formulations comprising two active ingredients.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadrenal cortex hormones 3adrugs 3aprogestational hormones 3asolvents 3atemperature 0aComprehensive two-dimensional liquid chromatography 0aPharmaceutical analysis 0aTemperature responsive liquid chromatography 0aImpurity determination 0aRefocusing1 aBaert, Mathijs1 aKajtazi, Ardiana1 aSchipperges, Sonja1 avon Doehren, Norwin1 aDesmet, Gert1 ade Villiers, André1 aLynen, Frederic1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4690-76900 tJournal of chromatography.g2020 Oct. 25, v. 1630 p.461561-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl50504x0021-96737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chroma.2020.4615613Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03208naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100006200153245009100215300001600306520184400322592002802166650001302194650001502207650001702222650003202239650000902271650001302280650001802293650000702311650002202318650001702340650001602357650002702373651001202400653000902412653002102421653001802442653002102460653002302481700002402504700002502528773010002553856008802653852000902741655001202750IND60585459220221120123248.0180914e201712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058545922DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apgeochem.2017.10.0212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKaasalainen, Hanna1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3382-176410aGeochemistry and speciation of Fe(II) and Fe(III) in natural geothermal water, Iceland  ap. 146-157.  aThe geochemistry of Fe(II) and Fe(III) was studied in natural geothermal waters in Iceland. Samples of surface and spring water and sub-boiling geothermal well water were collected and analyzed for Fe(II), Fe(III) and Fetotal concentrations. The samples had discharge temperatures in the range 27–99 °C, pH between 2.46 and 9.77 and total dissolved solids 155–1090 mg/L. The concentrations of Fe(II) and Fe(III) were determined in the <0.2 μm filtered and acidified fraction using a field-deployed ion chromatography spectrophotometry (IC-Vis) method within minutes to a few hours of sampling in order to prevent post-sampling changes. The concentrations of Fe(II) and Fe(III) were <0.1–130 μmoL/L and <0.2–42 μmoL/L, respectively. In-situ dialysis coupled with Fe(II) and Fe(III) determinations suggest that in some cases a significant fraction of Fe passing the standard <0.2 μm filtration method may be present in colloidal/particulate form. Therefore, such filter size may not truly represent the dissolved fraction of Fe but also nano-sized particles. The Fe(II) and Fe(III) speciation and Fetotal concentrations are largely influenced by the water pH, which in turn reflects the water type formed through various processes. In water having pH of ∼7–9, the total Fe concentrations were <2 μmoL/L with Fe(III) predominating. With decreasing pH, the total Fe concentrations increased with Fe(II) becoming increasingly important and predominating at pH < 3. In particular in waters having pH ∼6 and above, iron redox equilibrium may be approached with Fe(II) and Fe(III) possibly being controlled by equilibrium with respect to Fe minerals. In many acid waters, the Fe(II) and Fe(III) distribution may not have reached equilibrium and be controlled by the source(s), reaction kinetics or microbial reactions.  aPublisher supplied data 3adialysis 3afiltration 3ageochemistry 3aion exchange chromatography 3airon 3aminerals 3ananoparticles 3apH 3areaction kinetics 3aspectroscopy 3atemperature 3atotal dissolved solids 3aIceland 0aIron 0aRedox speciation 0aNatural water 0aGeothermal water 0aNanoparticulate Fe1 aStefánsson, Andri,1 aDruschel, Gregory K.0 tApplied geochemistry.g2017 Dec., v. 87 p.146-157dElsevier LtdwJournal:11912x0883-29277nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apgeochem.2017.10.0213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03634naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002300143245006200166506002800228520196600256592002802222506003702250650001602287650002002303650001402323650003202337650003902369650001402408650001702422650002502439650001402464650001402478650002702492650002002519650002002539650001402559650001602573650002302589650002202612650001702634650001902651650001202670651001302682653009402695700002502789700002002814700003902834773012002873856007802993961001203071852000903083655001203092IND60785122120221207095249.0210419s2021    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078512212DNAL7 a10.15835/nbha491122222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aANDRADE, Carlos G.10aViral diagnosis in cultivars of Ipomoea batatas (L.) Lam.  aResource is Open Access  aIpomoea batatas (L.) Lam. commonly known as sweet potato, is an important staple food worldwide, mainly due to its high nutritional value and yield. However, vegetative reproduction of sweet potato makes it more susceptible to viral infections, which threatens its productivity, quality, and difficult long-term preservation in germplasm banks. Also, it can act as a virus reservoir infecting the rest of the plant accessions in the bank collections. Hence, this work aimed to screen Begomovirus, Potyvirus, and Carlavirus infections in 16 traditional sweet potato cultivars from the germplasm collection of the ISOPlexis Germplasm Bank, Madeira, Portugal. The infection prevalence by these viruses among cultivars was 81.25%, 25.00%, and 6.25%, respectively; being ISOP1011 the only accession coinfected by Potyvirus and Carlavirus. The accessions ISOP1006, ISOP1010, and ISOP1047 were also coinfected by Begomovirus and Potyvirus, highlighting their vulnerability to viral infections. The ISOP1005 and ISOP1027 accessions were the only ones not infected by any of these viruses. The analysis of the partial sequence obtained from the Carlavirus detected in the accession ISOP1011, revealed the existence of an ORF that encodes for 93 amino acids of the catalytic domain of an RNA-directed RNA polymerase related to the Tymovirus protein family, as could be confirmed by comparison with proteins stored in UniProtKB. Multiple sequence alignment with these proteins showed that Motifs A and B of the catalytic domain were conserved. The search for sequence similarity with sequences deposited in GenBank reported a high sequence identity with Sweet potato yellow mottle virus (SPYMV) and Sweet potato chlorotic fleck virus (SPCFV). However, the 9-11% discrepancy in nucleotide sequence identity and a phylogenetic analysis carried out using the maximum probability method suggests the virus isolated from ISOP1011 is a new divergent strain of the SPCFV species.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aBegomovirus 3aIpomoea batatas 3aPotyvirus 3aRNA-directed RNA polymerase 3aSweet potato chlorotic fleck virus 3aTymovirus 3aactive sites 3aasexual reproduction 3acultivars 3agermplasm 3agermplasm conservation 3amixed infection 3anutritive value 3aphylogeny 3aprobability 3asequence alignment 3asequence homology 3astaple foods 3asweet potatoes 3aviruses 3aPortugal 0aCarlavirus; cultivars; sweet potato; germplasm bank; molecular diagnosis; RdRp; phylogeny1 aEmanuel M.  da SILVA1 aRAGONEZI, Carla1 aMiguel Â.

Considering several adsorption sites in the clay minerals’ structure allows accurately representing the overall variations of adsorption behaviours. For a wider applicability in soils and sediments, it appears necessary to build a coherent thermodynamic adsorption database for radionuclides. ⁹⁰Sr and ¹³⁴,¹³⁷Cs are major radionuclides to be considered in the case of nuclear accidents, but thermodynamic data on their adsorption on purified smectites are scarce. Therefore, a detailed study to determine Sr²⁺ and Cs⁺ adsorption parameter on smectite seems necessary. To provide this kind of information, this study is proposing multi-site ion exchange modelling of the adsorption of Sr²⁺ and Cs⁺ onto a pure Na-MX80 montmorillonite. The intrinsic parameters—site concentration and corrected selectivity coefficient for the Na⁺/H⁺ exchange—were first fitted using an already available Na saturation curve of a purified smectite. The adsorption of Sr²⁺ and Cs⁺ on a purified Na-MX80 bentonite was explored, including a kinetic study for Sr, as a function of pH and equilibrium concentration. The isotherms were modelled to determine the corrected selectivity coefficients for the 2Na⁺/Sr²⁺ and Na⁺/Cs⁺ exchange reactions. This study provides a part of a wider databasis that is currently under construction, which can be used to predict the adsorption of Sr and Cs in soils and sediments.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaccidents 3aadsorption 3abentonite 3acations 3acesium 3adatabases 3ageochemistry 3aion exchange 3amodels 3amontmorillonite 3apH 3aradionuclides 3asediments 3asmectite 3asodium 3asoil 3astrontium 3athermodynamics 0aAdsorption 0aCesium 0aCaesium 0aStrontium 0aSmectite 0aModelling 0aMulti-site ion exchange model1 aBeaucaire, Catherine1 aTabarant, Michel1 aBenedetti, Marc F.1 aReiller, Pascal E.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7317-359X0 tApplied geochemistry.g2017 Dec., v. 87 p.167-175dElsevier LtdwJournal:11912x0883-29277nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apgeochem.2017.10.0223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04248naa a2200673 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245012300167300001600290520234700306592002802653650001502681650001202696650001702708650001102725650002002736650001302756650001202769650002002781650001802801650001902819650001202838650001302850650001502863650001402878650001502892650001502907650002002922650001502942650001602957650001202973650002302985650001903008650002103027650001903048650001703067650001203084650002803096650002503124650001003149651001303159653002403172653001203196653001403208653002103222653001903243700001303262700001403275700001903289700001603308773014503324856008403469852000903553655001203562IND60123196220221118025846.0150325e20140903xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012319622DNAL7 a10.1080/13504509.2014.9611812doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDesalegn, T.10aLand-use/land-cover (LULC) change and socioeconomic conditions of local community in the central highlands of Ethiopia  ap. 406-413.  aThis paper presents a case study of land-use/land-cover (LULC) changes from 1975 to 2014 in the central highlands of Ethiopia and traces out its impact on socioeconomic conditions of the local community in the study area. We used four time series Landsat satellite images, that is, Landsat MSS (1975), Landsat Thematic Mapper (1986), Enhanced Thematic Mapper (2000), and Landsat 8 OLI scenes (2014), to investigate the changes in LULC. In addition, individual interviews with 51 randomly selected households, discussions with focus group and key informants, and field observations were also incorporated for the study. The image classification indicated four categories of LULC classes: Natural forest, eucalyptus plantations, cropland/settlements, and grasslands. Between 1975 and 2014, cropland/settlements and eucalyptus plantations considerably increased, whereas grassland cover drastically decreased. According to the results, the area under cropland/settlements and eucalyptus plantations increased by 62 and 335%, respectively, with 74% concomitant decrease in the area of grasslands in the same period. Survey results showed that deterioration of soil fertility (41.2%) followed by shortage of land (35.3%) is the major constraint for crop production for poor farmers in the study area. However, better-off farmers ranked deterioration of soil fertility (64.7%) followed by lack of credit (17.6%) as priority constraints for crop production. Interviews mainly focused on selected women group revealed that the expansion of eucalyptus in the area greatly curbed the burdens of collecting fuel woods from long distances in the past. The availability of too many religious holidays (on average 16 days/month) directly or indirectly contributes to the current seasonal food shortages of the community. Generally, our results show that the community in the study area is beset with a host of social, economic, and institutional challenges. As a result, majority of the farming households are destitute, unable to make a livelihood from their small plot of land and live in absolute poverty. Therefore, in light of these finding, it is imperative that timely interventions by government and other development stakeholders are needed to come to grips with problems of soil fertility, land-use change, and food insecurity in the study area.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEucalyptus 3aLandsat 3acase studies 3acredit 3acrop production 3acropland 3afarmers 3afarming systems 3afood security 3afood shortages 3aforests 3afuelwood 3agrasslands 3ahighlands 3ahouseholds 3ainterviews 3aland use change 3alivelihood 3aplantations 3apoverty 3areligious holidays 3aremote sensing 3asoil degradation 3asoil fertility 3astakeholders 3asurveys 3asustainable development 3atime series analysis 3awomen 3aEthiopia 0aland use/land cover 0aLandsat 0ahighlands 0ahousehold survey 0asoil fertility1 aCruz, F.1 aKindu, M.1 aTurrión, M.B.1 aGonzalo, J.0 tinternational journal of sustainable development and world ecology.g2014 Sept. 3, v. 21, no. 5 p.406-413dTaylor & Francisx1745-26277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13504509.2014.9611813Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03042naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100005500140245009700195300001800292500002000310520137800330592002801708650002201736650002201758650001001780650002201790650003001812650001001842650001101852650002401863650001501887650001401902650002501916650001001941650001201951651001201963651001201975651001601987651001202003700001802015700001402033700001802047700001402065700001802079700001602097700001402113700001702127700001402144700001802158700005402176700001402230773013702244856007402381852000902455655001202464IND60602094120221121010002.0180709e201808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060209412DNAL7 a10.1111/tbed.128492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTakemae, N.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5152-893810aAppearance of reassortant European avian‐origin H1 influenza A viruses of swine in Vietnam  ap. 1110-1116.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThree subtypes—H1N1, H1N2 and H3N2—of influenza A viruses of swine (IAVs‐S) are currently endemic in swine worldwide, but there is considerable genotypic diversity among each subtype and limited geographical distribution. Through IAVs‐S monitoring in Vietnam, two H1N2 influenza A viruses were isolated from healthy pigs in Ba Ria‐Vung Tau Province, Southern Vietnam, on 2 December 2016. BLAST and phylogenetic analyses revealed that their HA and NA genes were derived from those of European avian‐like H1N2 IAVs‐S that contained avian‐origin H1 and human‐like N2 genes, and were particularly closely related to those of IAVs‐S circulating in the Netherlands, Germany or Denmark. In addition, the internal genes of these Vietnamese isolates were derived from human A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses, suggesting that the Vietnamese H1N2 IAVs‐S are reassortants between European H1N2 IAVs‐S and human A(H1N1)pdm09v. The appearance of European avian‐like H1N2 IAVs‐S in Vietnam marks their first transmission outside Europe. Our results and statistical analyses of the number of live pigs imported into Vietnam suggest that the European avian‐like H1N2 IAVs‐S may have been introduced into Vietnam with their hosts through international trade. These findings highlight the importance of quarantining imported pigs to impede the introduction of new IAVs‐S.  aPublisher supplied data 3aInfluenza A virus 3aemerging diseases 3agenes 3agenetic variation 3ageographical distribution 3ahosts 3ahumans 3ainternational trade 3amonitoring 3aphylogeny 3astatistical analysis 3aswine 3aviruses 3aDenmark 3aGermany 3aNetherlands 3aVietnam1 aNguyen, P.

The new curriculum is a fundamental departure from the traditional curriculum that had served the veterinary profession in Ireland over many years. The change was not a precipitate action but the outcome of a prolonged and thorough examination of the realities of veterinary medicine, its science and its art, in the first decade of a new millennium. Over recent decades, rapid and fundamental changes have been witnessed in the economic, cultural, and ethical environment in which the veterinary profession operates, and these changes, coupled with the “information explosion,” dictated an examination of the educational paradigm. The new curriculum exposes the first-year class to veterinary information technology and problem-based learning (PBL). In the second year, students are instructed in clinical examination, history taking, and client communication skills, in addition to further exposure to PBL. The third and fourth years are now systems-based, with coordinated input from microbiologists, parasitologists, pathologists, and clinicians in teaching each body system. The first lecture-free final year in the 104-year history of veterinary education in Ireland consists of clinical rotations and a four-week elective pursued within the faculty or at other recognized institutions. Students must also complete a minimum of 24 weeks’ extramural studies (EMS). Critically, the development and assessment of all courses in the new undergraduate degree program has been driven by carefully thought out learning outcomes. The new curriculum will provide graduates with the essential knowledge and skills required for entry into the veterinary profession. Society expects these qualities from veterinarians in the interests of the communities they serve during their professional careers. In addition, the curriculum should foster the ability to adapt to changing circumstances, instill the desire and ability to work in teams, and develop life skills. It is hoped that the academic innovations will arouse the intellectual curiosity and commitment to lifelong learning that future graduates will require if they are to retain the confidence of the society in which they work in the future.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadult education 3aclinical examination 3acommunication skills 3acurriculum 3aethics 3ainformation technology 3alearning 3alife skills 3aoccupations 3asociety 3astudents 3ateams 3aveterinarians 3aveterinary education 3aveterinary medicine 3aIreland1 aJones, Boyd R.0 tJournal of veterinary medical education.g2006 Jan. 1, v. 33, no. 2 p.214-219dUniversity of Toronto Pressx0748-321X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3138%2Fjvme.33.2.2143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02594naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001400153245015000167300001600317520113000333592002801463650002801491650002001519650001401539650002201553650001701575650001601592650001501608650002001623650001201643653002201655653002801677653000801705653001201713653001701725653001901742653001801761653002201779700001801801700002001819700001601839700001501855700001501870700001801885773010001903856008802003852000902091655001202100IND60585459420221120122743.0190516e201804  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058545942DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apgeochem.2017.10.0232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJones, A.10aMachine learning techniques to repurpose Uranium Ore Concentrate (UOC) industrial records and their application to nuclear forensic investigation  ap. 221-227.  aThe discipline of nuclear forensics has emerged in response to the illicit trafficking of nuclear materials and aims to determine the provenance of intercepted materials by comparing them to a database of samples of known origin. One of the major challenges of this approach is the availability of reliable inventory data for the various radioactive materials that may be intercepted. Analysing the representative samples is a lengthy process and it can be difficult to obtain data from legacy materials. Therefore previous nuclear forensic studies have often been based on datasets of very limited size. We propose an approach to repurpose pre-existing quality control inventory data from Uranium Ore Concentrates (UOCs) such that it can be exploited for nuclear forensic investigation. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that pattern recognition techniques can be used to successfully utilise this data to reliably infer the country and deposit group of material origin. We have also demonstrated methods for overcoming the issues associated with quality control records; missing data and data represented as less than values.  aPublisher supplied data 3aartificial intelligence 3adata collection 3adatabases 3aforensic sciences 3ageochemistry 3ainventories 3aprovenance 3aquality control 3auranium 0aNuclear forensics 0aUranium Ore Concentrate 0aUOC 0aDeposit 0aMissing data 0aClassification 0aVisualisation 0aFeature selection1 aKeatley, A.C.1 aGoulermas, J.Y.1 aScott, T.B.1 aTurner, P.1 aAwbery, R.1 aStapleton, M.0 tApplied geochemistry.g2018 Apr., v. 91 p.221-227dElsevier LtdwJournal:11912x0883-29277nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apgeochem.2017.10.0233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02880naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001900153245009800172300001600270520147200286592002801758650001701786650002201803650001201825650001201837650001401849650001701863650001301880650001301893650001101906650001401917650001301931650002301944650001601967653001201983653001601995653002602011653001502037653002902052700001502081700001702096700001802113700001402131700001602145700001502161773010202176856008702278852000902365655001202374IND60531551720221122014020.0170626e20160815xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053155172DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2016.03.2482doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCui, Xiaoqiang10aPotential mechanisms of cadmium removal from aqueous solution by Canna indica derived biochar  ap. 517-525.  aThe objective of this study was to investigate the mechanisms of cadmium (Cd) sorption on biochars produced at different temperature (300–600°C) and their quantitative contribution. The sorption isotherms and kinetics of Cd2+ sorption on biochars were determined and fitted to different models. The Cd2+ sorption data could be well described by a simple Langmuir model, and the pseudo second order kinetic model best fitted the kinetic data. The maximum sorption capacity (Qm) obtained from the Langmuir model for CIB500 was 188.8mgg−1, which was greater than that of biochars produced at other temperature. Precipitation with minerals, ion exchange, complexation with surface oxygen-containing functional groups, and coordination with π electrons were the possible mechanisms of Cd2+ sorption on the biochars. The contribution of each mechanism varied with the pyrolysis temperature. With increasing pyrolysis temperature, the contribution of surface complexation and metal ion exchange decreased from 24.5% and 43.3% to 0.7% and 4.7%, while the contribution of precipitation and Cd2+-π interaction significantly increased from 29.7% and 2.5% to 89.5% and 5.1%, respectively. Overall, the precipitation with minerals and metal ion exchange dominated Cd2+ sorption on the biochars (accounted for 73.0–94.1%), and precipitation with minerals was the primary mechanism of Cd2+ sorption on the high-temperature biochars (≥500°C) (accounted for 86.1–89.5%).  aPublisher supplied data 3aCanna indica 3aaqueous solutions 3abiochar 3acadmium 3aelectrons 3aion exchange 3akinetics 3aminerals 3amodels 3apyrolysis 3asorption 3asorption isotherms 3atemperature 0aBiochar 0aHeavy metal 0aPyrolysis temperature 0aMechanisms 0aSorption characteristics1 aFang, Siyu1 aYao, Yiqiang1 aLi, Tingqiang1 aNi, Qijun1 aYang, Xiaoe1 aHe, Zhenli0 tScience of the total environment.g2016 Aug. 15, v. 562 p.517-525dElsevier B.V.x0048-96977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2016.03.2483Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03410naa a2200649 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004100111040001800152100002600170245010400196300001600300520138300316592002801699650001001727650001601737650001101753650002101764650002401785650001501809650002101824650001701845650000901862650001701871650001101888650001401899650002001913650002401933650002601957650001801983650001802001650001202019650005102031650002502082650001902107650001602126650004302142650000902185650001102194650006602205650000902271650007802280650003202358650001702390650003002407700002202437700002102459700002302480700001902503700002402522773010602546856008702652852000902739655001202748IND4451692520221120231607.0141112e20110501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445169252DNAL7 a213455052pmid7 a10.1016/j.prevetmed.2011.01.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGlickman, Lawrence T.10aAssociation between chronic azotemic kidney disease and the severity of periodontal disease in dogs  ap. 193-200.  aNaturally occurring periodontal disease affects >75% of dogs and has been associated with cardiac lesions and presumptive endocarditis. However, the relationships between periodontal disease and chronic kidney disease (CKD) in dogs have not been studied. In a retrospective longitudinal study the incidence of azotemic CKD was compared between a cohort of 164,706 dogs with periodontal disease and a cohort of age-matched dogs with no periodontal disease from a national primary care practice. These dogs contributed 415,971 dog-years of follow-up from 2002 to 2008. Hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals from Cox regression were used to compare the incidence of azotemic CKD in dogs with stage 1, 2, or 3/4 periodontal disease to dogs with no periodontal disease. The hazard ratio for azotemic CKD increased with increasing severity of periodontal disease (stage 1 hazard ratio=1.8, 95% confidence interval: 1.6, 2.1; stage 2 hazard ratio=2.0, 95% confidence interval: 1.7, 2.3; stage 3/4 hazard ratio=2.7, 95% confidence interval: 2.3, 3.0; Pₜᵣₑₙd=<0.0001) after adjustment for age, gender, neuter status, breed, body weight, number of hospital visits, and dental procedures. Increasing severity of periodontal disease was also associated with serum creatinine >1.4mg/dl and blood urea nitrogen >36mg/dl, independent of a veterinarian's clinical diagnosis of CKD.  aPublisher supplied data 3ablood 3abody weight 3abreeds 3achronic diseases 3aconfidence interval 3acreatinine 3adisease severity 3adog diseases 3adogs 3aendocarditis 3agender 3ahospitals 3akidney diseases 3aregression analysis 3aretrospective studies 3aurea nitrogen 3aveterinarians 2aAnimals 2aAzotemiaxepidemiologyxpathologyxveterinary. 2aCase-Control Studies 2aCohort Studies 2aComorbidity 2aDog Diseasesxepidemiologyxpathology. 2aDogs 2aFemale 2aKidney Failure, Chronicxepidemiologyxpathologyxveterinary. 2aMale 2aPeriodontal Diseasesxcomplicationsxepidemiologyxpathologyxveterinary. 2aProportional Hazards Models 2aRisk Factors 2aSeverity of Illness Index1 aGlickman, Nita W.1 aMoore, George E.1 aLund, Elizabeth M.1 aLantz, Gary C.1 aPressler, Barrak M.0 tPreventive veterinary medicine.g2011 May 1, v. 99, no. 2-4 p.193-200dElsevier B.V.x0167-58777nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.prevetmed.2011.01.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03321naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003900113040001800152100002200170245011400192300001600306520138700322592002801709650002301737650001201760650002101772650001501793650001501808650002201823650002101845650001501866650001401881650001101895650001301906650000701919650002101926650001601947650003701963650001502000650002902015650002402044650003102068650003102099650001302130650003302143650003202176653002102208653001502229653003102244653001902275700002502294700002402319700002402343700002102367700001802388700002402406700002202430700002102452773010402473856008502577852000902662655001202671IND60113347220221119094400.0160903e20131130xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011334722DNAL7 a240765172pmid7 a10.1016/j.jenvman.2013.09.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aProla, Lizie D.T.10aAdsorption of Direct Blue 53 dye from aqueous solutions by multi-walled carbon nanotubes and activated carbon  ap. 166-175.  aMulti-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT) and powder activated carbon (PAC) were used as adsorbents for adsorption of Direct Blue 53 dye (DB-53) from aqueous solutions. The adsorbents were characterised using Raman spectroscopy, N2 adsorption/desorption isotherms, and scanning and transmission electron microscopy. The effects of initial pH, contact time and temperature on adsorption capacity of the adsorbents were investigated. At pH 2.0, optimum adsorption of the dye was achieved by both adsorbents. Equilibrium contact times of 3 and 4 h were achieved by MWCNT and PAC adsorbents, respectively. The general order kinetic model provided the best fit of the experimental data compared to pseudo-first order and pseudo-second order kinetic adsorption models. For DB-53 dye, the equilibrium data (298–323 K) were best fitted to the Sips isotherm model. The maximum sorption capacity for adsorption of the dye occurred at 323 K, with the values of 409.4 and 135.2 mg g−1 for MWCNT and PAC, respectively. Studies of adsorption/desorption were conducted and the results showed that DB-53 loaded MWCNT could be regenerated (97.85%) using a mixture 50% acetone + 50% of 3 mol L−1 NaOH. Simulated dye house effluents were used to evaluate the application of the adsorbents for effluent treatment (removal of 99.87% and 97.00% for MWCNT and PAC, respectively, were recorded).  aPublisher supplied data 3aRaman spectroscopy 3aacetone 3aactivated carbon 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3aaqueous solutions 3acarbon nanotubes 3adesorption 3aeffluents 3amodels 3anitrogen 3apH 3asodium hydroxide 3atemperature 3atransmission electron microscopy 2aAdsorption 2aAzo Compoundsxchemistry 2aCharcoalxchemistry 2aColoring Agentsxchemistry 2aHydrogen-Ion Concentration 2aKinetics 2aNanotubes, Carbonxchemistry 2aWater Purificationxmethods 0aCarbon nanotubes 0aAdsorption 0aNonlinear isotherm fitting 0aDirect Blue 531 aMachado, Fernando M.1 aBergmann, Carlos P.1 ade Souza, Felipe E.1 aGally, Caline R.1 aLima, Eder C.1 aAdebayo, Matthew A.1 aDias, Silvio L.P.1 aCalvete, Tatiana0 tJournal of environmental management.g2013 Nov. 30, v. 130 p.166-175dElsevier Ltdx0301-47977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2013.09.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03740naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245017800167500001900345520221500364592002802579650002102607650003302628650002802661650003402689650002102723650001902744650001902763650001702782650001502799650001202814650002402826650001302850653002502863653001602888653001202904653003402916700005902950700001803009700005903027773011403086856008503200852000903285655001203294IND60712990820221119203450.0201104e20201108xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071299082DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chroma.2020.4615672doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSaylor, Kyle10aMulti-epitope insert modulates solubility-based and chromatographic purification of human papilloma virus 16 L1-based vaccine without inhibiting virus-like particle assembly  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe separation of heterogeneous protein mixtures has always been characterized by a trade-off between purity and yield. One way this issue has been addressed in the past is by recombinantly modifying protein to improve separations. Such modifications are mostly employed in the form of tags used specifically for affinity chromatography, though it is also possible to make changes to a protein that will have a sizeable impact on its hydrophobicity and charge/charge distribution. As such, it should also be possible to use protein tags to modulate phase separations and protein-resin binding kinetics when performing ion exchange chromatography. Here, we employed a three-step purification scheme on E. coli expressed, His-tagged, human papilloma virus 16 L1-based recombinant proteins (rHPV 16 L1) that consisted of an inclusion body (IB) wash step, a diethylaminoethyl (DEAE) anion exchange chromatography (AEX) step, and an immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC) polishing step. Purification of the wild type rHPV 16 L1 protein (WT) was characterized by substantial losses during the IB wash but relatively high yield over the DEAE column. In contrast, purification of modified rHPV 16 L1, a chimeric version of the WT protein that had the last 34 amino acids replaced with an MHC class II multi-epitope insert derived from tetanus toxin and diphtheria toxin (WTΔC34-2TEp), was characterized by little to no losses in the IB wash but had a relatively low yield over the DEAE column. Since the fate of these proteins was to be used in vaccine formulations, it is important to note that the modifications made to the WTΔC34-2TEp protein had little to no effect on its ability to assemble into virus-like particles (VLPs). These results demonstrate that modifications of the WT protein via the recombinant insertion of immunofunctional polypeptides can modulate both phase-based separation and charge-based chromatographic processes. Additionally, incorporation of the specific, multi-epitope tag used in this study may prove to be beneficial in recombinant HPV vaccine development due to its potential to improve phase separation yield and vaccine immunogenicity without inhibiting VLP formation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aHuman papillomavirus type 16 3aaffinity chromatography 3aanion exchange chromatography 3adiphtheria toxin 3ahydrophobicity 3aimmunogenicity 3apolypeptides 3aseparation 3atetanus 3avaccine development 3avaccines 0aProtein purification 0aProtein tag 0aVaccine 0aLiquid-solid phase separation1 aWaldman, Alison1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3902-06371 aGillam, Frank1 aZhang, Chenming1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6770-53340 tJournal of chromatography.g2020 Nov. 08, v. 1631 p.461567-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl50504x0021-96737nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chroma.2020.4615673Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04292naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001800153245011400171300001600285520266800301592002802969650001302997650001203010650001903022650001103041650001503052650001903067650001703086650001603103650001303119650002403132650002303156650001303179650001403192650002003206650001603226650001203242651001003254653001203264653002703276653002303303653002003326653002503346653002103371700002303392700006003415700001903475700002503494700002203519773010003541856008803641852000903729655001203738IND60585459520221120123343.0180914e201712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058545952DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apgeochem.2017.10.0242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMorelli, Guia10aExperimental simulation of arsenic desorption from Quaternary aquifer sediments following sea water intrusion  ap. 176-187.  aAlluvial sediments from the coastal area in southern Tuscany (Italy) characterized by a significant As anomaly (As >500 mg/kg) are subjected to seawater intrusion due to groundwater exploitation. Sequential extractions and kinetic experiments were carried out on Quaternary alluvial sediments to quantify the interaction between As oxianions (adsorbed on mineral surfaces) and Cl⁻ in solutions and to establish if this mechanism may contribute to the release of As in groundwater.The natural water-rock interaction in the aquifer was simulated in two experiments by saturating the samples with four solutions with increasing chlorinity for different time.Firstly, a rapid change in the aquifer salinity (e.g. fast seawater intrusion, groundwater over pumping) was simulated by an interaction sediment/solution of 24 h. Solutions with Cl⁻≤2000 mg/L extracted up to 76 μg/kg of As, while seawater (Sol 4(24): Cl⁻ ∼18,500 mg/L) extracted up to 161 μg/kg of As.In a second experiment, the ingression of water with increasing salinity in the acquifer, followed by the withdrawal of the water after progressively longer interaction times with the aquifer sediments, was simulated. The timing of the As-Cl reaction was constrained by saturating the samples with four solutions with increasing salinity (Sol1(84): Cl⁻∼0 mg/L; Sol2(84) Cl⁻ = 250 mg/L; Sol3(84) Cl⁻ = 2000 mg/L; Sol4(84): Cl⁻ = 15,886 mg/L) that interacted with the sediment samples for longer saturation times (up to 21 days for each solution). After saturation with the previous three solutions up to 62 μg/kg of As were extracted by seawater, following a salinity increase from 2000 mg/L Cl to a chlorinity close to seawater, representing ∼60% of the exchangable As fraction in the sediments.Our results constrained the timing of sediment/solution interaction of As desorption and showed that after a rapid intrusion of seawater or after a relatively long period of interaction with saline solutions an aquifer with similar geology releases in groundwater concentrations of As exeeding the 10 μg/L limit for drinking water. Also, this study estimated the potential effects caused by the ingression of seawater in lowland alluvial coastal areas induced by groundwaters exploitation or by extreme weather events. Such information is crucial for management authorities to mitigate and predict the effects of As hazard in groundwater driven by changes in the environmental aquifer conditions (e.g. seasonal fluctuations of the water table and/or changes in salinity of coastal aquifers), which are becoming increasingly frequent as consequence of climate change.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaquifers 3aarsenic 3aclimate change 3acoasts 3adesorption 3adrinking water 3ageochemistry 3agroundwater 3asalinity 3asaltwater intrusion 3aseasonal variation 3aseawater 3asediments 3asodium chloride 3awater table 3aweather 3aItaly 0aArsenic 0aDesorption experiments 0aSeawater intrusion 0aCoastal aquifer 0aQuaternary sediments 0aSouthern Tuscany1 aRimondi, Valentina1 aBenvenuti, Marco1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1344-84211 aMedas, Daniela1 aCostagliola, Pilario1 aGasparon, Massimo0 tApplied geochemistry.g2017 Dec., v. 87 p.176-187dElsevier LtdwJournal:11912x0883-29277nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apgeochem.2017.10.0243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02629naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002000152245016100172500002200333520103600355592002801391650001801419650002001437650002401457650001901481650001801500650001301518650001401531650001701545650001001562650002001572650001701592650001101609653002701620653001601647653001101663653001901674653001901693653001601712653001801728653000801746700002001754700002101774700002001795700001901815700002201834700001901856700002101875773009501896856008701991852000902078655001202087IND60793919920221121025535.0220926e20220916xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079391992DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2022.1343382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCecchi, Lorenzo10aIndustrial drying for agrifood by-products re-use: cases studies on pomegranate peel (Punica granatum L.) and stoned olive pomace (pâtè, Olea europaea L.)  aPre-press version  aThe effect of industrial drying processes on phenols and polysaccharides of olive pomace (pâté) and pomegranate peel was studied, with the aim to re-use pomegranate and olive oil by-products. Pomegranate peel (Wonderful and G1 varieties) was oven-dried at different temperatures, taking into account peel thickness and size. Pâté was freeze-dried and oven dried at 50-110 °C, at lab scale; then, an industrial drying system (150 °C) was compared to freeze-drying. All dried samples were analyzed in terms of phenolic and polysaccharides compounds. Drying at room temperature of small pieces of pomegranate peel guaranteed the highest humidity removal and recovery of phenols. Sugar analysis, DLS and ¹H-NMR confirmed that polysaccharide fractions were not significantly affected by the highest drying temperatures (42 °C for pomegranate, 150 °C for pâté). The two drying procedures at large scale were suitable for avoiding degradation of phenols, maintaining the same profiles of the corresponding freeze-dried samples.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOlea europaea 3aPunica granatum 3aambient temperature 3afood chemistry 3afreeze drying 3ahumidity 3aolive oil 3aolive pomace 3aovens 3apolysaccharides 3apomegranates 3asugars 0apectic polysaccharides 0apolyphenols 0a1H-NMR 0ahydroxytyrosol 0alyophilization 0aoven-drying 0aellagitannins 0aDLS1 aKhatib, Mohamad1 aBellumori, Maria1 aCiva, Valentina1 aDomizio, Paola1 aInnocenti, Marzia1 aBalli, Diletta1 aMulinacci, Nadia0 tFood chemistry.g2022 Sept. 16,  p.134338-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8139x0308-81467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2022.1343383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02335naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002100143245005000164300001600214520139800230592002801628650001501656650001301671650002201684650001601706650002901722650002201751650001301773700001901786773012801805856007901933852000902012655001202021IND60480682620221122051944.0160706e20060101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6048068262DNAL7 a10.3138/jvme.33.3.3172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSteinert, Yvonne10aFaculty Development: Principles and Practices  ap. 317-324.  aInstructors in the health professions today must acquire knowledge and competencies that go beyond disciplinary expertise. It is now generally accepted that educational training as a teacher is essential to a faculty member's effectiveness as an educator. The educational challenges across the health professions share many similarities. In this article, we draw on the medical education literature and focus on faculty development designed to enhance teaching effectiveness. We first address commonly included faculty development topics, including instructional improvement, organizational development, the development of professional academic skills, and the teaching of specific content areas. We then review a variety of educational approaches and formats that are described in the literature. Included in this discussion are commonly used workshops, seminars, short courses, and fellowships, as well as longitudinal programs, peer coaching, mentorship, self-directed learning, and computer-aided instruction. We also briefly explore learning at work and in communities of practice, and we discuss several frequently encountered challenges in designing and implementing faculty development activities, including motivating colleagues and assessing program effectiveness. We conclude the discussion by presenting a set of guidelines for the design of effective faculty development programs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aguidelines 3alearning 3amedical education 3aoccupations 3aprofessional development 3ateacher education 3ateachers1 aMann, Karen V.0 tJournal of veterinary medical education.g2006 Jan. 1, v. 33, no. 3 p.317-324dUniversity of Toronto Pressx0748-321X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3138%2Fjvme.33.3.3173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02913naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001700144245013000161300002000291520119000311592002801501596009801529596009801627596009401725650001101819650001101830650001201841650001401853650001201867653002101879653002301900653003301923653002601956700001601982700001501998700001702013700001502030700001402045700005602059700005302115700005702168773014202225856007902367852000902446655001202455IND60772674920221118031557.0220407e20220322xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077267492DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.2c024662doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBian, Cancan10aMg₂SiO₄/Si-Coated Disproportionated SiO Composite Anodes with High Initial Coulombic Efficiency for Lithium Ion Batteries  ap. 15337-15345.  aSilicon monoxide (SiO) is considered as one of the most promising anode material candidates for next-generation high-energy-density lithium ion batteries (LIBs) due to its high specific capacity and relatively lower volume expansion than that of Si. However, a large number of irreversible products are formed during the first charging and discharging process, resulting in a low initial Coulombic efficiency (ICE) of SiO. Herein, we report an economical and convenient method to increase the ICE of SiO without sacrificing its specific capacity by a solid reaction between magnesium silicide (Mg₂Si) and micron-sized SiO. The reaction product (named MSO) exhibits a unique core–shell structure with uniformly distributed Mg₂SiO₄ and Si as the shell and disproportionated SiO as the core. MSO exhibits a superior ICE and a high reversible capacity of 81.7% and 1306.1 mAh g–¹, respectively, which can be further increased to 88.7% and 1446.4 mAh g–¹ after carbon coating, and improved cyclic stability compared to bare SiO. This work provides a simple yet effective strategy to address the low ICE issue of SiO anode materials to promote the practical application of SiO.  aPublisher supplied data  a51872305cNational Natural Science Foundation of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001809  a52002381cNational Natural Science Foundation of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001809  a2019M662125cChina Postdoctoral Science Foundationdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100002858 3aanodes 3acarbon 3alithium 3amagnesium 3asilicon 0asilicon monoxide 0amagnesium silicide 0ainitial coulombic efficiency 0alithium ion batteries1 aFu, Rusheng1 aShi, Zhepu1 aJi, Jingjing1 aZhang, Jun1 aChen, Wen1 aZhou, Xufeng1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3153-69541 aShi, Siqi1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8988-97631 aLiu, Zhaoping1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3943-89530 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2022 Mar. 22, v. 14, no. 13 p.15337-15345dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.2c024663Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02609naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002000143245007500163300001600238520136400254592002801618650002001646650001101666650002601677650004301703650002901746650001501775650001401790650000701804650001701811650001301828650002701841653003001868653001001898653001101908653002901919653000901948700003101957773011301988856007702101852000902178655001202187IND60516464420221117031928.0160325e20151124xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051646442DNAL7 a10.1139/cjm-2015-05562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMondal, Moumita10aRole of Vibrio cholerae exochitinase ChiA2 in horizontal gene transfer  ap. 201-209.  aVibrio cholerae exochitinase ChiA2 plays a key role in acquisition of nutrients by chitin hydrolysis in the natural environment as well as in pathogenesis in the intestinal milieu. In this study we demonstrate the importance of ChiA2 in horizontal gene transfer in the natural environment. We found that the expression of ChiA2 and TfoX, the central regulator of V.cholerae horizontal gene transfer, varied with changes in environmental conditions. The activity of ChiA2 was also dependent on these conditions. In 3 different environmental conditions tested here, we observed that the supporting environmental condition for maximum expression and activity of ChiA2 was 20 °C, pH 5.5, and 100 mmol/L salinity in the presence of chitin. The same condition also induced TfoX expression and was favorable for horizontal gene transfer in V.cholerae. High-performance liquid chromatography analysis showed that ChiA2 released a significant amount of (GlcNAc)₂ from chitin hydrolysis under the favorable condition. We hypothesized that under the favorable environmental condition, ChiA2 was upregulated and maximally active to produce a significant amount of (GlcNAc)₂ from chitin. The same environmental condition also induced tfoX expression, followed by its translational activation by the (GlcNAc)₂ produced, leading to efficient horizontal gene transfer.  aPublisher supplied data 3aVibrio cholerae 3achitin 3aenvironmental factors 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3ahorizontal gene transfer 3ahydrolysis 3anutrients 3apH 3apathogenesis 3asalinity 3atranslation (genetics) 0aVibrio cholerae chitinase 0aChiA2 0achitin 0ahorizontal gene transfer 0atfoX1 aChatterjee, Nabendu Sekhar0 tCanadian journal of microbiology.g2015 Nov. 24, v. 62, no. 3 p.201-209dNRC Research Pressx1480-32757nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjm-2015-05563Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02346naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002000155245005100175300001600226520123500242592002801477650001101505650000901516650002901525650001101554650001201565650001201577650001301589651001401602653002001616653001701636653001201653653001401665700001801679700001301697700001501710700001601725773009701741856008901838852000901927655001201936IND60602098920221120133145.0180709e201501  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060209892DNAL7 a10.1016/j.actatropica.2013.06.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSatrija, Fadjar10aCurrent status of schistosomiasis in Indonesia  ap. 349-353.  aSchistosomiasis japonica is currently endemic in three very isolated areas in Central Sulawesi Province, Indonesia. Integrated schistosomiasis control programmes implemented in the Lindu and Napu Valleys during the period of 1982–2005 have successfully reduced the prevalence of schistosomiasis from 37% to 1% in Napu Valley and from 37% to 0.6% in Lindu Valley. Human prevalence surveys reveal that the prevalence tended to increase during the period of 2008–2011. The average prevalence fluctuated between 0.3% and 4.8% in Napu Valley and between 0.8% and 3.2% in Lindu Valley. During this period, the percentage of rats that were infected fluctuated between 7.9% and 18.2% in Napu Valley and between 6.7% and 9.8% in Lindu Valley. The average percentage of infected snails was 2.6% and 2.1% in the Napu and Lindu Valleys, respectively. In 2008, schistosomiasis was also found in a separate but adjacent place, i.e. Bada Valley. The prevalence of schistosomiasis in endemic villages in this area was 0.8% in 2008 and 5.9% in 2010, while the percentage of infected snails was 1% in 2010. These contemporary data clearly indicate a trend of increasing schistosomiasis prevalence in the three endemic areas in Central Sulawesi.  aPublisher supplied data 3ahumans 3arats 3aschistosomiasis japonica 3asnails 3asurveys 3avalleys 3avillages 3aIndonesia 0aSchistosomiasis 0aEpidemiology 0aControl 0aIndonesia1 aRidwan, Yusuf1 aJastal, 1 aSamarang, 1 aRauf, Abdul0 tActa tropica.g2015 Jan., v. 141 p.349-353dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl44799x0001-706X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.actatropica.2013.06.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03760naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100005500144245017300199300002000372520160000392592002801992596009802020596012802118596007602246596011002322596005402432596005302486650001602539650001502555650001402570650001602584650003402600650001402634650001302648650001902661650003102680653001602711653003102727653003002758653002802788653001702816653003502833700005702868700005802925700001402983700001502997773014203012856007903154852000903233655001203242IND60772675020221118031659.0220407e20220324xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077267502DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.2c024912doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPei, Haoran1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8455-357110aCombining Solid-State Shear Milling and FFF 3D-Printing Strategy to Fabricate High-Performance Biomimetic Wearable Fish-Scale PVDF-Based Piezoelectric Energy Harvesters  ap. 15346-15359.  aHigh-performance flexible piezoelectric polymer–ceramic composites are in high demand for increasing wearable energy-harvesting applications. In this work, a strategy combining solid-state shear milling (S³M) and fused filament fabrication (FFF) 3D-printing technology is proposed for the fabrication of high-performance biomimetic wearable piezoelectric poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF)/tetraphenylphosphonium chloride (TPPC)/barium titanate (BaTiO₃) nanocomposite energy harvesters with a biomimetic fish-scale-like metamaterial. The S³M technology could greatly improve the dispersion of BaTiO₃ sub-micrometer particles and the interfacial compatibility, resulting in better processability and piezoelectric performance of the nanocomposites. Typically, the FFF 3D printed energy harvester incorporating 30 wt % BaTiO₃ showed the highest piezoelectric outputs with an open-circuit voltage of 11.5 V and a short-circuit current of 220 nA. It could hence drive nine green LEDs to work normally. In addition, a 3D-printed biomimetic wearable energy harvester inspired by an environmentally adaptive fish-scale-like metamaterial was further fabricated. The fish-scale-like energy harvester could harvest energy through different deformation motions and successfully recharge a 4.7 μF capacitor by being mounted on a bicycle tire and the tire’s rolling. This work not only provides a 3D printing strategy for designing diversified and complex geometric structures but also paves the way for further applications in flexible, wearable, self-powered electromechanical energy harvesters.  aPublisher supplied data  a51933007cNational Natural Science Foundation of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001809  a2017YFE0111500cMinistry of Science and Technology of the People's Republic of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100002855  a2020SCUNG203cSichuan Universitydhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100004912  a2021-GH03-00009-HZcInternational Science & Technology Cooperation Project of Chengdudhttps://doi.org/NA  a2021YFH0088cSichuan Provincedhttps://doi.org/NA  a22CXTD0019cSichuan Provincedhttps://doi.org/NA 3abiomimetics 3acapacitors 3achlorides 3adeformation 3aelectric potential difference 3afluorides 3ageometry 3ananocomposites 3athree-dimensional printing 0a3D printing 0afused filament fabrication 0asolid-state shear milling 0abiomimetic and wearable 0ametamaterial 0apiezoelectric energy harvester1 aShi, Shaohong1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4471-58121 aChen, Yinghong1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2169-46731 aXiong, Yu1 aLv, Qinniu0 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2022 Mar. 24, v. 14, no. 13 p.15346-15359dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.2c024913Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03655naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003100111040001800142100001500160245011500175300001800290520201500308592002802323650001102351650001202362650002402374650001502398650000902413650001102422650001402433650001302447650000902460650001302469650001502482650003102497650001302528650004702541650001202588650005102600650002302651650002102674650002402695650001102719650004502730650004102775650003202816650002102848650004202869700001702911773009902928856007703027852000903104655001203113IND4450840920221120074109.0141101e201103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445084092DNAL7 a213388112pmid7 a10.3168/jds.2010-36822doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLean, I.J.10aEffect of feeding biotin on milk production and hoof health in lactating dairy cows: A quantitative assessment  ap. 1465-1476.  aObjectives of this study were to critically review randomized controlled trials, evaluate the effectiveness of supplementation with biotin on milk yield and composition and hoof health in lactating dairy cows, explore sources of heterogeneity among studies, and evaluate publication bias. Quantitative assessments can increase the statistical power with which we study the effect of treatments, such as biotin, on outcomes. A total of 9 papers, with 6 production and 3 hoof health studies, met the eligibility criteria for meta-analysis. Eight studies evaluated various hoof lesions in biotin-supplemented cows that did not meet the inclusion criteria. Eleven comparisons were made of milk production responses to biotin treatment. Data extracted included the number of cows in control and treatment groups, measures of variance of responses (standard error or standard deviation) and P-values. Other data obtained included the duration of treatment before and after calving, parity, breed of cow, type and dose of biotin, delivery method of supplementation, and types of diets. Biotin increased milk production by 1.29kg per head per day (95% confidence interval=0.35 to 2.18kg) with no evidence of heterogeneity (I²=0.0%). Treatment did not affect milk fat or protein percentages, and a trend to increase fat and protein yields was observed. Milk production and composition results were not influenced by duration of treatment before calving, parity, or diet type. Assessment of biotin supplementation on hoof health indicated that more studies had improved rather than negative or neutral outcomes. The effect of biotin treatment on milk production was relatively large and the effects on fat and protein yields, although not significant, were consistent in direction and magnitude with the milk response. The hoof health responses to biotin should encourage further studies to more effectively define the nature of these responses using consistent criteria for examination of hoof conditions and lameness.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiotin 3acalving 3aconfidence interval 3adairy cows 3adiet 3ahooves 3alactation 3alameness 3amilk 3amilk fat 3amilk yield 3arandomized clinical trials 3avariance 2aAnimal Nutritional Physiological Phenomena 2aAnimals 2aBiotinxadministration & dosagexpharmacology. 2aCattlexphysiology 2aDietxveterinary 2aDietary Supplements 2aFemale 2aHoof and Clawxdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aLactationxdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aMilkxchemistryxsecretion. 2aPublication Bias 2aRandomized Controlled Trials as Topic1 aRabiee, A.R.0 tJournal of dairy science.g2011 Mar., v. 94, no. 3 p.1465-1476dElsevier Inc.x0022-03027nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3168/jds.2010-36823Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02618naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100002800141245012700169500001400296520138300310592002801693650001601721650001401737650001501751650001401766650001801780650002601798650003301824650002001857650002001877650001801897650001001915700001901925700003201944700002201976700001801998773012002016856007502136852000902211655001202220IND60729177320221122025911.0210228e20210210xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072917732DNAL7 a10.3390/ani110204732doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRidlo, Muhammad  Rosyid10aAdiponectin Improves In Vitro Development of Cloned Porcine Embryos by Reducing Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress and Apoptosis  aNAL-light  aThe main factor of embryonic demise is endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. Successful attenuation of ER stress results in an improvement in embryo development. We studied the impact of adiponectin in the in vitro culture (IVC) of porcine embryos derived from parthenogenetic activation and somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT). The first experiment revealed that 15 and 30 μg/mL adiponectin treatments improved cleavage, blastocyst rates, and total cell number (TCN) of parthenogenetic embryos and reduced the expression of XBP1 compared to the 5 μg/mL adiponectin treatment and control groups (p < 0.05). The second experiment showed that cleavage rate, blastocyst formation rate, and TCN of blastocysts were improved in the 15 μg/mL adiponectin treatment group compared with the control group, with significantly reduced XBP1 expression in ≥4-cell stage SCNT embryos and blastocysts (p < 0.05). Treatment with 15 μg/mL adiponectin significantly improved the expression of XBP1 and reduced the expression of ER stress-related genes (uXBP1, sXBP1, PTPN1, and ATF4), increased the expression levels of pluripotency-related genes (Nanog and SOX2), and decreased apoptosis-related gene expression (Caspase-3). These results suggest that 15 μg/mL adiponectin enhanced the in vitro developmental capacity of early-stage SCNT porcine embryos by reducing ER stress and apoptosis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadiponectin 3aapoptosis 3ablastocyst 3acaspase-3 3aembryogenesis 3aendoplasmic reticulum 3aendoplasmic reticulum stress 3agene expression 3aparthenogenesis 3asomatic cells 3aswine1 aKim, Eui  Hyun1 aTaweechaipaisankul, Anukul 1 aLee, Byeong  Chun1 aKim, Geon  A.0 tAnimals.g2021 Feb. 10, v. 11, no. 2dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2274x2076-26157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ani110204733Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02688naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100006700152245013500219520108100354592002801435650003401463650002201497650002501519650001801544650001301562650001001575650002201585650002001607650001801627650002201645650001301667650001301680650001101693650000701704650002401711650002001735650001501755650002401770650001701794650002301811650001601834650001601850650002501866653001001891653001201901653002701913700002201940773010001962856008702062852000902149655001202158IND60697858020221119213714.0200619e20201101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069785802DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2020.1272132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMuley, Abhijeet Bhimrao1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3538-456110aExtension of postharvest shelf life of strawberries (Fragaria ananassa) using a coating of chitosan-whey protein isolate conjugate  aChitosan and whey protein isolate (WPI) conjugate films were prepared as a novel matrix for encapsulating and extending the postharvest shelf life of strawberries. Film forming solutions of chitosan, WPI, and chitosan-WPI conjugate were mixed with glycerol, casted for films at 60 ± 2 °C and assessed for their colour, water vapour and oxygen transfer rate, textural, functional groups and secondary structure, thermal, crystallinity, and antioxidant properties.

Therefore, it is necessary to develop a fast and specific detection method. The specificity of our newly developed quantitative real-time PCR (qRT–PCR) was validated with DNA from 46 strains. Among them, 12 C.sakazakii strains were correctly amplified, whereas no positive florescent signal was observed from 34 nontarget controls. The detection limit of C.sakazakii was about 110 CFU/mL in broth and 1100 CFU/g in PIF. After enrichment in buffered peptone water for 6 h, our developed qRT–PCR assay could reliably detect C.sakazakii when the inoculation level was as low as 2 CFU/25 g (0.08 CFU/g) in PIF. The growth of C.sakazakii could be inhibited by the presence of Lactobacillus pentosus and Bacillus cereus, which used a longer enrichment period before the isolation was accomplished. However, at 5 and 50 CFU/25 g inoculation levels of C.sakazakii in the presence of 4 × 10⁶ CFU L.pentosus/25 g or of 2 × 10⁴ CFU B.cereus/25 g, the qRT–PCR assay could detect the presence of Cronobacter even though these artificially spiked samples were negative in culture. Therefore, our results indicated that the qRT–PCR assay could detect samples containing inhibitors and could avoid false negatives by using an internal amplification control.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillus cereus 3aCronobacter sakazakii 3aDNA 3aLactobacillus pentosus 3adetection limit 3agenes 3ainfant formulas 3apeptones 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3arapid methods 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3avirulent strains 0aCronobacter sakazakii 0acgcA 0aqRT–PCR 0aPIF 0arapid detection1 aYu, Yigang1 aLi, Rong1 aWu, Xinwei1 aXiao, Xinglong1 aWu, Hui0 tCanadian journal of microbiology.g2015 Nov. 24, v. 62, no. 3 p.191-200dNRC Research PresswJournal:jnl44722x0008-41667nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjm-2015-06023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03191naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094024002200121024001900143040001800162100002200180245016600202300001800368506007600386520170400462592002802166506003702194650003502231650003002266650002902296650001602325650002302341650002102364650002602385700002302411700002902434700001602463700001902479700001402498700001502512700001702527700001402544773010302558856007502661852000902736655001202745IND60531882220221207062539.0160726e20141111xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053188222DNAL7 a10.1021/bi501121e2doi7 aPMC42303242pmcid7 a252998012pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCoughlin, Jane M.10aBlmB and TlmB Provide Resistance to the Bleomycin Family of Antitumor Antibiotics by N-Acetylating Metal-Free Bleomycin, Tallysomycin, Phleomycin, and Zorbamycin  ap. 6901-6909.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe bleomycin (BLM) family of glycopeptide-derived antitumor antibiotics consists of BLMs, tallysomycins (TLMs), phleomycins (PLMs), and zorbamycin (ZBM). The self-resistant elements BlmB and TlmB, discovered from the BLM- and TLM-producing organisms Streptomyces verticillus ATCC15003 and Streptoalloteichus hindustanus E465-94 ATCC31158, respectively, are N-acetyltransferases that provide resistance to the producers by disrupting the metal-binding domain of the antibiotics required for activity. Although each member of the BLM family of antibiotics possesses a conserved metal-binding domain, the structural differences between each member, namely, the bithiazole moiety and C-terminal amine of BLMs, have been suggested to instill substrate specificity within BlmB. Here we report that BlmB and TlmB readily accept and acetylate BLMs, TLMs, PLMs, and ZBM in vitro but only in the metal-free forms. Kinetic analysis of BlmB and TlmB reveals there is no strong preference or rate enhancement for specific substrates, indicating that the structural differences between each member of the BLM family play a negligible role in substrate recognition, binding, or catalysis. Intriguingly, the zbm gene cluster from Streptomyces flavoviridis ATCC21892 does not contain an N-acetyltransferase, yet ZBM is readily acetylated by BlmB and TlmB. We subsequently established that S. flavoviridis lacks the homologue of BlmB and TlmB, and ZbmA, the ZBM-binding protein, alone is sufficient to provide ZBM resistance. We further confirmed that BlmB can indeed confer resistance to ZBM in vivo in S. flavoviridis, introduction of which into wild-type S. flavoviridis further increases the level of resistance.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aStreptoalloteichus hindustanus 3aStreptomyces flavoviridis 3aStreptomyces verticillus 3aantibiotics 3acatalytic activity 3amultigene family 3asubstrate specificity1 aRudolf, Jeffrey

RNAS⁺ now provides advice on regional strategies regularly and contributes to the mobilization of resources with respect to multi-country projects on several parasitic diseases in Southeast Asia, primarily schistosomiasis but also other helminth infections including polyparasitism. To make progress towards these goals, RNAS⁺ has focused on platform design and technical standardization aiming at fostering research capacity and the development of networking capacities with easy access to information databases. This administrative body is largely virtual connecting RNAS⁺ members via the Internet, providing database and administrative back-up. This strategy, aiming at boosting research on the target diseases, strongly emphasizes ways and means to alleviate the spectre of disease and poverty from the endemic areas.  aPublisher supplied data 3aInternet 3adatabases 3ahelminths 3ainformation exchange 3amodels 3apoverty 3aschistosomiasis 3azoonoses 3aSouth East Asia 0aSchistosomiasis 0aHelminth Zoonoses 0aRegional Network 0aRNAS+ 0aNeglected tropical diseases 0aSoutheast Asia1 aOlveda, Remigio1 aSripa, Banchob1 aYang, Guo-Jing1 aLeonardo, Lydia1 aBergquist, Robert0 tActa tropica.g2015 Jan., v. 141 p.146-149dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl44799x0001-706X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.actatropica.2013.06.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03544naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003900113040001800152100001700170245013900187300001600326520169000342592002802032650001502060650001402075650001002089650002202099650001102121650004002132650001802172650001602190650002902206650002702235650001402262650002102276650001802297650001502315650003802330650002102368650001002389650002102399650003002420650002002450650001802470653002502488653001802513653002302531653002202554653003902576653004502615653002002660653002502680700002002705700001902725773010402744856008502848852000902933655001202942IND60113347820221119094320.0160903e20131130xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011334782DNAL7 a240803302pmid7 a10.1016/j.jenvman.2013.09.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPérez, G.L.10aOptical properties of highly turbid shallow lakes with contrasting turbidity origins: The ecological and water management implications  ap. 207-220.  aA comprehensive optical study of three highly turbid shallow lakes was presented. The lakes contained very high concentrations of optically active substances [OASs] with clear differences in total suspended solid [TSS] composition among them. Lakes presented elevated values of total absorption [at(λ)] and scattering coefficients [b(λ)], which translated into extremely high light attenuation coefficients [Kd(PAR)]. Differences among lakes in the estimation of Kd(PAR), using two typical estimators of light penetration (i.e., nephelometric turbidity [Tn] and Secchi disk [ZSD]), were analysed. Kirk's optical model was used to model Kd(PAR) using inherent optical properties [IOPs]. Modelled values of Kd(PAR) agreed very well with those measured (R2 = 0.95). In addition, optical properties and Kirk's model were used to determine water quality targets for restoring submerged aquatic vegetation [SAV]. Based on a minimum light requirement for SAV of 10%, results showed that only an integrative remediation action, considering substantial reduction of TSS and Chl a (95%), and CDOM (50%), must be contemplated to improve maximum colonization depth for SAV to values higher than 0.7 m. On the other hand, phytoplankton absorptive characteristics were also studied. In these lakes, phytoplankton showed different responses to the nature of light competition. Some of the variation in specific phytoplankton absorption [aph∗(λ)] was explained by differences in the ratio between unpigmented particulate absorption and phytoplankton absorption (up to R2 = 0.48 for the blue band). Hydrologic optical results were discussed in terms of ecological and management implications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3ahydrology 3alakes 3alight requirement 3amodels 3aphotosynthetically active radiation 3aphytoplankton 3aremediation 3asubmerged aquatic plants 3atotal suspended solids 3aturbidity 3awater management 3awater quality 2aAbsorption 2aConservation of Natural Resources 2aLakesxchemistry 2aLight 2aModels, Chemical 2aPhytoplanktonxphysiology 2aWater Movements 2aWater Quality 0aShallow turbid lakes 0aWater quality 0aOptical properties 0aLight penetration 0aMaximum colonization depth for SAV 0aPhytoplankton absorptive characteristics 0aLake management 0aEcological condition1 aLagomarsino, L.1 aZagarese, H.E.0 tJournal of environmental management.g2013 Nov. 30, v. 130 p.207-220dElsevier Ltdx0301-47977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2013.09.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02368naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100001700141245013700158500001400295520117800309592002801487650001901515650001401534650002601548650001601574650002201590650002301612650002101635650002701656650000901683650002201692650002201714651001001736700001401746700001801760773012001778856007501898852000901973655001201982IND60729177620221122025910.0210228e20210210xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072917762DNAL7 a10.3390/ani110204722doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Lina 10aHigh Genetic Diversity of an Invasive Alien Species: Comparison between Fur-Farmed and Feral American Mink (Neovison vison) in China  aNAL-light  aGenetic characteristics play an important role in alien species for achieving high adaptation and rapid evolution in a new environment. The American mink (Neovison vison) is one of the best-known and most widespread invasive species that has successfully invaded the Eurasian mainland over quite a short period, including most parts of northeastern China. However, genetic information on farmed and feral American mink populations introduced in China is completely lacking. In this study, we combined mitochondrial DNA sequences and polymorphic microsatellites to examine the genetic divergence and genetic diversity of farmed and feral American mink populations. Our results suggest that there is admixture of individuals of different genetic characteristics between farmed and feral populations of mink. Furthermore, the genetic diversity of both farmed and feral American mink populations was high, and no bottleneck or population expansion was detected in most of the populations. These findings not only highlight the genetic characteristics of American mink in northeastern China but also contribute to the general understanding of the invasiveness of farmed species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNeovison vison 3aevolution 3afarmed animal species 3afur farming 3agenetic variation 3aintroduced species 3ainvasive species 3amicrosatellite repeats 3amink 3amitochondrial DNA 3apopulation growth 3aChina1 aHua, Yan 1 aWei, Shichao 0 tAnimals.g2021 Feb. 10, v. 11, no. 2dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2274x2076-26157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ani110204723Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03479naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002600153245009600179500002200275520194500297592002802242650001902270650002102289650001502310650001102325650002502336650002902361650001902390650001402409650002602423650001802449650001402467650000902481650001202490650000902502650001702511650001902528650002002547651001302567653002202580653002702602653001902629653001402648653001902662700002402681700001502705700002002720700002002740773008102760856008702841852000902928655001202937IND60585460120221119075025.0171109s2017    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058546012DNAL7 a10.1016/j.resconrec.2017.10.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aʻAlī, Muṣṭafá,10aEmergy based carbon footprinting of household solid waste management scenarios in Pakistan.  aPre-press version  aWaste management is a serious challenge across many resource constrained countries of the world leading to environmental issues such as pollution and high rates of soil occupation, health issues induced by poor hygienic conditions, and financial problems linked to the high costs associated to waste management, which have high impacts on municipal budget. In this study we determined the environmental impact of different waste disposal scenarios in a major city of Pakistan. Existing studies on the subject of waste management in Pakistan fail to account for the environmental burden of waste processing technologies. To counter this, in this paper we used Emergy based accounting procedures to obtain a donor or nature based perspective for environmental footprinting. Three scenarios were considered for the analysis consisting of the current practice of open dumping as Scenario A; sanitary landfilling with composting and material recycling as Scenario B and incineration with composting and recycling as Scenario C.Results were presented in the form of Emergy based input-output tables as well as greenhouse gas emissions as measured in kg CO2 equivalent (kCO2eq/t) per tonne of waste. Scenario A was the worst option due to its high emissions and lack of any useful output. Scenario B was identified as the best alternative as it resulted in similar amount of net emissions as Scenario C but with relatively lower stress on the environment as indicated by the Emergy indicators. In view of the subject city’s resource constraints we recommend inducing waste reduction and minimization practices through public awareness campaigns. Resource contributions from the civic society are also suggested for erecting the necessary waste disposal infrastructure. The results and suggestions presented herein need to be highlighted in a timely manner in order to resolve environmental and public health risks posed by the current practices.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbon footprint 3acomposting 3aemergy 3aenvironmental impact 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3ainfrastructure 3apollution 3aprocessing technology 3apublic health 3arecycling 3arisk 3asociety 3asoil 3asolid wastes 3awaste disposal 3awaste reduction 3aPakistan 0aEmergy accounting 0alife cycle perspective 0agreenhouse gas 0aemissions 0awaste disposal1 aMarvuglia, Antonino1 aGeng, Yong1 aChaudhry, Nawaz1 aKhokhar, Shahid0 tResources, Conservation & Recycling.g2017, dElsevier B.V.x0921-34497nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.resconrec.2017.10.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02703naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002100148245013500169300001400304520130600318592002801624650001601652650001501668650002101683650002201704650001701726650003101743650002201774653003501796653001901831653001701850653001001867653001901877700001901896700001701915700001401932700001401946700001501960700001901975700001701994700001902011773012302030856008302153852000902236655001202245IND60722718020221118124311.0210820e20210415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072271802DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcis.2020.12.0742doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChoi, Hyeonggeun10aElectrochemically active hydroquinone-based redox mediator for flexible energy storage system with improved charge storing ability  ap. 62-69.  aElectrochemically active redox mediators have been widely investigated in energy conversion/storage system to improve overall catalytic activities and energy storing ability by inducing favorable surface redox reactions. However, the enhancement of electrochemical activity from the utilization of redox mediators (RMs) is only confirmed through theoretical computation and laboratory-scale experiment. The use of RMs for practical, wearable, and flexible applications has been scarcely researched. Herein, for the first time, a wearable fiber-based flexible energy storage system (f-FESS) with hydroquinone (HQ) composites as a catalytically active RM is introduced to demonstrate its energy-storing roles. The as-prepared f-FESS-HQ shows the superior electrochemical performance, such as the improved energy storage ability (211.16 F L⁻¹ and 29.3 mWh L⁻¹) and long-term cyclability with a capacitance retention of 95.1% over 5000 cycles. Furthermore, the f-FESS-HQ can well maintain its original electrochemical properties under harsh mechanical stress (bending, knotting, and weaving conditions) as well as humid conditions in water and detergent solutions. Thus, the strategical use of electrochemically active RMs can provide the advanced solution for future wearable energy storage system.  aPublisher supplied data 3acapacitance 3adetergents 3aelectrochemistry 3aenergy conversion 3ahydroquinone 3alaboratory experimentation 3amechanical stress 0aFlexible energy storage system 0aRedox mediator 0aHydroquinone 0aFiber 0aSupercapacitor1 aKim, Min-Cheol1 aPark, Yeonsu1 aLee, Suok1 aAhn, Wook1 aHong, John1 aInn Sohn, Jung1 aJang, A-Rang1 aLee, Young-Woo0 tJournal of colloid and interface science.g2021 Apr. 15, v. 588 p.62-69dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12461x0021-97977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2020.12.0743Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01788naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094024002200121024001900143040001800162100002100180245010500201300001800306506007600324520059400400592002800994506003701022650002101059650002801080650001601108650002201124650003301146650001401179700002101193700002501214773010301239856007501342852000901417655001201426IND60531882420221207062604.0160726e20141111xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053188242DNAL7 a10.1021/bi50123542doi7 aPMC42303292pmcid7 a253434772pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChapman, Alex M.10aCharacterization of the Binding Interaction between the Oncoprotein Gankyrin and a Grafted S6 ATPase  ap. 6857-6859.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aA complex with the C-terminal portion of the proteosomal subunit S6 ATPase is the only available structure of a protein–protein interaction involving the oncoprotein gankyrin.

EP of EPI adhesive decreased after modification with higher concentration of furfuryl alcohol while an improved penetration was recorded for PVAc into furfurylated wood. A deeper penetration was observed for all adhesives into wood treated with lower concentration of furfuryl alcohol. The EP of EPI and PU adhesives reduced after NMM treatment but it increased in the case of PVAc. In spite of reduction of EP of PU after NMM treatment, it represented a deeper penetration among all adhesives possibly due to its lower molecular weight. For Scots pine, increasing the treatment temperature improved EP of all adhesives while for beech, the EP of PU and PVAc increased largely in the case of samples treated at 195 °C. Visual analysis of fluorescence microscopy pictures provided more detailed information on modality of penetration. The results are useful for understanding the interaction among common adhesives and modified materials, and can be used in future research to explain the bonding behavior of modified wood.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFagus 3aPinus sylvestris 3aacetates 3aadhesives 3aemulsions 3afluorescence microscopy 3afurfuryl alcohol 3amolecular weight 3apolyurethanes 3atemperature 3awood1 aAdamopoulos, Stergios1 aMilitz, Holger0 tEuropean journal of wood and wood products.g2015 Sept., v. 73, no. 5 p.635-642dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx0018-37687nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00107-015-0920-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02263naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002400143245004800167300001600215506002800231520110200259592002801361506003701389650001101426650000801437650001501445650002301460650001301483650001901496650001301515650001401528650001701542653001701559653001201576653001201588653002001600700001501620773013101635856007801766852000901844655001201853IND60785123620221207082944.0190401e201902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078512362DNAL7 a10.19159/tutad.4751232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAŞCI, Özlem ÖNAL10aWeed Control in Organic Roughage Production  ap. 115-122.  aResource is Open Access  aIn organic ruminant product system, high quality hay, produced in organic agriculture, is a great need. One of the factors that negatively affect quality of roughage production is weeds. This study was prepared to provide information about the weed control in organic roughage production. Because chemical herbicide use in organic farming is not allowed, there is no chance to use herbicide to control weeds. Therefore, weeds should be suppressed by different methods. As known quality roughage is obtained from meadow-pasture lands and forage crops grown in field. In the forage crops agriculture, first of all, it is necessary to sow to the field free of weeds and to use high quality seed. When forage plants were sown at the field where cereal or hoe plants was grown as previous crop, weeds are less problem. In the perennial species, planting with a companion crop is also effective in weed control. In pasture lands, weeds can be controlled with following grazing management principles and grazing planning. In addition, some pasture improvement methods can be effective in combating weeds.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aforage 3ahay 3aherbicides 3aorganic production 3apastures 3aproduct system 3aroughage 3aruminants 3aweed control 0aForage plant 0apasture 0agrazing 0aorganic farming1 aACAR, Zeki0 tTürkiye tarımsal araştırmalar dergisi.g2019 Feb., v. 6, no. 1 p.115-122dSiirt UniversitywJournal:27812x2528-858X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.19159/tutad.4751233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03169naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001300153245010400166300001600270520164300286592002801929650001401957650001101971650001901982650001102001650002602012650001102038650002902049650001702078650002002095650001502115650002802130650001602158650001702174651001002191653002002201653003302221653002302254653003802277653002202315653001502337700001302352700001502365700001302380700001602393700001802409700001402427773010202441856008702543852000902630655001202639IND60585460320221119074856.0171109e201802  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058546032DNAL7 a10.1016/j.resconrec.2017.10.0202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYe, Hong10aModeling energy-related CO2 emissions from office buildings using general regression neural network  ap. 168-174.  aCarbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from urban office buildings energy usages (BEC) constitute a substantial component of anthropogenic greenhouse gas emission, and are set to rapidly increase with further urbanization. Establishing a concise, accurate, and realistic model that can predict future emissions is challenging but essential for strategies to develop low carbon construction and sustainable development in urban areas. In this paper, the operational energy use for 294 office buildings across China was collected and analyzed. We focus on four main variables, and analyze a further ten second-level variables, to elucidate the role that a building’s occupants, its structural characteristics, and localized natural conditions play in determining energy consumption. Using general regression neural network (GRNN), the factors’ direct and indirect effects on energy consumption were tested. A building’s structural attributes had the most impact on energy-related CO2 emissions, followed by the relevant socioeconomic conditions, the micro-climate, and finally the regional climate. A version of the model that was constructed with interaction between the four main variables was found to be the most precise. GRNN combined with urban development scenarios was used for the prediction of cities’ future CO2 emissions. Economic development and improving standards in the construction industry could have significant impacts on future CO2 emissions. This study provides a detailed method that could be used to explore the dynamics of office energy use and competing options for the construction of low-carbon office buildings.  aPublisher supplied data 3abuildings 3acarbon 3acarbon dioxide 3acities 3aconstruction industry 3aenergy 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3amicroclimate 3aneural networks 3aprediction 3asustainable development 3aurban areas 3aurbanization 3aChina 0aOffice building 0aEnergy usage carbon emission 0aModel construction 0aGeneral regression neural network 0aScenario analysis 0aPrediction1 aRen, Qun1 aHu, Xinyue1 aLin, Tao1 aShi, Longyu1 aZhang, Guoqin1 aLi, Xinhu0 tResources, Conservation & Recycling.g2018 Feb., v. 129 p.168-174dElsevier B.V.x0921-34497nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.resconrec.2017.10.0203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02059naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245012200166300001800288520094900306592002801255650001001283650001501293650001301308650001501321650002201336650002101358650001101379650003001390700002101420700002001441700001901461700001801480773010901498856008101607852000901688655001201697IND60119720420221119013118.0141227e201412  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011972042DNAL7 a10.1134/S10619348141400322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBorisov, R.

Using a series of pharmaceutical substances with various functional groups and synthetic N-heterocyclic compounds, it was shown that the simple application of graphite onto TLC spots (outlining contour of the spots and shading the spots with a pencil lead) ensured the efficient desorption/ionization of analytes. In most of cases, the recorded mass spectra revealed only [M + Na]⁺and [M + K]⁺ion peaks, doublets of which can be used to determine molecular masses. The appearance of [M + H]⁺ion peaks in some mass spectra may be due to the presence of mineral acids in the samples. The described approach to the application of the “matrix” onto analyte spots eliminates the danger of spot blurring by a solution or an organic matrix, simplifies the procedure, and shortens the time of sample preparation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacids 3adesorption 3agraphene 3aionization 3amass spectrometry 3amolecular weight 3asodium 3athin layer chromatography1 aPolovkov, N.

The former process should lead to convergence in community composition with other cold environments, such as those in the Arctic. Alternatively, dispersal limitations should minimise similarity between Antarctica and distant northern landmasses. Using high‐throughput sequencing, we show that Antarctica shares significantly more fungi with the Arctic, and more fungi display a bipolar distribution, than would be expected in the absence of environmental filtering. In contrast to temperate and tropical regions, there is relatively little endemism, and a strongly bimodal distribution of range sizes. Increasing southerly latitude is associated with lower endemism and communities increasingly dominated by fungi with widespread ranges. These results suggest that micro‐organisms with well‐developed dispersal capabilities can inhabit opposite poles of the Earth, and dominate extreme environments over specialised local species.  aPublisher supplied data 3acold zones 3acommunity structure 3afungal communities 3ahigh-throughput nucleotide sequencing 3aindigenous species 3alatitude 3asoil fungi 3atropics 3aAntarctic region 3aAntarctica 3aArctic region1 aNewsham, Kevin K.1 aBol, Roland1 aDungait, Jennifer A.

However, the existing methods in forensic practice to identifying the species of bone and teeth are not objective, accurate or brief enough. We have reported the classification of bone species by Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) and chemometric methods. Here we further use this method to realize the rapid detection of teeth species. 50 teeth samples from human and non-human (bovine, dog, rat, rabbit) were used in this study. Uncontrolled environment conditions were set to simulate real forensic casework. Teeth sample were prepared by grinding powder and pressed into KBr tablet, then the spectral data were collected. Principal component analysis (PCA) and partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) were used in the study. The internal and external validations of PLS-DA results were 97.1% and 93.3% accuracy, respectively. The results illustrate that FT-IR spectroscopy be used as a practical tool to identify species of unknown teeth.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3acattle 3achemometrics 3adiscriminant analysis 3adogs 3aforensic sciences 3ahumans 3aprincipal component analysis 3arabbits 3arapid methods 3arats 3aspecies identification 3aspectral analysis 0aHuman bone identification 0aFT-IR spectroscopy 0aChemometrics1 aYu, Kai1 aWu, Hao1 aShen, Chen1 aLi, Huiyu1 aLiu, Ruina1 aSun, Qinru1 aWang, Zhenyuan0 tForensic science international.g2022 Apr., v. 333 p.111205-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:3523x0379-07387nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.forsciint.2022.1112053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02118naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245014800166300001800314520098400332592002801316650001201344650002501356650002001381650001101401650004101412650001501453650002101468650001201489650002701501700002001528700002101548773010901569856008101678852000901759655001201768IND60119720520221123022914.0141227e201412  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011972052DNAL7 a10.1134/S10619348141401352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYashin, Yu.

It has been shown that, in the case of APPhI, the mass spectra of TMS and TBDMS derivatives contained only peaks corresponding to [M + 73]⁺and [M + 115]⁺(or [M + Si(Me)₃]⁺and [M + Si(ᵗ Bu)(Me)₂]⁺ions, respectively, where M is the molecular mass of a respective TMS or TBDMS derivative of methylphosphonic ester). APCPhI mass spectra recorded in the presence of acetone as a reagent substance consisted of only peaks of [M + H]⁺and [M + MA+ H]⁺ions (MAis acetone molecule). The corresponding detection limits for silylated derivatives in APPhI and APCPhI were 30–125 pg and 1.1–23 pg, respectively (depending on the analyte).  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetone 3aatmospheric pressure 3adetection limit 3aesters 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3aionization 3amolecular weight 3asilicon 3atumor necrosis factors1 aRevelsky, I.

Consideration of both climatic and non-climatic factors is required since non-climatic factors could be controlled to build resilience against floods. The indicator-based flood vulnerability index methodology is applicable worldwide, but the indicators used in this study were specifically related to the Pacific Island context. In the context of fluvial flood vulnerability, effects of land management and climate change are not mutually exclusive of each other. Consequently, vulnerability assessments should consider the connection between people’s actions and ecosystems for the entire catchment area since upstream land use practices influence flood vulnerabilities downstream. In our research, a community-based flood vulnerability index system in conjunction with rainfall variability and land use assessments was used to quantitatively and qualitatively analyze the flood vulnerability, and it was found that increased rainfall, poor agricultural practices, gravel extraction, and improper waste management predominantly increased the exposure and sensitivity of midstream and downstream communities to river floods by modifying river morphology. Midstream communities in the Waimanu Catchment were most vulnerable to river floods due to their very low adaptive capacity in terms of poor ecosystem health and lack of natural resources to cope with the subsequent impacts of floods, being most sensitive to changes in land use and land cover.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimate change 3aenvironmental health 3agravel 3ahumans 3aland use 3aland use and land cover maps 3apeople 3arain 3ariparian areas 3arisk assessment 3arivers 3awaste management 3awatersheds 3aFiji1 aDe Ramon N’Yeurt, Antoine1 aIese, Viliamu0 tRegional environmental change.g2021 Sept., v. 21, no. 3 p.83-83dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:J000000303x1436-37987nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10113-021-01824-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01806naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245013100169300001600300520068000316592002800996650003401024650002001058650002101078650002201099650001401121650000901135650001101144650001501155650002501170700002001195700002901215773011901244856008401363852000901447655001201456IND60090107920221118001716.0141102e201101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009010792DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbapap.2010.07.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLaursen, Tomas10aConformational changes of the NADPH-dependent cytochrome P450 reductase in the course of electron transfer to cytochromes P450  ap. 132-138.  aThe NADPH-dependent cytochrome P450 reductase (CPR) is a key electron donor to eucaryotic cytochromes P450 (CYPs). CPR shuttles electrons from NADPH through the FAD and FMN-coenzymes into the iron of the prosthetic heme-group of the CYP. In the course of these electron transfer reactions, CPR undergoes large conformational changes. This mini-review discusses the new evidence provided for such conformational changes involving a combination of a “swinging” and “rotating” model and highlights the molecular mechanisms by which formation of these conformations are controlled and thereby enables CPR to serve as an effective electron transferring “nano-machine”.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNADH or NADPH oxidoreductases 3aNADP (coenzyme) 3acytochrome P-450 3aelectron transfer 3aelectrons 3airon 3amodels 3aprostheses 3aprotein conformation1 aJensen, Kenneth1 aMøller, Birger Lindberg0 tBiochimica et biophysica acta.g2011 Jan., v. 1814, no. 1 p.132-138dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12097x1878-14547nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbapap.2010.07.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01883naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002800152245009000180300001600270520062000286592002800906650001600934650002500950650001500975650001700990650001401007650001801021650002401039650001301063650002001076653003901096653002201135653001601157653002301173700001901196700001901215700001501234700001901249773009801268856008601366852000901452655001201461IND60604459820221120213235.0180717e20150115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060445982DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apenergy.2014.09.0332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKashkooli, Ali Ghorbani10aEffects of structural design on the performance of electrical double layer capacitors  ap. 631-639.  aThe effect of different structural designs on the performance of electrical double layer capacitors (EDLCs) has been studied through a mathematical model that considers the mass transfer and conservation of charge equations.

The aim of this work was evaluation of quality of the essential oil and extending of the knowledge about chemical composition of essential oil from ribwort (Plantago lanceolata L.) and proportional representation of compounds. Extractions of essential oils from samples of ribwort were performed by hydrodistillation. GC-MS and GC-FID techniques were used for investigation of the qualitative and semi-quantitative content of aromatic compounds in the essential oils, respectively. Major aroma constituents of ribwort leaves were groups of fatty acids 28.0–52.1 % (the most abundant palmitic acid 15.3–32.0 %), oxidated monoterpenes 4.3–13.2 % (linalool 2.7–3.5 %), aldehydes and ketones 6.9–10.0 % (pentyl vinyl ketone 2.0–3.4 %) and alcohols 3.8–9.2 % (1-octen-3-ol 2.4–8.2 %). In relative high amount were identified apocarotenoids (1.5–2.3 %) which are important constituents because of their intense fragrant. The importance is in potential manufacture control of feedstocks before producing of food supplements.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aPlantago lanceolata 3aaldehydes 3aaromatic compounds 3achemical composition 3adietary supplements 3aessential oils 3afeedstocks 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3ahydrodistillation 3aketones 3aleaves 3alinalool 3amanufacturing 3aoctenol 3aodors 3apalmitic acid1 aJanda, Václav,1 aBajerová, Petra1 aKremr, Daniel1 aEisner, Aleš1 aVentura, Karel0 tJournal of food science and technology.g2016 Mar., v. 53, no. 3 p.1576-1584dSpringer IndiawJournal:jnl16929x0022-11557nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13197-015-2083-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02888naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002300150245012200173300001400295520156500309592002801874650002901902650001101931650002301942650002601965650001301991650001502004650001402019650001102033650001502044650001402059650001202073650001202085650001102097650001302108650001202121650001002133651001902143700002302162700002602185773013802211856008402349852000902433655001202442IND60123496220221118074834.0150325e20140102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012349622DNAL7 a10.1080/00028487.2013.8291222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRawding, Daniel J.10aGenetic-Based Estimates of Adult Chinook Salmon Spawner Abundance from Carcass Surveys and Juvenile Out-Migrant Traps  ap. 55-67.  aDue to the challenges associated with monitoring in riverine environments, unbiased and precise spawner abundance estimates are often lacking for populations of Pacific salmon Oncorhynchus spp. listed under the Federal Endangered Species Act. We investigated genetic approaches to estimate the 2009 spawner abundance for a population of Columbia River Chinook Salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha via genetic mark–recapture and rarefaction curves. The marks were the genotyped carcasses collected from the spawning area during the first sampling event. The second sampling event consisted of a collection of juveniles from a downstream migrant trap located below the spawning area. The parents that assigned to the juveniles through parentage analysis were considered the recaptures, which was a subset of the genotypes captured in the second sample. Using the Petersen estimator, the genetic mark–recapture spawner abundance estimates based on the binomial and hypergeometric models were 910 and 945 Chinook Salmon, respectively. These results were in agreement with independently derived spawner abundance estimates based on redd counts, area-under-the-curve methods, and carcass tagging based on the Jolly–Seber model. Using a rarefaction curve approach, which required only the juvenile offspring sample, our estimate of successful breeders was 781 fish. Our genetic-based approaches provide new alternatives to estimate adult Pacific salmon abundance in challenging environmental conditions or for populations with poor or unknown estimates of precision.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOncorhynchus tshawytscha 3aadults 3aendangered species 3aenvironmental factors 3agenotype 3agenotyping 3ajuveniles 3amodels 3amonitoring 3aparentage 3aparents 3aprogeny 3asalmon 3aspawning 3asurveys 3atraps 3aColumbia River1 aSharpe, Cameron S.1 aBlankenship, Scott M.0 tTransactions of the American Fisheries Society.g2014 Jan. 2, v. 143, no. 1 p.55-67dTaylor & FranciswJournal:19703x1548-86597nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00028487.2013.8291223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03705naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100002000188245015000208300001800358506007600376520185700452592002802309506003702337650002102374650002502395650001202420650001002432650001902442650001302461650001202474650004102486650001602527650004102543650002502584650002102609650002302630650002302653650001002676650002802686650002002714650001302734650000902747650001602756650002502772650002102797700002202818700002102840700002602861700001702887773013202904856008203036852000903118655001203127IND60520753720221207083833.0180909e201603  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052075372DNAL7 a10.1007/s13197-015-2096-52doi7 aPMC49847172pmcid7 a275702942pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDikshit, Piyush10aAntihypercholesterolemic and antioxidant effect of sterol rich methanol extract of stem of Musa sapientum (banana) in cholesterol fed wistar rats  ap. 1690-1697.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aMusa sapientum Linn. (English ‘Banana’ family Musaceae), is a plant with nutritive, as well as medicinal value. Antihypercholesterolemic and antioxidant effect of methanolic extract of stem of this plant was investigated in hypercholesterolemic rats. Rats were made hypercholesterolemic by feeding cholesterol (100 mg/kg/day) suspended in soya oil. Treatment groups received extract at a dose of 10, 20 and 40 mg/kg/day in addition to cholesterol orally once daily. Fasting blood samples were collected before and after 6 weeks treatment. Animals were sacrificed and liver stored at -80 °C. Total cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol and triacylglycerol were estimated in blood. Malondialdehyde, reduced glutathione, superoxide dismutase and catalase were measured in blood and liver. Total lipids, HMG CoA redutase and lipoprotein lipase were investigated in liver. Most effective dose was found to be 20 mg/kg/day. Rise in total cholesterol, LDL + VLDL-cholesterol and triacylglycerol in animals receiving only cholesterol was 179 %, 417 % and 74 % respectively, while in animals receiving 20 mg/kg dose rise in these parameters was restricted to 40 %, 106 % and 24 %. HDL-cholesterol decreased by 12 % in extract treated group, while it decreased to 36 % in untreated hypercholesterolemic rats. Malonaldialdehyde, marker of lipid peroxidation decreased while reduced glutathione and enzymes superoxide dismutase and catalase increased significantly in blood and liver (p < 0.01). Total lipids in liver decreased and enzymes of lipid metabolism viz. HMG CoA redutase and lipoprotein lipase were restored to near normal. Gas chromatography mass spectroscopy indicated high content of sterols in extract. Study demonstrated that methanol extract of stem of Musa sapientum has significant antihypercholesterolemic and antioxidant effects.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aMusa paradisiaca 3aantioxidant activity 3abananas 3ablood 3ablood sampling 3acatalase 3afasting 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3aglutathione 3ahigh density lipoprotein cholesterol 3ahypercholesterolemia 3alipid metabolism 3alipid peroxidation 3alipoprotein lipase 3aliver 3alow density lipoprotein 3amalondialdehyde 3amethanol 3arats 3asoybean oil 3asuperoxide dismutase 3atriacylglycerols1 aTyagi, Mool Kumar1 aShukla, Kirtikar1 aGambhir, Jasvindar K.1 aShukla, Rimi0 tJournal of food science and technology.g2016 Mar., v. 53, no. 3 p.1690-1697dSpringer IndiawJournal:jnl16929x0022-11557nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13197-015-2096-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03664naa a2200829 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100002500188245013600213500002200349506007600371520135700447592002801804506003701832650000801869650002201877650001801899650002501917650003101942650001401973650001601987650001902003650002302022650001202045650002002057650001602077650001602093650001702109650002402126650001002150650002002160650001802180650000902198650001202207650001702219650002302236650003202259653000802291653000902299653001002308653000802318653000902326653000802335653000802343653001102351653000902362653000802371653001402379653000902393653001002402653001102412653005302423653001702476653001702493653001602510653001702526700002102543700001902564700002002583700002002603700002302623700002302646773006302669856008102732852000902813655001202822IND60531962320221207112906.0160726s2016    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053196232DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tox.2016.07.0102doi7 aPMC52787922pmcid7 a274274942pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBalandaram, Gayathri10aLigand activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-β/δ suppresses liver tumorigenesis in hepatitis B transgenic mice  aPre-press version  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aPeroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-β/δ (PPARβ/δ) inhibits steatosis and inflammation, known risk factors for liver cancer. In this study, the effect of ligand activation of PPARβ/δ in modulating liver tumorigenesis in transgenic hepatitis B virus (HBV) mice was examined. Activation of PPARβ/δ in HBV mice reduced steatosis, the average number of liver foci, and tumor multiplicity. Reduced expression of hepatic CYCLIN D1 and c-MYC, tumor necrosis factor alpha (Tnfa) mRNA, serum levels of alanine aminotransaminase, and an increase in apoptotic signaling was also observed following ligand activation of PPARβ/δ in HBV mice compared to controls. Inhibition of Tnfa mRNA expression was not observed in wild-type hepatocytes. Ligand activation of PPARβ/δ inhibited lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced mRNA expression of Tnfa in wild-type, but not in Pparβ/δ-null Kupffer cells. Interestingly, LPS-induced expression of Tnfa mRNA was also inhibited in Kupffer cells from a transgenic mouse line that expressed a DNA binding mutant form of PPARβ/δ compared to controls. Combined, these results suggest that ligand activation of PPARβ/δ attenuates hepatic tumorigenesis in HBV transgenic mice by inhibiting steatosis and cell proliferation, enhancing hepatocyte apoptosis, and modulating anti-inflammatory activity in Kupffer cells.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDNA 3aHepatitis B virus 3aKupffer cells 3aalanine transaminase 3aanti-inflammatory activity 3aapoptosis 3ablood serum 3acarcinogenesis 3acell proliferation 3acyclins 3agene expression 3ahepatitis B 3ahepatocytes 3ainflammation 3alipopolysaccharides 3aliver 3aliver neoplasms 3amessenger RNA 3amice 3amutants 3arisk factors 3atransgenic animals 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha 0aALT 0aCCl4 0aCOX-2 0aDBM 0aERK5 0aHBV 0aLPS 0aNF-κB 0aPARP 0aPBF 0aPPARβ/δ 0aPGE2 0aSTAT3 0aTNF-α 0aPeroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-β/δ 0aliver cancer 0aKupffer cell 0ahepatitis B 0ainflammation1 aKramer, Lance R.1 aKang, Boo-Hyon1 aMurray, Iain A.1 aPerdew, Gary H.1 aGonzalez, Frank J.1 aPeters, Jeffrey M.0 tToxicology.g2016, dElsevier Ireland Ltdx0300-483X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tox.2016.07.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02735naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001800143245015100161300001600312520137000328592002801698650001501726650001301741650002101754650002201775650003601797650001201833650001401845650002101859653002201880653001401902653002101916653002401937653003301961653001101994700001502005700001402020700001502034700001802049700001702067773011802084856007802202852000902280655001202289IND60563082020221120144215.0210122e20170201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056308202DNAL7 a10.1515/znb-2016-02092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLian, Zhaoxun10aCrystal structures and third-order optical properties of three manganese(II) complexes constructed from N-heterocyclic and polycarboxylate ligands  ap. 125-131.  aThree new manganese(II) complexes, {[Mn(PTP)]₂[Mn(PTP)(H₂O)]}(BTA)₂·2H₂O (1), [Mn(PTP)(ODA)]₂ (2), and [Mn(FTP)(ODA)]₂·H₂O (3), were synthesized by the reactions of manganese acetate and polycarboxylic acid in the presence of N-heterocyclic ligands (where PTP=4′-phenyl-2,2′:6′,2″-terpyridine, H₃BTA=benzene-1,3,5-tricarboxylic acid, H₂ODA=4,4′-oxydibenzoic acid, FTP=4′-(furan-2-yl)-2,2′:6′,2″-terpyridine). In complex 1, each BTA ligand serves as a μ₃-bridge to link three Mn(II) centers, whereas each Mn(II) center is coordinated by two BTA ligands. This connection mode results in a grid sheet. Complexes 2 and 3 have very similar molecular structures with Mn(II) centers connected by ODA ligands to result in ring-like arrays. We investigated the third-order nonlinear optical (NLO) properties of the three complexes by single beam Z-scan techniques. Complexes 1–3 exhibit strong third-order NLO reverse saturable absorption with NLO absorptive indices β=1.32×10⁻⁶, 3.01×10⁻⁶, and 9.42×10⁻⁶ m W⁻¹, respectively. In addition, complex 1 shows all excellent self-focusing effect with an NLO refractive index of γ=1.25×10⁻¹² m² W⁻¹. The third-order NLO susceptibility χ⁽³⁾ of the three complexes were calculated as 47.55×10⁻⁸, 4.85×10⁻⁸, and 15.16×10⁻⁸ esu, respectively.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3aacetates 3acarboxylic acids 3acrystal structure 3aheterocyclic nitrogen compounds 3aligands 3amanganese 3arefractive index 0acrystal structure 0amanganese 0apolycarboxylates 0aterpyridine ligands 0athird-order nonlinear optics 0aZ-scan1 aZhao, Ning1 aLiu, Ping1 aAn, Caixia1 aYang, Fengxia1 aWang, Airong0 tZeitschrift für Naturforschung.g2017 Feb. 1, v. 72, no. 2 p.125-131dDe GruyterwJournal:23182x1865-71177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1515/znb-2016-02093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03743naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024001700113024002100130024003300151024001100184040001800195100001300213245011500226300001800341500000900359506017300368520178200541592002802323650001302351650002002364650002902384650002202413650001302435650002102448650001302469650001802482650001902500650001502519650001602534650001502550651001202565700002002577700001802597700001802615700002202633700002302655773022002678856011202898856008003010956009303090961000903183852000903192655001203201IND60006044520221214231437.0191028e201409  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6000604452DNAL7 a256032462pmid7 a2982682aris7 a10113/604452hdl7 a10.2134/jeq2013.03.01102doi8 ans6677  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYen, Haw14aThe Role of Interior Watershed Processes in Improving Parameter Estimation and Performance of Watershed Models  ap. 1601-1613.  aepub  aWorks produced by employees of the U.S. Government as part of their official duties are not copyrighted within the U.S. The content of this document is not copyrighted.  aWatershed models typically are evaluated solely through comparison of in-stream water and nutrient fluxes with measured data using established performance criteria, whereas processes and responses within the interior of the watershed that govern these global fluxes often are neglected. Due to the large number of parameters at the disposal of these models, circumstances may arise in which excellent global results are achieved using inaccurate magnitudes of these “intra-watershed” responses. When used for scenario analysis, a given model hence may inaccurately predict the global, in-stream effect of implementing land-use practices at the interior of the watershed. In this study, data regarding internal watershed behavior are used to constrain parameter estimation to maintain realistic intra-watershed responses while also matching available in-stream monitoring data. The methodology is demonstrated for the Eagle Creek Watershed in central Indiana. Streamflow and nitrate (NO₃) loading are used as global in-stream comparisons, with two process responses, the annual mass of denitrification and the ratio of NO₃ losses from subsurface and surface flow, used to constrain parameter estimation. Results show that imposing these constraints not only yields realistic internal watershed behavior but also provides good in-stream comparisons. Results further demonstrate that in the absence of incorporating intra-watershed constraints, evaluation of nutrient abatement strategies could be misleading, even though typical performance criteria are satisfied. Incorporating intra-watershed responses yields a watershed model that more accurately represents the observed behavior of the system and hence a tool that can be used with confidence in scenario evaluation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaccuracy 3adenitrification 3aenvironmental monitoring 3ahydrologic models 3aland use 3amodel validation 3anitrates 3aoverland flow 3apollution load 3aprediction 3astream flow 3awatersheds 3aIndiana1 aBailey, Ryan T.1 aArabi, Mazdak1 aAhmadi, Mehdi1 aWhite, Michael J.1 aArnold, Jeffrey G.0 tJournal of environmental quality.g2014 Sept., v. 43, no. 5 p.1601-1613dThe American Society of Agronomy, Crop Science Society of America, and Soil Science Society of America, Inc.wJournal:jnl1642x0047-24257nnas40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/604453Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2134/jeq2013.03.01103Available from publisher's site  aARIS submissionbhttp://submit-u.nal.usda.gov/system/files/submissions/Yen%20JEQ2014.pdf  aUSDA  aDNAL 7aarticle01547naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002000142245016600162300001400328520047000342592002800812650001400840650001500854650002600869650001900895650001500914651001100929653002300940653001100963653001100974700002000985773011701005856007801122852000901200655001201209IND60127026720221117190806.0151110e201409  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012702672DNAL7 a10.1639/079.031.03042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStehn, Sarah E.10aTrematodon laetevirens (Bruchiaceae) New to the United States, and Other Interesting Bryophyte Records from Wrangell-St. Elias National Park and Preserve, Alaska  ap. 93-98.  aThe second North American locality of the moss Trematodon laetevirens Hakelier & J.-P.

The occurrence of a particular species may reflect the microclimate of the locality. Pleurocarpous mosses form extensive cover on the substrate and provide microenvironment for the activity of bacteria, fungi and invertebrates, thus constituting a kind of bryosystem. Present study has revealed 42 species of pleurocarpous mosses belonging to 30 genera and 16 families from Imphal district, Manipur, India. Hypnaceae are found to be most frequent. Majority of taxa are found as epiphytic growing on tree bark and branches. Erpodium mangiferae, Erythrodontium julaceum, Pterygynandrum decolor, Fabronia assamica are found most widely spread in the studied area. It seems that these species have high tolerance and adaptability to survive in the dry bark. Most of the pleurocarpous mosses in the present collection display mat form.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHypnaceae 3abacteria 3abark 3abranches 3achemistry 3aepiphytes 3afungi 3ahabitat preferences 3ahabitats 3ainvertebrates 3amicroclimate 3amosses and liverworts 3atemperature 3atrees 3aIndia 0aEpiphytic mosses 0ahabitat specificity 0atropical bryophytes 0agrowth form1 aSanavar, 1 aBahuguna, Y.M.1 aUniyal, P.L0 tEvansia.g2014 Sept., v. 31, no. 3 p.99-108dThe American Bryological and Lichenological Societyx0747-98597nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1639%2F079.031.03053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03366naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245018900168300001600357520153500373592002801908650002401936650002101960650002501981650003202006650002002038650003102058650002602089650001802115650001202133650002802145650001702173650001202190650001502202650001402217650001802231650005202249650002902301650004002330700002102370700002202391700001902413700002202432700002102454700001902475700001902494700002002513700001902533700001902552700001702571773011902588856008402707852000902791655001202800IND60090108420221118001927.0141102e201102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009010842DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbapap.2010.10.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAkama, Kuniko10aProteomic identification of differentially expressed genes in neural stem cells and neurons differentiated from embryonic stem cells of cynomolgus monkey (Macaca fascicularis) in vitro  ap. 265-276.  aUnderstanding neurogenesis is valuable for the treatment of nervous system disorders. However, there is currently limited information about the molecular events associated with the transition from primate ES cells to neural cells. We therefore sought to identify the proteins involved in neurogenesis, from Macaca fascicularis ES cells (CMK6 cell line) to neural stem (NS) cells to neurons using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE), peptide mass fingerprinting (PMF), and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS-MS). During the differentiation of highly homogeneous ES cells to NS cells, we identified 17 proteins with increased expression, including fatty acid binding protein 7 (FABP7), collapsin response mediator protein 2 (CRMP2), and cellular retinoic acid binding protein 1 (CRABP1), and seven proteins with decreased expression. In the differentiation of NS cells to neurons, we identified three proteins with increased expression, including CRMP2, and 10 proteins with decreased expression. Of these proteins, FABP7 is a marker of NS cells, CRMP2 is involved in axon guidance, and CRABP1 is thought to regulate retinoic acid access to its nuclear receptors. Western blot analysis confirmed the upregulation of FABP7 and CRABP1 in NS cells, and the upregulation of CRMP2 in NS cells and neurons. RT-PCR results showed that CRMP2 and FABP7 mRNAs were also upregulated in NS cells, while CRABP1 mRNA was unchanged. These results provide insight into the molecular basis of monkey neural differentiation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMacaca fascicularis 3aWestern blotting 3aembryonic stem cells 3afatty acid-binding proteins 3agene expression 3agene expression regulation 3aliquid chromatography 3amessenger RNA 3amonkeys 3anervous system diseases 3aneurogenesis 3aneurons 3aproteomics 3areceptors 3aretinoic acid 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3atandem mass spectrometry 3atwo-dimensional gel electrophoresis1 aHorikoshi, Tomoe1 aNakayama, Takashi1 aOtsu, Masahiro1 aImaizumi, Noriaki1 aNakamura, Megumi1 aToda, Tosifusa1 aInuma, Michiko1 aHirano, Hisashi1 aKondo, Yasushi1 aSuzuki, Yutaka1 aInoue, Nobuo0 tBiochimica et biophysica acta.g2011 Feb., v. 1814, no. 2 p.265-276dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12097x1878-14547nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbapap.2010.10.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle00829naa a2200253 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100001500115245002600130300001600156520016800172650002400340650001800364650002800382651001500410773007500425852000900500939003300509945000800542946001300550655001200563991583374160742620221119052840.0911024e199109  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI910031442DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPowell, R.14aThe only game in town  ap. 52- 103.  aA school food district in New Mexico has shown a profit by using their facilities to cater large private events.

The model employs the lower limit temperature for germination (T(l)) as an index of seed population dormancy status. While population mean for T(l) (T(l)(50)) and T(l) distribution within the population (σ(Tl)) are allowed to vary as seeds are released from dormancy, other thermal parameters characterizing the germination thermal responses (base, optimal and maximal temperatures, and thermal time required for germination) and the higher limit temperature for germination (T(h)) are held constant. In order to relate changes in T(l)(50) and σ(Tl) to variable time and temperature, a stratification thermal time index (S(tt)) was developed, which consists of the accumulation of thermal time units under a threshold temperature for dormancy loss to occur. Therefore, T(l)(50) and σ(Tl) varied in relation to the accumulation of Stt according to time and temperature. To derive model equations, changes in seed population thermal parameters were estimated for buried seeds stored at 1.6, 7 and 12°C for 110 d. Seeds were exhumed at regular intervals, and were incubated at 15°C and at a gradually increasing temperature regime in the range 6–25°C. The germination time-course curves obtained were reproduced using a mathematical model. Thermal parameters that best fit simulated and experimentally obtained germination time-course curves were determined. Model performance was evaluated against data of two unrelated experiments, showing acceptable prediction of timing and percentage of germination of seeds exhumed from field and controlled temperature conditions. 3aPolygonum aviculare 3aburied seeds 3aequations 3amodel validation 3aprediction 3aquantitative analysis 3aseed dormancy 3aseed germination 3asimulation models 3atemperature profiles 3athermal properties1 aBenech-Arnold, Roberto Luis0 tSeed science research.g2003 Mar., v. 13, no. 1 p.55-68x0960-25857nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1079/SSR20021243Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b00000000c20140415  aNon-US 7aarticle02360naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127072001700144100001500161245015600176300001800332500001500350520107100365650002601436650002001462650002501482650001201507650002201519650001901541650000701560650001001567650002801577650002701605650001901632650002401651653001701675653001301692700001701705700001601722773008401738852000901822930003301831945002501864946001301889655001201902IND4375590920221119051330.0051028e200509  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437559092DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

M339-M344.  a2019-12-05  aLow-acid fermented sausages (fuet and chorizo) were manufactured to evaluate the combined effect of high pressure processing (HPP) and ripening on foodborne pathogens. Raw sausages inoculated with a three-strain cocktail of Salmonella ser. Derby, London, and Schwarzengrund, and a three-strain cocktail of L. monocytogenes ser. 1/2 c and 4b were pressurized at 300 MPa for 10 min at 17 degrees C. Afterwards, sausages were ripened at 12 degrees C and 80% RH for 27 d. Salmonella counts decreased in all studied sausages during ripening. However, the application of HPP as an additional hurdle to the ripening process produced a greater decrease in the Salmonella population, showing lower counts (3 MPN/g) in ripened sausages. By contrast, lower values of L. monocytogenes counts were obtained in non-treated (NT) than in pressurized sausages due to the delay of pH drop caused by HPP inactivation of endogenous lactic acid bacteria. After pressurization of raw sausages at 300 MPa, a discoloration of sausages was observed, coinciding with an increase in L* values. 3amicrobial competition 3afermented foods 3alactic acid bacteria 3achorizo 3amicrobial ecology 3afood pathogens 3apH 3acolor 3ahigh pressure treatment 3aListeria monocytogenes 3alow acid foods 3aSalmonella enterica 0afuet sausage 0asausages1 aAymerich, T.1 aGarriga, M.0 tJournal of food science.g2005 Sept., v. 70, no. 7 p.M339-M344x0022-11477nnas  aDNAL  a20060914b20061003c00000000  aINDd2CTe2005/11/29  aOther US 7aarticle02743naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003700092040001800129100001900147245008600166300001600252520166000268650001401928650002101942650001901963650001601982650001601998650002702014650001702041650002502058650001602083700001902099700001402118700001702132773008002149852000902229856008702238939003302325946001102358655001202369IND4464353120221119051027.0121023e200310  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446435312DNAL7 a10.1080/02652030310001524512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGilsenan, M.B.10aValidation analysis of probabilistic models of dietary exposure to food additives  ap. S61-S72.  aThe validity of a range of simple conceptual models designed specifically for the estimation of food additive intakes using probabilistic analysis was assessed. Modelled intake estimates that fell below traditional conservative point estimates of intake and above ‘true’ additive intakes (calculated from a reference database at brand level) were considered to be in a valid region. Models were developed for 10 food additives by combining food intake data, the probability of an additive being present in a food group and additive concentration data. Food intake and additive concentration data were entered as raw data or as a lognormal distribution, and the probability of an additive being present was entered based on the per cent brands or the per cent eating occasions within a food group that contained an additive. Since the three model components assumed two possible modes of input, the validity of eight (23) model combinations was assessed. All model inputs were derived from the reference database. An iterative approach was employed in which the validity of individual model components was assessed first, followed by validation of full conceptual models. While the distribution of intake estimates from models fell below conservative intakes, which assume that the additive is present at maximum permitted levels (MPLs) in all foods in which it is permitted, intake estimates were not consistently above ‘true’ intakes. These analyses indicate the need for more complex models for the estimation of food additive intakes using probabilistic analysis. Such models should incorporate information on market share and/or brand loyalty. 3adatabases 3adietary exposure 3afood additives 3afood groups 3afood intake 3alognormal distribution 3amarket share 3aprobabilistic models 3aprobability1 aThompson, R.L.1 aLambe, J.1 aGibney, M.J.0 tFood additives & contaminants.g2003 Oct., v. 20 p.S61-S72x0265-203X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02652030310001524513Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b00000000c20121023  aNon-US 7aarticle02390naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130100001400148245008600162300001600248520140400264650001901668650001601687650002301703650001001726650001901736650001301755650001201768700002801780700001501808773008801823852000901911856008801920939003302008946001102041655001202052IND4464353420221119051424.0121023e200310  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446435342DNAL7 a10.1080/026520303100016050512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWenzl, T.10aAnalytical methods for the determination of acrylamide in food products: a review  ap. 885-902.  aIn early 2002, the Swedish National Food Administration reported high acrylamide levels in heat-treated carbohydrate-rich foods. Consequently, intensive activity began examining the many different types of food, and thousands of analyses have been undertaken world wide. Measurement data have been published in many different types of media. Within this flood of publications, there are only a limited number of articles concerned with the technical aspects of the measurements. This review focuses on the state-of-the-art in the analysis of acrylamide in foodstuffs. It covers information on methods from peer-reviewed articles and other sources (e.g. a survey carried out among official and private laboratories of the Member States of the European Union). Alternative methods are presented and discussed alongside the more common measurement techniques for acrylamide in foodstuffs. Special attention is given to sample preparation. The greatest differences between the analytical methods was for acrylamide extraction and clean-up. The influence of different extraction techniques or extraction solvents/solvent mixtures on the measurement results has not yet been fully investigated. There is also a lack of understanding about the sample clean-up. Since both might have a large impact on the results of the analysis, this review should also be considered as a basis for further investigations. 3aEuropean Union 3aacrylamides 3aanalytical methods 3afoods 3aheat treatment 3asolvents 3asurveys1 aCalle, M.

A special cover unit of the sample vial was adopted in the coupling method. To evaluate the proposed method, phenols were used as model analytes. The parameters affecting the extraction efficiency were investigated, including the configuration of acceptor phase, kind and concentration of acceptor solution, extraction temperature and time, salt-out effect, sample volume, etc. The optimal enrichment factors of HS-LPME were obtained with the sample volume of about half of sample vials, which were confirmed by both the theoretical prediction and experimental results. The enrichment factors were obtained from 520 to 1270. The limits of detection (LODs, S/N=3) were in the range from 0.5 to 1ng/mL each phenol. The recoveries were from 87.2% to 92.7% and the relative standard deviations (RSDs) were lower than 5.7% (n =6). The proposed method was successfully applied to the quantitative analysis of the phenols in tap water, and proved to be a simple, convenient and reliable sample preconcentration and determination method for volatile analytes in water samples. 3acapillary electrophoresis 3achromatography 3adetection limit 3aheadspace analysis 3aliquid-phase microextraction 3aphenol 3aprediction 3aquantitative analysis 3atap water 3atemperature1 aHe, You-Zhao1 aGan, Wu-Er1 aYu, Chang-Zhu1 aHan, Fang1 aLing, Da-Si0 tJournal of chromatography.g2010 Feb. 19, v. 1217, no. 8 p.1203-1207dElsevierx0021-96737nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chroma.2009.12.0283Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02309naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001700145245011500162300001400277500002400291520106800315650001501383650001801398650002001416650001801436650001501454650002201469650001501491650001801506650001901524650001201543650001401555650001601569650001601585650001401601650001701615700002001632700001601652700001801668773009501686852000901781856008501790655001201875IND4432143020221119051325.0100129s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443214302DNAL7 a10.1007/s10228-009-0122-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYamanaka, Yu10aMonophyletic origin of the dorsally arched lateral line in Teleostei: evidence from nerve innervation patterns  ap. 49-61.  aIncludes references  aBranching patterns of the horizontal septum lateral line nerves (HSN) were studied in 123 teleostean species (including literature records) assigned to 96 families in 28 orders, primarily to indentify the group characterized by the presence of the dorsal longitudinal collector nerve (DLCN) for innervation of the trunk lateral line. In nonacanthomorphs, DLCN was absent, the trunk lateral line being mostly innervated by branches directly detached from HSN or those derived from the collector nerve running parallel to the former. In acanthomorphs, the dorsally arched trunk lateral line, typical of the group, was uniformly innervated by DLCN, indicating that presence of the latter was a synapomorphy of the group. Within the latter, DLCN was absent in Gasterosteiformes (Fistularia and Macroramphosus), Mugilidae, Atherinomorpha, Champsodontidae, Blenniidae, Callionymidae, Gobioidei, Istiophoridae, Gempylidae, Cynoglossidae, Ostraciidae, and Molidae.

The main objective of this investigation was to develop a protocol for the expression of somatic embryogenesis from adult tissues of this cultivar to allow clonal micropropagation. Very little work has been done on this process from somatic tissues in Moroccan cultivars, particularly on 'Moroccan Picholine', known for its recalcitrance to in-vitro regeneration. Explants used were leaves and petioles, taken from in-vitro-rejuvenated plantlets and cultivated for 6 weeks on four induction media made up of half-strength olive medium (OM/2) as basal medium supplemented with various combinations of plant growth regulators (PGRs): 1) thidiazuron (TDZ) and 3-indolbutyric acid (IBA); 2) TDZ and α-naphthaleneacetic acid (NAA); 3) zeatin riboside (ZR) and IBA; and 4) ZR and NAA. Induced calluses were transferred to proliferation medium, consisting of OM supplemented with IBA, for 4 weeks. Grown calluses were subsequently transferred to the expression medium olive cyclic embryogenesis basal medium (ECO) with replenishment of the medium every 4 weeks. For the first time, we observed the formation of somatic embryos from somatic explants of 'Moroccan Picholine'; petioles cultured on the induction medium supplemented with IBA and ZR showed an embryogenesis expression rate of 6.93%, while the induction supplemented with NAA and ZR gave 11.73% for petioles and 7.66% for the intermediate leaf blade. At the same time, adventitious buds were induced when the induction medium was supplemented with TDZ and NAA. 3aOlea europaea 3aadults 3abuds 3acultivars 3aculture media 3aexplants 3aindole butyric acid 3aleaf blade 3amicropropagation 3anaphthaleneacetic acid 3aolives 3apetioles 3aplantlets 3aprotocols 3asomatic cells 3asomatic embryogenesis 3asomatic embryos 3athidiazuron 3atissues 3azeatin 3aMorocco1 aBelkoura, I.1 aLoutfi, I.0 tActa horticulturae.g2018 Apr. 30, , no. 1199 p.91-96dInternational Society for Horticultural Science.wJournal:jnl46289x0567-75727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.17660/ActaHortic.2018.1199.15  aDNAL 7aarticle03101naa a2200613 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092024002200127024001900149040001800168100002300186245006000209300001600269500002400285506007600309520131700385506003701702650000801739650001901747650002701766650001401793650002301807650002301830650001601853650001101869650000901880650002201889650002701911650001301938650002001951650001301971650001401984650001001998651001202008651001002020700002602030700001902056700003102075700001602106700002302122700002102145700002202166700001702188700002102205700001602226700002102242700002402263773009402287852000902381856008502390655001202475IND4432088920221207051731.0100129s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443208892DNAL7 a10.1007/s00114-009-0629-32doi7 aPMC28124222pmcid7 a200331242pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCappellini, Enrico12aA multidisciplinary study of archaeological grape seeds  ap. 205-217.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aWe report here the first integrated investigation of both ancient DNA and proteins in archaeobotanical samples: medieval grape (Vitis vinifera L.) seeds, preserved by anoxic waterlogging, from an early medieval (seventh-eighth century A.D.) Byzantine rural settlement in the Salento area (Lecce, Italy) and a late (fourteenth-fifteenth century A.D.) medieval site in York (England). Pyrolysis gas chromatography mass spectrometry documented good carbohydrate preservation, whilst amino acid analysis revealed approximately 90% loss of the original protein content. In the York sample, mass spectrometry-based sequencing identified several degraded ancient peptides. Nuclear microsatellite locus (VVS2, VVMD5, VVMD7, ZAG62 and ZAG79) analysis permitted a tentative comparison of the genetic profiles of both the ancient samples with the modern varieties. The ability to recover microsatellite DNA has potential to improve biomolecular analysis on ancient grape seeds from archaeological contexts. Although the investigation of five microsatellite loci cannot assign the ancient samples to any geographic region or modern cultivar, the results allow speculation that the material from York was not grown locally, whilst the remains from Supersano could represent a trace of contacts with the eastern Mediterranean.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDNA 3aVitis vinifera 3aamino acid composition 3acultivars 3aflooded conditions 3agas chromatography 3agrape seeds 3agrapes 3aloci 3amass spectrometry 3amicrosatellite repeats 3apeptides 3aprotein content 3aproteins 3apyrolysis 3aseeds 3aEngland 3aItaly1 aGilbert, M.

S1-S7.  aThe Monte Carlo project was established to allow an international collaborative effort to define conceptual models for food chemical and nutrient exposure, to define and validate the software code to govern these models, to provide new or reconstructed databases for validation studies, and to use the new software code to complete validation modelling. Models were considered valid when they provided exposure estimates (ea) that could be shown not to underestimate the true exposure (eb), but at the same time are more realistic than the currently used conservative estimates (ec). Thus, validation required ebea<ec. In the case of pesticides, validation involved the collection of duplicate diets from 500 infants for pesticide analysis. In the case of intense sweeteners, a new consumption dataset was created among prescreened high consumers of intense sweeteners by recording, at brand level, all foods and beverages ingested over 12 days. In the case of nutrients and additives, existing databases were modified to minimize uncertainty over the model parameters. In most instances, it was possible to generate probabilistic models that fulfilled the validation criteria. 3aadditives 3aartificial sweeteners 3abeverages 3acomputer software 3adata collection 3adatabases 3adiet 3adietary exposure 3ainfants 3anutrients 3apesticides 3aprobabilistic models 3auncertainty1 aVoet, H. van der0 tFood additives & contaminants.g2003 Oct., v. 20 p.S1-S7x0265-203X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02652030310001349473Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b00000000c20121023  aNon-US 7aarticle01818naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002000145245014800165300001600313500002400329500001500353520065100368650001601019650001001035650000901045650001301054650001101067650001401078650001101092650001801103650002001121651001001141653001801151700001801169700002301187700001901210773009701229852000901326856008501335655001201420IND4432142320221119051401.0100129s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443214232DNAL7 a10.1007/s10228-009-0124-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKadota, Tatsuru10aDiel and lunar spawning periodicity of the hawkfish Paracirrhites forsteri (Cirrhitidae) on the reefs of Kuchierabu-jima Island, southern Japan  ap. 102-106.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-05  aWe observed spawning behavior of the hawkfish Paracirrhites forsteri on reefs of southern Japan. Spawning generally occurred after sunset, prior to the full and new moon with semi-lunar spawning peak periodicity. No egg predation was observed in spawning after sunset, and high tide often occurred at dusk in the lunar phases. Thus, diel timing and lunar synchronicity may increase larval survival. We found that the mating activity tended to start earlier in the day during early mating season than during mid-to-late mating season. The advantages of the earlier start of mating activity were also examined in relation to adult biology contexts. 3aperiodicity 3areefs 3aeggs 3aspawning 3aadults 3apredation 3alarvae 3aParacirrhites 3abreeding season 3aJapan 0amating season1 aSakai, Yoichi1 aHashimoto, Hiroaki1 aGushima, Kenji0 tIchthyological research.g2010 Jan., v. 57, no. 1 p.102-106dSpringer Japanx1341-89987nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10228-009-0124-z3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02147naa a2200289 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002800145245007100173300001600244500002400260520126800284650001101552650001401563650001901577650000901596650001201605700001801617700002201635773009401657852000901751856008501760655001201845IND4432089120221119051159.0100129s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443208912DNAL7 a10.1007/s00114-009-0627-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKapustjansky, Alexander10aBees use three-dimensional information to improve target detection  ap. 229-233.  aIncludes references  aBumblebee detection of a flat circular disc (two-dimensional (2D) presentation) and a disc which was presented 10 cm in front of a structured background (and thus provided three-dimensional (3D) cues) was compared. A dual choice test using a Y-maze apparatus was conducted to estimate the minimum visual angle at which the bees were able to detect the disc. At large visual angles of 15, 10 and 5° bees' performance between the 2D and the 3D presentation did not differ. However, when the disc subtended 3° at the bee's eye, the bees performed significantly better when 3D information was available. Overall, bees were able to detect a target subtending a 40% smaller visual angle when it was presented in front of the structured background compared to a 2D presentation. This suggests that previous reports on the limits of target detection in bees using flat stimuli might have underestimated the bees' ability to locate small flowers under natural conditions. Bees use motion parallax, i.e. the apparent relative motion of a stationary object against a background, for perceiving the third dimension. Our data suggest that bumblebees can integrate information from at least two types of feature detectors, motion and area, to improve single target detection. 3aBombus 3adetectors 3adigital images 3aeyes 3aflowers1 aChittka, Lars1 aSpaethe, Johannes0 tNaturwissenschaften.g2010 Feb., v. 97, no. 2 p.229-233dSpringer-Verlagx0028-10427nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00114-009-0627-53Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03288naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002900111040001800140100001600158245009800174300001600272500002400288520160600312650001301918650001501931650001201946650001401958650001901972650001601991650001402007650001202021650001002033650001402043650001702057650002002074650001202094650002402106650001102130650002402141650003002165650002102195650001102216650002002227650003602247650001402283650001402297650002402311650002402335650003602359650003902395650004302434650002402477700001802501773009102519852000902610856007902619655001202698IND4432076520221119051203.0100129s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443207652DNAL7 a199201172pmid7 a10.1530/REP-09-03632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSilva, L.A.10aLocal effect of the conceptus on uterine vascular perfusion during early pregnancy in heifers  ap. 453-463.  aIncludes references  aColour-Doppler ultrasonography was used to study the spatial relationship between vascular perfusion in the middle of each uterine horn and the reported location of the embryo proper and expanding conceptus using endometrial vascularity scores 1-4 (nil-maximal). Vascularity increased in both uterine horns between days 14 and 18 (day 0=ovulation) in nonpregnant heifers (n=6) but not in pregnant heifers (n=11). The increase was temporally associated with decreasing plasma progesterone and increasing oestradiol. In pregnant heifers, a transient increase in endometrial vascularity in the ipsilateral horn (horn with embryo) was not detected before day 18, despite a reported transient increase in blood flow in the ipsilateral uterine artery between days 13 and 17. Endometrial vascularity in the ipsilateral horn first increased (P<0.05) between days 18 and 20. Day 20 is the reported day of adhesiveness between chorion and uterus. An increase (P<0.05) in the contralateral horn between days 18 and 22 was slight, but a greater increase occurred after day 32. Day 32 is the reported day of entry of the allantochorion into the contralateral horn. By day 42, scores were similar between the two horns, and the allantochorion reportedly fills both horns. On days 42-60, at a time when placentomes apparently are limited to the ipsilateral horn, vascularity remained elevated in the ipsilateral horn but decreased in the contralateral horn. Results support the hypothesis that vascular perfusion in each uterine horn during early pregnancy is mediated by direct contact between conceptus and uterus. 3aadhesion 3ablood flow 3achorion 3aconceptus 3adirect contact 3aendometrium 3aestradiol 3aheifers 3ahorns 3apregnancy 3aprogesterone 3aultrasonography 2aAnimals 2aBlood Flow Velocity 2aCattle 2aEmbryo Implantation 2aEndometriumxblood supply 2aEstradiolxblood 2aFemale 2aGestational Age 2aNeovascularization, Physiologic 2aOvulation 2aPregnancy 2aProgesteronexblood 2aRegional Blood Flow 2aUltrasonography, Doppler, Color 2aUltrasonography, Prenatalxmethods 2aUterusxblood supplyxultrasonography. 2aVascular Resistance1 aGinther, O.J.0 tReproduction.g2010 Feb., v. 139, no. 2 p.453-463dBioScientifica Ltdx1470-16267nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1530/REP-09-03633Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03960naa a2200673 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002900111040001800140100003100158245017000189300001600359500002400375520174000399650001402139650001202153650001602165650002302181650002602204650003302230650002402263650001102287650000902298650002002307650001102327650001202338650002802350650001202378650003202390650003702422650003502459650006202494650003902556650002402595650004002619650004302659650003102702650000902733650000902742650002202751650003402773650007102807650003102878650001702909700002302926700002302949700001702972700002102989700002203010700001703032700002103049700002503070773009103095852000903186856007903195655001203274IND4432076220221119051134.0100129s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443207622DNAL7 a199037172pmid7 a10.1530/REP-09-02262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aĀlama, Mohāmmada Śāha.10aInduction of spermatogenic cell apoptosis in prepubertal rat testes irrespective of testicular steroidogenesis: a possible estrogenic effect of di(n-butyl) phthalate  ap. 427-437.  aIncludes references  aAlthough di(n-butyl) phthalate (DBP), a suspected endocrine disruptor, induces testicular atrophy in prepubertal male rats, whether it exerts estrogenic activity in vivo remains a matter of debate. In the present study, we explored the estrogenic potency of DBP using 3-week-old male rats, and then examined the relationship between estrogen-induced spermatogenic cell apoptosis and testicular steroidogenesis. Daily exposure to DBP for 7 days caused testicular atrophy due to loss of spermatogenic cells, whereas testicular steroidogenesis was almost the same with the control values. A single exposure of DBP decreased testicular steroidogenesis in addition to decreasing the level of serum LH at 3 h after DBP treatment, with an extremely high incidence of apoptotic spermatogenic cells at 6 h after administration. To elucidate the estrogenic activity of DBP, we carried out an inhibition study using pure antiestrogen ICI 182,780 (ICI) in a model of spermatogenic cell apoptosis induced by DBP or estradial-3-benzoate (EB). Although both the DBP- and EB-treated groups showed a significant increase in spermatogenic cell apoptosis, ICI pretreatment significantly decreased the number of apoptotic spermatogenic cells in these two groups. In contrast, testicular steroidogenesis and serum FSH were significantly reduced in all the treated groups, even in the DBP+ICI and EB+ICI groups. Taken together, these findings led us to conclude that estrogenic compounds such as DBP and EB induce spermatogenic cell apoptosis in prepubertal rats, probably by activating estrogen receptors in testis, and that reduction in testicular steroidogenic function induced by estrogenic compounds is not associated with spermatogenic cell apoptosis. 3aapoptosis 3aatrophy 3ablood serum 3aestrogen receptors 3aestrogenic properties 3afollicle-stimulating hormone 3aluteinizing hormone 3amodels 3arats 3asteroidogenesis 3atestes 2aAnimals 2aApoptosisxdrug effects 2aAtrophy 2aDibutyl Phthalatextoxicity 2aDose-Response Relationship, Drug 2aEndocrine Disruptorsxtoxicity 2aEstradiolxanalogs & derivativesxpharmacologyxtoxicity. 2aEstrogen Antagonistsxpharmacology 2aEstrogensxtoxicity 2aFollicle Stimulating Hormonexblood 2aLeydig Cellsxdrug effectsxpathology. 2aLuteinizing Hormonexblood 2aMale 2aRats 2aSexual Maturation 2aSpermatogenesisxdrug effects 2aTestisxdrug effectsxgrowth & developmentxmetabolismxpathology. 2aTestosteronexbiosynthesis 2aTime Factors1 aOhsako, Seiichiroh1 aMatsuwaki, Takashi1 aZhu, Xiao Bo1 aTsunekawa, Naoki1 aKanai, Yoshiakira1 aSone, Hideko1 aTohyama, Chiharu1 aKurohmaru, Masamichi0 tReproduction.g2010 Feb., v. 139, no. 2 p.427-437dBioScientifica Ltdx1470-16267nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1530/REP-09-02263Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02304naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002900111040001800140100002100158245005400179300001600233500002400249520088500273650003001158650003901188650002601227650001301253650001401266650001701280650001001297650003801307650002301345650001101368650006101379650000901440650001401449650003101463650002001494650001701514650001601531650001901547650003001566650002701596700002001623773009101643852000901734856007901743655001201822IND4432075020221119050747.0100129s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443207502DNAL7 a197760972pmid7 a10.1530/REP-09-02292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVisser, Liesbeth10aUnravelling the genetics of spermatogenic failure  ap. 303-307.  aIncludes references  aSubfertility, defined as the inability to conceive within 1 year of unprotected intercourse, affects 10-15% of couples. In up to 55% of couples, the male partner is diagnosed with spermatogenic failure, i.e. one or more semen parameters fall below the WHO criteria for normozoospermia. In these cases, assisted reproductive technology is usually used to achieve pregnancy. Both genetic and environmental factors are thought to underlie spermatogenic failure. Despite years of research, only few genetic factors have clearly been shown to cause spermatogenic failure, and the identification of additional genetic causes or risk factors has proven to be extremely difficult. In this review, we will present an overview of established genetic causes of spermatogenic failure, describe pitfalls in searching for novel genetic factors and discuss research opportunities for the future. 3aWorld Health Organization 3aassisted reproductive technologies 3aenvironmental factors 3agenetics 3apregnancy 3arisk factors 3asemen 2aGenetic Predisposition to Disease 2aGenetic Techniques 2aHumans 2aInfertility, Malexgeneticsxpathologyxphysiopathology. 2aMale 2aPhenotype 2aReproducibility of Results 2aRisk Assessment 2aRisk Factors 2aSperm Count 2aSperm Motility 2aSpermatogenesisxgenetics 2aSpermatozoaxpathology1 aRepping, Sjoerd0 tReproduction.g2010 Feb., v. 139, no. 2 p.303-307dBioScientifica Ltdx1470-16267nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1530/REP-09-02293Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle04516naa a2200697 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002300094024003800117040001800155100002300173245020600196300001800402520233300420650004302753650001202796650001702808650001102825650001302836650001602849650001602865650001102881650001802892650001002910650001902920650001602939650002502955650001202980650001802992650000703010650001103017650000903028650002003037650001203057650001103069650002203080650001903102650001203121650001703133650001403150651001803164700002003182700001803202700002003220700002003240700002003260700002003280700002003300700002103320700002303341700002203364700001903386700002403405700002703429773017603456856005103632856011403683852000903797655001203806IND60655851320221119050615.0190807e20190625xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065585132DNAL7 a10113/65585132hdl7 a10.4315/0362-028X.JFP-18-4532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLuchansky, John B.10aMeat Bars: A Survey To Assess Consumer Familiarity and Preparation Parameters and a Challenge Study To Quantify Viability of Shiga Toxin–Producing Escherichia coli Cells during Processing and Storage  ap. 1249-1264.  aMeat bars are dried snacks containing a mixture of meat, berries, and nuts. To explore consumer awareness of meat bars, we conducted two online, nationally representative surveys and established that 70.8% (743 of 1,050) of U.S. citizens were unfamiliar with this product. When asked to check all answers that applied, most of the 545 respondents (who were recruited based on their familiarity with meat bars) preferred beef (n = 385) as the protein source, followed by chicken (n = 293), pork (n = 183), and turkey (n = 179). Most meat bars were purchased from grocery stores (n = 447), followed by online orders (n = 130) and outdoor stores (n = 120). When asked specifically whether they made their own meat bars, 17.8% of respondents (97 of 545) replied “yes,” the majority (52 of 97, 54%) of which obtained recipes online. Some 69.1% (67 of 97) measured the internal temperature of the meat during dehydration, but only 10.3% (10 of 97) confirmed the internal temperature by using a thermometer. Given the paucity of information available on the fate of pathogenic or spoilage bacteria associated with meat bars, as another component of this study, batter was prepared with or without encapsulated citric acid (ECA; 0.74%) added to a formulation of ground beef (65%; 90% lean, 10% fat), chopped pecans (15%), golden flaxseed flour (9.7%), chopped cranberries (5.0%), chopped sunflower seeds (3.1%), sea salt (1.1%), black pepper (0.8%), and celery powder (0.35%). Batter was inoculated (ca. 6.5 log CFU/g) with Shiga toxin–producing Escherichia coli (STEC), portioned by hand (40 ± 0.1 g each), and then dried in a commercial dehydrator. Regardless of the drying treatment, inclusion of ECA in the batter resulted in a pH decrease from ca. 5.5 to ca. 4.7 to 5.0 in the finished product. Without ECA, when meat bars were dried at 62.8°C for 6 h, 71.1°C for 4 h, or 62.8°C for 2 h and then 71.1°C for 2 h, levels of STEC decreased by ca. 6.2, 6.3, or 5.2 log CFU/g, respectively. With ECA, STEC decreased by ca. 6.0, 6.6, or 6.0 log CFU/g in meat bars dried at 62.8°C for 6 h, 71.1°C for 4 h, or 62.8°C for 2 h and then 71.1°C for 2 h, respectively.

The model is used to analyze the impact of trade costs on food and agricultural trade based on a bilateral trade dataset covering 159 countries over the period 2010--2013. The results show that a high firm capability cutoff---implying an ability to produce high quality---limits export market entry. In addition, fixed and variable trade costs have a negative and significant impact on the probability of firms entering export markets, while variable trade costs have a negative and significant effect on firms' export levels. 3aagricultural trade 3adata collection 3aexports 3amarkets 3amodels 3aprobability 3aproduct quality1 aSheldon, Ian1 aThompson, Stanley R.0 tJournal of agricultural and resource economics.g2021 Jan., v. 46, no. 1 p.1-19dWestern Agricultural Economics AssociationwJournal:jnl48977x1068-55027nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.22004/ag.econ.30360240uhttp://handle.usda.gov/10.13031/7370241  aDNAL 7aarticle01827naa a2200421 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024001800097040001800115100001700133245007200150300001800222520054400240650001900784650002400803650002300827650002300850650001600873650002500889650002500914650005700939650003000996650001401026650003201040650001101072650002501083650002101108650001801129650004701147650001601194651001801210653001801228773010501246939003301351852000901384655001201393991583362690742620221119051026.0911107e199110  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI910033762DNAL7 a19187462pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBegley, C.E.10aGovernment should strengthen regulation in the weight loss industry  ap. 1255-1257.  aRationales for government regulation in the weight loss industry are developed on the basis of the concepts of market failure and potential harm to consumers.

Plants of all ages, floating on nutrient solution, are present in the greenhouse at any time. They move from the starting point to the harvest point in 24 days, all under the same environmental conditions, repeated day after day throughout the year. The key to the success of such an operation is a constant daily light integral, which can be achieved only through shading and supplemental lighting. Since the potential loss of yield from insufficient lighting (in winter) and the damage from leaf tip burn (LTB) from excessive light (in summer) are high, a rather tight light control is required, which is currently achieved with a rule-based strategy labelled C. A new strategy N, which tracks a reference light trajectory, is now introduced and compared, via simulation, with strategy C, as well as with a reference strategy R, which assumes the availability of a perfect 1-day-ahead forecast of total daily solar radiation. The results show that all strategies are rather robust to variation among years and among locations (within the US). Strategy N out-performs strategy C on average by about 7 $ m-2 yr-1 and does almost as well as strategy R (1 $ m-2 yr-1 difference). All strategies utilise at least some of the economic information contained in the performance criterion, with strategy N more than the others. The application of strategy N to sizing of the control equipment and to systems with insufficient equipment capacity, is demonstrated. 3asimulation models 3aequations 3ageographical variation 3acosts and returns 3alight requirement 3aclimatic factors 3ashade 3acrop yield 3alatitude 3aphotoyellowing 3alettuce 3aplant damage 3alight 3agreenhouses 3aNew York 0acrop production 0aleaf tip burn 0alight control strategies1 aAlbright, L.D.1 aIoslovich, I.0 tBiosystems engineering.g2006 Jan., v. 93, no. 1 p.69-80dAcademic Pressx1537-51107nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.sciencedirect.com/science/journal/153751103Available from publisher's Web site  a20080523b20080606c00000000  aINDdLYNe2007/04/06  aNon-US 7aarticle03583naa a2200649 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024002700133040001800160100002300178245008300201300001600284500002400300506007600324520152800400506003701928650001401965650001101979650001401990650004302004650001302047650002202060650000902082650000902091650001902100650002002119650001902139650005302158650004002211650001102251650003702262650001102299650003102310650004102341650002902382650000902411650003102420650001602451650004002467650002402507650001702531650002602548651001602574651003102590700001802621700003102639700002302670700002002693700002002713773010202733852000902835856007702844655001202921IND4432061920221207051909.0100129s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443206192DNAL7 a199180152pmid7 aPMC28092742pmcid7 a10.2337/dc09-13802doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLandman, Gijs W.D.10aMetformin Associated With Lower Cancer Mortality in Type 2 Diabetes: ZODIAC-16  ap. 322-326.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aOBJECTIVE: Several studies have suggested an association between specific diabetes treatment and cancer mortality. We studied the association between metformin use and cancer mortality in a prospectively followed cohort. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: In 1998 and 1999, 1,353 patients with type 2 diabetes were enrolled in the Zwolle Outpatient Diabetes project Integrating Available Care (ZODIAC) study in the Netherlands. Vital status was assessed in January 2009. Cancer mortality rate was evaluated using standardized mortality ratios (SMRs), and the association between metformin use and cancer mortality was evaluated with a Cox proportional hazards model, taking possible confounders into account. RESULTS: Median follow-up time was 9.6 years, average age at baseline was 68 years, and average A1C was 7.5%. Of the patients, 570 died, of which 122 died of malignancies. The SMR for cancer mortality was 1.47 (95% CI 1.22-1.76). In patients taking metformin compared with patients not taking metformin at baseline, the adjusted hazard ratio (HR) for cancer mortality was 0.43 (95% CI 0.23-0.80), and the HR with every increase of 1 g of metformin was 0.58 (95% CI 0.36-0.93). CONCLUSIONS: In general, patients with type 2 diabetes are at increased risk for cancer mortality. In our group, metformin use was associated with lower cancer mortality compared with nonuse of metformin. Although the design cannot provide a conclusion about causality, our results suggest a protective effect of metformin on cancer mortality.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3ametformin 3amodels 3amortality 3anoninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 3apatients 3aprotective effect 3arisk 2aAged 2aBlood Pressure 2aBody Mass Index 2aCohort Studies 2aDiabetes Mellitus, Type 2xbloodxcomplications. 2aDiabetic Angiopathiesxepidemiology 2aFemale 2aGlycated Hemoglobinxmetabolism. 2aHumans 2aHypertensionxepidemiology 2aHypoglycemic Agentsxtherapeutic use 2aInsulinxtherapeutic use 2aMale 2aMetforminxtherapeutic use 2aMiddle Aged 2aNeoplasmsxepidemiologyxmortality. 2aProspective Studies 2aRisk Factors 2aSmokingxepidemiology 3aNetherlands 0aNetherlandsxepidemiology.1 aKleefstra, N.1 avan Hateren, Kornelis J.J.1 aGroenier, Klaas H.1 aGans, Rijk O.B.1 aBilo, Henk J.G.0 tDiabetes care.g2010 Feb., v. 33, no. 2 p.322-326dAmerican Diabetes Associationx0149-59927nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2337/dc09-13803Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle04527naa a2200877 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024002700133040001800160100002100178245018000199300001600379500002400395506007600419520186000495506003702355650001402392650001102406650001502417650001802432650002002450650001302470650002902483650001202512650001202524650004102536650001202577650001402589650001802603650000802621650001202629650002402641650000902665650002802674650001502702650002102717650002402738650001002762650001002772650002802782650002002810650002802830650004702858650004402905650001302949650001202962650001102974650004102985650001103026650003903037650001503076650001803091650000903109650001603118650003703134650002403171650002403195650001503219650002503234650002403259651002903283700002403312700001803336700001503354700001603369700002203385700002003407700002203427773010203449852000903551856007703560655001203637IND4432062020221207051923.0100129s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443206202DNAL7 a199180032pmid7 aPMC28092752pmcid7 a10.2337/dc09-04932doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aThorp, Alicia A.10aDeleterious Associations of Sitting Time and Television Viewing Time With Cardiometabolic Risk Biomarkers: Australian Diabetes, Obesity and Lifestyle (AusDiab) study 2004-2005  ap. 327-334.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aOBJECTIVE: We examined the associations of sitting time and television (TV) viewing time with continuously measured biomarkers of cardio-metabolic risk in Australian adults. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Waist circumference, BMI, resting blood pressure, triglycerides, HDL cholesterol, fasting and 2-h postload plasma glucose, and fasting insulin were measured in 2,761 women and 2,103 men aged ≥30 years (mean age 54 years) without clinically diagnosed diabetes from the 2004-2005 Australian Diabetes, Obesity and Lifestyle (AusDiab) study. Multivariate linear regression analyses examined associations of self-reported sitting time and TV viewing time (hours per day) with these biomarkers, adjusting for potential confounding variables. RESULTS: For both women and men, sitting time was detrimentally associated with waist circumference, BMI, systolic blood pressure, fasting triglycerides, HDL cholesterol, 2-h postload plasma glucose, and fasting insulin (all P < 0.05), but not with fasting plasma glucose and diastolic blood pressure (men only). With the exception of HDL cholesterol and systolic blood pressure in women, the associations remained significant after further adjustment for waist circumference. TV viewing time was detrimentally associated with all metabolic measures in women and all except HDL cholesterol and blood pressure in men. Only fasting insulin and glucose (men only) remained deleteriously associated with TV viewing time after adjustment for waist circumference. CONCLUSIONS: In women and men, sitting time and TV viewing time were deleteriously associated with cardio-metabolic risk biomarkers, with sitting time having more consistent associations in both sexes and being independent of central adiposity. Preventive initiatives aimed at reducing sitting time should focus on both nonleisure and leisure-time domains.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aadiposity 3aadults 3abiomarkers 3ablood glucose 3abody mass index 3adiabetes 3adiastolic blood pressure 3afasting 3aglucose 3ahigh density lipoprotein cholesterol 3ainsulin 3alifestyle 3alinear models 3amen 3aobesity 3aregression analysis 3arisk 3asystolic blood pressure 3atelevision 3atriacylglycerols 3awaist circumference 3awomen 2aAdult 2aBlood Glucosexanalysis 2aBody Mass Index 2aCholesterol, HDLxblood 2aDiabetes Mellitusxepidemiologyxgenetics. 2aEmploymentxstatistics & numerical data 2aExercise 2aFasting 2aFemale 2aHeart Diseasesxbloodxepidemiology. 2aHumans 2aLeisure Activitiesxclassification 2aLife Style 2aLipidsxblood 2aMale 2aMiddle Aged 2aObesityxepidemiologyxetiology. 2aSedentary Behavior. 2aSystolexphysiology 2aTelevision 2aTriglyceridesxblood 2aWaist Circumference 0aAustraliaxepidemiology.1 aHealy, Genevieve N.1 aOwen, Neville1 aSalmon, Jo1 aBall, Kylie1 aShaw, Jonathan E.1 aZimmet, Paul Z.1 aDunstan, David W.0 tDiabetes care.g2010 Feb., v. 33, no. 2 p.327-334dAmerican Diabetes Associationx0149-59927nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2337/dc09-04933Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle00761naa a2200217 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100001300115245001500128300001900143520018400162650001900346650002000365650001600385773008800401939003300489852000900522655001200531991583361260742620221119050817.0911101e199109  xx ||||go|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI910033152DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWebb, D.10aFood facts  ap. 20, 22, 57.  aAdditives and preservatives are included in foods to provide better flavor, brighter color and longer shelf life.

It has been possible to validate laboratory-scale results (40 g of particles) by studying the feasibility and advantages of a PEF-assisted cold pressing of sugar beet cossettes on a much larger scale (4·5-15 kg). A best scheme scenario for an adequate PEF-assisted cold pressing of sugar beet cossettes consists of two initial pressing steps with an intermediate PEF treatment, followed by one or more washing steps and a final pulp pressing. A yield of about 80% in juice per initial mass of cossettes has been achieved before washing. By performing some washing and final pressing operations, losses of sugar in pulp could be significantly reduced to about 3% of the initial sugar content. The purity of pressed juices was systematically higher following PEF treatment compared to that of juices prior to PEF treatment (96-98% and 90-93%, respectively). Spectrophotometric colour measurements, reflecting impurities and fine suspended particles contents in juices, showed that purified PEF juices had colour values three to four times lower than those of purified factory juices, a difference confirmed by the colour of sugar crystals obtained from both types of juices. In addition, significant amounts of potassium, sodium and *-amino nitrogen were found to remain in PEF-treated particles, which explains why better purity juices are obtained following PEF treatment. 3aspectrophotometers 3aelectric field 3asugar beet 3ajuices 3apurity 3afood quality 3afood processing 3apulsed electric fields 3anonthermal processing 3aextraction 3aspectral analysis 0aprocessing technology 0anew technology 0amethodology 0anew methods 0atechnology1 aVorobiev, E.0 tBiosystems engineering.g2006 Jan., v. 93, no. 1 p.57-68dAcademic Pressx1537-51107nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.sciencedirect.com/science/journal/153751103Available from publisher's Web site  a20080523b20080606c00000000  aINDdLYNe2007/04/06  aNon-US 7aarticle01021naa a2200325 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100001500115245006500130300001300195500001500208520015900223650001300382650001100395650001400406650002300420650002400443650002100467650001700488650002300505653000900528773008300537852000900620939003300629945000800662946001300670655001200683991583360360742620221119050959.0911101e199002  xx ||||go|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI910033252DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLevine, E.10aIf longevity is the goal, better nutrition may be the answer  ap. 1, 3.  a2019-12-04  aGood nutrition may increase longevity.

To test whether there is a specific propensity of these tissues to generate splicing variants, we used a single source of high-density microarray data to perform both splicing factor and exon expression profiling across 11 normal human tissues. Paired comparisons between tissues and an original exon-based statistical group analysis demonstrated after extensive RT-PCR validation that the cerebellum, testis, and spleen had the largest proportion of differentially expressed alternative exons. Variations at the exon level correlated with a larger number of splicing factors being expressed at a high level in the cerebellum, testis and spleen than in other tissues. However, this splicing factor expression profile was similar to a more global gene expression pattern as a larger number of genes had a high expression level in the cerebellum, testis and spleen. In addition to providing a unique resource on expression profiling of alternative splicing variants and splicing factors across human tissues, this study demonstrates that the higher prevalence of alternative splicing in a subset of tissues originates from the larger number of genes, including splicing factors, being expressed than in other tissues.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aalternative splicing 3ahumans 3amicroarray technology 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3aspleen 3acerebellum 3anucleic acids 3atestes 3aexons 3atissues 0agenes1 aGratadou, Lise1 aDelord, Marc1 aDutertre, Martin1 aAuboeuf, Didier0 tNucleic acids research.g2010 May, v. 38, no. 9 p.2825-2838x0305-10487nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkq0083Available from publisher's Web site  a20100522b20100605c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01798naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110100001600127245010700143300001800250520085900268650001701127650001301144650000801157650001301165650002401178650001901202650002001221700001301241700001401254700001601268773008401284852000901368930003301377945002501410946001301435655001201448IND4375590220221119050807.0051028e200509  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437559022DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

E437-E442.  aA novel technique, using an X-ray micro-computed tomography system (X-ray micro-CT system) has been developed for visualization of the two- (2-D) and three-dimensional (3-D) ice crystal structures formed during freezing. The system reconstructs all 3-D images based on a set of 2-D images obtained by multiple slicing of an X-ray shadow image. This study demonstrates the capability of the technique to characterize the ice crystal microstructure of mycoprotein products after freezing. Results are presented for the 2-D ice crystals formed within mycoprotein frozen at different rates. The method requires freeze-drying of the sample to remove frozen water before scanning to indicate ice crystal and internal structure of the material at a depth of 1 cm. The dendrite spacing of ice crystals has been related to the freezing conditions of the material. 3afrozen foods 3afreezing 3aice 3acrystals 3acomputed tomography 3aultrastructure 3afungal proteins1 aMiri, T.1 aCox, P.W.1 aFryer, P.J.0 tJournal of food science.g2005 Sept., v. 70, no. 7 p.E437-E442x0022-11477nnas  aDNAL  a20060914b20061003c00000000  aINDd2CTe2005/11/29  aOther US 7aarticle02153naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110100002100127245008600148300001800234520094000252650001601192650001401208650001901222650001501241650001901256650002301275650002801298650002201326650001901348650001301367650002401380650001601404650002201420653003501442700001601477700001701493700001701510700001601527773008401543852000901627930003301636945002501669946001301694655001201707IND4375591220221119050701.0051028e200509  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437559122DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

The bacterial load and thermal lag time were similar (alpha = 0.05) for both whole and ground muscle; therefore, all samples had equivalent composition, inoculation levels, and thermal histories. Assuming 1st-order kinetics, the inactivation rate constants (k values) in whole muscle were 50% lower than those in ground product at each temperature (P = 0.0001), and Arrhenius-type models described the temperature dependency of k (R2 > 0.95). Because thermal processing regulations are generally based on ground product studies, thermal process validations for meat and poultry products may need to consider the physical state (whole-muscle versus ground) of the product being manufactured. 3aground beef 3ameat cuts 3afood pathogens 3aSalmonella 3aheat tolerance 3afood contamination 3abacterial contamination 3aheat inactivation 3aheat treatment 3akinetics 3amathematical models 3asterilizing 3aspatial variation 0aphysical form of meat products1 aMarks, B.P.1 aWarsow, C.R.1 aBooren, A.M.1 aRyser, E.T.0 tJournal of food science.g2005 Sept., v. 70, no. 7 p.M359-M362x0022-11477nnas  aDNAL  a20060914b20061003c00000000  aINDd2CTe2005/11/29  aOther US 7aarticle02295naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130100001600148245021500164300001800379500002400397520109600421650001301517650001101530650002001541650001601561650001401577650001101591650001801602650001201620650001601632650003001648650001501678650001101693700002001704773010001724852000901824856008801833655001201921IND4432339720221119050724.0100205s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443233972DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chroma.2009.12.0712doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBhushan, R.10aDifferent approaches of impregnation for resolution of enantiomers of atenolol, propranolol and salbutamol using Cu(II)-l-amino acid complexes for ligand exchange on commercial thin layer chromatographic plates  ap. 1395-1398.  aIncludes references  aAtenolol and propranolol (the β-blocking agents) and salbutamol (broncho- and vasodilator) were resolved into their enantiomers by adopting different modes of loading/impregnating the Cu(II) complexes of l-proline (l-Pro), l-phenylalanine (l-Phe), l-histidine (l-His), N,N-dimethyl-l-phenylalanine (N,N-Me₂-l-Phe), and l-tryptophan (l-Trp) on commercial precoated normal phase plates. The three different approaches were (A) using the Cu(II)-l-amino acid complex as chiral mobile phase additive, (B) ascending development of plain commercial plates in the solutions of Cu complex, and (C) using a solution of Cu(II) acetate as mobile phase additive for the commercial TLC plates impregnated with ascending development of plates in the solutions of amino acid. Spots were located using iodine vapour. The results obtained for the three methods have been compared for their efficiency and the issue of involvement of the Cu(II) cation for the best performance of the three methods has been discussed with respect to the same mobile phase.

This paper describes the design, construction, and testing of an alternative tool to whole-tree enclosures for measuring pollution response in mature woody tissue. The chamber is a new design, though not a new concept, and is referred to as a branch exposure chamber. Designed primarily for ozone and acid precipitation exposures (and used additionally for CO2 measurements), the branch exposure chamber incorporates four major parts: support structure, fan-air supply unit, charcoal filter unit, and exposure chamber. The exposure chamber is a 1.5-m long by 0.7-m diam. cylinder. The chamber is constructed of Teflon sheeting stretched over an aluminum frame; the aluminum frame is totally wrapped with nonreactive, aluminum-backed Teflon tape. Three zones in the chamber affect exposure of the experimental tissue: an initial buffer region for mixing, a main exposure region, and an exhaust frustrum. Aerodynamic testing of the chamber-mixing characteristics show that mixing is uniform and complete within the main exposure region. Thermal buildup within the chamber was a maximum of 3 degrees C under a wide range of ambient meteorological conditions. Based on current field trials of the chamber, material deterioration due to environmental variables (e.g., ultraviolet radiation, heat oxidants), is not expected to affect operation of the chamber for 24 mo. The BEC is inexpensive to build and operate, and represents a viable alternative to a whole-tree chamber. 3aPinus ponderosa 3abranches 3amaturity stage 3agrowth chambers 3adesign 3aacid deposition 3aozone 3ameasurement 3astress response1 aCostella, M.P.1 aCowles, S.0 tJournal of environmental quality.g1991 , v. 20, no. 2 p.467-474wJournal:jnl1642x0047-24257nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02857naa a2200289 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001900110245009500129300001600224520199600240650002202236650002302258650002002281650002102301650001902322650001902341700002002360700001702380773010302397852000902500939003302509946001302542655001202555IND9104609320221119050903.0911121e199104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND910460932DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAnderson, T.A.10aFate of volatile and semivolatile organic chemicals in soils: abiotic versus biotic losses  ap. 420-424.  aDisappearance of 15 volatile and semivolatile organic compounds was determined in a mixture added to two different soil types, a Captina silt loam (Typic Fragiudult) and McLaurin sandy loam (Typic Paleudults) using experimental procedures to distinguish abiotic losses from biological degradation over a 7-d period. Losses due to volatilization were quantified and mass balances were calculated for each compound. Standard USEPA and National Institute of Occupational Health and Safety (NIOHS) methods were used for sample handling storage, and analysis. The compounds (methyl ethyl ketone; tetrahydrofuran; chlorobenzene, benzene; chloroform; carbon tetrachloride, p-xylene; 1,2-dichlorobenzene; cis-1,4-dichloro-2-butene; 1,2,3-trichloropropane; 2-chloronaphthalene; ethylene dibromide; hexachlorobenzene; nitrobenzene; and toluene) were applied to the soil in a mixture such that the concentration of each chemical was 100 mg/kg soil (dry wt.). The headspace of the soil samples and matched sterile (autoclaved) controls, which were incubated in the dark at 20 degrees C in stoppered jars fitted with charcoal traps, was flushed daily to maintain aerobic conditions and to trap vapors. Apparent half-lives for the 15 organic compounds ranged from <2 to 11.3 d and showed good agreement with published values in the few instances where they were available. Rapid disappearance due to abiotic factors was observed for all chemicals during the 7-d period. Although short-term spike and recovery analyses yielded consistently reproducible recovery for all compounds, careful attempts to account for all losses, including the use of 14C-toluene, were unsuccessful. Nonreversible sorption and preanalysis storage conditions were considered as contributors to this inability to achieve a mass balance. On the basis of these results, we strongly advise positive accounting for all test compounds and degradation products at the conclusion of studies involving volatile and semivolatile compounds. 3aorganic compounds 3avolatile compounds 3asilt loam soils 3asandy loam soils 3abiodegradation 3avolatilization1 aBeauchamp, J.J.1 aWalton, B.T.0 tJournal of environmental quality.g1991 , v. 20, no. 2 p.420-424wJournal:jnl1642x0047-24257nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle04128naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024003800133040001800171072001700189100001900206245015300225506007600378520222800454506003702682650002402719650002402743650001702767650001602784650002202800650002502822650002002847650002102867650002102888650001202909650004902921650004502970650001103015650001403026650001103040650001803051650002303069650004203092650001703134650002403151650006203175651001203237651001803249700002603267700002203293773005503315852000903370856008803379930003303467945002503500946001303525655001203538IND4427356220221207072024.0091015e200904  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442735622DNAL7 a194017552pmid7 aPMC26604232pmcid7 a10.1371/journal.pone.00050162doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aBöhm, Monika.10aContact Networks in a Wildlife-Livestock Host Community: Identifying High-Risk Individuals in the Transmission of Bovine TB among Badgers and Cattle  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBackground: The management of many pathogens, which are of concern to humans and their livestock, is complicated by the pathogens' ability to cross-infect multiple host species, including wildlife. This has major implications for the management of such diseases, since the dynamics of infection are dependent on the rates of both intra- and inter-specific transmission. However, the difficulty of studying transmission networks in free-living populations means that the relative opportunities for intra- versus inter-specific disease transmission have not previously been demonstrated empirically within any wildlife-livestock disease system. Methodology/Principal Findings: Using recently-developed proximity data loggers, we quantify both intra-and inter-specific contacts in a wildlife-livestock disease system, using bovine tuberculosis (bTB) in badgers and cattle in the UK as our example. We assess the connectedness of individuals within the networks in order to identify whether there are certain ‘high-risk’ individuals or groups of individuals for disease transmission within and between species. Our results show that contact patterns in both badger and cattle populations vary widely, both between individuals and over time. We recorded only infrequent interactions between badger social groups, although all badgers fitted with data loggers were involved in these inter-group contacts. Contacts between badgers and cattle occurred more frequently than contacts between different badger groups. Moreover, these inter-specific contacts involved those individual cows, which were highly connected within the cattle herd. Conclusions/Significance: This work represents the first continuous time record of wildlife-host contacts for any free-living wildlife-livestock disease system. The results highlight the existence of specific individuals with relatively high contact rates in both livestock and wildlife populations, which have the potential to act as hubs in the spread of disease through complex contact networks. Targeting testing or preventive measures at high-contact groups and individuals within livestock populations would enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of disease management strategies.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aMycobacterium bovis 3abovine tuberculosis 3adairy cattle 3aMeles meles 3awildlife diseases 3adisease transmission 3arisk assessment 2aAnimal Husbandry 2aAnimal Migration 2aAnimals 2aAnimals, Domesticxmicrobiologyxphysiology. 2aAnimals, Wildxmicrobiologyxphysiology. 2aCattle 2aEcosystem 2aHumans 2aLinear Models 2aModels, Biological 2aMustelidaexmicrobiologyxphysiology. 2aRisk Factors 2aSpecies Specificity 2aTuberculosis, Bovinexprevention & controlxtransmission. 3aEngland 0aGreat Britain1 aHutchings, Michael R.1 aWhite, Piran C.L.0 tPloS one.g2009 Apr., v. 4, no. 4x1932-62037nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.00050163Available from publisher's Web site  a20100121b20100205c00000000  aINDdRHFe2010/01/20  aOther US 7aarticle
