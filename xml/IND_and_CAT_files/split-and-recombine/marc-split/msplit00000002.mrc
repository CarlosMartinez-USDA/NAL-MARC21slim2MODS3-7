However, the scant evidence available is not population-based, restricting the external validity of the findings. Our aim was to test associations between stressful life events, their accumulation, and the metabolic syndrome in a large population-based cohort. We also tested associations between stress and the individual components related to the metabolic syndrome. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This was a population-based, random sample of 3,407 women and men aged 18-78 years residing in Western Finland. Metabolic syndrome was defined according to the National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III and International Diabetes Federation criteria. The severity of 15 stressful life events pertaining to finance, work, social relationships, health, and housing was self-rated. RESULTS: In comparison with subjects not reporting any extremely stressful life events, those reporting work- or finance-related events had an increased odds for having the metabolic syndrome. The risk was further increased according to accumulation of stressful finance-related events and to having at least three stressful life events in any of the life domains assessed. Accumulation of stressful life events was associated with insulin resistance, obesity, and triglycerides. The associations were not confounded by sex, age, lifestyle, or family history of diabetes. CONCLUSIONS: Life events perceived as stressful, particularly those related to finance and work, may be a signal for poor metabolic health.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aadults 3adiabetes 3afunding 3ainsulin resistance 3alife events 3alifestyle 3amen 3ametabolic syndrome 3aobesity 3apathogenesis 3aprediction 3arisk 3atriacylglycerols 3awomen 2aAdolescent 2aAdult 2aAged 2aDiabetes Mellitusxbloodxclassificationxprevention & controlxpsychology. 2aFemale 2aGlucose Tolerance Test 2aHousing 2aHumans 2aInterpersonal Relations 2aMale 2aMetabolic Syndromexbloodxclassificationxpsychology. 2aMiddle Aged 2aStress, Psychologicalxepidemiologyxprevention & control. 2aWaist Circumference 3aFinland 0aFinland1 aRäikkönen, Katri1 aTuomi, Tiinamaija1 aEriksson, Johan G.1 aGroop, Leif1 aIsomaa, Bo0 tDiabetes care.g2010 Feb., v. 33, no. 2 p.378-384dAmerican Diabetes Associationx0149-59927nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2337/dc09-10273Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03670naa a2200685 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002900111040001800140100001800158245011700176300001600293500002400309520175800333650000802091650001302099650001402112650001302126650000902139650001802148650001602166650001102182650001702193650001302210650001302223650001102236650001202247650002002259650001502279650001802294650001602312650001302328650001102341650001202352650003902364650002002403650002002423650002402443650001102467650004602478650001702524650002302541650002502564650001102589650000902600650002802609650001402637650002702651650002802678650002002706650002802726700002302754700001602777773009102793852000902884856007902893655001202972IND4432074920221119050510.0100129s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443207492DNAL7 a197591742pmid7 a10.1530/REP-09-02812doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMiller, David10aPaternal DNA packaging in spermatozoa: more than the sum of its parts? DNA, histones, protamines and epigenetics  ap. 287-301.  aIncludes references  aHaploid male germ cells package their DNA into a volume that is typically 10% or less that of a somatic cell nucleus. To achieve this remarkable level of compaction, spermatozoa replace most of their histones with smaller, highly basic arginine and (in eutherians) cysteine rich protamines. One reason for such a high level of compaction is that it may help optimise nuclear shape and hence support the gametes' swimming ability for the long journey across the female reproductive tract to the oocyte. Super-compaction of the genome may confer additional protection from the effects of genotoxic factors. However, many species including the human retain a fraction of their chromatin in the more relaxed nucleosomal configuration that appears to run counter to the ergonomic, toroidal and repackaging of sperm DNA. Recent research suggests that the composition of this 'residual' nucleosomal compartment, a generally overlooked feature of the male gamete, is far more significant and important than previously thought. In this respect, the transport and incorporation of modified paternal histones by the spermatozoon to the zygote has been demonstrated and indicates another potential paternal effect in the epigenetic reprogramming of the zygote following fertilisation that is independent of imprinting status. In this review, the most recent research into mammalian spermatozoal chromatin composition is discussed alongside evidence for conserved, non-randomly located nucleosomal domains in spermatozoal nuclei, all supporting the hypothesis that the spermatozoon delivers a novel epigenetic signature to the egg that may be crucial for normal development. We also provide some thoughts on why this signature may be required in early embryogenesis. 3aDNA 3aarginine 3achromatin 3acysteine 3aeggs 3aembryogenesis 3aepigenetics 3agenome 3agenotoxicity 3ahaploidy 3ahistones 3ahumans 3aoocytes 3apaternal effect 3aprotamines 3asomatic cells 3aspermatozoa 3aswimming 3azygote 2aAnimals 2aChromatin Assembly and Disassembly 2aDNAxmetabolism 2aDNA Methylation 2aEpigenesis, Genetic 2aFemale 2aGene Expression Regulation, Developmental 2aGenetic Code 2aGenomic Imprinting 2aHistonesxmetabolism 2aHumans 2aMale 2aNucleosomesxmetabolism 2aPaternity 2aProtaminesxmetabolism 2aSperm-Ovum Interactions 2aSpermatogenesis 2aSpermatozoaxmetabolism1 aBrinkworth, Martin1 aIles, David0 tReproduction.g2010 Feb., v. 139, no. 2 p.287-301dBioScientifica Ltdx1470-16267nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1530/REP-09-02813Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03940naa a2200685 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024002700133040001800160100001900178245011800197300001600315500002400331506007600355520169200431506003702123650001402160650001602174650001402190650001902204650001702223650001402240650001802254650001702272650001302289650003902302650001402341650001402355650001802369650002402387650001402411650002102425650006202446650006202508650001902570650006702589650001102656650004502667650003102712650004802743650001402791650002102805700001902826700002502845700002102870700002302891700001902914700002102933700002302954700002002977700002102997700003603018773010203054852000903156856007703165655001203242IND4432062620221207070518.0100129s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443206262DNAL7 a198805842pmid7 aPMC28092812pmcid7 a10.2337/dc09-11412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aUccioli, Luigi10aProinflammatory Modulation of the Surface and Cytokine Phenotype of Monocytes in Patients With Acute Charcot Foot  ap. 350-355.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aOBJECTIVE: Despite increased information on the importance of an inappropriate inflammatory response in the acute Charcot process, there has been no previous attempt to define the specific pathways that mediate its pathogenesis. Here, the role played by monocytes was analyzed. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The immune phenotype of peripheral monocytes was studied by fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis comparing patients with acute Charcot (n = 10) in both the active and recovered phase, diabetic patients with neuropathy (with or without osteomyelitis), and normal control subjects. RESULTS: When compared with diabetic control subjects and healthy subjects, monocytes from acute Charcot patients showed a proinflammatory immune phenotype characterized by increased production of proinflammatory cytokines, reduced secretion of anti-inflammatory cytokines, increased expression of surface costimulatory molecules, and increased resistance to serum withdrawal-induced apoptosis. In addition, the pattern of circulating cytokines confirmed activation of proinflammatory cytokines. No modulation of the monocyte phenotype was documented in diabetic control subjects and healthy subjects, thus indicating that the proinflammatory alterations of monocytes are specific and causative of acute Charcot. CONCLUSIONS: Together, these data provide evidence for the role of proinflammatory changes in the immune phenotype of monocytes in the pathogenesis of acute Charcot. These alterations may explain the abnormally intense and prolonged inflammatory response that characterizes this disorder and may represent a potential therapeutic target for specific pharmacological interventions.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aapoptosis 3ablood serum 3acytokines 3aflow cytometry 3ainflammation 3amonocytes 3aosteomyelitis 3apathogenesis 3apatients 3aperipheral nervous system diseases 3aphenotype 3asecretion 2aAcute Disease 2aAntigens, CDxblood 2aApoptosis 2aCytokinesxblood 2aDiabetic Angiopathiesxbloodxpathologyxphysiopathology. 2aDiabetic Neuropathiesxbloodxpathologyxphysiopathology. 2aFlow Cytometry 2aGait Disorders, Neurologicxbloodxpathologyxphysiopathology. 2aHumans 2aInflammationxetiologyxphysiopathology. 2aMagnetic Resonance Imaging 2aMonocytesxcytologyxpathologyxphysiology. 2aPhenotype 2aReference Values1 aSinistro, Anna1 aAlmerighi, Cristiana1 aCiaprini, Chiara1 aCavazza, Antonella1 aGiurato, Laura1 aRuotolo, Valeria1 aSpasaro, Francesca1 aVainieri, Erika1 aRocchi, Giovanni1 aBergamini, Alberto,d1871-1962.0 tDiabetes care.g2010 Feb., v. 33, no. 2 p.350-355dAmerican Diabetes Associationx0149-59927nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2337/dc09-11413Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle01594naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002600145245010100171300001400272500001900286520068100305650001200986650001100998650002401009700002001033773016401053856004601217856004401263852000901307655001201316IND60737024520221119050624.0210513e202101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073702452DNAL7 a10.22004/ag.econ.3024642doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLakkakula, Prithviraj10aOrigin and Export Basis Interdependencies with Shipping Costs in Soybeans: A Panel Data Analysis  ap. 69-84.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aForward pricing and allocation mechanisms for rail transportation serve critical functions for the grain-marketing system. We examine the effects of shipping costs on the origin and export basis using a panel simultaneous-equations model. Results indicate that the origin and export basis are determined simultaneously, with each one affected by the dynamic variability of shipping costs. On average, a $1 increase for the shipping costs decreases the origin basis by $0.19 and increases the export basis by $0.82/bu of soybeans. The interaction between shipping cost and exports on the export basis impacts both marketing and trading strategies in the grain-marketing system. 3aexports 3amodels 3arail transportation1 aWilson, William0 tJournal of agricultural and resource economics.g2021 Jan., v. 46, no. 1 p.69-84dWestern Agricultural Economics AssociationwJournal:jnl48977x1068-55027nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.22004/ag.econ.30246440uhttp://handle.usda.gov/10.13031/7370245  aDNAL 7aarticle02797naa a2200493 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024001800097040001800115100001600133245005900149300001800208500002300226500001500249520132800264650001601592650000901608650001901617650001101636650002701647650001901674650001901693650002001712650001801732650002101750650001901771650001501790650001201805650006001817650006401877650001101941650003801952650006701990653002002057653002302077653001902100653001002119653001502129773010502144939003302249852000902282655001202291991583343790742620221119050717.0911108e199110  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI910033792DNAL7 a19187492pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAhmed, F.E.10aEffect of diet on progression of chronic renal disease  ap. 1266-1270.  aLiterature review.  a2019-12-04  aChanges in renal function induced by protein intake are thought to reflect evolutionary adaptation of the kidney. Excess dietary proteins over long periods may increase normal blood flow and glomerular filtration rate, requiring the continuous use of outer cortex's reserve glomeruli. According to the hyperfiltration theory pressures and flows in outer cortical glomeruli contribute to continuous intrarenal capillary hypertension and predispose healthy people to progressive glomerular sclerosis and deterioration of renal function. Pressures and flows associated with the response to renal disease in turn may accelerate the development of sclerosis, leading to even more rapid loss of renal function. Restriction of dietary protein (less than or equal to 0.6 g/kg per day) and/or phosphorus seems to slow the rate of loss of renal function in patients with chronic renal insufficiency. Evidence for the role of lipids in the progression of renal disease is not clear. All of these dietary factors possibly play a role in the progression of renal disease; the relative importance of each factor varies, depending on the pathogenesis, stage, and mechanism of progression of the disease. Findings indicate that nutrition therapy can decrease rate of deterioration of renal function in patients with chronic renal diseases. 3afatty acids 3adiet 3aquestionnaires 3ahumans 3aanimal experimentation 3arenal function 3aprotein intake 3akidney diseases 3abiofiltration 3alipid metabolism 3adisease course 3aphosphorus 2aAnimals 2aDietary Fatsxadministration & dosagexadverse effects. 2aDietary Proteinsxadministration & dosagexadverse effects. 2aHumans 2aKidney Failure, Chronicxetiology 2aPhosphorus, Dietaryxadministration & dosagexadverse effects. 0anutrient intake 0aliterature reviews 0aprotein excess 0aaging 0aglomerulus0 tJournal of the American Dietetic Association.g1991 Oct., v. 91, no. 10 p.1266-1270x0002-82237nnas  a00000000b00000000c00000000  aDNAL 7aarticle02101naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001900110245012300129300001600252520101600268650001001284650002001294650002201314650002601336650001701362650003701379650001201416650002501428650001301453653001101466653002301477700001601500700002001516700001401536700001401550773007301564852000901637930003301646945001301679946001101692655001201703IND2203485620221119051103.0000331e199908  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220348562DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStancekova, K.10aEffect of genetic variability of the porcine pituitary-specific transcription factor (PIT-1) on carcass traits in pigs  ap. 313-315.  aPituitary transcription factor (PIT-1) has been shown to be a positive regulatory factor of growth hormone, prolactin, and thyrotrophin-beta-subunit (TSH-beta) in the mammalian pituitary. Therefore, the gene encoding PIT-1 (POU1F1) was chosen as a candidate gene to investigate its association with growth and carcass traits in pigs. The purpose of this study was to analyse porcine POU1F1 genetic variability in populations of Large White and Large White x landrace pigs, by using PCR-RFLP analysis and to determine its possible associations with two carcass traits (backfat and percentage of lean content). Two different POU1F1-PCR-RFLP (POU1F1/RsaI and POU1F1/MspI) tests were applied to genomic DNA isolated from porcine blood (120 pigs) and hair roots (10 pigs). The present results clearly indicated that the MspI DD genotype was the fattest compared with both other genotypes (CC, CD) in analyzed swine population. For POU1F1/RsaI polymorphism no significance differences were seen for lean-to-fat ratio. 3aswine 3acarcass quality 3agenetic variation 3atranscription factors 3apolymorphism 3agenetic techniques and protocols 3abackfat 3agenetic polymorphism 3agenotype 0agrowth 0agenetic regulation1 aVasicek, D.1 aPeskovicova, D.1 aBulla, J.1 aKubek, A.0 tAnimal genetics.g1999 Aug., v. 30, no. 4 p.313-315x0268-91467nnas  aDNAL  a20000702b20000711c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle03154naa a2200697 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001400129245015500143300001600298500001500314520119000329650003901519650000901558650001101567650002501578650002301603650001001626650003101636650001001667650001201677650002501689650001101714650004201725650002301767650001101790650004001801650003201841650002401873650002001897653001601917653001901933653001901952653001901971653002801990653001902018653001902037653001602056653001902072653001902091653001902110653001902129653001902148653001802167700001402185700001502199700001602214700002302230700001602253700001902269700001702288773007302305852000902378930003302387945001302420946001102433655001202444IND2203484520221119051022.0000331e199908  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220348452DNAL7 a104677062pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSun, H.S.10aPhysical assignments of human chromosome 13 genes on pig chromosome 11 demonstrate extensive synteny and gene order conservation between pig and human  ap. 304-308.  a2019-12-05  aPrevious mapping between the human and pig genomes suggested extensive conservation of human chromosome 13 (HSA13) to pig chromosome 11 (SSC11). The objectives of this study were comparative gene mapping of pig homologs of HSA13 genes and examining gene order within this conserved synteny group by physical assignment of each locus. A detailed HSA13 to SSC11 comparison was chosen since the comparative gene map is not well developed for these chromosomes and a rearranged gene order within conserved synteny groups was observed from the comparison between HSA13 and bovine chromosome 12 (BTA12). Heterologous primers for PCR were designed and used to amplify pig homologous fragments. The pig fragments were sequenced to confirm the homology. Six pig STSs (FLT1, ESD, RB1, HTR2A, EDNRB, and F10) were physically mapped using a somatic cell hybrid panel to SSC11, and fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) mapping was also applied to improve map resolution and determine gene order. Results from this study increase the comparative information available on SSC11 and suggest a conserved gene order on SSC11 and HSA13, in contrast to human:bovine comparisons of this syntenic group. 3afluorescence in situ hybridization 3aloci 3ahumans 3acytogenetic analysis 3achromosome mapping 3agenes 3anucleic acid hybridization 3aswine 2aAnimals 2aBiological Evolution 2aCattle 2aChromosomes, Human, Pair 13xgenetics 2aGene Rearrangement 2aHumans 2aIn Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence 2aPhysical Chromosome Mapping 2aSpecies Specificity 2aSwinexgenetics 0acomparisons 0agenbank/g30675 0agenbank/g30674 0agenbank/g30677 0amolecular sequence data 0agenbank/g30678 0agenbank/g30925 0achromosomes 0agenbank/g32113 0agenbank/g32114 0agenbank/g32117 0agenbank/g30924 0agenbank/g32118 0agene location1 aYerle, M.1 aPinton, P.1 aChardon, P.1 aRogel-Gaillard, C.1 aLyons, L.A.1 aLaughlin, T.F.1 aTuggle, C.K.0 tAnimal genetics.g1999 Aug., v. 30, no. 4 p.304-308x0268-91467nnas  aDNAL  a20000602b20000608c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle03319naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100001600154245010200170300001600272500016700288520170200455650002602157650002102183650001902204650001902223650002102242650001502263650001002278650002202288650002502310650001602335650001702351650001402368650001802382650002302400650001302423650001702436650002202453650001802475650002302493650001402516650001102530650001902541650002102560650001002581773013702591856005502728961000902783852000902792655001202801IND60691651620221119051021.0200501s2019    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069165162DNAL7 a10.17660/ActaHortic.2019.1252.162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFeydeau, M.10aReduction of the environmental impact of the agronomic solutions of mulching and crops protection  ap. 115-120.  aPaper presented at the XXI International Congress on Plastics in Agriculture: Agriculture, Plastics and Environment held May 29-31, 1018 Bordeaux-Arcachon, France  aThe global use of agricultural plastic films, which includes films used for greenhouses, mulching, and silage, is expected to grow 69% from 4.4 million t in 2012 to 7.4 million t in 2019. This increase is due to benefits such as increase in soil temperature, reduced weed pressure, moisture conservation, reduction of certain insect pests, higher crop yields, earliness and more efficient use of soil nutrients. Today, many questions appear concerning the use of these plastic solutions in agriculture, mainly concerning their environmental effects. In this presentation, we aim at explaining the reduction of the impact of plastic solutions on the environment. First, as a major player in the recycling of used plastic films from household film, to industrial films and agricultural films, the manufacturing of high quality agricultural films using recycled materials has increased. Integrated in the circular economy, the use of post-consumption raw materials enables to produce in a more sustainable way. Furthermore, removal and recycling of some plastic solutions such as mulching films, with a low thickness, are very complicated due to a high contamination with soil and water. These used plastics are then difficult to recycle and to integrate in new products. They will be at some point forbidden for recycling and will be put in landfill. For polyethylene films in low thickness, alternatives are developed using biodegradable raw materials. The biodegradation of the films produced with biodegradable materials leads to carbon dioxide and water through microbial activity. These biodegradable materials are mainly applied as mulching film for different cultures and cultivation process. 3aagricultural plastics 3abiodegradability 3abiodegradation 3acarbon dioxide 3acircular economy 3acrop yield 3acrops 3aearly development 3aenvironmental impact 3agreenhouses 3ainsect pests 3alandfills 3amanufacturing 3amicrobial activity 3amulching 3anew products 3apolyethylene film 3araw materials 3arecycled materials 3arecycling 3asilage 3asoil nutrients 3asoil temperature 3aweeds0 tActa horticulturae.g2019, , no. 1252 p.115-120dInternational Society for Horticultural Science.wJournal:jnl46289x0567-75727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.17660/ActaHortic.2019.1252.16  aUSDA  aDNAL 7aarticle02662naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072000900110100001400119245010700133300001600240500002400256500001500280520115400295650001701449650001501466650001801481650002601499650002301525650001801548650002501566650002501591650001301616650003601629650001401665650001801679650001601697651001001713653001701723653002801740653002401768653002701792700001401819700001401833700001701847773010901864852000901973856009301982930003302075945002502108946001102133655001202144IND4378879820221119051134.0060317e200503  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437887982DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF6001 aSetha, S.10aQuantification of ABA and its metabolites in sweet cherries using deuterium-labeled internal standards  ap. 183-188.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aAbscisic acid (ABA), phaseic acid (PA), dihydrophaseic acid (DPA), and epi-dihydrophaseic acid (epi-DPA) were quantified in developing fruit and seeds of sweet cherry using each deuterium-labeled internal standard. ABA concentrations in the pulp were low at the early stage of fruit development, reached to the maximum before maturation, and subsequently declined during maturation. The significant increase of ABA after 29 days after full bloom (DAFB) coincides with the softening suggests that ABA may play a role to induce fruit maturation in sweet cherries. ABA metabolite levels were high at the immature stage and decreased with fruit maturation. This fact suggests that fruit may not need ABA in the early stage of fruit development. It was considered that DPA may be the major metabolite of ABA since the concentrations were higher than PA and epi-DPA at all stages of fruit development. ABA concentrations increased at the beginning of seed maturation and then decreased toward harvest. This decrease may be necessary to end seed dormancy. DPA in seeds changed similarly with ABA but its concentrations were always higher than those of ABA. 3aPrunus avium 3ametabolism 3aradionuclides 3aquantitative analysis 3achemical reactions 3aradiolabeling 3adevelopmental stages 3abiochemical pathways 3aripening 3achemical constituents of plants 3adeuterium 3aabscisic acid 3ametabolites 3aJapan 0aphaseic acid 0aepi-dihydrophaseic acid 0adihydrophaseic acid 0afruits (plant anatomy)1 aKondo, S.1 aHirai, N.1 aOhigashi, H.0 tPlant growth regulation.g2005 Mar., v. 45, no. 3 p.183-188dKluwer Academic Publishersx0167-69037nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.kluweronline.com/issn/0167-6903/contents3Available from publisher's Web site  a20080311b20080404c00000000  aINDdMKSe2006/05/18  aNon-US 7aarticle02663naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100001700154245006000171300001600231500030700247520123000554650002001784650002001804650001701824650001501841650002601856650000901882650001701891650001801908650001501926650001701941700001401958700001401972700001101986700001401997773014502011856005502156856004502211852000902256655001202265IND60765656220221119050645.0220201e20200623xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076565622DNAL7 a10.17660/ActaHortic.2020.1279.392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCoulombe, J.10aDetection of crop water status using UAV mounted sensor  ap. 271-278.  aPaper presented at the XXX International Horticultural Congress IHC2018: VII Conference on Landscape and Urban Horticulture, IV Conference on Turfgrass Management and Science for Sports Fields and II Symposium on Mechanization, Precision Horticulture, and Robotics held August 12, 2018 Istanbul, Turkey  aAdvances in precision agriculture technologies allow crop management targeting specific needs of individual plants or regions within a crop at specific times rather than at the whole of crop level used in traditional crop production systems. Irrigation is one of the most important inputs in horticultural production systems, but current management practices typically do not allow precise delivery of irrigation inputs where and when they are required within a crop. Multispectral and thermal imagery has the potential to directly assess crop water status at a spatial scale not possible with the current soil sensor probe systems, and thus contribute to improved irrigation decision making. Relationships between thermal imagery data, gathered using a UAV system, and crop water status was determined in a vegetable system (chilli) 'Cayenne' Capsicum annuum 'acuminatum'. Areas within a crop where water stress led to reduced transpiration could be detected in advance of any visible signs of water stress, and patterns of variability detected by the aerial thermal sensor within a crop were also linked to patterns of variability detected by ground-based sensors within the same crop at approximately the same time of day. 3acrop management 3acrop production 3ahorticulture 3airrigation 3aprecision agriculture 3asoil 3athermography 3atranspiration 3avegetables 3awater stress1 aBrown, P.1 aWhite, S.1 aXu, C.1 aKoech, R.0 tActa horticulturae.g2020 June 23, , no. 1279 p.271-278dInternational Society for Horticultural Science.wJournal:jnl46289x0567-75727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.17660/ActaHortic.2020.1279.3940uhttp://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/7656562  aDNAL 7aarticle02125naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100003100154245009700185300001600282500016700298520091800465650002201383650001301405650001801418650001501436650001201451650001501463651001401478651001101492651001001503651002201513651001801535773013701553856005501690961000901745852000901754655001201763IND60691651920201204000000.0200501s2019    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069165192DNAL7 a10.17660/ActaHortic.2019.1252.192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCastellon Petrovich, H.

  1 aJeong, S.M.10aEffect of seed roasting conditions on the antioxidant activity of defatted sesame meal extracts  ap. C377-C382.  aAntioxidant activities of defatted sesame meal extract increased as the roasting temperature of sesame seed increased, but the maximum antioxidant activity was achieved when the seeds were roasted at 200 degrees C for 60 min. Roasting sesame seeds at 200 degrees C for 60 min significantly increased the total phenolic content, radical scavenging activity (RSA), reducing powers, and antioxidant activity of sesame meal extract; and several low-molecular-weight phenolic compounds such as 2-methoxyphenol, 4-methoxy-3-methylthio-phenol, 5-amino-3-oxo-4-hexenoic acid, 3,4-methylenedioxyphenol (sesamol), 3-hydroxy benzoic acid, 4-hydroxy benzoic acid, vanillic acid, filicinic acid, and 3,4-dimethoxy phenol were newly formed in the sesame meal after roasting sesame seeds at 200 degrees C for 60 min. These results indicate that antioxidant activity of defatted sesame meal extracts was significantly affected by roasting temperature and time of sesame seeds. 3afood analysis 3aantioxidant activity 3asesame products 3aroasting 3adefatted foods 3aantioxidants 3aseeds 3aheat treatment1 aKim, S.Y.1 aKim, D.R.1 aNam, K.C.1 aAhn, D.U.1 aLee, S.C.0 tJournal of food science.g2004 , v. 69, no. 5 p.C377-C382x0022-11477nnas  aDNAL  a20070215b20070303c00000000  aINDd3CTe2007/01/02  aOther US 7aarticle01747naa a2200433 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100001500115242009800130245012800228300001600356500002400372500001500396520034100411650002400752650001800776650001200794650001600806650001800822650003500840653001300875653003600888653003300924653003700957653003900994653003601033700001601069700001601085700001401101700001401115773011101129852000901240939003301249945000801282946001101290655001201301991583318900742620221119044804.0830301e19811101xx |||||o|||||||||||ger||7 aPAR830016592DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aReiter, I.10aStudies on the serological diagnosis of experimentally induced bovine and ovine sarcocystosis10aVersuche zum serologischen Nachweis der Sarkosporidiose an experimentell mit Sarkosporidien infizierten Rindern und Schafen  ap. 425-430.  aSummary in English.  a2019-12-04  aSarcocystis spp., calves (exper.), sheep (nat. and exper.), presence of antibodies demonstrated with indirect fluorescent antibody technique, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and indirect hemagglutination test, zoites of S. ovifelis, S. ovicanis, and S. muris used as antigen, titers following homologous and heterologous reinfections 3alabeling techniques 3aserodiagnosis 3aenzymes 3aSarcocystis 3aagglutination 3afluorescent antibody technique 0aimmunity 0aSarcocystis ovicanis (Protozoa) 0aSarcocystis muris (Protozoa) 0aSarcocystis bovicanis (Protozoa) 0aSarcocystis bovihominis (Protozoa) 0aSarcocystis ovifelis (Protozoa)1 aWeiland, G.1 aRoscher, B.1 aMeyer, J.1 aFrahm, K.0 tBerliner und Munchener tierarztliche Wochenschrift.g1981 Nov. 1, v. 94, no. 21 p.425-430x0005-93667nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19830301c00000000  aPAR  aNon-US 7aarticle01921naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002100144245013400165300001800299520094700317650000801264650001801272650000901290650001501299651001201314700002501326700001601351773021001367856004501577852000901622655001201631IND60635752420221119044642.0190403e200712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063575242DNAL7 a10.1623/hysj.52.6.10882doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSlimani, Mohamed10aStructure of the rainfall gradient in the Mediterranean–Sahara transition in Tunisia: geographical determinants and seasonality  ap. 1088-1102.  aA geostatistical analysis of interannual (1961–1990) mean annual rainfall and of its monthly components is made based on a network of 106 raingauges covering the Tunisian territory. The relevance of a power-type variogram for the year and for most months confirms the existence of gradients. Analysis of directional variograms shows that the apparently north/south general gradient results from partial gradients which evolve through the seasons. The spatial characteristics of rainfall depend on geographical determinants, both local with a relatively short range which lead to micro-regionalisation, and regional with a longer range. The major role of topographic structures through the interception of rainfall-generating air masses is shown. The proposed analysis is a contribution to the setting-up of a synoptic hydro-climatic reference for Tunisia itself, and for the Mediterranean–Sahara transition zone of which it is an example. 3aair 3ageostatistics 3arain 3atopography 3aTunisia1 aCudennec, Christophe1 aFeki, Haifa0 tHydrological sciences journal.g2007 Dec., v. 52, no. 6 p.1088-1102dPublished for the International Association of Hydrological Sciences by Blackwell Scientific PublicationswJournal:2013x0262-66677nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1623/hysj.52.6.1088  aDNAL 7aarticle01822naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001500110245012000125300001700245520086800262650002901130650002501159650002601184650002601210650002101236650002501257650003001282700001501312700001301327773011501340852000901455930003301464946001101497655001201508IND4366701720221119044836.0050119e200407  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436670172DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSlomma, N.14aThe effects of cis-9, trans-11 and trans-10, cis-12 conjugated linoleic acids on Delta4-desaturation in HepG2 cells  ap.  243-246.  aThe objective of this study was to determine the effects of cis-9, trans-11 and trans-10, cis-12 conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) on the delta4-desaturation process in HepG2 cells. Experiments were conducted in which HepG2 cells were incubated with 25 micromol/litre of those fatty acids and the concentrations of (n-6) and (n-3) polyunsaturated fatty acids in phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine were determined. In the presence of eicosapentaenoic acid, cells treated with trans-10, cis-12 CLA had a lower ratio of docosahexaenoic acid 22:6 (n-3), the product of delta4-desaturation, to docosapentaenoic acid 22:5 (n-3), the substrate of delta4-desaturation in both phospholipids, than control cells or cells treated with cis-9, trans-11 CLA (P<0.05). This suggests that trans-10, cis-12 CLA suppresses the delta4-desaturation process in HepG2 cells. 3aconjugated linoleic acid 3adocosahexaenoic acid 3adocosapentaenoic acid 3aeicosapentaenoic acid 3ahuman cell lines 3aphosphatidylcholines 3aphosphatidylethanolamines1 aBecker, K.1 aEder, K.0 tInternational journal for vitamin and nutrition research.g2004 July, v. 74, no. 4 p. 243-246x0300-98317nnas  aDNAL  a20080312b20080404c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03829naa a2200673 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024003800133040001800171072001700189072001700206072001700223100002100240245006700261506007600328520174400404506003702148650001902185650001502204650002002219650001302239650001002252650001002262650001902272650001202291650002502303650001202328650002102340650002902361650004202390650002202432650001802454650002802472650004002500650002302540650002802563650001402591650003502605650003302640650002302673650003902696650002202735650002402757653002602781653004002807700002202847700002702869700002402896773005502920852000902975856008802984930003303072945002503105946001303130655001203143IND4434747420221207072734.0100330e201002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443474742DNAL7 a201617142pmid7 aPMC28170082pmcid7 a10.1371/journal.pone.00091102doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aReinhard, Judith10aHoneybees Learn Odour Mixtures via a Selection of Key Odorants  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBackground: The honeybee has to detect, process and learn numerous complex odours from her natural environment on a daily basis. Most of these odours are floral scents, which are mixtures of dozens of different odorants. To date, it is still unclear how the bee brain unravels the complex information contained in scent mixtures. Methodology/Principal Findings: This study investigates learning of complex odour mixtures in honeybees using a simple olfactory conditioning procedure, the Proboscis-Extension-Reflex (PER) paradigm. Restrained honeybees were trained to three scent mixtures composed of 14 floral odorants each, and then tested with the individual odorants of each mixture. Bees did not respond to all odorants of a mixture equally: They responded well to a selection of key odorants, which were unique for each of the three scent mixtures. Bees showed less or very little response to the other odorants of the mixtures. The bees' response to mixtures composed of only the key odorants was as good as to the original mixtures of 14 odorants. A mixture composed of the other, non-key-odorants elicited a significantly lower response. Neither an odorant's volatility or molecular structure, nor learning efficiencies for individual odorants affected whether an odorant became a key odorant for a particular mixture. Odorant concentration had a positive effect, with odorants at high concentration likely to become key odorants. Conclusions/Significance: Our study suggests that the brain processes complex scent mixtures by predominantly learning information from selected key odorants. Our observations on key odorant learning lend significant support to previous work on olfactory learning and mixture processing in honeybees.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aApis mellifera 3ahoney bees 3ainsect behavior 3alearning 3aodors 3asmell 3aodor compounds 3aflowers 2a1-Butanolxchemistry 2aAnimals 2aBeesxphysiology 2aBenzaldehydesxchemistry 2aBridged Bicyclo Compoundsxchemistry. 2aBrainxphysiology 2aBrain Mapping 2aCyclohexenesxchemistry 2aDiscrimination Learningxphysiology 2aFlowersxchemistry 2aMonoterpenesxchemistry 2aOdorants. 2aOlfactory Pathwaysxphysiology 2aOrganic Chemicalsxchemistry 2aReflexxphysiology 2aRetention, Psychologyxphysiology. 2aSmellxphysiology 2aTerpenesxchemistry 0acomplex odor mixtures 0aproboscis extension reflex paradigm1 aSinclair, Michael1 aSrinivasan, Mandyam V.1 aClaudianos, Charles0 tPloS one.g2010 Feb., v. 5, no. 2x1932-62037nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.00091103Available from publisher's Web site  a20110603b20110701c00000000  aINDdRHFe2010/04/13  aOther US 7aarticle02452naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002200152245010200174300001300276500002400289520136500313650003201678650001001710650002001720650002201740650001401762650002601776650001501802700002101817700002201838700002401860700002401884700001901908773009901927852000902026856005502035655001202090IND4447896720221119045027.0110125e201102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444789672DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2435.2010.01777.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGraham, Andrea L.10aFitness consequences of immune responses: strengthening the empirical framework for ecoimmunology  ap. 5-17.  aIncludes references  a1. Ecoimmunologists aim to understand the costs, benefits, and net fitness consequences of different strategies for immune defense. 2. Measuring the fitness consequences of immune responses is difficult, partly because of complex relationships between host fitness and the within-host density of parasites and immunological cells or molecules. In particular, neither the strongest immune responses nor the lowest parasite densities necessarily maximize host fitness. 3. Here, we propose that ecoimmunologists should routinely endeavour to measure three intertwined parameters: host fitness, parasite density, and relevant immune responses. We further propose that analyses of relationships among these traits would benefit from the statistical machinery used for analyses of phenotypic plasticity and/or methods that are robust to the bi-directional causation inherent in host-parasite relationships. For example, analyses of how host fitness depends upon parasite density, which is an evolutionary ecological definition of tolerance, would benefit from these more robust methods. 4. Together, these steps promote rigorous quantification of the fitness consequences of immune responses. Such quantification is essential if ecoimmunologists are to decipher causes of immune polymorphism in nature and predict trajectories of natural selection on immune defense. 3ahost-parasite relationships 3ahosts 3aimmune response 3anatural selection 3aparasites 3aphenotypic plasticity 3aprediction1 aShuker, David M.1 aPollitt, Laura C.1 aAuld, Stuart K.J.R.1 aWilson, Alastair J.1 aLittle, Tom J.0 tFunctional ecology.g2011 Feb., v. 25, no. 1 p.5-17dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0269-84637nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2435.2010.01777.x 7aarticle03547naa a2200661 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024003800133040001800171072001700189072001700206072001700223100002400240245011500264500001500379506007600394520159700470506003702067650002002104650001502124650002002139650002202159650001602181650001702197650002202214650003102236650001302267650001402280650001902294650002502313650002502338650001802363650001302381650001202394650001202406650003702418650001402455650001602469651001802485651001802503653001602521653001302537653001802550700002102568700001902589700002302608700001902631773005502650852000902705856008802714930003302802945002502835946001302860655001202873IND4428496320221207045203.0091110e200908  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442849632DNAL7 a197075702pmid7 aPMC27285452pmcid7 a10.1371/journal.pone.00068022doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Here we illustrate the land-use impact to U.S. habitat types of new energy development resulting from different U.S. energy policies. We estimated the total new land area needed by 2030 to produce energy, under current law and under various cap-and-trade policies, and then partitioned the area impacted among habitat types with geospatial data on the feasibility of production. The land-use intensity of different energy production techniques varies over three orders of magnitude, from 1.9–2.8 km2/TW hr/yr for nuclear power to 788–1000 km2/TW hr/yr for biodiesel from soy. In all scenarios, temperate deciduous forests and temperate grasslands will be most impacted by future energy development, although the magnitude of impact by wind, biomass, and coal to different habitat types is policy-specific. Regardless of the existence or structure of a cap-and-trade bill, at least 206,000 km2 will be impacted without substantial increases in energy efficiency, which saves at least 7.6 km2 per TW hr of electricity conserved annually and 27.5 km2 per TW hr of liquid fuels conserved annually. Climate policy that reduces carbon dioxide emissions may increase the areal impact of energy, although the magnitude of this potential side effect may be substantially mitigated by increases in energy efficiency. The possibility of widespread energy sprawl increases the need for energy conservation, appropriate siting, sustainable production practices, and compensatory mitigation offsets.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aland use change 3agrasslands 3acrop production 3adeciduous forests 3aGlycine max 3aenergy crops 3atemperate forests 3aenergy use and consumption 3asoybeans 3abiodiesel 3aclimate change 3ahabitat conservation 3aenvironmental impact 3anuclear power 3ahabitats 3abiomass 2aClimate 2aConservation of Energy Resources 2aEcosystem 2aEnvironment 3aUnited States 0aUnited States 0awind energy 0aland use 0aenergy policy1 aFargione, Joseph1 aKiesecker, Joe1 aMiller, William M.1 aPowell, Jimmie0 tPloS one.g2009 Aug., v. 4, no. 8x1932-62037nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.00068023Available from publisher's Web site  a20100122b20100205c00000000  aINDdRHFe2010/01/21  aOther US 7aarticle02681naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002000145245009600165300001600261500002400277520133400301650002301635650002201658650002201680650001301702650001701715650001001732650001201742650001601754650001501770650001201785650003001797650001801827650001701845700002301862700003101885700003001916700002501946700002101971700002201992700001902014700002002033773010102053852000902154856004802163655001202211IND4432080120221119045015.0100129e200911  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443208012DNAL7 a10.1007/s10600-010-9496-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGhasemi, Younes10aC-20 ketone reduction of hydrocortisone by rice field microalga Chlorella vulgaris MCCS 013  ap. 824-828.  aIncludes references  aA unicellular microalga, Chlorella vulgaris, was isolated from rice field and applied in the biotransformation experiment of hydrocortisone (1). This strain has not been previously tested for hydrocortisone bioconversion. Fermentation was carried out in BG-11 medium supplemented with 0.05% substrate at 25°C for 14 days incubation. The products obtained were chromatographically purified followed by their characterization using spectroscopic methods. 11β,17α,20β,21-Tetrahydroxypregn-4-en-3-one (2), 11β,17β-dihydroxyandrost-4-en-3-one (3), and 11β-hydroxyandrost-4-ene-3,17-dione (4) were the main bioproducts in the hydrocortisone bioconversion. Bioreaction characteristics observed were 20-ketone reduction for accumulation of compound 2 and side chain degradation of the substrate to prepare compounds 3 and 4. Time course study showed the accumulation of the product 2 from the second day of the fermentation and 3 as well as 4 from the third day. All the metabolites reached their maximum concentration in seven days. Microalgal 18S rRNA gene was also amplified by PCR. PCR products were sequenced to confirm their authenticity as 18S rRNA gene of microalgae. The result of PCR blasted with other sequenced microalgae in NCBI showed 100% homology to the 18S small subunit rRNA of six strains of Chlorella vulgaris. 3aChlorella vulgaris 3abiobased products 3abiotransformation 3acortisol 3afermentation 3agenes 3aketones 3ametabolites 3amicroalgae 3apaddies 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aribosomal RNA 3aspectroscopy1 aRasoul-Amini, Sara1 aHossein Morowvat, Mohammad1 aBagher Ghoshoon, Mohammad1 aJavad Raee, Mohammad1 aKhoubani, Soraya1 aNegintaji, Narges1 aNouri, Fatemeh1 aParvizi, Rezvan0 tChemistry of natural compounds.g2009 Nov., v. 45, no. 6 p.824-828dSpringer USx0009-31307nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10600-010-9496-6 7aarticle01621naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127072001700144100001700161245008400178300001800262500001500280520046100295650001800756650001500774650001400789650002300803650002800826650002400854650001100878650002100889650001000910650002000920650001100940653001500951653002000966700001500986700001501001773007901016852000901095930003301104945002501137946001301162655001201175IND4366437520221119045012.0050106e200411  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436643752DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

We offer a potential explanation to these inconsistencies. Results from a controlled cafeteria study suggest that health and diet labels might improve the perceived taste of less healthy, hedonic foods (such as desserts and possibly snack foods) without influencing the taste of more healthy utilitarian foods (such as entrees or possibly yogurt and soy foods). These findings have immediate implications for reinterpreting past research findings that may have gone unnoticed because they appeared inconsistent with conventional thinking. 3acafeterias 3arestaurant foods 3aflavor 3asatiety 3anutrition labeling 3afood acceptability 0afood labeling 0ahealthy labels 0afood choices 0acafeteria foods 0adiet labels1 aVan Ittersum, K.1 aPainter, J.E.0 tJournal of food science.g2004 , v. 69, no. 9 p.S340-S346x0022-11477nnas  aDNAL  a20050809b00000000c00000000  aINDdRHFe2005/05/26  aOther US 7aarticle03219naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024002800133040001800161072000900179100002000188245010700208300001600315500002400331506007600355520173600431506003702167650002602204650001502230650001602245650001702261650001602278650001902294650003002313650005902343650001902402650002002421650001002441653002702451700001602478773009902494852000902593856007802602930003302680945002502713946001102738655001202749IND4378910420221207045248.0060319e200604  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437891042DNAL7 a164787672pmid7 aPMC28036662pmcid7 a10.1093/aob/mcl0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF6001 aMcLetchie, D.N.10aSporophyte and gametophyte generations differ in their thermotolerance response in the moss Microbryum  ap. 505-511.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND AND AIMS: Actively growing post-embryonic sporophytes of desert mosses are restricted to the cooler, wetter months. However, most desert mosses have perennial gametophytes. It is hypothesized that these life history patterns are due in part to a reduced thermotolerance for sporophytes relative to gametophytes. METHODS: Gametophytes with attached embryonic sporophytes of Microbryum starckeanum were exposed whilst desiccated to thermal episodes of 35 °C (1 hr), 55 °C (1 hr), 75 °C (1 hr) and 75 °C (3 hr), then moistened and allowed to recover for 35 d in a growth chamber. KEY RESULTS: All of the gametophytes survived the thermal exposures and produced protonemata, with the majority also producing shoot buds. Symptoms of gametophytic stress (leaf burning and discoloration of entire shoots) were present in lower frequencies in the 55 °C exposure. Sporophyte resumption of growth and maturation to meiosis were significantly negatively affected by thermal treatment. Not a single sporophyte exposed to the two higher thermal treatments (75 °C for 1 h and 75 °C for 3 h) survived to meiosis, and those sporophytes exposed to 75 °C that survived to the post-embryonic phenophase took significantly longer to reach this phase. Furthermore, among the thermal treatments where some capsules reached maturity (35 °C and 55 °C), maternal shoots that produced a meiotic capsule took longer to regenerate through protonemata than maternal shoots aborting their sporophyte, suggestive of a resource trade-off between generations. CONCLUSIONS: Either (1) the inherent sporophyte thermotolerance is quite low even in this desert moss, and/or (2) a gametophytic thermal stress response controls sporophyte viability.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3amosses and liverworts 3axerophytes 3asporophytes 3agametophytes 3aheat stress 3aheat tolerance 2aAdaptation, Physiological 2aBryopsidaxcytologyxgrowth & developmentxphysiology. 2aDesert Climate 2aHot Temperature 2aWater 0aMicrobryum starckeanum1 aStark, L.R.0 tAnnals of botany.g2006 Apr., v. 97, no. 4 p.505-511dOxford University Pressx0305-73647nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/aob/mcl0113Available from publisher's Web site  a20060327b20060402c00000000  aINDdMKSe2006/03/27  aNon-US 7aarticle03268naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024003800133040001800171072001700189072001700206100002300223245009800246500001500344506007600359520187500435506003702310650001802347650001202365650002502377650002102402650002402423650001402447650001102461650002402472650001702496651001102513651001102524653001102535653002902546773005502575852000902630856008802639930003302727945002502760946001302785655001202798IND4427371020221207045211.0091016e200902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442737102DNAL7 a192239662pmid7 aPMC26368892pmcid7 a10.1371/journal.pone.00044622doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aDaehler, Curtis C.10aShort Lag Times for Invasive Tropical Plants: Evidence from Experimental Plantings in Hawai'i  a2019-12-05  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBackground: The lag time of an invasion is the delay between arrival of an introduced species and its successful spread in a new area. To date, most estimates of lag times for plants have been indirect or anecdotal, and these estimates suggest that plant invasions are often characterized by lag times of 50 years or more. No general estimates are available of lag times for tropical plant invasions. Historical plantings and documentation were used to directly estimate lag times for tropical plant invasions in Hawai'i. Methodology/Principal Findings: Historical planting records for the Lyon Arboretum dating back to 1920 were examined to identify plants that have since become invasive pests in the Hawaiian Islands. Annual reports describing escape from plantings were then used to determine the lag times between initial plantings and earliest recorded spread of the successful invaders. Among 23 species that eventually became invasive pests, the average lag time between introduction and first evidence of spread was 14 years for woody plants and 5 years for herbaceous plants. Conclusions/Significance: These direct estimates of lag times are as much as an order of magnitude shorter than previous, indirect estimates, which were mainly based on temperate plants. Tropical invaders may have much shorter lag times than temperate species. A lack of direct and deliberate observations may have also inflated many previous lag time estimates. Although there have been documented cases of long lag times due to delayed arrival of a mutualist or environmental changes over time, this study suggests that most successful invasions are likely to begin shortly after arrival of the plant in a suitable habitat, at least in tropical environments. Short lag times suggest that controlled field trials may be a practical element of risk assessment for plant introductions.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aplant ecology 3atropics 3alongitudinal studies 3ainvasive species 3aecological invasion 2aEcosystem 2aPlants 2aPopulation Dynamics 2aTime Factors 3aHawaii 0aHawaii 0aplants 0atropical plant invasions0 tPloS one.g2009 Feb., v. 4, no. 2x1932-62037nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.00044623Available from publisher's Web site  a20100109b20100205c00000000  aINDdRHFe2010/01/08  aOther US 7aarticle03946naa a2200661 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024003800133040001800171072001700189100002200206245009800228500001500326506007600341520200800417506003702425650002702462650001102489650002002500650000902520650002302529650001202552650001802564650002102582650000902603650001202612650001802624650002102642650001102663650002702674650003802701650001302739650003302752650001102785650001902796650001902815650001902834653001402853653002102867653001202888700002302900700002102923700002102944700002102965700002302986700002303009700001703032773005503049852000903104856008803113930003303201945002503234946001303259655001203272IND4427358720221207072919.0091015e200904  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442735872DNAL7 a193906982pmid7 aPMC26695012pmcid7 a10.1371/journal.pone.00053302doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aHunt, W. Grainger10aLead Bullet Fragments in Venison from Rifle-Killed Deer: Potential for Human Dietary Exposure  a2019-12-05  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aHuman consumers of wildlife killed with lead ammunition may be exposed to health risks associated with lead ingestion. This hypothesis is based on published studies showing elevated blood lead concentrations in subsistence hunter populations, retention of ammunition residues in the tissues of hunter-killed animals, and systemic, cognitive, and behavioral disorders associated with human lead body burdens once considered safe. Our objective was to determine the incidence and bioavailability of lead bullet fragments in hunter-killed venison, a widely-eaten food among hunters and their families. We radiographed 30 eviscerated carcasses of White-tailed Deer (Odocoileus virginianus) shot by hunters with standard lead-core, copper-jacketed bullets under normal hunting conditions. All carcasses showed metal fragments (geometric mean = 136 fragments, range = 15–409) and widespread fragment dispersion. We took each carcass to a separate meat processor and fluoroscopically scanned the resulting meat packages; fluoroscopy revealed metal fragments in the ground meat packages of 24 (80%) of the 30 deer; 32% of 234 ground meat packages contained at least one fragment. Fragments were identified as lead by ICP in 93% of 27 samples. Isotope ratios of lead in meat matched the ratios of bullets, and differed from background lead in bone. We fed fragment-containing venison to four pigs to test bioavailability; four controls received venison without fragments from the same deer. Mean blood lead concentrations in pigs peaked at 2.29 µg/dL (maximum 3.8 µg/dL) 2 days following ingestion of fragment-containing venison, significantly higher than the 0.63 µg/dL averaged by controls. We conclude that people risk exposure to bioavailable lead from bullet fragments when they eat venison from deer killed with standard lead-based rifle bullets and processed under normal procedures. At risk in the U.S. are some ten million hunters, their families, and low-income beneficiaries of venison donations.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aOdocoileus virginianus 3ahumans 3abioavailability 3alead 3afood contamination 3avenison 3asport hunting 3adietary exposure 3adeer 2aAnimals 2aAnimals, Wild 2aDeerxmetabolism 2aEating 2aEnvironmental Exposure 2aEnvironmental Monitoringxmethods 2aFirearms 2aFood Contaminationxanalysis 2aHumans 2aLeadxanalysis 2aLead Poisoning 2aMeatxanalysis 0agame meat 0abullet fragments 0abullets1 aWatson, Richard T.1 aOaks, J.

  1 aPaul-Victor, Cloé14aThe Effect of Growth Conditions on the Seed Size/Number Trade-Off  a2019-12-05  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBackground: If the amount of resources allocated to reproduction (K) is fixed, then an increase in seed mass (S) can only be achieved by a decrease in seed number (n = K/S). Thus, log(n) = log(K)−log(S) producing a slope of −1 when seed mass and number are plotted on log-log axes. However, in comparative studies, empirical support for a slope of −1 is limited and contentious, leading some to question the utility of this concept. Methodology/Principal Findings: First, we show that the expected slope depends on whether genotypes and species producing seeds of different mass are expected to reach the same adult size and that this in turn depends partly on the nature of growth. Second, we present experimental results using a population of recombinant inbred lines (RILs) of Arabidopsis thaliana. When these RILs are grown in large pots with plentiful nutrients, they exhibit a trade-off between seed size and number with a slope of −1.68 (±0.18) on log-log axes. This occurs because of genetic correlations between seed mass and adult size so that, under the right growth conditions, lines producing lighter seeds have the genetic potential to produce larger rosettes and hence a greater total mass of seeds. We re-grew lines in small pots (10 and 40 mm diameter) in a nutrient-poor substrate so that final adult size was heavily restricted by pot size. Conclusions/Significance: Under our growth conditions, small-seeded lines were unable to produce a greater total mass of seeds. Hence a trade-off emerged between seed mass and seed number with a slope of −1.166±0.319 on log-log axes in 40-mm diameter pots (close to the expected value of −1), although the slope was 0.132±0.263 in 10-mm diameter pots, demonstrating that the nature of the trade-off is sensitive to the growth conditions.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3amathematics and statistics 3aseeds 3agenetic correlation 3amature plants 3ainbred lines 3aseed productivity 3aseed set 3adimensions 2aArabidopsisxgeneticsxgrowth & developmentxphysiology. 2aGenetic Techniques 2aGenetic Variation 2aGenotype 2aModels, Biological 2aModels, Genetic 2aPlant Physiological Phenomena 2aSeedlingsxgrowth & development. 2aSeedsxgrowth & development 2aSoil 2aSpecies Specificity 2aTime Factors 0aseed size 0alines 0aseed number 0aplants 0aseed mass1 aTurnbull, Lindsay A.0 tPloS one.g2009 Sept., v. 4, no. 9x1932-62037nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.00069173Available from publisher's Web site  a20100607b20100703c00000000  aINDdRHFe2010/06/07  aOther US 7aarticle04584naa a2200661 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111072000900129100002100138245005300159300001800212500018500230500002400415500001500439520251800454650002302972650001002995650001903005650002003024650001703044650002603061650002303087650001803110650001603128650004703144650001203191650002303203650001803226650001403244650003103258650000903289650005103298650004203349650004603391650001403437650001803451650002203469650001103491650001403502650000903516650003803525650002903563650001403592650001303606650003803619650001003657653002103667653002203688773012003710852000903830930003303839945002503872946001303897655001203910IND4378903520221119045057.0060319e200604  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437890352DNAL7 a165379632pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL5001 aEastridge, M.

Over the past 25 yr, at least 2,567 articles relating to ruminant or dairy nutrition have been published in the Journal of Dairy Science. These studies have provided important advancements in improving feed efficiency and animal health by improving quality of feeds, increasing feedstuff and overall diet digestibility, better defining interactions among feedstuffs in diets, identifying alternative feed ingredients, better defining nutrient requirements, and improving efficiency of ruminal fermentation. The publications are vital in continuing to make advancements in providing adequate nutrition to dairy cattle and for facilitating exchange of knowledge among scientists. Forages have been studied more extensively than any other type of feed. Cereal grains continue to be the primary contributors of starch to diets, and thus are very important in meeting the energy needs of dairy cattle. Processing of cereal grains has improved their use. Feeding by-products contributes valuable nutrients to diets and allows feedstuffs to be used that would otherwise be handled as wastes in landfills. Many of these by-products provide a considerable amount of protein, nonforage fiber, fat, and minerals (sometimes a detriment as in the case of P) to diets. The primary feeding system today is the total mixed ration, with still considerable use of the pasture system. Major improvements have occurred in the use of protein, carbohydrates, and fats in diets. Although advancements have been made in feeding practices to minimize the risk of metabolic diseases, the periparturient period continues to present some of the greatest challenges in animal health. Computers are a must today for diet formulation and evaluation, but fewer software programs are developed by universities. Several nutrition conferences are held regularly in the United States that are vital for transferring knowledge to the feed industry and the producers of food; the attendance at such programs has increased about 4-fold over the past 25 yr. More emphasis on animal welfare will direct some of the areas of nutrition research. Challenges ahead include having adequate funding for conducting applied nutrition research and for training of students as scientists and for employment in the feed industry. 3aruminant nutrition 3afeeds 3acattle feeding 3afeed conversion 3adairy cattle 3anutrient requirements 3arumen fermentation 3adigestibility 2aAnimal Feed 2aAnimal Nutritional Physiological Phenomena 2aAnimals 2aCattlexphysiology 2aEdible Grain. 2aComputers 2aDairyingxmethodsxtrends. 2aDiet 2aDietary Carbohydratesxadministration & dosage 2aDietary Fatsxadministration & dosage 2aDietary Proteinsxadministration & dosage 2aDigestion 2aEnergy Intake 2aEnergy Metabolism 2aFemale 2aLactation 2aMilk 2aMineralsxadministration & dosage 2aNutritional Requirements 2aPregnancy 2aResearch 2aVitaminsxadministration & dosage 2aWater 0aanimal nutrition 0aapplied nutrition0 tJournal of dairy science.g2006 Apr., v. 89, no. 4 p.1311-1323dAmerican Dairy Science Associationx0022-03027nnas  aDNAL  a20060522b20060607c00000000  aINDdNZMe2006/05/16  aOther US 7aarticle03283naa a2200625 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146072000900164072000900173100001800182245008500200300001600285500002400301500001500325520126800340650002501608650001801633650001901651650002501670650003101695650002501726650001301751650002101764650006101785650003501846650002601881650001801907650003301925650002501958650004601983650004402029650001702073650002502090650002202115650002102137650002602158650005002184650004202234650003802276653002002314653002802334653002102362700001702383773008202400852000902482856008502491930003302576945002502609946001102634655001202645IND4378877020221119045055.0060317e200511  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437887702DNAL7 a160345972pmid7 a10.1007/s00425-005-0028-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF200 0aF6001 aPanchuk, I.I.10aExpression of the Apx gene family during leaf senescence of Arabidopsis thaliana  ap. 926-932.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aOxygen-free radicals are thought to play an essential role in senescence. Therefore, the expression patterns of the small gene family encoding the H₂O₂ scavenging enzymes ascorbate peroxidase (APX; EC 1.11.1.11) were analyzed during senescence of Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) Heinh. Applying real-time RT-PCR, the mRNA levels were quantified for three cytosolic (APX1, APX2, APX6), two chloroplastic types (stromal sAPX, thylakoid tAPX), and three microsomal (APX3, APX4, APX5) isoforms identified in the genome of Arabidopsis. The genes of chloroplastic thylakoid-bound tAPX and the microsomal APX4 exhibit a strong age-related decrease of mRNA level in leaves derived from one rosette as well as in leaves derived from plants of different ages. In contrast to the tAPX, the mRNA of sAPX was only reduced in old leaves of old plants. The microsomal APX3 and APX5, and the cytosolic APX1, APX2, and APX6 did not show remarkable age-related changes in mRNA levels. The data show that expression of the individual APX genes is differentially regulated during senescence indicating possible functional specialization of respective isoenzymes. The hydrogen peroxide levels seem to be controlled very precisely in different cell compartments during plant development. 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3amessenger RNA 3aplant genetics 3aascorbate peroxidase 3agene expression regulation 3anucleotide sequences 3aisozymes 3aleaf development 2aArabidopsisxgeneticsxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aArabidopsis Proteinsxgenetics 2aAscorbate Peroxidases 2aBase Sequence 2aDNA, Complementaryxgenetics 2aDNA, Plantxgenetics 2aGene Expression Regulation, Developmental 2aGene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic 2aGenes, Plant 2aIsoenzymesxgenetics 2aMembrane Proteins 2aMultigene Family 2aPeroxidasesxgenetics 2aPlant Leavesxgeneticsxgrowth & development. 2aRNA, Messengerxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aRNA, Plantxgeneticsxmetabolism. 0aleaf senescence 0amolecular sequence data 0aplant physiology1 aZentgraf, U.0 tPlanta.g2005 Nov., v. 222, no. 5 p.926-932dSpringer-Verlagx0032-09357nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00425-005-0028-83Available from publisher's Web site  a20080210b20080301c00000000  aINDdRSCe2006/03/28  aNon-US 7aarticle04342naa a2200817 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146072000900164072000900173072000900182100001700191245015600208300001600364500002400380500001500404520183600419650001002255650001402265650002102279650001902300650002402319650003202343650002502375650001502400650002502415650002402440650001202464650001702476650002002493650001902513650002202532650001902554650002102573650002302594650004902617650002802666650001202694650003802706650002002744650002902764650002802793650001802821650004002839650002602879650001402905650003002919650003802949650004202987650002803029653002303057653001903080653002803099653002003127653002603147653002103173653002503194700001503219700001803234700001503252773008203267852000903349856008503358930003303443945002503476946001103501655001203512IND4378877720221119044902.0060317e200512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437887772DNAL7 a162702042pmid7 a10.1007/s00425-005-0037-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF600 0aF200 0aF4001 aCurtis, I.S.10aModification of plant architecture through the expression of GA 2-oxidase under the control of an estrogen inducible promoter in Arabidopsis thaliana L  ap. 957-967.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe gibberellin (GA) 2-oxidase (PcGA2ox1) from bean catalyses the 2β-hydroxylation of some precursor and bioactive GAs resulting in their inactivation. We have expressed PcGA2ox1 under the control of the estrogen receptor-based chemical-inducible system, XVE, to modify plant architecture and assess whether transgene expression is localised. Applications of estradiol to the shoot apical region of inducible PcGA2ox1 overexpressors exhibited delays in both bolting (maximum of 46 days) and times to anthesis (maximum of 62 days) compared to wildtype (36 and 41 days, respectively), without altering leaf area. Individual treated leaves showed signs of epinasty and became dark green; such estradiol-treated regions maintained these 'green-islands' well beyond the onset of leaf senescence. Northern blots revealed that the PcGA2ox1 transcript could be detected within 1 h of treatment. The level of PcGA2ox1 transcript appeared to peak 3-5 h after estradiol application in both high and semi expressors. Quantitative Reverse Transcription (QRT)-PCR data showed that GA down-regulated genes AtGA3ox1, AtGA20ox1 and SCARECROW-LIKE3 (SCL3) were up-regulated and the GA up-regulated genes AtGA2ox1 and AtExp1 were down-regulated in estradiol-treated leaves of inducible PcGA2ox1 overexpressors; neighbouring non-treated leaves showing no significant changes. Further molecular analyses revealed that expression of the transgene was confined to estradiol-treated leaves only. Expression profiles of GA down- and up-regulated genes in inducer-treated overexpressors appeared to be synchronised with changes in leaf phenotype. These observations suggest that PcGA2ox1 under the control of the XVE system can be used effectively to alter plant architecture in Arabidopsis by localised 2β-hydroxylation of GAs at estradiol-treated sites. 3abeans 3aestradiol 3apromoter regions 3aplant proteins 3aPhaseolus coccineus 3arecombinant fusion proteins 3aphenotypic variation 3aoxygenases 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3agene overexpression 3abolting 3agibberellins 3aenzyme activity 3aplant genetics 3atransgenic plants 3areporter genes 3aplant morphology 3abeta-glucuronidase 2aArabidopsisxgeneticsxgrowth & development. 2aEstradiolxpharmacology 2aFlowers 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plant 2aGenetic Vectors 2aGibberellinsxmetabolism 2aGlucuronidasexgenetics 2aHydroxylation 2aMixed Function Oxygenasesxgenetics 2aPhaseolusxenzymology 2aPhenotype 2aPromoter Regions, Genetic 2aReceptors, Estrogenxdrug effects 2aRecombinant Fusion Proteinsxgenetics 2aTransformation, Genetic 0aplant biochemistry 0aflowering time 0amolecular sequence data 0agene expression 0agibberellin 2-oxidase 0aplant physiology 0anucleotide sequences1 aHanada, A.1 aYamaguchi, S.1 aKamiya, Y.0 tPlanta.g2005 Dec., v. 222, no. 6 p.957-967dSpringer-Verlagx0032-09357nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00425-005-0037-73Available from publisher's Web site  a20080210b20080301c00000000  aINDdRSCe2006/03/27  aNon-US 7aarticle03374naa a2200637 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024003800133040001800171072001700189072001700206072001700223100002000240245010700260500001500367506007600382520141100458506003701869650001401906650004001920650001201960650001301972650002201985650002302007650002402030650001202054650002202066650001302088650002402101653001302125653001902138653003602157653002602193653001802219700002702237700002102264700001902285700002402304700002702328700002302355700002302378700002302401700002702424700002802451700002202479773005502501852000902556856008802565930003302653945002502686946001302711655001202724IND4434753820221207073123.0100330e201001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443475382DNAL7 a200908502pmid7 aPMC28068302pmcid7 a10.1371/journal.pone.00087112doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

However, the importance of intraspecific genetic variation and diversity to floral abundance and pollinator visitation has received little attention. Methodology/Principal Findings: Using an experimental common garden that manipulated genotypic diversity (the number of distinct genotypes per plot) of Solidago altissima, we document that genotypic diversity of a dominant plant can indirectly influence flower visitor abundance. Across two years, we found that 1) plant genotype explained 45% and 92% of the variation in flower visitor abundance in 2007 and 2008, respectively; and 2) plant genotypic diversity had a positive and non-additive effect on floral abundance and the abundance of flower visitors, as plots established with multiple genotypes produced 25% more flowers and received 45% more flower visits than would be expected under an additive model. Conclusions/Significance: These results provide evidence that declines in genotypic diversity may be an important but little considered factor for understanding plant-pollinator dynamics, with implications for the global decline in pollinators due to reduced plant diversity in both agricultural and natural ecosystems.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aflowering 3aSolidago altissima subsp. altissima 3aflowers 3agenotype 3agenetic variation 3ainsect pollination 3apollinating insects 2aFlowers 2aGenetic Variation 2aGenotype 2aSpecies Specificity 0aSolidago 0ainflorescences 0aSolidago canadensis var. scabra 0apollinator visitation 0aflower visits1 aLessard, Jean-Philippe1 aBrown, Claire B.1 aBunn, Windy A.1 aCregger, Melissa A.1 aReynolds, Wm.

Stomatal movement is accomplished by a reversible exchange of potassium and chloride between these two cell types. To gain insight into the molecular machinery involved in K⁺ transport within the stomatal complex of Zea mays, we determined the spatial and temporal expression pattern of potassium channels in the maize leaf. KZM2 and ZORK were isolated and identified as new members of the plant Shaker K⁺ channel family. Northern blot analysis identified fully developed leaves as the predominant site of KZM2 expression. Following enzymatic digestion and separation of leaf tissue into epidermal, mesophyll, and vascular fractions, KZM2 and ZORK transcripts were localized in the epidermis. Using a collection of individually isolated guard cell or subsidiary cell protoplasts, ZORK transcripts were found in both cell types while KZM2 was exclusively expressed in the guard cell population. The previously identified K⁺ channel genes ZMK1 and KZM1 were expressed in subsidiary cells and guard cells, respectively, whereas ZMK2 transcripts were not detected. These data indicate that the interaction between subsidiary cells and guard cells is based on overlapping as well as differential expression of K⁺ channels in the two cell types of the maize stomatal complex. 3aZea mays 3acorn 3agrain crops 3astomata 3aguard cells 3apotassium channels 3agene expression regulation 3atranscription (genetics) 3aplant biochemistry 3aplant genetics 3aamino acid sequences 3anucleotide sequences 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aBlotting, Northern 2aGene Expression 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPlant Leavesxmetabolism 2aPlant Proteinsxgenetics 2aReverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction 2aShaker Superfamily of Potassium Channelsxgenetics 2aZea maysxcytologyxgenetics. 0amolecular sequence data1 aMarten, I.1 aBecker, D.1 aPhilippar, K.1 aAche, P.1 aHedrich, R.0 tPlanta.g2005 Dec., v. 222, no. 6 p.968-976dSpringer-Verlagx0032-09357nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00425-005-0038-63Available from publisher's Web site  a20080210b20080301c00000000  aINDdRSCe2006/03/27  aNon-US 7aarticle03276naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001400153245007700167500016700244520190300411650002102314650002002335650001102355650001702366650001502383650001302398650001302411650002102424650002802445650001202473650001302485650001302498650001002511650000902521650001802530650001602548650001302564650002202577650001002599651001002609773012702619856005402746961000902800852000902809655001202818IND60691650820221119044908.0200501s2019    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069165082DNAL7 a10.17660/ActaHortic.2019.1252.82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDreni, M.14aThe use of biodegradable mulching on industry tomatoes in northern Italy  aPaper presented at the XXI International Congress on Plastics in Agriculture: Agriculture, Plastics and Environment held May 29-31, 1018 Bordeaux-Arcachon, France  aItaly is one of the main producers of processing tomatoes in the world; about half of this production is located in northern Italy. AOP CIO started in 2013 to use biodegradable mulch film, as a tool to improve the sustainability of processing tomatoes cultivations. The main agronomical goals of CIO for the introduction of biodegradable mulch films in processing tomatoes were: chemical herbicides reduction; increase early ripening; low temperatures protection mainly in the early developing stages; water usage optimizing. The main results on the use of this innovative technique are listed below: a) the “bio-mulching” technique is allowed for the cultivation of processing tomato; b) biodegradable mulch films are effective in controlling the weeds on the row; c) it is possible to cultivate processing tomato without chemical herbicide, integrating biodegradable mulch films on the row and mechanical weeding between the rows; d) the biodegradable mulches have shown to protect the plants from low temperature in the first phase of development, so is possible to anticipate either transplanting and harvesting date; e) reduction of the irrigation water can be an achievable goal (a higher level of humidity under the mulch film, compared to bare soil, has been observed thanks to the use of specific probes put in the soil); f) a better development of the roots under biodegradable mulch films has been observed, this could make the plants more resistant to environmental stresses; g) the total yield obtained by mulched plants was higher compared to the traditional technique; also the quality of the crop obtained was better (either higher sugar content and percentage of marketable fruits) probably due to a more concentrate period of ripening; h) finally, no fragments of biodegradable mulch films were found in the harvested products or in the soils where the mulches have been used. 3abiodegradability 3acrop production 3afruits 3aharvest date 3aherbicides 3ahumidity 3aindustry 3airrigation water 3amechanical weed control 3amulches 3amulching 3aripening 3aroots 3asoil 3asugar content 3atemperature 3atomatoes 3awater utilization 3aweeds 3aItaly0 tActa horticulturae.g2019, , no. 1252dInternational Society for Horticultural Science.wJournal:jnl46289x0567-75727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.17660/ActaHortic.2019.1252.8  aUSDA  aDNAL 7aarticle03629naa a2200793 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146072000900164100001600173245012300189300001600312500002400328500001500352520111400367650002701481650001901508650001701527650002201544650002401566650002201590650002601612650002501638650002101663650002501684650002001709650002501729650002001754650001401774650001201788650003901800650002401839650001801863650005501881650002301936650003301959650002501992650003702017650002002054650001702074650005402091650001302145650002802158650003302186650004702219650005502266650003402321650003502355653001402390653002002404653002702424653002802451653002702479700001302506700001602519700001502535700001102550700001702561773008202578852000902660856008502669930003302754945002502787946001102812655001202823IND4378876720221119045046.0060317e200511  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437887672DNAL7 a161332162pmid7 a10.1007/s00425-005-0031-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF2001 aRuppert, M.10aFunctional expression of an ajmaline pathway-specific esterase from Rauvolfia in a novel plant-virus expression system  ap. 888-898.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aAcetylajmalan esterase (AAE) plays an essential role in the late stage of ajmaline biosynthesis. Based on the partial peptide sequences of AAE isolated and purified from Rauvolfia cell suspensions, a full-length AAE cDNA clone was isolated. The amino acid sequence of AAE has the highest level of identity of 40% to putative lipases known from the Arabidopsis thaliana genome project. Based on the primary structure AAE is a new member of the GDSL lipase superfamily. The expression in Escherichia coli failed although a wide range of conditions were tested. With a novel virus-based plant expression system, it was possible to express AAE functionally in leaves of Nicotiana benthamiana Domin. An extraordinarily high enzyme activity was detected in the Nicotiana tissue, which exceeded that in Rauvolfia serpentina (L.) Benth. ex Kurz cell suspension cultures about 20-fold. This expression allowed molecular analysis of AAE for the first time and increased the number of functionally expressed alkaloid genes from Rauvolfia now to eight, and the number of ajmaline pathway-specific cDNAs to a total of six. 3agenetic transformation 3aplant genetics 3abiosynthesis 3acomplementary DNA 3agene overexpression 3atransgenic plants 3aNicotiana benthamiana 3aamino acid sequences 3aindole alkaloids 3aRauvolfia serpentina 3aenzyme kinetics 3anucleotide sequences 3aenzyme activity 3aesterases 3atobacco 2aAjmalinexbiosynthesisxchemistry. 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aBase Sequence 2aCarboxylic Ester Hydrolasesxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aCloning, Molecular 2aDNA, Complementaryxgenetics 2aDNA, Plantxgenetics 2aEsterasesxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aGene Expression 2aGenes, Plant 2aGreen Fluorescent Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aKinetics 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPlants, Genetically Modified 2aRauwolfiaxgeneticsxmetabolismxvirology. 2aRecombinant Fusion Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aSequence Homology, Amino Acid 2aTobaccoxenzymologyxgenetics. 0aRauvolfia 0agene expression 0aacetylajmalan esterase 0amolecular sequence data 0aRauvolfia verticillata1 aWoll, J.1 aGiritch, A.1 aGenady, E.1 aMa, X.1 aStockigt, J.0 tPlanta.g2005 Nov., v. 222, no. 5 p.888-898dSpringer-Verlagx0032-09357nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00425-005-0031-03Available from publisher's Web site  a20080210b20080301c00000000  aINDdRSCe2006/03/28  aNon-US 7aarticle01615naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127100001400144245009700158300001800255500001500273520059000288650001100878650001400889650001200903650002000915650001000935650002400945650001300969650001700982653000900999653002001008700001401028700001601042773007901058852000901137930003301146945002501179946001301204655001201217IND4366439220221119045008.0050106e200411  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436643922DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

The effects of chilling and hypoxia treatments on skin color of Japanese common squid Todarodes pacificus and spear squid Loligo bleekeri were investigated to prevent highly fresh squids from abnormal fading skin color with inappropriate commercial value losses. Skin color of the squids gradually faded away during ice-cold storage. Measurements of chromatophores expansion showed that skin color can be maintained well after death by keeping the bodies well-oxygenated and avoiding direct contact with ice. 3aLoligo 3araw foods 3acooling 3astorage quality 3acolor 3aTodarodes pacificus 3acalamari 3acold storage 0askin 0aLoligo bleekeri1 aUshio, H.1 aOhshima, T.0 tJournal of food science.g2004 , v. 69, no. 9 p.S414-S417x0022-11477nnas  aDNAL  a20050809b00000000c00000000  aINDdRHFe2005/05/26  aOther US 7aarticle02970naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146072000900164100002100173245008000194300001600274500002400290520139700314650002201711650003001733650003201763650002001795650002501815650002301840650009201863650002001955650001301975650003501988650004702023650002602070650002402096653002202120700001502142700001402157700001402171700001402185700002002199773008202219852000902301856008502310930003302395945002502428946001102453655001202464IND4378875420221119045016.0060317e200511  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437887542DNAL7 a160523212pmid7 a10.1007/s00425-005-0022-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF6001 aSchnitzler, J.P.10aBiochemical properties of isoprene synthase in poplar (Populus x canescens)  ap. 777-786.  aIncludes references  aIsoprene synthase (ISPS) catalyzes the elimination of pyrophosphate from dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMADP) forming isoprene, a volatile hydrocarbon emitted from many plant species to the atmosphere. In the present work, immunological techniques were applied to study and localize ISPS in poplar leaves (Populus x canescens). Immunogold labeling using polyclonal antibodies generated against His-tagged recombinant ISPS protein detected ca. 44% of ISPS in the stroma of the chloroplasts and ca. 56% of gold particles attached to the stromal-facing side of the thylakoid membranes. ISPS isolated from leaves exhibited the same biochemical properties as the recombinant ISPS without the plastid-targeting peptide heterologous expressed in E. coli, whereas an additional C- or N-terminal His-tag changed the biochemical features of the recombinant enzyme with regard to temperature, pH, and substrate dependence. In comparison to the closely related class of monoterpene synthases from angiosperms and ISPS of oaks, the most striking feature of the poplar ISPS is a cooperative substrate dependence which is characteristic to enzymes with positive substrate activation. The detection of four immunoreactive bands in poplar leaf extracts with isoelectric points from 5.0 to 5.5 and a native molecular weight of ca. 51 kDa give reason for future studies on post-translational modifications of ISPS. 3aPopulus canescens 3aalkyl (aryl) transferases 3arecombinant fusion proteins 3aenzyme activity 3aimmunohistochemistry 3aplant biochemistry 2aAlkyl and Aryl Transferasesxchemistryxgeneticsxisolation & purificationxmetabolism. 2aImmunochemistry 2aKinetics 2aPopulusxenzymologyxgenetics. 2aRecombinant Proteinsxchemistryxgenetics. 2aSubstrate Specificity 2aTissue Distribution 0aisoprene synthase1 aZimmer, I.1 aBachl, A.1 aArend, M.1 aFromm, J.1 aFischbach, R.J.0 tPlanta.g2005 Nov., v. 222, no. 5 p.777-786dSpringer-Verlagx0032-09357nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00425-005-0022-13Available from publisher's Web site  a20080210b20080301c00000000  aINDdRSCe2006/03/27  aNon-US 7aarticle02468naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003700092040001800129100001600147245012200163300001600285520110000301650001801401650001701419650001401436650002101450650001601471650001301487650001801500650004401518650001401562650001001576650001301586650002301599650002201622653003101644653001701675653002001692653001301712653002901725700001901754773007001773852000901843856008701852930003301939945001301972946001301985655001201998IND2060999620221119045137.0971222e199705  mnu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206099962DNAL7 a10.1094/CCHEM.1997.74.3.3122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCherian, G.10aAction of oxidants on water sorption, 2H nuclear magnetic resonance mobility, and glass transition behavior of gluten  ap. 312-317.  aOxidation of vital wheat gluten with potassium bromate and ascorbic acid significantly extends or broadens glassy-rubber transition to a higher final temperature range or moisture content. Thermomechanical and deuterium nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) data show that the increased stiffness due to oxidation could be detected from the thermomechanical and deuterium NMR mobility level, indicating increased rigid fractions. The oxidation also resulted in increased water sorption, but no significant change in "freezable" water, and a much decreased mobile deuterium NMR signal. Room temperature sorption of water resulted in a glassy-rubbery transition over a approximate 10-20% mc range for the control. For the oxidized sample, it started at approximately 10%mc, but the transition was gradual and extended into much higher moisture ranges that corresponded to a more rigid fraction of deuterium (NMR) signal. This suggests that the oxidative interactions led to a more rigid gluten fraction, extending the transition to a higher temperature range, perhaps resulting in a more elastic dough. 3awater content 3awheat gluten 3aoxidation 3aphase transition 3atemperature 3aoxidants 3aascorbic acid 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3adeuterium 3awater 3asorption 3asorption isotherms 3apotassium bromate 0athermomechanical processes 0afreezability 0awater relations 0amovement 0aglassy rubber transition1 aChinachoti, P.0 tCereal chemistry.g1997 , v. 74, no. 3 p.312-317x0009-03527nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/CCHEM.1997.74.3.3123Available from publisher's Web site  a20050421b20050501c00000000  aINDdHBI  aOther US 7aarticle02081naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003700092040001800129100001400147245006500161300001600226500001500242520082600257650002101083650001201104650001801116650001601134650001801150650001101168650001201179650001201191650002101203650001101224650001601235653001701251653001501268653001301283653001601296700001601312700001401328700001401342700001801356773007001374852000901444856008701453930003301540945001301573946001301586655001201599IND2060989220221119044918.0971222e199705  mnu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206098922DNAL7 a10.1094/CCHEM.1997.74.3.2492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSingh, V.10aHybrid-dependent effect of lactic acid on corn starch yields  ap. 249-253.  a2019-12-04  aThe effect of lactic acid on starch yields of different corn hybrids was determined by wet-milling 18 commercial corn hybrids at three levels of lactic acid. All 18 hybrid samples tested had higher starch yields when lactic acid was added to the steep solution, although the magnitude of the increased starch yields varied between 2.9 and 12.0%. The optimal lactic acid concentration for maximum starch recovery was found to be between 0.55 and 1.67% lactic acid by wet-milling nine of the same 18 corn hybrids with seven levels of added lactic acid. Between 0.83 and 1.67% lactic acid, the starch yields of eight of the nine hybrids were constant (within +/- 0.5%).

Only BS contained trans fatty acids. After four weeks, serum total cholesterol (T-CH) levels were most elevated in hamsters fed HF. In comparison, hamsters fed BS, BL, or SO showed 13.3, 15.4, or 23.7% reduction in serum T-CH, respectively. Reduction in serum T-CH was even more pronounced in hamsters fed TS. However, this group also showed poor weight gains, apparently because only 16.2% of ingested TS was absorbed. Reduction in T-CH occurred due to reduction of both high-density-lipoprotein (HDL)-CH and non-HDL-CH, but the pattern of reductions still favored lower T-CH-to-HDL- CH ratios. Like T-CH, serum TG levels were also most elevated in hamsters fed HF, with other groups showing significant reductions. Liver CH responses did not conform to responses observed for serum CH and TG levels. Tested in selected baked products prepared in-house, blended fat (BL) was found as functional as regular BS, and it contained no trans fatty acids. 3ahamsters 3adietary fat 3adigestibility 3anutrient intake 3apalm kernel oil 3ablood lipids 3ablood serum 3abody weight 3acottonseed oil 3astearic acid 3atriacylglycerols 3aintestinal absorption 3aplant fats 3afood intake 3aweight gain 3aliver 3asoybean oil 3amixing 3ahigh density lipoprotein 3aexperimental diets 3acholesterol 3aanimal models 0afatty acids 0afat absorption 0adiet1 aGelroth, J.A.1 aLeinen, S.D.0 tCereal chemistry.g1997 , v. 74, no. 3 p.297-299x0009-03527nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/CCHEM.1997.74.3.2973Available from publisher's Web site  a19980101b19980107c00000000  aINDdHBI  aOther US 7aarticle02740naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003700092040001800129100001700147245011300164300001600277520174700293650001902040650001602059650001302075650001602088650001602104650001302120650002502133700001902158773007002177852000902247856008702256930003302343945001302376946001302389655001202402IND2061000420221119045057.0971222e199705  mnu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206100042DNAL7 a10.1094/CCHEM.1997.74.3.3442doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFisher, D.K.10aRetrogradation of maize starch after thermal treatment within and above the gelatinization temperature range  ap. 344-351.  aStudies of starch retrogradation have not considered the initial thermal treatment. In this article, we explore the effect of heating to temperatures within and above the gelatinization range on maize starch retrogradation. In the first experiment, 30% suspensions of waxy (wx) starch were initially heated to final temperatures ranging from 54 to 72 degrees C and held for 20 min. On reheating in the differential scanning calorimeter immediately after cooling, the residual gelatinization endotherm peak temperature increased, the endotherm narrowed, and enthalpy decreased. Samples stored for seven days at 4 degrees C showed additional amylopectin retrogradation endotherms. Retrogradation increased dramatically as initial holding temperature increased from 60 to 72 degrees C. In a second experiment, wx starch was initially heated to final temperatures from 54 to 180 degrees C and rapidly cooled, followed by immediate reheating or storage at 4 degrees C. Maximum amylopectin retrogradation enthalpy after storage was observed for initial heating to 82 degrees C. Above 82 degrees C, retrogradation enthalpy decreased as initial heating temperature increased. A similar effect for ae wx starch was observed, except that retrogradation occurred more rapidly than for wz starch. These experiments show that heating to various temperatures above the range of gelatinization may profoundly affect amylopectin retrogradation, perhaps due to varying extents of residual molecular order in starch materials that are commonly presumed to be fully gelatinized. This article shows that studies of starch retrogradation should take into account the thermal history of the samples even for temperatures above the gelatinization temperature range. 3aheat treatment 3atemperature 3agelation 3aamylopectin 3acorn starch 3agenotype 3apostharvest diseases1 aThompson, D.B.0 tCereal chemistry.g1997 , v. 74, no. 3 p.344-351x0009-03527nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/CCHEM.1997.74.3.3443Available from publisher's Web site  a19980101b19980107c00000000  aINDdHBI  aOther US 7aarticle01136naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001900110245010700129300001600236520031600252650001900568650001700587650001300604650001600617650002100633650001400654650001700668650001100685773006000696852000900756930003300765945001300798946001100811655001200822IND2061017120221119045140.0971224s1996    gw |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206101712DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEdelmann, H.G.10aColeoptile are gravi-guiding systems vital for gravi-insensitive shoots of germinating grass seedlings  ap. 281-282.  aSurgical removal of the coleoptiles from germinating seedlings of Secale cereale L., Avena sativa L., and Zea mays L. leads to a total loss of gravitropic response of the shoot without affecting growth.

This was followed by a transient hyperpolarisation to a value 21 +/- 8 mV more negative than the original membrane potential. The refractory period for the transient depolarisation was between 12 and 15 min. The fluence rate of red light required to evoke maximal depolarisation was about 80 micromoles.m-2.s-1 for a 1-min pulse. At this fluence rate, a depolarising response could be recorded for pulse lengths as small as 7s. The transient depolarisation was insensitive to 3-(3',4'dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethyl urea (DCMU) and was unchanged in plants bleached by growth on norflurazon (SAN 9789). Furthermore, the electrical response could be blocked by simultaneous application of far-red light. These results suggest the involvement of the photoreceptor phytochrome in the response. Removing Ca2+ from the external medium or replacing Ca2+ with Mg2+ blocked the depolarisation. The depolarisation could also be blocked by the K+ channel-blocker tetraethylammonium (10mM) and the Cl- channel-blocker niflumic acid (1 micromolar). Conversely, although calcium channel-antagonists such as nifedipine and lanthanides, applied at a concentration of 100 micromolar, also altered the response, they did not block it. A possible ionic mechanism for the membrane potential transient is advanced, and the physiological significance discussed in the context of early events in the phytochrome signalling pathway. 3afar-red light 3aplasma membrane 3acalcium 3aion exchange 3abranching 3alight intensity 3achlorides 3amagnesium 3amosses and liverworts 3adiuron 3ared light 3anorflurazon 3apotassium 3aphytochrome 3amembrane potential 3ainorganic ions 0acell membranes 0aelectric potential 0adark 0aelectrophysiology 0apolarization1 aHohmeyer, H.1 aJohannes, E.1 aSanders, D.0 tPlanta.g1996, v. 199, no. 3 p.352-358x0032-09357nnas  aDNAL  a19980201b19980206c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle01871naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003700092040001800129100002300147245008200170300001600252520065400268650001800922650001300940650001400953650002100967650001200988650002001000650001101020650002001031650001101051650001401062650001601076653001601092653001401108653001901122653001501141653002801156700001601184773007001200852000901270856008701279930003301366945001301399946001301412655001201425IND2062804820221119044728.0980330e199707  mnu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206280482DNAL7 a10.1094/CCHEM.1997.74.4.3962doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKollengode, A.N.R.10aFlavor retention in pregelantinized and internally flavored starch extrudates  ap. 396-399.  aCorn starch (25% amylose content) was pregelatinized in a twin-screw extruder.

While the cells in the outer layer of the cotyledon were elongated and tightly packed in both garbanzo beans and peas, they were rounder and more loosely packed in the central part of the cotyledon, with many intercellular spaces. Cotyledon cells of garbanzo beans were smaller than those of the pea cultivars. Flour fractions from the inner layer of the cotyledon of garbanzo beans and pea cultivars had much finer particles; were lower in protein, lipid, ash and fiber; and contained more starch than those from the outer layer of the cotyledon. In prime starches isolated from garbanzo beans and smooth peas, protein, free lipid, and ash were lower than 0.41, 0.11, and 0.17%, respectively, indicating that the starches are highly pure. Garbanzo bean starch had smaller and smoother granules than those of smooth peas. Starch granules of wrinkled pea cv. Scout had a unique shape, with deep fissures and grooves, which could be partly responsible for difficulties encountered during the wet fractionation process. 3acultivars 3astarch granules 3adietary fiber 3apeas 3acotyledons 3aparticle size 3ayields 3alipids 3aflour 3afood composition 3achemical constituents of plants 3aultrastructure 3aprotein content 0astarch 0aash 0alegumes1 aBaik, B.K.1 aCzuchajowska, Z.0 tCereal chemistry.g1997 , v. 74, no. 4 p.445-451x0009-03527nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/CCHEM.1997.74.4.4453Available from publisher's Web site  a19980502b19980508c00000000  aINDdHBI  aOther US 7aarticle02959naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001900128245010300147300001600250500001500266520129700281650001701578650001801595650000901613650002101622650002201643650003601665650001401701650001301715650001701728650001801745650001201763650001001775650001101785650002401796650001801820650002301838650002301861650002001884650003601904650002801940650003201968650002402000650002702024653001502051653002802066653002502094653003402119653001902153700001402172700001602186700001702202773006002219852000902279930003302288945001302321946001102334655001202345IND2061014120221119044805.0971224s1996    gw |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206101412DNAL7 a89048052pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMullineaux, P.10aCharacterisation of a glutathione reductase gene and its genetic locus from pea (Pisum sativum L.)  ap. 186-194.  a2019-12-05  aA cDNA encoding the chloroplast/mitochondrial form of glutathione reductase (GR; EC 1.6.4.2) from pea (Pisum sativum L.) was used to map a single GR locus, named GOR1. In two domesticated genotypes of pea (cv. Birte and JI 399) it is likely that the GOR1 locus contains a single gene. However, in a semi-domesticated land race of pea (JI 281) two distinct but closely related sets of GR gene sequences were detected at the GOR1 locus. The extra GR sequences in JI 281 represent either a second intact gene or a partial or pseudogene copy. A GR gene was cloned from cv. Birte, sequenced and its structure analysed. No feature of the transcription or structure of the gene suggested a mechanism for generating any more than one form of GR. From these data plus previously published biochemical evidence we suggest that a second, distinct gene encoding for the cytosolic form of GR should be present in peas. The GOR1-encoded GR mRNA can be detected in all main organs of the plant and no alternative spliced species was present which could perhaps account for the generation of multiple isoforms of GR. The mismatch between the number of charge-separable isoforms in pea and the proposed number of genes suggests that different GR isoforms arise by some form of post-translational modification. 3achloroplasts 3amessenger RNA 3aloci 3astructural genes 3acomplementary DNA 3aglutathione-disulfide reductase 3alandraces 3aisozymes 3amitochondria 3aPisum sativum 3aintrons 3aroots 3aleaves 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aBase Sequence 2aChromosome Mapping 2aCloning, Molecular 2aGene Expression 2aGlutathione Reductasexgenetics 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPeasxenzymologyxgenetics. 2aRestriction Mapping 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 0agor1 locus 0amolecular sequence data 0anucleotide sequences 0aglutathione reductase (NADPH) 0agenbank/x909961 aEnard, C.1 aHellens, R.1 aCreissen, G.0 tPlanta.g1996, v. 200, no. 2 p.186-194x0032-09357nnas  aDNAL  a19980201b19980206c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle02567naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002500092040001800117100002400135245018600159300001600345500002400361520143400385650001301819650000801832650001501840650001201855650003301867650001101900650001101911650002001922650001401942650001001956650002201966650001401988651001402002700001902016773009902035852000902134856003802143655001202181IND4446645120221119044821.0101224s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444664512DNAL7 a10.1071/SB100022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHarrington, Mark G.10aPhylogenetics of hopbushes and pepperflowers (Dodonaea, Diplopeltis - Sapindaceae), based on nuclear ribosomal ITS and partial ETS sequences incorporating secondary-structure models  ap. 431-442.  aIncludes references  aHopbushes and pepperflowers (Dodonaea, Diplopeltis - Sapindaceae) are important components of Australia's arid zone and sclerophyll and temperate forests and woodlands. Phylogenetic analyses of nuclear ribosomal ITS and partial ETS sequences for near-complete sampling of both genera were performed using a Bayesian statistical method and RNA specific models of nucleotide evolution that incorporate secondary structure (separate models for stems and loops). Diplopeltis is paraphyletic. Diplopeltis stuartii is not closer to other species of the genus than it is to species outside the genus. There are also several evolutionary elements in the molecular data that support D. stuartii as distinct from the other members of the genus. The monophyly of Dodonaea as redefined here to include all species of Distichostemon is unequivocally supported by the molecular data and the morphological synapomorphies of petal-less flowers with a highly reduced intrastaminal disk that is absent in staminate flowers. There do not appear to be any obvious evolutionary trends in the morphological characters (leaf and capsule form, presence or absence of aril, or breeding system) that have been previously used to group taxa. However, there are some morphological characters that may be useful to delineate some of the clades recovered in the present molecular study. New combinations in Dodonaea are made for all species of Distichostemon. 3aDodonaea 3aRNA 3aarid zones 3aflowers 3ainternal transcribed spacers 3aleaves 3amodels 3anew combination 3aphylogeny 3astems 3atemperate forests 3awoodlands 3aAustralia1 aGadek, Paul A.0 tAustralian systematic botany.g2010, v. 23, no. 6 p.431-442dCSIRO Publishingx1030-18877nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1071/SB10002 7aarticle03688naa a2200625 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111072000900129072000900138100001600147245007100163300001800234500018500252500002400437520177400461650001902235650002002254650001702274650002002291650000902311650002602320650002102346650002302367650001502390650001002405650000902415650001202424650002102436650001602457650001702473650004602490650001002536650001902546650001102565650002102576650001102597650003902608650000902647650003602656650002102692650004002713650002002753650003902773700002002812700001802832773012002850852000902970930003302979945002503012946001303037655001203050IND4378902620221119045238.0060319e200604  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437890262DNAL7 a165379542pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0aT000 0aT3001 aHuth, P.

These results have culminated in the new (2005) Dietary Guidelines for Americans that now recommend 3 servings of milk products per day to reduce the risk of low bone mass and contribute important amounts of many nutrients that may have additional health attributes beyond bone health. A number of animal, observational, and clinical studies have shown that dairy food consumption can help reduce the risk of hypertension. Clinical trials indicate that the consumption of recommended levels of dairy products, as part of a healthy diet, can contribute to lower blood pressure in individuals with normal and elevated blood pressure. Emerging data also indicate that specific peptides associated with casein and whey proteins can significantly lower blood pressure. In addition, a growing body of evidence has provided support for a beneficial effect of dairy foods on body weight and fat loss. Clinical studies have demonstrated that during caloric restriction, body weight and body fat loss occurs when adequate calcium is provided by supplements and that this effect is further augmented by an equivalent amount of calcium supplied from dairy foods. Several studies support a role for calcium, vitamin D, and dairy foods against colon cancer. Additionally, conjugated linoleic acid, a fatty acid found naturally in dairy fat, confers a wide range of anticarcinogenic benefits in experimental animal models and is especially consistent for protection against breast cancer. 3adairy products 3ahuman nutrition 3ahuman health 3anutritive value 3adiet 3adiet-related diseases 3achronic diseases 3anutrition research 2aAdolescent 2aAdult 2aAged 2aAnimals 2aBody Composition 2aBody Weight 2aBone Density 2aCalcium, Dietaryxadministration & dosage 2aChild 2aDairy Products 2aFemale 2aHealth Promotion 2aHumans 2aHypertensionxprevention & control 2aMale 2aNeoplasmsxprevention & control 2aNutrition Policy 2aNutritional Physiological Phenomena 2aNutritive Value 2aOsteoporosisxprevention & control1 aDiRienzo, D.

Processing large volumes of milk into cheese has necessitated changes in vat size and design, reliance on computer software, and milk standardization, including use of membrane concentration of milk either at the cheese plant or on the farm. There has been increased interest in specialty cheeses including cheese made from sheep, goat, and organic milks. In addition, membrane processing of whey into various value-added components has become routine. Changes in cheese manufacturing protocols have resulted in a reduction of the manufacturing time and the necessity for consistent and reliable starter activity. Major advances in the genetics of microorganisms have not only resulted in widespread use of fermentation-produced chymosin but also in starter bacteria with improved resistance to bacteriophage infection. Genomics and proteomics have increased the likelihood of the development of nonstarter adjuncts with specific enzymatic activity. Indeed, the use of adjunct microorganisms to produce cheese with a unique flavor profile or to produce cheese with more consistent or better quality flavor has gained almost universal acceptance. 3acheesemaking 3aprocessing technology 3aindustry trends 3acheeses 3acheese industry 2aAnimals 2aCheesexmicrobiology 2aDairyingxtrends 2aFermentation 2aFood Handlingxmethods 2aFood Technologyxtrends 2aFood-Processing Industryxtrends 2aGenomics 2aGoats 2aHealth Food 2aLactococcusxgenetics 2aMilkxstandards 2aMilk Proteins 2aProteomics 2aSheep 0aspecialty cheeses 0amembrane processing 0afood technology1 aLucey, J.

Rather than meeting on college campuses, the annual meetings of the ADSA are now held at convention centers that are easily accessible, and are usually held jointly with the American Society of Animal Science. Besides the scientific and social exchanges, regular members and students are recognized for their professional excellence with awards at these meetings. The Student Affiliate Division continues to hold an active meeting along with the parent society. The last 25 yr experienced the termination of the Purina Mills Fellowship Program after 52 yr of support for graduate students. The establishment of an ADSA Foundation has increased resources for enhancement of the ADSA. Newly established DISCOVER Conferences are recipients of Foundation support. The last 25-yr period experienced the development of a formal business arrangement with the American Society of Animal Science and Poultry Science Association that resulted in the establishment of the Federation of Animal Science Societies (FASS), which now houses the 3 societies in its building in Savoy, IL. The Journal of Dairy Science has become the leading journal for publication of dairy science research in the world. The Journal as well as the membership of the ADSA has become increasingly internationalized. Truly, the ADSA has much to celebrate because of its successes in mission during the fourth 25 yr of its history. Its membership can be confident as the ADSA begins its second century of service to the dairy industry. 3adairy science 3aorganizations 3ahistory 3ajournals 3aUnited States 0aAmerican Dairy Science Association Foundation 0aJournal of Dairy Science1 aBoyd, L.

This process appeared to result from an H2O2-mediated oxidative cross-linking mechanism and was initiated within 5 min and complete within 20 min. Further, elicitation of cells induced a rapid, transient generation of H2O2 (oxidative burst), with an onset after 5 min and a maximum H2O2-release after 20 min, as measured by a luminol-dependent chemiluminescence assay. Both chemiluminescence and protein insolubilization were suppressed by exogenous application of catalase or diphenylene iodonium an inhibitor of plasma-membrane NADPH oxidase, respectively. In contrast, exogenous H2O2 mimicked the effect of the elicitor, suggesting that the putative oxidative cross-linking of the proteins depends directly on H2O2 from the oxidative burst. The peroxidase inhibitor salicylhydroxamic acid blocked both the elicitor- and the exogenous-H2O2-stimulated insolubilization, indicating that a peroxidase activity downstream of H2O2-supply is required. The protein kinase inhibitor staurosporine blocked the licitation of the oxidative burst and protein insolubilization In contrast, the protein phosphatase 2A inhibitor cantharidin accelerated, potentiated and extended the elicited oxidative burst. Cantharidin even stimulated the responses in the absence of the elicitor. The competitive effect of both inhibitors confirms that a coordinated activation of protein kinase(s) and counteracting protein phosphates(s) is a poised signal transduction step for the induction of an NADPH-oxidase-dependent oxidative burst. which drives the putative peroxidase-catalyzed cross-linking of the cell wall proteins. 3aCicer arietinum 3acell suspension culture 3aglycoproteins 3ahydroxyproline 3aproline 3ahydrogen peroxide 3aphosphorylation 3aoxidation 3aenzyme inhibitors 3aplant proteins 3acell wall components 0aenzyme activators1 aBarz, W.0 tPlanta.g1996, v. 200, no. 2 p.238-246x0032-09357nnas  aDNAL  a19980201b19980206c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle02337naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003700092040001800129100001600147245006600163300001600229520110700245650001801352650000901370650001201379650001401391650001301405650001801418650001301436650001101449650001101460653001501471653001301486653001901499653001801518653002401536653002701560653002801587653002101615700001801636773007001654852000901724856008701733930003301820945001301853946001301866655001201879IND2062807120221119044809.0980330e199707  mnu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206280712DNAL7 a10.1094/CCHEM.1997.74.4.4842doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMehra, S.K.10aSingle-stage short-duration tempering of corn for dry-milling  ap. 484-488.  aPilot-scale dry-milling runs were conducted to study the feasibility of using a short-duration single-stage tempering procedure for the tempering-degerminating system, instead of the 17.8-21.5 hr of conventional three-stage tempering procedures reported in the scientific literature. Using a Beall degerminator No. 0, pilot-scale dry-milling experiments were conducted at 10 tempering levels: 0, 5, 10, 15, 30, 45, 60, 120, 180, and 240 min. Variation in moisture content of through- and tail-stock fractions, degerminator throughput, ratio of tail- to through-stock, yields of different sized grits from tail- and through-stock fractions, and the recovery of germ and pericarp were used to compare tempering periods. A decrease in the milling action was observed for tempering durations >30 min. A tempering period of 15 min gave the highest grit recovery and a 30-min tempering period resulted in the highest germ and pericarp recovery. Based on these results, it was concluded that short tempering periods of 10-30 min as compared to 17.8-21.5 hr could be used for the tempering-degerminator system. 3awater content 3acorn 3amilling 3atempering 3aduration 3afractionation 3apericarp 3ayields 3amixing 0amaize germ 0arecovery 0apilot projects 0aflaking grits 0atail stock fraction 0athrough stock fraction 0adegerminator throughput 0adevelopment time1 aEckhoff, S.R.0 tCereal chemistry.g1997 , v. 74, no. 4 p.484-488x0009-03527nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/CCHEM.1997.74.4.4843Available from publisher's Web site  a19980502b19980508c00000000  aINDdHBI  aOther US 7aarticle01715naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100001400154245004000168300001600208500016700224520062500391650001501016650002201031650001601053650001201069650001001081650002101091650002001112650001501132700002001147773013701167856005501304961000901359852000901368655001201377IND60691652620221119044917.0200501s2019    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069165262DNAL7 a10.17660/ActaHortic.2019.1252.262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJanet, A.10aFolding photovoltaic shading screen  ap. 201-204.  aPaper presented at the XXI International Congress on Plastics in Agriculture: Agriculture, Plastics and Environment held May 29-31, 1018 Bordeaux-Arcachon, France  aMany studies have been done showing the impact of conventional solar panels on greenhouse tops. Results show that the loss in luminosity in a greenhouse can be up to 64%, compared to a greenhouse without solar panels. The resulting decrease in crop-yield can be significant. To increase efficiency, solar panels should be mobile. In fact, various techniques are already in use in greenhouses, such as white liquid shade on the roof top or mobile sunscreens. These techniques can be duplicated by flexible solar panels/thin films which are programmed to deploy automatically, based on measured sunlight at any given time. 3acrop yield 3afilms (materials) 3agreenhouses 3aliquids 3ashade 3asolar collectors 3asolar radiation 3asunscreens1 aCazauvieilh, J.0 tActa horticulturae.g2019, , no. 1252 p.201-204dInternational Society for Horticultural Science.wJournal:jnl46289x0567-75727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.17660/ActaHortic.2019.1252.26  aUSDA  aDNAL 7aarticle03425naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024002800133040001800161072000900179072000900188100001600197245012100213300001600334500002400350500001500374506007600389520176400465506003702229650001702266650002202283650001402305650002502319650001802344650001102362650002402373650001202397650006802409650002202477650006102499650001402560653001802574700001602592700001702608700001502625773009902640852000902739856007802748930003302826945002502859946001102884655001202895IND4378911520221207072936.0060319e200604  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437891152DNAL7 a164462842pmid7 aPMC28036642pmcid7 a10.1093/aob/mcl0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF600 0aF4001 aNishida, S.12aA comparative study on the anatomy and development of different shapes of domatia in Cinnamomum camphora (Lauraceae)  ap. 601-610.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND AND AIMS: Domatia are small organs usually found in the axils of major veins on the underside of leaves and, although they have received wide attention from ecologists, few detailed reports exist on their anatomy or development. This study is focused on the domatia of Cinnamomum camphora (Lauraceae) and is the first comparative study on the anatomy and development of the different shapes of domatia within a single plant. METHODS: Four types of domatia in C. camphora leaves were observed on paraffin sections under a microscope. KEY RESULTS: The domatia consisted of six histological parts: the upper epidermis, the upper mesophyll tissue, spongy tissue, the lower mesophyll tissue, the tissue filling the rim opening, and the lower epidermis. They differed from the non-domatial lamina mainly in the cell structure of the upper and lower mesophyll tissue and the rim tissue. Differences in domatium shapes were mainly associated with differences in the structure of the upper mesophyll and in the number and size of the rim tissue cells. Differences in the development of domatium types were observed in terms of initiation timing, differentiation of the upper mesophyll cells and degree of rim tissue development. CONCLUSIONS: In domatia, active anticlinal division in the lower mesophyll cells, as compared with the upper mesophyll cells, was coordinated with dynamic growth of rim tissue cells and resulted in cavity formation. The anatomical or developmental differences among the four types of domatia were related to the positions of the domatia within a leaf. In terms of the ecological implications, the major anatomical difference between the domatia used by herbivorous and carnivorous mites was in the development of the rim tissue.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aplant growth 3aplant development 3ahistology 3adevelopmental stages 3acell division 3aleaves 3aCinnamomum camphora 2aAnimals 2aCinnamomum camphoraxanatomy & histologyxgrowth & development. 2aMitesxphysiology 2aPlant Leavesxanatomy & histologyxgrowth & development. 2aSymbiosis 0aplant anatomy1 aTsukaya, H.1 aNagamasu, H.1 aNozaki, M.0 tAnnals of botany.g2006 Apr., v. 97, no. 4 p.601-610dOxford University Pressx0305-73647nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/aob/mcl0093Available from publisher's Web site  a20060329b20060402c00000000  aINDdMKSe2006/03/28  aNon-US 7aarticle03688naa a2200685 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024002800133040001800161100002400179245014200203300001800345500002400363506007600387520158900463506003702052650001602089650001202105650002802117650001502145650001302160650001202173650001502185650001002200650001202210650001002222650001202232650001202244650000902256650001702265650001202282650001702294650002202311650002402333650001202357650003902369650002502408650002402433650002502457650002202482650002202504650001102526650002802537650003202565650004302597650002302640650002402663650002602687650001902713700001802732700001902750700001802769773011602787852000902903856007802912655001202990IND4461354320221207072924.0110812e201108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446135432DNAL7 a215864312pmid7 aPMC31536872pmcid7 a10.1093/jxb/err1582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMitani-Ueno, Namiki14aThe aromatic/arginine selectivity filter of NIP aquaporins plays a critical role in substrate selectivity for silicon, boron, and arsenic  ap. 4391-4398.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aNodulin-26-like intrinsic proteins (NIPs) of the aquaporin family are involved in the transport of diverse solutes, but the mechanisms controlling the selectivity of transport substrates are poorly understood. The purpose of this study was to investigate how the aromatic/arginine (ar/R) selectivity filter influences the substrate selectivity of two NIP aquaporins; the silicic acid (Si) transporter OsLsi1 (OsNIP2;1) from rice and the boric acid (B) transporter AtNIP5;1 from Arabidopsis; both proteins are also permeable to arsenite. Native and site-directed mutagenized variants of the two genes were expressed in Xenopus oocytes and the transport activities for Si, B, arsenite, and water were assayed. Substitution of the amino acid at the ar/R second helix (H2) position of OsLsi1 did not affect the transport activities for Si, B, and arsenite, but that at the H5 position resulted in a total loss of Si and B transport activities and a partial loss of arsenite transport activity. Conversely, changes of the AtNIP5;1 ar/R selectivity filter and the NPA motifs to the OsLsi1 type did not result in a gain of Si transport activity. B transport activity was partially lost in the H5 mutant but unaffected in the H2 mutant of AtNIP5;1. In contrast, both the single and double mutations at the H2 and/or H5 positions of AtNIP5;1 did not affect arsenite transport activity. The results reveal that the residue at the H5 position of the ar/R filter of both OsLsi1 and AtNIP5;1 plays a key role in the permeability to Si and B, but there is a relatively low selectivity for arsenite.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aArabidopsis 3aXenopus 3aamino acid substitution 3aaquaporins 3aarginine 3aarsenic 3aboric acid 3aboron 3afilters 3agenes 3amutants 3aoocytes 3arice 3asilicic acid 3asilicon 3atransporters 2aAmino Acid Motifs 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAnimals 2aAquaporinsxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aArgininexmetabolism 2aArsenicxmetabolism 2aBiological Transport 2aBlotting, Western 2aBoronxmetabolism 2aFemale 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aMutant Proteinsxmetabolism 2aPlant Proteinsxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aSequence Alignment 2aSiliconxmetabolism 2aSubstrate Specificity 2aXenopus laevis1 aYamaji, Naoki1 aZhao, Fang-Jie1 aMa, Jian Feng0 tJournal of experimental botany.g2011 Aug., v. 62, no. 12 p.4391-4398dOxford University Pressx0022-09577nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jxb/err1583Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02735naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100001600154245021100170300001600381500016700397520116500564650001601729650002701745650001001772650001201782650002401794650002701818650001401845650002101859650002001880650001101900650002501911650001401936650000901950650001101959650001101970650001301981651001401994700001402008700001702022700001602039773013702055856005502192961000902247852000902256655001202265IND60691653220221119044938.0200501s2019    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069165322DNAL7 a10.17660/ActaHortic.2019.1252.322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDieguez, G.10aEvaluación de la dinamica de absorción de calcio, magnesio y azufre en el cultivo de la cebolla (Allium cepa L.), en suelo con acolchado plástico, caserío El Rodeo, El Progreso, Jutiapa, Guatemala, C.A.  ap. 245-250.  aPaper presented at the XXI International Congress on Plastics in Agriculture: Agriculture, Plastics and Environment held May 29-31, 1018 Bordeaux-Arcachon, France  aThe effect of plastic mulch on onion crop (Allium cepa L.), on the absorption of calcium, magnesium and sulphur, was evaluated; thus, also on the yield and quality, for which an experimental design of paired plots with 12 repetitions was used. The treatments were with padding and without padding. The response variables were performance, quality, and nutritional content (Ca, Mg, S). To determine the nutritional content, seven samples were taken, which were taken at 0 (seedlings), 15, 33, 56, 71, 84 and 98 days after the transplant. The yield and quality were analysed statistically by a simple covariance analysis due to the irregularity of the number of plants caused by the tropical storm Agatha. The experiment was carried out in the village of El Rodeo, municipality of El Progreso, Jutiapa, Guatemala, C.A. The results indicated that the use of plastic mulch compared with the cultivation in soil without quilting, increased the total yield in 18.92 and in 38.06% the proportion of bulbs of first quality. This also improved the efficiency of fertilizer use, with increases of 52.34, 24.80 and 67.33% for calcium, magnesium and sulphur, respectively. 3aAllium cepa 3aanalysis of covariance 3abulbs 3acalcium 3aexperimental design 3afertilizer application 3amagnesium 3anutrient content 3anutrient uptake 3aonions 3aplastic film mulches 3aseedlings 3asoil 3astorms 3asulfur 3avillages 3aGuatemala1 aD., Omar,1 aCastillo, S.1 aDimitri, I.0 tActa horticulturae.g2019, , no. 1252 p.245-250dInternational Society for Horticultural Science.wJournal:jnl46289x0567-75727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.17660/ActaHortic.2019.1252.32  aUSDA  aDNAL 7aarticle02431naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245025200126300001600378500001500394520117200409650001801581650002401599650001501623650002201638650002501660650002001685650002001705650002001725650001901745650001401764650001901778653001901797653001701816700001301833700001701846700002001863773006001883852000901943930003301952945001301985946001101998655001202009IND2060887020221119045219.0971215s1996    gw |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206088702DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKubicki, A.10aDifferential expression of plastome-encoded ndh genes in mesophyll and bundle-sheath chloroplasts of the C4 plant Sorghum bicolor indicates that the complex I-homologous NAD(P)H-plastoquinone oxidoreductase is involved in cyclic electron transport  ap. 276-281.  a2019-12-05  aCyanobacteria and plastids harbor a putative NAD(P)H- or ferredoxin-plastoquinone oxidoreductase that is homologous to the NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase (complex I) of mitochondria and eubacteria. The enzyme is a multimeric protein complex that consists of at least 11 subunits (NDH-A-K) and is localized in the stroma lamellae of the thylakoid membrane system. We investigated the expression of the different subunits of the enzyme in mesophyll and bundle-sheath chloroplasts of Sorghum bicolor [L.] Moench, a C4 plant of the NADP-malic enzyme type. The relative amounts of the subunits NDH-H, -J and -K were strongly increased in bundle-sheath plastids as compared to mesophyll plastids. This increase was accompanied by enhanced transcript levels for all subunits except NDH-I. Because the main function of the protein complexes in the thylakoid membranes of bundle-sheath chloroplasts (photosystem I, cytochrome b6/f-complex and ATPase) is the generation of ATP for CO2 fixation via cyclic electron transport, we conclude that the NAD(P)H/ferredoxin-plastoquinone oxidoreductase is an essential component of the cyclic electron-transport pathway in chloroplasts. 3amessenger RNA 3abundle sheath cells 3athylakoids 3aelectron transfer 3abiochemical pathways 3aoxidoreductases 3agene expression 3aSorghum bicolor 3aphotosynthesis 3amesophyll 3aplant proteins 0acell membranes 0achloroplasts1 aFunk, E.1 aWesthoff, P.1 aSteinmuller, K.0 tPlanta.g1996, v. 199, no. 2 p.276-281x0032-09357nnas  aDNAL  a19980101b19980107c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle02856naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004300092040001800135072000900153072000900162072000900171100001300180245012200193300001600315500002400331520170500355650001402060650001002074650001502084650001202099650001202111650001602123650002002139653002202159700001202181773009402193852000902287856009302296930003302389945002502422946001102447655001202458IND4384000220221119045218.0061003e20060310xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438400022DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aquaculture.2005.07.0172doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL200 0aM001 0aM1201 aYang, H.10aPolyploid induction by heat shock-induced meiosis and mitosis inhibition in the dwarf surfclam, Mulinia lateralis Say  ap. 171-182.  aIncludes references  aHeat shock is an effective and widely used method for polyploid induction in fish, but has not been well studied in molluscs. In this study, heat shock was tested for polyploid induction through meiosis or mitosis inhibition in the dwarf surfclam, Mulinia lateralis Say. To determine the most effective temperature, different heat shocks (32, 35 and 38 °C) were applied to newly fertilized eggs at 8-11 min post-fertilization (MPF) to inhibit the extrusion of polar body 1 (PB1), and ended when the second polar body began to form in control groups. Ploidy of resultant larvae was determined by flow cytometry (FCM). Both 35 °C and 38 °C were effective in inhibiting PB1, but 38 °C led to complete mortality of larvae. Heat shock of 32 °C only accelerated embryonic development without inhibiting PB1, as all resultant larvae were diploid. High percentages of triploids (86.3-98.5%) were produced by the 35 °C treatment as detected at the juvenile stage. Different durations (10, 15 and 20 min) of the 35 °C heat shock were used for PB1-inhibition to test effects on polyploid formation, which produced primarily triploids (10 min) and pentaploids (20 min), but virtually no tetraploids. To inhibit mitosis I (M1) and mitosis II (M2) for tetraploid induction, a heat shock of 35 °C was applied to fertilized eggs at 35-37 and 50-57 MPF for about 20 min, producing up to 82.8% and 44.4% tetraploid larvae, respectively. Most tetraploid larvae were abnormal and did not develop to the D-stage, and no tetraploids were observed at the juvenile stage. This study shows that heat shock is a highly effective method for polyploid induction in the dwarf surfclam and possibly in other molluscs also. 3aMactridae 3aclams 3apolyploidy 3ameiosis 3amitosis 3aheat stress 3amollusc culture 0aMulinia lateralis1 aGuo, X.0 tAquaculture.g2006 Mar. 10, v. 252, no. 2-4 p.171-182dElsevier Pub.

We investigated a simple way to preserve the genetic variability i.e. the choice of appropriate mating schemes, when pedigrees are unknown. We used computer simulations to compare the ability of different mating systems to preserve genetic variability in populations undergoing selection. The model used for data simulation was a simple polygenic additive model which did not take into account maternal effect, inbreeding depression and unbalanced family sizes. The mating systems considered were full factorial, partial factorial, nested and single pair matings. The evolution of additive genetic variability was studied at two different levels of heritability (0.1; 0.5), two different population sizes (1000 or 5000 animals), 30 generations of selection and different combinations of number of sires/number of dams. Results showed that the various mating designs did differ in terms of long-term genetic variability and genetic response. For the same selection pressure, designs which created the highest number of families were the most efficient. Thus, factorial designs were the most efficient and single pair designs were the least efficient. However, differences between full factorial and partial factorial designs were small. When possible, partial factorial mating (FS) designs seemed to be a good compromise to achieve high genetic responses while preserving genetic variability. Further studies dealing with effect of inbreeding depression, maternal effects or unbalanced family sizes should complete our present results. 3afish culture 3amaternal effect 3asimulation models 3ainbreeding 3aheritability 3agenetic variation 3aanimal breeding 3ainbreeding depression 0amathematical models1 aVandeputte, M.1 aHaffray, P.1 aChevassus, B.0 tAquaculture.g2006 Mar. 10, v. 252, no. 2-4 p.161-170dElsevier Pub.

These binding partners produce a trans-synaptic bridge that facilitates maturation and specification of synapses. It is believed that there exists an optimal spatio-temporal code of neurexin and neuroligin interactions that guide synapse formation in the postnatal developing brain. Therefore, we investigated whether neuroligins and neurexin are differentially regulated by sensory input using a behavioural model system with an advanced capacity for sensory processing, learning and memory, the honeybee. Methodology/Principal Findings: Whole brain expression levels of neuroligin 1–5 (NLG1–5) and neurexin I (NrxI) were estimated by qRT-PCR analysis in three different behavioural paradigms: sensory deprivation, associative scent learning, and lateralised sensory input. Sensory deprived bees had a lower level of NLG1 expression, but a generally increased level of NLG2–5 and NrxI expression compared to hive bees. Bees that had undergone associative scent training had significantly increased levels of NrxI, NLG1 and NLG3 expression compared to untrained control bees. Bees that had lateralised sensory input after antennal amputation showed a specific increase in NLG1 expression compared to control bees, which only happened over time. Conclusions/Significance: Our results suggest that (1) there is a lack of synaptic pruning during sensory deprivation; (2) NLG1 expression increases with sensory stimulation; (3) concomitant changes in gene expression suggests NrxI interacts with all neuroligins; (4) there is evidence for synaptic compensation after lateralised injury.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aApis mellifera 3ahoney bees 3abrain 3agene expression 3ainsect proteins 3agenes 3ainsect behavior 3aodors 3alearning 3asynapse 2aAlternative Splicing 2aAnimals 2aAssociation Learningxphysiology 2aBeesxgeneticsxmetabolismxphysiology. 2aBrainxmetabolismxphysiology. 2aCell Adhesion Molecules, Neuronalxgeneticsxmetabolismxphysiology. 2aFemale 2aGene Expression Profiling 2aInsect Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolismxphysiology. 2aMale 2aMembrane Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolismxphysiology. 2aNerve Tissue Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolismxphysiology. 2aOdorants. 2aOlfactory Pathwaysxphysiology 2aProtein Binding 2aReflexxphysiology 2aReverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction 2aSensory Receptor Cellsxphysiology 2aSmellxphysiology 2aSynapsesxphysiology 0aneuroligins 0aNLG1-5 gene 0anrxI gene 0aneurexins 0asensory deprivation 0aassociative scent training 0alateral sensory input1 aReinhard, Judith1 aOakeshott, John1 aRussell, Robyn1 aSrinivasan, Mandyam V.1 aClaudianos, Charles0 tPloS one.g2010 Feb., v. 5, no. 2x1932-62037nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.00091333Available from publisher's Web site  a20110603b20110701c00000000  aINDdRHFe2010/04/13  aOther US 7aarticle04242naa a2200685 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024003800133040001800171072001700189100002300206245014700229506007600376520204700452506003702499650002302536650001702559650002302576650002002599650002002619650002602639650001802665650001002683650002502693650002002718650000902738650003102747650001202778650002402790650001102814650002102825650003002846650004602876650002402922650002402946650004502970650002203015650004903037650004403086650001403130650000903144650001703153653002203170653002403192653002303216700001803239700002303257700002103280700001903301773005603320852000903376856008803385930003303473945002503506946001303531655001203544IND4435394020221207064312.0100416e200909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443539402DNAL7 a197870712pmid7 aPMC27499342pmcid7 a10.1371/journal.pone.00072712doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

It has been suggested that the trajectory of development is shifted by alterations in the maternal nutritional state leading to changes in developmental plasticity, in part underpinned by epigenetic changes in gene regulation. However, to date, only candidate gene approaches have been used to assess expression and molecular changes in the offspring of maternally undernourished animals. Furthermore, most work has focused on animals at an age where the programmed phenotype is already manifest and little is known about changes in gene expression in the offspring prior to development of obesity and related metabolic disorders. Gene expression profiles of liver, retroperitoneal white adipose fat, and biceps femoris skeletal muscle tissue from young adult male rats (55 days old) in which nutritional status had been manipulated in utero by maternal undernutrition (UN) were compared to the profiles of offspring of ad libitum fed mothers serving as the control group (AD) (8 offspring/group). The expression profiles were determined using the Illumina RatRef-12 BeadChip. No significant changes in expression were identified for skeletal muscle or white adipose tissue. However, studies of liver tissue showed 249 differentially expressed genes (143 up regulated, 106 down regulated). Although the animals at day 55 have yet to develop obesity they already show biochemical abnormalities and by day 110 express a phenotype characterized by increased adiposity and altered insulin sensitivity. An analysis of pathways affected suggests that intrauterine programming of UN animals to favor fat as an energy source results in mitochondrial dysfunction which initially affects the postnatal hepatic function and subsequently, via the resultant metabolic changes in other organs leads to the evolution of a phenotype similar to that of the metabolic syndrome.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3amaternal nutrition 3amalnutrition 3arestricted feeding 3aanimal genetics 3agene expression 3amicroarray technology 3amessenger RNA 3aliver 3awhite adipose tissue 3askeletal muscle 3arats 2aAdipose Tissuexmetabolism 2aAnimals 2aEpigenesis, Genetic 2aFemale 2aFood Deprivation 2aGene Expression Profiling 2aGene Expression Regulation, Developmental 2aGlucosexmetabolism 2aInsulinxmetabolism 2aInsulin-Like Growth Factor Ixmetabolism 2aLiverxmetabolism 2aMaternal Nutritional Physiological Phenomena 2aOligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis 2aPhenotype 2aRats 2aRats, Wistar 0agene upregulation 0agene downregulation 0aprenatal nutrition1 aVickers, Mark1 aGluckman, Peter D.1 aGilmour, Stewart1 aAffara, Nabeel0 tPloS one.g2009 Sept., v. 4, no. 9x1932-62037nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.00072713Available from publisher's Web site  a20100607b20100703c00000000  aINDdRHFe2010/06/07  aOther US 7aarticle02821naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004300092040001800135072000900153072000900162072000900171072000900180072000900189072000900198100001800207245008600225300001600311500002400327500001500351520121500366650002201581650001801603650002201621650001301643650002501656650002401681650003101705650001701736650002201753650001101775650002001786650003101806650001901837653002801856653001901884653003001903653002501933700001401958700001801972773009401990852000902084856009302093930003302186945002502219946001102244655001202255IND4383999620221119044803.0061003e20060310xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438399962DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aquaculture.2005.07.0242doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL600 0aL200 0aL833 0aM001 0aM120 0aL0011 aPhongdara, A.10aMolecular cloning and expression of caspase from white shrimp Penaeus merguiensis  ap. 114-120.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aApoptosis is a fundamental cellular process that plays a critical role in normal development and tissue homeostasis, eliminating from an organism unwanted cells, including damaged and virus-infected cells. In order to investigate the significance of apoptosis in response to viral infections in crustacean, we have cloned a caspase gene (cap-3) from the white shrimp, Penaeus merguiensis infected with white spot syndrome virus (WSSV). The deduced amino acid sequence of the protein named CAP-3 was 320 amino acids in length and contained the highly conserved pentapeptide QACRG recognized as the active site of caspase. CAP-3 showed similarities to the insect caspase, Spodoptera frugiperda Sf caspase-1 and the caspases of Spodoptera littoralis, Bombyx mori, Drosophila melanogaster and Anopheles gambiae, which in turn belong to the group of human caspase-3, caspase-7 and CED-3. The recombinant CAP-3 protein prepared from Escherichia coli had enzymatic activity when assayed using a luminescent substrate specific for the cleavage target site for human caspase-3, implying that CAP-3 functioned as caspase-3. There was a high level of expression of this gene product in moribund shrimp infected with WSSV. 3asequence analysis 3amessenger RNA 3acomplementary DNA 3acaspases 3aamino acid sequences 3awhite spot syndrome 3aFenneropenaeus merguiensis 3aactive sites 3amolecular cloning 3ashrimp 3aenzyme activity 3agene expression regulation 3ashrimp culture 0amolecular sequence data 0ashrimp farming 0aWhite spot syndrome virus 0acysteine proteinases1 aWanna, W.1 aChotigeat, W.0 tAquaculture.g2006 Mar. 10, v. 252, no. 2-4 p.114-120dElsevier Pub.

  1 aGaravaglia, Betiana S.12aA Eukaryotic-Acquired Gene by a Biotrophic Phytopathogen Allows Prolonged Survival on the Host by Counteracting the Shut-Down of Plant Photosynthesis  a2019-12-05  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aXanthomonas citri pv. citri, the bacteria responsible for citrus canker posses a biological active plant natriuretic peptide (PNP)-like protein, not present in any other bacteria. PNPs are a class of extracellular, systemically mobile peptides that elicit a number of plant responses important in homeostasis and growth. Previously, we showed that a Xanthomonas citri pv. citri mutant lacking the PNP-like protein XacPNP produced more necrotic lesions in citrus leaves than wild type infections and suggested a role for XacPNP in the regulation of host homeostasis. Here we have analyzed the proteome modifications observed in citrus leaves infected with the wild type and XacPNP deletion mutant bacteria. While both of them cause down-regulation of enzymes related to photosynthesis as well as chloroplastic ribosomal proteins, proteins related to defense responses are up-regulated. However, leaves infiltrated with the XacPNP deletion mutant show a more pronounced decrease in photosynthetic proteins while no reduction in defense related proteins as compared to the wild-type pathogen. This suggests that XacPNP serves the pathogen to maintain host photosynthetic efficiency during pathogenesis. The results from the proteomics analyses are consistent with our chlorophyll fluorescence data and transcript analyses of defense genes that show a more marked reduction in photosynthesis in the mutant but no difference in the induction of genes diagnostic for biotic-stress responses. We therefore conclude that XacPNP counteracts the shut-down of host photosynthesis during infection and in that way maintains the tissue in better conditions, suggesting that the pathogen has adapted a host gene to modify its natural host and render it a better reservoir for prolonged bacterial survival and thus for further colonization.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aproteome 3ahost-pathogen relationships 3alesions (plant) 3apeptides 3abacterial diseases of plants 3aoranges 3aCitrus sinensis 3abacterial proteins 3acankers (plants) 3aphotosynthesis 3aleaves 3aXanthomonas citri 2aCitrusxmicrobiology 2aElectrophoresis, Gel, Two-Dimensional 2aGenes, Plant 2aHomeostasis 2aPhotosynthesis 2aPlant Leavesxmetabolism 2aPlant Proteinsxmetabolism 2aProteome 2aSpectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization 2aXanthomonasxphysiology 0aXanthomonas citri pv. citri 0asigns and symptoms (plants) 0aplant natriuretic peptide1 aThomas, Ludivine1 aGottig, Natalia1 aDunger, Germán1 aGarofalo, Cecilia G.1 aDaurelio, Lucas D.1 aNdimba, Bongani1 aOrellano, Elena G.1 aGehring, Chris1 aOttado, Jorgelina0 tPloS one.g2010 Jan., v. 5, no. 1x1932-62037nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.00089503Available from publisher's Web site  a20100414b20100501c00000000  aINDdRHFe2010/04/13  aOther US 7aarticle02797naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119072000900137100001600146245015700162300001800319500002400337500001500361520137600376650002201752650001301774650001801787650003101805650000901836650001201845653004301857653001701900653003701917653002101954700001601975700001801991700002302009700001502032773016302047852000902210856006102219930003302280945002502313946001302338655001202351IND4383994920140723000000.0061002e20060823xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438399492DNAL7 a10.1021/jf060964v2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aS2001 aGautz, L.D.10aDetermination of Kavalactones in Dried Kava (Piper methysticum) Powder Using Near-Infrared Reflectance Spectroscopy and Partial Least-Squares Regression  ap. 6147-6152.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aKava (Piper methysticum Forst F.), or àwa in the Hawaiian language, has been used for thousands of years by the people of the South Pacific Islands, in particular Fiji, Vanuatu, Tonga, and Samoa, for social and ceremonial occasions. Kava has the unique ability to promote a state of relaxation without the loss of mental alertness. Kava recently became part of the herbal pharmacopoeia throughout the United States and Europe because of its anxiolytic properties. The active compounds are collectively called kavalactones (or kava pyrones). The need for a less time-consuming and costly method to determine the concentration of kavalactones in dried kava is urgent. The combination of near-infrared reflectance spectroscopy (NIRS) and partial least-squares (PLS) methods has been found to be a convenient, versatile, and rapid analytical tool for determination of kavalactones in dried kava powder. Calibration equations were developed based on the analyses of 110 samples with variable physical and chemical properties collected over time from Hawaii kava growers and validated by analyses of a set of 12 samples with unknown kavalactones concentration. All six major kavalactones and the total kavalactones were measured using NIRS with accuracy acceptable for commercial use. The NIRS measurements are reproducible and have a repeatability on a par with HPLC methods. 3aPiper methysticum 3alactones 3aleast squares 3anear-infrared spectroscopy 3akava 3apowders 0anear-infrared reflectance spectroscopy 0akavalactones 0apartial least squares regression 0aherbal medicines1 aKaufusi, P.1 aJackson, M.C.1 aBittenbender, H.C.1 aTang, C.S.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2006 Aug. 23, v. 54, no. 17 p.6147-6152dAmerican Chemical Society, Books and Journals Division]x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf060964v3electronic resource  a20070327b20070402c00000000  aINDdRHFe2007/03/27  aOther US 7aarticle02889naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024003800133040001800171072001700189100001900206245008700225500001500312506007600327520115600403506003701559650002501596650001801621650003701639650003201676650002001708650002601728650003201754650004901786650003301835650002501868650001801893650002001911650002601931653002601957653001601983653002201999653003702021700001802058700002502076700002302101773005502124852000902179856008802188930003302276945002502309946001302334655001202347IND4434746720221207065813.0100330e201002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443474672DNAL7 a201617022pmid7 aPMC28169962pmcid7 a10.1371/journal.pone.00090892doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aVu, Giang T.H.10aBAC-HAPPY Mapping (BAP Mapping): A New and Efficient Protocol for Physical Mapping  a2019-12-05  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aPhysical and linkage mapping underpin efforts to sequence and characterize the genomes of eukaryotic organisms by providing a skeleton framework for whole genome assembly. Hitherto, linkage and physical “contig” maps were generated independently prior to merging. Here, we develop a new and easy method, BAC HAPPY MAPPING (BAP mapping), that utilizes BAC library pools as a HAPPY mapping panel together with an Mbp-sized DNA panel to integrate the linkage and physical mapping efforts into one pipeline. Using Arabidopsis thaliana as an exemplar, a set of 40 Sequence Tagged Site (STS) markers spanning ~10% of chromosome 4 were simultaneously assembled onto a BAP map compiled using both a series of BAC pools each comprising 0.7x genome coverage and dilute (0.7x genome) samples of sheared genomic DNA. The resultant BAP map overcomes the need for polymorphic loci to separate genetic loci by recombination and allows physical mapping in segments of suppressed recombination that are difficult to analyze using traditional mapping techniques. Even virtual “BAC-HAPPY-mapping” to convert BAC landing data into BAC linkage contigs is possible.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aDNA libraries 3abacterial artificial chromosomes 3aphysical chromosome mapping 3agenetic markers 2aArabidopsisxgenetics 2aChromosome Mappingxmethods 2aChromosomes, Artificial, Bacterialxgenetics 2aChromosomes, Plantxgenetics 2aDNA, Plantxgenetics 2aGenome, Plant 2aGenomic Library 2aSequence Tagged Sites 0asequence tagged sites 0aBAP mapping 0aBAC HAPPY mapping 0agenetic techniques and protocols1 aDear, Paul H.1 aCaligari, Peter D.S.1 aWilkinson, Mike J.0 tPloS one.g2010 Feb., v. 5, no. 2x1932-62037nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.00090893Available from publisher's Web site  a20110603b20110701c00000000  aINDdRHFe2010/04/13  aOther US 7aarticle02187naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001500145245011400160300001600274520105700290650002101347650002001368650002201388650001701410650002301427650001201450650002001462650001701482650002301499651001201522773010301534852000901637856008501646930003301731945001301764946001301777990002301790655001201813IND2163851720221120085859.0980904e199712  cau|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND216385172DNAL7 a10.1177/1077727X9702620052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, A.W.10aMothers' attitudes toward pasteurized and sterilized, aseptically packaged milks for their preschool children  ap. 193-206.  aIn 1995, 56 mothers whose children were enrolled in preschool programs in Athens, Georgia, completed a questionnaire regarding their attitudes about sterilized, aseptically packaged milk containers and their suitability for children, their liking for milk, and their children's liking for milk. Mothers significantly preferred snack-size (236.5 ml) containers of sterilized, aseptically packaged milk for children during snacktime at home and away from home. Mothers requested additional information regarding recyclability of the package, nutritional comparisons of sterilized, aseptically packaged milk to pasteurized milk, and processing procedures for sterilized, aseptically packaged milk. A majority of the mothers reported that their children liked flavored milk. Among the flavors, a majority chose chocolate to use mainly as a snack. No correlations were found between maternal reports and results from sensory tests with children for liking of milk. The mean hedonic score of the children's acceptance of milk was 87.1 on a scale of 0 to 100. 3apasteurized milk 3asterilized milk 3aaseptic packaging 3afood beliefs 3apreschool children 3amothers 3afood processing 3amilk quality 3afood acceptability 3aGeorgia0 tFamily and consumer sciences research journal.g1997 Dec., v. 26, no. 2 p.193-206x1077-727X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1077727X9702620053Available from publisher's Web site  a19981102b19981110c00000000  aINDdTHW  aOther US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle01970naa a2200493 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024001800097040001800115100002800133245009200161300001600253300002300269520058100292650002700873650001600900650002600916650002300942650001200965650001000977650001500987650001001002650003701012650001101049650003001060650001101090650002601101650003301127650000901160650001601169650001701185700001901202700002501221700002301246700001901269700002101288773009201309852000901401930003301410945000801443946001301451655001201464991615786990742620221120075403.0830224e19820708xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI830015462DNAL7 a70880362pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPonz de Leon, Maurizio.10aInfluence of small-bowel transit time on dietary cholesterol absorption in human beings  ap. 102-103.  ap. 102-103. chart.  aCholesterol absorption factors are not fully understood. Guinea pig studies suggest that rapid intestinal transit time allows less absorption, and thus less tissue accumulation.

Thirty-three inpatients participated in the study; 8 females and 25 males ranging in age between 16-55 (N=39).

An enamel microbiopsy was performed, and the enamel microbiopsies were then analyzed by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and Polarizing Microscopy (PM). Quantitative birefringence measurements were performed. The “true” etched area was determined by measuring the etched enamel using the NIH Image analysis program. Enamel birefringence was compared using the paired t test. There was a statistically significant difference when the etched areas in the Rehydrated teeth were compared with those of the Dry teeth (p =0.04). The etched areas varied from -11.6% to 73.5% of the presumed area in the Rehydrated teeth, and from 6.6% to 61.3% in the Dry teeth. The mean percentage of variation in each group could be used as a correction factor for the etched area. Analysis of PM pictures shows no evidence of in-depth enamel demineralization by the etching solution. No statistically significant differences in enamel birefringence were observed between values underneath and outside the microbiopsy area in the same tooth, showing that no mineral loss occurred below the enamel superficial layer. Our data showed no evidence of in-depth enamel demineralization by the etching solution used in the enamel microbiopsy proposed for primary enamel. This study also showed a variation in the measured diameter of the enamel microbiopsy in nineteen teeth out of twenty four, indicating that in most cases the etching solution penetrated beyond the tape borders. 3aimage analysis 3at-test 3ateeth 3ascanning electron microscopy 3aenamel 2aDental Enamelxultrastructure 2aHumans 2aMicroscopyxmethods 2aMicroscopy, Electron, Scanningxmethods 0aStudent's t-test1 aMolina, Gabriela Ferian1 aMeschiari, César Arruda1 aBarbosa de Sousa, Frederico1 aGerlach, Raquel Fernanda0 tScience of the total environment.g2009 Sept. 1, v. 407, no. 18 p.5169-5175dElsevier Sciencex0048-96977nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2009.04.0443Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle01796naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001200145245004900157300001600206520083300222650001301055650002301068650002101091650002401112651001801136653001201154700001301166773010301179852000901282856008501291930003301376945001301409946001301422990002301435655001201458IND2180741720221120052715.0981030e199803  cau|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND218074172DNAL7 a10.1177/1077727X9802630042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCho, J.10aConsumers' attitudes toward clothing coupons  ap. 328-345.  aCouponing has been widely used in many product categories but not for clothing products. This research investigates the feasibility of clothing coupons by studying consumers' attitudes toward clothing coupon and buying intentions toward a coupon-promoted brand. Data collected from 170 participants reveal that the majority of the respondents have favorable attitudes toward clothing coupons and strong buying intentions toward a coupon-promoted brand. Significant relationships are found between a consumer's attitude toward clothing coupons and coupon proneness, number of children, education, and household income. Although consumers' brand loyalty is not significantly related to their attitude toward clothing coupons, it is significantly related to the level of consumers' buying intentions toward a coupon-promoted brand. 3aclothing 3aconsumer attitudes 3aconsumer surveys 3abrand name products 3aUnited States 0acoupons1 aKang, J.0 tFamily and consumer sciences research journal.g1998 Mar., v. 26, no. 3 p.328-345x1077-727X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1077727X9802630043Available from publisher's Web site  a19981201b19981208c00000000  aINDdTHW  aOther US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle02176naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003400092040001800126072001700144072001700161100001800178245005500196300001600251520105300267650002201320650002201342650002501364650001501389650001501404650001801419650001501437650002401452650001401476651001201490773012401502852000901626856008401635930003301719945002501752946001301777655001201790IND4385042820221120041715.0061107e200609  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438504282DNAL7 a10.1198/108571106X1287762doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aRathbun, S.L.10aSpatial prediction with left-censored observations  ap. 317-336.  aEnvironmental monitoring of contaminants often involves left-censored observations falling below the minimum detection limits (MDLs) of the instruments used to assay their concentrations. Statistical procedures for handling left-censored observations generally assume that the observations are independently distributed. However, data collected over a spatial network of sample sites are likely to be spatially correlated. This correlation structure can be exploited to obtain improved imputations of left-censored observations, and hence improved estimates of environmental parameters. This article applies a Robbins-Monro algorithm for estimating the parameters of a spatial regression model. This algorithm uses importance sampling to obtain conditional simulations of left-censored observations. A predictor for data at unsampled sites is obtained by taking the weighted mean of kriging predictors computed from independent importance samples. The proposed methods are illustrated using data from the South Florida Ecosystem Assessment Project. 3aplant communities 3aspecies diversity 3aspatial distribution 3aecosystems 3aprediction 3ageostatistics 3aalgorithms 3amathematical models 3aequations 3aFlorida0 tJournal of agricultural, biological, and environmental statistics.g2006 Sept., v. 11, no. 3 p.317-336x1085-71177nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1198/108571106X1287763Available from publisher's Web site  a20070814b20070902c00000000  aINDdMKSe2007/08/14  aOther US 7aarticle02499naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002200152245008800174300001800262520123600280650003301516650001501549650001501564650000901579650002501588650002601613650001401639650001401653650001801667653002101685653002901706700002601735700002001761700002101781700002201802773012001824852000901944856009201953930003302045946001102078655001202089IND4422666920221123015708.0090703e200907  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442266692DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2109.2009.02208.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFrancis, David S.10aEffects of alternate phases of fish oil and vegetable oil-based diets in Murray cod  ap. 1123-1134.  aFish oil (FO)- and canola oil (CO)-based diets were regularly alternated in a daily cycle (amCO: alternation of CO in the morning and FO in the afternoon, and pmCO: alternation of FO in the morning and CO in the afternoon) or in a series of weekly cycles (2W: alternation of 2 weeks on CO and 2 weeks on FO, 4W: alternation of 4 weeks on CO and 4 weeks on FO), over a 16-week period in juvenile Murray cod (Maccullochella peelii peelii).

These data point towards the existence of cyclical mechanisms relative to fatty acid utilization/retention. 3aMaccullochella peelii peelii 3acanola oil 3acod (fish) 3adiet 3adocosahexaenoic acid 3aeicosapentaenoic acid 3afish oils 3ajuveniles 3avegetable oil 0afeeding schedule 0alipo-compensatory growth1 aTurchini, Giovanni M.1 aSmith, Blair K.1 aRyan, Stephen G.1 aDe Silva, Sena S.0 tAquaculture research.g2009 July, v. 40, no. 10 p.1123-1134dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx1355-557X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2109.2009.02208.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20090703b20090801c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02272naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001900152245007300171300001600244520123400260650001201494650001301506650000901519650001501528650001301543650001501556650002101571653001301592653000901605653002001614653001601634773011501650852000901765856009201774930003301866946001101899655001201910IND4428951220221123015618.0091120e200912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442895122DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1467-2979.2009.00327.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBull, Leigh S.10aNew mitigation measures reducing seabird by-catch in trawl fisheries  ap. 408-427.  aThis paper provides an update on an earlier review [Fish & Fisheries 8 (2007) 31] of mitigation methods used to reduce seabird by-catch in trawl fisheries. Interactions of seabirds with trawl vessels fall into two broad categories: those focused on the trawl warps and those focused around trawl nets. For reducing seabird strikes on trawl warps, the use of bird-scaring lines has been proved to be the most effective mitigation device in the trawl fisheries in which comparative studies have been undertaken. However, the retention or strategic management of fish waste (offal and discards) is recommended as the most effective primary measure for by-catch reduction, and as such should be viewed as the best long-term solution to reducing seabird by-catch in trawl fisheries. Coincident with effective fish waste management, measures such as cleaning the net prior to shooting and reducing the time the net is on the surface should be viewed as best practice measures and incorporated into normal fishing activities. While a number of methods have been trialled to reduce the incidence of warp strikes, there continues to be the need for more work on effective measures for reducing interactions of seabirds with the trawl net. 3abycatch 3acleaning 3afish 3afish waste 3aseabirds 3atrawl nets 3awaste management 0aBy-catch 0anets 0atrawl fisheries 0awarp cables0 tFish and fisheries.g2009 Dec., v. 10, no. 4 p.408-427dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx1467-29607nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-2979.2009.00327.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20091120b20091204c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02714naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002100145245010400166300001800270520147000288650001301758650003001771650001601801650002501817650002201842650002301864650001501887650001601902651001301918653003801931653002001969653002201989700002502011700002402036773011802060852000902178856008502187930003302272946001102305655001202316IND4424975620221123015656.0090821e200909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442497562DNAL7 a10.1007/s10040-009-0445-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSibanda, Tenant 10aComparison of groundwater recharge estimation methods for the semi-arid Nyamandhlovu area, Zimbabwe  ap. 1427-1441.  aThe Nyamandhlovu aquifer is the main water resource in the semi-arid Umguza district in Matebeleland North Province in Zimbabwe. The rapid increase in water demand in the city of Bulawayo has prompted the need to quantify the available groundwater resources for sustainable utilization. Groundwater recharge estimation methods and results were compared: chloride mass balance method (19-62 mm/year); water-table fluctuation method (2-50 mm/year); Darcian flownet computations (16-28 mm/year); ¹⁴C age dating (22-25 mm/year); and groundwater modeling (11-26 mm/year). The flownet computational and modeling methods provided better estimates for aerial recharge than the other methods. Based on groundwater modeling, a final estimate for recharge (from precipitation) on the order of 15-20 mm/year is believed to be realistic, assuming that part of the recharge water transpires from the water table by deep-rooted vegetation. This recharge estimate (2.7-3.6% of the annual precipitation of 555 mm/year) compares well with the results of other researchers. The advantages/disadvantages of each recharge method in terms of ease of application, accuracy, and costs are discussed. The groundwater model was also used to quantify the total recharge of the Nyamandhlovu aquifer system (20 x 10⁶-25 x 10⁶ m³/year). Groundwater abstractions exceeding 17 x 10⁶ m³/year could cause ecological damage, affecting, for instance, the deep-rooted vegetation in the area. 3aaquifers 3aatmospheric precipitation 3agroundwater 3agroundwater recharge 3ahydrologic models 3aradiocarbon dating 3avegetation 3awater table 3aZimbabwe 0aGroundwater recharge/water budget 0aGroundwater age 0aNyamandhlovu area1 aNonner, Johannes C. 1 aUhlenbrook, Stefan 0 tHydrogeology journal.g2009 Sept., v. 17, no. 6 p.1427-1441dBerlin/Heidelberg : Springer-Verlagx1431-21747nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10040-009-0445-z3Available from publisher's Web site  a20090821b00000000c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03265naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001600152245009000168300001600258520163900274650002601913650002601939650002301965650001901988650001902007650002402026650001702050650001002067650001202077650001002089650001202099650001202111650001202123650002802135650002102163650001802184650001502202650001002217650001102227650001402238651001602252651001002268653002602278653002802304653001802332653002302350700001702373700001602390700001502406773012102421852000902542856009202551930003302643946001102676655001202687IND4420133420221123001946.0090508e200906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442013342DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2494.2009.00684.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aScotton, M.10aSeed production of an Arrhenatherion elatioris hay-meadow in the eastern Italian Alps  ap. 208-218.  aDue to agricultural intensification, semi-natural Arrhenatherion elatioris meadows are becoming rare in central Europe. Despite the increasing importance of their biodiversity value, little information is available on seed production which could be used to enlarge their regional presence. To contribute to this knowledge, the seed production of the major grass species were analysed for the spring growths of an Arrhenatherion elatioris meadow in 2003 and 2004. In the first study year, fertile culms of Anthoxanthum odoratum, Arrhenatherum elatius, Avenula pubescens, Dactylis glomerata, Holcus lanatus and Trisetum flavescens were collected on different dates and analysed for their reproductive efficiency. Floret site utilization was greater than 0·60 for all species and seed viability was above 80%, except for A. odoratum. Seed dormancy was present to a small extent only in A. odoratum and A. pubescens. With regard to the whole meadow, the density of fertile stems amounted to 850 m⁻² (811 m⁻² of which were grasses) and standing seed yield at seed maturity of the six grasses was about 33 100 seeds m⁻². As a consequence of the increase in viability occurring during seed development, the maximum standing viable seed yield was reached later. The total number of seeds produced throughout the spring growth period was 2·8 times that of the maximum standing seed yield. The quality and quantity of the seed production from spring growth make it suitable for establishing species-rich semi-natural grassland provided that seed obtained from the second cut is included to increase the presence of legumes and forbs. 3aAnthoxanthum odoratum 3aArrhenatherum elatius 3aDactylis glomerata 3aHelictotrichon 3aHolcus lanatus 3aTrisetum flavescens 3abiodiversity 3aculms 3aflorets 3aforbs 3agrasses 3alegumes 3ameadows 3areproductive efficiency 3aseed development 3aseed dormancy 3aseed yield 3aseeds 3aspring 3aviability 3aAlps region 3aItaly 0afertile stems density 0afloret site utilization 0agerminability 0ainflorescence size1 aPiccinin, L.1 aDainese, M.1 aSancin, F.0 tGrass and forage science.g2009 June, v. 64, no. 2 p.208-218dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0142-52427nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2494.2009.00684.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20090508b20090608c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02731naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001700145245011700162300001800279500002400297520147200321650002001793650001301813650001301826650001901839650001101858650001301869650002301882650002301905650002201928650002501950650000701975650001801982650002202000650002002022650001302042700001502055700001702070773012802087852000902215856008502224655001202309IND4424359720221122225413.0090808s2009    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442435972DNAL7 a10.1007/s11274-009-0047-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Jinxia10aRemoval of toxic chromate using free and immobilized Cr(VI)-reducing bacterial cells of Intrasporangium sp.

In this study, a novel chromate-reducing bacterium was isolated from Mn/Cr-contaminated soil. Based on morphological, physiological/biochemical characteristics and 16S rRNA gene sequence analyses, this strain was identified as Intrasporangium sp. strain Q5-1. This bacterium has high Cr(VI) resistance with a MIC of 17 mmol l⁻¹ and is able to reduce Cr(VI) aerobically. The best condition of Cr(VI) reduction for Q5-1 is pH 8.0 at 37°C. Strain Q5-1 is also able to reduce Cr(VI) in resting (non-growth) conditions using a variety of carbon sources as well as in the absence of a carbon source. Acetate (1 mmol l⁻¹) is the most efficient carbon source for stimulating Cr(VI) reduction. In order to apply strain Q5-1 to remove Cr(VI) from wastewater, the bacterial cells were immobilized with different matrices. Q5-1 cells embedded with compounding beads containing 4% PVA, 3% sodium alginate, 1.5% active carbon and 3% diatomite showed a similar Cr(VI) reduction rates to that of free cells. In addition, the immobilized Q5-1 cells have the advantages over free cells in being more stable, easier to re-use and minimal clogging in continuous systems. This study provides potential applications of a novel immobilized chromate-reducing bacterium for Cr(VI) bioremediation. 3aIntrasporangium 3aacetates 3abacteria 3abioremediation 3acarbon 3achromium 3acontinuous systems 3adiatomaceous earth 3aimmobilized cells 3anucleotide sequences 3apH 3aribosomal RNA 3asequence analysis 3asodium alginate 3atoxicity1 aHe, Minyan1 aWang, Gejiao0 tWorld journal of microbiology & biotechnology.g2009 Sept., v. 25, no. 9 p.1579-1587dSpringer Netherlandsx0959-39937nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11274-009-0047-x3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02958naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100003100145245013600176300001800312500002400330500001500354520165900369650002002028650001602048650001802064650002102082650001702103650001302120650002202133650001402155650001702169650002102186653001602207700001702223700003202240700003302272700002102305773012802326852000902454856008502463655001202548IND4424359920221122220421.0090808s2009    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442435992DNAL7 a10.1007/s11274-009-0049-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRodriguez Estrada, Alma E.10aEnhancement of the antioxidants ergothioneine and selenium in Pleurotus eryngii var. eryngii basidiomata through cultural practices  ap. 1597-1607.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aAntioxidants are molecules that may reverse, prevent or slow cellular damage caused by free radicals. Increasing dietary intake of antioxidants is thought to reduce oxidative stress that may contribute to the development of several diseases. Mushrooms are known to contain antioxidants such as selenium, ergothioneine and phenolics that may serve this role. Here we sought to enhance selenium and ergothioneine concentration in Pleurotus eryngii var. eryngii basidiomata by modifying the techniques used for their commercial cultivation. To enhance selenium content in mushrooms, substrates were supplemented with sodium selenite (Na₂SeO₃) to reach selenium concentrations of 5 and 10 μg/g. Basidiomata of one commercial isolate (WC888) accumulated selenium up to 4.6 and 9.3 μg/g (d.w.), respectively. Therefore, a serving size (85 g) of fresh P. eryngii mushrooms produced on substrates supplemented with 5 and 10 μg/g of Na₂SeO₃ would supply 70.4 and 116.3% of the daily value of selenium (DV = 70 μg), respectively. Since selenium-enriched mushrooms would supply more than 20% of the DV, they could be considered an excellent source of selenium. Ergothioneine concentration was enhanced in mushrooms produced on low-moisture (55%) substrate compared to the commonly used 60% (high-moisture) in commercial cultivation. Mushrooms produced on low-moisture substrate had ergothioneine concentrations of 3.0 mg/g, while mushrooms produced on high-moisture substrate contained 2.2 mg/g or less. Use of a casing overlay for mushroom production resulted in significant yield increases on low-moisture substrate but not on high-moisture substrate. 3asodium selenite 3abasidiomata 3afree radicals 3amushroom growing 3aserving size 3aselenium 3aPleurotus eryngii 3amushrooms 3aantioxidants 3aoxidative stress 0abasidiocarp1 aLee, Hyun-Ju1 aBeelman, R.

This new system is found to form complexes with the electron-deficient guests, trinitrobenzene (TNB) and picric acid (PA), which serve as models for nitroaromatic explosives. The binding phenomenon, which has been studied in organic solution using proton nuclear magnetic resonance and absorption spectroscopies, results in an easy-to-visualize color change in chloroform that is independent of the presence of chloride anion, a known interferant for an earlier tetrakisTTF-calix[4]pyrrole TNB chemosensor. Support for the proposed binding mode comes from a preliminary solid state structure of the complex formed from TNB, namely TNB[subset or is implied by]3. A color change is also observed when dichloromethane solutions of chemosensor 3 are added to solvent-free samples of TNB, PA, and 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene supported on silica gel.

The consequences of methanogenesis in the rumen may result in the low productivity and possibly will have a negative impact on the sustainability of the ruminant's production. Since enteric fermentation emission is one of the major sources of methane and is influenced by a number of environmental factors, diet being the most significant one, a number of in vitro and in vivo trials have been conducted with different feed supplements (halogenated methane analogues, bacteriocins, propionate enhancers, acetogens, fats etc.) for mitigating methane emissions directly or indirectly, yet extensive research is required before reaching a realistic solution. Keeping this in view, the present article aimed to cover comprehensively the different aspects of rumen methanogenesis such as the phylogeny of methanogens, their microbial ecology, factors affecting methane emission, mitigation strategies and need for further study. 3abacteriocins 3aecosystems 3aenergy 3aenvironmental factors 3afeed supplements 3afermentation 3alipids 3amethane 3amethane production 3amethanogens 3amicrobial ecology 3aphylogeny 3apropionic acid 3arumen 3aruminants1 aPuniya, Anil Kumar1 aPuniya, Monica1 aDagar, Sumit Singh1 aSirohi, Sunil Kumar1 aSingh, Kishan1 aGriffith, Gareth Wyn0 tWorld journal of microbiology & biotechnology.g2009 Sept., v. 25, no. 9 p.1557-1566dSpringer Netherlandsx0959-39937nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11274-009-0041-33Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02478naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001400145245014800159300001600307500001500323520107500338650001601413650001901429650001301448650001101461650002001472650002601492650001301518650003501531650002401566650004301590650000701633650002701640653002101667700001701688700001601705700001901721700001901740773013501759852000901894856008501903930003301988946001102021655001202032IND4424986320221122143546.0090821e200909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442498632DNAL7 a10.1007/s00216-009-2962-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSun, Yan 10aIon-pairing high-performance liquid chromatography determination of amitrole in apple after solid-phase extraction and precolumn derivatization  ap. 465-471.  a2019-12-04  aA novel method based on solid-phase extraction was studied for the extraction of amitrole (3-amino-1,2,4-triazole), and its residue determination in apples has been developed. The samples were derivatized with 4-chloro-3,5-dinitrobenzotrifluoride (CNBF). The derivatization conditions and the influence of elution composition on the separation were investigated. In pH 9.5 H₃BO₃-Na₂B₄O₇ media, the reaction of amitrole with CNBF was complete at 60°C after 30 min. The separation of derivatized amitrole was achieved at room temperature within 13 min by gradient elution mode with cetyltrimethylammonium bromide in mobile phase as ion-pair reagent. The method correlation coefficient was 0.9996, in concentrations ranging from 1.66 to 415 mg L⁻¹. The calculated recoveries of the proposed method were from 94.17% to 105.67%, and relative standard deviations were 1.57% to 6.44% in the application to the quantitative determination of amitrole in apples. The detection limit of amitrole was 0.10 mg L⁻¹ with a signal-to-noise ratio of 3.

Recently, we have reported on the sustained dosing of molecules into single cells via a microscopic diffusion port. Here we describe temporal ratiometry, a method to reconstruct intracellular concentration distribution of the delivered molecules as it varies in time during dosing. To characterize this method, we analyzed fluorescence intensity maps obtained during delivery of Lucifer Yellow CH, LY, a polar fluorophore into A7r5 vascular smooth muscle cells, normal rat kidney epithelial cells (NRKE), and MCF-7 human breast cancer cells. Temporal ratiometry indicates a linear increase in concentration of LY in these cells with a nearly uniform distribution during 20 min of delivery. The method cancels the effects of varying cell height and variable accessible volume on the measured intensities at different locations within the cell. Temporal ratiometry will be useful to estimate dynamic changes in intracellular concentration distributions and thus, facilitate the understanding of transport, binding, sequestration, and efflux of molecules introduced into cells. 3abreast neoplasms 3aepithelial cells 3afluorescence 3afluorescent dyes 3ahumans 3akidneys 3amyocytes 3aneoplasm cells 3arats 3asmooth muscle1 aGratzl, Mikl[small omicron, accent, Greek]s 0 tAnalytical and bioanalytical chemistry.g2009 Sept., v. 395, no. 2 p.449-456dBerlin/Heidelberg : Springer-Verlagx1618-26427nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00216-009-2961-z3Available from publisher's Web site  a20090821b00000000c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02654naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002000145245010900165300001600274520135100290650002101641650001101662650002601673650002201699650001301721650001601734650002601750650001301776650001301789650002301802650002401825650000901849650001701858651001301875700001801888700002201906700001901928773013501947852000902082856008502091930003302176946001102209655001202220IND4424985820221122143557.0090821e200909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442498582DNAL7 a10.1007/s00216-009-2882-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTamiri, Tsippy 10aUrea nitrate, an exceptionally easy-to-make improvised explosive: studies towards trace characterization  ap. 421-428.  aUrea nitrate is a powerful improvised explosive, frequently used by terrorists in the Israeli arena. It was also used in the first World Trade Center bombing in New York in February 1993. It is difficult to identify urea nitrate in post-explosion debris, since only a very small fraction survives the blast. Also, in the presence of water, it readily decomposes to its original components, urea and nitric acid. It is suspected that post-blast debris of urea nitrate can be confused with ammonium nitrate, the main solid product of urea nitrate thermal decomposition. In a comprehensive study towards identification of urea nitrate in post-blast traces, a spectrophotometric technique for quantitative determination of urea nitrate was developed, and conditions were found for extraction and separation of un-exploded traces of urea nitrate with minimal decomposition. Nevertheless, out of 28 samples collected from a series of three controlled firings of urea nitrate charges, only one gave the typical adduct ion by liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry analysis. We found that urea nitrate can be extracted from solid mixtures to organic solvents by using Crown ethers as “host compounds.” The adducts thus formed are solid, crystalline compounds that can be characterized by microanalysis and spectroscopic techniques.

It appears that the 6-7 year periodicity that prevailed in this region from 1960s up to 1980s has now vanished in all species. The grouse data are modelled using a linear autoregressive model with lag terms for population dynamics including grouse harvest as annual bag and an index of winter severity (winter-time area of Baltic Sea ice cover). We use the Akaike information criterion for selecting the best model for each species; first order lag is forced to the models. It turns out that a term is needed for harvesting (with a negative coefficient) in models for all species. For the capercaillie and the hazel grouse second order lag was included, for the black grouse and the willow grouse first order lag suffices. The willow grouse is the only species where the index of winter strength (with a negative coefficient) is needed in the model. 3aSalix nigra 3aTetrao urogallus 3abags 3agrouse 3aharvesting 3aice 3alinear models 3aperiodicity 3apopulation dynamics 3aBaltic Sea 3aFinland1 aRanta, Esa1 aMönkkönen, Mikko1 aLindén, Harto.1 aHelle, Pekka0 tOikos.g2011 July, v. 120, no. 7 p.1057-1064dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0030-12997nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1600-0706.2010.18788.x 7aarticle01782naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002200152245005500174300001600229500002400245520090000269650002301169650002101192650000901213650001101222650001201233650002301245650001201268651001801280773010601298852000901404856005501413655001201468IND4445655120221122052051.0101126e201011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444565512DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1574-0862.2010.00500.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTyner, Wallace E.14aThe integration of energy and agricultural markets  ap. 193-201.  aIncludes references  aThis article addresses the evolving links between energy and agricultural markets. Prior to 2005, there was little correlation between energy and agricultural commodity prices. In 2006-2008, with the ethanol boom in the United States, there emerged a strong link between crude oil, gasoline, and corn prices. There was little link between ethanol and corn. However, in late 2008 and 2009, the markets changed as ethanol production came under severe economic pressure and 2 billion out of 12 billion gallons of capacity shut down. During this period ethanol became priced more on corn, as the breakeven corn price helped drive the ethanol market. This article explores the drivers in these markets as well as other major issues facing the corn ethanol industry in the United States such as the blend wall.

In addition, the recombinant E. coli also produced, albeit at low concentration, a range of dopamine derivatives such as feruloyldopamine due to THT's ability to accept dopamine as a substrate. 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aEscherichia coli 3abioactive properties 3adopamine 3agenes 3ahydroxycinnamoyltransferase 3apepper 3asecretion 3atyramine 2aAcyltransferasesxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aArabidopsisxenzymologyxgenetics. 2aCaffeic Acidsxmetabolism 2aCoenzyme A Ligasesxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aCoumaric Acidsxmetabolism 2aCulture Mediaxchemistry 2aEscherichia colixgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aGene Expression 2aRecombinant Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aTyraminexanalogs & derivativesxmetabolism.1 aPark, Munyoung1 aPark, Sangkyu1 aKim, Yŏng-sun.1 aLee, Sungbeom1 aLee, Seong-Gene1 aBack, Kyoungwhan0 tBiotechnology letters.g2009 Sept., v. 31, no. 9 p.1469-1475dSpringer Netherlandsx0141-54927nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10529-009-0032-33Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02257naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002000164245010600184300001800290500002400308520071300332650002501045650001301070650001301083650001101096650001001107650001301117650004001130650004701170650003701217650002801254650002401282650001801306650005201324650005601376700002201432700001701454700002101471700001901492700002101511700001901532700002601551773010401577852000901681856008501690655001201775IND4424341620221122092642.0090808s2009    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442434162DNAL7 a194886772pmid7 a10.1007/s10529-009-0031-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVilla, Federica10aN-vanillylnonanamide tested as a non-toxic antifoulant, applied to surfaces in a polyurethane coating  ap. 1407-1413.  aIncludes references  aThe potential on N-vanillylnonanamide (NVN) in preventing the attachment of Pseudomonas stutzeri and a Bacillus cereus-group strain was investigated.

A considerable number of mammalian long ncRNAs have now been isolated but only a small number of these nucleic acids have been functionally well characterized. In this study, to determine the structure, regulation and function of long ncRNA in pigs, TncRNA was isolated from this mammal and its potential function during pig foetus development was identified. We anticipated that this would provide new insights into functional genomic studies in the pig. Using LongSAGE libraries generated from Chinese indigenous Tongcheng and Landrace pigs at three prenatal stages, a novel porcine long ncRNA was identified, TncRNA, which was found to be differentially expressed during myogenesis. The full-length cDNA for this gene is 3409 bp, and it harbours a typical polyadenylation signal sequence located 18 bp upstream from the 3' poly (A) tail. Genomic sequence analysis showed that pig TncRNA is alternatively spliced and several transcripts were detected. Using the INRA-University of Minnesota porcine radiation hybrid panel, TncRNA was assigned to SSC2 and found to be closely linked to the microsatellite marker SW256. Porcine TncRNA was found to be expressed in all tissues examined but in variable amounts. Comparisons between the expression profiles of TncRNA at different development stages in Tongcheng and Landrace pigs revealed up-regulation of this molecule in prenatal skeletal muscle, and differential expression in 90-day-old foetal skeletal muscle between these two pig breeds. This is the first report to describe a long ncRNA in pig. Moreover, the distinct expression pattern and structure of porcine TncRNA suggest that it performs complex and critical functions during foetal development. 3aalternative splicing 3achromosome mapping 3acomplementary DNA 3adevelopmental stages 3agenes 3agenetic markers 3agenomics 3ahybrids 3alandraces 3amuscle development 3anon-coding RNA 3anucleotide sequences 3asequence analysis 3asignal peptide 3askeletal muscle 3aswine 3aswine breeds 2aAlternative Splicing 2aAnimals 2aChromosome Mapping 2aChromosomes, Mammalian 2aGene Library 2aGenome 2aNucleic Acid Conformation 2aPhylogeny 2aRNA, Untranslatedxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aSwinexgenetics 3aMinnesota 0aidentification 0along ncRNA 0amolecular characterization 0aTncRNA1 aLi, Y.1 aTang, Z.1 aYang, S.1 aMu, Y.1 aCui, W.1 aAo, H.1 aDu, L.1 aWang, L.1 aLi, K.0 tAnimal genetics.g2009 Aug., v. 40, no. 4 p.499-508dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0268-91467nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2052.2009.01868.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20090714b20090801c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02482naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002200145245010100167300001400268520141800282650001501700650001801715650002601733650001801759650001801777650001101795650002001806650002001826650002001846650001701866773010901883852000901992856008502001930003302086946001302119655001202132IND4424967620221122005908.0090821e200909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442496762DNAL7 a10.1007/s12033-009-9184-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrooks, Susan A. 10aStrategies for Analysis of the Glycosylation of Proteins: Current Status and Future Perspectives  ap. 76-88.  aMore than half of human proteins are glycosylated by a bewildering array of complex and heterogeneous N- and O-linked glycans. They function in myriad biological processes, including cell adhesion and signalling and influence the physical characteristics, stability, function, activity and immunogenicity of soluble glycoproteins. A single protein may be glycosylated differently to yield heterogenous glycoforms. Glycosylation analysis is of increasing interest in biomedical and biological research, the pharmaceutical and healthcare industry and biotechnology. This is because it is increasingly apparent that glycosylation changes in diseases, such as cancer, making it a promising target for development of clinically useful biomarkers and therapeutics. Furthermore, as the non-human cells employed in expression systems glycosylate their proteins very differently to human cells, and as glycosylation changes unpredictably under changing environmental conditions, glycans analysis for quality control, optimum efficacy and safety of recombinant glycoproteins destined for human therapeutic use is paramount. The complexities of carbohydrate chemistry make analysis challenging and while there are a variety of robust methodologies available for glycan analysis, there is currently a pressing need for the development of new, streamlined, high throughput approaches accessible to non-specialist laboratories. 3abiomarkers 3acell adhesion 3aenvironmental factors 3aglycoproteins 3aglycosylation 3ahumans 3aimmune response 3apolysaccharides 3aquality control 3atherapeutics0 tMolecular biotechnology.g2009 Sept., v. 43, no. 1 p.76-88dNew York : Humana Press Incx1073-60857nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12033-009-9184-63Available from publisher's Web site  a20090821b00000000c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02066naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001600145245015300161300001400314520095100328650001701279650001501296650002801311650002201339650001801361700001901379700001701398700001601415700001701431700001901448773010901467852000901576856008501585930003301670946001301703655001201716IND4424967420221122005839.0090821e200909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442496742DNAL7 a10.1007/s12033-009-9176-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Yaojun 10aNucleic Acids in Protein Samples Interfere with Phosphopeptide Identification by Immobilized-Metal-Ion Affinity Chromatography and Mass Spectrometry  ap. 59-66.  aImmobilized-metal-ion affinity chromatography (IMAC) is used extensively for phosphopeptide enrichment in phosphoproteomics. However, the effect of nucleic acids in protein samples on phosphopeptide enrichment by IMAC has not yet been well clarified. In this study, we demonstrate that IMAC beads possess a strong adsorption of nucleic acids, especially single-stranded or single-stranded-region-containing nucleic acids, leading to approximately 50% loss of phosphopeptides during the process of IMAC enrichment. Therefore, nucleic acids must be removed from protein samples prior to IMAC. Acetonitrile (ACN) precipitation, a simple and efficient procedure, was established to remove nucleic acids from the protein samples. We showed that ACN precipitation approximately doubled the phosphopeptide number identified by IMAC and mass spectrometry, indicating that nucleic acid removal significantly improves the identification of phosphopeptides. 3aacetonitrile 3aadsorption 3aaffinity chromatography 3amass spectrometry 3anucleic acids1 aLuo, Yuanming 1 aWu, Shuzhen 1 aGao, Youhe 1 aLiu, Yanxin 1 aZheng, Dexian 0 tMolecular biotechnology.g2009 Sept., v. 43, no. 1 p.59-66dNew York : Humana Press Incx1073-60857nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12033-009-9176-63Available from publisher's Web site  a20090821b00000000c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02662naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001900145245010400164300001400268520112200282650001901404650001601423650002501439650001901464650002001483650002101503650001801524650001301542650002501555650001801580650001001598650002001608650001201628650000901640650001101649650001801660650002501678650001401703650001101717700001701728700001901745700002401764700001801788700001801806700002301824700002401847773010901871852000901980856008501989930003302074946001302107655001202120IND4424967320221122005927.0090821e200909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442496732DNAL7 a10.1007/s12033-009-9175-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHong, Sun Mee 10aMolecular Characterization, Localization, and Distribution of Innexins in the Silkworm, Bombyx mori  ap. 52-58.  aGap junctions that allow for a direct exchange of second messenger and ions are the most conserved cellular structures in multicellular organisms. We have isolated and characterized a Bombyx mori gene innexin3 that encodes a new member of the innexin family required for the early embryonic development. The BmINX3 mRNA was 1,814 nucleotide residues in length, and the deduced amino acid sequence of BmInx3 shared 74% similarity with Apis melifera innexin3. The expression profile of the BmINX3 mRNA is similar to that of previously described BmINX2, expressed in ovary and testis after 5th instar larvae and in fat body after gut purge. However, during embryogenesis, the expression of BmINX3 mRNA is restricted to the blastokinesis stage. Microscopic observation of the BmInx2 and BmInx3 fused to fluorescent proteins showed an overlapping cytoplasmic expression, whereas the BmInx4 is accumulated in the cytoplasmic surface at which two cells have physical contact. This finding of innexins distribution in silkworm would provide an essential basis for future studies of the functions and interactions of innexins. 3aApis mellifera 3aBombyx mori 3aamino acid sequences 3aanimal ovaries 3acell structures 3adigestive system 3aembryogenesis 3afat body 3afluorescent proteins 3agap junctions 3agenes 3ainsect proteins 3ainstars 3aions 3alarvae 3amessenger RNA 3anucleotide sequences 3asilkworms 3atestes1 aNoh, Si Kab 1 aKim, Kyung A. 1 aMitsunobu, Hitoshi 1 aMon, Hiroaki 1 aLee, Jae Man 1 aKawaguchi, Yutaka 1 aKusakabe, Takahiro 0 tMolecular biotechnology.g2009 Sept., v. 43, no. 1 p.52-58dNew York : Humana Press Incx1073-60857nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12033-009-9175-73Available from publisher's Web site  a20090821b00000000c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02925naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245008400127300001600211500012700227500002400354520148000378650001001858650001901868650001901887650001101906650001301917650001401930650002301944650001801967650001001985650001001995650001302005650001702018650002402035650001202059650002702071650001002098650001002108650001202118651001402130700001902144700001702163700001502180700001902195773012202214852000902336856008602345655001202431IND4471886120221121234306.0130916s2013    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447188612DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBendokas, V.10aApplication of p gene donors in breeding of blackcurrant resistant to gall mite  ap. 523-527.  aPaper presented at the XIII Eucarpia Symposium on Fruit Breeding and Genetics, held September 11-15, 2011, Warsaw, Poland.  aIncludes references  aBlackcurrants constitute the most important small fruit crop for horticultural production and present a popular choice for home gardens in Lithuania. Twenty-eight blackcurrant cultivars were released and a large number of perspective progeny was developed over fifty years of the blackcurrant breeding program at the Institute of Horticulture, LRCAF. Resistance to pests and diseases is one of the major goals for blackcurrant breeding, and resistance to gall-mite and fungal diseases were the most important traits for development of new breeding selections (clones) and cultivars. An investigation of inheritance of disease resistance in interspecific hybrids of genus Ribes revealed species useful as donors of gall mite resistance genes. Although crosses of R. nigrum ssp. sibiricum, R. ussuriense and R. janczewskii resulted in F1 hybrids resistant to gall mite, no hybrids with agronomical value were identified. Further emphasis was put on the development of complex genotypes, including traits from the European and Siberian blackcurrant genomes and selection for field resistance through several generations. Crossing of R. nigrum ssp. europaeum, R. dikuscha and R. nigrum ssp. sibiricum progenies in two generations resulted in development of several resistant cultivars, with 'Dainiai' being the cultivar of high fruit quality and complete resistance to gall mite. Approximately 10% of hybrids of high breeding value were obtained from crosses including 'Dainiai'. 3aRibes 3ablack currants 3abreeding value 3aclones 3acrossing 3acultivars 3adisease resistance 3afruit quality 3afungi 3agenes 3agenotype 3ahome gardens 3ahorticultural crops 3ahybrids 3ainheritance (genetics) 3amites 3apests 3aprogeny 3aLithuania1 aMazeikiene, I.1 aBaniulis, D.1 aStanys, V.1 aSiksnianas, T.0 tActa horticulturae.g2013 Feb., , no. 976 p.523-527dInternational Society for Horticultural Sciencex0567-75727nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.actahort.org/books/976/976_74.htm3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02822naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003200111040001800143100002700161245009300188300001600281500002400297520120000321650001801521650001601539650001801555650001301573650002101586650002001607650001201627650001601639650001701655650001101672650001701683650001301700650002501713650002801738650003701766650001201803650003501815650002901850650002801879650002401907650001101931650001601942650004201958650002302000650002502023700002902048700002602077773011102103852000902214856004502223655001202268IND4409698420221121234149.0080830e200808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440969842DNAL7 a183832342pmid7 a10.1002/mnfr.2007000502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKarmiris, Konstantinos10aLeptin, adiponectin, resistin, and ghrelin - Implications for inflammatory bowel disease  ap. 855-866.  aIncludes references  aInflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is characterized by anorexia, malnutrition, altered body composition, and development of mesenteric white adipose tissue (WAT) hypertrophy. Increasing evidence suggests that adipokines synthesized either in WAT or in immune cells, are involved in these manifestations of IBD. Among adipokines leptin, adiponectin and resistin hold a fundamental role while the role of ghrelin in inflammation is not well established. Preliminary studies have shown overexpression of leptin, adiponectin, and resistin in mesenteric WAT of patients with Crohn's disease (CD) and significant alterations of circulating serum levels of these adipokines in IBD. It has also been demonstrated that intestinal inflammation causes an increase in endogenous ghrelin production. In animal models of intestinal inflammation, existing data suggest that leptin, adiponectin, and resistin are pivotal mediators of inflammation. Interesting therapeutic interventions based on these data have been suggested. A specific role for hypertrophic WAT has also been implicated in CD. Further efforts with experimental and clinical studies are needed to better understand the role of adipokines in IBD. 3aCrohn disease 3aadiponectin 3aanimal models 3aanorexia 3abody composition 3aclinical trials 3aghrelin 3ahypertrophy 3ainflammation 3aleptin 3amalnutrition 3aresistin 3awhite adipose tissue 2aAdiponectinxphysiology 2aAdipose Tissue, Whitexpathology 2aAnimals 2aColitis, Ulcerativexpathology 2aCrohn Diseasexpathology 2aCytokinesxbiosynthesis 2aGhrelinxphysiology 2aHumans 2aHypertrophy 2aInflammatory Bowel Diseasesxetiology 2aLeptinxphysiology 2aResistinxphysiology1 aKoutroubakis, Ioannis E.1 aKouroumalis, Elias A.0 tMolecular nutrition & food research.g2008 Aug., v. 52, no. 8 p.855-866dWiley-VCH Verlagx1613-41257nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/mnfr.200700050 7aarticle02707naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002400110245008800134300001600222500012700238500002400365520137100389650001901760650001901779650001101798650001301809650000901822650001501831650001401846650002001860650001201880650001001892650001401902650001701916650001601933650001101949650001701960651001401977700001601991700002202007700001502029773012202044852000902166856008602175655001202261IND4471886320221121234154.0130916s2013    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447188632DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGelvonauskienė, D.10aDiversity of resistance to Monilinia laxa and spring frost of sour cherry germplasm  ap. 537-542.  aPaper presented at the XIII Eucarpia Symposium on Fruit Breeding and Genetics, held September 11-15, 2011, Warsaw, Poland.  aIncludes references  aSour cherry (Prunus cerasus L.) is one of the most widely grown stone fruits in Lithuania. Blossom blight (Monilinia laxa (Aderhold et Ruhand) Honey) and spring frost are the major factors influencing yield of sour cherry. Sour cherry accessions from different origins were investigated in the genetic resources collection of the Institute of Horticulture, LRCAF during 2001-2011. It was established that blossom blight injured all investigated accessions of sour cherry, although cultivar resistance to blossom blight and dynamics of infection were different, for example the cultivars 'Vielein', '‘Vietine rugscioji', 'Griot maskovskyj' and No. 1974-79 are very resistant to blossom blight. Sour cherry flower buds at the first white stage are the most sensitive to spring frosts. Flowers and fruit ovaries of 'Note', 'Sirpotreb ciornaya', 'Biruliovskaya' and 'Maliga emplore' were the most resistant to frosts. A medium negative correlation exists between flower damage caused by frosts and resistance to blossom blight. These accessions can be introduced into the sour cherry breeding programme as donors of resistance to blossom blight, sources of resistance to frosts or as donors of both, as is the case for 'Rovesnica' which is tolerant to blossom blight and frosts, and consequently it can become an important cultivar for breeding and ecological farming. 3aMonilinia laxa 3aPrunus cerasus 3ablight 3abreeding 3abuds 3acrop yield 3acultivars 3afarming systems 3aflowers 3afrost 3agermplasm 3ahorticulture 3aplant ovary 3aspring 3astone fruits 3aLithuania1 aFrercks, B.1 aStepulaitiene, I.1 aStanys, V.0 tActa horticulturae.g2013 Feb., , no. 976 p.537-542dInternational Society for Horticultural Sciencex0567-75727nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.actahort.org/books/976/976_76.htm3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02384naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001900129245011400148300001600262300002100278500001500299520131400314650002601628650001301654650001801667650002201685650001701707650001401724650002001738650001601758650002001774650002001794653001501814700001301829700001501842773007401857852000901931939003301940946001301973655001201986IND9102256320221121223430.0910520e199103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND910225632DNAL7 a166680422pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChristie, P.J.10aLow-temperature accumulation of alcohol dehydrogenase-1 mRNA and protein activity in maize and rice seedlings  ap. 699-706.  ap. 699-706. ill.  a2019-12-05  aLow-temperature stress was shown to cause a rapid increase in steady-state levels of alcohol dehydrogenase-1 message (Adh1) and protein activity (ADH1) in maize (Zea mays) (B37N, A188) and rice (Oryza sativa) (Taipei 309, Calmochi 101) seedlings. Maize roots and rice shoots and roots from 7-day seedlings shifted to low temperature (100 degrees C) contained as much as 15-fold more Adh1 mRNA and 8-fold more ADH1 protein activity than the corresponding tissues from untreated seedlings. Time-course studies showed that these tissues accumulated Adh1 mRNA and ADH1 activity severalfold within 4- to 8-hour, levels plateaued within 20 to 24 hours, and remained elevated at 4 days of cold treatment. Within 24 hours of returning cold-stressed seedlings to ambient temperature, Adh1 mRNA and ADH1 activity decreased to pretreatment levels. Histochemical staining of maize and rice tissue imprints showed that ADH activity was enhanced along the lengths of cold-stressed maize primary roots and rice roots, and along the stems and leaves of rice shoots. Our observations suggest that short-term cold stress induces Adh1 gene expression in certain plant tissues, which, reminiscient of the anaerobic response, may reflect a fundamental shift in energy metabolism to ensure tissue survival during the stress period. 3aalcohol dehydrogenase 3aZea mays 3amessenger RNA 3aprotein synthesis 3aOryza sativa 3aseedlings 3astress response 3acold stress 3agene expression 3aenzyme activity 0ametabolism1 aHahn, M.1 aWalbot, V.0 tPlant physiology.g1991 Mar., v. 95, no. 3 p.699-706x0032-08897nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02988naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003800111040001800149100001900167245010400186300001800290500002400308520142600332650002601758650001301784650002201797650001301819650001701832650001401849650001001863650001601873650002601889650000901915650001301924650001401937650002001951650001401971650001201985650002701997650002702024650003302051650004402084650006302128700001902191700002302210700001902233700002102252773010002273852000902373856008802382655001202470IND4471877820221121223436.0130913s2013    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447187782DNAL7 a239058092pmid7 a10.4315/0362-028X.JFP-13-0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEbner, Rebecca10aMicroarray-Based Characterization of Staphylococcus aureus Isolates Obtained from Chicken Carcasses  ap. 1471-1474.  aIncludes references  aA total of 34 Staphylococcus aureus isolates from flock-wise pooled chicken neck skin samples collected at two abattoirs during slaughter were characterized with DNA microarray analysis and spa typing.

In addition, all isolates harbored genes for intracellular adhesion proteins (icaA/C/D) and were positive for cap5 or cap8 (capsule type 5 or 8). Comparison of DNA microarray profiles identified four categories comprising (i) all isolates of CC12, (ii) all isolates of CC5, (iii) the CC45 isolate, and (iv) the CC101 isolate. The high similarity of the isolates from abattoir A could indicate contamination of chicken carcasses with S. aureus persisting on the slaughter equipment, but further investigations are required to elucidate potential contamination routes. 3aStaphylococcus aureus 3aadhesion 3achicken carcasses 3achickens 3aenterotoxins 3aequipment 3agenes 3amethicillin 3amicroarray technology 3aneck 3aproteins 3aslaughter 3aslaughterhouses 2aAbattoirs 2aAnimals 2aChickensxmicrobiology 2aEnterotoxinsxgenetics 2aFood Contaminationxanalysis 2aOligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis 2aStaphylococcus aureusxgeneticsxisolation & purification.1 aJohler, Sophia1 aSihto, Henna-Maria1 aStephan, Roger1 aZweifel, Claudio0 tJournal of food protection.g2013 Aug., v. 76, no. 8 p.1471-1474wJournal:2024x0362-028X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.4315/0362-028X.JFP-13-0093Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03177naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100003200164245012800196300001800324520150700342650002801849650001201877650002901889650001601918650001701934650002001951650001701971650001801988650002902006650002402035650003902059650003702098650003102135650004002166653004302206653001102249653003002260653002002290700002902310700003402339700003602373773013602409852000902545856008502554930003302639946001102672655001202683IND4420961320221121223540.0090522e200906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442096132DNAL7 a192661882pmid7 a10.1007/s00216-009-2654-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSuárez Araujo, Carmen Paz.10aHUMANN-based system to identify benzimidazole fungicides using multi-synchronous fluorescence spectra: An ensemble approach  ap. 1059-1072.  aIn this paper, we approach, using neural computation and ensemble systems, a pattern classification problem in fluorescence spectrometry, the resolution of difficult multi-fungicide mixtures (overlapping), specifically the benzimidazole fungicides, benomyl, carbendazim, thiabendazole and fuberidazole. These fungicides are compounds of an important environmental interest. Because of this, from an analytical point of view, it is interesting to develop sensitive, selective and simple methods for their determination. Fluorescence spectrometry has proven to be a sensitive and selective technique for determination of many compounds of environmental interest, but in some cases it is not enough. HUMANN is a hierarchical, unsupervised, modular, adaptive neural net with high biological plausibility, which has shown to be suitable for identification of these fungicides and organochlorinated compounds of environmental interest. We propose two modular artificial intelligent systems, with a structure of pre-processing and processing stage, a multi-input HUMANN-based system, using multi-fluorescence spectra as input to the system, and a HUMANN-ensemble system. We analyze the optimal configuration of inputs and the ensemble in order to obtain better results. We study such figures as precision and sensitivity of the method. Our proposal is a smart, flexible and effective complementary method, which allows reducing the analytical and/or computational complexity of the analysis.

Nevertheless, the standard analytic frameworks in landscape genetics have difficulty evaluating hypotheses about spatial processes in dynamic landscapes. We use a predictive hypothesis-driven approach to quantify the relative contribution of historic and contemporary processes to genetic connectivity. By confronting genetic data with models of historic and contemporary landscapes, we identify dispersal processes operating in naturally heterogeneous and human-altered systems. We demonstrate the approach using a case study of microsatellite polymorphism and indirect estimates of gene flow for a rainforest bird, the logrunner (Orthonyx temminckii). Of particular interest was how much information in the genetic data was attributable to processes occurring in the reconstructed historic landscape and contemporary human-modified landscape. A linear mixed model was used to estimate appropriate sampling variance from nonindependent data and information-theoretic model selection provided strength of evidence for alternative hypotheses. The contemporary landscape explained slightly more information in the genetic differentiation data than the historic landscape, and there was considerable evidence for a temporal shift in dispersal pattern. In contrast, migration rates estimated from genealogical information were primarily influenced by contemporary landscape change. We discovered that landscape heterogeneity facilitated gene flow before European settlement, but contemporary deforestation is rapidly becoming the most important barrier to logrunner dispersal. 3abirds 3acase studies 3adeforestation 3agene flow 3ahabitats 3alandscapes 3amicrosatellite repeats 3arain forests 3astatistical models 3avariance 2aAnimals 2aEcosystem 2aGene Flow 2aGenetics, Population 2aGenotype 2aMicrosatellite Repeats 2aModels, Genetic 2aPasseriformesxgenetics 2aPolymorphism, Genetic 2aPopulation Dynamics 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 0aQueensland 0acoalescent theory 0aeffective dispersal 0ahabitat loss 0amicrosatellite DNA 0aOrthonyx temminckii1 aGoldizen, Anne W.1 aPrentis, Peter J.1 aNicholls, James A.1 aLowe, Andrew J.0 tMolecular ecology.g2009 July, v. 18, no. 14 p.2945-2960dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0962-10837nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-294X.2009.04226.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20120406b20120504c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02592naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001500110245008300125300001600208500012700224500002400351520113800375650001901513650001601532650001001548650001401558650002401572650001201596650001301608650001101621650001001632650001301642650001201655650001601667650001001683650001201693650001901705650001701724700001701741700001901758700001701777700001601794700001201810700001501822700001701837700001501854773012201869852000901991856008602000655001202086IND4471880020221121202055.0130913s2013    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447188002DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrandi, F.10aMolecular and biochemical studies on phytonutrient accumulation in peach fruit  ap. 389-395.  aPaper presented at the XIII Eucarpia Symposium on Fruit Breeding and Genetics, held September 11-15, 2011, Warsaw, Poland.  aIncludes references  aCarotenoids are plant metabolites which are not only essential in photosynthesis but also important quality factors in determining the pigmentation and aroma of flowers and fruits. The expression patterns of relevant carotenoid genes and metabolites were studied throughout fruit development, in order to investigate carotenoid metabolism and the relationships between ethylene emission and carotenoid production in peaches (Prunus persica L. Batsch.). Four cultivars with different flesh colour (yellow vs. white) and/or flesh type (melting vs. stony-hard) were analyzed throughout the fruit development cycle. 'Redhaven Bianca', the white-fleshed mutant of 'Redhaven', showed the highest levels of ccd1 expression at all stages of fruit development. The dioxygenase genes family, in peach as in other species, is directly involved in carotenoid degradation and the concomitant emission of volatile substances with a high odour impact. In both white-fleshed stony-hard genotypes, however, this gene was very poorly expressed in the fruit, suggesting that the stony-hard trait interacts with the metabolism/catabolism of carotenoids. 3aPrunus persica 3acarotenoids 3acolor 3acultivars 3aethylene production 3aflowers 3afruiting 3afruits 3agenes 3agenotype 3amelting 3ametabolites 3aodors 3apeaches 3aphotosynthesis 3apigmentation1 aLiverani, A.1 aGiovannini, D.1 aBuccheri, M.1 aBianchi, G.1 aPapa V.1 aGrassi, M.1 aMourgues, F.1 aRosati, C.0 tActa horticulturae.g2013 Feb., , no. 976 p.389-395dInternational Society for Horticultural Sciencex0567-75727nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.actahort.org/books/976/976_53.htm3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02744naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001500110245007800125300001600203500012700219500002400346520128700370650001701657650001101674650001301685650001901698650001701717650001001734650001801744650001001762650002401772650002601796650001601822650001901838650001401857650002801871650001401899650001001913650002201923650001001945700001401955700001601969700001501985700001702000700001602017773012202033852000902155856008602164655001202250IND4471879220221121170859.0130913s2013    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447187922DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVolz, R.K.10aGenetic relationships between red flesh and fruit quality traits in apple  ap. 363-368.  aPaper presented at the XIII Eucarpia Symposium on Fruit Breeding and Genetics, held September 11-15, 2011, Warsaw, Poland.  aIncludes references  aThe genetic relationships between 'Type 1' red flesh and several fruit quality traits in apple were assessed in breeding populations that segregated in the field for white and red flesh. Transgenic plants grown in the glasshouse and genetically modified with the MdMYB10 gene, responsible for the 'Type 1' red flesh phenotype, were also examined. Moderate positive genetic correlations were found in each of two seedling populations between the amount of red colour estimated in the cortical flesh of fruit (WCI) and astringent taste and an internal flesh browning disorder (IFBD) observed in fruit after medium-term cold storage. In one family, a quantitative trait locus for astringent taste and IFBD was mapped to the same position at the bottom of linkage group (LG) 9 as that for WCI and MdMYB10. Fruit from ‘Royal Gala’ trees that had been transformed with 35S-MdMYB10 had high flesh anthocyanin concentrations but also showed considerable IFBD after cold storage. In contrast, white flesh 'Royal Gala' control fruit did not show any cortical MdMYB10 expression or IFBD symptoms and had minimal flesh anthocyanin concentrations. These results are discussed with regards to future breeding strategies that aim to optimize fruit quality in 'Type 1' red flesh breeding lines. 3aanthocyanins 3aapples 3abreeding 3abreeding lines 3acold storage 3acolor 3afruit quality 3agenes 3agenetic correlation 3agenetic relationships 3agreenhouses 3alinkage groups 3aphenotype 3aquantitative trait loci 3aseedlings 3ataste 3atransgenic plants 3atrees1 aKumar, S.1 aChagné, D.1 aEspley, R.1 aMcGhie, T.K.1 aAllan, A.C.0 tActa horticulturae.g2013 Feb., , no. 976 p.363-368dInternational Society for Horticultural Sciencex0567-75727nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.actahort.org/books/976/976_49.htm3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03658naa a2200721 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100001300171245011000184300001800294520128700312650002101599650001501620650002601635650002901661650002101690650001401711650001801725650003001743650001901773650001301792650001801805650001801823650002101841650002301862650001101885650002401896650002001920650001001940650002501950650002501975650001202000650006302012650003602075650002102111650003502132650005402167650004202221650003402263650003102297650003102328650003502359650005402394650005602448650001002504653002702514653002002541653003702561700001302598700001402611700001102625700001202636773013102648852000902779856009202788930003302880946001102913655001202924IND4428611120221121170936.0091113e200912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442861112DNAL7 a196457692pmid7 a10.1111/j.1365-2672.2009.04374.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Q.10aIn vitro evaluation of the activity of microencapsulated carvacrol against Escherichia coli with K88 pili  ap. 1781-1788.  aThe aim of the current study is to develop encapsulation of essential oils for oral delivery to the small intestine of pigs in order to retain their antimicrobial activity. Carvacrol was used as a model essential oil and successfully encapsulated in microcapsules made from Ca-alginate hydrogel using an emulsion-extrusion technology with high encapsulation efficiency. This encapsulation method did not compromise the antimicrobial activity when tested against Escherichia coli K88 in a culture medium, as well as in a simulated gastrointestinal model. In the simulated gastrointestinal model, <20% of encapsulated carvacrol was released in the simulated gastric fluid; the rest was nearly completely released in the intestinal fluid after 6 h of incubation. Encapsulation in Ca-alginate microcapsules could effectively reduce the early absorption of carvacrol in the upper gastrointestinal tract after oral administration, therefore, retains its potential antibacterial activity for the small intestine. The developed encapsulation method is expected to be suitable for encapsulation of other essential oils.

These characters are mainly evaluated in the last steps of the breeding work where a reduced number of genotypes with high number of replications are evaluated. In this work, fruit and oil characteristics of eight advanced selections of a breeding program in Córdoba, Spain, together with ‘Arbequina’ and ‘Picual’ cultivars as controls were studied. Significant differences between genotypes were observed for all the characters under study. Variation of fruit and oil characters was evaluated once a month from September to December. This allows the comparison of ranking of genotypes throughout the ripening period considering different dates or ripening index of samples. Also the optimal harvesting date for each genotype based on patterns for oil accumulation, oil quality characters and ease of fruit detachment, was determined. Future work is planned to evaluate the adaptation of the most promising selection to different environments. 3abreeding 3acultivars 3agenotype 3aharvest date 3alipid content 3amechanical harvesting 3aolive oil 3aolives 3aripening 3aSpain1 aTalhaoui, N.1 aLeón, L.1 aRosa, R. de la1 aVelasco, L.1 aPérez-Vich, B.0 tActa horticulturae.g2013 Feb., , no. 976 p.415-419dInternational Society for Horticultural Sciencex0567-75727nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.actahort.org/books/976/976_57.htm3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03889naa a2200685 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100001900171245018100190300001800371520159000389650001801979650002701997650001802024650002202042650001302064650002202077650002102099650000902120650001302129650002202142650001702164650000902181650002402190650001802214650002302232650002702255650003702282650003902319650003302358650004202391650003802433650004202471650002202513650002802535650004402563650002502607650004902632653002602681653002802707653003102735700001902766700002202785700002402807700002002831700001802851700002102869700002102890700002102911773011402932852000903046856009203055930003303147946001103180655001203191IND4424253520221121132656.0090807e200909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442425352DNAL7 a197080872pmid7 a10.1111/j.1742-4658.2009.07184.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShibata, Naoki10aStructure analysis of the flavoredoxin from Desulfovibrio vulgaris Miyazaki F reveals key residues that discriminate the functions and properties of the flavin reductase family  ap. 4840-4853.  aThe crystal structure of flavoredoxin from Desulfovibrio vulgaris Miyazaki F was determined at 1.05 Å resolution and its ferric reductase activity was examined. The aim was to elucidate whether flavoredoxin has structural similarity to ferric reductase and ferric reductase activity, based on the sequence similarity to ferric reductase from Archaeoglobus fulgidus. As expected, flavoredoxin shared a common overall structure with A. fulgidus ferric reductase and displayed weak ferric reductase and flavin reductase activities; however, flavoredoxin contains two FMN molecules per dimer, unlike A. fulgidus ferric reductase, which has only one FMN molecule per dimer. Compared with A. fulgidus ferric reductase, flavoredoxin forms three additional hydrogen bonds and has a significantly smaller solvent-accessible surface area. These observations explain the higher affinity of flavoredoxin for FMN. Unexpectedly, an electron-density map indicated the presence of a Mes molecule on the re-side of the isoalloxazine ring of FMN, and that two zinc ions are bound to the two cysteine residues, Cys39 and Cys40, adjacent to FMN. These two cysteine residues are close to one of the putative ferric ion binding sites of ferric reductase. Based on their structural similarities, we conclude that the corresponding site of ferric reductase is the most plausible site for ferric ion binding. Comparing the structures with related flavin proteins revealed key structural features regarding the discrimination of function (ferric ion or flavin reduction) and a unique electron transport system. 3aArchaeoglobus 3aDesulfovibrio vulgaris 3abinding sites 3acrystal structure 3acysteine 3aelectron transfer 3ahydrogen bonding 3aions 3aproteins 3asequence homology 3asurface area 3azinc 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aBinding Sites 2aCloning, Molecular 2aCrystallography, X-Ray 2aCysteinexchemistryxmetabolism. 2aDesulfovibrio vulgarisxmetabolism 2aEscherichia colixmetabolism 2aFMN Reductasexchemistryxmetabolism. 2aFlavin Mononucleotidexmetabolism 2aFlavoproteinsxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aModels, Molecular 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aOxidoreductasesxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aProtein Conformation 2aRecombinant Proteinsxchemistryxmetabolism. 0aflavin mononucleotide 0aflavin reductase family 0asulfate-reducing bacterium1 aUeda, Yasufumi1 aTakeuchi, Daisuke1 aHaruyama, Yoshihiro1 aKojima, Shuichi1 aSato, Junichi1 aNiimura, Youichi1 aKitamura, Masaya1 aHiguchi, Yoshiki0 tFEBS journal.g2009 Sept., v. 276, no. 17 p.4840-4853dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx1742-464X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1742-4658.2009.07184.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20090808b20091002c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03466naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002500092040001800117100001500135245009800150300001600248520201200264650001202276650001502288650001302303650001902316650001302335650001702348650001902365650000902384650002202393650001102415650000702426650001502433650001402448650001102462650001802473650002602491650001902517651001002536653001902546653000802565653002502573653001902598653002102617700001502638700001602653700002002669773010702689852000902796856007502805930003302880946001102913655001202924IND4424797520221121061249.0090821s2009    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442479752DNAL7 a10.1071/SR081812doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Yong10aPhosphate adsorption at variable charge soil/water interfaces as influenced by ionic strength  ap. 529-536.  aThe effect of phosphate adsorption on zeta potential of the colloids of variable charge soils and the effect of ionic strength on phosphate adsorption by the soils were investigated using batch experimental method. The presence of phosphate resulted in the decrease in zeta potential and isoelectric point (IEP) of the colloids of the soils, which further suggested that the phosphate was adsorbed specifically by these soils. The effect of phosphate adsorption on zeta potential was correlated with the content of free Fe/Al oxides in the soils; the higher the content of Fe/Al oxides in a soil the greater was the decrease in zeta potential and IEP of the soil colloids. The intersection of phosphate adsorption-pH curves at different ionic strengths (a characteristic pH) was obtained for 2 Oxisols. Above this pH, the adsorption of phosphate increased with increasing ionic strength, whereas below it the reverse trend occurred. The intersect pH was 4.60 for the Oxisol from Guangdong and 4.55 for the Oxisol from Yunnan, which was lower than the values of PZSE (point of zero salt effect) of these soils, but near the PZNC (point of zero net charge) of the soils. The effects of ionic strength and pH on phosphate adsorption by these soils were interpreted with the help of an adsorption model developed previously by Bowden et al. The results of zeta potential suggested that the potential in an adsorption plane became less negative with increasing ionic strength above the soil PZNC and decreased with increasing ionic strength below the soil PZNC. These results support the hypothesis of the adsorption model that the potential in the adsorption plane changed with ionic strength with an opposite trend to the surface charge of these soils. The phosphate adsorption by these soils was related not only to the ionic strength but also to the types of electrolytes present. K⁺ induced a greater increase in phosphate adsorption than Na⁺ due to the greater affinity of the soils to K⁺ than Na⁺. 3aOxisols 3aadsorption 3aaluminum 3aaluminum oxide 3acolloids 3aelectrolytes 3aionic strength 3airon 3aisoelectric point 3amodels 3apH 3aphosphates 3apotassium 3asodium 3asoil colloids 3avariable charge soils 3azeta potential 3aChina 0azeta potential 0aIEP 0adiffuse double layer 0asurface charge 0aadsorption model1 aJiang, Jun1 aXu, Ren-kou1 aTiwari, Diwakar0 tSoil research.g2009, v. 47, no. 5 p.529-536dCollingwood, Victoria: CSIRO Publishingx0004-95737nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1071/SR081813Available from publisher's Web site  a20090821b00000000c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02749naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003200092040001800124100002200142245009800164300001800262500002400280520142600304650001201730650001901742650001401761650001201775650001601787650001701803650001001820650004301830650001701873650001301890650001301903650001901916650001401935650001101949650001101960650001101971700001901982700005402001700002402055700003002079773012802109852000902237856004502246655001202291IND4414248420221121061444.0081226e200812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441424842DNAL7 a10.1002/ejlt.2008000702doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGarcía, Aranzazu10aEnrichment of pomace olive oil in triterpenic acids during storage of "Alpeorujo" olive paste  ap. 1136-1141.  aIncludes references  aTriterpenic acids are natural compounds present in plants and foods with beneficial properties for human health and thus they are desirable in the food, cosmetics and pharmaceutical industries. Pomace olive is considered a good source of these substances. In this study, oleanolic and maslinic acids were found to be the main triterpenic acids identified in pomace olive oil obtained from stored "Alpeorujo". Determination of the two acids was achieved by a new procedure that consists of extracting the acids from the oil with a mixture of methanol/ethanol, and then separating and quantifying them by HPLC. Results showed that their concentration increased up to 16 g/kg of oil during storage of the pomace in large ponds for 7 months. The concentration of both triterpenic acids was similar in the pomace olive oil obtained by using the centrifugation system. By contrast, a much lower concentration of maslinic than oleanolic acid was detected in pomace olive oils obtained by solvent extraction from the previously centrifugated "Alpeorujo" paste. These triterpenic acids also contributed to the acidity of the crude oil. Likewise, the oil of the pomace paste was enriched in other substances such as 4-ethylphenol and aliphatic alcohols during the storage of the paste in large ponds. Consequently, crude pomace olive oil can be considered a good source of triterpenic acids when obtained from a stored olive paste. 3aacidity 3acentrifugation 3acosmetics 3aethanol 3afood plants 3afood quality 3afoods 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3ahuman health 3aindustry 3amethanol 3aoleanolic acid 3aolive oil 3aolives 3apastes 3apomace1 aBrenes, Manuel1 aDobarganes, M[ordinal indicator, feminine] Carmen1 aRomero, Concepción1 aRuiz-Méndez, Ma Victoria0 tEuropean journal of lipid science and technology.g2008 Dec., v. 110, no. 12 p.1136-1141dWiley-VCH Verlagx1438-76977nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ejlt.200800070 7aarticle02535naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002000110245011800130300001800248500002800266520143400294650002801728650001901756650004301775650001801818650001501836650002201851650004401873650001501917700002601932700002201958700002001980700002302000773014002023852000902163946001302172655001202185IND4405485820221121045503.0080509s2008    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440548582DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBunescu, Andrei10aComparison of Microbial and Photochemical Processes and Their Combination for Degradation of 2-Aminobenzothiazole  ap. 2976-2984.  aPublisher supplied data  aThe transformation of 2-aminobenzothiazole (ABT) was studied under various conditions: (i) a photodegradation process at a λ of >300 nm in the presence of an Fe(III)-nitrilotriacetic acid complex (FeNTA), (ii) a biodegradation process using Rhodococcus rhodochrous OBT18 cells, and (iii) the combined processes (FeNTA plus Rhodococcus rhodochrous in the presence or absence of light). The transformation of ABT in the combined system, with or without light, was much more efficient (99% degradation after 25 h) than in the separated systems (37% photodegradation and 26% biodegradation after 125 h). No direct photolysis of ABT was observed. The main result seen is the strong positive impact of FeNTA on the photodegradation, as expected, and on the biotransformation efficiency of ABT, which was more surprising. This positive impact of FeNTA on the microbial metabolism was dependent on the FeNTA concentration. The use of UV high-performance liquid chromatography, liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization mass spectrometry, and in situ ¹H nuclear magnetic resonance provided evidence of the intermediary products and thus established transformation pathways of ABT in the different processes. These pathways were identical whether the degradation process was photo- or biotransformation. A new photoproduct was identified (4OH-ABT), corresponding to a hydroxylation reaction on position 4 of the aromatic ring of ABT. 3aRhodococcus rhodochrous 3abiodegradation 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3ahydroxylation 3aionization 3amass spectrometry 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aphotolysis1 aBesse-Hoggan, Pascale1 aSancelme, Martine1 aMailhot, Gilles1 aDelort, Anne-Marie0 tApplied and environmental microbiology AEM.g2008 May 15, v. 74, no. 10 p.2976-2984dAmerican Society for Microbiologyx0099-22407nnas  aDNAL  aOther US 7aarticle02014naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001600164245012600180300001800306500002400324520063500348650002400983650002301007650001801030650002301048650001201071650002201083650003301105650002501138650002901163650004101192650002401233650002701257650002701284650002601311700001601337700001601353700001301369773010401382852000901486856008501495655001201580IND4424341820221121045447.0090808s2009    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442434182DNAL7 a194589232pmid7 a10.1007/s10529-009-0012-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXiao, Zijun10aFormation and identification of trimethylimidazole during tetramethylpyrazine production from glucose by Bacillus strains  ap. 1421-1425.  aIncludes references  aDuring 2,3,5,6-tetramethylpyrazine production from glucose by Bacillus strains, a novel product was detected and identified as 2,4,5-trimethylimidazole (TMI) by GC/MS.

Six plots of 50 m² each were planted with two types of plant species (Zea mays spp. and Medicago lupulina spp.) and irrigated using three types of water (fresh groundwater, mine wastewater, and hydride water consisting of 50% fresh and 50% mine wastewater) to investigate the suitability of utilizing mine wastewater for food production in the area. Water, soil and plant sampling was completed for each plot over different time intervals and analyzed for heavy metal (Cr⁺⁶, Ni⁺², Zn⁺² and Pb⁺²) in addition to major ionic composition of the water used for irrigation. Crop yield was estimated at the end of the experiment. Plots irrigated with mine wastewater showed slightly higher heavy metals concentrations and soil salinity during the experiment period was higher for plots irrigated with mine wastewater compared to plots irrigated with fresh water, and it was uniform through the upper 45 cm of the soil profile due to the high amount of irrigation water used during the experiment. Crop yield was inversely proportional to salinity as an increase of salinity by 2-folds resulted in reducing yield by almost 50%. However, no risk of heavy metals contamination was found in plants and soil. 3aMedicago lupulina 3aZea mays 3achromium 3acrop yield 3afood production 3afreshwater 3agroundwater 3aheavy metals 3ahydrides 3airrigation rates 3airrigation water 3alead 3amining 3aphosphates 3aplanting 3arisk 3asalinity 3asoil profiles 3asoil salinity 3awastewater 3awater quality 3awater reuse 3azinc 3aJordan 0aPhosphate-mining wastewater 0aPlant1 aJiries, Anwar 1 aZubi, Yasin 1 aNāqah, ʻAlī.0 tEnvironment, development and sustainability.g2009 Aug., v. 11, no. 4 p.695-703dDordrecht : Springer Netherlandsx1387-585X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10668-007-9137-93Available from publisher's Web site  a20090626b20090703c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle04311naa a2200685 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002100111024002700132040001800159100001500177245016100192300001800353500002400371500001500395506007600410520181500486506003702301650001402338650001302352650001802365650001102383650002502394650002602419650001402445650003602459650002002495650001902515650003802534650002902572650007702601650005802678650005202736650002902788650003102817650007502848650002402923650002102947650003902968650003703007650005603044650002603100650001603126650002403142650003603166653001003202700001603212700001403228700001903242773015303261852000903414856007703423856005403500930003303554945001303587946001303600655001203613IND2328216820221207114405.0020724e200203  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232821682DNAL7 a118912692pmid7 aPMC1522262pmcid7 a10.1104/pp.0106122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBasset, G.10aChanges in the expression and the enzymic properties of the 20S proteasome in sugar-starved maize roots.

After biochemical characterization, it was shown to be similar to most eukaryotic proteasomes. We investigated the involvement of the 20S proteasome in the response to carbon starvation in excised maize root tips. Using polyclonal antibodies, we showed that the amount of proteasome increased in 24-h-carbon-starved root tips compared with freshly excised tips, whereas the mRNA levels of alpha3 and beta6 subunits of 20S proteasome decreased. Moreover, in carbon-starved tissues, chymotrypsin-like and caseinolytic activities of the 20S proteasome were found to increase, whereas trypsin-like activities decreased. The measurement of specific activities and kinetic parameters of 20S proteasome purified from 24-h-starved root tips suggested that it was subjected to posttranslational modifications. Using dinitrophenylhydrazine, a carbonyl-specific reagent, we observed an increase in carbonyl residues in 20S proteasome purified from starved root tips. This means that 20S proteasome was oxidized during starvation treatment. Moreover, an in vitro mild oxidative treatment of 20S proteasome from non-starved material resulted in the activation of chymotrypsin-like, peptidyl-glutamyl-peptide hydrolase and caseinolytic-specific activities and in the inhibition of trypsin-like specific activities, similar to that observed for proteasome from starved root tips. Our results provide the first evidence, to our knowledge, for an in vivo carbonylation of the 20S proteasome. They suggest that sugar deprivation induces an oxidative stress, and that oxidized 20S proteasome could be associated to the degradation of oxidatively damaged proteins in carbon starvation situations.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aroot tips 3aZea mays 3amessenger RNA 3asugars 3aimmunohistochemistry 3anutrient deficiencies 3aoxidation 3achemical constituents of plants 3aenzyme activity 3aplant proteins 2aCarbonxdeficiencyxpharmacology. 2aChymotrypsinxmetabolism 2aCysteine Endopeptidasesxgeneticsxisolation & purificationxmetabolism. 2aGene Expression Regulation, Enzymologicxdrug effects 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plantxdrug effects 2aHydrazinesxpharmacology 2aHydrogen-Ion Concentration 2aMultienzyme Complexesxgeneticsxisolation & purificationxmetabolism. 2aOxidation-Reduction 2aOxidative Stress 2aPlant Rootsxenzymologyxgenetics. 2aProteasome Endopeptidase Complex 2aRNA, Messengerxdrug effectsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aSubstrate Specificity 2aTemperature 2aTrypsinxmetabolism 2aZea maysxenzymologyxgenetics. 0aroots1 aRaymond, P.1 aMalek, L.1 aBrouquisse, R.0 tPlant physiology.g2002 Mar., v. 128, no. 3 p.1149-1162dAmerican Society of Plant PhysiologistsaPlant physiology (Lancaster, Pa.)x0032-08897nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1104/pp.0106123Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://www.plantphysiol.org/3electronic resource  a20050129b20050130c00000000  aINDdCTR  aOther US 7aarticle03403naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100002000129245010400149300001800253300002300271500001500294520223700309650002502546650001902571650000802590650002602598650002002624650002002644650001902664650002102683653001502704653002302719653001102742700001802753700001402771700001602785700001702801700002002818773007602838852000902914939003302923946001302956655001202969IND9100597320221121015533.0910205e199011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND910059732DNAL7 a166678342pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHutchison, K.W.10aMaturation in larch.

Effects of age on photosynthesis and gene expression in developing foliage  ap. 1308-1315.  ap. 1308-1315. ill.  a2019-12-05  aThe effect of maturation on the morphological and photosynthetic characteristics, as well as the expression of two genes involved in photosynthesis in the developing, current year foliage of Eastern larch (Larix laricina [Du Roil]) is described. These effects were observed on foliage during the third growing season after grafting of scions from trees of different ages onto 2 year old rootstock. Specific leaf weight (gram dry weight per square meter), leaf cross-sectional area (per square millimeter), and chlorophyll content (milligram per gram dry weight) all increase with increasing age in long shoot foliage from both indoor- and outdoor-grown trees. Net photosynthesis (NPS) (mole of CO2 per square millimeter per second) increases with age on indoor- but not outdoor-grown trees. NPS also increases with increased chlorophyll content, but outdoor-grown scions of all ages had higher chlorophyll content, and chlorophyll does not appear to be limiting for NPS outdoors. To extend these studies of maturation-related differences in foliar morphology and physiology to the molecular genetic level, sequences were cloned from the cab and rbcS gene families of larch. Both cab and rbcS gene families are expressed in foliage but not in roots, and they are expressed in light-grown seedlings of larch but only at very low levels in dark-grown seedlings (approximately about 2% of light-grown seedlings). Steady-state cab mRNA levels are relatively higher (approximately 40%) in newly expanding short shoot foliage from juvenile plants compared to mature plants. Unlike cab, the expression of the rbcS gene family did not seem to vary with age. These data show that the maturation-related changes in morphological and physiological phenotypes are associated with changes in gene expression. No causal relationship has been established, however. Indeed, we conclude that the faster growth of juvenile scions reported previously (MS Greenwood, CA Hopper, KW Hutchison [1989] Plant Physiol 90: 406-412) is not due to increased NPS or cab expression. Long shoot foliage is the dominant foliar type on young trees and its lower specific leaf weight will permit production of more photosynthetic surface area per unit of leaf biomass. 3adevelopmental stages 3aLarix laricina 3aage 3anet assimilation rate 3aconifer needles 3agene expression 3aphotosynthesis 3aplant morphology 0amaturation 0agenetic regulation 0aleaves1 aSherman, C.D.1 aWeber, J.1 aSmith, S.S.1 aSinger, P.B.1 aGreenwood, M.S.0 tPlant physiology.g1990 Nov., v. 94, no. 3 p.1308-1315x0032-08897nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle01670naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001600129245012100145300001800266300002300284500001500307520060000322650002500922650001500947650001000962650002300972650003100995650002501026650001701051650002001068650001501088653001701103700001501120700001801135773007601153852000901229939003301238946001301271655001201284IND9100598320221121015334.0910205e199011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND910059832DNAL7 a166678442pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSmith, V.A.10aPartial purification and characterization of the gibberellin A20 3 beta-hydroxylase from seeds of Phaseolus vulgaris  ap. 1390-1401.  ap. 1390-1401. ill.  a2019-12-05  aThe GA20 3-beta-hydroxylase present in immature seeds of Phaseolus vulgaris has been partially purified and characterized.

The culture was allowed to reach a constant cell density under conditions in which the amount of toluene supplied equals the maintenance energy demand of the culture. Compared with toluene only, the presence of TCE at a toluene/TCE ratio of 2.3 caused a fourfold increase in the specific maintenance requirement for toluene from 22 to 94 nmol mg of cells (dry weight)-1 h-1. During a period of 3 weeks, approximately 65% of the incoming TCE was stably converted to unidentified products from which all three chlorine atoms were liberated. When toluene was subsequently omitted from the culture feed while TCE addition continued, mutants which were no longer able to grow on toluene or to degrade TCE appeared. These mutants were also unable to grow on phenol or m- or o-cresol but were still able to grow on catechol and benzoate. Plasmid analysis showed that the mutants had lost the plasmid involved in toluene monooxygenase formation (pTOM). Thus, although strain G4 is much less sensitive to TCE toxicity than methanotrophs, deleterious effects may still occur, namely, an increased maintenance energy demand in the presence of toluene and plasmid loss when no toluene is added. 3aPseudomonadaceae 3aBurkholderia cepacia 3abiodegradation 3ametabolism 3atoluene 3atrichloroethylene 3abioreactors 3acell culture 3amineralization1 aHouwing, J.1 aDolfing, J.1 aJanssen, D.B.0 tApplied and environmental microbiology.g1996 Mar., v. 62, no. 3 p.886-891x0099-22407nnas  aDNAL  a19960605b19960611c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle02369naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004000092040001800132100001600150245019900166300001800365500002400383520086400407650002201271650001001293650001601303650002301319650003001342650001401372650001601386650001701402650001401419650002201433650001601455650002101471650001001492650001401502650001101516650002901527650001301556650001901569650001501588650001201603700001801615700001701633700001401650700001501664700001401679773009601693852000901789856005301798655001201851IND4403014120221120231307.0080319e200805  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440301412DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2007.05.0522doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Qijun10aCo-producing lipopeptides and poly-γ-glutamic acid by solid-state fermentation of Bacillus subtilis using soybean and sweet potato residues and its biocontrol and fertilizer synergistic effects  ap. 3318-3323.  aIncludes references  aA Bacillus subtilis strain B6-1, previously isolated from the rhizosphere of vegetable, selectively produced antibiotics or poly-gamma-glutamic acid (γ-PGA) in two kinds of liquid media and their co-productions were obtained when using soybean and sweet potato residues in solid-state fermentation.

The introduction also significantly increased the dry weights of roots and shoots of cucumber seedlings, and the roots to shoots ratio, especially at lower nutrition, which indicated the fertilizer synergistic effects.

Clearly, the shift towards positive energy balance reflects both alterations in energy intake and decreases in physical activity. Increased energy intake and, in particular, the rising proportion of energy from fat is linked with obesity. However, on a population level reduced levels of activity probably play the predominant role. It is apparent that individual susceptibility to weight gain varies enormously. The factors underlying this susceptibility are an area of intense research interest. Variations in BMR from that predicted appear to be linked to the propensity to gain weight. The genes responsible for this variation may include uncoupling proteins-2 and -3, with a number of studies showing a link with obesity. However, in vivo studies of these proteins have not yet demonstrated a physiological role for them that would explain the link with obesity. Non-exercise activity thermogenesis may also protect from weight gain, but the regulation of this type of thermogenesis is unclear, although the sympathetic nervous system may be important. A profusion of hormones, cytokines and neurotransmitters is involved in regulating energy intake, but whilst mutations in leptin and the melanocortin-3 receptor are responsible for rare monogenic forms of obesity, their wider role in common polygenic obesity is not known. Much current work is directed at examining the interplay between genetic background and environmental factors, in particular diet, that both lead to positive energy balance and seem to make it so hard for many obese subjects to lose weight. 3acytokines 3adiet 3aenergy intake 3aenvironmental factors 3agenes 3agenetic background 3aheat production 3ain vivo studies 3aleptin 3amutation 3aneurotransmitters 3aobesity 3aphysical activity 3aproteins 3asympathetic nervous system 3aweight gain 2aBasal Metabolismxphysiology 2aCarrier Proteinsxphysiology 2aEnergy Intakexphysiology 2aEnergy Metabolism 2aExercisexphysiology 2aFood Deprivationxphysiology 2aGenetic Predisposition to Disease 2aHumans 2aIon Channels 2aMembrane Proteinsxphysiology 2aMitochondrial Proteins 2aObesityxdiet therapyxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aUncoupling Agentsxmetabolism0 tProceedings of the Nutrition Society.g2003 May, v. 62, no. 2 p.539-543dCABI Pub. on behalf of the Nutrition Societyx0029-66517nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1079/PNS20032563Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle01992naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001600129245017700145300001800322300002300340520093500363650001801298650001101316650001501327650001801342650001701360650001701377650002001394650002901414653002301443700001501466700001801481773007601499852000901575939003301584946001301617655001201630IND9100599820221120224433.0910205e199011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND910059982DNAL7 a166678592pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKoizuka, N.10aIsolation of a cDNA clone for alpha-amylase in mung bean cotyledons. Analysis of alpha-amylase mRNA levels in cotyledons during and following germination of mung bean seeds  ap. 1488-1491.  ap. 1488-1491. ill.  aA cDNA was isolated that codes for alpha-amylase in mung bean (Vigna radiata) cotyledons, and the nucleotide sequence was determined. The deduced amino acid sequence (421 amino acid residues) is about 65% homologous with those of barley alpha-amylases. By comparing the deduced sequence with the sequence of the purified alpha-amylase, it was inferred that 23 N-terminal amino acids of a nascent polypeptide represent a signal peptide. Northern blot analysis showed that the levels of alpha-amylase mRNA are in parallel with the activities of alpha-amylase synthesis in cotyledons. Under the conditions where the solute leakage from cotyledons is accelerated during inhibition, a rapid increase in the amount of the alpha-amylase mRNA occurs. We postulate that a factor(s) which regulates in an inhibitory manner the alpha-amylase expression at the transcriptional level may be present in dry cotyledons and be removed by leakage. 3aVigna radiata 3aclones 3acotyledons 3aalpha-amylase 3abiosynthesis 3agenetic code 3agene expression 3atranscription (genetics) 0agenetic regulation1 aTanaka, Y.1 aMorohashi, Y.0 tPlant physiology.g1990 Nov., v. 94, no. 3 p.1488-1491x0032-08897nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02378naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001600129245012300145300001800268300002300286520128800309650002601597650001701623650002501640650002701665650002001692650002601712650002201738650001201760653001701772700002101789700001601810700001801826700001701844773007601861852000901937939003301946946001301979655001201992IND9100598020221120211714.0910205e199011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND910059802DNAL7 a166678412pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJones, W.T.10aProduction and characterization of monoclonal antibodies against aspartate aminotransferase-P2 from lupin root nodules  ap. 1358-1364.  ap. 1358-1364. ill.  aTwenty-one monoclonal antibodies were raised against the aspartate aminotransferase-P2 isoenzyme from root nodules of Lupinus angustifolius [L.] cv Uniharvest. Induction of this isoenzyme is positively correlated with the onset of N2 fixation in effective root nodules and is associated with the assimilation of ammonia by the plant in the Rhizobium-legume symbiosis. The monoclonal antibodies produced were all of the IgG class, recognized five different epitopes on the protein, and represented greater than 90% of the available epitopes. These epitopes were not unique to lupin nodule aspartate aminotransferase-P2 but were shown to be present on the enzyme from tobacco leaves and potato. Four of the epitopes were conformational with a fifth epitope recognized by the appropriate monoclonals in both its native and denatured forms. None of the monoclonal antibodies produced reacted with Rhizobium lupini NZP2257 extracts. Antibodies against two epitopes showed some cross-reaction with the constitutive aspartate aminotransferase-P1 isoenzyme also found in lupin root nodules. However, affinity of these monoclonals for AAT-P1 was three orders of magnitude lower than for AAT-P2.

The extracts of 12 endophytes exhibited inhibitory effects on collagen-induced platelet aggregation with IC₅₀ values of 19.85-87.64 μg/ml. Four strains, Rahnella aquatilis, Pantoea agglomerans, Rhodotorula sp., and Penicillium paxilli, also showed inhibitory effects on thrombin-induced platelet aggregation with IC₅₀ values of 42.80-61.54 μg/ml. Additionally 12 extracts of endophytes exhibited cytotoxicities with IC₅₀ values of 0.12-19.83 μg/ml. However, eight extracts revealed inhibitory effects on superoxide anion generation induced by fMLP (N-formyl-l-methionyl-l-leucyl-l-phenylalanine) in human neutrophils. The extract of Rahnella aquatilis showed anti-platelet aggregation activity, and bioassay-directed fractionation led to the isolation of six compounds, including one isoalloxazine: lumichrome (1); two isoflavones: genistein (2) and daidzein (3); two cyclic peptides: cyclo-Pro-Val (4) and cyclo-Pro-Phe (5); and one benzenoid: methyl 2,4,5-trimethoxybenzoate (6). These results indicated that endophytes from Taiwanese herbal plants could be useful sources for research and development of bioactive lead compounds from nature. 3aPantoea agglomerans 3aPenicillium 3aRahnella aquatilis 3aRhodotorula 3aanti-inflammatory activity 3acyclic peptides 3acytotoxicity 3aendophytes 3agenistein 3ainhibitory concentration 50 3aneutrophils 3aplatelet aggregation 3aresearch and development 3asuperoxide anion1 aHsu, Li-Chi1 aLai, Chern-Hsiung1 aWu, Chin-Chung1 aHwang, Tsong-Long1 aLin, Yin-Ku1 aWu, Yang-Chang0 tWorld journal of microbiology & biotechnology.g2009 Aug., v. 25, no. 8 p.1461-1469dSpringer Netherlandsx0959-39937nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11274-009-0036-03Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02327naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002800111040001800139100002100157245006000178300001600238500002400254520117800278650001301456650000901469650001201478650002401490650002801514650002101542650001101563650001301574650001501587650003601602650001301638650001401651651001901665651001801684773014001702852000901842856007801851655001201929IND4472426920221120211538.0130920s2003    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447242692DNAL7 a146925912pmid7 a10.1079/PNS20032702doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aButtriss, Judith10aScene setting: who is the voice of nutrition in Britain  ap. 573-575.  aIncludes references  aCurrently the public is being inundated daily with information about diet and health, which is often conflicting and frequently not based on good quality evidence.

This situation, coupled with concern about the growing trend whereby detailed nutrition advice is sold to the public by self-styled 'experts' with no formal degree-level training in the subject, prompted a conference that highlighted the importance of ensuring that nutrition advice is evidence-based, using a series of topical overviews. In recent years the Nutrition Society has played an active role in establishing mechanisms to assist the public in their search for high-quality dietary advice by badging individuals appropriately qualified to offer sound and relevant advice on nutrition. 3aInternet 3adiet 3aexperts 3ahealth care workers 2aEvidence-Based Medicine 2aHealth Promotion 2aHumans 2aInternet 2aMass Media 2aNutritional Sciencesxeducation 2aResearch 2aSocieties 3aUnited Kingdom 0aGreat Britain0 tProceedings of the Nutrition Society.g2003 Aug., v. 62, no. 3 p.573-575dCABI Pub. on behalf of the Nutrition Societyx0029-66517nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1079/PNS20032703Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02336naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001500129245009600144300001800240300002300258520129900281650001701580650002501597650002101622650002001643650003101663650002201694650001301716653001601729700001501745700001601760700001501776700001501791700001301806773007601819852000901895939003301904946001301937655001201950IND9100599220221120211655.0910205e199011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND910059922DNAL7 a166678532pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChan, H.Y.10aSucrose synthase in rice plants.

On a dry matter basis, the amount of soluble protein and SS activity decreased significantly, but the amount of enzyme protein changed little in growing leaves. In the grain, the SS activity was the highest at the early ripening stage and decreased later, but the amount of SS protein increased with the increase in maturity. In the root, a low activity of SS was detectable only in the tillering but not in other stages. Immunoblotting of SS protein extracted from different parts of rice showed two bands. Elution patterns of crude extracts from a gel filtration column showed the presence of several types of SS protein. Among them, two to three types with larger elution volumes had the SS activity but others with smaller elution volumes (considered as the aggregated forms) had no activity. The SS purified from different parts of the plant showed similar but distinctly different electrophoretic mobilities in a native gel. It has been concluded that different isozymes are expressed in different tissues at different growth stages. 3aOryza sativa 3achemical composition 3asucrose synthase 3aenzyme activity 3aphysicochemical properties 3adiurnal variation 3aisozymes 0agrowth rate1 aLing, T.Y.1 aJuang, R.H.1 aTing, I.N.1 aSung, H.Y.1 aSu, J.C.0 tPlant physiology.g1990 Nov., v. 94, no. 3 p.1456-1461x0032-08897nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02116naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001900129245010100148300001800249300002300267500001500290520097200305650003501277650001701312650003001329650001501359650002001374650002201394650001901416650002001435653002301455653003001478700001601508700001601524700001701540700001801557773007601575852000901651939003301660946001301693655001201706IND9100598520221120211643.0910205e199011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND910059852DNAL7 a166678462pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSongstad, D.D.10aHigh levels of tryptamine accumulation in transgenic tobacco expressing tryptophan decarboxylase  ap. 1410-1413.  ap. 1410-1413. ill.  a2019-12-05  aA full-length complementary DNA clone encoding tryptophan decarboxylase (TDC; EC 4.1.1.28) from Catharanthus roseus (De Luca V, Marineou C, Brisson N [1989] Proc Nad Acad Sci USA 86: 2582-2586) driven by the CaMV 35S promoter was introduced into tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) to direct the synthesis of the protoalkaloid tryptamine from endogenous tryptophan.

R.q(John R.)10aPhysical activity and resting metabolic rate  ap. 621-634.  aIncludes references  aThe direct effects of physical activity interventions on energy expenditure are relatively small when placed in the context of total daily energy demands. Hence, the suggestion has been made that exercise produces energetic benefits in other components of the daily energy budget, thus generating a net effect on energy balance much greater than the direct energy cost of the exercise alone. Resting metabolic rate (RMR) is the largest component of the daily energy budget in most human societies and, therefore, any increases in RMR in response to exercise interventions are potentially of great importance. Animal studies have generally shown that single exercise events and longer-term training produce increases in RMR. This effect is observed in longer-term interventions despite parallel decreases in body mass and fat mass. Flight is an exception, as both single flights and long-term flight training induce reductions in RMR. Studies in animals that measure the effect of voluntary exercise regimens on RMR are less commonly performed and do not show the same response as that to forced exercise. In particular, they indicate that exercise does not induce elevations in RMR. Many studies of human subjects indicate a short-term elevation in RMR in response to single exercise events (generally termed the excess post-exercise O2 consumption; EPOC). This EPOC appears to have two phases, one lasting 2 h and a smaller much more prolonged effect lasting up to 48 h. Many studies have shown that long-term training increases RMR, but many other studies have failed to find such effects. Data concerning long-term effects of training are potentially confounded by some studies not leaving sufficient time after the last exercise bout for the termination of the long-term EPOC. Long-term effects of training include increases in RMR due to increases in lean muscle mass. Extreme interventions, however, may induce reductions in RMR, in spite of the increased lean tissue mass, similar to the changes observed in animals in response to flight. 3aexercise 3aflight 3along term effects 3aoxygen 3aresting metabolic rate 2aAdipose Tissuexmetabolism 2aAnimals 2aBasal Metabolismxphysiology 2aEnergy Metabolismxphysiology 2aExercisexphysiology 2aHumans 2aModels, Animal 2aMuscle, Skeletalxmetabolism 2aOxygen Consumption 2aPhysical Conditioning, Animalxphysiology 2aTime Factors1 aSelman, Colin0 tProceedings of the Nutrition Society.g2003 Aug., v. 62, no. 3 p.621-634dCABI Pub. on behalf of the Nutrition Societyx0029-66517nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1079/PNS20032823Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02391naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002400111040001800135072000900153100001800162245012900180300001600309500002400325500001500349520069400364650001701058650002201075650001101097650001401108650001901122650002701141650002001168650001401188650001201202650002101214650002501235650002901260650002701289650002401316650001301340650002401353650002501377650002501402650000901427653002601436700001501462773010901477852000901586856007401595856011101669930003301780945001301813946001101826655001201837IND2328425920221120200612.0020808e200202  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232842592DNAL7 a118526422pmid7 a10.1002/ps.4362doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL8211 aKaufman, P.E.10aSusceptibility of house flies (Diptera: Muscidae) exposed to commercial insecticides on painted and unpainted plywood panels  ap. 174-178.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aHouse flies were collected from dairies in New York state and the levels of resistance to commercially available insecticide formulations were measured on painted and unpainted plywood panels.

The origins of the South African canning peach industry can be traced back to a peach from St. Helena, which was the progenitor of the Transvaal yellow non-melting cling type peaches. A chance seedling of this type was released as 'Kakamas' in 1932. This cultivar and 'Early Dawn', a mutation of the English cultivar 'Duke of York', were extensively used as parents in the early days of the breeding programme, indicating a narrow genetic base of the founder cultivars. These cultivars, together with 'Muir' and 'Elberta', imported from America, served as parents for breeding drying types. Desirable traits for the processing industries are uniform firm fruit, without a prominent suture or fruit point, small stones without stone extensions and no red coloration in the stone cavity or on the skin, no browning, high sugar content, skin with less or no pubescence, and a prolonged cropping season; adaptation to medium to low chilling requirement is also important. Recent developments from the breeding programme include white-fleshed cling stone peaches for canning and yellow freestone nectarine cultivars suitable for drying. To address evolving industry needs, germplasm collections are being supplemented with material from foreign genebanks to expand the genetic base of the breeding programme. The intention is to use molecular markers to identify and characterise appropriate breeding parents. Diverse segregating breeding progenies are being developed to underpin genetic studies on fruit quality traits. Concomitantly, breeders are being trained in molecular and mapping techniques to infuse the breeding programme with a molecular genetic approach to cultivar development. 3abreeding 3acanning 3achilling requirement 3acolor 3acultivars 3adrying 3afruit quality 3agene banks 3agenetic background 3agenetic markers 3agermplasm conservation 3aindustry 3amutation 3anectarines 3aparents 3apeaches 3aseedlings 3asugar content 3aSouth Africa0 tActa horticulturae.g2013 Feb., , no. 976 p.445-447dInternational Society for Horticultural Sciencex0567-75727nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.actahort.org/books/976/976_62.htm3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02899naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002200110245013500132300001600267500012700283500002400410500001500434520151200449650001101961650003001972650001302002650002102015650001102036650002302047650001302070650001202083650002002095650001502115650001002130650001202140650002002152653001002172700003002182700001802212700001802230773012202248852000902370856008602379655001202465IND4471885020221120181856.0130916s2013    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447188502DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAntanaviciute, L.10aTargeted development and mapping of functional molecular markers in an apple rootstock (Malus × domestica Borkh.) mapping progeny  ap. 455-462.  aPaper presented at the XIII Eucarpia Symposium on Fruit Breeding and Genetics, held September 11-15, 2011, Warsaw, Poland.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-05  aThe cultivated apple (Malus × domestica Borkh.) is an economically important crop, which is widely grown throughout the world. The identification of genes involved in traits of agronomic importance and the development of molecular markers for these genes is the key to the development of marker-assisted selection in breeding programs. Several genetic maps have been reported for apple, but the focus of these maps has been mainly on scion (fruit variety) crosses. In this investigation we aim to use information from the published apple genome sequence to develop intron-spanning primer pairs from the exons of Malus genes identified from within genetic regions of low marker density on a pre-existing SSR-based linkage map of an apple rootstock cross ‘M.27’ × ‘M.116’ (M432). Eighteen ‘gaps’ – regions larger than 10 cM containing no genetic markers – were identified for gene-specific primer design. BLAST analysis produced 2,536 possible contig matches. The most significant 319 matches were selected and identified on 249 scaffolds. A total number of 180 gene-specific primers have been designed around the introns of genes located in these scaffolds. A set of 98 primers amplified single products in the parental genotypes whereas 62 amplified two products. Polymorphic markers developed within these scaffolds will increase marker density within regions. This communication details targeted development of markers for the improved saturation of the M432 apple rootstock linkage map. 3aapples 3amarker-assisted selection 3acrossing 3aagronomic traits 3ascions 3achromosome mapping 3agenotype 3aprogeny 3aMalus domestica 3arootstocks 3aexons 3aintrons 3agenetic markers 0agenes1 aFernández-Fernández, F.1 aSargent, D.J.1 aDunwell, J.M.0 tActa horticulturae.g2013 Feb., , no. 976 p.455-462dInternational Society for Horticultural Sciencex0567-75727nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.actahort.org/books/976/976_64.htm3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03159naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001400129245018300143300001800326500001500344520183500359650001402194650003302208650001602241650002002257650001702277650001502294650002002309650001102329650002502340650001902365650001702384650001402401653001302415653001402428653001402442700001402456700001802470700001702488700001802505773009802523852000902621930003302630945001302663946001302676655001202689IND2051046620221120171625.0960429e199603  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205104662DNAL7 a165352532pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFukui, R.10aRelationship between symptom development and actual sites of infection in leaves of anthurium inoculated with a bioluminescent strain of Xanthomonas campestris pv. dieffenbachiae  ap. 1021-1028.  a2019-12-05  aThe infection process of bacterial blight of anthurium was monitored with a bioluminescent strain of Xanthomonas campestris pv. dieffenbachiae. The relationship between symptom expression on infected leaves (assessed visually) and the extent of bacterial movement within tissues (evaluated by bioluminescence emission) varied among anthurium cultivars. In several cultivars previously considered susceptible on the basis of symptom development alone, bacterial invasion of leaves extended far beyond the visually affected areas. In other cultivars previously considered resistant, bacterial invasion was restricted to areas with visible symptoms. In three cultivars previously considered resistant, leaves were extensively invaded by the bacterium, and yet few or no symptoms were seen on infected leaves. The pathogen was consistently recovered from leaf sections emitting bioluminescence but not from sections emitting no light. At an early stage of infection, no significant differences in the percentages of infected areas as determined by visual assessment were observed in any of the cultivars. However, differences among cultivars were detected by bioluminescence as the disease progressed, because bacterial invasion was not always accompanied by symptom expression. In susceptible cultivars, the advancing border of infection was 5 to 10 cm inward from the margins of the visible symptoms and often reached to the leaf petiole even when symptoms were visible in <10% of the total leaf area. Comparisons of anthurium cultivars in which a nondestructive method was used to quantify the severity of leaf infection by a bioluminescent pathogen have enabled us to evaluate susceptibility and resistance to bacterial blight accurately. Such evaluations will be of importance in breeding resistant cultivars for disease control. 3acultivars 3aplant diseases and disorders 3aXanthomonas 3arecombinant DNA 3aluminescence 3aluciferase 3agene expression 3aleaves 3aAnthurium andraeanum 3areporter genes 3apathogenesis 3ainfection 0asymptoms 0aAnthurium 0alux genes1 aFukui, H.1 aMcElhaney, R.1 aNelson, S.C.1 aAlvarez, A.M.0 tApplied and environmental microbiology.g1996 Mar., v. 62, no. 3 p.1021-1028x0099-22407nnas  aDNAL  a19960605b19960611c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle02449naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245013600127300001600263500012700279500002400406520101100430650002201441650002001463650001101483650002001494650001101514650003201525650001801557650001201575650001301587650002801600700001301628700001301641700001901654700001601673700001601689700001601705700002101721700002001742700002401762773012201786852000901908856008601917655001202003IND4471885920221120171707.0130916s2013    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447188592DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWöhner, TH.10aQTL mapping for resistance to fire blight using several Erwinia amylovora strains resulting in different host-pathogen interactions  ap. 509-512.  aPaper presented at the XIII Eucarpia Symposium on Fruit Breeding and Genetics, held September 11-15, 2011, Warsaw, Poland.  aIncludes references  aQTL mapping of fire blight resistance in apple is an effective tool to determine associations between regions in the genome of apple and resistance to the bacterial disease. Several wild Malus accessions of different apple species have been identified as resistant to fire blight making them valuable as donors for the introgression of resistance to the cultivated apple Malus × domestica Borkh. Resistant accessions of the wild species M. baccata, M. fusca and M. × robusta 5 (Mr5) were inoculated with the wild type strain Ea1189 and the AvrRpt2EA deletion mutant (pZYRKD3-1). While M. baccata and M. fusca showed no symptoms to pZYRKD3-1, the resistance of M. × robusta 5 was overcome by pZYRKD3-1 with an average necrosis length of 52% respectively. Inoculation of the mapping population 'Idared' × Mr5 with the strain Ea 1189 results in the confirmation of the QTL on LG 3 in Mr5; this QTL completely broke down after inoculation with pZYRKD3-1, but two minor QTLs on LG 7 and LG 11 were detected. 3aErwinia amylovora 3aMalus domestica 3aapples 3afire resistance 3agenome 3ahost-pathogen relationships 3aintrogression 3amutants 3anecrosis 3aquantitative trait loci1 aVogt, I.1 aPeil, A.1 aFlachowsky, H.1 aHanke, M.V.1 aRichter, K.1 aGessler, C.1 aBroggini, G.A.L.1 aFahrentrapp, J.1 aGarcia-Libreros, T.0 tActa horticulturae.g2013 Feb., , no. 976 p.509-512dInternational Society for Horticultural Sciencex0567-75727nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.actahort.org/books/976/976_72.htm3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle01573naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001600129245009700145300001800242520049800260650000900758650001700767650002000784650002200804650002400826650001900850653001600869653001100885653003300896700001400929700001500943700001500958700001900973700001700992773009801009852000901107930003301116945001301149946001301162655001201175IND2051047020221120160944.0960429e199603  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205104702DNAL7 a165352542pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBaranyi, J.12aA combined model for growth and subsequent thermal inactivation of Brochothrix thermosphacta  ap. 1029-1035.  aA mathematical technique for integrating growth and thermal inactivation models of microorganisms into a smooth combined model that can be applied to circumstances under which the temperature gradually rises from growth to inactivation regions is described.

These are the southernmost distribution records of the D. obscura group in the Oriental Region. The three new species are each morphologically similar to different species of the Old World D. obscura species subgroup. This suggests that they are descendants of different founder species that independently colonized the tropics from the subtropical or temperate zones during the glacial ages. The new species D. hypercephala is hypercephalic not only in males but also, although less distinct, in females, unlike other hypercephalic drosophilid species in which only males are hypercephalic. This new finding of a hypercephalic species from the subgenus Sophophora, of which species are relatively easy to culture in the laboratory and include the model species such as D. melanogaster and D. pseudoobscura, will promote genetic analyses on the development and the evolution of hypercephaly. 3aDrosophila melanogaster 3aDrosophila obscura 3aaltitude 3aevolution 3afemales 3agenetic techniques and protocols 3amales 3anew species 3atemperate zones 3atropics 3aBorneo 3aMalaysia 0ahypercephaly 0aOriental Region1 aTANABE, Shin-ichi1 aTODA, Masanori J.0 tEntomological science.g2009 Sept., v. 12, no. 3 p.270-283dMelbourne, Australia : Blackwell Publishing Asiax1343-87867nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1479-8298.2009.00332.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20090925b20091106c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02624naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100003000145245011500175300001600290500001900306500002400325520129600349650002901645650002001674650001401694650002901708650001501737650001401752650003001766650002401796650001501820650001801835650001201853650002701865650001301892651002801905700001901933700001901952700001701971700002301988773011002011852000902121856004802130655001202178IND4420321020221120130313.0090508e200906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442032102DNAL7 a10.1007/s10841-008-9175-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSoland-Reckeweg, Gabriele10aGene flow in admixed populations and implications for the conservation of the Western honeybee, Apis mellifera  ap. 317-328.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aIncludes references  aAnthropogenic activity, especially modern apiculture, has considerable impact on the natural distribution of the Western honeybee, Apis mellifera, leading to the spread, replacement and fragmentation of many subspecies. This creates demand for the conservation of some subspecies, in particular, Apis mellifera mellifera, which once was widely distributed in Western Europe and nowadays is endangered through habitat loss and fragmentation. Moreover, A. m. mellifera may be further endangered by hybridisation in populations that now occur in artificial sympatry with other subspecies. Here, we quantify and compare individual hybridisation between sympatric and allopatric honeybee populations of A. m. mellifera and A. m. carnica using microsatellite markers and a Bayesian model-based approach. We had a special focus on pure breeding populations, which are a major tool in honeybee conservation. Our results demonstrate that subspecies are still highly differentiated, but gene flow is not prevented by the current management strategies, creating urgent demand for an improved conservation management of A. m. mellifera. However, the occurrence of a high number of pure individuals might suggest that some sort of hybrid barrier acts against the complete admixture of the two subspecies. 3aApis mellifera mellifera 3aBayesian theory 3aallopatry 3aanthropogenic activities 3aapiculture 3agene flow 3ageographical distribution 3ahabitat destruction 3ahoney bees 3ahybridization 3ahybrids 3amicrosatellite repeats 3asympatry 3aWestern European region1 aHeckel, Gerald1 aNeumann, Peter1 aFluri, Peter1 aExcoffier, Laurent0 tJournal of insect conservation.g2009 June, v. 13, no. 3 p.317-328dSpringer Netherlandsx1366-638X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10841-008-9175-0 7aarticle02170naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002100152245011900173300001600292500002400308520104200332650003001374650001801404650001301422650001901435650001401454650001001468650001501478650002301493650001001516650001201526650001401538700002701552700002801579773012501607852000901732856005501741655001201796IND4448003820221120105800.0110125e201102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444800382DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1471-0307.2010.00645.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNOUSIA, FENIA G.10aSurvival of Lactobacillus acidophilus LMGP-21381 in probiotic ice cream and its influence on sensory acceptability  ap. 130-136.  aIncludes references  aProbiotic ice cream was produced by incorporating Lactobacillus acidophilus LMGP-21381 in a standard ice cream mix at initial population above 10⁷ cfu/g.

The product was assessed for the survival of the probiotic strain during the freezing process and during 45 weeks of storage at −15°C and −25°C, and also for its sensory characteristics. The results showed that the freezing process caused a significant decrease in the viability of the freeze-dried culture, but no significant change in the viable counts of L. acidophilus was observed during frozen storage. The sensory attributes of aroma, taste and texture obtained high scores in the sensory evaluation.

The lowest levels of proteolysis and development of acidity were obtained in the cheese made using strain MBLL9. 3aLactococcus lactis subsp. lactis 3aacidity 3acasein 3acheeses 3agel electrophoresis 3anitrogen 3apH 3aproteolysis 3areversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography1 aHAYALOGLU, ALI A.1 aÖzer, Barbaros.1 aAKÇELIK, MUSTAFA1 aAKKOÇ, NEFISE0 tInternational journal of dairy technology.g2011 Aug., v. 64, no. 3 p.394-401dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx1364-727X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1471-0307.2011.00673.x 7aarticle02989naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002800092024002200120024001900142040001800161100002200179245014500201300001600346500001900362500002400381506007600405520171600481506003702197650001602234650001902250650001802269650002002287650001402307650001002321650000902331700001802340700001902358700002102377773010602398852000902504856007802513655001202591IND4449062720221207130149.0110211e201102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444906272DNAL7 a10.1093/pcp/pcq2032doi7 aPMC30370812pmcid7 a212171252pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aObayashi, Takeshi10aATTED-II Updates: Condition-Specific Gene Coexpression to Extend Coexpression Analyses and Applications to a Broad Range of Flowering Plants  ap. 213-219.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aATTED-II (http://atted.jp) is a gene coexpression database for a wide variety of experimental designs, such as prioritizations of genes for functional identification and analyses of the regulatory relationships among genes. Here, we report updates of ATTED-II focusing on two new features: condition-specific coexpression and homologous coexpression with rice. To analyze a broad range of biological phenomena, it is important to collect data under many diverse experimental conditions, but the meaning of coexpression can become ambiguous under these conditions. One approach to overcome this difficulty is to calculate the coexpression for each set of conditions with a clear biological meaning. With this viewpoint, we prepared five sets of experimental conditions (tissue, abiotic stress, biotic stress, hormones and light conditions), and users can evaluate the coexpression by employing comparative gene lists and switchable gene networks. We also developed an interactive visualization system, using the Cytoscape web system, to improve the network representation. As the second update, rice coexpression is now available. The previous version of ATTED-II was specifically developed for Arabidopsis, and thus coexpression analyses for other useful plants have been difficult. To solve this problem, we extended ATTED-II by including comparison tables between Arabidopsis and rice. This representation will make it possible to analyze the conservation of coexpression among flowering plants. With the ability to investigate condition-specific coexpression and species conservation, ATTED-II can help researchers to clarify the functional and regulatory networks of genes in a broad array of plant species.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aArabidopsis 3aabiotic stress 3abiotic stress 3acell physiology 3adatabases 3agenes 3arice1 aNishida, Kozo1 aKasahara, Kota1 aKinoshita, Kengo0 tPlant & cell physiology.g2011 Feb., v. 52, no. 2 p.213-219dOxford University Pressx0032-07817nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/pcp/pcq2033Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03291naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100002000129245008200149300001800231300002300249500001500272520223500287650001102522650002002533650002102553650001702574650001202591650002502603650002002628650001302648653003302661653001602694653001902710700001902729700001402748773007602762852000902838939003302847946001302880655001202893IND9100597420221120054301.0910205e199011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND910059742DNAL7 a166678352pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBlackwell, R.D.10aPhotorespiratory mutants of the mitochondrial conversion of glycine to serine  ap. 1316-1322.  ap. 1316-1322. ill.  a2019-12-05  aTwo mutants of barley (Hordeum vulgare L.), LaPr 85/55 and LaPr 87/30, have been isolated that accumulate glycine, with a concomitant reduction in the aminodonors glutamate and alanine, when transferred to air. Studies have shown that these plants have wild-type levels of serine transhydroxymethylase (EC 2.1.2.1) activity. When supplied 14 CO2, 48 and 66% of the supplied carbon was retained as glycine in LaPr 85/55 and LaPr 87/30, respectively, compared with a value of 11% for the wild type. In the short-term, both mutant plants are unable to metabolize [14C] glycine, but when fed the isotope for 2 hours, LaPr 85/55 was able to metabolize most (70%) of the supplied carbon into sugars with only 15% remaining in glycine. LaPr 87/30, however, was unable to metabolize more than 4% of the supplied carbon into sugars even after 2 hours. Measurement of glycine decarboxylase (EC 2.1.2.10) activity via the glycine-bicarbonate exchange reaction showed LaPr 85/55 to have approximately 70% wild-type activity with LaPr 87/30 having only 14% wild-type activity. The approximation of LaPr 85/55 to wild-type activities was maintained for 14CO2 release from [14C]glycine feeding and ammonia accumulation in the presence of methionine sulphoximine with the equivalent rates for LaPr 87/30 being less than 40% and 10%, respectively. CO2 fixation rates for the mutants fell to between 35 and 40% of wild-type rates within 10 min of transfer to air. This was shown to be partly due to a run down of amino-donors, because when 40 millimolar serine was supplied through the xylem stream these rates recovered for both mutants to 70% of the wild-type rate. These data suggested a mutation in a glycine transport system for LaPr 85/55 and in the proteins of glycine decarboxylase for LaPr 87/30. Western blotting with antisera to the P, H, T, and L proteins of glycine decarboxylase showed cross-reaction against all four proteins for LaPr 85/55 but little cross-reaction against P or H protein for LaPr 87/30, reaffirming the possibility of a transport mutation in LaPr 85/55. We also suggest that genes for P and H proteins could be either coordinately regulated or that one protein is undetectable unstable in the absence of the other. 3aserine 3aHordeum vulgare 3aphotorespiration 3amitochondria 3amutants 3aglycine (amino acid) 3aenzyme activity 3aseed set 0aserine transhydroxymethylase 0aamino acids 0aphotosynthesis1 aMurray, A.J.S.1 aLea, P.J.0 tPlant physiology.g1990 Nov., v. 94, no. 3 p.1316-1322x0032-08897nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02572naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002800111040001800139100002500157245008500182300001600267500002400283520115400307650001501461650001201476650001701488650001401505650001401519650001401533650001301547650001701560650001201577650001101589650001901600650004601619650002401665650003701689650002301726650003201749650005401781650003501835700001701870773014001887852000902027856007802036655001202114IND4472473420221120054247.0130920s2003    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447247342DNAL7 a150184792pmid7 a10.1079/PNS20032992doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFearon, Kenneth C.H.14aThe nutritional management of surgical patients: enhanced recovery after surgery  ap. 807-811.  aIncludes references  aMalnutrition has long been recognised as a risk factor for post-operative morbidity and mortality. Traditional metabolic and nutritional care of patients undergoing major elective surgery has emphasised pre-operative fasting and re-introduction of oral nutrition 3–5 d after surgery. Attempts to attenuate the consequent nutritional deficit and to influence post-operative morbidity and mortality have included parenteral, enteral and oral sip feeding. Recent studies have emphasised that an enhanced rate of recovery can be achieved by a multi-modal approach focused on modulating the metabolic status of the patient before (e.g. carbohydrate and fluid loading), during (e.g. epidural anaesthesia) and after (e.g. early oral feeding) surgery. Using such an approach preliminary results on patients undergoing elective colo-rectal surgery indicate a significant reduction in hospital stay (traditional care, n 48, median stay 10 d v. enhanced recovery programme, n 33, median stay 7d; P<0·01) can be achieved. Such findings emphasise the potential role of multi-modal care programmes in the promotion of early recovery from major surgical trauma. 3aanesthesia 3afasting 3amalnutrition 3amorbidity 3amortality 3anutrition 3apatients 3arisk factors 3asurgery 2aHumans 2aLength of Stay 2aNutrition Disordersxprevention & control 2aNutritional Support 2aOutcome Assessment, Health Care. 2aPerioperative Care 2aPostoperative Carexmethods 2aPostoperative Complicationsxprevention & control 2aSurgical Procedures, Operative1 aLuff, Rachel0 tProceedings of the Nutrition Society.g2003 Nov., v. 62, no. 4 p.807-811dCABI Pub. on behalf of the Nutrition Societyx0029-66517nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1079/PNS20032993Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02863naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002700111040001800138100002100156245009600177300001600273500002400289520129500313650001901608650002001627650002501647650001201672650001801684650001501702650001501717650001901732650001601751650001301767650001201780650002401792650002201816650002801838650005501866650004101921650006501962650003102027650002002058650003002078650001902108700002202127773013402149852000902283856007702292655001202369IND4423131720221120050425.0090710s2009    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442313172DNAL7 a188257262pmid7 a10.1002/tox.204412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYi, Pyŏng-t'ae.10aLysosomal membrane response of earthworm, Eisenia fetida, to arsenic contamination in soils  ap. 369-376.  aIncludes references  aEarthworm (Eisenia fetida) were exposed to sandy soils contaminated with arsenate (0.01-0.3 μmol g⁻¹) for 28 days. Lysosomal membrane stability was used as a biomarker to determine the applicability of neutral-red retention times (NRRTs) for arsenic (As) toxicity to earthworm in soils. Total As and As speciation were analyzed to evaluate dose-response relationship between As accumulation and NRRTs and to observe the role of As metabolism in earthworms on a subcellular level toxicity. Significant decrease of NRRTs was found with the increasing As concentration in soils (ANOVA, P < 0.05). Adverse effects on earthworm survival and growth did not occur when exposed to 0.1 and 0.05 μmol g⁻¹ at 14 and 28 days, respectively, whereas NRRTs showed significant reduction from the control, as was readily bioconcentrated in the reduced form of As(III) in earthworms and clear dose-response relationships were found for As body burden and NRRTs. Therefore, it is possible to conclude that As has an adverse effect on lysosomal membrane of coelomocytes, and NRRT assay is a potentially applicable method to assess As toxicity as an early warning tool. Also, sequestered As in the form of As(III)-thiol complex can be expected to cause an adverse effect on lysosomal membrane stability. 3aEisenia fetida 3aadverse effects 3aanalysis of variance 3aarsenic 3adose response 3aearthworms 3ametabolism 3apolluted soils 3asandy soils 3atoxicity 2aAnimals 2aArsenatesxtoxicity 2aArsenicxtoxicity 2aBiomarkersxmetabolism. 2aIntracellular Membranesxdrug effectsxmetabolism. 2aLysosomesxdrug effectsxmetabolism. 2aOligochaetaxdrug effectsxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aReproductionxdrug effects 2aSoilxanalysis. 2aSoil Pollutantsxtoxicity 2aToxicity Tests1 aKim, Kyoung-Woong0 tEnvironmental toxicology.g2009 Aug., v. 24, no. 4 p.369-376dWiley Subscription Services, Inc., A Wiley Companyx1520-40817nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/tox.204413Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle01862naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002800111040001800139100001600157245007600173300001800249520082200267650000901089650001201098650001401110650001001124650001501134650001701149650001801166650001001184650002101194700002101215773010601236852000901342856007801351930003301429945001301462946001301475655001201488IND2045221520221120033458.0950323e199411  nyu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204522152DNAL7 a242419272pmid7 a10.1007/BF020984012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHeale, V.R.10aToluene and weasel (2-propylthietane) odors suppress feeding in the rat  ap. 2953-2958.  aThe odors of toluene and 2-propylthietane have been shown to elicit fast wave bursts of 15-30 Hz in the olfactory bulb and dentate gyrus of rats.

The biological toxicity effect of TBBPA and HBCD was studied by means of zebrafish embryo toxicity assays in combination with three biomarkers, including superoxide dismutase (SOD), lipid peroxidation, (LPO), and heat shock protein (Hsp70). The standard zebrafish embryo assay showed that high concentrations of TBBPA (greater-than-or-equal0.75 mg/L) can cause lethality or malformation. For HBCD within the concentration range (0.002-10 mg/L), no endpoint was observed. Furthermore, SOD activities of zebrafish embryos exposed to TBBPA were increased with the increasing concentrations. SOD activities in the group treated by HBCD showed an increase followed by a decline. Regardless of TBBPA or HBCD, LPO were increased along with the increase of the concentration. The change pattern of Hsp70 levels was the same with LPO. All these results showed that TBBPA and HBCD could cause oxidative stress and Hsp70 overexpression, inducing acute toxicity to zebrafish embryo in a short-term exposure. The study also indicates that the zebrafish embryo assay in combination with the biomarkers is effective in aquatic environmental toxicology and risk assessment. 3aDanio rerio 3aacute toxicity 3aaquatic environment 3abiomarkers 3aecotoxicology 3aflame retardants 3aheat shock proteins 3alipid peroxidation 3aoxidative stress 3arisk assessment 3asuperoxide dismutase 2aAnimals 2aBiological Assayxmethods 2aBiomarkers, Pharmacologicalxmetabolism 2aEmbryo, Nonmammalianxdrug effectsxmetabolism. 2aFlame Retardantsxtoxicity 2aHSP70 Heat-Shock Proteinsxmetabolism 2aHydrocarbons, Brominatedxtoxicity 2aLipid Peroxidationxdrug effects 2aMalondialdehydexmetabolism 2aPolybrominated Biphenylsxtoxicity 2aSuperoxide Dismutasexmetabolism 2aToxicity Tests 2aZebrafishxembryologyxmetabolism.1 aLiang, Yong1 aChen, Minjie1 aWang, Xiaorong0 tEnvironmental toxicology.g2009 Aug., v. 24, no. 4 p.334-342dWiley Subscription Services, Inc., A Wiley Companyx1520-40817nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/tox.204363Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle01882naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002800111040001800139100001400157245010500171300001800276520069200294650003900986650001901025650001901044650002301063650001801086650002901104650002101133650001401154650001601168653001501184653001101199700001401210700001401224773008801238852000901326856007801335930003301413945001301446946001301459655001201472IND2039255720221117163043.0940504e199311  nyu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203925572DNAL7 a242487252pmid7 a10.1007/BF009807052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYun, K.W.10aPhytotoxic and antimicrobial activity of volatile constituents of Artemisia princeps var. orientalis  ap. 2757-2766.  aThe volatile constituents of Artemisia princeps var. orientalis (wormwood) were investigated for phytotoxic and antimicrobial activities.

Previous field studies showed that them were about 80% fewer black cherry seedlings where fern was present than where it was absent. Allelopathic interference with black cherry seed germination, seedling survival, and growth by hay-scented fern foliage leachates, root washings, and soil transformation products was evaluated in a series of field, greenhouse, and laboratory experiments. Black cherry seeds germinated as well in the presence of hay-scented fern or its leachates as when they were absent in both the laboratory and the field. Fern foliage leachates and root washings did not affect black cherry growth in sand or natural soil cores in the greenhouse. There also was no evidence that hay-scented fern natural products or their soil transformation products built up in the soil. A two-year manipulative field experiment to separate effects of hay-scented fern foliage shade from foliar leaching showed that foliage shade significantly reduced black cherry seedling survival and growth; foliage leachates had no effect. Results of the studies led to the conclusion that allelopathy does not play a direct role in hay-scented fern interference with black cherry seedling establishment in partially cut Allegheny hardwood stands. 3aseed germination 3aDennstaedtia punctilobula 3ahardwood 3aseedlings 3aallelopathy 3aPrunus serotina 3amortality 0aregeneration 0agrowth0 tJournal of chemical ecology.g1993 Nov., v. 19, no. 11 p.2737-2755x0098-03317nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF009807043Available from publisher's Web site  a19940603b19940609c00000000  aINDdRAE  aOther US 7aarticle03319naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002800111040001800139100002000157245010800177300001800285520192300303650002602226650002602252650002102278650001802299650001302317650001602330650001402346650002702360650002102387650002002408650001402428650002702442650001402469650001402483650002902497650002302526653001602549653001502565653002302580773008802603852000902691856007802700930003302778945001302811946001302824655001202837IND2039253720221123030922.0940504e199311  nyu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203925372DNAL7 a242487172pmid7 a10.1007/BF009806972doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSlansky, F. Jr.10aXanthine toxicity to caterpillars synergized by allopurinol, a xanthine dehydrogenase/oxidase inhibitor  ap. 2635-2650.  aXanthine (2,6-dioxypurine), which occurs in certain legumes and other plants, was fed in artificial diet to larvae of two noctuid moth species, a legume specialist, Anticarsia gemmatalis, and a generalist, Spodoptera frugiperda. In addition, diets either lacked or contained allopurinol (4-hydroxypyrazolo(3,4-d)-pyrimidine), an inhibitor of xanthine dehydrogenase and oxidase, enzymes that convert xanthine to uric acid. Xanthine alone (up to 2% fresh mass, fm) had little deleterious effect on either species, whereas allopurinol alone (up to 1% fm) had moderate but significant effects, increasing mortality, slowing development, and reducing insect biomass. At 0.5% fm allopurinol, the decrease in biomass-relative growth rate (RGR) was associated with reductions in the efficiency of conversion to biomass of digested food (ECD; both species) and in the biomass-relative consumption rate (RCR; A. gemmatalis). In addition, pupae of each species from allopurinol-fed larvae had increased water retention (i.e., lower percentage dry mass) compared with insects consuming control diet. When fed diet containing both compounds (1% fm xanthine + 0.5% fm allopurinol), no A. gemmatalis and only 40% of S. frugiperda larvae reached the prepupal stage; additionally for the latter species, there was a substantial slowing of growth and reductions in final biomass, RGR, RCR, and ECD. These results indicate a synergistic interaction, in which the effects of xanthine and allopurinol combined in the diet were significantly greater than the additive effects of each compound tested separately. Presumably, the inhibition of xanthine dehydrogenase by allopurinol prevented the absorbed xanthine from being converted to uric acid and excreted. In addition, this study expands the phenomenon of phytochemical detoxification by insects to include xanthine dehydrogenase, an enzyme generally not considered within this context. 3aAnticarsia gemmatalis 3aSpodoptera frugiperda 3aartificial diets 3adose response 3axanthine 3aallopurinol 3asynergism 3axanthine dehydrogenase 3axanthine oxidase 3aenzyme activity 3amortality 3abiological development 3auric acid 3aexcretion 3ametabolic detoxification 3abiomass production 0agrowth rate 0ainhibition 0adevelopmental time0 tJournal of chemical ecology.g1993 Nov., v. 19, no. 11 p.2635-2650x0098-03317nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF009806973Available from publisher's Web site  a19940603b19940609c00000000  aINDdRAE  aOther US 7aarticle02081naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001200110245015500122300001800277500001500295520113900310650002501449650001601474650001801490650001901508650002101527653002101548653001401569700001601583773008801599852000901687930003301696945001301729946001301742655001201755IND2039252320221123030939.0940504e199311  nyu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203925232DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShu, S.10aEvidence for a multicomponent sex pheromone in Eribornus terebrans (Gravenhorst) (Hym.: Ichneumonidae), a larval parasitoid of the European corn borer  ap. 2563-2576.  a2019-12-05  aSex pheromone activity of Eriborus terebrans (Gravenhorst) (Hymenoptera: Ichneumonidae) was recovered from acetone rinses of flasks that previously contained females. The acetone flask rinses elicited the following male responses: upwind anemotaxis, casting, hovering, landing, wing-fanning, and mating attempts with other nearby males. Activity of the. acetone flask rinse lasted up to four days on a glass substrate. Polar component and nonpolar components were demonstrated in the acetone flask rinse. The polar component elicited male behavioral responses similar to those by the acetone flask rinse, although retention of males at the pheromone source and the period of wing-fanning were of shorter duration. Chromatography data and chemical derivatization indicated that the polar component had the properties of a carboxylic acid with an additional oxygen-containing functional group. The nonpolar component acted as a synergist since it was inactive alone but increased male behavioral responses when added to the polar component. Florisil open column chromatography suggested that the nonpolar component was a hydrocarbon(s). 3achemical composition 3aparasitoids 3aIchneumonidae 3asex pheromones 3achemical ecology 0acharacterization 0aisolation1 aJones, R.L.0 tJournal of chemical ecology.g1993 Nov., v. 19, no. 11 p.2563-2576x0098-03317nnas  aDNAL  a19940603b19940609c00000000  aINDdRAE  aOther US 7aarticle01942naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002800111040001800139100001600157245011600173300001800289520071700307650001501024650001101039650002401050650001201074650002101086650001601107650002201123650001301145650001401158650002201172650001701194650002101211700001501232700001401247700001301261773008801274852000901362856007801371930003301449945001301482946001301495655001201508IND2039246120221122235111.0940504e199311  nyu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203924612DNAL7 a242487062pmid7 a10.1007/BF009806862doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShimizu, T.10aResponses of maxillary sensilla styloconica in Bombyx mori to glucosides from Osmunda japonica, a nonhost plant  ap. 2501-2512.  aWe isolated glucosides from the royal fern, Osmunda japanica, which elicit a deterrent response in larvae of Bombyx mori.

In addition, the elapsed time between the contamination of the pasture and grazing, the quantity of soil ingested together with herbage, the mechanism of absorption of the metal into blood and the presence or absence of antagonistic metals can interact to influence the rate and extent of accumulation of heavy metals in edible body tissues. Models of the accumulation of metals by grazing animals may be used to determine the statutory limits of radionuclides and PTM in soils under grazed pastures. Meta-analysis of existing data, using a random-effects model, is a useful approach to understanding the factors affecting the accumulation of some metals, e.g. Cd. The target edible body tissues for the accumulation of most PTM are the liver and kidneys, with the exception of radiocaesium, which accumulates in muscle to a greater extent than in other tissues. The livers and kidneys of mature livestock that have been grazed on areas of pasture at the legal limit of contamination by Cd for more than one grazing season should be removed from the human food chain in order to reduce the risk of intake of Cd by the human population. 3ablood 3acadmium 3aexposure duration 3aforage 3agrazing 3aheavy metals 3ahuman food chain 3ahuman population 3aintestinal absorption 3akidneys 3aliver 3alivestock 3ameta-analysis 3amodels 3apastures 3aradionuclides 3arisk 3aruminants 3asoil 2aAnimal Feedxanalysis 2aAnimal Nutritional Physiological Phenomena 2aAnimals 2aCadmiumxadministration & dosagexpharmacokinetics. 2aEnvironmental Exposure 2aFood Chain 2aFood Contamination 2aIntestinal Absorption 2aKidneyxchemistry 2aLiverxchemistry 2aMetalsxadministration & dosagexpharmacokineticsxtoxicity. 2aPoaceaexchemistry 2aRuminantsxmetabolism 2aSoilxanalysis. 2aTissue Distribution1 aHill, J.1 aPhillips, C.J.C.0 tProceedings of the Nutrition Society.g2003 May, v. 62, no. 2 p.267-277dCABI Pub. on behalf of the Nutrition Societyx0029-66517nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1079/PNS20032093Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02679naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001900152245014700171300001600318520140000334650002001734650002501754650002001779650002601799650001601825650002001841650001001861650001001871650001301881650002501894650002101919653000901940653001101949653001601960653001101976700002201987773007802009852000902087856009202096930003302188945001302221946001102234655001202245IND2198640120221122235215.0990510e199812  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND219864012DNAL7 a10.1046/j.1365-2095.1998.00061.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRamseyer, L.J.10aEffects of dietary protein to metabolizable energy ratios and total protein concentrations on the performance of yellow perch Perca flavescens  ap. 217-223.  aJuvenile yellow perch Perca flavescens were fed semipurified diets with varying protein to metabolizable energy ratios (PME, g protein MJ-1 metaholizible energy) and nutrient densities in three experiments to determine recommended dietary protein and energy concentrations. Experiment 1 fish (18.6 g) were fed diets containing 450 g crude protein kg-1 dry diet and 14.5-18.8 MJ ME kg-1 dry diet for 10 weeks. No differences were found in the growth of experiment 1 fish fed the different diets. Experiment 2 fish (21.9 g) were fed diets containing 15.7 MJ ME kg-1 dry diet and 210-420 g crude protein kg-1 dry diet for 8 weeks. Fish fed the diet containing 340 g kg-1 protein (diet PME = 22) exhibited the greatest weight gain. Experiment 3 fish (27.1 g) were fed diets with a PME of 22 and varying nutrient density (yielding 205-380 g crude protein kg-1 dry diet) for 8 weeks. No differences were found in the growth of experiment 3 fish. Yellow perch fed the semipurified diets exhibited increased liver fat content, liver size and degree of liver discoloration compared with fish fed a commercial fish meal-based diet. Liver changes may have resulted from high dietary carbohydrate levels. We conclude that a protein level of 210- 270 g kg-1 dry diet is suitable for juvenile yellow perch provided that the dietary amino acid profile and carbohydrate content are appropriate for yellow perch. 3adietary protein 3ametabolizable energy 3aprotein content 3anutrient availability 3abody weight 3aliveweight gain 3aliver 3acolor 3abody fat 3adietary carbohydrate 3aPerca flavescens 0asize 0agrowth 0aperformance 0aratios1 aGarling, D.L.

For all diets, fish reared in darkened tanks were significantly larger than those in illuminated tanks from day 8 onwards. Fish fed a combination of live Artemia plus MN-3 grew significantly more quickly than those fed either live Artemia or MN-3 only. On day 21 of the experiment, average weight of fish fed the combined diet was 649 +/- 30 mg (mean +/- SEM) in darkened tanks and 445 +/- 16 mg in illuminated tanks, while those fed Artemia alone were 242 +/- 9 and 198 +/- 13 mg (dark and light, respectively) and fish fed MN-3 only were intermediate at 377 +/- 20 and 267 +/- 16 mg (dark and light, respectively). Catfish fed the salmon starter initially grew slowly, but after day 11 grew more quickly than the other groups. Mortalities were highest for fish fed salmon feed. Permanent darkness enhances the growth of C. gariepinus larvae during and after metamorphosis. While dry diets promoted higher growth rate than live Artemia nauplii alone, a combination of the two resulted in the fastest growth. 3afish culture 3afeeds 3abody weight 3aArtemia salina 3alighting 3aClarias gariepinus 3alarvae 3amixtures 3afish feeding 3amortality 3alight 0adark 0adevelopmental stages 0agrowth1 aMcGeer, J.C.0 tAquaculture nutrition.g1998 Sept., v. 4, no. 3 p.157-164x1353-57737nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2095.1998.00064.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20060205b00000000c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle01705naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002700110245012400137300001800261520069900279650002100978650001000999650001701009650001201026650001501038650001601053650001701069650003601086650001901122650001301141653001201154653002101166773008801187852000901275930003301284945001301317946001301330655001201343IND2036531420221122091421.0940104e199211  nyu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203653142DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSunnerheim-Sjoberg, K.10a(1S,2R,4S,5S)-angelicoidenol-2-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside--a moose deterrent compound in Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.)  ap. 2025-2039.  aHydrophilic extracts of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) twigs have been investigated for palatability to moose in feeding experiments.

Of other isolated and tested substances, only taxifolin-3'-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside had a deterring effect. One fraction--containing mainly aliphatic compounds--also had a strong effect, but the effect was lost after further fractionation. Tannin-containing fractions had no effect. Angelicoidenol glucoside has not previously been reported from P. sylvestris.

Growth was affected to a minor extent, and only during the first 4 weeks of the experiment. Mortality was low and not related to dietary inositol. The inositol concentration in whole fish and liver was affected by dietary inositol supplementation. Proximate composition of whole fish was similar among dietary groups, except for positive correlations between dry matter, lipid and protein and dietary inositol supplementation after 8 weeks. Analyses of hepatic lipid classes after 8 weeks showed non-significant differences among the groups, mostly explained by somewhat reduced total hepatic lipid accumulation with increasing dietary inositol. Triacylglycerol and phosphatidylcholine accounted for 80% and 8-10% of the hepatic lipids (approximately 80 mg lipid g(-1) wet weight) in all groups. Blood haemoglobin was positively correlated and plasma triacylglycerol was negatively correlated to dietary inositol supplementation at week 28, while plasma protein and cholesterol were unaffected. The present results indicate that the requirement of Atlantic salmon fry for inositol is covered through the natural content of inositol in practical feed ingredients at around 300 mg inositol kg(-1). It may, however, be advisable to supplement starter diets with moderate amounts of inositol, around 200 mg kg(-1), to compensate for fluctuations in inositol concentrations in natural ingredients, leaching loss of inositol from the diet and for any potential increased inositol requirement in salmon fry. 3aSalmo salar 3aliver 3aphosphatidylcholines 3adevelopmental stages 3amyo-inositol 3ahemoglobin 3adosage 3atriacylglycerols 3acholesterol 3anutrient requirements 3ablood plasma 3aprotein content 3afeed supplements 3amortality 0achemical composition 0ablood chemistry 0adry matter 0alipids 0agrowth1 aSandnes, K.1 aLie, O.1 aRoem, A.0 tAquaculture nutrition.g1998 Mar., v. 4, no. 1 p.53-59x1353-57737nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2095.1998.00043.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a19990531b19990608c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle03333naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002200152245009900174300001400273520185200287650001602139650001402155650002602169650002502195650001302220650001502233650000702248650002802255650001902283650001702302650002102319650002202340650002102362650000902383650001602392650001002408650002002418650001102438650001602449650002002465650001602485650001902501650001202520653001102532700001402543773007602557852000902633856009202642930003302734945001302767946001102780655001202791IND2198767820221122042629.0990518e199803  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND219876782DNAL7 a10.1046/j.1365-2095.1998.00100.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEl-Mowafi, A.F.A.10aMagnesium requirement of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.) parr in seawater-treated fresh water  ap. 31-38.  aThis experiment was undertaken to establish the magnesium (Mg) requirement in young Atlantic salmon, Salmo salar L., in seawater-treated fresh water. In Norwegian hatcheries it is a common practice to add sodium hydroxide and/or sea water (1-2%) to improve pH and conductivity of the natural fresh water. Parr with initial weight of 8 g, were divided in six triplicate groups in brackish water containing 54 mg Mg L(-1) and fed a basal casein-gelatine diet supplemented with minor amounts of krill and fish meal (containing 200 mg Mg kg(-1)) for an initial period of 3 weeks. Thereafter the fish were fed this diet supplemented with either 0, 100, 200, 300, 400 or 500 mg Mg kg(-1) (as MgSO4) for 12 weeks. Growth and feed efficiency were recorded. Concentrations of Mg and other divalent cations (Ca and Zn) were measured in whole fish, serum and vertebrae. Sodium concentration in vertebrae was also measured. Growth and feed efficiency were unaffected by the levels of dietary magnesium used in the experiment. Magnesium concentrations in the whole body, serum and vertebrae Mg appeared to be more sensitive than growth and feed efficiency to differences in dietary Mg intake. The group fed the unsupplemented diet showed significantly lower Mg concentration in these tissues than the other groups. Whole-body calcium concentration was negatively correlated with dietary Mg and Ca:Mg ratios in the vertebrae were significantly affected by the dietary Mg levels. Zinc concentration in whole body, serum and vertebrae was not altered by the dietary Mg levels. Further, vertebral Na concentration did not vary between the dietary treatments. In conclusion, a minimum Mg supplementation level of 100 mg kg(-1) dry diet (in total, 326 mg kg(-1)) was needed to maintain Mg concentration in the whole body and serum and for proper bone mineralization. 3aSalmo salar 3amagnesium 3anutrient requirements 3adevelopmental stages 3aseawater 3afreshwater 3apH 3aelectrical conductivity 3abrackish water 3afish feeding 3afeed supplements 3amagnesium sulfate 3anutrient content 3azinc 3ablood serum 3abones 3afeed conversion 3asodium 3afeed intake 3aliveweight gain 3abody weight 3ainorganic ions 3acalcium 0agrowth1 aMaage, A.0 tAquaculture nutrition.g1998 Mar., v. 4, no. 1 p.31-38x1353-57737nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2095.1998.00100.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a19990531b19990608c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle02864naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002500152245014500177300001800322500002400340520158600364650002501950650001401975650002101989650001202010650001802022650001602040651002102056651001502077651001802092653000802110653003402118653002602152653000802178653002002186700002102206700002202227700002502249773010402274852000902378856005502387655001202442IND4412782020221122011012.0081121e200812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441278202DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-294X.2008.03970.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTHORNHILL, DANIEL J.10aOpen-ocean barriers to dispersal: a test case with the Antarctic Polar Front and the ribbon worm Parborlasia corrugatus (Nemertea: Lineidae)  ap. 5104-5117.  aIncludes references  aOpen-ocean environments provide few obvious barriers to the dispersal of marine organisms. Major currents and/or environmental gradients potentially impede gene flow. One system hypothesized to form an open-ocean dispersal barrier is the Antarctic Polar Front, an area characterized by marked temperature change, deep water, and the high-flow Antarctic Circumpolar current. Despite these potential isolating factors, several invertebrate species occur in both regions, including the broadcast-spawning nemertean worm Parborlasia corrugatus. To empirically test for the presence of an open-ocean dispersal barrier, we sampled P. corrugatus and other nemerteans from southern South America, Antarctica, and the sub-Antarctic islands. Diversity was assessed by analyzing mitochondrial 16S rRNA and cytochrome c oxidase subunit I sequence data with Bayesian inference and tcs haplotype network analysis. Appropriate neutrality tests were also employed. Although our results indicate a single well-mixed lineage in Antarctica and the sub-Antarctic, no evidence for recent gene flow was detected between this population and South American P. corrugatus. Thus, even though P. corrugatus can disperse over large geographical distances, physical oceanographic barriers (i.e. Antarctic Polar Front and Antarctic Circumpolar Current) between continents have likely restricted dispersal over evolutionary time. Genetic distances and haplotype network analysis between South American and Antarctic/sub-Antarctic P. corrugatus suggest that these two populations are possibly two cryptic species. 3acytochrome-c oxidase 3agene flow 3agenetic distance 3aislands 3aribosomal RNA 3atemperature 3aAntarctic region 3aAntarctica 3aSouth America 0a16S 0aAntarctic Circumpolar Current 0aAntarctic Polar Front 0aCOI 0acryptic species1 aMAHON, ANDREW R.1 aNORENBURG, JON L.1 aHALANYCH, KENNETH M.0 tMolecular ecology.g2008 Dec., v. 17, no. 23 p.5104-5117dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0962-10837nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-294X.2008.03970.x 7aarticle02744naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003200092040001800124100002100142245008900163300001600252500002400268520154400292650000801836650001401844650001401858650002301872650002701895650001001922650002401932650001401956650001901970650003001989650001802019650001402037650001402051650001002065650001602075650001802091650001402109773014502123852000902268856004502277655001202322IND4396444420221121235410.0071021e200704  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439644442DNAL7 a10.1002/ejlt.2006002292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMurphy, Denis J.10aFuture prospects for oil palm in the 21st century: Biological and related challenges  ap. 296-306.  aIncludes references  aOil palm is currently at a historic crossroads as regards its future prospects as a versatile global oil crop. In 2005, oil palm became the world's leading commercial source of vegetable oil, and the continued expansion of Asian economies augers well for further growth in production. There are several significant challenges that face the oil palm industry, both biological and non-biological. The major biological and managerial challenge will be to tackle the stagnating yield that has characterised average plantation output over the past decade. Yield can be enhanced by developing and efficiently propagating/distributing improved germplasm for both large plantations and smallholders. Improved biocontrol of major pests and diseases, such as Ganoderma and rhinoceros beetle, will also have a significant impact. Oil quality can be improved by diversifying fatty acid composition to produce high-oleate varieties for mainstream edible/oleochemical use, as well as other useful acyl compositions, including nutraceutical components and enhanced vitamin A and E contents for higher-value niche markets. The whole spectrum of breeding approaches, from DNA marker-assisted selection to genetic engineering, is being deployed to meet these objectives. One of the potential threats to the future growth of oil palm as a source of high-quality foods and oleochemicals is the rapid emergence of biodiesel, which might destabilise the industry in the short term and adversely impact on its image and attractiveness for longer-term investment. 3aDNA 3aGanoderma 3abiodiesel 3abiological control 3afatty acid composition 3afoods 3agenetic engineering 3agermplasm 3aimage analysis 3amarker-assisted selection 3aniche markets 3aoil crops 3apalm oils 3apests 3aplantations 3avegetable oil 3avitamin E0 tEuropean journal of lipid science and technology.g2007 Apr., v. 109, no. 4 p.296-306dWiley-VCH VerlagwJournal:jnl3921629x1438-76977nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ejlt.200600229 7aarticle03093naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002500152245013800177300001600315500002400331520162300355650001401978650001301992650002002005650001002025650001202035650003002047650001502077650001902092650001102111650002202122650001402144650002502158651002302183653001502206653002502221653001802246653002102264653002602285653001602311700001902327700002002346700001902366773012502385852000902510856009202519655001202611IND4423545320221121164837.0090724s2009    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442354532DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1095-8312.2009.01253.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMATSUMURA, SHUN'ICHI10aOrigin of the disjunct distribution of flower colour polymorphism within Limonium wrightii (Plumbaginaceae) in the Ryukyu Archipelago  ap. 709-717.  aIncludes references  aThe sea lavender, Limonium wrightii, has six morphs of flower colour variation. The geographical distribution of flower colour morphs is disjunct; the distribution of the pink flower morph is divided into two subregions, and that of the yellow flower morph intervenes between them. The present study aimed to examine the origin of this apparent distribution pattern of flower colour in L. wrightii. Two main hypotheses (i.e. past dispersal events and phenotypic changes by natural selection and/or stochastic processes) have been proposed to account for the origin of leapfrog distribution patterns. To determine which hypothesis was applicable, we conducted a molecular phylogenetic analysis using sequence variation in chloroplast DNA (three regions of intergenic spacers, trnG-trnfM, trnV-trnM, and psbA-trnH). We sequenced 58 accessions of L. wrightii frin 28 islands in the Ryukyu Archipelago and the Izu-Ogasawara Islands, located south of the Japanese mainland, and 12 accessions of four congeneric species. Within L. wrightii, we obtained four lineages of ten haplotypes. These lineages and haplotypes did not correlate with the different flower colours. These results indicate that the formation processes of populations are complex. The haplotypes of the pink flower morph did not show a sister relationship between the two disjunct subregions, indicating that the disjunct populations of the pink flower morphs are unlikely to share the pink flower colour as a result of common ancestry. We conclude that the observed leapfrog distribution pattern is caused by natural selection and/or stochastic processes. 3aLavandula 3aLimonium 3achloroplast DNA 3acolor 3aflowers 3ageographical distribution 3ahaplotypes 3aintergenic DNA 3amorphs 3anatural selection 3aphylogeny 3astochastic processes 3aRyukyu Archipelago 0aallopatric 0ageographic structure 0ainsular plant 0aleapfrog pattern 0anorth-western Pacific 0asubtropical1 aYokoyama, Jun.1 aFUKUDA, TATSUYA1 aMAKI, MASAYUKI0 tBiological journal of the Linnean Society.g2009 Aug., v. 97, no. 4 p.709-717dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0024-40667nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1095-8312.2009.01253.x3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02726naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003000092024002200122024001900144040001800163100002500181245010300206300001800309500002400327506007600351520116100427506003701588650002801625650001301653650001801666650001401684650002101698650001001719650001101729650001801740650001701758650002101775650002201796650002101818700002401839700001601863700001901879700002301898700002101921700001901942700001601961700001801977773013601995852000902131856008002140655001202220IND4408442120221207120513.0080801e20080801xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440844212DNAL7 a10.1128/AEM.00124-082doi7 aPMC25193262pmcid7 a185398002pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuglielmetti, Simone10aImplication of an Outer Surface Lipoprotein in Adhesion of Bifidobacterium bifidum to Caco-2 Cells  ap. 4695-4702.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aWe found that the human intestinal isolate Bifidobacterium bifidum MIMBb75 strongly adhered to Caco-2 cells. Proteinase K and lithium chloride treatments showed that proteins play a key role in MIMBb75 adhesion to Caco-2 cells. By studying the cell wall-associated proteins, we identified a surface protein, which we labeled BopA. We purified the protein chromatographically and found that it functioned as an adhesion promoter on Caco-2 cells. In silico analysis of the gene coding for this protein and globomycin experiments showed that BopA is a cysteine-anchored lipoprotein expressed as a precursor polypeptide. A database search indicated that BopA appears to function biologically as an oligopeptide/tripeptide-solute-binding protein in the ABC transport system. We discovered a protein corresponding to BopA and its gene in eight other highly adherent B. bifidum strains. Finally, we found that B. bifidum MIMBb75 and BopA affected the production of interleukin-8 in Caco-2 epithelial cells. BopA is the first protein described to date to be directly involved in the adhesion of bifidobacteria to Caco-2 cells and to show immunomodulatory activity.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aBifidobacterium bifidum 3aadhesion 3acell adhesion 3adatabases 3aepithelial cells 3agenes 3ahumans 3ainterleukin-8 3alipoproteins 3alithium chloride 3aprotein transport 3asurface proteins1 aTamagnini, Isabella1 aMora, Diego1 aMinuzzo, Mario1 aScarafoni, Alessio1 aArioli, Stefania1 aHellman, Jukka1 aKarp, Matti1 aParini, Carlo0 tApplied and environmental microbiology.g2008 Aug. 1, v. 74, no. 15 p.4695-4702dAmerican Society for Microbiologyx0099-22407nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1128/AEM.00124-083Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03691naa a2200805 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003100111040001800142072001700160072001700177072001700194100001800211245019300229300001800422500001500440520126200455650002301717650001601740650002301756650003701779650002501816650002701841650001801868650002801886650002501914650001101939650001601950650002801966650001201994650001602006650002102022650001302043650001402056650002002070650002802090650001202118650001102130650002502141650002802166650002902194650001702223650002702240650002202267650001002289650002802299650004202327650004002369650003502409650000902444650001002453651001302463651001302476653001702489653003802506700001502544700001802559700001502577700001802592700001802610773008402628852000902712856008102721930003302802945002502835946001302860655001202873IND4435341320221121135456.0100413e201004  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443534132DNAL7 a203384102pmid7 a10.3168/jds.2009-22942doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

The model cheeses were manufactured according to a generally representative Portuguese artisanal protocol, but the (ubiquitous) adventitious microflora in the cheesemaking milk were removed via sterilization before manufacture; therefore, the specific effects of only those lactic acid bacteria selected were monitored. In addition, 2 types of coagulant (animal and plant) and 3 types of cheesemaking milk (cow, sheep, and goat) were assessed to determine their influence on the final characteristics of the model cheeses. The nature of the coagulant appeared to be essential during the first stage of proteolysis as expected, whereas the contribution of those bacteria to the pools of total free AA and organic acids was crucial afterward. This was especially so in terms of the differences observed in the metabolisms of lactic acid (in the case of Lactococcus spp.) as well as acetic and citric acids (in the case of Lactobacillus spp.). 3amodel food systems 3acheese milk 3arennet substitutes 3aLactococcus lactis subsp. lactis 3aLactobacillus brevis 3atraditional technology 3afood analysis 3aorganic acids and salts 3alactic acid bacteria 3arennet 3aproteolysis 3aLactobacillus plantarum 3acheeses 3afood matrix 3afood composition 3aewe milk 3agoat milk 3acheese starters 2aAcetic Acidxmetabolism 2aAnimals 2aCattle 2aCheesexmicrobiology 2aCitric Acidxmetabolism 2aCoagulantsxpharmacology 2aFermentation 2aFood Handlingxmethods 2aFood Microbiology 2aGoats 2aLactic Acidxmetabolism 2aLevilactobacillus brevisxmetabolism. 2aLactobacillus plantarumxmetabolism 2aLactococcus lactisxmetabolism 2aMilk 2aSheep 3aPortugal 0aPortugal 0acheesemaking 0aadventitious lactic acid bacteria1 aNeto, D.M.1 aCapucho, J.C.1 aGiao, M.S.1 aGomes, A.M.P.1 aMalcata, F.X.0 tJournal of dairy science.g2010 Apr., v. 93, no. 4 p.1335-1344x0022-03027nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3168/jds.2009-22943Available from publisher's Web site  a20100613b20100703c00000000  aINDd3CTe2010/05/20  aOther US 7aarticle04104naa a2200805 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003100111040001800142072001700160072001700177072001700194100001800211245007800229300001800307500001500325520183100340650001802171650002402189650001602213650002102229650003402250650001702284650001202301650001702313650002002330650001002350650001902360650002102379650001402400650001202414650002402426650001002450650002702460650004602487650004902533650002002582650001102602650002702613650002302640650002102663650003202684650002402716650002102740650002402761650002002785650001002805650003102815650001002846650001702856653002002873653002302893700002002916700001602936700001602952700001302968700001502981700001502996700001503011700001503026773008403041852000903125856008103134930003303215945002503248946001303273655001203286IND4435342020221121135501.0100413e201004  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443534202DNAL7 a203384142pmid7 a10.3168/jds.2009-25422doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Pasteurized bovine milk (3.9% fat) was packed in 2 different atmospheres (air and N2) and exposed to light for 20h at 4°C under 8 transparent filters with different light transmission properties. The following transparent, noncolored, and colored filters based on polyethylene terephthalate (PET) were used: noncolored (PET), noncolored with 2 different UV-block regions, yellow, green, amber, orange, and red. Control samples were stored in darkness and in a carton. Sensory evaluation showed off flavors significantly increased in milk stored under all filters compared with the control samples. Variation in atmosphere resulted in significant differences in formation of rancid flavor in milk stored under different filters. Milk samples stored in N2 underwent the most sensory deterioration under orange and red filters, whereas milk samples stored in air were most deteriorated under noncolored filters. According to the oxidation compounds measured by gas chromatography, milk samples stored under noncolored and orange filters were highly oxidized, whereas red, green, and amber filters offered better protection against photooxidation. Fluorescence spectroscopy was used to examine the degradation of photosensitizers (riboflavin, protoporphyrin, and chlorophyllic compounds) in the milk samples. Degradation of protoporphyrin and chlorophyllic compounds in N2 correlated well with sensory properties related to photooxidation (R2=0.75–0.95). The study indicates that protoporphyrin and chlorophyllic compounds were effective photosensitizers in milk. To avoid photooxidation in milk, it is therefore important to protect it against light from the UV spectrum as well as light from the entire visible region. 3amilk analysis 3apackaging materials 3aoff flavors 3amilk composition 3amodified atmosphere packaging 3afood storage 3afilters 3amilk quality 3astorage quality 3acolor 3aphotooxidation 3apasteurized milk 3aoff odors 2aAnimals 2aChromatography, Gas 2aColor 2aFood Handlingxmethods 2aFood Packagingxinstrumentationxmethods. 2aFood Preservationxinstrumentationxmethods. 2aFood Technology 2aHumans 2aLightxadverse effects 2aLipid Peroxidation 2aLipidsxanalysis 2aMilkxchemistryxstandards. 2aOxidation-Reduction 2aOxygenxanalysis 2aChemical Phenomena. 2aQuality Control 2aSmell 2aSpectrometry, Fluorescence 2aTaste 2aTime Factors 0acolored filters 0asensory properties1 aPettersen, M.K.1 aRukke, E.O.1 aMeier, M.A.1 aVogt, G.1 aDahl, A.V.1 aSkaret, J.1 aKeller, D.1 aWold, J.P.0 tJournal of dairy science.g2010 Apr., v. 93, no. 4 p.1372-1382x0022-03027nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3168/jds.2009-25423Available from publisher's Web site  a20100613b20100703c00000000  aINDd3CTe2010/05/20  aOther US 7aarticle04016naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003100111040001800142072001700160072001700177072001700194100001800211245011800229300001800347500001500365520225000380650002802630650002302658650002602681650002502707650001402732650001402746650002202760650002502782650001402807650001702821650001402838650001802852650001202870650002202882650001802904650002502922650002802947650002302975650001102998650002603009650000903035650002603044650002403070653002403094653002303118700001603141773008403157852000903241856008103250930003303331945002503364946001303389655001203402IND4435341220221121101931.0100413e201004  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443534122DNAL7 a203384092pmid7 a10.3168/jds.2009-20712doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aHackman, T.J.10aInvited review: Ruminant ecology and evolution: Perspectives useful to ruminant livestock research and production  ap. 1320-1334.  a2019-12-04  aThe article reviews ruminant ecology and evolution and shows insights they offer into livestock research. The first ruminants evolved about 50million years ago and were small (<5kg) forest-dwelling omnivores. Today there are almost 200 living ruminant species in 6 families. Wild ruminants number about 75million, range from about 2 to more than 800kg, and generally prefer at least some browse in their diets. Nine species have been domesticated within the last 10,000 yr. Their combined population currently numbers 3.6 billion. In contrast to wild ruminants, domestic species naturally prefer at least some grass in their diets, are of large body weight (BW; roughly from 35 to 800kg), and, excepting reindeer, belong to one family (Bovidae). Wild ruminants thus have a comparatively rich ecological diversity and long evolutionary history. Studying them gives a broad perspective that can augment and challenge the status quo of ruminant research and production. Allometric equations, often used in ecology, relate BW to physiological measurements from several species (typically both wild and domestic). They are chiefly used to predict or explain values of physiological parameters from BW alone. Results of one such equation suggest that artificial selection has increased peak milk energy yield by 250% over its natural level. Voluntary feed intake is proportional to BW0.9 across wild and domestic ruminant species. This proportionality suggests that physical and metabolic factors regulate intake simultaneously, not mutually exclusively as often presumed. Studying the omasum in wild species suggests it functions primarily in particle separation and retention and only secondarily in absorption and other roles. Studies on the African Serengeti show that multiple species, when grazed together, feed such that they use grasslands more completely. They support the use of mixed-species grazing systems in production agriculture. When under metabolic stress, wild species will not rebreed, but rather will extend lactation (to nourish their current offspring). This bolsters the suggestion that lactation length be extended in dairy operations. Cooperation between animal scientists and ecologists could generate more valuable insight. 3ainterspecific variation 3aruminant nutrition 3aagricultural research 3alivestock production 3aevolution 3alactation 3amicrobial ecology 3arumen microorganisms 3alivestock 3awild animals 3aruminants 3amixed grazing 2aAnimals 2aAnimals, Domestic 2aAnimals, Wild 2aBiological Evolution 2aBody Weightxphysiology 2aCattlexphysiology 2aFemale 2aLactationxphysiology 2aMale 2aRuminantsxphysiology 2aSpecies Specificity 0aspecies differences 0aliterature reviews1 aSpain, J.N.0 tJournal of dairy science.g2010 Apr., v. 93, no. 4 p.1320-1334x0022-03027nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3168/jds.2009-20713Available from publisher's Web site  a20100613b20100703c00000000  aINDd3CTe2010/05/20  aOther US 7aarticle01009naa a2200289 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100001400115245007300129300001400202500001500216520021600231650002000447650001900467653002700486653001700513653001900530653002000549773007700569852000900646939003300655945000800688946001100696655001200707991615706480742620221121072401.0820727e197902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aAGE829210672DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee, W.F.10aSome alternatives to conventional farm mortgage loan repayment plans  ap. 12-20.  a2019-12-05  aExtract: This paper suggests four alternatives to the fixed interest rate, level payment farm mortgage: flexible repayment mortgages, graduated mortgages, variable interest rate mortgages, and reverse mortgages. 3afarm management 3amicroeconomics 0aagricultural economics 0aAlternatives 0aFarm mortgages 0aDebt management0 tCanadian farm economics.g1979 , v. 14, no. 1-2 p.12-20x0008-35187nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19820727c00000000  aAGE  aNon-US 7aarticle02585naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002400152245007400176300001800250520125500268650002801523650002501551650001501576650002001591650002201611650001101633650001301644650002201657650002101679653001401700653001601714653002101730653002501751700001701776700001801793700002401811700002201835700002401857773011301881852000901994856009202003930003302095946001102128655001202139IND4427017920221121072340.0091011e200911  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442701792DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1742-4658.2009.07354.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZajicek, Richard S.10ad₁ haem biogenesis - assessing the roles of three nir gene products  ap. 6399-6411.  aThe synthesis of the modified tetrapyrrole known as d₁ haem requires several dedicated proteins which are coded for by a set of genes that are often found adjacent to the structural gene, nirS, for cytochrome cd₁ nitrite reductase. NirE, the product of the first gene in the nir biogenesis operon, was anticipated to catalyse the conversion of uroporphyrinogen III into precorrin-2; this was confirmed, but it was shown that this enzyme is less sensitive to product inhibition than similar enzymes that function in other biosynthetic pathways. Sequence analysis suggesting that one of these proteins, NirN, is a c-type cytochrome, and has similarity to the part of cytochrome cd₁ that binds d₁, was validated by recombinant production and characterization of NirN. A NirN-d₁ haem complex was demonstrated to release the cofactor to a semi-apo form of cytochrome cd₁ from which d₁ was extracted, suggesting a role for NirN in the assembly of cytochrome cd₁ (NirS). However, inactivation of nirN surprisingly led to only a marginal attenuation of growth of Paracoccus pantotrophus under anaerobic denitrifying conditions. As predicted, NirC is a c-type cytochrome; it was shown in vitro to be an electron donor to the NirN-d₁ complex. 3aParacoccus pantotrophus 3abiochemical pathways 3abiogenesis 3adenitrification 3anitrite reductase 3aoperon 3aproteins 3asequence analysis 3astructural genes 0ad₁ haem 0aprecorrin-2 0asirohydrochlorin 0auroporphyrinogen III1 aBali, Shilpa1 aArnold, Simon1 aBrindley, Amanda A.1 aWarren, Martin J.1 aFerguson, Stuart J.0 tFEBS journal.g2009 Nov., v. 276, no. 21 p.6399-6411dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx1742-464X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1742-4658.2009.07354.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20091012b20091106c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02902naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100001700171245007600188300001400264520123700278650001001515650001601525650002301541650004001564650001201604650001601616650001401632650001601646650002701662650001101689650000901700650003801709650003401747650005401781650002301835650003701858650003201895650003001927650001701957650003801974653002802012653003902040700002002079700002402099773010402123852000902227856009202236930003302328946001102361655001202372IND4429823120221121050119.0091211e201001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442982312DNAL7 a200559192pmid7 a10.1111/j.1365-2818.2009.03302.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSTÄDLER, B.10aTime-lapse imaging of In Vitro myogenesis using atomic force microscopy  ap. 63-69.  aMyoblast therapy relies on the integration of skeletal muscle stem cells into distinct muscular compartments for the prevention of clinical conditions such as heart failure, or bladder dysfunction. Understanding the fundamentals of myogenesis is hence crucial for the success of these potential medical therapies. In this report, we followed the rearrangement of the surface membrane structure and the actin cytoskeletal organization in C2C12 myoblasts at different stages of myogenesis using atomic force microscopy (AFM) and confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM). AFM imaging of living myoblasts undergoing fusion unveiled that within minutes of making cell-cell contact, membrane tubules appear that unite the myoblasts and increase in girth as fusion proceeds. CLSM identified these membrane tubules as built on scaffolds of actin filaments that nucleate at points of contact between fusing myoblasts. In contrast, similarly behaving membrane tubules are absent during cytokinesis. The results from our study in combination with recent findings in literature further expand the understanding of the biochemical and membrane structural rearrangements involved in the two fundamental cellular processes of division and fusion. 3aactin 3acell fusion 3amuscle development 2aActinsxphysiologyxultrastructure. 2aAnimals 2aCell Fusion 2aCell Line 2aCytokinesis 2aHeart Failurextherapy 2aHumans 2aMice 2aMicroscopy, Atomic Forcexmethods 2aMicroscopy, Confocalxmethods 2aMicrotubule Proteinsxphysiologyxultrastructure. 2aMuscle Development 2aMyoblastsxcytologyxphysiology. 2aSensitivity and Specificity 2aStem Cell Transplantation 2aTime Factors 2aUrinary Bladder Diseasesxtherapy 0aAtomic force microscopy 0aconfocal laser scanning microscopy1 aBLÄTTLER, T.M.1 aFRANCO-OBREGÓN, A.0 tJournal of microscopy.g2010 Jan., v. 237, no. 1 p.63-69dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0022-27207nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2818.2009.03302.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20091211b20100101c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03297naa a2200625 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002000164245009300184300001500277520149600292650002901788650001201817650001301829650001101842650001101853650002001864650000901884650000901893650001401902650001101916650001601927650001101943650001801954650002301972650001801995650000902013650002302022650002102045650002902066650001902095650001902114650002402133650002202157650002902179650004102208650001902249651001202268651001202280653002302292653001502315700001702330700002002347700002102367773013302388852000902521856008502530930003302615946001102648655001202659IND4428297220221121034950.0091106e200912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442829722DNAL7 a189982252pmid7 a10.1007/s10661-008-0615-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDragun, Zrinka 10aPreliminary assessment of total dissolved trace metal concentrations in Sava River water  ap. 99-110.  aThis study provides the preliminary data set for total dissolved trace metal concentrations in the surface water of the Sava River in Croatia and the assessment of Sava River water quality status. The highest levels of total dissolved metals were observed for Fe, Mn, and Zn (12.6 ± 7.8 μg L ⁻ ¹, 3.44 ± 3.95 μg L ⁻ ¹, and 2.27 ± 1.53 μg L ⁻ ¹, respectively), the intermediate concentrations for Ni, Cu, and Cr (0.59 ± 0.14 μg L ⁻ ¹, 0.54 ± 0.14 μg L ⁻ ¹, and 0.32 ± 0.06 μg L ⁻ ¹, respectively), and the lowest levels for Co, Pb, and Cd (0.064 ± 0.022 μg L ⁻ ¹, 0.055 ± 0.051 μg L ⁻ ¹, and 0.011 ± 0.004 μg L ⁻ ¹, respectively). The results refer to the grab water samples taken at five sites in the period from March to June, 2006. For four trace metals (Mn, Pb, Zn, and Fe), the high temporal variability within one season was observed. It can present a problem for reliable evaluation of total dissolved concentrations of these metals in the river water, if the assessment is based on the occasional grab water sampling. The comparison of results obtained in this study with previously reported data for several unpolluted rivers indicated that Sava River water reflects a certain anthropogenic impact. However, according to the levels proposed by European regulations, it still can be classified as water containing total dissolved trace metals in concentrations not significantly above the natural level. 3aanthropogenic activities 3acadmium 3achromium 3acobalt 3acopper 3adata collection 3airon 3alead 3amanganese 3anickel 3ariver water 3arivers 3asurface water 3atemporal variation 3awater quality 3azinc 2aChromiumxanalysis 2aCopperxanalysis 2aEnvironmental Monitoring 2aIronxanalysis 2aLeadxanalysis 2aManganesexanalysis 2aRiversxchemistry 2aTrace Elementsxanalysis 2aWater Pollutants, Chemicalxanalysis 2aZincxanalysis 3aCroatia 0aCroatia 0aDissolved fraction 0aSava River1 aRoje, Vibor 1 aMikac, Nevenka 1 aRaspor, Biserka 0 tEnvironmental monitoring and assessment.g2009 Dec., v. 159, no. 1-4 p.99-110dDordrecht : Springer Netherlandsx0167-63697nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-008-0615-93Available from publisher's Web site  a20091106b20091204c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03141naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024004200133040001800175100001800193245009200211300001600303520139500319650001301714650002001727650002601747650001201773650002701785650003601812650003201848650004601880650002301926650002701949650004701976650002802023650000902051650000902060650002402069650002802093650000902121650001702130653001302147653001202160653000802172700001702180700001802197700001902215700001602234700001702250700001702267773013402284852000902418856009202427930003302519946001102552655001202563IND4420118220221121024657.0090508e200906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442011822DNAL7 a194386002pmid7 aPMC26919762pmcid7 a10.1111/j.1365-2249.2009.03919.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAnadón, A.M.14aThe Anisakis simplex Ani s 7 major allergen as an indicator of true Anisakis infections  ap. 471-478.  aAni s 7 is currently the most important excretory/secretory (ES) Anisakis simplex allergen, as it is the only one recognized by 100% of infected patients. The allergenicity of this molecule is due mainly to the presence of a novel CX₁₇₋₂₅CX₉₋₂₂CX₈CX₆ tandem repeat motif not seen in any previously reported protein. In this study we used this allergen as a model to investigate how ES allergens are recognized during Anisakis infections, and the usefulness of a recombinant fragment of Ani s 7 allergen (t-Ani s 7) as a marker of true Anisakis infections. The possible antigenic relationship between native Ani s 7 (nAni s 7) from Anisakis and Pseudoterranova decipens antigens was also investigated. Our results demonstrate that nAni s 7 is secreted and recognized by the immune system of rats only when the larvae are alive (i.e. during the acute phase of infection), and that this molecule is not present in, or is antigenically different from, Pseudoterranova allergens. The t-Ani s 7 polypeptide is a useful target for differentiating immunoglobulin E antibodies induced by true Anisakis infections from those induced by other antigens that may cross-react with Anisakis allergens, including P. decipiens. The results also support the hypothesis that the Ani s 7 major allergen does not participate in maintaining the antigenic stimulus during chronic infections. 3aAnisakis 3aPseudoterranova 2aAllergensximmunology 2aAnimals 2aAnisakiasisxdiagnosis 2aAnisakisxgeneticsximmunology. 2aAntibodies, Helminthxblood 2aAntigens, Helminthxgeneticsximmunology. 2aBiomarkersxblood. 2aDisease Models, Animal 2aEnzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assayxmethods 2aImmunoglobulin Exblood 2aMale 2aMice 2aMice, Inbred BALB C 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aRats 2aRats, Wistar 0aallergen 0aAni s 7 0aIgE1 aRomarís, F.1 aEscalante, M.1 aRodríguez, E.1 aGárate, T.1 aCuéllar, C.1 aUbeira, F.M.0 tClinical and experimental immunology.g2009 June, v. 156, no. 3 p.471-478dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0009-91047nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2249.2009.03919.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20090508b20090608c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle04189naa a2200637 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003100111040001800142072001700160072001700177100001800194245009700212300001800309520215200327650002002479650002102499650001602520650002602536650002602562650002302588650001702611650002002628650002402648650004202672650001902714650001202733650002102745650003602766650001102802650005702813650003402870650005002904650002402954650001102978650002402989650001203013650003103025650003603056650006003092650005803152650001503210650001703225651001403242700001803256700002003274773008403294852000903378856008103387930003303468945002503501946001303526655001203539IND4435348320221121024653.0100413e201004  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443534832DNAL7 a203384412pmid7 a10.3168/jds.2009-26642doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aCollins, M.T.10aSuccessful control of Johne's disease in nine dairy herds: Results of a six-year field trial  ap. 1638-1643.  aThe objective was to evaluate if a standardized Johne's disease control program significantly reduced the prevalence of cattle infected with Mycobacterium avium ssp. paratuberculosis in dairy herds with a moderate to high initial infection prevalence of >or=10% ELISA-positive adult cattle. Nine Wisconsin dairy herds of diverse sizes and management styles completed the 6-yr study. The control program involved changes to heifer rearing practices in combination with a routine testing program. For heifers, the program specifically required 1) segregated maternity pens for ELISA-positive and ELISA-negative cattle; 2) removal of calves from the maternity pen in <2h; 3) use of colostrum only from individual ELISA-negative cows (no colostrum pooling); 4) hygienic collection of colostrum; 5) feeding of pasteurized milk as milk replacer or on-farm pasteurized milk until weaning; and 6) minimizing contact with manure from the adult cattle until weaning. The testing program was designed to detect the most infectious cattle by using a commercial ELISA once on every adult during each lactation. Producers were required to cull cows with strong-positive ELISA results before the next calving and to label cows with low- to medium-level ELISA results and manage them to limit infection transmission. Outcomes were measured by comparing the apparent prevalence based on ELISA or fecal culture in the whole herd and in first-lactation cohorts at 2 time points: before implementation of the control program and at the end of the trial. The combined results from the 9 herds showed a significant reduction in ELISA-positive cows, from 11.6% at the start of the trial to 5.6% at conclusion of the trial. The apparent prevalence decline among first-lactation cows was greater and was evident by ELISA (10.4 vs. 3.0%) and by fecal culture (17.0 vs. 9.5%). Although variations among farms were observed, the collective results demonstrated that bovine paratuberculosis can be controlled in dairy herds through effective heifer husbandry practices in combination with diagnostic testing to identify, for culling or management, cows most likely infectious. 3adisease control 3aparatuberculosis 3adairy herds 3adairy herd management 3afield experimentation 3adisease prevalence 3adairy cattle 3acattle diseases 3aMycobacterium avium 2aAnimal Husbandryxmethodsxstandards. 2aAnimal Welfare 2aAnimals 2aAnimals, Newborn 2aAntibodies, Bacterialxanalysis 2aCattle 2aCattle Diseasesxepidemiologyxprevention & control. 2aDairyingxmethodsxstandards. 2aEnzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assayxveterinary 2aFecesxmicrobiology 2aFemale 2aGuideline Adherence 2aHygiene 2aMass Screeningxveterinary 2aMilkximmunologyxmicrobiology. 2aMycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosisximmunology 2aParatuberculosisxepidemiologyxprevention & control. 2aPrevalence 2aRisk Factors 3aWisconsin1 aEggleston, V.1 aManning, E.J.B.0 tJournal of dairy science.g2010 Apr., v. 93, no. 4 p.1638-1643x0022-03027nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3168/jds.2009-26643Available from publisher's Web site  a20100613b20100703c00000000  aINDd3CTe2010/05/20  aOther US 7aarticle03027naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004900094040001800143100001800161245009400179300001600273500000900289520173600298592002802034650001602062650002202078650002102100650001102121650002002132650001102152650002102163650001302184650002202197650001802219650001502237650001102252650002002263650001202283650001902295651001202314700001502326773014702341856009602488852000902584655001202593IND60668450220221119162818.0191125e198805  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066845022DNAL7 a10.2136/sssaj1988.03615995005200030013x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHeaney, D.

Nitrogen-15 labeled KNO₃ (96% atom abundance) was applied at the rate of 2.4 kg N ha⁻¹ to fallow and stubble plots in October and incorporated to a depth of 0.13 m. Isotopic analyses of NH₄-N, NO₃-N, and total-N were performed on soil samples taken to a depth 0.60 m in November, January, March, and May. Analysis of November samples indicated apparent denitrification, immobilization, and release of ¹⁵N as NH₄-N occurred in both soils. Losses of NO₃-N occurred simultaneously with additions between November and January in 3 of 4 fallow-stubble/soil combinations. Migration of soil water towards ice lenses in the surface 0.30 m suggested upward movement of NO₃-N took place as the soil froze. Between January and March, NO₃-N levels increased an average of 6.4 mg N kg⁻¹ in the Cryoboralf while recovery of ¹⁵N was unchanged. In the Argialboll, NO₃-N levels remained constant from January to March. Lower recovery of ¹⁵N under fallow indicated that the NO₃-N pool remained active and losses were balanced by gains. In may recovery as NO₃-N accounted for only 1 to 24% of labeled N added in October. Immobilization accounted for 4 to 30%. Trace amounts of ¹⁵N were detectable in the 0.13 to 0.30-m depth, but not in the 0.30 to 0.60-m depth. Overwinter loss of labeled N from 0 to 0.60 m ranged from 55 to 86%. Processes affecting NO₃-N remained active between October and May, including periods during which soils were frozen throughout the 0 to 0.60-m depth.

The fate of SOC entrapped in terrestrial deposits is largely unknown, but there has been speculation that such entrapment could lead to C sequestration, thereby playing a role in global C cycling. It has been hypothesized that the fate of eroded C in these deposits depends on SOC quality (bioavailability) and the environmental conditions at the depositional site. The SOC storage and dynamics were studied in cultivated, forested, and deposited soils at sites with and without subsurface tile-drainage. Microbial biomass carbon (MBC), readily mineralizable C (MinC), and basal soil respiration (BSR) rates were used as SOC quality indicators and were assessed in field-moist soil aggregates of four sizes: 2-3 mm, 1-2 mm, 0.5-1 mm and <0.5 mm. Soil organic carbon inventory (mass of C over the depth sampled) was significantly different (P < 0.01) among the land uses and was in the order: deposit > forest > cropland. It was also significantly (P < 0.1) different between the two deposits, amounting to 14.6 and 17.1 kg C m in the tile-drained and undrained deposits, respectively. Over that same depth, the total SOC pool in the forest soil was 9.5 kg C m. Overall, the various aggregate sizes did not differ significantly in terms of their total SOC content, but the SOC quality indicators (MBC, MinC, and BSR) were generally higher in the larger than in the smaller aggregates. These indices were also higher in the forest and depression sites than in the croplands. The data indicated that cultivation and erosion resulted in depletion of both total and labile SOC, but the labile pools were depleted at rates 1.5 to 3 times faster. Conversely, there was an enrichment in both clay (1.4 to 2 times) and SOC (1.3 to 1.6 times) in the depression areas, indicating removal of fine particle-associated SOC from the cultivated fields and its entrapment in the deposits. However, the levels of labile C (MBC, MinC) in the entrapped materials were 20 to 46% lower than would be anticipated based on their total C contents. These reductions suggest that, compared with the forest and cropland, a relatively greater proportion of the C retained in the deposits is in the slow and passive pools, and that distribution is favorable to sequestration of C in these landscape positions.  aPublisher supplied data 3atile drainage 3awater erosion 3asoil organic matter 3asoil microorganisms 3abiomass 3abiological activity in soil 3aland use 3aagricultural land 3asoil aggregates 3aOhio1 aLal, R.1 aKimble, J.

However, little attention has been paid to assess the toxicity of the effluent in the receiving water. In this study, vertical flow constructed wetlands (VFCWs) were used to treat the heavy metal-containing wastewater. In addition, the toxicity of the effluent towards Chlorella pyrenoidosa and Daphnia magna was evaluated. The results showed that the VFCWs removed nearly 80% of the total nitrogen, nitrate, and Cd²⁺ from the wastewater during a 60 day operation. Acute toxicity assessments demonstrated that incubating the plankton in 10% (v/v) effluent enhanced their growth, but a further increase in the effluent proportion (50% and 100%) exhibited detrimental effects towards the aquatic organisms. The superoxide dismutase (SOD) and peroxidase (POD) activities in C. pyrenoidosa and D. magna peaked but then decreased with the increasing effluent proportion, indicating that incubation in a higher proportion of the effluent could damage the anti-oxidative capabilities of the organisms, which aligned with the enhanced reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels and malondialdehyde (MDA) contents. After 96 h of incubation, the assimilation of Cd²⁺ was most obvious in all the studied effluent gradients in comparison to Cu²⁺ and Pb²⁺. Additionally, the correlation analysis between the plankton growth and heavy metal removal revealed that Cd²⁺ removal clearly benefited the growth of C. pyrenoidosa and D. magna. These results suggest that additional endeavor should be made on the heavy metal removal, to reduce the potential ecological risk of the final discharge.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChlorella pyrenoidosa 3aDaphnia magna 3aacute toxicity 3acadmium 3aconstructed wetlands 3acopper 3aheavy metals 3alead 3amalondialdehyde 3amunicipal wastewater 3anitrates 3aperoxidase 3aplankton 3areactive oxygen species 3asuperoxide dismutase 3asurface water 3atotal nitrogen 3awater pollution 0aConstructed wetland 0aHeavy metal 0aDaphnia magna 0aChlorella pyrenoidosa 0aOxidative response1 aLi, Xiaoting1 aHe, Yixin1 aLi, Hong0 tScience of the total environment.g2020 July 20, v. 727 p.138616-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.1386163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01465naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002400152245007100176300001200247520056000259592002800819650001100847650002100858650001100879650001000890650001100900650001200911650001300923650001800936773010200954856008601056852000901142655001201151IND60630875720221120144446.0190214e201312  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063087572DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cryobiol.2013.09.0372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKuleshova, Ilia.

Twenty-one chemical elements (Al, B, Ba, Ca, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mg, Mn, Mo, Ni, Pb, Se, Si, Sn, Sr, Ti, V and Zn) in hair samples, which were collected from 71 non-pregnant and 236 pregnant women living in the West Ujimqin Banner, central Inner Mongolia, China, were measured, and the environment, dietary habits and ethnic group influence factors associated with the biomarker were analyzed. The results indicated that the average values of the chemical element contents from hair were greatly different compared to those from other areas, especially the Al, Cd, Pb, Ca and Sr contents. There was no significant difference among the three ethnicities for any element except Mn and Ti in non-pregnant women. Compared to non-pregnant women, in the first trimester group, the levels of nine chemical elements (Ba, Cd, Cu, Pb, Se, Si, Sn and Ti) decreased, while the others increased, and the contents of all of the chemical elements decreased in the second trimester group, while in the third trimester, there was a slight increase. Three chemical elements (Cu, Mn and Zn) displayed a synergistic correlation between each other in the third trimester group, which may protect the placenta from some oxidant damage. The high levels of Cd and Pb in hair likely originate from house renovations and traffic pollution. This study provided basic and useful information on the levels of chemical elements in reproductive-age women, and the results of this study are helpful to control the contents and improve the health of pregnant and non-pregnant women.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaluminum 3abarium 3abiomarkers 3aboron 3acadmium 3acalcium 3achromium 3acobalt 3acopper 3adiet 3aeating habits 3airon 3alead 3amagnesium 3amanganese 3amolybdenum 3anationalities and ethnic groups 3anickel 3aoxidants 3aplacenta 3apollution 3apregnant women 3arisk 3aselenium 3asilicon 3astrontium 3atin 3atitanium 3atraffic 3avanadium 3azinc 3aChina 0aChemical element 0aHuman hair 0aInter-element correlations 0aReproductive-age women 0aWest Ujimqin Banner 0aInner Mongolia1 aYuan, Haodong1 aMa, Xiaoling1 aLiu, Ying0 tChemosphere.g2017 Jan., v. 166 p.528-539dElsevier Ltdx0045-65357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2016.09.1263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03311naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245015500168300001300323520203300336592002802369650001802397650002002415650001402435650003502449650001902484650001502503650002302518650002102541650001502562650001402577650000902591650000902600650001002609650001302619651001202632700001802644700002002662773011702682856008102799852000902880655001202889IND60557977320221117191557.0161104e201611  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055797732DNAL7 a10.1007/s12665-016-6216-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAgbalagba, O.

The monitoring of the terrestrial BIR levels was carried out for 2 years (from May 2013 to June 2015) in 21 locations within the city and 21 other major villages/towns in Ughelli North local government area of Delta state. Measured exposure rate in Ughelli metropolis revealed a mean value of 15.20 ± 2.80 µRh⁻¹ (1.28 ± 0.23 mSvy⁻¹), while a mean value of 15.19 ± 2.70 µRh⁻¹ (1.28 ± 0.23 mSvy⁻¹) was obtained in the villages/towns. The estimated mean outdoor absorbed dose rate for the Ughelli metropolis and Ughelli environs is 132.16 ± 24.36 ηGyh⁻¹ and 132.15 ± 23.50 ηGyh⁻¹, respectively. The mean annual effective dose equivalent is 0.16 ± 0.03 mSvy⁻¹) while the mean excess life cancer risk is (0.56 ± 0.11) × 10⁻³ mSvy⁻¹. GIS maps of the study area revealing the BIR distribution and higher radiation levels were recorded in areas/communities where there are industrial activities and oil and gas facilities. The overall results of the measured exposure rates and the estimated radiological indices show that 73.5% of the sampled location exceeded their permissible limits. The mean equivalent dose rate obtained is higher than the safe exposure limit of 1.0 mSvy⁻¹) recommended by UNSCEAR, and the mean radiation exposure levels in the study area is well above the normal background radiation level of 13.00 µRh⁻¹ which shows that the studied area is radiologically contaminated. Though these values obtained may not cause immediate health hazard, there is the likelihood of long-term accumulating health side effects on the residents of some of these locations and communities sampled. Recommendations are made on the possible ways of reducing the impacts on the populace.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorbed dose 3aadverse effects 3aeffluents 3ageographic information systems 3ahealth hazards 3aionization 3aionizing radiation 3alocal government 3amonitoring 3aneoplasms 3aoils 3arisk 3atowns 3avillages 3aNigeria1 aAvwiri, G.

Arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) and ectomycorrhizal (EM) hosts and fungi employ contrasting strategies for N acquisition, which may manifest in differences in soil C and N pools and/or soil C:N. However, cross‐biome comparisons are confounded with climatic and edaphic gradients as well as phylogenetic and functional trait distributions of component plant species. Here, we test emerging hypotheses that soil C, N and C:N are related to the dominance of EM trees within a temperate forest region where AM and EM trees largely coexist but vary in local abundance. To determine the importance of mycorrhizal type on soil C and N, we analysed data from c. 1,000 forest inventory plots in the eastern United States. For each plot, we quantified the dominance of trees with different mycorrhizal associations and accounted for potentially confounding variables including phylogeny (angiosperm or gymnosperm), leaf N, soil clay content and climate. We used hierarchical Bayesian models to determine how these variables explained the patterns of soil C and N in the forest floor and mineral soil layers. Increasing EM dominance was associated with higher C:N across all soil layers. This relationship remained even after accounting for tree phylogeny, leaf N content, soil clay content, temperature and precipitation, which were all important for explaining soil C:N. However, this mycorrhizal pattern of soil C:N was not related to increases in soil C content; rather, increasing EM dominance was associated with reductions in soil N. Synthesis. Our findings are consistent with the proposition that mycorrhizal associations are related to terrestrial ecosystem properties. The mycorrhizal effect on soil C:N may result from differences in how arbuscular mycorrhizal and ectomycorrhizal plants interact with their fungal symbionts, decomposers and organic matter, to sustain differential cycling of C and N. Alternatively, these patterns could arise from differential success of the two mycorrhizal types in contrasting soil conditions; both processes may occur simultaneously, leading to a self‐reinforcing positive feedback.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAngiospermae 3aBayesian theory 3aGymnospermae 3acarbon 3acarbon nitrogen ratio 3acarbon sinks 3aclay fraction 3aclimate 3aectomycorrhizae 3aforest inventory 3aforest litter 3afungi 3ahosts 3aleaves 3amineral soils 3anitrogen 3anitrogen content 3aorganic matter 3aphylogeny 3asoil quality 3asymbionts 3atemperate forests 3atemperature 3aterrestrial ecosystems 3atrees 3avesicular arbuscular mycorrhizae 3aEastern United States1 aMcCormack, M.

Among nine species of the genus Aliarcobacter, Aliarcobacter faecis and Aliarcobacter lanthieri have been identified as emerging pathogens potentially cause health risks to humans and animals. This study was designed to develop/optimize, validate and apply Arcobacteraceae family‐ and two species‐specific (A. faecis and A. lanthieri) loop‐mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assays to rapidly detect and quantify total number of cells in various environmental niches. METHODS AND RESULTS: Three sets of LAMP primers were designed from conserved and variable regions of 16S rRNA (family‐specific) and gyrB (species‐specific) genes. Optimized Arcobacteraceae family‐specific LAMP assay correctly amplified and detected 24 species, whereas species‐specific LAMP assays detected A. faecis and A. lanthieri reference strains as well as 91 pure and mixed culture isolates recovered from aquatic and faecal sources. The specificity of LAMP amplification of A. faecis and A. lanthieri was further confirmed by restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis. Assay sensitivities were tested using variable DNA concentrations extracted from simulated target species cells in an autoclaved agricultural water sample by achieving a minimum detection limit of 10 cells mL⁻¹ (10 fg). Direct DNA‐based quantitative detection, from agricultural surface water, identified A. faecis (17%) and A. lanthieri (1%) at a low frequency compared to family‐level (93%) with the concentration ranging from 2·1 × 10¹ to 2·2 × 10⁵ cells 100 mL⁻¹. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, these three DNA‐based rapid and cost‐effective novel LAMP assays are sensitive and can be completed in less than 40 min. They have potential for on‐site quantitative detection of species of family Arcobacteraceae, A. faecis and A. lanthieri in food, environmental and clinical matrices. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The newly developed LAMP assays are specific, sensitive, accurate with higher reproducibility that have potential to facilitate in a less equipped lab setting and can help in early quantitative detection and rate of prevalence in environmental niches. The assays can be adopted in the diagnostic labs and epidemiological studies.  aPublisher supplied data  aJ‐001609cAgriculture and Agri‐Food Canada  aJ‐000157cAgriculture and Agri‐Food Canada  aJ‐001609cAgriculture and Agri‐Food Canada  aJ‐000157cAgriculture and Agri‐Food Canada 3aArcobacter 3aautoclaving 3acost effectiveness 3adetection limit 3aloop-mediated isothermal amplification 3amicrobiology 3amixed culture 3arestriction fragment length polymorphism 3asurface water1 aBecker, A.1 aCloutier, M.1 aPlötz, M.1 aLapen, D.R.1 aWilkes, G.1 aTopp, E.1 aAbdulmawjood, A.0 tJournal of applied microbiology.g2021 July, v. 131, no. 1 p.288-299dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl54923x1364-50727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jam.149263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04660naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002200094024001900116024003500135040001800170100002000188245013700208300001200345506007600357520272900433592002803162506003703190650002003227650002503247650002803272650001403300650002103314650001103335650001303346650001503359650001903374650002303393650001903416650001003435650002503445650001403470650002803484650002003512650001003532650004303542650001103585650002603596650001903622650001403641650001903655650001503674650005203689650000903741700002603750700002203776700002603798773013103824856008203955852000904037655001204046IND60557977420221207125421.0220927e201612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055797742DNAL7 aPMC50939762pmcid7 a278067062pmid7 a10.1186/s12906-016-1423-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRahman, Nafeesa10aRice callus suspension culture inhibits growth of cell lines of multiple cancer types and induces apoptosis in lung cancer cell line  ap. 427.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Cancer is one of the leading cause of mortality. Even though efficient drugs are being produced to treat cancer, conventional medicines are costly and have adverse effects. As a result, alternative treatments are being tried due to their low cost and little or no adverse effects. Our previous study identified one such alternative in rice callus suspension culture (RCSC) which was more efficient than Taxol® and Etoposide, in reducing the viability of human colon and renal cancer cells in culture with minimal or no effect on a normal cell line. METHODS: In this study, we tested the effect of RCSC by studying the dynamics of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) in lung cancer cell lines (NCI-H460 and A549), breast cancer cell lines (MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7) and colorectal cancer cell lines (SW620 and Caco-2) as well as their normal-prototypes. Complementary analysis for evaluating membrane integrity was performed by estimating LDH release in non-lysed cells and cell viability with WST-1 assay. Fluorescence microscopy with stains targeting nucleus and cell membrane as well as caspase 3/7 and Annexin V assays were performed. Real-time quantitative RT-PCR was performed to evaluate expression of 92 genes associated with molecular mechanisms of cancer in RCSC treated ling cancer cell line, NCI-H460 and its normal prototype, MRC-5. High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) was used to collect RCSC fractions, which were evaluated on NCI-H460 for their anti-cancer activity. RESULTS: Lower dilutions of RCSC showed maximum reduction in total LDH indicating reduced viability in majority of the cancer cell lines tested with minimal or no effect on normal cell lines compared to the control. Complementary analysis based on LDH release in non-lysed cells and WST-1 assay mostly supported total LDH results. RCSC showed the best effect on the lung non-small carcinoma cell line, NCI-H460. Fluorescence microscopy analyses suggested apoptosis as the most likely event in NCI-H460 treated with RCSC. Gene expression analysis identified significant upregulation of cJUN, NF-κB2 and ITGA2B in NCI-H460 which resulted most likely in the arrest of cell cycle progression and induction of apoptotic process. Further, HPLC-derived RCSC fractions were less effective in reducing cell viability than whole RCSC suggesting that a holistic approach of using RCSC is a better approach in inhibiting cancer cell proliferation. CONCLUSIONS: RCSC was found to be an effective anti-cancer agent on cell lines of multiple cancer types with the best effect on lung cancer cell lines. A possible mechanism for the anticancer activity of RCSC is through induction of apoptosis as observed in the lung cancer cell line, NCI-H460.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aadverse effects 3aalternative medicine 3aantineoplastic activity 3aapoptosis 3abreast neoplasms 3acallus 3acaspases 3acell cycle 3acell membranes 3acell proliferation 3acell viability 3acolon 3acolorectal neoplasms 3aetoposide 3afluorescence microscopy 3agene expression 3agenes 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3ahumans 3alactate dehydrogenase 3alung neoplasms 3amortality 3aneoplasm cells 3aprototypes 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3arice1 aDhadi, Surendar Reddy1 aDeshpande, Aparna1 aRamakrishna, Wusirika0 tBMC complementary and alternative medicine.g2016 Dec., v. 16, no. 1 p.427-427dBioMed CentralwJournal:21388x1472-68827nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12906-016-1423-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03248naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002300150245010500173520188100278592002802159650001602187650003602203650002102239650001102260650000902271650002302280650001102303650002902314650002202343650001702365650001102382650001402393650001802407650001702425650002402442653000902466653002302475653000902498653001502507653001702522700002102539700001902560773010502579856008502684852000902769655001202778IND60676134820221120175437.0200210e202001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067613482DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envint.2019.1052502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRavansari, Roozbeh10aPortable X-ray fluorescence for environmental assessment of soils: Not just a point and shoot method  aPortable XRF is a rapid, mobile, high throughput, and potentially cost effective instrumental analytical technique capable of elemental assessment. It is widely used for environmental assessment of soils in a variety of contexts such as agriculture and pollution both in-situ and ex-situ, to varying levels of success. Portable XRF performance for soil analysis is often validated against wet chemistry techniques but a range of factors may give rise to elementally dependent disparities affecting accuracy and precision assessments. These include heterogeneity, analysis times, instrument stability during analyses, protective thin films, incident X-rays, sample thickness, sample width, analyte interferences, detector resolution, power source fluctuations and instrumental drift. Light elements comprising water and organic matter (i.e. carbon, oxygen) also negatively affect measurements due to X-ray scattering and attenuation. The often-overlooked phenomenon of variability in both soil organic matter and water can also affect soil density (e.g. shrink-swell clays) and thus sample critical thickness which in turn affects the effective volume of sample analyzed. Compounding this, for elements having lower characteristic fluorescence energy, effective volumes of analyses are lower and thus measurements may not be representative of the whole sample. Understanding the effects and interplay between determined elemental concentrations and soil organic matter, water, and critical thickness together with the subtlety of theoretical effective volumes of analyses will help analysts mitigate potential problems and assess the applicability, advantages and limitations of PXRF for a given site. We demonstrate that with careful consideration of these factors and a systematic approach to analysis which we summarize and present, PXRF can provide highly accurate results.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-radiation 3aX-ray fluorescence spectroscopy 3aX-ray scattering 3acarbon 3aclay 3acost effectiveness 3aenergy 3aenvironmental assessment 3afilms (materials) 3afluorescence 3aoxygen 3apollution 3asoil analysis 3asoil density 3asoil organic matter 0aPXRF 0aX-ray fluorescence 0aSoil 0aSoil water 0aGeochemistry1 aWilson, Susan C.1 aTighe, Matthew0 tEnvironment international.g2020 Jan., v. 134 p.105250-dElsevier LtdwJournal:6374x0160-41207nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envint.2019.1052503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03170naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001200147245018700159300002000346520158100366592002801947650002301975650001801998650001702016650002302033650001302056650001402069650002102083650001202104650001302116650001002129650002002139650001002159650002302169650001102192650003402203650001402237650000902251650001002260650001402270650002402284650001302308700001602321700001802337700001502355700001302370700001702383773015002400856008102550852000902631655001202640IND60555591720221120084506.0161029e201609  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055559172DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-016-6798-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShi, Lu10aVinegar residue compost as a growth substrate enhances cucumber resistance against the Fusarium wilt pathogen Fusarium oxysporum by regulating physiological and biochemical responses  ap. 18277-18287.  aFusarium wilt caused by the fungus Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. cucumerinum (FOC) is the most severe soil-borne disease attacking cucumber. To assess the positive effects of vinegar residue substrate (VRS) on the growth and incidence of Fusarium wilt on cucumber, we determined the cucumber growth parameters, disease severity, defense-related enzyme and pathogenesis-related (PR) protein activities, and stress-related gene expression levels. In in vitro and pot experiments, we demonstrated the following results: (i) the VRS extract exhibited a higher biocontrol activity than that of peat against FOC, and significantly improved the growth inhibition of FOC, with values of 48.3 %; (ii) in response to a FOC challenge, antioxidant enzymes and the key enzymes of phenylpropanoid metabolic activities, as well as the PR protein activities in the roots of cucumber, were significantly increased. Moreover, the activities of these proteins were higher in VRS than in peat; (iii) the expression levels of stress-related genes (including glu, pal, and ethylene receptor) elicited responses to the pathogens inoculated in cucumber leaves; and (iv) the FOC treatment significantly inhibited the growth of cucumber seedlings. Moreover, all of the growth indices of plants grown in VRS were significantly higher than those grown in peat. These results offer a new strategy to control cucumber Fusarium wilt, by upregulating the activity levels of defense-related enzymes and PR proteins and adjusting gene expression levels. They also provide a theoretical basis for VRS applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFusarium oxysporum 3aFusarium wilt 3aantioxidants 3abiological control 3acomposts 3acucumbers 3adisease severity 3aenzymes 3aethylene 3afungi 3agene expression 3agenes 3agrowth retardation 3aleaves 3apathogenesis-related proteins 3apathogens 3apeat 3aroots 3aseedlings 3asoil-borne diseases 3avinegars1 aDu, Nanshan1 aYuan, Yinghui1 aShu, Sheng1 aSun, Jin1 aGuo, Shirong0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research international.g2016 Sept., v. 23, no. 18 p.18277-18287dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx0944-13447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-016-6798-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02425naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002400094040001800118100001900136245007400155300001600229520147200245592002801717650002001745650001201765650001201777650001401789650001801803650003101821651001501852700002301867700002301890773010501913856007202018852000902090655001202099IND60131449220221119105256.0151127e200412  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013144922DNAL7 a10.1676/04-0582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee, Derek E.,10aGrit-site selection of black brant: particle size or calcium content?  ap. 304-313.  aWe examined selection of grit-ingestion sites by Black Brant (Branta bernicla nigricans) on South Humboldt Bay, California in relation to particle size and calcium content. We hypothesized that Brant site selection was dependent primarily upon calcium content and secondarily upon distribution of substrate particle size. We (1) mapped grit-ingestion sites, (2) ranked their importance by Brant abundance and individual movement probabilities between sites, (3) characterized Brant gizzard grit and compared it with grit available at ingestion sites, and (4) compared calcium content and particle-size distribution between ingestion sites and unused sites, and between primary and secondary ingestion sites. Brant repeatedly congregated at specific, discrete sites during the 2 years of observation. The distribution of gizzard-grit particle size was right-skewed toward larger particles (>0.5 mm) relative to the proportional availability of particle sizes in the substrate. We found no significant differences in calcium content or particle size between sites where grit was ingested and unused sites. Within used sites, the calcium content of substrates at the primary ingestion site was significantly higher than at the secondary ingestion sites, as ranked by Brant abundance and between-site movement probabilities. Our findings from the field corroborate previous laboratory results, and confirm that calcium is a significant ecological factor for this species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBranta bernicla 3acalcium 3agizzard 3aingestion 3aparticle size 3aparticle size distribution 3aCalifornia1 aHAMMAN, MATTHEW G.1 aBlack, Jeffrey M.,0 tWilson bulletin.g2004 Dec., v. 116, no. 4 p.304-313dWilson Ornithological Societyx0043-56437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1676%2F04-0583Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01712naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004900094040001800143100002500161245004600186300001600232500000900248520071700257592002800974650001601002650002401018650002601042650002001068650001501088650002301103650002001126773014701146856009601293852000901389655001201398IND60668450420221119162837.0191125e196405  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066845042DNAL7 a10.2136/sssaj1964.03615995002800030010x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWaldron, Lawrence J.10aSoil Viscoelasticity: Superposition Tests  ap. 323-328.  aepub  aViscoelasticity is a linear deformation theory in which time-dependence of stress-strain ratios conforms to the Boltzmann superposition principle. Three types of superposition tests were made on briquets of Yolo silt loam subjected to torsional deformation. The principle was found to be valid when stress, stress duration, and soil water content were kept below certain limits. Deviation from linear behavior as these limits were exceeded first appeared as non-Newtonian flow rather than as non-Hookean (instantaneous) elastic response. Where the principle applies, there is a structural stability under deformation which makes viscoelasticity promising for relating mechanical behavior to soil-water structure.  aPublisher supplied data 3adeformation 3amathematical theory 3amechanical properties 3asilt loam soils 3asoil water 3asoil water content 3aviscoelasticity0 tSoil Science Society of America journal.g1964 May, v. 28, no. 3 p.323-328dSoil Science Society of AmericawJournal:jnl44580x0361-59957nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2136/sssaj1964.03615995002800030010x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03296naa a2200649 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245006800168300001200236520149800248592002801746650001601774650002301790650001201813650001001825650002001835650002401855650002101879650001401900650001201914650001901926650001201945650001001957650001901967650001601986650002102002650001302023650001402036650001902050650001002069650001702079650001602096650001402112650001302126650004302139650001302182650001302195650000902208650001102217650001202228650001102240650002402251650001202275650001002287700002702297700001802324700002602342700005702368773011702425856008302542852000902625655001202634IND60701706520221123013313.0210731e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070170652DNAL7 a10.1186/s12917-020-02464-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShivanna, Vinay10aPseudocowpox virus infection in an American bison (Bison bison)  ap. 241.  aBACKGROUND: The present report describes a case of pseudocowpox virus (PCPV) infection in a seven-year-old female bison euthanized due to a history of declining condition and sores on the vulva and udder. CASE PRESENTATION: External examination revealed multifocal, raised, keratinized plaques (0.5–2 cm) covering the skin of the ventral surface of the tail, perineum, caudoventral abdomen, udder, both inguinal recesses, and the medial aspects of both thighs. No significant gross lesions were present in the reminder of the tissues examined. Histopathological examination of the affected skin showed moderate epidermal hyperplasia with rete pegs, marked parakeratotic hyperkeratosis with crusts of degenerate neutrophils and cell debris, and few epithelial cells undergoing ballooning degeneration with occasional eosinophilic intracytoplasmic inclusion bodies (3–5 μm Bollinger body). Negative staining electron microscopy from skin revealed typical Parapoxvirus (PPV) particles, which were also confirmed by real-time PCR (Ct =18.6). Metagenomic analysis of the skin samples revealed only poxviruses. The bison parapox B2L envelope gene clustered with other parapox sequences identified from ruminants. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report of PCPV virus infection in an American bison. Identification of novel susceptible hosts of parapox viruses sheds light on the viral evolution and highlights the importance of potential economic impact of this disease to the bison industry.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBison bison 3aPseudocowpox virus 3aabdomen 3abison 3aeconomic impact 3aelectron microscopy 3aepithelial cells 3aevolution 3afemales 3ahistopathology 3ahistory 3ahosts 3ahyperkeratosis 3ahyperplasia 3ainclusion bodies 3aindustry 3ainfection 3akeratinization 3alight 3ametagenomics 3aneutrophils 3aparticles 3aperineum 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3asampling 3astaining 3atail 3athighs 3atissues 3audders 3aveterinary medicine 3aviruses 3avulva1 aCino-Ozuna, A.

Four ring OH-PAHs were detected in 90% of our samples with a mean liver concentration of 1829.2 ± 159.2 ng/g (ww). Total (∑) concentrations of 5/6-membered ring OH-PAHs in liver were smaller [mean of 931.6 ± 104.3 ng/g, (ww)] and detected less frequently (75%) than the 4-ring OH-PAHs. Fish length and liver weight were both negatively correlated to ∑concentrations of 4-ringed OH-PAHs (p < 0.001). Liver somatic index was also negatively correlated to ∑4-OH-PAHs (p < 0.05) but not for ∑5/6-OH-PAHs (p > 0.1). There was a significant positive relationship between DI and 4-ring OH-PAHs (p < 0.05) in liver, suggesting an induction of this enzyme. No such correlation was observed for the 5/6-ring OH-PAHs. Retinyl palmitate (RP) was the only vitamin that could be measured in liver ranging from 0.230 to 26.3 ug/g (ww). No associations between RP and levels of the 4- or 5/6-ringed OH-PAHs were observed. Continued baseline studies are clearly warranted to further understand effects of OH-PAHs on fish health before planned exploration activities begin in this region.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBoreogadus saida 3acorrelation 3afish 3afish health 3aliver 3ametabolites 3amorphometry 3apolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 3aretinyl palmitate 3avitamin A 3aArctic region 3aBeaufort Sea1 aHalldorson, Thor1 aChernomas, Greg1 aBestvater, Lianna1 aDanegerfield, Kirstin1 aWard, Tom1 aPleskach, Kerri1 aStern, Gary1 aAtchison, Sheila1 aMajewski, Andrew1 aReist, James D.1 aPalace, Vince P.0 tEnvironmental Science & Technology.g2014 Oct. 07, v. 48, no. 19 p.11629-11636dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fes502675p3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02619naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100006600139245009900205300001600304500002000320520153300340592002801873596003801901596003301939650001801972650002201990650002202012650000902034700006002043773012002103856007302223852000902296655001202305IND60742142420221116190210.0210623e202107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074214242DNAL7 a10.1111/faf.125532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aD’Alessandro, Simone1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6143-545X10aSifting environmental DNA metabarcoding data sets for rapid reconstruction of marine food webs  ap. 822-833.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aMarine ecosystems are changing rapidly due to ocean warming, overfishing and a raft of other anthropogenic impacts. Such changes are expected to disrupt productivity dynamics and alter marine food webs, with likely negative consequences for ecosystem services. It is, therefore, essential to devise and implement methods that can rapidly and inexpensively monitor changes in the marine food web structure. Unfortunately, conventional methods for surveying marine food webs are typically laborious, expensive and often destructive, resulting in only a small fraction of marine ecosystems being well studied, and an even smaller subset of them being studied through time. Here, we pilot a low‐cost approach to reconstructing trophic networks of marine tropical, temperate and polar regions, using taxonomical inventories arising from published environmental DNA (eDNA) metabarcoding studies, and building trophic links based on primary literature information. Although the trophic webs obtained are a simplified approximation of those constructed with traditional methods, they generate realistic networks that fit with expectations, and allow ecological inference over time scales and costs that are orders of magnitude smaller than that traditionally achieved. We show the potential of a new application of environmental DNA analysis that promises to offer a rapid and scalable approach to gather vital information on ecosystem structure, hence boosting marine monitoring at a time of increasingly rapid environmental changes.  aPublisher supplied data  cPOR FSE Regione Lazio 2014‐2020  cSapienza Università di Roma 3aDNA barcoding 3aaquatic food webs 3aenvironmental DNA 3afish1 aMariani, Stefano1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5329-05530 tFish and fisheries.g2021 July, v. 22, no. 4 p.822-833dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3867077x1467-29607nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/faf.125533Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02503naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100001900166245014000185300001800325520112100343592002801464650002201492650001301514650001001527650001101537650002601548650003201574650001401606650001601620650001401636651001101650653001301661653002101674653001801695653001501713653001901728700002001747700001701767700002501784700002501809773012101834856008101955852000902036655001202045IND60655016320221122030153.0190729e201309  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065501632DNAL7 a237902222pmid7 a10.1017/S00311820130007352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHOLAND, HÅKON10aTemporal and spatial variation in prevalence of the parasite Syngamus trachea in a metapopulation of house sparrows (Passer domesticus)  ap. 1275-1286.  aWhen investigating parasite–host dynamics in wild populations, a fundamental parameter to investigate is prevalence. This quantifies the percentage of individuals infected in the population. Investigating how prevalence changes over time and space can reveal interesting aspects in the parasite–host relationship in natural populations. We investigated the dynamic between a common avian parasite (Syngamus trachea) in a host metapopulation of house sparrows (Passer domesticus) on the coast of Helgeland in northern Norway. We found that parasite prevalence varied in both time and space. In addition, the parasite prevalence was found to be different between demographic groups in the local populations. Our results reveal just how complex the dynamic between a host and its parasite may become in a fragmented landscape. Although temperature may be an important factor, the specific mechanisms causing this complexity are not fully understood, but need to be further examined to understand how parasite–host interactions may affect the ecological and evolutionary dynamics and viability of host populations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPasser domesticus 3aSyngamus 3abirds 3acoasts 3ahabitat fragmentation 3ahost-parasite relationships 3aparasites 3atemperature 3aviability 3aNorway 0aParasite 0aSyngamus trachea 0ahouse sparrow 0aprevalence 0ametapopulation1 aJensen, Henrik,1 aTUFTO, JARLE1 aSæther, Bernt-Erik,1 aRINGSBY, THOR HARALD0 tParasitology.g2013 Sept., v. 140, no. 10 p.1275-1286dCambridge University PresswJournal:jnl45572x1469-81617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S00311820130007353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03204naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001900139245009800158300001800256520168200274592002801956650002201984650001302006650001402019650002802033650001802061650002202079650001302101650001902114650001902133650001902152650003302171650002202204650001602226650002102242650002602263653002102289653002302310653002202333653001202355653001402367700001802381700002202399700001802421700002102439700001702460773012702477856007302604852000902677655001202686IND60527463120221120195106.0160715e20130710xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052746312DNAL7 a10.1021/am401083y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPark, Jung-Jae10aThermally Induced Superhydrophilicity in TiO2 Films Prepared by Supersonic Aerosol Deposition  ap. 6155-6160.  aSuperhydrophilic and superhydrophobic surfaces enable self-cleaning phenomena, either forming a continuous water film or forming droplets that roll off the surface, respectively. TiO₂ films are well-known for their extreme hydrophilicity and photocatalytic characteristics. Here, we describe nanostructured TiO₂ thin films prepared by supersonic aerosol deposition, including a thorough study of the effects of the annealing temperature on the crystal structure, surface morphology, surface roughness, and wetting properties. Powder X-ray diffraction showed that supersonic deposition resulted in fragmentation and amorphization of the micrometer-size anatase (60%)–rutile (40%) precursor powder and that, upon annealing, a substantial fraction of the film (∼30%) crystallized in the highly hydrophilic but metastable brookite phase. The film morphology was also somewhat modified after annealing. Scanning electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy revealed rough granular films with high surface roughness. The as-deposited TiO₂ films were moderately hydrophilic with a water contact angle (θ) of ∼45°, whereas TiO₂ films annealed at 500 °C became superhydrophilic (θ ∼ 0°) without UV illumination. This thermally induced superhydrophilicity of the TiO₂ films can be explained on the basis of the combined effects of the change in the crystal structure, surface microstructure, and surface roughness. Supersonic aerosol deposition followed by annealing is uniquely able to produce these nanostructured films containing a mixture of all three TiO₂ phases (anatase, rutile, and brookite) and exhibiting superhydrophilicity without UV illumination.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3aaerosols 3aannealing 3aatomic force microscopy 3acontact angle 3acrystal structure 3adroplets 3ahydrophilicity 3ahydrophobicity 3amicrostructure 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asurface roughness 3atemperature 3atitanium dioxide 3aultraviolet radiation 0asuperhydrophilic 0aaerosol deposition 0asurface roughness 0awetting 0aannealing1 aKim, Do-yeon,1 aLatthe, Sanjay S.1 aLee, Jong-Gun1 aSwihart, Mark T.1 aYoon, Sam S.0 tACS applied materials .g2013 July 10, v. 5, no. 13 p.6155-6160dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/am401083y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02413naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245005700164300001600221520136200237592002801599650001501627650001901642650001001661650001301671650001501684650001101699650003301710650001801743650001701761650003701778700002101815700001801836773010701854856008101961852000902042655001202051IND60537269620221120032459.0160807e201608  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053726962DNAL7 a10.1007/s00606-016-1303-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSong, Jun-Ho10aPollen morphology of the tribe Sorbarieae (Rosaceae)  ap. 853-869.  aThe pollen morphology of the tribe Sorbarieae (Adenostoma, Chamaebatiaria, Sorbaria, and Spiraeanthus) and two related genera Gillenia and Lyonothamnus was investigated by light, scanning electron, and transmission electron microscopy. Sorbarieae pollen was monad, tri-colporate, small to medium in size (P = 10.2–40.0 μm, E = 10.8–32.4 μm), and oblate to prolate in shape (P/E = 0.74–1.88). The sexine ornamentation was striate, but four different types could be divided: striate-psilate, striate-plicate, striate-microechinate, and striate-perforate. The pollen wall stratification typically consisted of unbranched columellae and a continuous endexine. As an additional palynological characteristic, orbicules (small sporopollenin granules) were observed in all taxa and thus a possible synapomorphic character of Sorbarieae as a whole. The pollen characteristics are useful to recognize certain taxa. Gillenia is the only genus with both a pore flap on the aperture and the perforated sexine. Lyonothamnus has a significantly thick exine and relatively larger pollen grains, which is compared to that of Sorbarieae. Some quantitative characteristics (e.g., pollen and colpus size, exine thickness, and ridge width of striae) identified using principal components analysis (PCA) may have diagnostic importance among the taxa in the tribe.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAdenostoma 3aChamaebatiaria 3aexine 3agranules 3apalynology 3apollen 3aprincipal component analysis 3asporopollenin 3asynapomorphy 3atransmission electron microscopy1 aMoon, Hye-Kyoung1 aHong, Suk-Pyo0 tPlant systematics and evolution.g2016 Aug., v. 302, no. 7 p.853-869dSpringer Viennax0378-26977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00606-016-1303-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04148naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100006100145245013100206300001600337500002000353520241200373592002802785650002202813650001902835650001902854650001302873650001202886650001602898650002202914650001202936650000902948650002802957650002402985650001503009650001003024650001403034650001503048650002103063650001803084650001603102650001303118650001003131650001103141650001703152650002503169650002203194651002603216651001803242700002303260700002403283700002203307700002103329773011903350856008003469852000903549655001203558IND60589298520221122064037.0180619e201803  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058929852DNAL7 a10.1111/1365-2745.128372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLazarus, Brynne E.1http://orcid.org/0000-0002-6352-486X10aGrowth strategies and threshold responses to water deficit modulate effects of warming on tree seedlings from forest to alpine  ap. 571-585.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aPredictions of upslope range shifts for tree species with warming are based on assumptions of moisture stress at lower elevation limits and low‐temperature stress at high‐elevation limits. However, recent studies have shown that warming can reduce tree seedling establishment across the entire gradient from subalpine forest to alpine via moisture limitation. Warming effects also vary with species, potentially resulting in community shifts in high‐elevation forests. We examined the growth and physiology underlying effects of warming on seedling demographic patterns. We evaluated dry mass (DM), root length, allocation above‐ and below‐ground, and relative growth rate (RGR) of whole seedlings, and their ability to avoid or endure water stress via water‐use efficiency and resisting turgor loss, for Pinus flexilis, Picea engelmannii and Pinus contorta seeded below, at and above tree line in experimentally warmed, watered and control plots in the Rocky Mountains, USA. We expected that growth and allocation responses to warming would relate to moisture status and that variation in drought tolerance traits would explain species differences in survival rates. Across treatments and elevations, seedlings of all species had weak turgor‐loss resistance, and growth was marginal with negative RGR in the first growth phase (−0.01 to −0.04 g g⁻¹ day⁻¹). Growth was correlated with soil moisture, particularly in the relatively small‐seeded P. contorta and P. engelmannii. Pinus flexilis, known to have the highest survivorship, attained the greatest DM and longest root but was also the slowest growing and most water‐use efficient. This was likely due to its greater reliance on seed reserves. Seedlings developed 15% less total DM, 25% less root DM and 11% shorter roots in heated compared with unheated plots. Higher temperatures slightly increased DM, root length and RGR where soils were wettest, but more strongly decreased these variables under drier conditions. Synthesis. The surprising heat inhibition of tree seedling establishment at the cold edge of forests appears to have a physiological basis: newly germinated seedlings have poor moisture stress tolerance, which appears related to marginal initial growth and heavy reliance on seed reserves. Variation in these attributes among tree species at tree line helps explain their different climate responses.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPicea engelmannii 3aPinus contorta 3aPinus flexilis 3aaltitude 3aclimate 3acold stress 3adrought tolerance 3aforests 3aheat 3ainterspecific variation 3aplant establishment 3aprediction 3aroots 3aseedlings 3asoil water 3astress tolerance 3asurvival rate 3atemperature 3atreeline 3atrees 3aturgor 3awater stress 3awater use efficiency 3awater utilization 3aRocky Mountain region 3aUnited States1 aCastanha, Cristina1 aGermino, Matthew J.1 aKueppers, Lara M.1 aMoyes, Andrew B.0 tjournal of ecology.g2018 Mar., v. 106, no. 2 p.571-585dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl44660x0022-04777nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1365-2745.128373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02367naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001800139245018000157300002000337520122700357592002801584650002501612650001201637650001301649650001001662650004601672650003201718650001501750650001301765650001401778700001401792700001401806773011301820856007501933852000902008655001202017IND60529884120221119003753.0160720e20141104xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052988412DNAL7 a10.1021/ac503014k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJin, Di-Qiong10aSwan Probe: A Nanoliter-Scale and High-Throughput Sampling Interface for Coupling Electrospray Ionization Mass Spectrometry with Microfluidic Droplet Array and Multiwell Plate  ap. 10796-10803.  aMass spectrometry provides a versatile detection method for high-throughput drug screening because it permits the use of native biological substrates and the direct quantification of unlabeled reaction products. This paper describes the design and application of a Swan-shaped probe for high-throughput and nanoliter-scale analysis of biological samples in both a microfluidic droplet array and a multiwell plate with electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS). The Swan probe is fabricated using a single capillary with quite low cost, and it consists of a U-shaped section with a micrometer-sized hole for sampling and a tapered tip for sample electrospray ionization. Continuous sample introduction was carried out under both sampling modes of push–pull and spontaneous injection by sequentially dipping the probe in the sample solutions and then removing them. High-throughput and reliable ESI-MS analysis was achieved in analyzing 256 droplets within 90 min with a peak height RSD of 12.6% (n = 256). To validate its potential in drug discovery, the present system was applied in the screening of inhibitors of acetylcholinesterase (AchE) and the measurement of the IC₅₀ values of identified inhibitors.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetylcholinesterase 3adipping 3adroplets 3adrugs 3aelectrospray ionization mass spectrometry 3ainhibitory concentration 50 3aionization 3asampling 3ascreening1 aZhu, Ying1 aFang, Qun0 tAnalytical chemistry.g2014 Nov. 04, v. 86, no. 21 p.10796-10803dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-68827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fac503014k3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03118naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100002400188245009500212300001200307506007600319520143900395592002801834506003701862650002101899650003601920650000801956650002901964650001401993650001402007650001102021650002602032650001002058650002302068650003102091650004302122650001502165650001802180650001402198650001202212700001902224700002402243700002102267700003402288700002102322700002202343700002402365773009702389856008102486852000902567655001202576IND60557977620221207125416.0170725e201612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055797762DNAL7 a10.1186/s12917-016-0875-52doi7 aPMC50941452pmcid7 a278067222pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShalaby, Mohamed A.10aRecombinase polymerase amplification assay for rapid detection of lumpy skin disease virus  ap. 244.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Lumpy skin disease virus (LSDV) is a Capripoxvirus infecting cattle and Buffalos. Lumpy skin disease (LSD) leads to significant economic losses due to hide damage, reduction of milk production, mastitis, infertility and mortalities (10 %). Early detection of the virus is crucial to start appropriate outbreak control measures. Veterinarians rely on the presence of the characteristic clinical signs of LSD. Laboratory diagnostics including virus isolation, sequencing and real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) are performed at well-equipped laboratories. In this study, a portable, simple, and rapid recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA) assay for the detection of LSDV-genome for the use on farms was developed. RESULTS: The LSDV RPA assay was performed at 42 °C and detected down to 179 DNA copies/reaction in a maximum of 15 min. Unspecific amplification was observed with neither LSDV-negative samples (n = 12) nor nucleic acid preparations from orf virus, bovine papular stomatitis virus, cowpoxvirus, Peste des petits ruminants and Blue tongue virus (serotypes 1, 6 and 8). The clinical sensitivity of the LSDV RPA assay matched 100 % (n = 22) to real-time PCR results. In addition, the LSDV RPA assay detected sheep and goat poxviruses. CONCLUSION: The LSDV RPA assay is a rapid and sensitive test that could be implemented in field or at quarantine stations for the identification of LSDV infected case.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aBluetongue virus 3aBovine papular stomatitis virus 3aDNA 3aLumpy skin disease virus 3aOrf virus 3abuffaloes 3acattle 3adiagnostic techniques 3afarms 3alumpy skin disease 3apeste des petits ruminants 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3aquarantine 3arapid methods 3aserotypes 3aviruses1 aEl-Deeb, Ayman1 aEl-Tholoth, Mohamed1 aHoffmann, Donata1 aCzerny, C.-P.q(Claus-Peter),1 aHufert, Frank T.1 aWeidmann, Manfred1 aAbd El Wahed, Ahmed0 tBMC veterinary research.g2016 Dec., v. 12, no. 1 p.244-244dBioMed Centralx1746-61487nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12917-016-0875-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02148naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094040001800138100002400156245013000180300001600310500002000326520102800346592002801374650002201402650001301424650001201437650001901449650001201468650001601480650001201496650001401508650001201522650001301534650001001547773010501557856009001662961001301752852000901765655001201774IND60575349420221118200545.0170728e199308  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057534942DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1399-3054.1993.tb01380.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKinraide, Thomas B.10aAluminum enhancement of plant growth in acid rooting media. A case of reciprocal alleviation of toxicity by two toxic cations  ap. 619-625.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe generally rhizotoxic ion Al³⁺ often enhances root growth at low concentrations. The hypothesis that Al³⁺ enhances growth by relieving H⁺ toxicity was tested with wheat seedlings (Triticum aestivum L.). Growth enhancement by Al³⁺ only occurred under acidic conditions that reduced root elongation. Al³⁺ increased cell membrane electrical polarity and stimulated H⁺ extrusion. Previous investigations have shown that Al³⁺ decreases solute leakage at low ₚH and that the alleviation of H⁺ toxicity by cations appears to be a general phenomenon with effectiveness dependent upon charge (C³⁺>C²⁺>Cˡ⁺). Alleviation of one cation toxicity by another toxic cation appears to be reciprocal so that Al³⁺ toxicity is relieved by H⁺. It has been argued previously that this latter phenomenon accounts for the apparent toxicity of ALOH²⁺ and Al(OH)⁺ ₂. Reduction of cell‐surface electrical potential by the ameliorative cation may reduce the cell‐surface activity of the toxic cation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTriticum aestivum 3aaluminum 3acations 3acell membranes 3aprotons 3aroot growth 3arooting 3aseedlings 3asolutes 3atoxicity 3awheat0 tPhysiologia plantarum.g1993 Aug., v. 88, no. 4 p.619-625dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0031-93177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1399-3054.1993.tb01380.x3Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle03298naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003700111040001800148072000900166072000900175100001100184245016000195300001800355500002400373520126200397650001701659650001501676650002801691650003001719650002601749650003001775650003101805650002801836650002401864650003401888650001501922650001401937650002001951650002601971650001201997650001902009650004302028650002702071650003802098650002902136650002002165650001702185653002402202653002902226700001602255700001402271773012402285852000902409856008702418856010802505930003302613945002502646946001302671655001202684IND4383238120221121033816.0060831e200608  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438323812DNAL7 a169376622pmid7 a10.1603/0022-0493-99.4.11122doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF851 0aK5101 aYu, H.10aParasitism of Subterranean Termites (Isoptera: Rhinotermitidae: Termitidae) by Entomopathogenic Nematodes (Rhabditida: Steinernematidae; Heterorhabditidae)  ap. 1112-1119.  aIncludes references  aIn laboratory bioassays, Steinernema riobrave Cabanillas, Poinar and Raulston (355 strain), Steinernema carpocapsae (Weiser) (Mexican 33 strain), Steinernema feltiae (Filipjev) (UK76 strain), and Heterorhabditis bacteriophora Poinar (HP88 strain) were all capable of infecting and killing three termite species, Heterotermes aureus (Snyder), Gnathamitermes perplexus (Banks), and Reticulitermes flavipes (Kollar) in laboratory sand assays.

At 22°C, significant mortality (>= 80%) of worker H. aureus and G. perplexus was caused by S. riobrave, in sand assays, indicating the need for further study. Because of the short assay time (3 d maximum), reproduction of the nematodes in the target host species was not recorded. All nematode species were observed to develop to fourth-stage juveniles, preadult stages, or adults in all termite species with the exception of R. virginicus.

These two complexes were used as the dopants for the fabrication of two-element white phosphorescent devices. Via the introduction of a thin energy-harvesting layer (EHL) to harvest the extra energy and exciton from the emission zone, highly efficient two-element white devices with excellent color stability were created. One of the best devices shows yellow-white color emission with an extremely high external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 21.5% and a current efficiency of 68.8 cd/A. The other device gave a pure white emission with an external quantum efficiency of 19.2% and a current efficiency of 53.2 cd/A. At a high brightness of 1000 cd/m², the EQE still remains as high as 18.9 and 17.2%. With a brightness of 1000–10000 cd/m², the CIE coordinates of these two devices shift by only (0.02, ≤0.01). The white phosphorescent devices with the EHL showed much higher efficiency and better color stability than the one without the EHL.  aPublisher supplied data 3acolor 3aenergy 3aharvesting 3airidium 3aphosphorescence 0aWOLEDs 0aelectroluminance 0aphosphorescent 0alow-efficiency roll-off 0acolor stability1 aLi, Yi-Kai1 aChen, Yu-Han1 aChang, Ching-Chih1 aLiao, Chuang-Yi1 aCheng, Chien-Hong0 tACS Applied Materials & Interfaces.g2013 July 10, v. 5, no. 13 p.6168-6175dAmerican Chemical Societyx1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fam401108m3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04100naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001900142245012400161500001900285520259900304592002802903650001502931650001202946650001702958650001902975650002402994650001703018650002303035650002903058650002903087650001003116650002203126650002303148650002003171650002303191650001103214650001203225650001003237651001603247653001803263653001703281653001503298653001603313653001703329653001703346700002103363773011303384856007603497852000903573655001203582IND60730310620221120182139.0210308e20161128xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073031062DNAL7 a10.3897/BDJ.4.e100592doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTocco, Claudia10aDung beetle (Coleoptera: Scarabaeoidea) assemblages in the western Italian Alps: benchmark data for land use monitoring  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aTraditional agro-pastoral practices are in decline over much of the Alps (MacDonald et al. 2000), leading to shrub and tree encroachment, and this represents one of the main threats for the conservation of alpine biodiversity, as many plant and animal species are dependent on the presence of semi-natural open habitats. However, quantifying this environmental change and assessing its impact on biodiversity may be difficult, especially in the context of sparse historical survey data. The accessibility of contemporary data about local biodiversity surveys in general, and indicator taxa in particular, is an essential consideration for planning future evaluations of conservation status in the Alps and for conservation plans that use ecological indicators to monitor temporal changes in biodiversity. Dung beetles are important ecosystem service providers (Nichols et al. 2008) that have been assessed as a good ecological indicator taxon in several studies (reviewed by Nichols and Gardner 2011), and although the Alps is perhaps one of the best-studied regions in respect of dung beetles, there are still only eight readily-accessible publications. We have augmented and comprehensively reviewed the data from these publications. We first provide data about changes on a temporal scale of seasons in a dung beetle community in the western Italian Alps, an issue that has to be addressed in the local assemblages because it would affect regional biomonitoring and conservation research. This survey of 12 099 individuals belonging to 22 species illustrates a distinct seasonal pattern at a single site. Second, we collate the results of 13 published surveys of the presence of 46 species of dung beetles in 11 valleys in the western Italian Alps in the period from 2005 to 2012, a period of accelerated change in land use that started around 1945 (MacDonald et al. 2000). Because ten of the surveys used baited pitfall traps and four more used manual collection of specimens, the abundance data were not strictly comparable and they were therefore transformed to binary data (presence-or-absence records) with measures of sampling effort. The results illustrate both spatial variation and temporal variation at the scale of years.Because of the importance of dung beetles in agro-pastoral ecosystems and the high sensitivity of montane ecosystems to climate change, these spatially and temporally explicit data sets provide important baseline information about western Italian Alpine dung beetles for investigations of the effects of land use change under ongoing climate change scenarios.  aPublisher supplied data 3aColeoptera 3aanimals 3abiodiversity 3aclimate change 3aconservation status 3adung beetles 3aecosystem services 3aenvironmental indicators 3aenvironmental monitoring 3afeces 3aindicator species 3ainsect communities 3aland use change 3aseasonal variation 3ashrubs 3asurveys 3atrees 3aAlps region 0apitfall traps 0aScarabaeinae 0aAphodiinae 0aGeotrupidae 0aItalian Alps 0aseasonality.1 aVillet, Martin H0 tBiodiversity data journal.g2016 Nov. 28, v. 4 p.e10059-dPensoft PublisherswJournal:21364x1314-28287nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3897/BDJ.4.e100593Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03795naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245010000166520211800266592002802384650001802412650002102430650002802451650002502479650003202504650001302536650002602549650002402575650003102599650001502630650001702645650003102662650001802693650000902711650001902720650002202739650002002761650002502781650001602806650001302822650001202835651001002847653002402857653001902881653002202900700001402922700002102936700001502957700001502972700001602987700001503003773010503018856008503123852000903208655001203217IND60676135320221120175342.0200210e202001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067613532DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envint.2019.1053182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOuyang, Wei10aAirborne bacterial communities and antibiotic resistance gene dynamics in PM2.5 during rainfall  aThe biotoxicity and public health effects of airborne bacteria and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in fine particulate matter (PM₂.₅) are being increasingly recognized. The characteristics of bacterial community composition and ARGs in PM₂.₅ under different rainfall conditions were studied based on the on-site synchronous measurements in downtown Beijing. Marked differences were evident in the bacterial community characteristics of PM₂.₅ before, during, and after rain events (p < 0.05). The rain intensities affected the bacterial community abundance in PM₂.₅ and heavy rain had greater washing effects. The Proteobacteria (phylum level), α-Proteobacteria (class level), Pseudomonadales (order level), Pseudomonadaceae (family level), and Cyanobacteria (genus level) were the dominant bacterial taxa associated with PM₂.₅ in Beijing during rain events. However, the bacteria at each level that displayed the biggest percentage variance was not the dominant type under different rain intensities. The ermB, tetW, and mphE genes were the primary ARGs, with abundances of 18 to 30 copies/m³, which was a relatively smaller value than other observations. Real-time monitoring of the meteorological condition of rain events and physicochemical properties of PM₂.₅ were used to identify the main factors during rainfall. The bacterial community was sensitive to the ionic and metal element components of PM₂.₅ during rainfall. The abundance of ARGs was closely correlated with some groups of the bacterial community, which were also close to the initial value before the rain. Statistical analysis demonstrated that temperature, relative humidity, and duration of rain were the primary meteorological factors for the biological characteristics. The ionic species, rather than metal elements, in PM₂.₅ were the sensitive factors for the bacteria community and ARGs, which varied at the phylum, class, order, family, and genus levels. The observations provide insights for the biological risk assessment in an urban rainfall water and the potential health impact on citizens.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCyanobacteria 3aPseudomonadaceae 3aairborne microorganisms 3aalpha-Proteobacteria 3aantibiotic resistance genes 3abacteria 3abacterial communities 3acommunity structure 3ahealth effects assessments 3amonitoring 3aparticulates 3aphysicochemical properties 3apublic health 3arain 3arain intensity 3arelative humidity 3arisk assessment 3astatistical analysis 3atemperature 3avariance 3awashing 3aChina 0aBacterial community 0aWashing effect 0aDiffuse pollution1 aGao, Bing1 aCheng, Hongguang1 aZhang, Lei1 aWang, Yidi1 aLin, Chunye1 aChen, Jing0 tEnvironment international.g2020 Jan., v. 134 p.105318-dElsevier LtdwJournal:6374x0160-41207nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envint.2019.1053183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02984naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001300139245014800152300001800300520142700318592002801745650001501773650001201788650001301800650001601813650002401829650001501853650001201868650000901880650001601889650006601905650001401971650001501985650001302000650001602013650001902029650001102048650001702059650002302076653002602099653002002125653003402145653001802179653002202197700002102219700001802240773012402258856007502382852000902457655001202466IND60527463420221120195054.0160715e20130710xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052746342DNAL7 a10.1021/am401132s2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNie, Bei10aNanoporous GaN–Ag Composite Materials Prepared by Metal-Assisted Electroless Etching for Direct Laser Desorption-Ionization Mass Spectrometry  ap. 6208-6215.  aThree-dimensional nanoporous gallium nitride(PGaN) produced by metal-assisted electroless etching is chemically embedded with silver nanoparticles via electroless deposition, forming a metallized semiconductor membrane with large surface area and nanoscale metal features. A new application utilizing the unique chemical and morphological features of these composite nanostructures is described here, laser induced desorption-ionization(LDI) of biomolecules(e.g., cholesterol and nucleotides) for direct mass analysis, without use of additional organic matrix. Although PGaN itself is a poor matrix for direct LDI mass spectrometry, the combination of Ag and PGaN greatly improves ion signals relative to PGaN or Ag nanostructure surfaces alone. This behavior is attributed to the combination of strong UV absorption, enhanced surface area, and favorable thermal properties of PGaN. Importantly, Ag-PGaN is shown to facilitate the formation of Ag adduct ions in some cases, for example adenine, where adducts are not observed from either porous anodic aluminum membranes or surfaces presenting Ag nanoparticles in isolation. Nanopore-embedded Ag nanostructures serve a dual role: as cationization agents and to assist thermal desorption under UV laser irradiation. The results reported here suggest that the combination of Ag nanostructures embedded in PGaN has the capacity for high quality matrix-free LDI mass analysis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3aadenine 3aaluminum 3acholesterol 3acomposite materials 3adesorption 3agallium 3aions 3airradiation 3amatrix-assisted laser desorption-ionization mass spectrometry 3ananopores 3ananosilver 3anitrides 3anucleotides 3asemiconductors 3asilver 3asurface area 3athermal properties 0aporous semiconductors 0agallium nitride 0alaser desorption−ionization 0ananoparticles 0amass spectrometry1 aDuan, Barrett

Selective removal of endotoxins is particularly challenging for protein solutions and, to this day, no general method is available. Here, we report that crystals of the purine-derived compound allantoin selectively adsorb endotoxins with picomolar affinity through amide-mediated hydrogen bonding in aqueous solutions. Atom force microscopy and chemical inhibition experiments indicate that endotoxin adsorption is largely independent from hydrophobic and ionic interactions with allantoin crystals and is mediated by hydrogen bonding with amide groups at flat crystal surfaces. The small size (500 nm) and large specific surface area of allantoin crystals results in a very high endotoxin-binding capacity (3 × 10⁷ EU/g) which compares favorably with known endotoxin-binding materials. These results provide a proof-of-concept for hydrogen bond-based molecular recognition processes in aqueous solutions and establish a practical method for removing endotoxins from protein solutions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEuropean Union 3aGram-negative bacteria 3aadsorption 3aallantoin 3aaqueous solutions 3aatomic force microscopy 3acrystals 3aendotoxins 3ahydrogen 3ahydrogen bonding 3ahydrophobicity 3aneutralization 3aresearchers 3asurface area 3atoxicity 0ahydrogen bonding 0aamide 0aendotoxin 0aorganic crystals 0apurine 0aallantoin1 aChing, Tim-Jang1 aChua, Rui-Jing1 aThirumoorthi, Navanita1 aGagnon, Pete0 tACS applied materials .g2013 May 22, v. 5, no. 10 p.4472-4478dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/am401018q3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04051naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001900145245011600164300001600280500002000296520250000316592002802816650002102844650001102865650001902876650001202895650001402907650002002921650001102941650000902952650001702961650001102978650001102989650001603000650002103016650001103037651001303048700005603061700005603117700002003173700001703193700001903210700002403229700002403253700002603277700002203303773011903325856008003444852000903524655001203533IND60589298820221122064157.0180619e201803  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058929882DNAL7 a10.1111/1365-2745.128362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Yu‐Yun10aSpecies‐specific flowering cues among general flowering Shorea species at the Pasoh Research Forest, Malaysia  ap. 586-598.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aIn a unique phenomenon restricted to the ever wet forests of Southeast Asia, hundreds of species from dozens of plant families reproduce synchronously at irregular, multi‐year intervals. The proximate environmental cues that synchronize these general flowering events have not been evaluated systematically because there have been no long‐term, high temporal resolution, species‐level records from the region. We present 13 years of weekly flowering records for five Shorea species as well as daily temperature and rainfall records from the Pasoh Forest Reserve, Peninsular Malaysia. We constructed models to evaluate hypothesized relationships between flowering and cool temperature, drought, and additive and synergistic effects of cool temperature and drought for each species. Model parameters include periods of time for floral cue accumulation and flower development and temperature and/or rainfall thresholds required for floral initiation. Parameters estimated using flowering observations from 2001 to 2011 were used to forecast flowering for 2011–2014. We show that drought and cool temperatures acting synergistically best explain the timing of flowering events for all Shorea species in the section Mutica and forecast the largest general flowering event accurately. Periods estimated for signal accumulation ranged from 54 to 90 days among species. Periods estimated for flowers to develop ranged between 43 and 96 days and closely followed the interspecific sequence of flowering in the Shorea species. Drought and temperature thresholds also varied among species, with Shorea maxwelliana requiring the most severe drought and Shorea leprosula the lowest temperatures. Synthesis. Our results indicate that cool temperatures and low rainfall occurring on seasonal time‐scales of about 2–3 months rather than brief cold snaps or brief droughts best explain general flowering in Shorea species at the Pasoh Forest Reserve. Low rainfall is equally likely in winter (December–February) and summer (July–August) and cool temperatures are most likely in winter at Pasoh, which explains why general flowering events are restricted to spring and fall, with more frequent and stronger flowering in spring. In addition, species‐specific sensitivity to environmental cues suggests that future climate change will have differential impacts on the frequency of reproduction, with potential consequences for regeneration of these dominant species of lowland tropical forests.  aPublisher supplied data 3aShorea leprosula 3aautumn 3aclimate change 3adrought 3aflowering 3aforest reserves 3amodels 3arain 3areproduction 3aspring 3asummer 3atemperature 3atropical forests 3awinter 3aMalaysia1 aSatake, Akiko1http://orcid.org/0000-0002-0831-86171 aSun, I‐Fang1http://orcid.org/0000-0001-9749-83241 aKosugi, Yoshiko1 aTani, Makoto1 aNumata, Shinya1 aHubbell, Stephen P.1 aFletcher, Christine1 aNur Supardi, Md.

A number of genetic variations have been identified to affect serum ferritin, but there is limited understanding of the genetic variations in serum ferritin. To evaluate the relationships among genetic variations, metabolism and ferritin, we performed a secondary analysis of our previous genome-wide association study of ferritin. After adjusting for population stratification and age, the rs671 in ALDH2 was significantly associated with ferritin concentrations (P-combined = 2.98 × 10⁻⁸). Men carrying the mutated genotype of rs671 had lower serum ferritin levels. BMI was the mediation between rs671 and ferritin (P = 0.003). Moreover, a significant interaction between rs671 and alcohol consumption on ferritin levels was observed (P = 3.02 × 10⁻⁴). rs671 genotypes were significantly relevant to serum ferritin in drinkers (P = 2.39 × 10⁻⁷). We reported that rs671 was associated with ferritin in a manner of BMI mediation. These findings will provide new insights into the impacts of genetic variations and metabolisms on serum ferritin levels.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalcohol drinking 3abiomarkers 3ablood serum 3abody mass index 3aferritin 3agenetic variation 3agenome-wide association study 3agenotype 3agenotype-environment interaction 3ainflammation 3airon 3amen 3ametabolic diseases 3ametabolism 0aROS 0aGWAS 0aALDH2 0aBMI 0aLD 0aFAMHES 0aSF 0aSNP 0aNTC 0aECLIA 0aCV 0aQC 0aGenome-wide association study 0ars671 0aALDH2 0aFerritin 0aSingle nucleotide polymorphisms1 aHuang, Xiaoliang1 aXie, Yuanliang1 aZhou, Xianguo1 aHe, Xiaoli1 aTang, Shaomei1 aLiao, Ming1 aChen, Yang1 aTan, Aihua1 aChen, Yingchun1 aWang, Qiuyan1 aMo, Zengnan1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3236-24980 tGene.g2019 Feb. 15, v. 685 p.196-201dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6378x0378-11197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gene.2018.11.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03076naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100002000141245021100161520159300372592002801965650001301993650002502006650002202031650001802053650001502071650001802086650003002104650001802134650001102152650001002163650002302173650002802196650002102224650001902245650002302264650001402287650002902301650001502330700001802345700002102363700003002384773012002414856007502534852000902609655001202618IND60742449720221121234037.0210624e20210602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074244972DNAL7 a10.3390/ani110616532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIbarruri, Jone 10aSolid State Fermentation as a Tool to Stabilize and Improve Nutritive Value of Fruit and Vegetable Discards: Effect on Nutritional Composition, In Vitro Ruminal Fermentation and Organic Matter Digestibility  aThis research aimed to evaluate in vitro organic matter digestibility, fermentation characteristics and methane production of fruit and vegetable discards processed by solid state fermentation (SSF) by Rhizopus sp. Mixtures were composed of approximately 28% citric fruits, 35% other fruits and 37% vegetables. Fruit and vegetables were processed and fermented to obtain a stabilized product. Nutritional characterization and in vitro ruminal fermentation tests were performed to determine the effect of fungal bioconversion on digestibility, end products and gas production kinetics. Results indicate that SSF reduced organic matter and reducing sugars, while it increased crude protein and neutral detergent fiber, acid detergent fiber and neutral detergent insoluble protein. The in vitro gas production showed that SSF led to a reduction of the organic matter digestibility (p < 0.001), short chain fatty acids (SCFA; p = 0.003) and CH₄ (p = 0.002). SSF reduced the gas production from the insoluble fraction (p = 0.001), without modifying the production rate (p = 0.676) or the lag time (p = 0.574). Regarding SCFA profile, SSF increased acetic (p = 0.020) and decreased propionic (p = 0.004) and butyric (p = 0.006) acids proportions, increasing acetic to propionic (p = 0.008) and acetic plus butyric to propionic (p = 0.011) ratios. SSF succeeded in obtaining a stabilized material enriched in protein, but at the expense of a reduction of protein availability and organic matter digestibility. These changes should be considered before including them in a ruminant’s rations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRhizopus 3aacid detergent fiber 3abiotransformation 3acrude protein 3adetergents 3adigestibility 3adigestible organic matter 3afruit growing 3afruits 3afungi 3amethane production 3aneutral detergent fiber 3anutrient content 3aorganic matter 3arumen fermentation 3aruminants 3asolid state fermentation 3avegetables1 aGoiri, Idoia 1 aCebrián, Marta 1 aGarcía-Rodríguez, Aser 0 tAnimals.g2021 June 02, v. 11, no. 6dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2274x2076-26157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ani110616533Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01131naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100002800138245011800166300001800284520021400302592002800516650002300544650002300567650001100590700002100601700002100622773012900643856007200772852000900844655001200853IND60657527920221120101944.0190816e20040727xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065752792DNAL7 a10.1039/b403827d2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBoñaga, Llorente V.

It transports organic nutrients and long-distance communication signals to all parts of plants. In this report, we describe a promoter from Populus trichocarpa that drives strong gene expression in a phloem tissue-specific manner. First, we identified five candidate genes with strong expression in the developing phloem (DP) tissue from whole-transcriptome gene chip analyses of different tissue types of poplar. The putative promoter sequences of them were isolated and tested for their promoter activity in transgenic Arabidopsis plants. Among them, a promoter of the Potri.001G340200.1 gene (called the PtrDP3 promoter) was identified that has the strongest activity in phloem tissue. PtrDP3 promoter activity was found exclusively in phloem cells of the stem and root tissues of transgenic Arabidopsis plants, which was reproduced in the transgenic poplar plants. The phloemspecific activity of the PtrDP3 promoter was detected as early as in three-day-old seedlings and was not affected by abiotic stresses or exogenously applied plant hormones in transgenic Arabidopsis plants. Promoter deletion analysis identified a 100-bp regulatory region of the PtrDP3 promoter, which is necessary to drive phloem specific expression. This study provides evidence of a strong phloem-specific promoter that is suitable for phloem-specific biotechnological modifications in plants.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArabidopsis 3aDNA microarrays 3aPopulus trichocarpa 3aabiotic stress 3agene expression 3agenes 3anutrients 3aphloem 3aplant hormones 3apromoter regions 3aseedlings 3atransgenic plants 3avascular bundles 3axylem1 aCho, Jin-Seong1 aLee, Ji-Hoon1 aKim, Min-Ha1 aChoi, Young-Im1 aPark, Eung-Jun1 aKim, Won-Chan1 aHwang, Seongbin1 aHan, Kyung-Hwan1 aKo, Jae-Heung0 tJournal of plant biology =.g2017 Apr., v. 60, no. 2 p.129-136dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx1226-92397nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12374-016-0904-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03089naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245007400167500002200241520195100263592002802214650001102242650001902253650001302272650001902285650001102304650001302315650002302328650001402351651001902365653003202384653002402416653001402440653001302454653002002467700001902487700001902506773006102525856008402586852000902670655001202679IND60568671220221120034519.0170628s2017    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056867122DNAL7 a10.1016/j.wasman.2017.05.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKhodier, Ala10aChallenges around automotive shredder residue production and disposal  aPre-press version  aThe challenge for the automotive industry is how to ensure they adopt the circular economy when it comes to the disposal of end-of-life vehicles (ELV). According to the European Commission the UK achieved a total reuse and recovery rate of 88%. This is short of the revised ELV directive target of 95% materials recovery, which requires a minimum of 85% of materials to be recycled or reused. A significant component of the recycling process is the production of automotive shredder residue (ASR). This is currently landfilled across Europe. The additional 10% could be met by processing ASR through either waste-to-energy facilities or Post shredder technology (PST) to recover materials. The UK auto and recycling sectors claimed there would need to be a massive investment by their members in both new capacity and new technology for PST to recover additional recycle materials. It has been shown that 50% of the ASR contains valuable recoverable materials which could be used to meet the Directive target. It is expected in the next 5years that technological innovation in car design will change the composition from easily recoverable metal to difficult polymers. This change in composition will impact on the current drive to integrate the European Circular Economy Package. A positive factor is that main driver for using ASR is coming from the metals recycling industry itself. They are looking to develop the infrastructure for energy generation from ASR and subsequent material recovery. This is driven by the economics of the process rather than meeting the Directive targets. The study undertaken has identified potential pathways and barriers for commercial thermal treatment of ASR. The results of ASR characterisation were used to assess commercial plants from around the world. Whilst there were many claiming that processing of ASR was possible none have so far shown both the technological capability and economic justification.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenergy 3aheat treatment 3aindustry 3ainfrastructure 3ametals 3apolymers 3arecycled materials 3arecycling 3aUnited Kingdom 0aAutomotive shredder residue 0aEnd-of-life vehicle 0aRecycling 0aRecovery 0aWaste-to-energy1 aWilliams, Karl1 aDallison, Neil0 tWaste management.g2017, dElsevier Ltdx0956-053X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2017.05.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02489naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245015400168300001600322520113400338592002801472650001701500650002001517650001101537650002401548650002101572650001901593650001501612650002101627650001401648650002801662650001101690650001401701650001301715700001701728700001901745700001901764700001701783700005001800773011001850856008601960852000902046655001202055IND60619718920221122234135.0190409e201904  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061971892DNAL7 a10.1016/j.idairyj.2018.09.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPan, Mengshi10aPositively charged peptides from casein hydrolysate show strong inhibitory effects on LDL oxidation and cellular lipid accumulation in Raw264.7 cells  ap. 119-128.  aInhibiting low-density lipoprotein (LDL) oxidation and cellular lipid accumulation to reduce foam cell formation plays a key role in preventing atherosclerosis. Casein hydrolysate (66% < 1 kDa) was separated into four different charged fractions. The inhibitory effect of peptide fractions on LDL oxidation and cellular lipid accumulation was analysed using a CuSO4 cell-free system and a Cu2+-mediated and ox-LDL-induced Raw264.7 macrophage cell-based system. Casein peptide fractions not only significantly inhibited LDL oxidation but also prevented cellular lipid accumulation. Positively charged fractions exhibited stronger inhibitory effects than negatively charged fractions. Seven peptides with different charge properties were synthesised. With the increase in net positive charge, the ability of peptides to inhibit LDL oxidation was enhanced. Peptides containing lysine presented better inhibition than those that contained histidine. This study suggests that casein hydrolysate, especially positively charged peptide fractions, could be used as a natural antioxidant in functional foods to prevent atherosclerosis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantioxidants 3aatherosclerosis 3acasein 3acasein hydrolysates 3acell free system 3acopper sulfate 3afoam cells 3afunctional foods 3ahistidine 3alow density lipoprotein 3alysine 3aoxidation 3apeptides1 aHuo, Yanjiao1 aWang, Chengtao1 aZhang, Yanchun1 aDai, Zhiyong1 aLi, Bo1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7548-03340 tInternational dairy journal.g2019 Apr., v. 91 p.119-128dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl48777x0958-69467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.idairyj.2018.09.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03193naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006200148245013400210300001600344520176000360592002802120650002002148650001402168650002302182650001502205650001602220650001102236650002102247650001302268650001302281650001902294650000902313650002302322650001202345650001102357650001202368650001102380650001802391650001502409650001102424651001402435700002002449700002302469773012702492856008302619852000902702655001202711IND60682504920221119024447.0200130e202001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068250492DNAL7 a10.1007/s10533-019-00631-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStelzer, Robert S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2458-875612aA ten year record of nitrate retention and solute trends in a Wisconsin sand plains stream: temporal variation at multiple scales  ap. 125-147.  aNitrate retention is an important ecosystem service provided by streams which reduces nitrogen loads to downstream ecosystems. However, most inferences about nitrate retention and uptake in streams are based on measurements at sub-annual scales. Our objective was to evaluate variation in nitration retention and solute concentrations at weekly to decadal time scales. We measured nitrate and chloride concentration, nitrate flux and nitrate retention in Emmons Creek, a groundwater-dominated, nitrate-rich stream in central Wisconsin during a 10-year period. We used a two-station mass balance approach to measure nitrate retention while accounting for groundwater inputs. Surface water nitrate concentration, nitrate yield and nitrate retention exhibited strong seasonal variation. Seasonal Kendall tests revealed positive trends for surface water discharge, nitrate and chloride concentrations and groundwater chloride concentration, but not nitrate retention. Generalized additive mixed models (GAMM), accounting for serial autocorrelations, also indicated positive trends in surface water nitrate and chloride concentrations but no trend for nitrate retention. Nitrate retention averaged 370 mg NO₃-N m⁻² d⁻¹ (± 316 SD) and was highest during the spring (512 mg NO₃-N m⁻² d⁻¹ ± 319), followed by summer (460 ± 322), fall (340 ± 281) and winter (165 ± 212). Nitrate retention rates in Emmons Creek were relatively high compared to most published estimates. However, our results suggest that Emmons Cr. may have saturated its capacity to retain nitrate during a period when nitrate yield from its watershed increased, which is an important finding given the increases in N availability in many regions of earth.  aPublisher supplied data 3aautocorrelation 3achlorides 3aecosystem services 3aecosystems 3agroundwater 3amodels 3anitrate nitrogen 3anitrates 3anitrogen 3apollution load 3asand 3aseasonal variation 3asolutes 3aspring 3astreams 3asummer 3asurface water 3awatersheds 3awinter 3aWisconsin1 aParr, Thomas B.1 aCoulibaly, Mamadou0 tBiogeochemistry.g2020 Jan., v. 147, no. 2 p.125-147dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl36028x0168-25637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10533-019-00631-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02178naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001900139245014500158300001800303520117700321592002801498650001301526650001701539650001201556650001401568650001101582650001901593650001601612700002001628700001501648773010501663856007501768852000901843655001201852IND60578036720180731000000.0170811e20141223xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057803672DNAL7 a10.1021/ma501892v2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFalls, Zackary14aThe Dynamic Equilibrium Between (AlOMe)n Cages and (AlOMe)n·(AlMe3)m Nanotubes in Methylaluminoxane (MAO): A First-Principles Investigation  ap. 8556-8569.  aSpecies likely to be present in methylaluminoxane (MAO) are studied via dispersion-corrected DFT, which we show is able to accurately predict thermochemical parameters for the dimerization of trimethylaluminum (TMA). Both cage-like, (AlOMe)ₙ,c, and TMA-bound nanotubes, (AlOMe)ₙ,ₜ·(AlMe₃)ₘ, are found to be important components of MAO. The most stable structures have aluminum/oxygen atoms in environments whose average hybridization approaches sp³/sp². The (AlOMe)ₙ,ₜ·(AlMe₃)ₘ isomers with the lowest free energies possess Al−μ-Me–Al bonds. At 298 K a novel Td-(AlOMe)₁₆,c oligomer is one of the most stable structures among the six stoichiometries with the lowest free energies: (AlOMe)₂₀,c·(AlMe₃)₂, Td-(AlOMe)₁₆,c, (AlOMe)₁₈,c, (AlOMe)₂₀,c·(AlMe₃), (AlOMe)₁₀,ₜ·(AlMe₃)₄, and (AlOMe)₂₀,c. As the temperature rises, the abundance of (AlOMe)ₙ,ₜ·(AlMe₃)ₘ decreases, and that of (AlOMe)ₙ,c increases. Because the former are expected to be precursors for the active species in polymerization, this may in part be the reason why the cocatalytic activity of MAO decreases at higher temperatures.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaluminum 3adimerization 3aisomers 3ananotubes 3aoxygen 3apolymerization 3atemperature1 aTymińska, Nina1 aZurek, Eva0 tMacromolecules.g2014 Dec. 23, v. 47, no. 24 p.8556-8569dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fma501892v3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02923naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006500148245012100213300002000334520164400354592002801998650002502026650002002051650001102071650002202082650002302104650001002127650001502137650001202152650002102164650002302185650001602208650001902224650001202243700002002255773017002275856008302445852000902528655001202537IND60662407120221119064541.0200216e201909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066240712DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-019-05807-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGurbuz, Ismail Bulent1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5340-372510aGreen consumerism: the influence of antioxidant parameters and socio-economic values on Tarhana consumption patterns  ap. 25526-25537.  aThis study aimed to examine the production and consumption patterns of the tarhana as a green food product and its content in terms of health value in the socio-economic framework by comparing urban and rural households. To be able to assess the tarhana’s health value, the addition of antioxidative parameters was analysed. We obtained the data as a result of a two-part study. The first part of the research included a structured survey conducted between September and December 2015. In the second part, three types of tarhana samples evaluated in terms of their antioxidant capacity and total phenolic content as extractable, hydrolysable, and bioaccessible phenolics to support the claim that homemade tarhana offers higher nutritional potential and healthier content than commercially produced tarhana. Organic and additive-free homemade tarhana samples have great antioxidative potential, also depending on the content and the production pattern. The results of the antioxidant capacity, total phenolic content analyses, and their bioaccessibility revealed that non-fermented homemade tarhana and cranberry-added tarhana stand out, according to production process and content. Our findings showed that participants mostly produced the tarhana at home. In cases where they could not produce it themselves, they supplied it from their family and friends. This result showed us that participants preferred homemade tarhana over industrial tarhana sold in markets. Rural areas mostly consumed tarhana for its economic value. However, tarhana consumption did not decrease in cities. Only the consumption mode and the times have changed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantioxidant activity 3abioavailability 3acities 3aconsumer behavior 3aeconomic valuation 3afoods 3ahouseholds 3amarkets 3anutrient content 3aphenolic compounds 3arural areas 3asocioeconomics 3asurveys1 aYıldız, Elif,0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research international.g2019 Sept., v. 26, no. 25 p.25526-25537dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-019-05807-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02075naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002600148245009300174300001600267520078500283592002801068650001501096650002801111650001601139650001201155650001501167650001901182650001501201650002101216653001601237653002601253653002001279653001401299653001401313653002501327700002901352700002101381700002601402773013301428856008301561852000901644655001201653IND60584082820221118015802.0180905e201712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058408282DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enmm.2017.10.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMoschopoulou, Georgia10aAssessment of pesticides cytoxicity by means of bioelectric profiling of mammalian cells  ap. 254-260.  aIn the present study an innovative tool was performed for assessing pesticide cytoxicity of different pesticide groups by using the bioelectric response patterns of neuroblastoma and fibroblast cell lines.

H.10aOxygen Scrambling of CO2 Adsorbed on CaO(001)  ap. 18625-18634.  aThe adsorption of CO₂ on CaO(001) is investigated by density functional theory and infrared reflection absorption spectroscopy (IRAS). The calculations show that isolated CO₂ adsorbates on terraces as monodentate carbonates can freely rotate at room temperature, while rotation within carbonate aggregates has some hindrance. Rotation and other motions are important to facilitate oxygen atom exchange between the CO₂ adsorbate and CaO lattice. The calculated intrinsic barrier to oxygen scrambling is 114 kJ/mol for an isolated carbonate species and 148 kJ/mol within a long carbonate chain. However, due to the large adsorption energy for CO₂ on a defect-free CaO terrace site, the apparent barrier becomes −39 kJ/mol for an isolated carbonate. At lower coordinated sites with higher degrees of freedom, the calculated intrinsic barrier to oxygen atom exchange is 80 kJ/mol at filled monatomic step sites and 26.9 kJ/mol at corner sites. IRAS studies are performed by adsorbing C¹⁸O₂ on well-ordered Ca¹⁶O films grown on Mo and Ru substrates. The magnitude and splitting of the red shifts due to isotopic labeling are rationalized when considering oxygen scrambling, such that observed normal modes of surface carbonates involve both ¹⁶O–C and ¹⁸O–C vibrations. As previously assigned, the earliest observable infrared peaks are due to adsorption at step sites, and additional observable peaks are due to aggregation of carbonates on terraces.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3aambient temperature 3acalcium oxide 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbonates 3aenergy 3aisotope labeling 3amolybdenum 3aoxygen 3aspectroscopy 3aterraces1 aSauer, Joachim1 aCui, Yi1 aShaikhutdinov, Shamil1 aFreund, H.-J.,0 tThe Journal of Physical Chemistry C.g2017 Aug. 31, v. 121, no. 34 p.18625-18634dAmerican Chemical Societyx1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.jpcc.7b052933Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01749naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002700147245005800174300001400232520066200246592002800908650001400936650002400950650003900974650004301013650002001056650001101076650001401087650001801101700002401119700003301143700002901176773010401205856008101309852000901390655001201399IND60121323720221119224433.0150224e201503  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012132372DNAL7 a10.1007/s11130-014-0454-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPardo-Barrela, Jessica10aComparison of Methods for Rapid Analysis of Quercetin  ap. 91-96.  aQuercetin is a polyphenol of growing interest that is present in many foods.

To confirm the identification of the quercetin in the samples an HPLC-PDA-MS/MS system was used. It was concluded that both methods are suitable for dietary supplements and the choice of one or the other depends on the type of sample, time available for the analysis as well as the available resources.

Histopathological examinations revealed variable numbers of intracytoplasmic basophilic microorganisms in the macrophages, hepatocytes, and renal epithelium of most birds, along with occasional botryoid intracytoplasmic inclusion bodies within histiocytes in the bursa of Fabricius. Based on the results of histopathological examinations, immunohistochemical staining, transmission electron microscopy, and polymerase chain reactions, genotype B Chlamydia psittaci infection concurrent with pigeon circovirus (PiCV) was diagnosed. A retrospective survey, including two years before the outbreak and the outbreak year, of C. psittaci and PiCV infections of dead birds in the aviaries, revealed that the outbreak was an independent episode. The findings of this study indicate that concurrent infection with C. psittaci and PiCV might lead to lethal outbreaks of chlamydiosis, particularly Streptopelia orientalis. In addition, persistently monitoring both pathogens and identifying potential PiCV carriers or transmitters might also help prevent lethal disease outbreaks.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChlamydophila psittaci 3aPigeon circovirus 3aStreptopelia orientalis 3abursa of Fabricius 3achlamydiosis 3adeath 3aepithelium 3agenotype 3ahepatocytes 3ahistiocytes 3ahistopathology 3aimmunohistochemistry 3amixed infection 3aspring 3asurveys 3atransmission electron microscopy 3azoos1 aTeng, Chin-Ann 1 aShi, Zhengxin,1 aHuang, Wei-Hsiang 1 aJiang, Yi-Fan 1 aZhang, Huiwen,1 aJeng, Chian-Ren 1 aLai, Yen-Hsueh 1 aGuo, Jun-Cheng 1 aWang, Baorong,1 aCheng, Chiu-Hung 1 aZhang, Yanzhen,0 tAnimals.g2021 June 02, v. 11, no. 6dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2274x2076-26157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ani110616543Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02311naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100003200184245011800216300002000334506007600354520119300430592002801623506003701651650001201688650000901700650001101709650001001720773017501730856008301905852000901988655001201997IND4481632820221207143711.0120502e20111206xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448163282DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.11130501082doi7 aPMC32418212pmcid7 a221062802pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 avon Cramon-Taubadel, Noreen10aGlobal human mandibular variation reflects differences in agricultural and hunter-gatherer subsistence strategies  ap. 19546-19551.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aVariation in the masticatory behavior of hunter-gatherer and agricultural populations is hypothesized to be one of the major forces affecting the form of the human mandible. However, this has yet to be analyzed at a global level. Here, the relationship between global mandibular shape variation and subsistence economy is tested, while controlling for the potentially confounding effects of shared population history, geography, and climate. The results demonstrate that the mandible, in contrast to the cranium, significantly reflects subsistence strategy rather than neutral genetic patterns, with hunter-gatherers having consistently longer and narrower mandibles than agriculturalists. These results support notions that a decrease in masticatory stress among agriculturalists causes the mandible to grow and develop differently. This developmental argument also explains why there is often a mismatch between the size of the lower face and the dentition, which, in turn, leads to increased prevalence of dental crowding and malocclusions in modern postindustrial populations. Therefore, these results have important implications for our understanding of human masticatory adaptation.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aclimate 3aface 3ahumans 3ateeth0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2011 Dec. 6, v. 108, no. 49 p.19546-19551dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.11130501083Available from publisher's Web site  aDNAL 7aarticle01745naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002000139245016500159300001800324520068700342592002801029650001601057650001601073650001301089650001101102650002101113650001101134650001901145650001301164700001901177700002201196773010501218856007501323852000901398655001201407IND60578036820221121235127.0170811e20141223xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057803682DNAL7 a10.1021/ma501959h2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSteinmann, Mark10aPoly(alkylidene chlorophosphate)s via Acyclic Diene Metathesis Polymerization: A General Platform for the Postpolymerization Modification of Poly(phosphoester)s  ap. 8506-8513.  aReactive poly(phosphoester)s (PPEs) have been prepared via the acyclic diene metathesis polymerization of the monomers di(buten-3-yl) chlorophosphate and di(undecen-10-yl) chlorophosphate.

Their structures were established by interpretation of the NMR spectroscopic and mass spectrometric data. X-ray crystallographic analysis of compound 1, which represents the first crystal structure described for a sulfur-containing 12-membered macrolide, confirmed its structure and absolute configuration. The proposed sulfur side chain at C-3 in pandangolide 3 (5) was revised to be at C-2 by detailed analysis of the NMR data and by a comparison with data for thiocladospolide A (1). The structures for pandangolides 2 and 4 should also be considered for revisions. The isolated compounds were evaluated for the antimicrobial activities against aquatic bacteria and plant pathogens.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBruguiera gymnorhiza 3aCladosporium cladosporioides 3aX-ray diffraction 3aantimicrobial properties 3aaquatic bacteria 3acrystal structure 3aendophytes 3afungi 3ahydrolysis 3aleaves 3amacrolides 3amass spectrometry 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aplant pathogens 3asulfur1 aLi, Xiao Ming,1 aYang, Sui-Qun1 aMeng, Ling-Hong1 aWang, Bin-Gui1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0116-61950 tJournal of natural products.g2019 Apr. 30, v. 82, no. 6 p.1535-1541dAmerican Chemical Society and American Society of PharmacognosywJournal:jnl11422x1520-60257nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jnatprod.8b010913Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03039naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001500144245018200159300002000341520151500361592002801876650002401904650001101928650002201939650001101961650001501972650002101987650001502008650002202023650002402045650001702069650001402086653001802100653002202118653001902140653003702159653002002196700001302216700001402229700001802243700001802261700001602279700001602295700001802311773012902329856007802458852000902536655001202545IND60570008120221119051801.0170627e20170614xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057000812DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.7b014182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Juan10aEngineering the Composition and Structure of Bimetallic Au–Cu Alloy Nanoparticles in Carbon Nanofibers: Self-Supported Electrode Materials for Electrocatalytic Water Splitting  ap. 19756-19765.  aThe bimetallic Au–Cu alloy nanoparticles have been constructed in electrospun carbon nanofibers (Au–Cu/CNFs), employing as high efficient hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) electrode. The morphology, structure, and composition of bimetallic Au–Cu alloy can be controlled by adjusting the precursor nanofibers through a facile approach. With the increased Cu content, the Au–Cu alloy have a transition from the homogeneous AuCu₃ alloy phase to the Au₃Cu phase with Cu shell. The self-supported bimetallic Au–Cu/CNFs hybrid can be directly employed as electrode materials for water splitting, and it showed excellent electrochemical activity, including long-term stability, high exchange current density, and low overpotential. The outstanding HER performance could be mainly attributed to the synergistic interactions and interfacial effects of Au–Cu alloy with high densities of uncoordinated surface atoms. In addition, the fast charge transport and the fast kinetic for the desorption of the gas were originated from the self-supported three-dimensional architectures consist of integrated Au–Cu/CNFs networks. The Au–Cu/CNFs with mass ratio of 1:2 (Au₃Cu–Cu “core-shell” alloy) obtain the lowest overpotential of 83 mV (at j = 10 mA cm–²), lowest Tafel slope of 70 mV dec–¹, and highest exchange current density of 0.790 mA cm–². The present investigations offer a new strategy for the design and synthesis of unique nanocrystals in energy conversion related application.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalloy nanoparticles 3aalloys 3acarbon nanofibers 3acopper 3adesorption 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3aenergy conversion 3ahydrogen production 3ananocrystals 3asynergism 0aAu−Cu alloy 0amaterials science 0aeletrospinning 0aelectrocatalytic water splitting 0ahydrogen energy1 aZhu, Han1 aYu, Danni1 aChen, Jiawei,1 aChen, JiaDong1 aZhang, Ming1 aWang, Lina,1 aDu, MingLiang0 tACS applied materials .g2017 June 14, v. 9, no. 23 p.19756-19765dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.7b014183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02866naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001700094024002100111040001800132100002200150245008600172300001800258506017300276520116100449650001501610650001801625650002001643650001301663650001901676650001501695650001701710650001901727650002201746650003001768650001501798650001101813650002601824650001501850650001501865700002101880700002101901700002301922700002101945773010301966856011202069956018502181961000902366852000902375655001202384IND50068719620221214224713.0130813s2012    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006871962DNAL7 a2841922aris7 a10113/572352hdl  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCallaway, Todd R.10aPrebiotics in food animals, a potential to reduce foodborne pathogens and disease  ap. 7808-7816.  aWorks produced by employees of the U.S. Government as part of their official duties are not copyrighted within the U.S. The content of this document is not copyrighted.  aAnimals can be seriously impacted by bacterial pathogens that affect their growth efficiency and overall health, as well as food safety of animal derived products. Some pathogenic bacteria, such as Salmonella, can be a shared problem for both human and animal health, and can be found in many animal species. A fully-mature ecosystem (the intestinal tract) occupies all environmental niches and utilizes nearly all available nutrients, which tends to exclude pathogenic bacteria from the complex gastrointestinal microbial population. Utilization of this native or artificially-introduced microflora population to improve animal health and productivity has been termed a “probiotic”, or competitive enhancement strategy. Advantages of harnessing the natural microbial ecosystem against the pathogens include ease of application and low economic and labor costs, and the use of a native microbial population to reduce transient pathogens is seen as a “natural” strategy. In this review, we will focus on the use of prebiotics and discuss the theory behind these compounds and their benefits, and challenges for future implementation in food animals. 3aSalmonella 3aanimal health 3aanimal products 3abacteria 3aeconomic costs 3aecosystems 3afood animals 3afood pathogens 3afoodborne illness 3aintestinal microorganisms 3aintestines 3aniches 3anutrient availability 3aprebiotics 3aprobiotics1 aEdrington, T.

With the aim to apply the Oxygen-Radical Absorbance Capacity assay (ORAC), to detect the polysaccharides capacity to scavenge the peroxyl radical, four different grafted chitosan derivatives were synthesized. Among the synthesized derivatives, N-acetyl cysteine-g-chitosan was found to have the highest ORAC value, while gallic acid-g-chitosan and p-hydroxybenzoic acid-g-chitosan had respective 70% and 42% of ORAC values of the former. On the contrary, p-methoxybenzoic acid-g-chitosan did not show any significant difference in antioxidant activity from the unmodified chitosan. A linear correlation between ORAC values and total phenols measured with the FolinâCiocalteau reagent was shown. The combination of ORAC and FolinâCiocalteau assays is a useful system to monitor the growth of the acquired antioxidant capacity in relation to the type of phenolic compound used for grafting.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorbance 3aantioxidant activity 3achitosan 3afoods 3afree radical scavengers 3afree radicals 3aphenols1 aGennari, Lorenzo1 aAngelino, Donato1 aNinfali, Paolino1 aCastagnino, Enzo0 tFood hydrocolloids.g2012 Aug., v. 28, no. 2 p.243-247dElsevier Ltdx0268-005X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodhyd.2012.01.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02594naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100006300151245011100214520101300325592002801338650002201366650001901388650001401407650002301421650002501444650001901469650002001488650001801508650001401526650002301540650001401563650001101577650001401588650002101602650001301623650001301636650001101649650001501660653000801675653002801683653001301711653002301724653001801747653002101765653000901786700006901795773011801864856008501982852000902067655001202076IND60679990020221121030725.0200103e20200101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067999002DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jenvman.2019.1097072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGrossule, Valentina1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5745-161714aThe treatment of leachate using Black Soldier Fly (BSF) larvae: Adaptability and resource recovery testing  aThe benefits of using Black Soldier Fly (BSF) larvae in biowaste treatment include: commercial value of the stabilized residue, production of biomass rich in fats and proteins, suitable both for biodiesel production and animal feeding. The use of BSF for leachate treatment would introduce a blue low cost solution in the landfill technology, particularly appropriate in developing countries, where landfilling is still widely applied. This paper aimed to investigate the adaptability of BSF larvae to leachate environment, by using different leachate concentrations (25%, 50%, 75%, 100%) and two different feeding substrates: liquid (pure leachate) and semi-solid (wheat bran mixed with leachate). In all tests mortality was less than 50% and it was mainly linked to food shortages: the higher the nutrient content in leachate, the higher the larval development. Dry mass characterisation demonstrate that BSF prepupae biomass can be exploited as an alternative energy source in the production of biodiesel.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHermetia illucens 3aanimal feeding 3abiodiesel 3abiomass production 3adeveloping countries 3afood shortages 3afuel production 3ainsect larvae 3alandfills 3alarval development 3aleachates 3alipids 3amortality 3anutrient content 3aprepupae 3aproteins 3awastes 3awheat bran 0aMSW 0aSustainable landfilling 0aLow cost 0aResources recovery 0aEcotoxicology 0aCircular economy 0aDC'S1 aLavagnolo, Maria Cristina1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2543-22780 tJournal of environmental management.g2020 Jan. 01, v. 253 p.109707-dElsevier LtdwJournal:2018x0301-47977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2019.1097073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03704naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002300139245011600162300001600278500002000294520219500314592002802509650001602537650002502553650002302578650001102601650002102612650001402633650001502647650002302662650002202685650001102707650001302718650002102731650002102752650003102773650001502804650001702819650001802836650002002854700002102874700002602895700002102921700001902942700002502961773013002986856007303116852000903189655001203198IND60587649520221122140256.0180102e201504  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058764952DNAL7 a10.1890/14-1113.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKominoski, John S.10aLow‐to‐moderate nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations accelerate microbially driven litter breakdown rates  ap. 856-865.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aParticulate organic matter (POM) processing is an important driver of aquatic ecosystem productivity that is sensitive to nutrient enrichment and drives ecosystem carbon (C) loss. Although studies of single concentrations of nitrogen (N) or phosphorus (P) have shown effects at relatively low concentrations, responses of litter breakdown rates along gradients of low‐to‐moderate N and P concentrations are needed to establish likely interdependent effects of dual N and P enrichment on baseline activity in stream ecosystems. We established 25 combinations of dissolved inorganic N (DIN; 55–545 μg/L) and soluble reactive P (SRP; 4–86 μg/L) concentrations with corresponding N:P molar ratios of 2–127 in experimental stream channels. We excluded macroinvertebrates, focusing on microbially driven breakdown of maple (Acer rubrum L.) and rhododendron (Rhododendron maximum L.) leaf litter. Breakdown rates, k, per day (d⁻¹) and per degree‐day (dd⁻¹), increased by up to 6× for maple and 12× for rhododendron over our N and P enrichment gradient compared to rates at low ambient N and P concentrations. The best models of k (d⁻¹ and dd⁻¹) included litter species identity and N and P concentrations; there was evidence for both additive and interactive effects of N and P. Models explaining variation in k dd⁻¹ were supported by N and P for both maple and rhododendron (= 0.67 and 0.33, respectively). Residuals in the relationship between k dd⁻¹ and N concentration were largely explained by P, but residuals for k dd⁻¹ and P concentration were less adequately explained by N. Breakdown rates were more closely related to nutrient concentrations than variables associated with measurements of two mechanistic parameters associated with C loss (fungal biomass and microbial respiration rate). We also determined the effects of nutrient addition on litter C : nutrient stoichiometry and found reductions in litter C:N and C:P along our experimental nutrient gradient. Our results indicate that microbially driven litter processing rates increase across low‐to‐moderate nutrient gradients that are now common throughout human‐modified landscapes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcer rubrum 3aRhododendron maximum 3aaquatic ecosystems 3acarbon 3acell respiration 3aheat sums 3alandscapes 3amacroinvertebrates 3amicrobial biomass 3amodels 3anitrogen 3anitrogen content 3anutrient content 3aparticulate organic matter 3aphosphorus 3aplant litter 3astoichiometry 3astream channels1 aRosemond, Amy D.1 aBenstead, Jonathan P.1 aGulis, Vladislav1 aMaerz, John C.1 aManning, David W.

Three hypothetical scenarios were proposed with variations in the disconnection rate (α) within the lot, the soil infiltration conditions, and the rainfall patterns. Simulations were performed using the Storm Water Management Model (SWMM) with the implementation of a high spatial resolution model which allowed the explicit representation of the routing runoff between distinct surfaces. The results revealed a linear relationship trend between the total amount of rainfall (P) and total runoff (q), with identification of a possible precipitation threshold above the point at which a more critical condition of runoff generation is established. The value of this threshold was shown to be dependent on the degree of efficiency of the receptor permeable areas, which is associated with the disconnection rate and infiltrability of the soil. The results also showed that for a very high disconnection rate and lower infiltrability, runoff can increase substantially, with significant changes in the hydrographs simulated for longer storm events.  aPublisher supplied data 3agreen infrastructure 3ahydrograph 3amodels 3arain 3arunoff 3asoil 3astorms 3astormwater management 3aurban areas 0aDisconnection of impervious areas 0aGreen space depression 0aLow-impact development 0aStorm water management model 0aHydrologic simulation1 aSilva, Gustavo Barbosa Lima da0 tJournal of environmental management.g2020 Jan. 01, v. 253 p.109719-dElsevier LtdwJournal:2018x0301-47977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2019.1097193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02404naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004000092040001800132100001800150245012900168300001500297500001500312520126600327592002801593650001901621650002401640650001801664650001301682650001901695650000901714650001701723650002201740650001501762650001201777651001401789653002501803700001701828773007801845856008601923852000902009655001202018IND4475707820221118064328.0141111e201203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447570782DNAL7 a10.1016/j.geoderma.2011.12.0242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYassir, Ishak10aSoil organic matter chemistry changes upon secondary succession in Imperata Grasslands, Indonesia: A pyrolysis–GC/MS study  ap. 94-103.  a2019-12-06  aThe chemical composition of soil organic matter (SOM) following secondary succession in Imperata grassland was investigated by Pyrolysis-Gas Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry (GC/MS). We studied 46 samples from different stages of succession using plots that last burned 3 and 9years previously, secondary forest (≥15years), primary forest and Acacia mangium plantation (9years). During regeneration of Imperata grasslands the chemical composition of SOM changes considerably. Differences between litters and SOM were larger than within SOM, which is mainly due to a rapid degradation of lignin in the soil. Both litter and SOM under Imperata contain larger amounts of carbohydrates and fewer lignin moieties, aliphatics and N-compounds than those under secondary and primary forest. Nevertheless, SOM degradation under grassland is less efficient because of scarcity of N-compounds. SOM decomposition is most advanced under forest, as indicated by lower amounts of plant derived compounds and higher contribution of microbial matter. Decomposition efficiency appears to be related to SOM chemistry, but more to abundance of N-compounds than to that of potentially recalcitrant compounds. C stocks were linked to decomposition efficiency and litter production.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcacia mangium 3asoil organic matter 3acarbohydrates 3aImperata 3achromatography 3asoil 3acarbon sinks 3amass spectrometry 3agrasslands 3aforests 3aIndonesia 0achemical composition1 aBuurman, P.,0 tGeoderma.g2012 Mar., v. 173-174 p.94-103dElsevier B.V.x0016-70617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.geoderma.2011.12.0243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03044naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001300148245011400161300001600275520163900291592002801930650001501958650001301973650001501986650003802001650001402039650002002053650002302073650002602096650001702122653001002139653002102149653001802170653002602188700001602214700001702230700001502247700001502262700001802277700001302295700001602308700001602324700001902340773011102359856008302470852000902553655001202562IND60568671720221123041757.0180831e20171015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056867172DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bios.2017.04.0442doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Dan12aA fully integrated distance readout ELISA-Chip for point-of-care testing with sample-in-answer-out capability  ap. 332-338.  aEnzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) is a popular laboratory technique for detection of disease-specific protein biomarkers with high specificity and sensitivity. However, ELISA requires labor-intensive and time-consuming procedures with skilled operators and spectroscopic instrumentation. Simplification of the procedures and miniaturization of the devices are crucial for ELISA-based point-of-care (POC) testing in resource-limited settings. Here, we present a fully integrated, instrument-free, low-cost and portable POC platform which integrates the process of ELISA and the distance readout into a single microfluidic chip. Based on manipulation using a permanent magnet, the process is initiated by moving magnetic beads with capture antibody through different aqueous phases containing ELISA reagents to form bead/antibody/antigen/antibody sandwich structure, and finally converts the molecular recognition signal into a highly sensitive distance readout for visual quantitative bioanalysis. Without additional equipment and complicated operations, our integrated ELISA-Chip with distance readout allows ultrasensitive quantitation of disease biomarkers within 2h. The ELISA-Chip method also showed high specificity, good precision and great accuracy. Furthermore, the ELISA-Chip system is highly applicable as a sandwich-based platform for the detection of a variety of protein biomarkers. With the advantages of visual analysis, easy operation, high sensitivity, and low cost, the integrated sample-in-answer-out ELISA-Chip with distance readout shows great potential for quantitative POCT in resource-limited settings.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantibodies 3aantigens 3abiomarkers 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3aequipment 3ainstrumentation 3amagnetic materials 3apoint-of-care testing 3aspectroscopy 0aELISA 0aDistance readout 0aMicrofluidics 0aPoint-of-care testing1 aLi, Xingrui1 aZhou, Junkai1 aLiu, Shibo1 aTian, Tian1 aSong, Yanling1 aZhu, Zhi1 aZhou, Leiji1 aJi, Tianhai1 aYang, Chaoyong0 tBiosensors & bioelectronics.g2017 Oct. 15, v. 96 p.332-338dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11631x0956-56637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bios.2017.04.0443Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03866naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094024002200131024001900153040001800172100002100190245016600211300001600377506007600393520206300469592002802532506003702560650002402597650001302621650001302634650001702647650003902664650001302703650001102716650001902727650002102746650001202767650001902779650001202798650001702810650002202827650002802849650001902877650001402896653002202910653002302932653002702955653001902982653001903001653001903020773019303039856008303232852000903315655001203324IND60584083120221207144011.0190417e201712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058408312DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijvsm.2017.09.0052doi7 aPMC61378572pmcid7 a302550602pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEl-Bahrawy, K.A.14aThe influence of caffeine supplementation and concerted utilization of enzymatic and mechanical semen liquefaction on freezability of dromedary camel spermatozoa  ap. 121-127.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aAssisted reproductive technologies have been reported to improve reproductive efficiency and genetic potential in camelids. Two experiments were carried out to determine efficiency of centrifugation in the presence of a mucolytic agent for liquefaction of dromedary semen. In the first experiment, three groups, namely: I. Tris lactose (TL, control), II. Tris lactose supplemented with amylase (TL_A) and III. Tris lactose supplemented with amylase followed by seminal plasma removal via centrifugation (TL_A_Cent.) and re-suspension into enzyme free TL media. After equilibration, control group recorded 62.85 ± 4.28% motility and 1.3 ± 0.13 viscosity score, while TL_A group values were 72.88 ± 3.30% and 0.83 ± 0.07%, respectively. TL_A_Cent. group showed significant viscosity reduction (0.33 ± 0.05) and motility decline 47.85 ± 3.04% with increment in abnormalities and detached acrosome. The second experiment investigated the effect of caffeine addition to tolerate enzymatic and mechanical stress. Using 4 mM caffeine in amylase-treated semen (TL_AC) improved post-thaw motility 50.0 ± 1.29% and recovery rate 77.8 ± 3.83% compared to the control (40.17 ± 2.79% and 62.55 ± 8.39%), respectively. Caffeine supplemented centrifuged samples (TL_AC_Cent.) showed superiority (P < .05) in post-thaw motility and recovery rate (38.33 ± 6.41%, 62.76 ± 8.10%) compared to centrifuged samples TL_A_Cent. without caffeine addition (25.00 ± 2.88% and 40.47 ± 3.48%), respectively. Sperm kinetics showed that TL_A exhibited high (p < .05) values for mostly all sperm kinetics. Caffeine treatments showed superiority in velocity curved line (VCL, µm/s) 94.24 ± 8.44 for TL_AC and 104.25 ± 8.72 for the TL_AC_Cent. group compared to 86.8 ± 5.54 for TL_A, and 85.73 ± 5.99 for the TL_A_Cent. groups. In conclusion, preforming a combined enzymatic-mechanical protocol in the presence of an antioxidant may be crucial for refinement of camel semen cryopreservation.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aCamelus dromedarius 3aacrosome 3aamylases 3aantioxidants 3aassisted reproductive technologies 3acaffeine 3acamels 3acentrifugation 3acryopreservation 3adecline 3agenetic traits 3alactose 3aliquefaction 3amechanical stress 3areproductive efficiency 3aseminal plasma 3aviscosity 0aDetached acrosome 0aPost-thaw motility 0aSemen cryopreservation 0aSemen dynamics 0aSemen kinetics 0aSeminal plasma0 tInternational journal of veterinary science and medicine.g2017 Dec., v. 5, no. 2 p.121-127dElsevier B.V.aFaculty of Veterinary Medicine, Cairo UniversitywJournal:21657x2314-45997nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijvsm.2017.09.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02829naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001800145245014800163300001800311500001500329520140700344592002801751650001801779650002001797650001601817650002601833650002701859650001501886650001501901650002401916650002301940650001101963650001101974650001101985650000901996650000902005650001202014651001202026651001702038653001602055700001902071700002302090700002102113700002402134700001702158773009102175856004802266852000902314655001202323IND4467464620221118110022.0121003e201105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446746462DNAL7 a10.1007/s00227-011-1626-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGrote, Britta10aLipids and fatty acids as indicators of egg condition, larval feeding and maternal effects in Cape hakes (Merluccius paradoxus and M. capensis)  ap. 1005-1017.  a2019-12-06  aCape hakes, Merluccius paradoxus and M. capensis, are important gadoid fish that are commercially harvested in the Benguela Current system off Namibia and South Africa. The aim of this study was to elucidate the nutritional condition and feeding preferences of their larvae. Hake eggs and larvae were sampled in austral spring of two consecutive years, 2007 and 2008, off the west coast of South Africa. They were identified to species using genetics, and total lipid content and fatty acid (FA) composition were analysed for each individual egg and larva to compare the condition of different early life stages of both hake species. Higher abundances of M. paradoxus eggs and larvae were consistently found compared to M. capensis. In both species, eggs contained wax esters (WE) and had significantly higher lipid content per dry mass than larvae. Lipid content as well as FA composition changed with the developmental stage of larvae. Quantities of essential fatty acid (EFA) increased with feeding of larvae due to dietary lipid incorporation. In 2007, yolk-sac larvae contained significantly lower total lipids than in 2008. It is argued that this was due to reduced lipid transfer by the spawning females to the eggs. These findings indicate that maternal effects are important in determining condition of hake larvae and that this may have an effect on their survival and subsequent recruitment.  aPublisher supplied data 3alipid content 3amaternal effect 3adietary fat 3aessential fatty acids 3afatty acid composition 3awax esters 3aMerluccius 3afeeding preferences 3alarval development 3aspring 3acoasts 3alarvae 3ahake 3aeggs 3afemales 3aNamibia 3aSouth Africa 0arecruitment1 aHagen, Wilhelm1 aLipinski, Marek R.1 aVerheye, Hans M.1 aStenevik, Erling K.1 aEkau, Werner0 tMarine biology.g2011 May, v. 158, no. 5 p.1005-1017dSpringer-Verlagx0025-31627nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00227-011-1626-6  aDNAL 7aarticle02081naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001600152245010700168300001600275520097700291592002801268650002301296650002201319650002601341650001101367653002501378653002801403653002501431653001001456700001901466700001601485700002801501773010601529856008701635852000901722655001201731IND60573059220221119162943.0190409e201710  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057305922DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2017.05.1922doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuang, Long10aEnhanced polyhydroxyalkanoate production by mixed microbial culture with extended cultivation strategy  ap. 802-811.  aLow biomass output is a crucial reason for low polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) production in mixed microbial cultures (MMCs) PHA process. In this research, an extended cultivation strategy was proposed to rapidly expand the biomass yield of PHA accumulating MMCs and conserve the PHA accumulating ability simultaneously. High PHA content of the cultivated MMCs of 71.4% and 66.7% (higher than 62.1% of the seed biomass) in batch assays and biomass magnification of 43 and 52 were obtained after 10days of extended cultivation with and without sludge discharge, respectively. By embedding the extended cultivation process into the production process, a highly competitive PHA production performance in terms of overall PHA storage yield (0.49g CODPHA/gCODVFA) and volumetric productivity (1.21gPHA/L/d with final cell density of 17.22g/L) was achieved. The proposed PHA production process based on the extended cultivation can be a promising choice in industrial scale practice.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiomass production 3amicrobial culture 3apolyhydroxyalkanoates 3asludge 0aPolyhydroxyalkanoate 0aMixed microbial culture 0aExtended cultivation 0aYield1 aChen, Zhiqiang1 aWen, Qinxue1 aLee, D.

Significant morphological differences between vitellogenic oocytes and ovarian follicles were found. The lowest batch fecundity values were recorded in Hemigrammus marginatus (480 ± 163) and Orthospinus franciscensis (1701 ± 562), which were the smaller species in terms of total length, body weight and oocyte diameter. The highest batch fecundity value was observed in Tetragonopterus chalceus (8384 ± 3944) having the highest GSI and oocyte diameter. Batch fecundity and gonad weight was highly correlated followed by body weight and total length. Relative fecundity was estimated per unit total length, body weight and gonad weight. The wide variation in fecundity observed between the specimens and the species analysed is possibly related to the multiple spawning reproductive strategy of these fishes. Since T. chalceus have higher values of batch and relative fecundity, it is concluded that this species has a higher reproductive potential than the other forage species studied.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCharacidae 3abody weight 3afecundity 3afish 3aforage 3aoocytes 3aovarian follicles 3awatersheds 3aBrazil1 aFerreira, C.

Traditional leafy vegetables (TLVs) are dense in iron, zinc, and β-carotene concentrations. Therefore, they are deemed suitable to improve the dietary diversity of RRPHs. The main objective of this study was to assess the effect of irrigation regimes on nutritional water productivity (NWP) of selected leafy vegetables [Amaranthus cruentus (Amaranth) and Cleome gynandra (Spider flower), both TLVs, and Beta vulgaris (Swiss chard)]. Experiments were conducted under a rain shelter at the ARC-VOP, Pretoria, South Africa, during two consecutive seasons (2013/14 and 2014/15). Leafy vegetables were subjected to three irrigation regimes [well-watered (I₃₀), moderate water stress (I₅₀), and severe water stress (I₈₀)]. Data collected [(aboveground biomass (AGB), aboveground edible biomass (AGEB), actual evapotranspiration, and nutrient concentrations (iron, zinc and β-carotene)] were used to calculate NWP of leafy vegetables. Swiss chard exhibited a higher portion of AGEB compared to TLVs due to its larger harvest index (0.57-0.92). Selected TLVs displayed superiority in terms of nutrient richness compared to Swiss chard, under I₅₀. Results indicated that TLVs could provide more than the daily-recommended nutrient intake (DRNI) for vitamin A to all age groups. For iron, Spider flower could supply more than the DRNI to infants between 1 and 3 years of age, whereas for zinc, it could supply approximately 11% to this age group. However, higher micronutrient and β-carotene concentrations did not translate to superior nutritional yield (NY). Swiss chard showed higher Fe-NY and Zn-NY, whereas TLVs were rich in β-carotene-NY. Similarly, Swiss chard demonstrated the highest Fe-NWP (1090 mg m⁻³) and Zn-NWP (125 mg m⁻³), whereas Amaranth was larger in β-carotene-NWP (1799 mg m⁻³), under moderate water stress. These results show that there may be an opportunity to improve NWP under drought conditions. There is a need for future studies that will assess NWP for a wider range of leafy vegetables. These studies should be conducted in different locations and explore the effect of management factors (fertiliser, water stress, planting density and planting date), and soil type on NWP of micronutrients and β-carotene.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAmaranthus cruentus 3aBeta vulgaris subsp. vulgaris 3aGynandropsis gynandra 3aaboveground biomass 3abeta-carotene 3adata collection 3adrought 3aevapotranspiration 3aflowers 3agreen leafy vegetables 3aharvest index 3ahouseholds 3ainfants 3airon 3airrigation management 3anutrient content 3anutrient intake 3aplant density 3aplanting date 3aplanting density 3arain 3asoil types 3avitamin A 3awater stress 3azinc 3aSouth Africa 0aDeficit irrigation 0aHidden hunger 0aAfrican leafy vegetables 0aMicronutrient deficiency 0aIrrigation regimes 0aIndigenous leafy vegetables1 aVan Halsema, G.E.1 aBeletse, Y.G.1 aAnnandale, J.G.1 aStruik, P.C.0 tAgricultural water management.g2018 Oct. 30, v. 209 p.111-122dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl8460x0378-37747nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agwat.2018.07.0253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02824naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245013600168300001800304520158700322592002801909650001701937650002101954650001101975650003501986650001502021651001002036653002902046653002702075653004702102653001602149653001902165700001202184700001602196700001602212773011502228856008602343852000902429655001202438IND60619719720221122234241.0181127e20190101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061971972DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2018.09.0592doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Lihui10aRenewable energy project performance evaluation using a hybrid multi-criteria decision-making approach: Case study in Fujian, China  ap. 1123-1137.  aThe evaluation of the best renewable energy project (REP) among many alternatives is a complicated multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) problem, which usually involves several criteria in economy, technicality, environment and society. To solve this problem, a hybrid approach mixing 2-dimension uncertain linguistic variables (2DULVs), a cloud model and an extended TODIM (an acronym in Portuguese of interactive and multicriteria decision making) together to evaluate REPs efficiently is proposed. Firstly, because of the extra reliability assessment, the 2DULVs are adopted by decision-makers (DMs) to evaluate the performance of alternatives. Secondly, given that the cloud model could vividly depict the fuzziness and randomness, a novel conversion model is proposed to transform the 2DULVs into integrated clouds. Thirdly, the extended TODIM approach is used to evaluate and rank REPs considering DMs' psychological behaviors. Following this, the Fujian case study has been provided to demonstrate to verify the feasibility of the hybrid approach. The results show that the most important criterion is the emission reduction of the greenhouse gases (GHG), and the wind power project is selected as the best alternative, but the later sensitivity analysis shows that the optimal alternative is sensitive to the attenuation factor of losses. Finally, a comparative analysis is conducted to demonstrate the correctness and superiority of the proposed approach. The originality of this work is the first time to put forward the model of transforming 2DULVS into integrated cloud.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase studies 3agreenhouse gases 3amodels 3amulti-criteria decision making 3awind power 3aChina 0aRenewable energy project 0aPerformance evaluation 0a2-dimension uncertain linguistic variables 0aCloud model 0aExtended TODIM1 aXin, He1 aYong, Huang1 aKan, Zhinan0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2019 Jan. 01, v. 206 p.1123-1137dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2018.09.0593Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03356naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002800139245012100167300001600288500002000304520197200324592002802296650001402324650002002338650001902358650002502377650000902402650001502411650001302426650001802439650002102457650003102478650001802509650001402527650001402541650002402555650001102579650002502590700002302615700002502638700002302663773013002686856007302816852000902889655001202898IND60587649920221122190632.0180102e201504  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058764992DNAL7 a10.1890/14-0545.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIacarella, Josephine C.10aEcological impacts of invasive alien species along temperature gradients: testing the role of environmental matching  ap. 706-716.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aInvasive alien species (IAS) can cause substantive ecological impacts, and the role of temperature in mediating these impacts may become increasingly significant in a changing climate. Habitat conditions and physiological optima offer predictive information for IAS impacts in novel environments. Here, using meta‐analysis and laboratory experiments, we tested the hypothesis that the impacts of IAS in the field are inversely correlated with the difference in their ambient and optimal temperatures. A meta‐analysis of 29 studies of consumptive impacts of IAS in inland waters revealed that the impacts of fishes and crustaceans are higher at temperatures that more closely match their thermal growth optima. In particular, the maximum impact potential was constrained by increased differences between ambient and optimal temperatures, as indicated by the steeper slope of a quantile regression on the upper 25th percentile of impact data compared to that of a weighted linear regression on all data with measured variances. We complemented this study with an experimental analysis of the functional response (the relationship between predation rate and prey supply) of two invasive predators (freshwater mysid shrimp, Hemimysis anomala and Mysis diluviana) across relevant temperature gradients; both of these species have previously been found to exert strong community‐level impacts that are corroborated by their functional responses to different prey items. The functional response experiments showed that maximum feeding rates of H. anomala and M. diluviana have distinct peaks near their respective thermal optima. Although variation in impacts may be caused by numerous abiotic or biotic habitat characteristics, both our analyses point to temperature as a key mediator of IAS impact levels in inland waters and suggest that IAS management should prioritize habitats in the invaded range that more closely match the thermal optima of targeted invaders.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHemimysis 3aMysis diluviana 3aclimate change 3aenvironmental impact 3afish 3afreshwater 3ahabitats 3ainland waters 3ainvasive species 3alaboratory experimentation 3ameta-analysis 3apredation 3apredators 3aregression analysis 3ashrimp 3atemperature profiles1 aDick, Jaimie T.

The origins of such compounds are often pathogenic microbes utilizing siderophores as virulence factors during host infection. The mechanism for siderophore formation typically involves the activity of nonribosomal peptide synthetases producing compounds across functional group classifications that include catecholate, phenolate, hydroxamate, and mixed categories. Though siderophore production has been a hallmark of pathogenicity, the evolutionarily-optimized binding abilities of siderophores suggest the possibility of re-directing the compounds towards alternative beneficial applications. In this mini-review, we will first describe siderophore formation origins before discussing alternative applications as pharmaceutical products. In so doing, we will cover examples and applications that include reducing metal overload, targeted antibiotic delivery, cancer treatment, vaccine development, and diagnostics. Included in this analysis will be a discussion on the native production hosts of siderophores and prospects for improvement in compound access through the adoption of heterologous biosynthesis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantibiotics 3abiosynthesis 3abiotechnology 3acancer therapy 3adiagnostic techniques 3aligases 3anonribosomal peptides 3asiderophores 3avaccine development 3avirulence1 aBruno, Michael1 aGulick, Andrew M1 aPfeifer, Blaine A.,0 tCurrent opinion in biotechnology.g2021 June, v. 69 p.242-251dElsevier LtdwJournal:11964x0958-16697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.copbio.2021.01.0213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02871naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100004200147245010200189300001400291520134100305592002801646650001301674650001201687650001701699650001001716650001401726650001301740650001101753650001101764650002201775650001301797650002001810650000901830650001101839650002001850650000901870650001201879650001101891650001601902650001601918650000901934700003001943700003601973700003602009700004902045700003202094700002102126773010402147856008102251852000902332655001202341IND60121324320221119224501.0150224e201503  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012132432DNAL7 a10.1007/s11130-014-0460-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPineli, Lívia de Lacerda de Oliveira10aUse of Baru (Brazilian Almond) Waste from Physical Extraction of Oil to Produce Gluten Free Cakes  ap. 50-55.  aThe extraction of oil from baru almonds produces a waste that carries part of their nutritional qualities and antioxidants. It can be used to produce partially deffated baru flour (PDBF). We aimed to evaluate the applicability of PDBF and the effect of the addition of xanthan gum (XG) to produce gluten free cakes. Cakes were prepared with 100 % wheat flour (WF cake) and with 100 % PDBF and four different levels of XG (0 %-PDBF cake, 0.1 %-X1, 0.2 %-X2 and 0.3 %-X3 cakes), and evaluated for composition, antioxidants, moisture, specific volume, texture and sensory acceptance. PDBF cakes showed lower carbohydrate values, but higher protein, lipids, calories and antioxidant contents. They were rich in fiber, as well as iron, zinc and copper. The replacement of WF by PDBF resulted in an increased hardness and adhesiveness and a decreased cohesiveness, elasticity and moisture. Chewiness of X2 cake was similar to that of WF cake. X2 and X3 cakes showed specific volume closer to that of WF cake. No difference was found among the treatments for texture and appearance acceptances. Flavor of X2 and X3 cakes were more accepted than WF cake. Acceptance of all cakes were in the liking region of hedonic scale. PBDF associated to XG is a feasible option to substitute WF in gluten free cake, improving its nutritional quality.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadhesion 3aalmonds 3aantioxidants 3acakes 3achewiness 3acohesion 3acopper 3aflavor 3agluten-free foods 3ahardness 3ahuman nutrition 3airon 3alipids 3anutritive value 3aoils 3atexture 3awastes 3awheat flour 3axanthan gum 3azinc1 ade Aguiar, Lorena Andrade1 ade Oliveira, Guilherme Theodoro1 aBotelho, Raquel Braz Assunção1 aIbiapina, Maria do Desterro Ferreira Pereira1 ade Lima, Herbert Cavalcanti1 aCosta, Ana Maria0 tPlant foods for human nutrition.g2015 Mar., v. 70, no. 1 p.50-55dSpringer-Verlagx0921-96687nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11130-014-0460-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03137naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002000146245011600166300002000282520188400302592002802186650001502214650001402229650001302243650002202256650002102278650001102299650001902310650001302329650000902342650001202351650001602363650002302379650001302402650002302415650001102438700002302449700002302472773012902495856008202624852000902706655001202715IND60579777220221120160839.0170831e20170831xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057977722DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.7b055542doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBurgos, Juan C.10aStructural Dependence of the Sulfur Reduction Mechanism in Carbon-Based Cathodes for Lithium–Sulfur Batteries  ap. 18369-18377.  aLithium–sulfur batteries constitute a promising energy storage technology due to their high theoretical specific capacity and energy density. However, their commercialization has been hindered due to the low cycling life of the devices caused by long chain polysulfide shuttling between electrodes, the low conductivity of sulfur, and the volumetric expansion upon sulfur reduction. Nanostructured porous carbon cathodes have been the object of extensive research due to their proven capacity to overcome the aforementioned issues, though there is still a limited understanding of the physical–chemical behavior leading to high electrochemical performances. Herein, quantum chemical calculations are used to study the effect of the structure of porous carbon cathodes on the sulfur reactivity in lithium–sulfur batteries. Ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations are initially employed to evaluate sulfur reduction mechanisms and kinetics in a confined environment. A porous cathode architecture is modeled through parallel graphene layers with elemental sulfur rings in the interlayer and filled with 1,3-dioxolane (DOL) organic solvent and lithium ions. AIMD simulations showed fast reduction of elemental sulfur and formation of short chain polysulfide. Carbon dangling bonds at the cathode edge were confirmed to enhance the reactivity through strong sulfur–carbon and lithium–carbon interactions. Furthermore, adsorption calculations through density functional theory (DFT) proved the capacity of small pores to retain long polysulfide chains, providing a complete atomistic description of the physical–chemical behavior of sulfur and polysulfide in porous cathodes of lithium–sulfur batteries. Finally, this work also demonstrates the influence of the specific current on the amount of sulfur utilization and practical specific capacity of the battery.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3abatteries 3acathodes 3acommercialization 3aelectrochemistry 3aenergy 3aenergy density 3agraphene 3aions 3alithium 3amethodology 3amolecular dynamics 3asolvents 3astorage technology 3asulfur1 aBalbuena, Perla B.1 aMontoya, Javier A.0 tThe Journal of Physical Chemistry C.g2017 Aug. 31, v. 121, no. 34 p.18369-18377dAmerican Chemical Societyx1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.jpcc.7b055543Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02806naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100006100151245013300212520131200345592002801657650001101685650001701696650001101713650001901724650001101743650001101754650002201765650001101787650002501798650000901823650001901832650001401851650001101865651001101876651001601887653002001903653003001923653002801953653001201981653001301993653001502006653001102021653001402032700001802046700002402064773011802088856008502206852000902291655001202300IND60679990520221120052324.0200103e20200101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067999052DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jenvman.2019.1097532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDoberstein, Brent1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8891-740010aManaged retreat for climate change adaptation in coastal megacities: A comparison of policy and practice in Manila and Vancouver  a‘Managed retreat’ is gaining considerable attention as part of megacities' climate change adaptation and resilience enhancement toolkits, and as a policy option for disaster risk reduction in coastal regions. The overarching objective of managed retreat is to reduce the exposure of people and assets to flooding, storm surges and sea level rise by retreating from these threats in a planned fashion. Managed retreat is one of four main options covered in the ‘PARA’ (protect/accommodate/retreat/avoid) framework explained in this paper, which can be used to enhance resilience in coastal megacities. In this paper, qualitative research methods were used to collect primary data on the feasibility of using managed retreat for two case study coastal megacities: Manila, Philippines, and Vancouver, Canada. Both case studies review the risk context of each city, local climate change adaptation/disaster risk reduction (CCA/DRR) policies linked to managed retreat, examples of managed retreat practice, and barriers to managed retreat identified through primary or secondary data analysis. Comparisons between the two cases are then carried out, and similarities and differences are highlighted. The paper concludes by suggesting possible means by which barriers to managed retreat might be overcome.  aPublisher supplied data 3aassets 3acase studies 3acities 3aclimate change 3acoasts 3afloods 3aissues and policy 3apeople 3aqualitative analysis 3arisk 3arisk reduction 3asea level 3astorms 3aCanada 3aPhilippines 0aManaged retreat 0aClimate change adaptation 0aDisaster risk reduction 0aCoastal 0aMegacity 0aResilience 0aManila 0aVancouver1 aTadgell, Anne1 aRutledge, Alexandra0 tJournal of environmental management.g2020 Jan. 01, v. 253 p.109753-dElsevier LtdwJournal:2018x0301-47977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2019.1097533Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02733naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001600140245007400156300002000230520157300250592002801823650001501851650001601866650001901882650001201901650001301913650001101926650002301937650001301960650001901973650001001992650001402002650001102016700001602027700001502043700001902058700001402077700001302091773012402104856007402228852000902302655001202311IND60660315420221120115212.0190823e20190813xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066031542DNAL7 a10.1039/c9ra04963k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShi, Jihong10aCompetitive adsorption phenomenon in shale gas displacement processes  ap. 25326-25335.  aDisplacement of methane (CH₄) by injection gas is regarded as an effective way to exploit shale gas and sequestrate carbon dioxide (CO₂) simultaneously. To remarkably enhance the rupture and extension of fractures, an original and comprehensive simplification for the real shale composition model is established to study the shale gas displacement by gas injection. In the present model, besides the consideration in the existence of organic matter in shale, the choice of silica as inorganic minerals is firstly taken into account considering its brittleness characteristic to meet the demand of fracture stretch. Based on the model, the displacement methane process and competitive adsorption behaviors were studied by using the grand canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) and molecular dynamics (MD) respectively. As the results, the strong interaction between carbon dioxide and shale results in the higher efficiency of displacing methane. We also find that the optimum operating conditions for CO₂ and N₂ displacing methane are at the pore width of 30 Å, the result being slightly different from the previous studies indicating that the displacement efficiency of small pores is higher. Moreover, the displacement efficiency by using different gases can all reach higher than 50% when the injection pressure is greater than 30 MPa. It is expected that this work can reveal the mechanisms of competitive adsorption between shale gas and gases, and provide a guidance for displacement exploitation of shale gas by gas injection and sequestration of carbon dioxide.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3abrittleness 3acarbon dioxide 3amethane 3aminerals 3amodels 3amolecular dynamics 3anitrogen 3aorganic matter 3ashale 3ashale gas 3asilica1 aGong, Liang1 aSun, Shuyu1 aHuang, Zhaoqin1 aDing, Bin1 aYao, Jun0 tRSC advances.g2019 Aug. 13, v. 9, no. 44 p.25326-25335dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c9ra04963k3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01026naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100001800112245009900130300001800229520019700247592002800444650002000472650002700492650001100519650001500530653001400545653000900559653001100568653001300579700001600592773010700608852000900715655001200724IND60709844320221119155400.0200908e201310  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070984432DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKanwar, Jyoti10aEffect of size and source of shoot tip on graft success in Citrus sinensis cv blood red plants  ap. 1417-1418.  aGood results were obtained with shoot tip from young growing flushes of potted plants.

Here we use micrometeorological observations and numerical simulations to analyze two coherent turbulent structures—a density current and a low-level jet (LLJ)—that enhance mixing and intermittent turbulence in the nocturnal boundary layer. We analyze in detail their impact on the distribution of simulated pollutant concentrations. The Weather Research and Forecast (WRF) model is coupled with the Community Multiscale Air Quality photochemical model to simulate the dispersion of pollutants for the density-current and LLJ cases. The terms of the pollutant-concentration budget are then analyzed to quantify the contribution of different atmospheric processes on the net [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text] concentrations. The results show that the WRF model reproduces successfully the essential characteristics observed in the density-current and LLJ cases. The density-current simulation shows turbulent-mixing enhancement in the frontal zone of the density current, leading to significant vertical pollutant diffusion. Results also indicate that the LLJ is able to transport pollutants from the residual layer to the surface layer due to vertical diffusion. In both cases, the main mechanism responsible for pollutant transport is the horizontal advection.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadvection 3aair quality 3acase studies 3aheat 3amixing 3amomentum 3aphotochemistry 3apollutants 3asimulation models 3aturbulent flow 3aweather1 aSoler, Maria Rosa1 aOlid, Miriam1 aJiménez-Esteve, Bernat1 aBech, Joan1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3597-74390 tBoundary-layer meteorology.g2020 Feb., v. 174, no. 2 p.203-230dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl9360x0006-83147nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10546-019-00483-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02843naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245007800163300001600241520156700257592002801824650002701852650004401879650001501923650002101938650001301959650002301972650001101995650001702006650001102023650001302034650001302047650003702060650000902097700001502106700001602121700001902137700001802156700002002174773012502194856008102319852000902400655001202409IND60477915920221123014331.0160120e201601  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6047791592DNAL7 a10.1007/s00253-015-7137-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHua, Weiwei10aBatch affinity adsorption of His-tagged proteins with EDTA-based chitosan  ap. 879-891.  aAffinity adsorption purification of hexahistidine-tagged (His-tagged) proteins using EDTA–chitosan-based adsorption was designed and carried out. Chitosan was elaborated with ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), and the resulting polymer was characterized by FTIR, TGA, and TEM. Different metals including Ni²⁺, Cu²⁺, and Zn²⁺ were immobilized with EDTA–chitosan, and their capability to the specific adsorption of His-tagged proteins were then investigated. The results showed that Ni²⁺–EDTA–chitosan and Zn²⁺–EDTA–chitosan had high affinity toward the His-tagged proteins, thus isolating them from protein mixture. The target fluorescent-labeled hexahistidine protein remained its fluorescent characteristic throughout the purification procedure when Zn²⁺–EDTA–chitosan was used as a sorbent, wherein the real-time monitor was performed to examine the immigration of fluorescent-labeled His-tagged protein. Comparatively, Zn²⁺–EDTA–chitosan showed more specific binding ability for the target protein, but with less binding capacity. It was further proved that this purification system could be recovered and reused at least for 5 times and could run on large scales. The presented M²⁺–EDTA–chitosan system, with the capability to specifically bind His-tagged proteins, make the purification of His-tagged proteins easy to handle, leaving out fussy preliminary treatment, and with the possibility of continuous processing and a reduction in operational cost in relation to the costs of conventional processes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEDTA (chelating agent) 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aadsorption 3abinding capacity 3achitosan 3acontinuous systems 3acopper 3afluorescence 3anickel 3apolymers 3aproteins 3atransmission electron microscopy 3azinc1 aLou, Yimin1 aXu, Weiyuan1 aCheng, Zhixian1 aGong, Xingwen1 aHuang, Jianying0 tApplied microbiology and biotechnology.g2016 Jan., v. 100, no. 2 p.879-891dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx0175-75987nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00253-015-7137-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01898naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003700092040001800129100001900147242003700166245004200203300001600245520073700261592002800998650002201026650001501048650001901063650001401082650001701096650001101113650001401124650001401138650001401152650001301166650002001179650001701199650001601216700003001232700002501262773010901287856008301396852000901479655001201488IND4535355120221118042630.0141112e201112  xx |||||o|||||||||||fre||7 aIND453535512DNAL7 a10.1016/j.nupar.2011.09.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSecher, Marion10aNutrition in Alzheimer's disease10aNutrition et maladie dâAlzheimer  ap. 227-232.  aDeterioration of memory function and ultimately establishment of Alzheimer's disease (AD) severely debilitates the affected individual, uncompromisingly decreasing the quality of life of both patients and their caregivers.

Part I: Biochemical oxygen demand  ap. 580-590.  aMicrobial fuel cells (MFCs) are bio-electrochemical devices, where usually the anode (but sometimes the cathode, or both) contains microorganisms able to generate and sustain an electrochemical gradient which is used typically to generate electrical power. In the more studied set-up, the anode contains heterotrophic bacteria in anaerobic conditions, capable to oxidize organic molecules releasing protons and electrons, as well as other by-products. Released protons could reach the cathode (through a membrane or not) whereas electrons travel across an external circuit originating an easily measurable direct current flow. MFCs have been proposed fundamentally as electric power producing devices or more recently as hydrogen producing devices. Here we will review the still incipient development of analytical uses of MFCs or related devices or set-ups, in the light of a non-restrictive MFC definition, as promising tools to asset water quality or other measurable parameters. An introduction to biological based analytical methods, including bioassays and biosensors, as well as MFCs design and operating principles, will also be included. Besides, the use of MFCs as biochemical oxygen demand sensors (perhaps the main analytical application of MFCs) is discussed. In a companion review (Part 2), other new analytical applications are reviewed used for toxicity sensors, metabolic sensors, life detectors, and other proposed applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanaerobic conditions 3aanalytical methods 3abacteria 3abioassays 3abiochemical oxygen demand 3abiosensors 3abyproducts 3aelectric power 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3aelectrons 3ahydrogen 3amicrobial fuel cells 3aprotons 3atoxicity 3atravel 3awater quality 0aBiosensor 0aBioassay 0aBioelectrochemisty 0aBOD 0aMFC 0aReview1 aSacco, Natalia J.1 aBonetto, Maria C.1 aHilding-Ohlsson, Astrid1 aCortón, Eduardo0 tBiosensors & bioelectronics.g2015 Jan. 15, v. 63 p.580-590dElsevier B.V.x0956-56637nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bios.2014.04.0343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02950naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245010200167300001200269520147300281592002801754596008501782650002201867650001401889650001201903650001801915650001401933650002201947650001501969650001601984650001402000650001202014650001302026650002402039650001402063650001802077650002302095651001302118700002002131700002202151700001902173700001902192700001602211700002402227773011302251856008302364852000902447655001202456IND60730306820221120151432.0220502e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073030682DNAL7 a10.1186/s13071-021-04630-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHawaria, Dawit10aSurvivorship of Anopheles gambiae sensu lato in irrigated sugarcane plantation scheme in Ethiopia  ap. 142.  aBACKGROUND: To ensure food security, sub-Saharan Africa has initiated massive water resource development projects, such as irrigated agriculture, in recent years. However, such environmental modifications affect the survivorship and development of mosquitoes, which are vectors of different diseases. This study aimed at determining the effects of irrigation practices on development and survivorship of Anopheles gambiae s.l. in Ethiopia. METHODS: A life table experiment was conducted to examine the effect of environmental modification on survivorship of both immature and adult An. gambiae s.l. in irrigated and non-irrigated areas. The pupation rate and development time of the immatures and adult longevity and fecundity were compared between the two settings. RESULTS: The estimated mean survival time of female An. gambiae s.l. in the irrigated and non-irrigated areas was 37.9 and 31.3 days, respectively. A survival analysis showed that adult females of An. gambiae s.l. placed in an irrigated area lived significantly longer than those in a non-irrigated area (χ2 = 18.3, df = 1, P <0.001), and An. gambiae s.l. females lived significantly longer than males in both areas (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Adult An. gambiae s.l. survivorship was found to be enhanced in the irrigated area compared to non-irrigated area. Longer survival of adult mosquitoes in irrigated areas could have important implications for vectorial capacity and hence malaria transmission.  aPublisher supplied data  aD43 TW001505, R01 A1050243 and U19 AI129326cNational Institutes of Health (NIH) 3aAnopheles gambiae 3afecundity 3afemales 3afood security 3aimmatures 3airrigated farming 3airrigation 3alife tables 3alongevity 3amalaria 3apupation 3aresource management 3asugarcane 3asurvival rate 3avectorial capacity 3aEthiopia1 aKibret, Solomon1 aDemissew, Assalif1 aTsegaye, Arega1 aBitew, Denekew1 aYan, Guiyun1 aYewhalaw, Delenasaw0 tParasites & vectors.g2021 Dec., v. 14, no. 1 p.142-142dBioMed CentralwJournal:jnl4347486x1756-33057nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13071-021-04630-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02118naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002400094040001800118100001800136245008600154300001600240500001500256520102500271592002801296650001601324650001001340650001101350650001901361650001601380650001701396650001001413650001001423651001801433653001801451700003201469700002401501700002001525773010601545856007201651852000901723655001201732IND60131447620221119110200.0151127e200409  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013144762DNAL7 a10.1676/04-0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLEDNEVA, ANNA10aClimate change as reflected in a naturalist's diary, middleborough, massachusetts  ap. 224-231.  a2019-12-04  aObservations by local naturalists may provide valuable records of phenological events with which we can measure the response of species to climate change. To test this idea, we examined the records of a dedicated naturalist who has been observing bird arrivals, plant flowering, butterfly appearance, and frog calling on her farm in Middleborough, southeastern Massachusetts. From her 1970 to 2002 records, we extracted data on first observations of spring phenological events for 24 species——650 observations in all. Over that time, average annual local temperatures rose by 2.0°° C. Twenty-two species showed earlier activity, with 5 of the 16 bird species now arriving significantly earlier in the year than they did 30 years ago. Twenty-two species responded to warming temperatures, with 4 species (two birds, one frog, and one plant) showing statistically significant earlier activity in years with warmer temperatures. The other 18 species showed similar trends, but they were not statistically significant.  aPublisher supplied data 3atemperature 3afarms 3aspring 3aclimate change 3abutterflies 3aAngiospermae 3afrogs 3abirds 3aMassachusetts 0aMagnoliophyta1 aMiller-Rushing, Abraham J.,1 aPRIMACK, RICHARD B.1 aIMBRES, CAROLYN0 tWilson bulletin.g2004 Sept., v. 116, no. 3 p.224-231dWilson Ornithological Societyx0043-56437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1676%2F04-0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02926naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245009900167300001800266520165300284592002801937650001601965650001801981650001701999650002002016650002402036650001702060650001302077650001902090650000702109650001302116650001202129650001402141653001902155653001602174653001502190653002402205653001702229653001702246700001602263773014402279856004802423852000902471655001202480IND50076526920221123023640.0140410e20111101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007652692DNAL7 a10.1080/109429110035927952doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYadav, Jay Kant10aStabilization of α-Amylase, the Key Enzyme in Carbohydrates Properties Alterations, at Low pH  ap. 1182-1196.  aThe present study correlates the mechanism of α-amylase denaturation under acidic condition and its structural stabilization in presence of selected cosolvents (sorbitol, sucrose, trehalose, and glycerol). The objective of the present study was to minimize the enzyme inactivation at lower pH by stabilizing the enzyme structure. The above cosolvents were found to be an effective stabilizer of α-amylase against denaturation at extreme low pH. The optimum activity of α-amylase was found to be in the pH range of 4.5 to 7. Decreasing the pH of enzyme solution below this range results in a decrease in enzyme activity. The intrinsic and ANS fluorescence indicated the gradual unfolding of protein below pH 4 and resulted in exposure of hydrophobic cluster. The pH-induced unfolding also resulted in protein aggregation. The intrinsic and 8-anilinonaphathalene-1-sulphonic acid (ANS) fluorescence, acrylamide quenching, near and far UV-CD spectra of α-amylase at lower pH (pH 2.25) indicated the complete loss of tertiary structure and substantial loss of secondary structure. Cosolvents were shown to prevent the acid induced unfolding of the enzyme to a certain extent and help in retaining the secondary structure of enzyme equivalent to native state. Among all the cosolvents used, sorbitol was proven to be the most efficient stabilizer. At lower pH, in presence of cosolvents the enzyme was shown to retain significant amount of secondary structure and poorly defined tertiary structure. This structure resembles the molten globule of the protein, which has substantial amount of secondary structure but poorly defined tertiary structure.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacrylamides 3aalpha-amylase 3adenaturation 3aenzyme activity 3aenzyme inactivation 3afluorescence 3aglycerol 3ahydrophobicity 3apH 3asorbitol 3asucrose 3atrehalose 0aMolten globule 0aAggregation 0aCosolvents 0aSecondary structure 0aDenaturation 0aFluorescence1 aPrakash, V.0 tInternational journal of food properties.g2011 Nov. 1, v. 14, no. 6 p.1182-1196dTaylor & Francis GroupwJournal:jnl56717x1094-29127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10942911003592795  aDNAL 7aarticle02630naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001600146245007500162300001600237520156300253592002801816650001101844650001201855650001101867650001401878650002101892650001901913650000901932653001701941653002401958653001501982653001701997700001602014700001902030773011802049856008002167852000902247655001202256IND60616767720221118230743.0181020e200905  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061676772DNAL7 a10.1177/00405175080999152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCho, Soomin10aFabric Sound Depends on Fiber and Stitch Types in Weft Knitted Fabrics  ap. 761-767.  aThe purpose of this study is to analyze the characteristic fast Fourier transform (FFT) spectra of weft-knitted fabrics, to investigate the relationship between sound parameters and the mechanical properties of the weft knits, and to determine the effects of fiber type and stitch type on the frictional sound and mechanical properties. The specimens included 12 weft-knitted fabrics made from a combination of 3 fiber types (100% wool, 100% cotton and 49%/51% wool/ cotton) and 4 stitch types (plain, rib, half cardigan and half milano stitch). The rustling sounds of each specimen were recorded and analyzed using FFT analysis including sound parameters such as LPT (level pressure of total sound), ΔL (level difference) and Δf (frequency difference). We also used Zwicker's psychoacoustic model to calculate the loudness (Z), sharpness (Z), roughness (Z) and fluctuation strength (Z). In addition, the mechanical properties of the specimens were measured using the Kawabata Evaluation System (KES). The FFT spectra for the weft-knitted fabrics showed different shapes according to the fiber and stitch types. Mechanical properties such as the thickness and weight were correlated with several sound parameters. Fiber type was affected by Δ f and stitch type was affected by ΔL, roughness (Z), fluctuation strength (Z) and weight. Both fiber type and stitch type were affected by tensile properties. It is possible, by changing fiber and stitch types of weft-knitted fabrics, to obtain various kinds of knitted fabrics with different frictional sounds.  aPublisher supplied data 3acotton 3afabrics 3amodels 3aroughness 3atensile strength 3atextile fibers 3awool 0afabric sound 0aweft-knitted fabric 0afiber type 0astitch type.1 aCho, Gilsoo1 aKim, Chunjeong0 tTextile research journal.g2009 May, v. 79, no. 8 p.761-767dSAGE PublicationswJournal:jnl46536x0040-51757nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/00405175080999153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02322naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100005600151245017700207520091700384592002801301650001401329650001401343650002401357650002601381650002701407650002401434650001201458650001301470650001401483650001901497653002701516653001401543653003501557653003601592653001401628700001601642700001601658700001701674773011401691856008601805852000901891655001201900IND60674194220221118144204.0200809e20200215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067419422DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhazmat.2019.1214962doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShi, Jingxin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1504-563710aEnhanced anaerobic degradation of nitrogen heterocyclic compounds with methanol, sodium citrate, chlorella, spirulina, and carboxymethylcellulose as co-metabolic substances  aThe aim of the study was to explore the feasibility of methanol, sodium citrate, chlorella, spirulina, and carboxymethylcellulose (CMC) as co-metabolic substances in strengthening the anaerobic degradation of selected nitrogen heterocyclic compounds (NHCs).

Virtual stands of European beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) across a range of structure types were stochastically generated and random sampling was simulated. We compared the bias and accuracy of stand quadratic mean diameter estimates, employing different ranks of measured stems from a set of the 10 trees nearest to the sampling point. We proposed several modifications of the original Weise’s rule based on the measurement and averaging of two different ranks centered to a target rank. In accordance with the original formulation of the empirical rule, we recommend the application of the measurement of the 6th stem in rank corresponding to the 55% sample percentile of diameter distribution, irrespective of mean diameter size and degree of diameter dispersion. The study also revealed that the application of appropriate two-measurement modifications of Weise’s method, the 4th and 8th ranks or 3rd and 9th ranks averaged to the 6th central rank, should be preferred over the classic one-measurement estimation. The modified versions are characterised by an improved accuracy (about 25%) without statistically significant bias and measurement costs comparable to the classic Weise method.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFagus sylvatica subsp. sylvatica 3aforest stands 3atrees1 aScheer, Ľubomír1 aMarušák, Róbert1 aBošeľa, Michal1 aSedmáková, Denisa1 aFabrika, Marek0 tForests.g2015 July 27, v. 6, no. 8 p.2545-2559dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2257x1999-49077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/f60825453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03049naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002700153245010800180520172900288592002802017650001702045650001702062650001602079650002102095650002502116650002302141650003002164650002202194650002902216650001202245653002102257653001702278653002302295653002002318653001502338653001502353653002102368700002202389773011902411856008802530852000902618655001202627IND60689001620221119150212.0201216e20200720xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068900162DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.1386022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBuchmann-Duck, Johanna13aAn urgent call for circular economy advocates to acknowledge its limitations in conserving biodiversity  aThis discussion paper explores the relationship between biodiversity and the circular economy and the potential implications of this relationship. The circular economy has emerged as an alternative model to a traditional linear economy. It aims to tackle the resource exploitation that accompanies a linear economy and decouple economic growth from reliance on primary resources. In the face of global environmental degradation and an urgent need for change, the concept has become popular around the world and has led to the release of national policies and strategies on the circular economy. Problematically, while the basic concept is clear, it is ambiguous in how it will achieve some of its objectives, and it fails to address some key issues. In light of the accelerating rate of change, precipitous biodiversity decline is one such key issue. Through a content analysis of relevant circular economy publications, authors demonstrate that biodiversity protection is rarely mentioned in theory and policy. While the circular economy holds many benefits for society, its evasion of scrutiny has prevented it from manifesting in a comprehensive solution to environmental issues. The circular economy advocates for biomimicry, ecosystem service valuation, bioeconomy, and renewable energy. Each of these, however, has its own set of conflicts with biodiversity protection. Given the imminent need to protect biodiversity, the authors call for further research on the interaction between biodiversity and the circular economy, and for circular economy advocates to explicitly acknowledge the concept's limitations, thereby revealing the need for intersectional and complementary policies which aim to protect biodiversity.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiodiversity 3abioeconomics 3abiomimetics 3acircular economy 3aeconomic development 3aecosystem services 3aenvironmental degradation 3aissues and policy 3arenewable energy sources 3asociety 0aCircular economy 0aBiodiversity 0aEcosystem services 0aNatural capital 0aBiomimicry 0aBioeconomy 0aRenewable energy1 aBeazley, Karen F.0 tScience of the total environment.g2020 July 20, v. 727 p.138602-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.1386023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03452naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005800148245010700206300001600313500001100329520175100340592002802091650001602119650001502135650002602150650002002176650001602196650002102212650002002233650002002253650001502273650001602288650001702304650001002321650003002331650001702361650001302378650002202391650003102413650002002444650002602464650002002490650002202510650001702532650001502549650001302564650001502577650001502592650001702607700002202624700001802646773011802664856008302782852000902865655001202874IND60701705120221122091522.0210903e202008  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070170512DNAL7 a10.1007/s12550-020-00393-w2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFouché, Tanya1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9235-313410aAflatoxins in the soil ecosystem: an overview of its occurrence, fate, effects and future perspectives  ap. 303-309.  aReview  aAflatoxins are secondary metabolites produced by specific strains of fungi, especially Aspergillus spp. These natural toxins are mainly found in soil, decaying vegetation and food storage systems and are particularly abundant during drought stress. Aflatoxin contamination is one of the most important threats to food safety and human health due to its toxic, mutagenic and carcinogenic properties. Therefore, most research focuses on post-harvest contamination of aflatoxins in feed and food commodities but very limited information is available about aflatoxin contamination and its toxicological consequences in the soil ecosystem. Current regulations provide minimal options for the disposal of aflatoxin-contaminated crops, amongst which is the incorporation of residues into the soil for natural degradation. This form of mycotoxin loading into the soil could potentially change its physicochemical characteristics and biotic parameters. Recent studies suggest that as climate conditions change, the occurrence and geographical distribution of aflatoxins might increase, posing significant health risks to the soil ecosystem, food crop production and human health. This review will focus on studies that look at the environmental and toxicological consequences of aflatoxin contamination with the aim of clarifying the risk that aflatoxin contamination poses to soil ecosystems. Many aspects of aflatoxin occurrence, degradation and the effects of its transformation products in the soil environment are still unknown and remain an important area of research for soil health and productivity. A climatic approach, in terms of changes in soil moisture and air temperature, is important for future risk assessments of aflatoxin contamination.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAspergillus 3aaflatoxins 3aagricultural products 3aair temperature 3acarcinogens 3aclimatic factors 3acrop production 3aedaphic factors 3afood crops 3afood safety 3afood storage 3afungi 3ageographical distribution 3ahuman health 3amutagens 3anatural toxicants 3aphysicochemical properties 3arisk assessment 3asecondary metabolites 3asoil ecosystems 3asoil productivity 3asoil quality 3asoil water 3atoxicity 3atoxicology 3avegetation 3awater stress1 aClaassens, Sarina1 aMaboeta, Mark0 tMycotoxin research.g2020 Aug., v. 36, no. 3 p.303-309dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:1993x0178-78887nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12550-020-00393-w3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01314naa a2200241 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002400094040001800118100002300136245005000159300001600209520057800225592002800803650001500831650001100846650001600857773010600873856007200979852000901051655001201060IND60131447920221119110554.0151127e200409  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013144792DNAL7 a10.1676/04-0422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStanley, Thomas R.10aWhen Should Mayfield Model Data be Discarded?  ap. 267-269.  aMuch confusion exists over the proper way to handle nest-fate data collected after the fledge date when using the Mayfield method.

Sulfate accepted electrons from organics at the average rate of 0.84 mol/(m³·d) through sulfate reduction, which accounted for 20.0% of the electron input rate. The remainder of the electrons derived from organics were accepted by dissolved oxygen (2.6%), nitrate (26.8%), and iron(III) (39.9%). The sulfide produced from sulfate reduction was transformed into acidvolatile sulfide, pyrite, and elemental sulfur, which were deposited in the substratum, storing electrons in the microcosm at the average rate of 0.52 mol/(m³·d). In the presence of nitrate, the acid-volatile and elemental sulfur were oxidized to sulfate, donating electrons at the average rate of 0.14 mol/(m³.d) and driving autotrophic denitrification at the average rate of 0.30 g N/(m³·d). The overall electron transfer efficiency of the sulfur cycle for autotrophic denitrification was 15.3%. A mass balance assessment indicated that approximately 50% of the input sulfur was discharged from the microcosm, and the remainder was removed through deposition (49%) and plant uptake (1%). Dominant sulfatereducing (i.e., Desulfovirga, Desulforhopalus, Desulfatitalea, and Desulfatirhabdium) and sulfuroxidizing bacteria (i.e., Thiohalobacter, Thiobacillus, Sulfuritalea, and Sulfurisoma), which jointly fulfilled a sustainable sulfur cycle, were identified. These results improved understanding of electron transfers among carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur cycles in constructed wetlands, and are of engineering significance.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDesulforhopalus 3aDesulfovirga 3aThiobacillus 3abacteria 3acarbon 3aconstructed wetlands 3adenitrification 3adissolved oxygen 3aelectron transfer 3aelectrons 3airon 3anitrates 3anitrogen 3aoxidation 3apyrite 3asulfates 3asulfur1 aWen, Yue1 aChen, Yi1 aZhou, Qi0 tFrontiers of environmental science & engineering.g2020 Aug., v. 14, no. 4 p.57-57dHigher Education PresswJournal:J000001686x2095-22017nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11783-020-1236-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04817naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001600152245010000168300001200268520342900280592002803709650001303737650001403750650001503764650001503779650001103794650002003805650001303825650003403838650002503872650001003897650001003907650000803917650002003925650001203945650001803957650001703975650001203992650001604004650000904020650001604029650001704045650001404062650001804076700002004094773010204114856008604216852000904302655001204311IND60630874920221120144430.0190214e201312  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063087492DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cryobiol.2013.09.0292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWowk, Brian10a023 Adaptation of a commercial diathermy machine for radiofrequency warming of vitrified organs  ap. 404.  aElectromagnetic warming of vitrified tissue is superior to external conduction for rapidly and uniformly traversing the temperature zone of maximum ice growth where risk of devitrification is greatest. The temperature zone where previously-nucleated ice crystals grow most rapidly typically spans tens of degrees Celsius below the melting temperature, above which ice cannot exist, and below which ice growth is kinetically inhibited by viscosity. The frequency used for electromagnetic warming should be chosen to couple well to the cryoprotectant solution in this temperature zone, while coupling poorly at higher temperatures. Such a frequency will cause rapid passage through the ice growth temperature zone and then cause warm spots to loiter above the melting temperature while colder parts of the organ catch up, thereby avoiding thermal runaway. For the M22 vitrification solution that has been used for rabbit kidney vitrification in our laboratory, the temperature zone of rapid ice growth is approximately −75°C to −60°C. The solution viscosity in this temperature zone is very high, with a Debye dipole relaxation frequency on the order of 10MHz. This suggested an electromagnetic warming frequency much lower than the hundreds of megahertz typically studied in cryobiology. A Magnatherm 1000 (International Medical Electronics, Ltd.) diathermy machine providing ∼200W of RF power at 27MHz was modified for dielectric warming of 20mL samples. The diathermy treatment head consisting of a resonant series capacitor and wire coil for induction heating was disassembled and modified by replacing the capacitor with a custom fabricated sample holder composed of two opposed aluminum plates (5cm×4cm curved plates making a cylindrical space of 4.5cm diameter and 4cm height between them), and by adding delay lines and variable inductance for tuning purposes. The Magnatherm control console conveniently includes a net forward voltage display that allowed manual tuning of the variable inductance during sample warming without any other instrumentation. Samples of vitrification solution, or rabbit kidneys in vitrification solution, were placed in 20mL glass vials or 20mL polyethylene specimen containers of 3cm diameter surrounded by foam insulating sleeves of 1.25cm thickness. Temperatures during warming were measured by a Luxtron 790 Fluoroptic Thermometer, and temperature uniformity after warming was assessed by measurements at multiple positions inside and outside kidneys using a thermocouple needle probe. M22 solutions used during temperature uniformity measurements were gelled by the addition of 5% hydroxyethyl cellulose to inhibit convection during warming. During warming of vitrified 20mL samples of M22 in LM5 (low ionic carrier solution), a peak warming rate of 160°C/min was observed at −55°C (the melting point), declining to only 20°C/min at −25°C. Warming time between −90°C and −40°C was 30s. At the end of warming the coldest point in the solution was −28°C (bottom) and warmest point was−25°C (middle). Vitrified kidneys were found to warm approximately half as fast as solutions of the same volume, with temperatures of 39°C in the medulla and −21°C in the cortex after 3min of warming from −100°C.Source of funding: This research was supported by 21st Century Medicine, Inc. and University of Seville.Conflict of interest: None declared.wowk@21cm.com  aPublisher supplied data 3aaluminum 3acellulose 3acontainers 3aconvection 3acortex 3acryoprotectants 3acrystals 3aelectric potential difference 3aelectrical equipment 3afoams 3aglass 3aice 3ainstrumentation 3akidneys 3amelting point 3apolyethylene 3arabbits 3aradio waves 3arisk 3atemperature 3athermometers 3aviscosity 3avitrification1 aCorral, Ariadna0 tCryobiology.g2013 Dec., v. 67, no. 3 p.404-404dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl45487x0011-22407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cryobiol.2013.09.0293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02040naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002300146245010300169300001600272520083500288592002801123650001601151650001801167650001701185650001701202650001301219650001601232650001901248650003101267653002301298653002101321653001101342653002201353700002501375700001801400700001701418773011801435856008001553852000901633655001201642IND60616767920221118230925.0181020e200905  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061676792DNAL7 a10.1177/00405175080999202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSahin, Umut Kivanc10aOptimization of Ionic Crosslinking Process: An Alternative to Conventional Durable Press Finishing  ap. 744-752.  aCotton fiber has a natural tendency to wrinkle. In order to overcome this undesired property several durable press finishes were proposed and have been used for a long while. However, most of these chemical finishes release formaldehyde, a suspected human carcinogen, which causes fabric to lose strength and to yellow. Non-formaldehyde alternatives to these finishes are expensive. Thus, a non-formaldehyde finish prepared by using common and more available chemicals is required. In this study, we prepared anionic cotton fabric and further treated it with a novel crosslinker, namely cationic glycerin. We focused on optimizing an ionic crosslinking process in terms of the treated fabric's wrinkle recovery angle (WRA). Our results showed that high WRA results may be achieved and the strength of fabric may also be increased.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarcinogens 3acotton fabric 3acrosslinking 3aformaldehyde 3aglycerol 3alint cotton 3atextile fibers 3awrinkle resistant finishes 0aionic crosslinking 0awrinkle recovery 0acotton 0acationic glycerin1 aGursoy, Nevin Cigdem1 aHauser, Peter1 aSmith, Brent0 tTextile research journal.g2009 May, v. 79, no. 8 p.744-752dSAGE PublicationswJournal:jnl46536x0040-51757nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/00405175080999203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03519naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001400139245010300153300001400256500002000270520170100290592002801991596005902019596007502078596006202153596006102215650001502276650001602291650002002307650001702327650002002344650001802364650001802382650001402400650001702414650002302431650002702454650002602481650001402507650001202521650003002533650001202563650001102575650002502586650001502611650002202626700001602648700001302664700001202677700005202689773013002741856007302871852000902944655001202953IND60742141320221116190222.0210623e202107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074214132DNAL7 a10.1111/jam.149612doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, X.10aSpatial and temporal organization of jejunal microbiota in goats during animal development process  ap. 68-79.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aAIMS: This research aimed to investigate the temporal bacterial colonization relating to non‐rumination, transition and rumination phases, together with the spatial organization of microbial community in the jejunal mucosa and digesta of goats. METHODS AND RESULTS: This study explored the colonization programme of the jejunal microbiota by employing 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing. The colonization pattern of jejunal bacterial community exhibited an age‐ and gut region‐dependent progression during animal development process. Approximately 268 bacterial signatures contributed to the discrimination between gut regions, with Lactobacillus, Ruminococcus, Eubacterium and Clostridium_sensu_stricto were enriched in the jejunal digesta, and Bacteroides and unclassified bacteria were enriched in the jejunal mucosa. Intriguingly, a shift from Lactobacillus to Butyrivibrio, Eubacterium and Ruminococcus after d 20 was observed for jejunal digesta. In mucosa, Bifidobacterium, Corynebacterium, Faecalibacterium and Roseburia increased with age (P < 0·05) while Arcobacter, Bacteroides and Porphyromonas peaked at d 10. CONCLUSIONS: The jejunal bacterial community was settled after solid starter provision, which may mark the potential boundary of a timeframe for intervention in goats. The spatial heterogeneity highlighted the complicacy of ecological niches during manipulation of gut microbiota. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The present study extended the understanding of microbial programming and niche specific in the jejunum among different life stages and the basal cognition of persistent enhancement of nutrient utilization and decline of enteric diseases in ruminants.  aPublisher supplied data  a31601967cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a2017NK1020cMajor Project for Science and Technology of Hunan Province  a2017QNCXTD_ZCScYouth Innovation Team Project of ISA, CAS  a2019RS3021cConstruction of Innovative in Hunan Province 3aArcobacter 3aBacteroides 3aBifidobacterium 3aButyrivibrio 3aCorynebacterium 3aLactobacillus 3aPorphyromonas 3aRoseburia 3aRuminococcus 3aanimal development 3abacterial colonization 3abacterial communities 3acognition 3adigesta 3aintestinal microorganisms 3ajejunum 3amucosa 3anutrient utilization 3arumination 3aspatial variation1 aWu-O, Jess,1 aZhou, C.1 aTan, Z.1 aJiao, J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6064-22700 tJournal of applied microbiology.g2021 July, v. 131, no. 1 p.68-79dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl54923x1364-50727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jam.149613Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02640naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001900152245011700171300001600288520153300304592002801837650002001865650002501885650001101910650002201921650002401943650001701967650001301984650002401997651001302021700001802034700001702052700002502069773008902094856008602183852000902269655001202278IND60086322620221119215548.0141101e20111115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008632262DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecolecon.2011.08.0202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTravers, Henry10aIncentives for cooperation: The effects of institutional controls on common pool resource extraction in Cambodia  ap. 151-161.  aCooperation among humans is highly dependent on social and institutional conditions, with individual incentives playing a key role in determining the level of cooperation achieved. Understanding the conditions under which cooperation can emerge has important implications for the design of resource management and wildlife conservation interventions. Incentive-based conservation approaches are being widely implemented, yet very few studies test the role of incentives in promoting cooperation in relevant developing country contexts. Using a common pool resource game, in four villages in Cambodia, we investigated how the level of within-group cooperation varies under different institutional arrangements, including opportunities for social approval, external enforcement of rules and individual and collective incentive payments. Our results demonstrate the significance of self-organisation, the ability to devise, monitor and enforce a set of rules, among resource users. Treatments which promoted self-organisation had the greatest effect in reducing individual extraction, achieved the greatest efficiencies and had the strongest interaction with group decision-making in reducing extraction. The effects of these treatments carried over to reduce extraction in subsequent treatments, irrespective of their institutional arrangements. These results suggest that policies designed to incentivise certain behaviour in local stakeholder groups may be more successful if they create opportunities for local decision-making.  aPublisher supplied data 3adecision making 3adeveloping countries 3ahumans 3aissues and policy 3aresource management 3astakeholders 3avillages 3awildlife management 3aCambodia1 aClements, Tom1 aKeane, Aidan1 aMilner-Gulland, E.J.0 tEcological economics.g2011 Nov. 15, v. 71 p.151-161dElsevier B.V.x0921-80097nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolecon.2011.08.0203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03219naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245007500164300001100239500001100250520161000261592002801871650001501899650001101914650003501925650002401960650001501984650001701999650000902016650002002025650002402045650002702069650001302096650001702109650001302126650001102139650001402150650001402164650001502178650002202193650001602215650002802231650001502259650002502274700001302299700001502312700001402327700001402341700001502355700001702370700001502387773014802402856008202550852000902632655001202641IND60687791520221117013952.0210113e202008  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068779152DNAL7 a10.1007/s11783-020-1235-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Xinjie10aMagnetotactic bacteria: Characteristics and environmental applications  ap. 56.  aReview  aMagnetotactic bacteria (MTB) are a group of Gram-negative prokaryotes that respond to the geomagnetic field. This unique property is attributed to the intracellular magnetosomes, which contains membrane-bound nanocrystals of magnetic iron minerals. This review summarizes the most recent advances in MTB, magnetosomes, and their potential applications especially the environmental pollutant control or remediation. The morphologic and phylogenetic diversity of MTB were first introduced, followed by a critical review of isolation and cultivation methods. Researchers have devoted to optimize the factors, such as oxygen, carbon source, nitrogen source, nutrient broth, iron source, and mineral elements for the growth of MTB. Besides the applications of MTB in modern biological and medical fields, little attention was made on the environmental applications of MTB for wastewater treatment, which has been summarized in this review. For example, applications of MTB as adsorbents have resulted in a novel magnetic separation technology for removal of heavy metals or organic pollutants in wastewater. In addition, we summarized the current advance on pathogen removal and detection of endocrine disruptor which can inspire new insights toward sustainable engineering and practices. Finally, the new perspectives and possible directions for future studies are recommended, such as isolation of MTB, genetic modification of MTB for mass production and new environmental applications. The ultimate objective of this review is to promote the applications of MTB and magnetosomes in the environmental fields.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorbents 3acarbon 3aendocrine-disrupting chemicals 3agenetic engineering 3ageophysics 3aheavy metals 3airon 3amagnetic fields 3amagnetic separation 3amagnetotactic bacteria 3aminerals 3ananocrystals 3anitrogen 3aoxygen 3apathogens 3aphylogeny 3apollutants 3aprokaryotic cells 3aremediation 3asustainable engineering 3awastewater 3awastewater treatment1 aLi, Yang1 aZhao, Jian1 aYao, Hong1 aChu, Siqi1 aSong, Zimu1 aHe, Zongxian1 aZhang, Wen0 tFrontiers of environmental science & engineering.g2020 Aug., v. 14, no. 4 p.56-56dHigher Education PresswJournal:J000001686x2095-22017nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11783-020-1235-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02728naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002200139245007100161300001800232520146700250592002801717650001301745650001401758650001301772650001201785650001901797650001101816650003301827650002101860650001901881653001001900653001301910653001401923653002201937653002101959653001001980700002201990700002102012700001902033700002202052773012402074856007502198852000902273655001202282IND60527462220221120195020.0160715e20130710xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052746222DNAL7 a10.1021/am400839n2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGillies, Andrew G10aDry Self-Cleaning Properties of Hard and Soft Fibrillar Structures  ap. 6081-6088.  aRecently, gecko-inspired synthetic adhesives (GSAs) have been made using a variety of fabrication techniques and materials, with one made from a hard polymer having been reported to recover its shear adhesion after fouling by normal use, or “dry self-clean”, a feature useful for applications in wall crawling robots, reusable adhesives, microfabrication and solar panel cleaning. This paper investigates the impact of two design parameters on the dry self-cleaning capability of GSAs by experimentally testing two GSAs after fouling with small (1 μm), medium (3–10 μm), and large (40–50 μm) particles. We found that a GSA made from a hard thermoplastic with nanoscopic fibers was able to recover 96–115% of its shear adhesion after fouling with small and large but not medium particles, while a GSA made from a soft polymer and microscopic fibers recovered 40–55% on medium and large particles, with SEM imaging revealing particles embedding within the polymer. An analysis of the contact strength between fibers, particles and substrates of various dimensions and elasticity reveals that dry self-cleaning will be more effective for GSAs fabricated with smaller fiber diameters and for GSAs fabricated from materials with smaller loss functions, such as hard thermoplastics. These results have important implications on the choice of materials and geometries used for GSAs when dry self-cleaning capability is a desired function in the material.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadhesion 3aadhesives 3acleaning 3afouling 3aimage analysis 3arobots 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asolar collectors 3athermoplastics 0agecko 0aadhesive 0afibrillar 0adry self-cleaning 0aparticle contact 0ashear1 aPuthoff, Jonathan1 aCohen, Michael J1 aAutumn, Kellar1 aFearing, Ronald

In the FAO's 2012 ‘State of the World's Fisheries and Aquaculture’ report, the authors ‘hoped’ the reductions in landings were partially due to management implementation rather than population decline. Here, we tested their hypothesis. Post‐peak chondrichthyan landings trajectories from 126 countries were modelled against seven indirect and direct fishing pressure measures and eleven measures of fisheries management performance, while accounting for ecosystem attributes. We found the recent improvement in international or national fisheries management was not yet strong enough to account for the recent decline in chondrichthyan landings. Instead, the landings declines were more closely related to fishing pressure and ecosystem attribute measures. Countries with the greatest declines had high human coastal population sizes or high shark and ray meat exports such as Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Thailand. While important progress had been made, country‐level fisheries management measures did not yet have the strength or coverage to halt overfishing and avert population declines of chondrichthyans. Increased implementation of legally binding operational fisheries management and species‐specific reporting is urgently required to avoid declines and ensure fisheries sustainability and food security.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFood and Agriculture Organization 3aaquaculture 3achimerism 3aecosystems 3afisheries management 3afood security 3ahumans 3ameat 3aoverfishing 3apopulation dynamics 3apopulation size 3asharks 3aPakistan 3aSri Lanka 3aThailand1 aKrawchuk, Meg A1 aDulvy, Nicholas K0 tFish and fisheries.g2016 June, v. 17, no. 2 p.438-458dBlackwell Sciencex1467-29607nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/faf.121193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01858naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001700139245013400156300001800290520061100308592002800919650001100947650001800958650001900976650001900995650001201014650001401026653002401040653001601064653002201080653002801102653002801130700001701158700001801175700001701193700001501210700001601225773012301241856007501364852000901439655001201448IND60527440420221120155046.0160715e20130522xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052744042DNAL7 a10.1021/am40074842doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLu, Yongchun10aEffect of Photogenerated Charge Transfer on the Photocatalysis in High-Performance Hybrid Pt–Co:ZnO Nanostructure Photocatalyst  ap. 4017-4020.  aHybrid Pt–Co:ZnO nanostructure photocatalysts were prepared via a facile two-step synthetic strategy.

In this study, three different 16S rRNA gene molecular analysis methodologies were employed to screen bacterial pathogens in samples collected at three different stages of an activated sludge plant. Overall bacterial diversity was analyzed using next generation sequencing (NGS) on the Illumina MiSeq platform, as well as PCR-DGGE followed by band sequencing. In addition, a microdiversity analysis was conducted using PCR-DGGE, targeting Escherichia coli. Bioinformatics analysis was performed using QIIME protocol by clustering sequences against the Human Pathogenic Bacteria Database. NGS data were also clustered against the Greengenes database for a genera-level diversity analysis. NGS proved to be the most effective approach screening the sequences of 21 potential human bacterial pathogens, while the E. coli microdiversity analysis yielded one (O157:H7 str. EDL933) out of the two E. coli strains picked up by NGS. Overall diversity using PCR-DGGE did not yield any pathogenic sequence matches even though a number of sequences matched the NGS results. Overall, sequences of Gram-negative pathogens decreased in relative abundance along the treatment train while those of Gram-positive pathogens increased.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aactivated sludge 3aanimal pathogenic bacteria 3abioinformatics 3adatabases 3agenes 3ahigh-throughput nucleotide sequencing 3ahumans 3amonitoring 3amunicipal wastewater 3apublic health 3aribosomal RNA 3arisk 3ascreening 3astandard operating procedures 3awastewater treatment 3awater reuse1 aAmha, Yamrot

However, morphological deformities have been frequently observed in reared leptocephali and glass eels. We examined the effect of water current velocities (5.7–8.3 cm/s) on the body size and morphology of reared leptocephali and metamorphosed glass eels. As the current velocity increased, the size of leptocephali became smaller and the occurrence rate of notochord curvature increased. However, even in low velocities, water current had a long-term negative impact on their morphology. Sixty-five percent of metamorphosed glass eels had one of the eight types of vertebral deformities: compression, luxation, fusion, brachyspina, modification, lordosis, kyphosis, or scoliosis. Although their occurrence rate was unrelated to current velocity, there was a tendency for some deformities to be localised in a certain area of the vertebral column. In particular, compression frequently occurred in caudal vertebrae in faster currents. Most vertebral deformities began before the completion of metamorphosis. Therefore, appropriate management of the water current during the leptocephalus stage is important for establishing mass production of morphologically normal glass eels.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAnguilla japonica 3abody size 3aeel 3aleptocephalus larvae 3ametamorphosis 3arearing 3ascoliosis 3aseedlings 3avertebrae 3awater currents 3awater management1 aOkamura, Akihiro1 aTakeuchi, Aya1 aTsukamoto, Katsumi0 tFisheries science.g2016 Nov., v. 82, no. 6 p.941-951dSpringer Japanx0919-92687nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12562-016-1015-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03436naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245009200171520182000263592002802083650001502111650001902126650001502145650002902160650001902189650001102208650002202219650001502241650001802256650002002274650001002294650001302304650001602317650001402333650001702347650002202364650002302386650001002409650002202419650001502441650001102456650001102467650001502478650001302493653002202506653001102528700002202539700001702561700002302578700002102601700002002622773012202642856008502764852000902849655001202858IND60676134020221120073055.0191214e20200130xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067613402DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecoenv.2019.1099402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCarotenuto, Rosa10aImpact of copper in Xenopus laevis liver: Histological damages and atp7b downregulation  aCopper is an essential micronutrient but its excess in the dietary can be toxic. Both copper deficiency and abundance can occur in natural conditions and can lead to pathological dysfunctions. Many of the toxic effects of copper, such as increased lipid peroxidation in cell membranes and DNA damage, are due to its role in the generation of oxygen free radicals. Copper is released into the environment by both natural sources and human activities and it can damage organisms and ecosystems. In the present work the effects of copper has been studied on Xenopus laevis, an interesting model organism, after three weeks of exposure at 1 mg/L of CuCl, concentration allowed in the water for human use. The effects of this metal were analysed on the liver at light microscope by Hematoxylin-Eosin, Mallory, Pas and Perls stainings to evaluate the general histology, the glycogen metabolism and presence of hemosiderin. Moreover the number and area of melanomoacrophages, known as inflammation parameters, were assessment. Finally, we investigated the expression of atp7b gene and localization of respective ATP7B protein, the membrane protein involved in Cu detoxication. The achieved results showed that copper, even at a low concentration, causes serious histological alterations of liver. It induces an increase in the size and number of melanomacrophages and higher amount of hemosiderin in the treated than controls. Moreover, it alters the gene expression and localization of ATP7B protein. The data are indicative that an exposition at low and chronic concentration of copper in Xenopus laevis damages seriously the liver. For this reason it's important to consider this metal one of the pollutants involved in the decline of the amphibians and for its possible effects in other vertebrates including humans.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA damage 3aXenopus laevis 3aamphibians 3aanthropogenic activities 3acell membranes 3acopper 3acopper deficiency 3aecosystems 3afree radicals 3agene expression 3agenes 3aglycogen 3ahemosiderin 3ahistology 3ainflammation 3alight microscopes 3alipid peroxidation 3aliver 3amembrane proteins 3ametabolism 3amodels 3aoxygen 3apollutants 3atoxicity 0aMelanomacrophages 0aatp7b.1 aCapriello, Teresa1 aCofone, Rita1 aGaldiero, Giuseppe1 aFogliano, Chiara1 aFerrandino, Ida0 tEcotoxicology and environmental safety.g2020 Jan. 30, v. 188 p.109940-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:1984x0147-65137nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoenv.2019.1099403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02867naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001500148245014700163300001600310520151900326592002801845650001501873650001701888650002001905650002601925650002101951650001501972650000901987650001701996650001802013650001302031650001302044653001602057653002502073653002102098653002502119653001702144653001702161700001202178700001802190700001402208773009602222856008202318852000902400655001202409IND60091659120221116144524.0161021e20130715xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009165912DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bios.2013.01.0702doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLin, Dajie10aSignal amplification for electrochemical immunosensing by in situ assembly of host–guest linked gold nanorod superstructure on immunocomplex  ap. 195-200.  aAn amplification strategy for signal tracing was developed by introducing a host–guest binding reaction into the assembly process of gold nanorods (AuNRs) superstructure. The amplification pathway firstly used a thio-β-cyclodextrin (SH-β-CD) functionalized gold nanoparticles to label signal antibody, and then in situ assembled multi-layer SH-β-CD end-functionalized AuNRs to sandwich immunocomplex on immunosensor surface by using 4,4,4,4-(21H, 23H-porphine-5,10,15,20-tetrayl) tetrakis (benzoic acid) as a bridge to achieve simple and convenient host–guest reaction. The built end-to-end AuNRs superstructure showed excellent performance for the signal amplification in connection with the electrochemical biosensing by preoxidation and then voltammetric analysis of gold element. Using α-fetoprotein as an analyte, the immunosensor was constructed by covalently binding capture antibody to chitosan–carbon nanotubes-poly(diallyldimethylammonium chloride) modified electrode. The superstructure rich in AuNRs brought an enhanced detection sensitivity of protein, which could detect α-fetoprotein in a linear range from 0.5pg mL−1 to 0.5ng mL−1 with a detection limit down to 0.032pg mL−1. The immunoassay exhibited good stability and acceptable reproducibility and accuracy. The in situ superstructure assembly could be extended to other labeled recognition systems, providing a promising novel avenue for signal amplification and potential applications in bioanalysis and clinical diagnostics.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantibodies 3abenzoic acid 3adetection limit 3adiagnostic techniques 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3agold 3aimmunoassays 3aimmunosensors 3ananogold 3ananorods 0aImmunoassay 0aSignal amplification 0aElectrochemistry 0aHost–guest linking 0aGold nanorod 0aTumor marker1 aWu, Jie1 aJu, Huangxian1 aYan, Feng0 tBiosensors & bioelectronics.g2013 July 15, v. 45 p.195-200dElsevier B.V.x0956-56637nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bios.2013.01.0703Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04223naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100006000145245014400205300001600349500002000365520280900385592002803194650001703222650002403239650002603263650002103289650001103310650002603321650002203347650001103369650001603380650001603396650001303412651001103425700002503436700001803461700005503479700005903534773011903593856008003712852000903792655001203801IND60589297720221122141644.0180619e201803  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058929772DNAL7 a10.1111/1365-2745.128162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLachmuth, Susanne1http://orcid.org/0000-0002-4027-763210aNeighbourhood effects on plant reproduction: An experimental–analytical framework and its application to the invasive Senecio inaequidens  ap. 761-773.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aDensity dependence is of fundamental importance for population and range dynamics. Density‐dependent reproduction of plants arises from competitive and facilitative plant–plant interactions that can be pollination independent or pollination mediated. In small and sparse populations, conspecific density dependence often turns from negative to positive and causes Allee effects. Reproduction may also increase with heterospecific density (community‐level Allee effect), but the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood and the consequences for community dynamics can be complex. Allee effects have crucial consequences for the conservation of declining species, but also the dynamics of range edge populations. In invasive species, Allee effects may slow or stop range expansion. Observational studies in natural plant communities cannot distinguish whether reproduction is limited by pollination‐mediated interactions among plants or by other neighbourhood effects (e.g. competition for abiotic resources). Even experimental pollen supply cannot distinguish whether variation in reproduction is caused by direct density effects or by plant traits correlated with density. Finally, it is unknown over which spatial scales pollination‐mediated interactions occur. To circumvent these problems, we introduce a comprehensive experimental and analytical framework which simultaneously (1) manipulates pollen availability and quality by hand pollination and pollinator exclusion, (2) manipulates neighbourhoods by transplanting target plants, and (3) analyses the effects of con‐ and heterospecific neighbourhoods on reproduction with spatially explicit trait‐based neighbourhood models. Applying this framework to Senecio inaequidens, one of Europe's fastest plant invaders, we found that the seed set was strongly pollen limited. Reproduction had increased by pollinator‐mediated facilitation by both con‐ and heterospecific neighbours which may lead to (community‐level) Allee effects. Pollination‐independent interactions, such as amelioration of abiotic conditions through neighbours, contributed to additional positive neighbour effects. However, these pollination‐independent interactions were weaker than the pollination‐mediated interactions and they occurred over smaller spatial scales. Finally, the strength and direction of neighbourhood effects depended on neighbour traits and thus changed with the trait composition of the neighbourhood. Synthesis. By manipulating both pollen availability and target plant locations within neighbourhoods, we can comprehensively analyse spatially explicit density dependence of plant reproduction. This experimental approach enhances our ability to understand the dynamics of sparse populations and of species geographical ranges.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAllee effect 3aSenecio inaequidens 3aenvironmental factors 3ainvasive species 3amodels 3aobservational studies 3aplant communities 3apollen 3apollination 3apollinators 3aseed set 3aEurope1 aHenrichmann, Colette1 aHorn, Juliane1 aPagel, Jörn1http://orcid.org/0000-0002-4817-19201 aSchurr, Frank M.1http://orcid.org/0000-0002-4518-06020 tjournal of ecology.g2018 Mar., v. 106, no. 2 p.761-773dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl44660x0022-04777nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1365-2745.128163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02638naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002300139245009200162300001600254520148400270592002801754650002101782650001401803650002501817650001501842650000901857650001601866700001801882700002301900700002101923700001701944700001901961700001701980700002401997700001902021700002302040773009502063856007302158852000902231655001202240IND60519329520221119105016.0160426e201606  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051932952DNAL7 a10.1111/faf.121212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHillary, Richard M12aA scientific alternative to moratoria for rebuilding depleted international tuna stocks  ap. 469-482.  aThere is considerable international concern and scientific debate about the current state and future of tuna stocks worldwide and the capacity of Regional Fisheries Management Organisations to manage the associated fisheries effectively. In some cases, this concern has extended to predictions of imminent collapse with minimal chances of recovery, even under a commercial catch moratorium. As a viable alternative to a full fishery closure, the Commission for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna (CCSBT) has adopted a scientifically tested, adaptive rebuilding strategy for the depleted southern bluefin tuna (Thunnus maccoyii) stock. The management procedure (MP) adopted involves a harvest control rule that fully specifies the total allowable catch as a function of key indicators of stock status, adjusting future harvest levels every three years so as to meet the rebuilding targets agreed by CCSBT. It was chosen from a subset of candidate MPs selected following extensive simulation testing. This involved first selecting a wide range of plausible scenarios for stock status and input data, ranging from pessimistic to optimistic, against which the alternative candidate MPs were tested to ensure that they were robust to important uncertainties. This is the first time that a comprehensively evaluated MP has been adopted for an internationally managed tuna stock. Both the process and the outcomes have broad applicability to other internationally managed stocks.  aPublisher supplied data 3aThunnus maccoyii 3afisheries 3afisheries management 3aprediction 3atuna 3auncertainty1 aPreece, Ann L1 aDavies, Campbell R1 aKurota, Hiroyuki1 aSakai, Osamu1 aItoh, Tomoyuki1 aParma, Ana M1 aButterworth, Doug S1 aIanelli, James1 aBranch, Trevor A.,0 tFish and fisheries.g2016 June, v. 17, no. 2 p.469-482dBlackwell Sciencex1467-29607nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/faf.121213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02868naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001600148245015100164300001200315500001900327520161500346592002801961650001501989650001102004650002202015650001202037650002502049650002602074650001402100650001402114650001102128650001602139650001502155651001002170700002102180700001302201700001702214773013502231856008302366852000902449655001202458IND60701705620221122091508.0200722e202007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070170562DNAL7 a10.1007/s12665-020-09104-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVandana, M.10aEnvironmental impact of quarrying of building stones and laterite blocks: a comparative study of two river basins in Southern Western Ghats, India  ap. 366.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aMining and quarrying for minor minerals impart significant economic, environmental and social impacts in and around the affected areas. The problem is severe in the small river catchments as the effective area available for assimilating negative impacts of the activity is minimal, compared to large river basins. To address these issues, an investigation has been carried out in two river basins of southern Western Ghats (India)—the Netravati–Gurpur and Periyar–Chalakudy river basins. Both these basins host two important port cities of south India—Kochi and Mangalore. The study reveals that about 6.75 × 10⁶ ty⁻¹ of hard rocks are being extracted in the Netravati–Gurpur basin through 64 quarries. At the same time, the total number of quarries and extracted amounts in the Periyar–Chalakudy river basin are 525 and 10.47 × 10⁶ ty⁻¹, respectively. Many hillocks in the region are turned to a cluster of ugly scars, degrading the ecology and aesthetics of the area. Lowering of water table, modification or disappearance of natural drainages and environmental pollution are some of the other observations noticed in the area. The environmental impacts of laterite quarrying are comparatively less than that of rock quarrying as removal of the hard laterite cap rock enhances water percolation and makes the area more irrigable for agriculture. The study stresses the need for environment-friendly quarrying alternatives with stringent guidelines to improve the overall environmental quality of the area on one hand and to meet the developmental requirements on the other.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaesthetics 3abasins 3acomparative study 3aecology 3aenvironmental impact 3aenvironmental quality 3alaterites 3apollution 3arivers 3awater table 3awatersheds 3aIndia1 aJohn, Shiekha E.1 aMaya, K.1 aPadmalal, D.0 tEnvironmental earth sciences.g2020 July, v. 79, no. 14 p.366-366dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:J000001228x1866-62807nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12665-020-09104-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02285naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002900145245009500174300001600269506002800285520104200313592002801355506003701383650002601420650001001446650001401456650001001470650001301480650001201493650001801505650002501523650001601548650002101564653002201585653002101607653002201628773014801650856008001798852000901878655001201887IND60775017420221207071554.0161223e201412  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077501742DNAL7 a10.20543/mkkp.v30i2.1312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKasmudjiastuti, Emiliana10aOptimasi proses finishing kulit ikan nila (Oreochromis niloticus) untuk bagian atas sepatu  ap. 107-114.  aResource is Open Access  aThe aims of this study was to get the optimum finishing formulations of tilapia fish skin for shoe upper.

The results showed that the optimum formula for finishing were performed by a variation of binder 1:2, lacquer water 1:2, temperature of plating 95°C and time of plating 1.5 seconds, and it was characterized by the physical properties of tensile strength 177.32 kg/cm2, elongation at break 62%, tear strength 41.92 kg/cm, stitch strength 113.06 kg/cm, softness 2.33 and generally met the standard requirements of SNI 0253:2009: Footwear upper leather - goat skin.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aOreochromis niloticus 3acolor 3afish skin 3agoats 3ahardness 3aleather 3alinear models 3astatistical analysis 3atemperature 3atensile strength 0atilapia fish skin 0aaqueous top coat 0aleather finishing0 tMajalah kulit, karet, dan plastik.g2014 Dec., v. 30, no. 2 p.107-114dCenter for Leather, Rubber, and PlasticswJournal:27776x2460-44617nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.20543/mkkp.v30i2.1313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02421naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100003500152245014500187500001400332520108200346592002801428650001501456650001601471650001601487650001301503650001901516650001901535650001101554650001701565650000701582650001201589653001701601653003101618653001101649653003001660700001801690700001301708700001701721700005301738773010001791856008701891852000901978655001201987IND60704576220221121235956.0201024e20210201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070457622DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2020.1276542doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShishir, Mohammad Rezaul Islam10aImproving the physicochemical stability and functionality of nanoliposome using green polymer for the delivery of pelargonidin-3-O-glucoside  aNAL-light  aThis study aimed to improve the physicochemical stability of nanoliposome (NL) with enhanced functionality for the delivery of Pelargonidin-3-O-glucoside (P3G) using biopolymers, i.e. chitosan (CH) and pectin (P). In this study, we successfully developed stabilized liposomal carriers, i.e. CH-conjugated NL (CH-NL) and P-conjugated CH-NL (P-CH-NL) using an optimum concentration of CH (0.6 wt%) and P (0.5 wt%). Results revealed that P-CH-NL had better physical stability to salt and pH with maximum P3G retention (>97%) under oxidative, thermal, and UV conditions. Nanoliposomes were more stable under refrigerated-storage and ensured high P3G retention (>96%). In vitro mucoadhesion study revealed that CH-NL had better mucin adsorption efficiency (59.72%) followed by P-CH-NL and NL. Furthermore, CH-NL and P-CH-NL alternatively had better stability to serum than NL. Taken together, the stabilization of nanoliposome using chitosan and pectin can be a promising approach for the delivery of hydrophilic compounds in association with enhanced stability and functionality.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3abiopolymers 3ablood serum 3achitosan 3afood chemistry 3ahydrophilicity 3amucins 3amucoadhesion 3apH 3apectins 0aNanoliposome 0aPelargonidin-3-O-glucoside 0aPectin 0aPhysicochemical stability1 aKarim, Naymul1 aXu, Yang1 aXie, Jiahong1 aChen, Wei1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2373-24370 tFood chemistry.g2021 Feb. 01, v. 337 p.127654-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8139x0308-81467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2020.1276543Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03144naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245010300159300001800262500002000280520172400300592002802024596005702052650002402109650002802133650002202161650000802183650001902191650001302210650001002223650001502233650002702248650001602275650001202291700001702303700002302320700001802343700002302361700002202384700005802406700002002464773011802484856007502602852000902677655001202686IND60789281520221116142452.0220819e202208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078928152DNAL7 a10.1111/febs.163892doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aUesugi, Gakuto10aRecognition of tRNAIle with a UAU anticodon by isoleucyl‐tRNA synthetase in lactic acid bacteria  ap. 4888-4900.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aIn almost all eubacteria, the AUA codon is translated by tRNAᴵˡᵉ² bearing lysidine at the wobble position. Lysidine is introduced by tRNAᴵˡᵉ lysidine synthetase (TilS) via post‐transcriptional modification of the cytidine of tRNAᴵˡᵉ²(CAU). Lactobacillus casei and Lactobacillus plantarum have tilS homologues and tRNAᴵˡᵉ²(CAU) genes. In addition, L. casei also has another tRNAᴵˡᵉ² gene with an UAU anticodon. L. plantarum has a tRNAᴵˡᵉ(UAU)‐like RNA. Here, we demonstrate that L. casei tRNAᴵˡᵉ²(UAU) is charged with isoleucine by L. casei isoleucyl‐tRNA synthetase (IleRS) but not by L. plantarum IleRS, even though the amino acid identity of these two enzymes is over 60%. It has been reported that, in Mycoplasma mobile, which has its tRNAᴵˡᵉ²(UAU) but no tilS homologue, an Arg residue at position 865 of the IleRS is required for recognition of the UAU anticodon. This position is occupied by an Arg also in the IleRSs from both of the Lactobacillus species. Thus, other residues in L. casei, IleRS should also contribute to the recognition of tRNAᴵˡᵉ²(UAU). We found that a chimeric L. casei IleRS in which the N‐terminal domain was replaced by the corresponding region of L. plantatarum IleRS has very low aminoacylation activity towards both tRNAᴵˡᵉ²(UAU) and tRNAᴵˡᵉ¹(GAU). The A18G mutant had barely detectable aminoacylation activity towards either of the tRNAsᴵˡᵉ. However, a double point mutant of A18G and G19N aminoacylated tRNAᴵˡᵉ¹(GAU), but not tRNAᴵˡᵉ²(UAU). Our results suggest that, for L. casei IleRS, Ala18 and Gly19 also play a critical role in recognition of tRNAᴵˡᵉ²(UAU).  aPublisher supplied data  a19K06491cJapan Society for the Promotion of Science 3aLactobacillus casei 3aLactobacillus plantarum 3aMycoplasma mobile 3aRNA 3aaminoacylation 3acytidine 3agenes 3aisoleucine 3aisoleucine-tRNA ligase 3alactic acid 3amutants1 aFukuba, Yuho1 aYamamoto, Takayuki1 aInaba, Nozomi1 aFurukawa, Haruyuki1 aYoshizawa, Satoko1 aTomikawa, Chie1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7908-85721 aTakai, Kazuyuki0 tFEBS journal.g2022 Aug., v. 289, no. 16 p.4888-4900dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3943524x1742-464X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/febs.163893Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02696naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100005800152245014000210500001900350520100900369592002801378650001701406650001701423650001101440650001501451650001901466650000901485650001901494650002101513650000701534650001501541650001801556650001101574650001501585653002601600653001601626653002501642653002301667653001901690653002101709653002001730700006401750700001801814700002401832700002801856700001901884700003201903700001901935773010401954856008702058852000902145655001202154IND60697074220221118052741.0201209e202009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069707422DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfb.2020.1111462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAllaw, Mohamad1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2063-663110aAdvanced strategy to exploit wine-making waste by manufacturing antioxidant and prebiotic fibre-enriched vesicles for intestinal health  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aGrape extract-loaded fibre-enriched vesicles, nutriosomes, were prepared by combining antioxidant extracts obtained from grape pomaces and a prebiotic, soluble fibre (Nutriose®FM06). The nutriosomes were small in size (from ∼140 to 260 nm), homogeneous (polydispersity index < 0.2) and highly negative (∼ −79 mV). The vesicles were highly stable during 12 months of storage at 25 °C. When diluted with warmed (37 °C) acidic medium (pH 1.2) of high ionic strength, the vesicles only displayed an increase of the mean diameter and a low release of the extract, which were dependent on Nutriose concentration. The formulations were highly biocompatible and able to protect intestinal cells (Caco-2) from oxidative stress damage. In vivo results underlined that the composition of mouse microbiota was not affected by the vesicular formulations. Overall results support the potential application of grape nutriosomes as an alternative strategy for the protection of the intestinal tract.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantioxidants 3agrape pomace 3agrapes 3aintestines 3aionic strength 3amice 3amicroorganisms 3aoxidative stress 3apH 3aprebiotics 3asoluble fiber 3awastes 3awinemaking 0aPhospholipid vesicles 0aNutriosomes 0aAntioxidant activity 0aPrebiotic activity 0aGut microbiota 0aIntestinal cells 0aIn vivo studies1 aManca, Maria Letizia1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3787-257X1 aCaddeo, Carla1 aRecio, Maria Carmen1 aPérez Brocal, Vicente,1 aMoya, Andrés,1 aFernàndez-Busquets, Xavier1 aManconi, Maria0 tColloids and surfaces.g2020 Sept., v. 193 p.111146-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11946x0927-77657nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfb.2020.1111463Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03679naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002000149245008200169300001400251520197300265592002802238650002102266650002602287650001102313650002702324650001502351650003002366650002502396650000902421650001402430650002202444650001102466650002902477650002002506650000902526650001202535650001702547650001102564650001402575650001502589650000902604650001402613650001502627650001302642650001502655651001902670651001602689653001902705653000902724653002502733653001702758653002602775700001902801700002202820773013002842856008402972852000903056655001203065IND60615940320221118085216.0190318e201812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061594032DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jembe.2018.09.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchaefer, Jacob10aPopulation genomics of Fundulus grandis exposed to oil from Deepwater Horizon  ap. 82-90.  aThe April 2010 Deepwater Horizon (DWH) oil spill released over 4 million barrels of oil into northern Gulf of Mexico ecosystems. Due to the magnitude of the spill and observed effects from previous spills, the ecological impacts were predicted to be catastrophic. While negative effects of petroleum hydrocarbon exposure to fish have been documented at the organismal scale, most studies of fish assemblages have noted few, if any, DWH impacts. Our understanding of DWH effects is therefore limited by a disconnect in results reported at different organizational levels. We used population genomic tools to test hypotheses about population-level DWH impacts to Gulf Killifish (Fundulus grandis) in coastal Mississippi. Fundulus grandis is one of the most abundant marsh species in the northern Gulf of Mexico, and along with the sister species F. heteroclitus, has served as a model for toxicology research. We collected genotyping by sequencing data from four populations of F. grandis (two oiled and two not) to test predictions about DWH-related gene flow, demographics, genetic diversity and evidence of selection. Mississippi populations of F. grandis showed clear genetic structure, but there were few indicators (e.g. reduced genetic diversity, lower Ne estimates) consistent with large-scale mortality or migration related to DWH oil. Only one estimate of effective population size was reduced in oil-exposed populations and of the twenty outlier loci only two were in regions with potential adaptive significance (i.e., immune functions). While the toxic effects of oil on F. grandis at the organismal level is well established, the minimal impacts we detected to populations along the Mississippi coast likely reflects the complexity of the northern Gulf of Mexico and DWH oil spill. However, we do recognize that the patchiness of oil exposure and low genome coverage of the data limit our ability to conclude there were no DWH effects on these populations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFundulus grandis 3aFundulus heteroclitus 3acoasts 3ademographic statistics 3aecosystems 3aeffective population size 3aenvironmental impact 3afish 3agene flow 3agenetic variation 3agenome 3agenotyping by sequencing 3aimmune response 3aloci 3amarshes 3ametagenomics 3amodels 3amortality 3aoil spills 3aoils 3apetroleum 3aprediction 3atoxicity 3atoxicology 3aGulf of Mexico 3aMississippi 0aGulf of Mexico 0aFish 0aPopulation structure 0aDemographics 0aOutlier loci analysis1 aKreiser, Brian1 aFlanagan, Stephen0 tJournal of experimental marine biology and ecology.g2018 Dec., v. 509 p.82-90dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11705x0022-09817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jembe.2018.09.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02946naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001400151245014100165520165400306592002801960650001701988650001902005650001202024650002102036650000902057650002002066650001102086650002502097650001502122651001002137653003002147653001702177653003502194653002202229653001102251653002302262700002202285700001702307773010502324856008602429852000902515655001202524IND60705458520221121233353.0210617e202010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070545852DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhydrol.2020.1253372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGao, Chao10aDevelopment and hydrometeorological evaluation of a new stochastic daily rainfall model: Coupling Markov chain with rainfall event model  aStochastic rainfall models have been widely used for hydrological modelling and climate change impact studies, the accuracy of which can substantially affect the reliability of water resources planning, hydraulic structure design and flood and drought risk assessment. The primary objective of this study is to develop a stochastic daily rainfall model through coupling a Markov chain model with a rainfall event model (SDRM-MCREM) to simultaneously preserve the statistical properties of rainfall time series and rainfall events. The newly developed model is applied to the Qu River basin, East China and its performance is evaluated at catchment scale. Results demonstrate that SDRM-MCREM shows a good performance in reproducing most of the rainfall time-series statistics (i.e. rainfall percentiles, average monthly and annual rainfall, inter-monthly rainfall variability and extreme rainfall) and rainfall event characteristics (i.e. distributions of wet and dry spells, occurrence frequency of different rainfall event classes, temporal rainfall patterns and their occurrence frequency in different rainfall event classes). The statistics of average runoff and extreme runoff are also well preserved by using the SDRM-MCREM simulations as input of hydrological modelling except that the interannual variability of rainfall and runoff is slightly underestimated. Moreover, SDRM-MCREM shows a great potential to be used for flood and drought risk assessment in reproducing the exceedance probabilities of high flows (e.g. annual maximum 1-day, 3-day and 5-day mean runoff) and low flows (e.g. annual minimum 7-day, 30-day and 90-day mean runoff).  aPublisher supplied data 3aMarkov chain 3aclimate change 3adrought 3ahydrometeorology 3arain 3arisk assessment 3arunoff 3atime series analysis 3awatersheds 3aChina 0aStochastic rainfall model 0aMarkov chain 0aRainfall event characteristics 0aRainfall patterns 0aCopula 0aHigh and low flows1 aBooij, Martijn J.1 aXu, Yue-Ping0 tJournal of hydrology.g2020 Oct., v. 589 p.125337-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl46539x0022-16947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2020.1253373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02702naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094024002200131024001900153040001800172100001700190245015000207300001800357506007600375520149900451592002801950506003701978650001002015650001202025650001602037650001702053650001902070650001602089700001802105700002002123773010302143856008502246852000902331655001202340IND60532676220221207074257.0160728e20160621xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053267622DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.biochem.5b013632doi7 aPMC49759482pmcid7 a272243092pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Yuxiu,10aCholesterol-Dependent Phase-Demixing in Lipid Bilayers as a Switch for the Activity of the Phosphoinositide-Binding Cytoskeletal Protein Gelsolin  ap. 3361-3369.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe lateral distribution of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP₂) in lipid bilayers is affected both by divalent cation-mediated attractions and cholesterol-dependent phase demixing. The effects of lateral redistribution of PIP₂ within a membrane on PIP₂–protein interactions are explored with an N-terminal fragment of gelsolin (NtGSN) that severs actin in a Ca²⁺-insensitive manner. The extent of NtGSN inhibition by PIP₂-containing large unilamellar vesicles (LUVs) depends on the lateral organization of the membrane as quantified by an actin-severing assay. At a fixed PIP₂ mole fraction, the inhibition is largely enhanced by the segregation of liquid ordered/liquid disordered (Lₒ/Ld) phases that is induced by altering either cholesterol content or temperature, whereas the presence of Ca²⁺ only slightly improves the inhibition. Inhibition of gelsolin induced by demixed LUVs is more effective with decreasing temperature, coincident with increasing membrane order as determined by Laurdan generalized polarization and is reversible as the temperature increases. This result suggests that PIP₂-mediated inhibition of gelsolin function depends not only on changes in global concentration but also on lateral distribution of PIP₂. These observations imply that gelsolin, and perhaps other PIP₂-regulated proteins, can be activated or inactivated by the formation of nanodomains or clusters without changing PIP₂ bulk concentration in the cell membrane.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aactin 3acalcium 3acholesterol 3acytoskeleton 3alipid bilayers 3atemperature1 aBucki, Robert1 aJanmey, Paul A.0 tBiochemistry.g2016 June 21, v. 55, no. 24 p.3361-3369dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-49957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.biochem.5b013633Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03083naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245015800165300001800323500001400341520185600355592002802211596006402239650001902303650001402322650001102336650001602347650002502363650001102388650001002399650002802409650001202437651001002449700001402459773014502473856008202618852000902700655001202709IND60708403020221119202235.0200825e202010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070840302DNAL7 a10.1007/s10668-019-00498-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPeng, Zhimin10aEvaluation of the relationship between energy consumption, economic growth, and CO2 emissions in China’ transport sector: the FMOLS and VECM approaches  ap. 6537-6561.  aNAL-light  aTransport sustainability is an important foundation for achieving sustainable development in an economy. Particularly, environmental policies cannot overlook the growing importance in the transport sector as the economy expands. In this context, it is necessary to investigate the relationship between transport energy consumption (TEN), transport economic growth (TGDP), and transport CO₂ emissions (TCE) to formulate the reasonable and specific transport policies. This paper investigated the long-run elasticity and causality between TEN, TGDP, and TCE for the case of China using the panel data covering 30 provincial regions during the period 2004–2016. Firstly, the stationary of each variable series was examined using the panel unit root test. Secondly, the cointegrating relationship in bivariate models was investigated by employing the panel Pedroni cointegration test. Thirdly, based on the fully modified ordinary least squares (FMOLS), the long-run elasticity coefficients in bivariate models were estimated. Finally, the panel Granger causality test based on the vector error correction model was utilized to determine whether the causality existed between the variables. The empirical results indicated that: (1) each variable was found to be integrated of order one, and the cointegrating relationship existed in all bivariate modes. (2) The panel FMOLS tests revealed that the long-run elasticity of TCE to TEN was almost equal to the long-run elasticity of TEN to TCE; the long-run elasticity of TCE to TGDP was significantly higher than the long-run elasticity of TGDP to TCE; and the long-run elasticity of TEN to TGDP was significantly higher than the long-run elasticity of TGDP to TEN. (3) Importantly, the bidirectional causal relationships existed between the TEN, TGDP, and TCE both in the short-run and in the long-run.  aPublisher supplied data  a17BJY139cNational Natural Science Foundation of China (CN) 3acarbon dioxide 3aemissions 3aenergy 3aenvironment 3aenvironmental policy 3amodels 3apaper 3asustainable development 3atesting 3aChina1 aWu, Qunqi0 tEnvironment, development and sustainability.g2020 Oct., v. 22, no. 7 p.6537-6561dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl3870050x1387-585X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10668-019-00498-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02597naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001900144245010400163300001600267520134600283592002801629650001601657650002101673650002101694650001501715650001601730650001001746651001101756653001001767653000801777653002101785653001101806653002201817653001701839653002501856700001901881700001901900700001601919700002401935773011701959856007802076852000902154655001202163IND60515878720221121040743.0160321e20140303xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051587872DNAL7 a10.1139/cjfr-2013-05352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAstrup, Rasmus10aApproaches for estimating stand-level volume using terrestrial laser scanning in a single-scan mode  ap. 666-676.  aThe most efficient way to obtain stand inventory data with terrestrial laser systems (TLS) is with the single-scan mode, which involves taking one scan at a single point. With a single-scan setup, there will be a nondetection of trees in a plot and the representation of the individual trees will be incomplete. We explore how stand-level volume estimates, based on the single-scan mode, perform compared with standard inventory estimates. We base our study on 166 plots in 12 mature stands dominated by Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) and Norway spruce (Picea abies L. Karst) in southern Norway. First, we compare individual-tree volume estimates from TLS with estimates from volume functions and measurements from harvesters. We show that individual-tree volumes can be estimated with high precision and accuracy with TLS in single-scan mode. Secondly, we test three approaches for correction of nondetection relying on model-based estimates of the detection probability obtained by point transect sampling estimators. We show that all three approaches adjust for nondetection and yield stand-level volume estimates that are similar to those obtained by fixed-area sampling. In conclusion, our results indicate that stand-level volume estimates, based on single-scan mode TLS data, perform well compared with standard inventory estimates.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPicea abies 3aPinus sylvestris 3aforest inventory 3aharvesters 3aprobability 3atrees 3aNorway 0aLidar 0aTLS 0aforest inventory 0avolume 0adistance sampling 0anondetection 0aangle count sampling1 aDucey, Mark J.1 aGranhus, Aksel1 aRitter, Tim1 avon Lüpke, Nikolas0 tCanadian journal of forest research =.g2014 Mar. 3, v. 44, no. 6 p.666-676dNRC Research Pressx1208-60377nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjfr-2013-05353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03488naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002200152245005700174300001800231520230400249592002802553650001502581650001902596650002302615650001002638650002202648650001502670650002302685650001202708650001402720650002202734651001602756700001902772700002002791700002302811700001802834700002202852700001902874773010902893856005503002852000903057655001203066IND4476619920221120171614.0120620e201207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447661992DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2699.2011.02680.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSiler, Cameron D.10aDid geckos ride the Palawan raft to the Philippines?  ap. 1217-1234.  aAim We examine the genetic diversity within the lizard genus Gekko in the Philippine islands to understand the role of geography and geological history in shaping species diversity in this group. We test multiple biogeographical hypotheses of species relationships, including the recently proposed Palawan Ark Hypothesis. Location Southeast Asia and the Philippines. Methods Samples of all island endemic and widespread Philippine Gekko species were collected and sequenced for one mitochondrial gene (NADH dehydrogenase subunit 2) and one nuclear gene (phosducin). We used maximum likelihood and Bayesian phylogenetic methods to derive the phylogeny. Divergence time analyses were used to estimate the time tree of Philippine Gekko in order to test biogeographical predictions of species relationships. The phylogenetic trees from the posterior distribution of the Bayesian analyses were used for testing biogeographical hypotheses. Haplotype networks were created for the widespread species Gekko mindorensis to explore genetic variation within recently divergent clades. Results Both maximum likelihood and Bayesian phylogenetic analyses indicated that Philippine Gekko species are a diverse clade with a long history in the archipelago. Ancestral range reconstruction and divergence time analyses suggest a Palawan microcontinental origin for this clade, coinciding with Palawan’s separation from Asia beginning 30 Ma, with subsequent diversification in the oceanic Philippine islands. The widespread species G. mindorensis and G. monarchus diversified in the late Miocene/early Pliocene and are potentially complexes of numerous undescribed species. Main conclusions The view of the Philippine islands as a ‘fringing archipelago’ does not explain the pattern of species diversity in the genus Gekko. Philippine Gekko species have diversified within the archipelago over millions of years of isolation, forming a large diverse group of endemic species. Furthermore, the Philippine radiation of gekkonid lizards demonstrates biogeographical patterns most consistent with stochastic colonization followed by in situ diversification. Our results reveal the need to consider deeper time geological processes and their potential role in the evolution of some Philippine terrestrial organisms.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGekkonidae 3aNAD (coenzyme) 3aNADH dehydrogenase 3agenes 3agenetic variation 3ahaplotypes 3aindigenous species 3alizards 3aphylogeny 3aspecies diversity 3aPhilippines1 aOaks, Jamie R.1 aWelton, Luke J.1 aLinkem, Charles W.1 aSwab, John C.1 aDiesmos, Arvin C.1 aBrown, Rafe M.0 tJournal of biogeography.g2012 July, v. 39, no. 7 p.1217-1234dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0305-02707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2699.2011.02680.x  aDNAL 7aarticle02223naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100005800147245011200205300001800317520096700335592002801302650001401330650001701344650001901361650001101380650001901391650001701410653000901427653002701436653002001463653002101483653002401504653001201528700001801540700002701558700002201585700002001607773009601627856008101723852000901804655001201813IND60724919020221119063629.0210124e201806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072491902DNAL7 a10.1016/j.dib.2018.04.1042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMehrzad, Jalil1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8174-543110aData on environmentally relevant level of aflatoxin B1-induced human dendritic cells' functional alteration  ap. 1576-1580.  aWe assessed the effects of naturally occurring levels of AFB₁ on the expression of key immune molecules and function of human monocyte-derived dendritic cells (MDDCs) by cell culture, RT-qPCR, and flow cytometry. Data here revealed that an environmentally relevant level of AFB₁ led to remarkably weakened key functional capacity of DCs, up-regulation of key transcripts and DCs apoptosis, down-regulation of key phagocytic element, CD64, and creation of pseudolicensing direction of DCs. Flow cytometry data confirmed a damage towards DCs, i.e., increased apoptosis. The detailed data and their mechanistic effects and the outcome are available in this research article (Mehrzad et al., 2018) [1]. The impaired phagocytosis capacity with triggered pseudolicensing direction of MDDCs caused by AFB₁ and dysregulation of the key functional genes could provide a mechanistic explanation for the observed in vivo immunotoxicity associated with this mycotoxin.  aPublisher supplied data 3aapoptosis 3acell culture 3aflow cytometry 3ahumans 3aimmunotoxicity 3aphagocytosis 0aAFB1 0aAFB1-detoxifying genes 0aDendritic cells 0aFunctional genes 0aImmunnoderegulation 0aRT-qPCR1 aBahari, Abbas1 aBassami, Mohammad Reza1 aMahmoudi, Mahmoud1 aDehghani, Hesam0 tData in Brief.g2018 June, v. 18 p.1576-1580dElsevier Inc.wJournal:23203x2352-34097nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.dib.2018.04.1043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02314naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245010800159300002000267520125500287592002801542650002201570650001201592650001401604650001601618650002201634700002101656700002001677700001501697700001501712700002201727773014401749856007401893852000901967655001201976IND60641838320221119074506.0190506e20161011xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064183832DNAL7 a10.1039/c6ta05055g2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSafdari, Majid10aLayered 2D alkyldiammonium lead iodide perovskites: synthesis, characterization, and use in solar cells  ap. 15638-15646.  aThe synthetic route and properties of three 2D hybrid organic/inorganic lead iodide perovskite materials are reported. The 2D perovskites were synthesized from the reaction between PbI₂ and the di-cations of 1,4-diaminobutane, 1,6-diaminohexane, and 1,8-diaminooctane. The resulting products were [NH₃(CH₂)₄NH₃]PbI₄ (BdAPbI₄), [NH₃(CH₂)₆NH₃]PbI₄ (HdAPbI₄), and [NH₃(CH₂)₈NH₃]PbI₄ (OdAPbI₄). Structural characterization shows that two dimensional perovskite structures were formed with inorganic structural planes separated by organic layers. Absorption spectra show band gaps of 2.37 eV (BdAPbI₄), 2.44 eV (HdAPbI₄), and 2.55 eV (OdAPbI₄). The 2D perovskite materials were investigated as light absorbing materials in solid state solar cells. The best performing material under moist, ambient conditions was BdAPbI₄ (1.08% efficiency), which was comparable to methylammonium Pb(ii) iodide (MAPbI₃) solar cells (2.1% efficiency) manufactured and studied under analogous conditions. When compared to MAPbI₃, the 2D materials have larger band gaps and lower photoconductivity, while BdAPbI₄ based solar cells shows a comparable absorbed photon-to-current efficiency as compared to MAPbI₃ based ones.  aPublisher supplied data 3a1,6-hexanediamine 3aammonia 3achemistry 3asolar cells 3aspectral analysis1 aSvensson, Per H.1 aHoang, Minh Tam1 aOh, Ilwhan1 aKloo, Lars1 aGardner, James M.0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2016 Oct. 11, v. 4, no. 40 p.15638-15646dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c6ta05055g3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02651naa a2200685 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100002700166245008200193300001800275500001500293520061100308592002800919650001300947650001500960650001700975650000800992650001501000650001301015650001701028650001501045650002701060650001201087650002701099650002901126650001001155650002201165650001101187650001301198650001101211650002801222650002801250650000901278650002701287650002101314650003501335650008101370650003901451650005901490651001001549651002501559653001601584700002501600700002001625700002501645700002301670700002101693700001901714700002201733700001901755700002301774773009901797856004801896852000901944655001201953IND50070240720221117202401.0131029e201311  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007024072DNAL7 a236858972pmid7 a10.1007/s00705-013-1717-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMishra, Baijayantimala10aGenotyping and subtyping of mumps virus isolates from the Indian subcontinent  ap. 2359-2363.  a2019-12-06  aMumps is a vaccine-preventable disease that usually occurs as a self-limiting parotitis, but it can also lead to several life-threatening complications, including pancreatitis, meningitis, and encephalitis.

A key question is whether evolution has led to optimal protein expression that maximizes immediate growth rate (short‐term fitness) in a robust manner (consistently across diverse conditions). Alternatively, they could display suboptimal short‐term fitness, because they cannot do better or because they instead strive for long‐term fitness maximization by, for instance, preparing for future conditions. To address this question, we focus on the ATP‐producing enzyme F₁F₀ H⁺‐ATPase, which is an abundant enzyme and ubiquitously expressed across conditions. Its expression is highly regulated and dependent on growth rate and nutrient conditions. For instance, during growth on sugars, when metabolism is overflowing acetate, glycolysis supplies most ATP, while H⁺‐ATPase is the main source of ATP synthesis during growth on acetate. We tested the optimality of H⁺‐ATPase expression in Escherichia coli across different nutrient conditions. In all tested conditions, wild‐type E. coli expresses its H⁺‐ATPase remarkably close (within a few per cent) to optimal concentrations that maximize immediate growth rate. This work indicates that bacteria can indeed achieve robust optimal protein expression for immediate growth‐rate maximization.  aPublisher supplied data  aVIDI/864.11.011cNWO 3aEscherichia coli 3aH-transporting ATP synthase 3aacetates 3aevolution 3aglycolysis 3aprotein synthesis1 aBruggeman, Frank J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0255-47660 tFEBS journal.g2022 Aug., v. 289, no. 16 p.4925-4934dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3943524x1742-464X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/febs.164013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04390naa a2200721 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002600147245012200173300001300295520243200308592002802740650001102768650001502779650001002794650001402804650002002818650002702838650001502865650001302880650002102893650002502914650004302939650002802982650001403010650002603024650001603050650002203066653000803088653001003096653000903106653000803115653000803123653001003131653000903141653000903150653000603159653000803165653000903173653000803182653000703190653000803197653001103205653000903216653000703225653000803232653002403240653001803264653002903282653001703311653002903328653002503357700002903382700002103411700002403432773010903456856008203565852000903647655001203656IND60611882220221117215609.0190411e201703  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061188222DNAL7 a10.1016/j.eja.2016.12.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPadilla, Francisco M.10aDetermination of sufficiency values of canopy reflectance vegetation indices for maximum growth and yield of cucumber  ap. 1-15.  aLarge nitrogen (N) fertilizer applications are a feature of intensive vegetable production systems, and optimal N management is required to maximize N use efficiency and minimize N losses. Vegetation indices (VIs) of canopy reflectance, measured with proximal sensors, are generally strongly related to crop N status. For practical application, sufficiency values that distinguish between N deficiency and sufficiency are required. In this work, sufficiency values of VIs for maximum crop growth and for yield were determined for two cucumber crops grown in contrasting seasons (Autumn and Spring). Canopy reflectance was measured with a Crop Circle ACS-470 sensor. Sufficiency values for maximum growth were based on the relationships of VIs with the Nitrogen Nutrition Index (NNI), i.e. the ratio between actual and critical crop N contents. Sufficiency values for maximum yield were based on linear-plateau relationships of yield with VIs. Strong relationships were obtained between all VIs and both NNI and yield for most of the weekly measurements during both crops. For NNI, best-fit relationships were linear, quadratic, power or exponential, and had coefficients of determination (R2) of 0.61–0.98. For yield, most linear-plateau relationships between yield and VIs had R2 values of 0.47–0.89. VIs based on reflectance in green and red edge had slightly better relationships with NNI and yield than VIs in the red, with the Green Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (GNDVI) and the Green Ratio Vegetation Index (GRVI) being the most sensitive and consistent indices for estimating both crop NNI and yield. Relationships between VIs and NNI and yield for all weekly measurements of each crop, and for the two crops combined, were also analyzed to provide unique sufficiency values for maximum growth and yield that applied to the entire crop cycle of each crop and of both crops considered together. Overall, there were slight differences between sufficiency values for maximum growth and for maximum yield and the unique sufficiency values were generally intermediate to the weekly sufficiency values. This study demonstrated the potential for using VIs for monitoring crop N nutrition and yield in cucumber. The calculated sufficiency values of VIs may facilitate the use of proximal optical sensors in farming practice for optimal N management through periodic monitoring for deviation from sufficiency values.  aPublisher supplied data 3acanopy 3acrop yield 3acrops 3acucumbers 3afarming systems 3afertilizer application 3amonitoring 3anitrogen 3anitrogen content 3anitrogen fertilizers 3anormalized difference vegetation index 3anutrient use efficiency 3anutrition 3aproduction technology 3areflectance 3avegetable growing 0aAIC 0aANOVA 0aCCCI 0aCNC 0aDAT 0aGNDVI 0aGRVI 0aMTCI 0aN 0aNIR 0aNDVI 0aNNI 0aR2 0aREI 0aRENDVI 0aRRVI 0aVI 0aVIi 0aCrop Circle ACS-470 0aFertilization 0aNitrogen nutrition index 0aN Management 0aProximal optical sensors 0aVegetable production1 aPeña-Fleitas, M.

There is a need for optimization of the growth of the microalgae and its content of essential fatty acids. Here, the fatty acid profile of Rhodomonas in relation to cell density during cultivation in a tubular PBR is investigated. It is expected that cell density is an important factor in controlling productivity and fatty acid content of the microalgae because cell density is important in determining light availability due to the self‐shading of the algae. The carbon productivity as a function of cell density is described by a saturation curve. The carbon productivity and the productivity of total fatty acids are lowest at the lowest cell density, and independent of cell density at higher cell densities. The relative contribution of the two poly‐unsaturated fatty acids eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) increases with increasing cell density and saturates at 1 × 10⁶ cells/ml. We conclude that large‐scale production of Rhodomonas in this tubular PBR should take place at cell densities of 1 × 10⁶ cells/ml, while there are indications for increasing difficulties in maintaining steady‐state production in this PBR at higher cell densities.  aPublisher supplied data  a67‐2013‐1cInnovationsfonden 3aRhodomonas 3aaquaculture 3abiomass 3acarbon 3adocosahexaenoic acid 3aeicosapentaenoic acid 3aessential fatty acids 3afatty acid composition 3amicroalgae 3aphotobioreactors1 aPedersen, Jakob Skov1 aJørgensen, Lars1 aKuehn, Anker1 aHansen, Benni Winding1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1145-561X1 aNielsen, Søren Laurentius1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4309-51530 tAquaculture research.g2020 Aug., v. 51, no. 8 p.3367-3375dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl53865x1355-557X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/are.146723Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01966naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245008400172300001600256500001500272520062600287592002800913650001800941650003000959650004400989650001501033650001301048650001101061650001201072650002001084650001301104650001001117653002601127653001601153653001401169653001301183700002301196700002301219700002501242700001901267773014001286856008501426852000901511655001201520IND60527870620221119021101.0190415e201606  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052787062DNAL7 a10.1016/j.phytol.2016.04.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOkoye, Festus B.C10aOlamannosides D and E: Further kaempferol triglycosides from Olax mannii leaves  ap. 152-155.  a2019-12-06  aFurther chemical investigation of the butanol fraction of Olax mannii Oliv.

During this time, there has been substantial progress in the development of sensitive methods to detect rotaviruses in foals, enabling surveillance of the genotypes present in various horse populations. However, there has been limited epidemiological investigation into the significance of these circulating genotypes, their correlation with disease and the use of vaccination in these animal populations. Our knowledge of the pathogenesis of rotavirus infection in foals is based on a limited number of studies on a small number of foals and, therefore, most of our understanding in this area has been extrapolated from studies in other species. Questions such as the concentrations of rotavirus particles shed in the faeces of infected foals, both with and without diarrhoea, and factors determining the presence or absence of clinical disease remain to be investigated, as does the relative and absolute efficacy of currently available vaccines. The answer to these questions may help direct research into the development of more effective control measures.  aPublisher supplied data 3acontrol methods 3adiarrhea 3aepidemiological studies 3afeces 3afoals 3agenotype 3amonitoring 3aresearch and development 3avaccination 3avaccines 2aAnimals 2aHorse Diseasesxdiagnosisxepidemiologyxpathologyxvirology. 2aHorses 2aRotavirusxclassificationximmunologyxphysiology. 2aRotavirus Infectionsxdiagnosisxepidemiologyxpathologyxveterinaryxvirology. 0aG 0aP 0aEM 0aELISA 0aPCR 0aRT-PCR 0aRT-LAMP 0aTLPs 0aDLPs 0aSLPs 0aBLS 0aEquine rotavirus 0aFoal 0aDiarrhoea 0aVirus 0aReview1 aGilkerson, James R.1 aBrowning, Glenn F.0 tVeterinary microbiology.g2013 Nov. 29, v. 167, no. 1-2 p.135-144dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl8205x0378-11357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2013.07.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02393naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100005500139245011900194300001800313500002000331520090000351592002801251596006601279596005401345596010901399650002001508650000801528650001501536650001601551650001201567650002201579650001101601650002201612700001601634700001601650700001601666700001201682700001601694700001501710700001801725773012201743856007301865852000901938655001201947IND60701652720221121064416.0200712e202008  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070165272DNAL7 a10.1111/are.146622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJiang, Song1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7258-762X10aAnaesthetic effect of eugenol at different concentrations and temperatures on black tiger shrimp (Penaeus monodon)  ap. 3268-3273.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe anaesthetic effects of eugenol on Penaeus monodon were investigated at the different eugenol concentrations (60, 110, 160 and 210 mg/L), water temperature (21, 26 and 31°C), air exposure time (3, 6, 9 and 12 min) and body weight (2.62 ± 0.27, 6.34 ± 0.36 and 11.43 ± 0.33 g). The anaesthesia and recovery time were recorded. The results showed that the anaesthesia time of the shrimp decreased with the increase in the eugenol concentration and water temperature, and the recovery time increased with the increase of the eugenol concentration and the decrease of water temperature. Under the same eugenol concentrations, the recovery time increased with the increase of air exposure time and body weight. Under the eugenol concentration range of 60–210 mg/L, the recovered rate was 100%. The results indicated that eugenol is a safe and efficient anaesthetic for P. monodon.  aPublisher supplied data  aCARS‐48cIndustrial Technology System of Modern Agriculture  a2018YFD0901302cNational Key R&D Program of China  a2019KJ149cGuangdong Provincial Special Fund for Modern Agriculture Industry Technology Innovation Teams 3aPenaeus monodon 3aair 3aanesthesia 3abody weight 3aeugenol 3aexposure duration 3ashrimp 3awater temperature1 aZhou, Falin1 aYang, Wanli1 aWu, Zhigang1 aLe, Yin1 aYang, Qibin1 aYu, Yebing1 aJiang, Shigui0 tAquaculture research.g2020 Aug., v. 51, no. 8 p.3268-3273dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl53865x1355-557X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/are.146623Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02933naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100005700152245010600209500001900315520166700334592002802001650000802029650001502037650002502052650003002077650001602107650001102123650002302134650001302157650001302170650001502183650001502198653001802213653002502231653002202256700005802278773010302336856008702439852000902526655001202535IND60697075120221118052627.0210114e202010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069707512DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfb.2020.1111552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aExner, Kai S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2934-607510aIdentifying a gold nanoparticle as a proactive carrier for transport of a doxorubicin-peptide complex  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aEfficient drug delivery to malignant cells in the human organism requires the application of drug-delivery systems (DDS) that consist of several building blocks, such as a biomolecule to bind the drug as well as a carrier for transport. In the present study, we investigate a potential DDS component for the cytostatic doxorubicin (DOX) that consists of a gold nanoparticle (Au-NP) and a short drug-binding peptide sequence. Combining molecular dynamics simulations with density functional theory calculations allows resolving the adsorption configurations of DOX at simulated physiological conditions as well as the interaction energies between the building blocks of the DDS. Interestingly, it turns out that the task of the Au-NP is not limited to being a passive carrier. The nanoparticle is directly involved in the stabilization of the drug by intercalating DOX together with a tryptophan residue from the peptide. Another favored adsorption configuration corresponds to an intercalation complex of DOX with two tryptophan residues, reminiscent of the intercalation of DOX between DNA bases. The insights gained in the present study allow deriving general conclusions about the surface chemistry of DOX: its tendency to intercalate seems not to depend on its π-stacking partners (organic or inorganic), as long as they can be properly arranged around the drug. Hence, DOX may be stabilized sufficiently during its delivery if intercalation within the carrier moieties is possible. This finding may assist the construction of a more complex DDS for DOX in the future, for which the investigated drug-peptide-nanoparticle conjugate may serve as a prototype.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aadsorption 3aamino acid sequences 3adensity functional theory 3adoxorubicin 3ahumans 3amolecular dynamics 3ananogold 3apeptides 3aprototypes 3atryptophan 0aDrug delivery 0aDrug-Binding peptide 0aGold nanoparticle1 aIvanova, Anela1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6220-79610 tColloids and surfaces.g2020 Oct., v. 194 p.111155-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11946x0927-77657nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfb.2020.1111553Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03193naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100005300151245012000204500001900324520182300343592002802166650001502194650001502209650001302224650002102237650001102258650001902269650001002288653004502298653003902343653002202382653002402404653002202428700001902450700001702469700001502486700001302501700005702514773010502571856008602676852000902762655001202771IND60705459220221121220957.0210223e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070545922DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhydrol.2020.1253452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Lei1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3395-101610aUnsteady flow to a partially penetrating pumping well with wellbore storage in a dual-permeability confined aquifer  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aIn this article, a new model is presented for imparting unsteady flow to a partially penetrating pumping well with wellbore storage placed in double-permeability confined aquifers to investigate the wellbore drawdown transient behavior. In this model, both the fracture and matrix systems are connected directly with the wellbore as flow pathways, while comprehensively considering the crossflow between the matrix and the fractures. The top and bottom boundaries are assumed to be impermeable, and the outer side boundaries could be infinite. Subsequently, Laplace transformation and finite Fourier cosine transformation are employed to obtain analytical solutions of the dual-permeability flow model in the Laplace domain. The derived analytical solution is general and can be reduced to several other previous results. The numerical inversion algorithm of Stehfest is used to solve the wellbore drawdown in the real time domain. Subsequently, the model is validated by comparing it with previous results. Groundwater flow characteristics are analyzed in detail and divided into five flow stages: wellbore storage flow, early-radial flow, quasi-spherical flow, crossflow between the matrix and the fractures, and quasi-radial flow. The different flow stages show some special values on the drawdown and its derivative log-log plots. There is a hump/dip feature in the semi-logarithmic curve of the drawdown derivative, which are inherent characteristic for dual-permeability flow behavior. The effects of some important parameters of the aquifer or pumping wells on drawdown and its derivative, such as wellbore storage coefficient, penetration ratio, crossflow coefficient, storativity ratio, transmissivity ratio, dimensionless aquifer thickness of anisotropy and skin factor, are analyzed and discussed in detail.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3aanisotropy 3adrawdown 3agroundwater flow 3amodels 3atransient flow 3awells 0aThree-dimensional dual-permeability flow 0aPartially penetrating pumping well 0aConfined aquifers 0aAnalytical solution 0aWellbore drawdown1 aXiang, Yangyue1 aHu, Jianling1 aLi, Taotao1 aCai, Chi1 aCai, Jianchao1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2950-888X0 tJournal of hydrology.g2020 Dec., v. 591 p.125345-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl46539x0022-16947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2020.1253453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01388naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245007400163300001600237520047100253592002800724650002000752650001200772650001800784651001200802700001700814700001900831700001800850700002200868773009400890856008100984852000901065655001201074IND60724919820221119063601.0210124e201808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072491982DNAL7 a10.1016/j.dib.2018.04.1132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJones, Jeff10aData on the risk perceptions of beach water safety in coastal Georgia  ap. 312-316.  aThese data reflect the perceptions of beach water quality drawn from a convenience sample of 238 visitors to Georgia (USA) beaches collected in June–July 2017 and are related to the research article entitled “Water quality and the perception of risk: a study of Georgia, USA, beachgoers” (Jones et al., 2018) [1].

Exposure to both BDE47 and BDE209 inhibited the growth of tobacco plants. The number of down-regulated DEGs following exposure to BDE47 was significantly higher than that following exposure to BDE209. Enrichment analysis using the KEGG showed that BDE47 and BDE209 primarily affected tobacco leaf photosynthesis-antenna proteins, photosynthesis, plant hormone signal transduction and α-linolenic acid metabolism. BDE47 primarily inhibits the synthesis of Chl a, and BDE209 has a more significant impact on Chl b. Most photosynthesis-related DEGs were concentrated in PSII and PSI; the number of down-regulated DEGs in PSI was significantly higher than that in PSII, and the range in which the PSI activity was reduced was also higher than that of PSII, i.e., PSII and PSI (particularly PSI) were sensitive to the effects of exposure to BDE47 and BDE209 on photosynthesis. The increase of the ratio of regulatory energy dissipation played an important protective role in alleviating the photoinhibition of PSII. Exposure to BDE47 and BDE209 can lead to the accumulation of ROS in tobacco leaves, but correspondingly, the activities of antioxidant enzymes SOD, POD, CAT, APX and GPX and the up-regulated expression of their coding genes play an important role in preventing excessive oxidative damage. Exposure to BDE47 and BDE209 promoted the up-regulation of gene expression related to Pro synthesis. In particular, the Pro synthetic process of the Orn pathway was promoted. Exposure to BDE47 and BDE209 induced the up-regulated expression of genes related to the synthesis of ABA and JA, promoted the synthesis of ABA and JA, and activated ABA and JA signal transduction pathways. In conclusion, both BDE47 and BDE209 inhibit the synthesis of chlorophyll and hinder the process of light energy capture and electron transfer in tobacco leaves. BDE47 was more toxic than BDE209. However, tobacco leaves can also adapt to BDE47 and BDE209 by regulating the antioxidant system, accumulating Pro and initiating the hormone signal transduction process. The results of this study provide a theoretical basis for the phytotoxicity mechanism of PBDEs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNicotiana tabacum 3aantioxidants 3abiphenyl 3achlorophyll 3adecabromodiphenyl ether 3aelectron transfer 3aenergy 3agene expression 3aleaves 3aphotoinhibition 3aphotosystem II 3aphytotoxicity 3aplant growth 3aprotective effect 3asignal transduction 3atobacco 3atranscriptomics 0aPBDEs 0aDEGs 0aBDE47 0aBDE209 0aKEGG 0aChl 0aChl a 0aChl b 0aPSII 0aPSI 0aROS 0aSOD 0aPOD 0aCAT 0aAPX 0aGPX 0aPro 0aOrn 0aABA 0aJA 0aPolybrominated diphenyl ethers 0aTobacco 0aTranscriptome 0aPhotosynthesis 0aHormone signaling 0aAntioxidant enzymes1 aYu, Yongtao1 aZhang, Hongbo1 aHuo, Yuze1 aLiu, Xiaoqian1 aChe, Yanhui1 aWang, Jiechen1 aSun, Guangyu1 aZhang, Huihui0 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2022 Mar. 15, v. 426 p.128012-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6200x0304-38947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2021.1280123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02320naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006300148245006200211300001800273500001400291520120500305592002801510596002801538650000901566650002501575650001601600650001501616650001401631650002001645650001201665650001601677651001101693700001801704773014501722856008201867852000901949655001201958IND60708404120221119204103.0200825e202010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070840412DNAL7 a10.1007/s10668-019-00503-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKaplan Mintz, Keren1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4565-291312aA cross-cultural perspective on facilitators of recycling  ap. 6627-6643.  aNAL-light  aThis study investigates the overall effect of individual-level variables on predicting recycling in a cross-cultural context. The objective of the study was to investigate the role of social norms and perceived behavioral control as moderators and/or mediators of the relations between culture and reported recycling behavior. A survey was conducted among 172 Jewish and Muslim-Bedouin residents of a rural regional council in Israel. The survey included scales measuring social norms, perceived behavioral control, and reported recycling. Results revealed strong cross-cultural differences in reported recycling behaviors, with higher reported recycling among Jewish than among Muslim-Bedouin residents. Perceived behavioral control made an almost identical contribution to the explained variability of recycling among both Jewish and Muslim-Bedouin residents. Social norms were a significantly stronger predictor in explaining recycling among Muslim-Bedouin than among Jewish residents, yet, no significant interaction effect was found between culture and social norms in explaining recycling. Both social norms and perceived behavioral control mediated the relations between culture and recycling.  aPublisher supplied data  a20005cIsrael Institute 3aJews 3acultural differences 3aenvironment 3aprediction 3arecycling 3asocial behavior 3asurveys 3avariability 3aIsrael1 aKurman, Jenny0 tEnvironment, development and sustainability.g2020 Oct., v. 22, no. 7 p.6627-6643dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl3870050x1387-585X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10668-019-00503-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03511naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001400150245015300164500001900317520168000336592002802016650002202044650002002066650001702086650001102103650002502114650001502139650001102154650001802165650002802183650002602211650001202237650000902249650001502258650001302273650002102286650002102307650002202328650002202350650001702372650001602389650002402405650001202429650001502441650002802456650001502484650003702499651001002536653003302546653003402579653002202613653002202635700001302657700001402670700002002684773008702704856008502791852000902876655001202885IND60704577120221121214649.0201025e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070457712DNAL7 a10.1016/j.catena.2020.1047912doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBi, Yinli10aRevegetation type drives rhizosphere arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi and soil organic carbon fractions in the mining subsidence area of northwest China  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe rhizosphere arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal (AMF) community and soil organic carbon (SOC) fractions are important in vegetation restoration because they can promote plant growth and environmental improvement in the mining subsidence area of northwest China. However, the effects of revegetation type on SOC fractions and the AMF community remain poorly understood despite their importance in promoting sustainable environmental development. Here, we have examined the rhizosphere soil AMF community and SOC fractions of five revegetation types comprising Amorpha fruticosa (AF), Hippophae rhamnoides (HR), Xanthoceras sorbifolium (XS), Cerasus humilis (CH), and Cerasus szechuanica (CS). Revegetation type significantly affected AMF α-diversity, communities and SOC fractions. The contents of soil microbial biomass carbon, dissolved organic carbon, readily oxidized organic carbon and readily extractable glomalin were maximum in HR. We found six genera of AMF (Glomus, Scutellospora, Paraglomus, Claroideoglomus, Ambispora and Diversispora) and Glomus was the most frequently occurring genus in each revegetation type. Nitrogen-fixing plants (AF and HR) may release large amounts of soil nutrients to promote the activity of the soil AMF community. Soil pH, SOC and C:N ratio play key roles in shifting the AMF community. Interactions between the soil AMF community and revegetation types are key to optimizing the restoration of degraded systems and accumulating soil organic matter. Our observations may provide fundamental guidelines in the assessment of ecosystem services and sustainable development in vegetation reconstruction in the coal mining subsidence areas.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAmorpha fruticosa 3aClaroideoglomus 3aDiversispora 3aGlomus 3aHippophae rhamnoides 3aParaglomus 3aPrunus 3aScutellospora 3aXanthoceras sorbifolium 3acarbon nitrogen ratio 3acatenas 3acoal 3aecosystems 3aglomalin 3aland restoration 3amicrobial carbon 3amycorrhizal fungi 3anitrogen fixation 3aplant growth 3arhizosphere 3asoil organic carbon 3asoil pH 3asubsidence 3asustainable development 3avegetation 3avesicular arbuscular mycorrhizae 3aChina 0aArbuscular mycorrhizal fungi 0aSoil organic carbon fractions 0aRevegetation type 0aMining subsidence1 aXiao, Li1 aGuo, Chen1 aChristie, Peter0 tCatena.g2020 Dec., v. 195 p.104791-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6271x0341-81627nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.catena.2020.1047913Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03291naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005500150245011700205300001800322520122800340592002801568650001601596650002201612650001401634650001401648650003601662650004601698650001501744650003001759650001001789650001801799650001001817650001201827650002001839650002101859650001201880650002301892650001001915650001401925650004401939650001401983650002201997650005202019650002402071700001702095700001602112700001202128700001802140700005502158700001702213700001702230700001902247700001802266700005502284700005802339773017502397856008402572852000902656655001202665IND60674322720221118221710.0191025e20190906xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067432272DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jnatprod.9b001882doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQiao, Yuben1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8881-123210aAsperpyridone A: An Unusual Pyridone Alkaloid Exerts Hypoglycemic Activity through the Insulin Signaling Pathway  ap. 2925-2930.  aA pyridone alkaloid, asperpyridone A (1), which possesses an unusual pyrano[3,2-c]pyridine scaffold, was isolated from solid cultures of the endophytic fungus Aspergillus sp. TJ23. Its structure, including its absolute configuration, was determined using a combination of nuclear magnetic resonance, high-resolution electrospray ionization mass spectrometry, quantum chemical calculations (electronic circular dichroism), and X-ray crystallography. In vitro bioassays demonstrated that asperpyridone A (1) could function as a potential hypoglycemic agent, which exhibited pronounced glucose uptake effect in liver HepG2 cells, under both normal and insulin-resistant conditions, with higher efficacy than metformin. The underlying mechanism of asperpyridone A was elucidated by analyzing the genes expressed, the Gene Ontology (GO) function enrichment, the protein interaction network, and real-time quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, which suggested that asperpyridone A exhibits hypoglycemic activity by activating the insulin signaling pathway. Moreover, on the basis of the hypoglycemic potency, fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) was determined to be a potential target for asperpyridone A.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAspergillus 3aX-ray diffraction 3aalkaloids 3abioassays 3acircular dichroism spectroscopy 3aelectrospray ionization mass spectrometry 3aendophytes 3afibroblast growth factors 3afungi 3agene ontology 3agenes 3aglucose 3aglycemic effect 3ahuman cell lines 3ainsulin 3ainsulin resistance 3aliver 3ametformin 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3apyridones 3aquantum mechanics 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3asignal transduction1 aXu, Qianqian1 aFeng, Wenya1 aTao, Li1 aLi, Xiao-Nian1 aLiu, Junjun1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9953-86331 aZhu, Hucheng1 aLu, Yuanyuan1 aWang, Jianping1 aQi, Changxing1 aXue, Yongbo1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9133-64391 aZhang, Yonghui1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7222-21420 tJournal of natural products.g2019 Sept. 06, v. 82, no. 10 p.2925-2930dAmerican Chemical Society and American Society of PharmacognosywJournal:jnl11422x1520-60257nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jnatprod.9b001883Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03522naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100006600139245015500205300001800360500002000378520167700398592002802075596007402103650002002177650000802197650002002205650002102225650002402246650000802270650002202278650001102300650001502311650001402326650000902340650001002349650001502359650001502374650002402389650002302413650001202436650001402448650001202462650002102474650001402495650002202509650002402531650001602555700005702571700006502628700005902693773012202752856007302874852000902947655001202956IND60701653120221121132547.0200712e202008  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070165312DNAL7 a10.1111/are.146552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRoessler, Tanja Yvonne1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3692-741710aGrowth performance and RNA/DNA ratio of noble crayfish (Astacus astacus) and narrow‐clawed crayfish (Pontastacus leptodactylus) fed fish waste diets  ap. 3205-3215.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aNew and viable species for aquaponics and integrated multi‐trophic aquaculture (IMTA) in freshwater systems can improve yields and sustainability of aquaculture. Freshwater crayfish species such as Astacus astacus and Pontastacus leptodactylus are omnivorous feeders and considered candidates for feeding on faecal matters in existing aquaculture systems. Feeding trials were conducted to determine growth response and RNA/DNA ratio in freshwater crayfish fed fish waste. Carapace length and wet weight were measured to determine the growth response. Juvenile A. astacus was fed faeces of hybrid striped bass (Morone chrysops × Morone saxatilis) and rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss), while adult P. leptodactylus was fed with two commercial pellet diets and pikeperch (Sander lucioperca) faeces. The nutritional composition of hybrid striped bass faeces was close to optimal diet composition of A. astacus, and crayfish showed significantly higher carapace growth, weight gain and weight gain per moult as the group fed rainbow trout faeces. The growth of P. leptodactylus was significantly lower in terms of weight gain and weight gain percentage per moult for crayfish fed on pikeperch faeces. Thus, this study can recommend a co‐cultivation of hybrid striped bass and A. astacus within one system, but cannot recommend co‐cultivation of P. leptodactylus with pikeperch. Additionally, this study showed controversial results of RNA/DNA ratio and weight gain of both crayfish species. Thus, RNA/DNA ratio cannot be approved for investigations on crayfish physiological status in controlled feeding experiments if animals are fed with an inadequate diet.  aPublisher supplied data  aZF4010504CS5cGerman Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy 3aAstacus astacus 3aDNA 3aMorone chrysops 3aMorone saxatilis 3aOncorhynchus mykiss 3aRNA 3aSander lucioperca 3aadults 3aaquaponics 3acoculture 3adiet 3afeces 3afish waste 3afreshwater 3afreshwater crayfish 3agrowth performance 3ahybrids 3ajuveniles 3amolting 3anutrient content 3aomnivores 3aoptimal nutrition 3aphysiological state 3aweight gain1 aWirtz, Andrea1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2498-81351 aSlater, Matthew James1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8588-544X1 aHenjes, Joachim1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6688-88020 tAquaculture research.g2020 Aug., v. 51, no. 8 p.3205-3215dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl53865x1355-557X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/are.146553Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03461naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245007000171300001600241520195400257592002802211650002802239650002002267650001402287650002002301650001502321650002402336650002202360650001102382650001402393653003002407653002302437653001802460653000902478653000802487653002002495700006202515700002002577700005502597700005602652700002102708700006202729773010502791856008602896852000902982655001202991IND60615941320221118075727.0190318e201811  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061594132DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhydrol.2018.09.0572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShaghaghi, Saba10aStable alluvial channel design using evolutionary neural networks  ap. 770-782.  aAccurate prediction of the long-term average dimensions of alluvial stable channels is a significant problem in river engineering. The goal of this research is to investigate the effect of flow discharge (Q), mean sediment size (d50) and Shields parameter (τ∗) on the stable channel dimensions by employing non-linear regression (NLR) and two Artificial Intelligence (AI) methods, including: Generalized Structure of Group Method of Data Handling (GS-GMDH) neural network and Gene Expression Programming (GEP). Discharge, grain size and Shields parameter from 85 gaging stations situated in three stable Iranian rivers were used as input data for the three methods to estimate the water-surface width (W), average flow depth (D) and longitudinal slope (S) of the rivers. Based on the results, it was found that the GS-GMDH produced more accurate results for simulating the channel width with a Mean Absolute Relative Error (MARE) value of 0.055; and GEP produced better estimations for channel depth and slope with MARE values of 0.035 and 0.03, respectively. Furthermore, by employing Artificial Intelligence (AI) methods (GS-GMDH and GEP), the RMSE values decreased by 22%, 25% and 75% in predicting width, depth, and slope, respectively, compared to NLR method. The overall results showed that the AI methods generally produced better estimations than the non-linear regression method. To determine the effect of each input variable (Q, d50, τ∗) on the target variables (W, D, S), a sensitivity analysis comprising various combinations of input variables was conducted. Based on the results, the flow discharge had a dominant role on depth and width estimation of stable channels. In slope estimation, the most important parameter was τ∗ and then d50, while the discharge had a weak effect on slope prediction. In general, the Shields parameter was the most effective parameter in depth and specially slope estimation of stable channels.  aPublisher supplied data 3aartificial intelligence 3agene expression 3ahydrology 3aneural networks 3aprediction 3aregression analysis 3ariver engineering 3arivers 3asediments 0aStable channel dimensions 0aHydraulic geometry 0aRegime rivers 0aGMDH 0aGEP 0aNeural networks1 aBonakdari, Hossein1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6169-36541 aGholami, Azadeh1 aKisi, Ozgur1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7847-58721 aShiri, Jalal1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5726-79241 aBinns, Andrew D.1 aGharabaghi, Bahram1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0454-28110 tJournal of hydrology.g2018 Nov., v. 566 p.770-782dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl46539x0022-16947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2018.09.0573Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03275naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245009600167500001900263520169300282592002801975650002202003650001202025650001902037650001502056650002302071650002102094650002002115650001502135650001702150650002102167650001502188650001202203650001102215651001002226653001802236653001702254653003102271653002202302653002602324700005302350700006402403700005602467700001902523700001702542700001702559773008702576856008502663852000902748655001202757IND60704577320221120055705.0201025e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070457732DNAL7 a10.1016/j.catena.2020.1047932doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXie, Meizhen10aSeasonal variations of nitrogen in permafrost-affected soils of the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe largest permafrost area in China is on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (QTP), and the nitrogen biogeochemical cycles in this area have received significant attention. However, there is insufficient knowledge of the available soil nitrogen and microbial biomass nitrogen (MBN) dynamics in this region, which hinders our understanding of the changes in the ecosystem and the effects of climate change on the nitrogen dynamics in the future. In this study, we determined the monthly changes in ammonium nitrogen, nitrate nitrogen, dissolved organic nitrogen (DON), and MBN contents of the topsoil (at depths of 0–20 cm) from April 2016 to March 2017 in the permafrost region on the QTP. The results show that soil NH₄⁺-N and DON contents decreased during the growing season, while soil NO₃–-N content increased during the growing season and in the middle of the winter. The soil MBN contents increased at the beginning of the growing season and decreased during peak growth period, despite significant variations among the different sites. The soil temperature was positively correlated with soil NO₃–-N content but it was negatively correlated with the NH₄⁺-N and DON contents. The soil moisture was positively correlated with the soil NO₃–-N, DON, and MBN contents. The primary factor affecting the seasonal patterns in soil NO₃–-N and DON contents was soil moisture. Soil moisture and plant growth also affected soil MBN via nutrient competition. The nutrient uptake by plants overwhelmed effect of temperature on the MBN in growing season. These findings improve our understanding of the nitrogen biochemical cycles and their response to future climate change.  aPublisher supplied data 3aammonium nitrogen 3acatenas 3aclimate change 3aecosystems 3amicrobial nitrogen 3anitrate nitrogen 3anutrient uptake 3apermafrost 3aplant growth 3asoil temperature 3asoil water 3atopsoil 3awinter 3aChina 0aSoil ammonium 0aSoil nitrate 0aDissolved organic nitrogen 0aMicrobial biomass 0aEnvironmental factors1 aZhao, Lin1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0245-84131 aWu, Xiaodong,d1979-1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4519-83781 aTian, Liming1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1773-80741 aYue, Guangyang1 aZhou, Huayun1 aWu, Zhenming0 tCatena.g2020 Dec., v. 195 p.104793-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6271x0341-81627nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.catena.2020.1047933Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02570naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002600140245010800166300002000274520120900294592002801503650001901531650001401550650001401564650002101578650001301599650002401612650001501636650001401651650001401665650002201679700001901701700001301720700002101733700001201754700001901766700002101785700001901806700002001825700002401845700001601869773014401885856007402029852000902103655001202112IND60641839320221119072423.0190506e20160817xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064183932DNAL7 a10.1039/c6ta05088c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aṬāhir, Muḥammad,10aEfficient water oxidation through strongly coupled graphitic C₃N₄ coated cobalt hydroxide nanowires  ap. 12940-12946.  aThe development of low cost and durable electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) for water splitting remains a great challenge. Here, we developed strongly coupled hybrid nanowires (NWs) of anion (Cl⁻ and CO⁻) doped cobalt hydroxide coated with nanosheets of graphitic carbon nitride (Co(OH)₂@g-C₃N₄) through an in situ hydrothermal method. With 5% g-C₃N₄ added in the synthesis, we obtained perfectly coated Co(OH)₂ by g-C₃N₄ nanosheets with an overall diameter of ∼110 nm and a coating layer of ∼10 nm. The structural and compositional analyses confirm the strong interaction between g-C₃N₄ and Co(OH)₂ that makes the hybrid highly effective for the OER. As a result Co(OH)₂@g-C₃N₄ NWs exhibit an excellent over-potential of 0.32 V at 10 mA cm⁻² as well as extraordinary stability, which are better than those of the state-of-the-art noble metals (IrO₂ and RuO₂) and most reported Co- and C₃N₄-based electrocatalysts although both Co(OH)₂ and g-C₃N₄ separately display very fair performance. Furthermore, a combination of Co(OH)₂@g-C₃N₄ and Pt/C delivers a current density of 80 mA cm⁻² at 1.9 V for overall water splitting.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon nitride 3acatalysts 3achlorides 3aelectrochemistry 3agraphene 3ahot water treatment 3ananosheets 3ananowires 3aoxidation 3aoxygen production1 aMahmood, Nasir1 aPan, Lun1 aHuang, Zhen-Feng1 aLv, Zhe1 aZhang, Jingwen1 aButt, Faheem.

The commercial diet with 0.03% inorganic trace mineral (ITM) premix was used as the control, and other four experimental isonitrogenous (50% crude protein) and isolipidic (12% crude lipid) diets were formulated to contain 0.0375%, 0.075%, 0.1125% and 0.15% OTM mixture respectively. Results showed that there were no significant differences in survival among dietary treatments. However, the growth was not significantly different between the control and OTM supplementation diets. Especially, turbot fed the diet with 0.075% OTM had significantly higher specific growth rate than 0.15%, 0.1125% and 0.0375% OTM treatments (p < .05). Moisture, crude protein, crude lipid and ash of the whole fish body showed no significant differences among dietary treatments. Activities of superoxide dismutase in serum of turbot fed diets with 0.1125% and 0.15% OTM were significantly higher than 0.0375% OTM treatment (p < .05). Activities of total antioxidant capacity and catalase in serum were the highest, while the malondialdehyde content was the lowest when the turbot were fed the diet with 0.075% OTM. In summary, results of the present study suggested that the supplementation of 0.0375% or more OTM in diets could obtain similar performance to the commercial diet with ITM premix, and the optimal amount of OTM supplementation in diets of turbot was approximately 0.075% on basis of growth performance and antioxidant capacity.  aPublisher supplied data  cAlltech–Ocean University of China Research Alliance 3aScophthalmus maximus 3aantioxidant activity 3ablood serum 3abody composition 3acatalase 3acrude protein 3adiet 3aenzyme activity 3agrowth performance 3ajuveniles 3alipid content 3alipids 3amalondialdehyde 3aspecific growth rate 3asuperoxide dismutase 3atrace elements 3aturbot1 aLi, Yicong1 aLiu, Yongtao1 aZhao, Zengqi1 aXu, Dan1 aChen, Qiuchi1 aLi, Qingfei1 aLi, Mingzhu1 aLin, Gang1 aMai, Kangsen1 aAi, Qinghui1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3958-474X1 aXu, Wei0 tAquaculture research.g2020 Aug., v. 51, no. 8 p.3421-3428dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl53865x1355-557X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/are.146773Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03399naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245012400168500001900292520191100311592002802222650002402250650001502274650002602289650001102315650001302326650001502339650002002354650001902374650001702393650001002410650003702420650001002457653003302467653003102500653002002531700001702551700001702568700001402585700001702599700001602616700001802632700001402650700001402664700001602678773010502694856008502799852000902884655001202893IND60697075720221122171441.0200824e202011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069707572DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apsoil.2020.1036722doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Haishui10aMycorrhizal nitrogen uptake of wheat is increased by earthworm activity only under no-till and straw removal conditions  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aA large part of crop nutrient uptake occurs through the interaction of roots with symbiotic arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF). However, it is still an open question how straw management and earthworm activity affect AMF community structure and their nitrogen-transferring function in wheat. A split-plot field experiment was conducted to address this question. Three straw management regimes including different tillage treatments (no-till with no straw, NTNS; rotary tillage with straw return, RTSR and ditch-buried straw return, DBSR), and two earthworm treatments (no earthworm, −E; and earthworm addition, +E) were conducted. The AMF community structure in the wheat roots was characterized with high-throughput sequencing, and its function in terms of N acquisition was measured with ¹⁵N isotope tracing through hyphal in-growth cores. Our results showed that both the DBSR and RTSR treatments significantly changed AMF community composition and enhanced the mycorrhiza-mediated plant N uptake when compared to NTNS. The effect of earthworm activity on AMF community composition and mycorrhiza-mediated N uptake strongly depended on the straw management regimes. While earthworm presence increased AMF dominance (+32.9%) and mycorrhizal N uptake (+2.05-fold) under straw removal, they decreased AMF dominance (−30.4% and −41.9% respectively) and mycorrhizal N uptake (−37.3% and −34.3% respectively) under both DBSR and RTSR treatments in comparison with the absence of earthworms. It is concluded that straw addition shifts the AMF community structure and increases N uptake by the host plants; and that the effect of earthworms on AMF community structure and functioning depends on the straw management regime. The results suggest that straw management and its interaction with earthworms can affect mycorrhiza-mediated plant N uptake, possibly through altering some dominant AMF taxa.  aPublisher supplied data 3acommunity structure 3aearthworms 3afield experimentation 3ahyphae 3anitrogen 3ano-tillage 3anutrient uptake 3arotary tillage 3asoil ecology 3astraw 3avesicular arbuscular mycorrhizae 3awheat 0aArbuscular mycorrhizal fungi 0aCrop residue incorporation 0aNitrogen uptake1 aZhou, Jiajia1 aWeih, Martin1 aLi, Yifan1 aZhai, Silong1 aZhang, Qian1 aChen, Weiping1 aLiu, Jian1 aLiu, Ling1 aHu, Shuijin0 tApplied soil ecology.g2020 Nov., v. 155 p.103672-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl55717x0929-13937nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apsoil.2020.1036723Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01755naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002000149245009200169300001800261520072900279592002801008650001201036650001901048650001401067650002101081650001801102650001501120650001801135700001701153700002701170700002301197773010301220856008501323852000901408655001201417IND60532677420221121023717.0160728e20160621xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053267742DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.biochem.6b004182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAnand, Bibin

We found that amyloid formation of BSA was strongly suppressed in the presence of AgNPsCᵃᵖ. However, isolated capsaicin and uncapped control nanoparticles did not show such an inhibition effect. Bioinformatics analysis reveals CH−π and H-bonding interactions between capsaicin and BSA in the formation of the protein–ligand complex. These results suggest the significance of surface functionalization of nanoparticles with capsaicin, which probably allows capsaicin to effectively interact with the key residues of the amyloidogenic core of BSA.  aPublisher supplied data 3aamyloid 3abioinformatics 3acapsaicin 3ahydrogen bonding 3ananoparticles 3ananosilver 3aserum albumin1 aDubey, Kriti1 aShekhawat, Dolat Singh1 aKar, Karuṇākar,0 tBiochemistry.g2016 June 21, v. 55, no. 24 p.3345-3348dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-49957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.biochem.6b004183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02858naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001700144245007200161300001600233500001500249520148600264592002801750650001301778650001901791650001801810650001801828650001501846650001901861650001001880650001201890650001501902650001001917650002301927650001701950650002101967651001301988653003602001653002502037653002502062653001502087653001602102700002102118700003202139773011802171856007802289852000902367655001202376IND60515879920221120081537.0160321e20140415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051587992DNAL7 a10.1139/cjfr-2014-00172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBinkley, Dan10aAge structure of aspen forests on the Uncompahgre Plateau, Colorado  ap. 836-841.  a2019-12-06  aAspen forests are one of the most dynamic forest types in western North America, responding to chronic factors of competition for resources, as well as episodes of intense herbivory, drought, and fires. The interactions of these driving factors lead to varying age structures of aspen across landscapes and through time. We characterized the age structure of aspen trees on the Uncompahgre Plateau in western Colorado, USA, to inform collaborative efforts of landscape-scale forest restoration. Over 1000 cores from 51 locations showed few aspen older than 140 years (<0.5% for aspen numbers, <2.5% of aspen basal area). Heavy recruitment in the late 1800s (following the last major fires) led to cohorts from 100 to 140 years of age that account for 15% of current aspen numbers and 40% of current aspen basal area. Perhaps the most important character of the current age structure is a relatively low number of aspen younger than 50 years; normal rates of tree survivorship in coming decades will lead to a substantial decline in aspen on the Plateau as these cohorts progress into older age classes. Patterns of aspen ages on the Uncompahgre Plateau differ substantially from those on the Kaibab Plateau and in Rocky Mountain National Park, owing the varying importance in space and time of driving factors. Landscape-scale increases in aspen regeneration (from major events such as fire) would be necessary to moderate the long-term decline in aspen on the Uncompahgre Plateau.  aPublisher supplied data 3aplateaus 3anational parks 3asurvival rate 3aage structure 3alandscapes 3aspace and time 3afires 3adrought 3aherbivores 3atrees 3aforest restoration 3aforest types 3astand basal area 3aColorado 0alandscape-scale forest analysis 0aforest age structure 0asudden aspen decline 0abasal area 0afire regime1 aAlsanousi, Attia1 aRomme, W.

With regard to efficient photocatalysis, apart from charge separation, possessing sufficient thermodynamic abilities are the prerequisites so that the photogenerated electrons and holes can induce redox reactions. For most visible-light-responsive semiconductor photocatalysts, photogenerated holes exhibit strong oxidation ability because of their appropriate valence band top levels. However, the ability of the photogenerated electrons to induce reduction reactions is weak, generally due to their low conduction band bottom levels. Hence, a feasible strategy would involve the rational construction of a heterojunctional system with thermodynamically appropriate energy platforms as a space-separated electron shuttle for further intensifying the reduction reactions for efficient visible-light photocatalysis. Obviously, it is considerably meaningful to develop an appropriate electron energy platform-dependent efficient heterojunctional photocatalyst under visible-light irradiation and to review recent developments in this field. In this review, special emphasis is paid to bridged heterojunction-related advances made by our group, focusing upon visible-light-responsive single-metal oxides like Fe₂O₃, bimetal oxides like BiVO₄, plasmonic noble-metal nanoparticles like Au, and polymer-based nanomaterials like g-C₃N₄ as model photocatalysts. Apparently, it is imperative to design efficient nanophotocatalysts for fields related to energy production and environmental remediation from the scientific and engineering points of view.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon nitride 3aclean energy 3aelectrons 3aenergy 3aferric oxide 3afossil fuels 3agold 3airradiation 3amodels 3ananocomposites 3ananogold 3ananoparticles 3aoxidation 3aphotocatalysis 3aphotocatalysts 3apollution 3aremediation 3asemiconductors 3asustainable technology 3athermodynamics1 aBai, Linlu1 aLi, Zhijun1 aQu, Yang1 aJing, Liqiang0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2019 May 7, v. 7, no. 18 p.10879-10897dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c9ta02373a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04351naa a2200901 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100006400150245015300214300001800367500001400385520166900399592002802068650001102096650000902107650001202116650002802128650001902156650002402175650002202199650000902221650001202230650002002242650001602262650001002278650001802288650001502306650002302321650003602344650001402380650001302394650001502407650002402422650000902446651001102455651000902466651001002475653003002485653001502515653001902530653000902549653000702558653000902565653000702574653000802581653000702589653000702596653000702603653000702610653001002617653000902627653001302636653000802649653001002657653000902667653000802676653000702684653000702691653000802698653000702706700005902713700002102772700002002793700002302813700006302836700002002899700002202919700002002941700001802961700002102979773034303000856008503343852000903428655001203437IND60697075820221122145328.0200824e20200828xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069707582DNAL7 a10.1016/j.numecd.2020.05.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDalla Zuanna, Teresa1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1244-404X10aAvoidable hospitalisation for diabetes mellitus among immigrants and natives: Results from the Italian Network for Longitudinal Metropolitan Studies  ap. 1535-1543.  aNAL-light  aItaly has experienced a relevant increase in migration inflow over the last 20 years. Although the Italian Health Service is widely accessible, immigrants can face many barriers that limit their use of health services. Diabetes mellitus (DM) has a different prevalence across ethnic groups, but studies focusing on DM care among immigrants in Europe are scarce. This study aimed to compare the rates of avoidable hospitalisation (AH) between native and immigrant adults in Italy.A multi-centre open cohort study including all 18- to 64-year-old residents in Turin, Venice, Reggio-Emilia, Modena, Bologna and Rome between 01/01/2001 and 31/12/2013–14 was conducted. Italian citizens were compared with immigrants from high migratory pressure countries who were further divided by their area of origin. We calculated age-, sex- and calendar year-adjusted rate ratios (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) of AH for DM by citizenship using negative binomial regression models. The RRs were summarized using a random effects meta-analysis. The results showed higher AH rates among immigrant males (RR: 1.63, 95% CI: 1.16–2.23), whereas no significant difference was found for females (RR: 1.14, 95% CI: 0.65–1.99). Immigrants from Asia and Africa showed a higher risk than Italians, whereas those from Central-Eastern Europe and Central-Southern America did not show any increased risk.Adult male immigrants were at higher risk of experiencing AH for DM than Italians, with differences by area of origin, suggesting that they may experience lower access to and lower quality of primary care for DM. These services should be improved to reduce disparities.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadults 3aarea 3abologna 3acardiovascular diseases 3acohort studies 3aconfidence interval 3adiabetes mellitus 3aface 3afemales 3ahealth services 3aimmigration 3amales 3ameta-analysis 3ametabolism 3amigratory behavior 3anationalities and ethnic groups 3anutrition 3apressure 3aprevalence 3aregression analysis 3arisk 3aAfrica 3aAsia 3aItaly 0aAvoidable hospitalisation 0aImmigrants 0aSocioeconomics 0aACSC 0aAH 0aAHRQ 0aCE 0aCHR 0aCI 0aCS 0aDM 0aEU 0aHbA1c 0aHMPC 0aIN-LiMeS 0aIPD 0aISTAT 0aLMPC 0aPHC 0aPY 0aRR 0aSHR 0aUS1 aCacciani, Laura1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5800-32851 aBarbieri, Giulia1 aFerracin, Elisa1 aZengarini, Nicolas1 aDi Girolamo, Chiara1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6031-10091 aCaranci, Nicola1 aPetrelli, Alessio1 aMarino, Claudia1 aAgabiti, Nera1 aCanova, Cristina0 tNutrition, metabolism, and cardiovascular diseases.g2020 Aug. 28, v. 30, no. 9 p.1535-1543dElsevier B.V.aThe Italian Diabetes Society, the Italian Society for the Study of Atherosclerosis, the Italian Society of Human Nutrition and the Department of Clinical Medicine and Surgery, Federico II UniversitywJournal:11953x0939-47537nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.numecd.2020.05.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02540naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002500146245011500171300001800286520117600304650001501480650002001495650001401515650001601529650001101545650004401556650002501600650002901625650001501654650001801669650001001687650001501697700002001712700002401732700002501756700002101781700002201802700001701824700001901841700001601860773016201876856004702038852000902085655001202094IND60522203020221119181547.0160602e20160323xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052220302DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jafc.5b058782doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGarcia-Perez, Isabel13aAn Analytical Pipeline for Quantitative Characterization of Dietary Intake: Application To Assess Grape Intake  ap. 2423-2431.  aLack of accurate dietary assessment in free-living populations requires discovery of new biomarkers reflecting food intake qualitatively and quantitatively to objectively evaluate effects of diet on health. We provide a proof-of-principle for an analytical pipeline to identify quantitative dietary biomarkers. Tartaric acid was identified by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy as a dose-responsive urinary biomarker of grape intake and subsequently quantified in volunteers following a series of 4-day dietary interventions incorporating 0 g/day, 50 g/day, 100 g/day, and 150 g/day of grapes in standardized diets from a randomized controlled clinical trial. Most accurate quantitative predictions of grape intake were obtained in 24 h urine samples which have the strongest linear relationship between grape intake and tartaric acid excretion (r2 = 0.90). This new methodological pipeline for estimating nutritional intake based on coupling dietary intake information and quantified nutritional biomarkers was developed and validated in a controlled dietary intervention study, showing that this approach can improve the accuracy of estimating nutritional intakes. 3abiomarkers 3aclinical trials 3aexcretion 3afood intake 3agrapes 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3anutrition assessment 3anutritional intervention 3aprediction 3atartaric acid 3aurine 3avolunteers1 aPosma, Joram M.1 aChambers, Edward S.1 aNicholson, Jeremy K.1 aMathers, John C.1 aBeckmann, Manfred1 aDraper, John1 aHolmes, Elaine1 aFrost, Gary0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2016 Mar. 23, v. 64, no. 11 p.2423-2431dAmerican Chemical Society, Books and Journals Divisionx0021-85617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jafc.5b05878  aDNAL 7aarticle03154naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002300139245014100162300001800303500002000321520141000341592002801751650002001779650002301799650001601822650001901838650001101857650002601868650002101894650001601915650002401931650002201955650001401977650001201991650001602003650001002019650002402029650001102053650002402064650001402088650001802102650001102120650001002131650001202141650001202153650001002165650001202175700006102187700002702248700002002275700007702295773012202372856007302494852000902567655001202576IND60701653520221121044051.0200712e202008  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070165352DNAL7 a10.1111/are.146592doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aManzoor, Peer Saba10aDietary lipid influences gonadal maturation, digestive enzymes and serum biochemical indices of Cyprinus carpio reared in biofloc system  ap. 3244-3254.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aAn experiment was conducted for 120 days to evaluate optimum dietary lipid requirements for gonadal maturation of Cyprinus carpio fed with varying dietary lipid levels under biofloc‐based systems (BFT). About 180 fingerlings (22 g ± 0.05) were randomly distributed in 15 tanks (300 L) at the rate of 48 no./m² and fed with varying lipid levels (T1—4% lipid with BFT, T2—6% lipid with BFT, T3—8% lipid with BFT, T4—10% lipid with BFT, control—10% lipid without BFT). The C/N ratio of 20:1 was maintained using tapioca flour as carbon source. Biofloc units supplemented with 8% dietary lipid (T3) showed advanced maturation in terms of absolute fecundity (9,913 ± 7.62), relative fecundity (229.0/g ± 11.92), gonadosomatic index (24.47% ± 1.27), hepatosomatic index (1.97% ± 0.07), condition factor (0.02 g/cm³ ± 0.00) compared with control (clear water with 10% lipid) (p < .05). Histological observations of gonads also revealed that the biofloc groups with supplementation of 8% dietary lipid promoted gonadal maturation for female oocyte and 6% dietary lipid promoted maturation for males, compared with control (clear water with 10% lipid). The results obtained in this experiment elucidate that the biofloc improves gonadal maturation of common carp broodstock at a dietary supplementation with 8% lipid compared with conventional system of broodstock management.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCyprinus carpio 3abiofloc technology 3ablood serum 3abreeding stock 3acarbon 3acarbon nitrogen ratio 3acondition factor 3adietary fat 3adietary supplements 3adigestive enzymes 3afecundity 3afemales 3afingerlings 3aflour 3agonadosomatic index 3agonads 3ahepatosomatic index 3ahistology 3alipid content 3alipids 3amales 3aoocytes 3arearing 3atanks 3atapioca1 aRawat, Kiran Dube1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0408-19311 aTiwari, Virendra Kumar1 aPoojary, Nalini1 aAsanaru Majeedkutty, Babitha Rani1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6738-17390 tAquaculture research.g2020 Aug., v. 51, no. 8 p.3244-3254dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl53865x1355-557X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/are.146593Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01708naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002300151245012400174300001600298520051400314592002800828650001600856650002200872650001600894650003400910651001300944651001200957653001600969653002000985653001301005653001701018653001501035653001601050653001201066700002201078700002301100773009301123856008501216852000901301655001201310IND60560817420221121015432.0170110e20161001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056081742DNAL7 a10.1080/0269249X.2016.12536172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGlushchenko, Anton10aAulacoseira konstastinovii sp. nov. and Aulacoseira krylovii sp. nov. – two new centric diatoms from South-east Asia  ap. 367-378.  aTwo new centric diatom species were found in samples collected from Vietnam and Cambodia, Aulacoseira konstantinovii sp. nov. and Aulacoseira krylovii sp. nov.

Group 1 (GPG+P4; n=330), received gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH) I/M on Day 0, a progesterone (P4)-releasing intravaginal device from Days 0–7, prostaglandin F ₂α (PGF) I/M on Day 7 and a second dose of GnRH at the time of FTAI on Day 9. The second group (P4+PGF; n=343) received a P4-releasing intravaginal device from Days 0–7, PGF on Day 6 and FTAI on Day 9. Pregnancy was diagnosed from Days 42–52 by transrectal ultrasonography. RESULTS: The overall conception rate was 52.4% and 54.8% for the GPG+P4 and P4+PGF groups, respectively. The odds of conception for the two treatments were not different (OR=0.90; 95% CI=0.67–1.23), nor was there any difference between groups in different years (p=0.58). Farm affected conception rate (p=0.002), but there was no interaction with treatment (p=0.92) . CONCLUSIONS: This study has shown that an alternative synchronisation programme can produce similar results in terms of conception rate to the GPG+P4 treatment, currently commonly used in heifers. More research is required to establish whether other modifications to the GPG+P4 programme can produce similar results at lower costs, and to identify and quantify farm factors which affect the economic benefit of heifer synchronisation. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: This study indicated that synchronising heifers with P4 and PGF resulted in conception rates equivalent to those resulting from a GPG+P4 treatment, but with reduced drug costs. However, because heifers in the GPG+P4 group received the second GnRH injection at the time of AI, they needed only three yardings as opposed to the four required for the heifers treated with P4 and PGF. Thus, the choice of programme for an individual farm will depend on that farm's circumstances, in particular the cost of yarding the heifers.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHolstein 3aartificial insemination 3aconception rate 3adairy heifers 3adrugs 3aestrus 3afarms 3agonadotropin-releasing hormone 3aintravaginal devices 3apregnancy 3aprogesterone 3aprostaglandins 3aultrasonography 3aNew Zealand 0aOestrus synchronisation 0aheifer 0aconception rate 0aGPG 0aprogesterone1 aParkinson, TJ1 aLaven, RA0 tNew Zealand veterinary journal.g2015 May 4, v. 63, no. 3 p.158-161dTaylor & Francisx1176-07107nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00480169.2014.9827403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02766naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001200153245012200165300002000287520140400307592002801711650001601739650001101755650003101766650002101797650001701818650001101835650001901846650001201865650002101877650001701898650001701915650001601932700001701948700005401965700001402019700001402033700001902047700001702066700001802083773012202101856008802223852000902311655001202320IND60756860020221120075109.0211118e20211106xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075686002DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.energyfuels.1c028502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDu, Bin10aDiethanolamine-Assisted Preparation of Reed Flower-Derived Nitrogen-Doped Porous Carbon for Supercapacitor Electrodes  ap. 18789-18797.  aReed flower (RF)-derived porous carbon-based electrodes are produced with KOH as the activating agent and diethanolamine (DEA) as the additive via a facile method without precarbonization. DEA with good wettability can facilitate the permeation of KOH through plant tissues, thus enhancing the KOH activation and increasing the specific surface area (SSA) as well as the pore volume. In addition, DEA as a nitrogen-doping agent can also increase the nitrogen content of carbon materials. The porous carbon synthesized with DEA (RFAC-N) exhibits a significantly larger SSA of 1691 m² g–¹, an evidently higher pore volume of 1.08 m³ g–¹, and a higher N content (1.93 wt %) than that synthesized without DEA. Examined in a symmetric two-electrode electrochemical test system with KOH as the electrolyte, RFAC-N presents a high specific capacitance (254.3 F g–¹ at a current density of 1 A g–¹), superb rate performance (192.7 F g–¹ at 30 A g–¹), a high energy density of 9.40 Wh kg–¹, good reversibility, and excellent long cycle stability (89.5% capacity retention after 10,000 cycles at 10 A g–¹). Possessing impressive properties and performance, the N-doped biomass-derived porous carbon materials with a high N content, as synthesized with a facile method presented in this work, demonstrate their vast potential in application in high-performance energy storage devices.  aPublisher supplied data 3acapacitance 3acarbon 3aelectrochemical capacitors 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrolytes 3aenergy 3aenergy density 3aflowers 3anitrogen content 3apermeability 3asurface area 3awettability1 aHuang, Lihui1 aShen, Ming1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4813-73191 aZhou, Hui1 aWang, Bin1 aDeng, Zhongyue1 aWang, Liyuan1 aNie, Diandian0 tEnergy & fuels.g2021 Nov. 06, v. 35, no. 22 p.18789-18797dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23338x1520-50297nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.energyfuels.1c028503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04703naa a2200853 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006100148245012200209300001800331520162100349592002801970650002001998650002302018650001202041650002402053650002402077650001802101650001902119650001602138653002602154653000902180653001102189653001102200700002302211700006002234700006002294700002102354700006502375700006202440700005902502700002402561700002402585700002302609700001502632700002002647700002202667700003602689700003002725700002002755700005802775700001902833700002402852700002502876700006002901700001702961700006102978700003003039700002503069700002403094700001603118700005803134700003103192700002503223700002403248700002203272700005603294700001803350700002603368700002103394700001803415700006503433700002903498700002003527700002503547700006003572773011303632856008303745852000903828655001203837IND60749017620221118020820.0210911e202109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074901762DNAL7 a10.1016/j.clnu.2021.08.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCordova, Reynalda1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7781-643310aConsumption of ultra-processed foods associated with weight gain and obesity in adults: A multi-national cohort study  ap. 5079-5088.  aThere is a worldwide shift towards increased consumption of ultra-processed foods (UPF) with concurrent rising prevalence of obesity. We examined the relationship between the consumption of UPF and weight gain and risk of obesity.This prospective cohort included 348 748 men and women aged 25–70 years. Participants were recruited between 1992 and 2000 from 9 European countries in the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) study. Two body weight measures were available, at baseline and after a median follow-up time of 5 years. Foods and drinks were assessed at baseline by dietary questionnaires and classified according to their degree of processing using NOVA classification. Multilevel mixed linear regression was used to estimate the association between UPF consumption and body weight change (kg/5 years). To estimate the relative risk of becoming overweight or obese after 5 years we used Poisson regression stratified according to baseline body mass index (BMI).After multivariable adjustment, higher UPF consumption (per 1 SD increment) was positively associated with weight gain (0·12 kg/5 years, 95% CI 0·09 to 0·15). Comparing highest vs. lowest quintile of UPF consumption was associated with a 15% greater risk (95% CI 1·11, 1·19) of becoming overweight or obese in normal weight participants, and with a 16% greater risk (95% CI 1·09, 1·23) of becoming obese in participants who were overweight at baseline.These results are supportive of public health campaigns to substitute UPF for less processed alternatives for obesity prevention and weight management.  aPublisher supplied data 3abody mass index 3aclinical nutrition 3aobesity 3aprospective studies 3aregression analysis 3arelative risk 3aweight control 3aweight gain 0aUltra-processed foods 0aNOVA 0aEurope 0aAdults1 aKliemann, Nathalie1 aHuybrechts, Inge1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3838-855X1 aRauber, Fernanda1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9693-79541 aVamos, Eszter P.1 aLevy, Renata Bertazzi1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5388-70021 aWagner, Karl-Heinz1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1683-72651 aViallon, Vivian1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9799-44211 aCasagrande, Corinne1 aNicolas, Geneviève1 aDahm, Christina C.1 aZhang, Jie1 aHalkjær, Jytte1 aTjønneland, Anne1 aBoutron-Ruault, Marie-Christine1 aMancini, Francesca Romana1 aLaouali, Nasser1 aKatzke, Verena1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6509-65551 aSrour, Bernard1 aJannasch, Franziska1 aSchulze, Matthias B.1 aMasala, Giovanna1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5758-90691 aGrioni, Sara1 aPanico, Salvatore1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5498-83121 avan der Schouw, Yvonne T.1 aDerksen, Jeroen W.G.1 aRylander, Charlotta1 aSkeie, Guri1 aJakszyn, Paula1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0672-88471 aRodriguez-Barranco, Miguel1 aHuerta, José María1 aBarricarte, Aurelio1 aBrunkwall, Lousie1 aRamne, Stina1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1291-44941 aBodén, Stina1 aPerez-Cornago, Aurora1 aHeath, Alicia K.1 aVineis, Paolo1 aWeiderpass, Elisabete1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2237-01281 aMonteiro, Carlos Augusto1 aGunter, Marc J.1 aMillett, Christopher1 aFreisling, Heinz1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8648-49980 tClinical nutrition.g2021 Sept., v. 40, no. 9 p.5079-5088dElsevier LtdwJournal:J000000059x0261-56147nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.clnu.2021.08.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02887naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001500155245011600170300001600286520167400302592002801976650001602004650001302020650001702033650001002050650001102060650002502071650002402096650001302120653001002133653001102143653002902154653001402183653001302197700001702210700001602227700002702243773010802270856009002378852000902468655001202477IND60558582920221123044048.0190405e201612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055858292DNAL7 a10.1016/j.smallrumres.2016.11.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZamani, P.10aCombination of B-Spline and Legendre functions in random regression models to fit growth curve of Moghani sheep  ap. 115-122.  aRandom regression models (RRMs) were employed to estimate variance components for body weight (BW) records of Moghani sheep from 60 to 365days of age. A total of 9165 BW records of 2811 lambs, collected at a breeding station of Moghani sheep were used in this study. Various combinations of Legendre (Leg) polynomials with 2 and 3 orders of fit and linear and quadratic B-Splines (BS) with 2 or 3 coefficients were fitted for fixed and random regression parts of the RRMs. The models were compared based on Akaike’s and Bayesian Information Criteria. Different combinations of Leg and BS functions had almost similar estimates of variance components as ratios to total phenotypic variance, but the models with Leg polynomials especially in random regression parts had easier convergence and better fitting criteria on average. However, a model fitting quadratic B-Splines with 3 coefficients in fixed regression part and 3, 3, 2 and 2 coefficients for random direct additive genetic, permanent environmental, maternal genetic and maternal environmental effects, respectively was the best model. According to the best model, direct heritability (h2) was estimated in the range of 0.14–0.32 with a decrease from 60 to 120days of age and a subsequent increase to the end of trajectory. Coefficient of permanent environmental effects (p2) was in the range of 0.23–0.61 with an increasing trend throughout the trajectory. Maternal heritability (m2) and coefficient of maternal environment (c2) had low and negligible estimates, respectively. The results of the present study indicated potential of B-Splines for genetic evaluations of body weight in sheep, using RRMs.  aPublisher supplied data 3abody weight 3abreeding 3aheritability 3alambs 3amodels 3aphenotypic variation 3aregression analysis 3avariance 0aSheep 0aGrowth 0aRandom regression models 0aB-Splines 0aLegendre1 aMoradi, M.R.1 aAlipour, D.1 aGhafouri-Kesbi, Farhad0 tSmall ruminant research.g2016 Dec., v. 145 p.115-122dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl44843x0921-44887nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.smallrumres.2016.11.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02682naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002500140245010300165300001600268520140500284592002801689650001401717650001501731650002201746700002101768700002601789700002201815700002201837700002101859700002301880700002301903700001801926700002301944700003001967700002201997700002002019700002202039700002302061773009302084856007402177852000902251655001202260IND60080683920221120215756.0140802e201408  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008068392DNAL7 a10.1111/ecog.005782doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGraham, Catherine H.14aThe origin and maintenance of montane diversity: integrating evolutionary and ecological processes  ap. 711-719.  aDetermining how ecological and evolutionary processes produce spatial variation in local species richness remains an unresolved challenge. Using mountains as a model system, we outline an integrative research approach to evaluate the influence of ecological and evolutionary mechanisms on the generation and maintenance of patterns of species richness along and among elevational gradients. Biodiversity scientists interested in patterns of species richness typically start by documenting patterns of species richness at regional and local scales, and based on their knowledge of the taxon, and the environmental and historical characteristics of a mountain region, they then ask whether diversity–environment relationships, if they exist, are explained mostly by ecological or evolutionary hypotheses. The final step, and perhaps most challenging one, is to tease apart the relative influence of ecological and evolutionary mechanisms. We propose that elucidating the relative influence of ecological and evolutionary mechanisms can be achieved by taking advantage of the replicated settings afforded by mountains, combined with targeted experiments along elevational gradients. This approach will not only identify potential mechanisms that drive patterns of species richness, but also allow scientists to generate more robust hypotheses about which factors generate and maintain local diversity.  aPublisher supplied data 3amountains 3ascientists 3aspecies diversity1 aCarnaval, Ana C.1 aCadena, Carlos Daniel1 aZamudio, Kelly R.1 aRoberts, Trina E.1 aParra, Juan Luis1 aMcCain, Christy M.1 aBowie, Rauri C.

The extraction of these two parameters traditionally follows the procedure of conducting frequency or temperature differentiation of the raw admittance, identifying positions of the defect-signature peak, constructing an Arrhenius plot using the peak positions, and extracting Eₐ and ν₀ by line fitting. We present a suite of Arrhenius transformations to transform and match the isorate and isothermal scans, carried out at a fixed point of the two-dimensional temperature–rate experimental space, onto one of the four virtual spaces: activation energy, the attempt-to-escape frequency, temperature, and rate. We match the Arrhenius-transformed scans to each other to extract Eₐ and ν₀ using only the raw capacitance and conductance data without taking the frequency/temperature derivative or using the Arrhenius plot.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactivation energy 3acapacitance 3aphysical chemistry 3asemiconductors 3aspectroscopy 3atemperature0 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2021 Jan. 29, v. 125, no. 5 p.2860-2865dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23573x1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.0c108533Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03245naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001300139245016000152300001600312520162400328592002801952650001301980650002301993650002202016650003502038650001302073650001902086650002302105650001102128650001002139650001502149650001502164650002102179650001702200650001202217650001102229650001402240650000902254650001002263650002602273650001202299650001602311650001002327651001902337700001402356700001502370700002202385700002302407700001502430700001602445700001802461700001702479773011002496856004002606852000902646655001202655IND50061989620221118072555.0130320e201301  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006198962DNAL7 a10.1111/aab.120052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aElek, H.14aThe potential of hydroxamic acids in tetraploid and hexaploid wheat varieties as resistance factors against the bird‐cherry oat aphid, Rhopalosiphum padi  ap. 100-109.  aThe potential for exploiting natural wheat resistance to control the cereal aphid Rhopalosiphum padi, the most important aphid pest of small grain cereals in the UK, was investigated as an alternative approach to the use of insecticides. The investigation focussed on a group of secondary metabolites, the hydroxamic acids or benzoxazinones, present naturally as glucosides, but which hydrolyse on tissue damage to give biologically active aglycones, e.g. 2,4‐dihydroxy‐7‐methoxy‐1,4‐benzoxazin‐3‐one (DIMBOA) which are associated with natural plant defence. These can be important for resistance against insects, fungi, bacteria and nematodes for a range of cultivated monocotyledonous plants and could ultimately be combined with other defence mechanisms to provide a general approach to cereal aphid control. Levels of hydroxamic acids, particularly DIMBOA‐glucoside, were determined in hexaploid (Triticum aestivum) and tetraploid (Triticum durum) wheat varieties and differences were found between species and varieties. The effect of feeding by R. padi on the level of hydroxamic acids in the leaf tissue was also investigated. Thus, after 24 h of aphid feeding, as an apparently localised hydrolytic defence reaction in the leaf, levels of DIMBOA‐glucoside decreased noticeably. When aphids were fed on sucrose solution containing low doses of DIMBOA there was a significant mortality compared to the sucrose control. However, the levels of and variation in hydroxamic acids in the wheat varieties investigated were insufficient for significant differences in aphid behaviour and development.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNematoda 3aRhopalosiphum padi 3aTriticum aestivum 3aTriticum turgidum subsp. durum 3abacteria 3abenzoxazinoids 3adefense mechanisms 3adimboa 3afungi 3aglucosides 3ahexaploidy 3ahydroxamic acids 3ainsecticides 3ainsects 3aleaves 3amortality 3aoats 3apests 3asecondary metabolites 3asucrose 3atetraploidy 3awheat 3aUnited Kingdom1 aSmart, L.1 aMartin, J.1 aS.

This study investigated the effects of GABA tea on apoptosis and autophagy in the cerebral cortex of streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic rats. Thirty-four male Wistar rats at 8weeks of age were randomly divided into control group, STZ-induced (60mg/kg, i.p.) diabetes (DM), and DM rats with water GABA tea extracts of containing GABA either 3.01 or 30.1μg/rat per day for 6weeks. Treatment with GABA tea dose-dependently lowered blood glucose level in the diabetic rats compared with vehicle. GABA tea reduced the diabetic-induced Fas-dependent and mitochondrial-dependent apoptotic pathway in the diabetic cerebral cortex compared with vehicle, the evidence for which is based on decreases in Fas, activated caspase-8, pro-apoptotic t-Bid, Bax, cytosolic cytochrome c, activated caspase-9 and activated caspase-3. GABA tea also reduced the diabetic-induced autophagy. The results suggest that GABA tea obviously inhibits diabetic-induced apoptosis in the cerebral cortex through the suppression of Fas and mitochondrial pathways. These findings provide the possible diabetes-related apoptotic and autophagy pathways in the cerebral cortex and suggest that GABA tea treatment has the potential to prevent diabetic brain abnormality.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal disease models 3aapoptosis 3aautophagy 3ablood glucose 3acaspase-3 3acaspase-8 3acaspase-9 3acerebral cortex 3acytochrome c 3adiabetes 3agamma-aminobutyric acid 3amales 3amitochondria 3arats 3astreptozotocin 3atea 3aAsia 0aGABA 0aSTZ 0aDM 0aFADD 0aC 0aEC 0aEGCG 0aLC3 0aGABA tea 0aDiabetes mellitus 0aApoptosis 0aAutophagy1 aKuo, Wei-Wen1 aWang, Hsueh-Fang1 aLin, Cheng-Jyh1 aLin, Yueh-Min1 aChen, Jia-Long1 aKuo, Chia-Hua1 aChen, Ping-Kun1 aLin, Jing-Ying0 tJournal of functional foods.g2014 Jan., v. 6 p.534-544dElsevier LtdwJournal:J000000142x1756-46467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jff.2013.11.0203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02486naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002300155245016400178520108400342592002801426650002301454650002401477650002001501650001501521650001601536650001601552650001001568650001901578650000901597650001901606650001401625650001201639650001001651650001401661650001401675650001001689653002301699653001301722653000901735653001001744653001401754653001801768700002001786773009901806856009001905852000901995655001202004IND60793035220221123033734.0220921e20230115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079303522DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aquaculture.2022.7388132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYigit, Nalan Ozgur10aEfficiency of thyme (Origanum onites) and coriander (Coriandrum sativum) essential oils on anesthesia and histopathology of rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss)  aThe aim of this study was to investigate the anesthetic efficiency of coriander (Coriandrum sativum) and thyme (Origanum onites) essential oils at different concentrations (20, 50, 70, 100, 150, 200, 300, 400, 500, 600 mg L⁻¹) on rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss).

At the end of the experiment, coriander essential oil was observed to be sedative at 50 mg L⁻¹ and had an anesthetic effect at a concentration of 200 mg L⁻¹ in rainbow trout. However, thyme essential oil caused mortality at the tested concentrations in rainbow trout. Histopathological examination, hyperemia, edema and desquamation were observed in the thyme group’ gills. Also, liver and kidney hyperemia was noticed in this group. No pathological findings were observed in any organ of fishes in the coriander group.

At a potential of 0.20 V versus Ag/AgCl, the (2 × 2)-3CO phase is converted into an apparent (1 × 1)-CO adlayer. Upon increasing the potential to 0.25 V, this adlayer first transiently exhibits both a local (1 × 1) lattice as well as a (√19 × √19)R23.4° superlattice before it is gradually transformed into a static (√19 × √19)R23.4°-13CO adlayer with a rotated and expanded adsorbate arrangement. In the transient structure, highly dynamic fluctuations in the adsorbate positions are observed. These results can be rationalized by a microscopic mechanism in which the removal of CO adsorbates leads to highly mobile defects with a local (1 × 1) structure in the (2 × 2)-3CO adlayer. With decreasing CO coverage, a densely packed arrangement of these (1 × 1) clusters with (√19 × √19)R23.4° symmetry is formed, which subsequently rearranges gradually into the (√19 × √19)R23.4°-13CO adlayer.  aPublisher supplied data 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrolytes 3aphase transition1 aChen, Yan-Xia1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1370-74221 aMagnussen, Olaf M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4900-08800 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2021 Jan. 28, v. 125, no. 5 p.3066-3072dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23573x1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.0c108903Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01365naa a2200253 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003600092040001800128100002300146245014000169300001600309520051000325592002800835650001300863650001100876650000900887700002100896773009100917856008201008852000901090655001201099IND4461593120150529000000.0141101e201108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446159312DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tvjl.2011.06.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHedhammar, Åke A.10aRules, regulations, strategies and activities within the Fédération Cynologique Internationale (FCI) to promote canine genetic health  ap. 141-146.  aThe structure and aims of the Fédération Cynologique Internationale (FCI) are outlined, with a focus on the rules and regulations that are relevant to breeding and genetic health of dogs.

Moreover, Ag NEs covered by MoS₂ quantum dots (denoted as Ag@MoS₂ QD NEs) show a more positive bubble formation potential than pure Ag NEs. Furthermore, the kinetic parameters of rate-determining steps for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) were calculated at Ag NEs and Ag@MoS₂ QD NEs by microkinetic analyses. The average value of the standard rate constant (k⁰) of Ag@MoS₂ QD NEs is ∼10-fold of that at Ag NEs, as well as the positive shift of nanobubble formation potential, indicating the higher HER activity of Ag@MoS₂ QDs. Our work will provide a new insight to design and evaluate HER catalysts based on the nanobubble formation.  aPublisher supplied data 3ahydrogen 3ahydrogen production 3ananobubbles 3aphysical chemistry 3avoltammetry1 aWang, Hao1 aTang, Haoran1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4016-84791 aLi, Yongxin1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5543-42420 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2021 Feb. 02, v. 125, no. 5 p.3073-3080dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23573x1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.0c109283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03395naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245016000168500001900328520184400347592002802191650001802219650001502237650001702252650001402269650001702283650001302300650001502313650001102328650002002339650002102359650001702380650001402397650001602411651001702427651001302444653002402457653002902481653002402510653002402534653001502558700001902573700002302592700002202615700002502637773013302662856008502795852000902880655001202889IND60708706620221119113518.0201118e20201201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070870662DNAL7 a10.1016/j.palaeo.2020.1099692doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBialik, Or M.10aSource shifts to periplatform deposits during the early to middle Miocene in response to climatic and oceanographic forcing, Maldives, western Indian Ocean  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aPeriplatform carbonate ooze records a composite signal reflecting both the regional oceanographic state and the development of the adjacent carbonate platform. Deconvolving these signals offers the possibility to obtain a holistic perspective on the factors governing the evolution of the platform, especially when the platform itself is not accessible. Here, we examine a case study from periplatform deposition in Site U1468 on the margins of the Kardiva Platform, Maldives. This site has a well-constrained record with seismic control of the geometric evolution of adjacent carbonate platforms. Here we integrate geochemistry, sedimentology and external constraints to address the relationship between local (platform evolution), regional (nutrient regime) and global (temperature, sea level) effects.The lower to middle Miocene succession at Site U1468 is comprised of a wackestone to packstone sequence that hosts foraminifera and other bioclastic grains, derived from neritic and pelagic sources, as well as biogenic siliceous material such as sponge spicules. The sequence records an increase in neritic supply to the periplatform from the late Burdigalian to the early Serravallian as recorded in Sr/Ca and δ¹³C values. The increase in neritic material coincided with a stepwise intensification of the regional Oxygen Minimum Zone (OMZ) recorded by Mn/Ca ratios. During these trends, short-lived oscillations in local carbonate production and OMZ intensity were superimposed on the larger trend. The expansion of the OMZ was driven by periods of cooling while the increase in neritic production was driven by warming and sea-level rise. These results reinforce existing models of the evolution of the Kardiva Platform with respect to sea level and add to it a refined understanding of the relation to regional nutrient patterns.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMiocene epoch 3acarbonates 3acase studies 3aevolution 3ageochemistry 3ageometry 3ageophysics 3aoxygen 3apalaeogeography 3apaleoclimatology 3apaleoecology 3asea level 3atemperature 3aIndian Ocean 3aMaldives 0aCarbonate platforms 0aMiocene Climatic Optimum 0aOxygen Minimum Zone 0aIODP expedition 359 0aSite U14681 aReolid, Jesús1 aBetzler, Christian1 aEberli, Gregor P.1 aWaldmann, Nicolas D.0 tPalaeogeography, palaeoclimatology, palaeoecology.g2020 Dec. 01, v. 559 p.109969-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:2694x0031-01827nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.palaeo.2020.1099693Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02938naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002800140245012300168300001600291520186300307592002802170650001502198650001402213650002102227650002602248650002202274650000902296650001102305650001302316650001202329651001402341700002102355700002402376773009302400856007402493852000902567655001202576IND60080684320221120230711.0140802e201408  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008068432DNAL7 a10.1111/ecog.006202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGutiérrez, Eliécer E.10aCan biotic interactions cause allopatry? Niche models, competition, and distributions of South American mouse opossums  ap. 741-753.  aBased on our own empirical data and a literature review, we explore the possibility that biotic interactions, specifically competition, might be responsible for creating, and/or maintaining, geographic isolation. Ecological niche modeling was first used to test whether the distributions of 2 species of Neotropical marsupials (Marmosa robinsoni and M. xerophila) fit the predicted geographic pattern of competitive exclusion: one species predominates in areas environmentally suitable for both species along real contact zones. Secondly, we examined the connectivity among populations of each species, interpreted in the light of the niche models. The results show predominance of M. xerophila along its contact zone with M. robinsoni in the Península de Paraguaná in northwestern Venezuela. There, M. robinsoni has an extremely restricted distribution despite climatic conditions suitable for both species across the peninsula and its isthmus. The latter two results suggest that M. xerophila may be responsible for the geographic isolation of the peninsular populations of M. robinsoni with respect to other populations of the latter species in northwestern Venezuela. These results may represent an example of allopatry caused, or at least maintained, by competition. Our results and a review of numerous studies in which biotic interactions restrict species distributions (including at the continental scale) support a previously overlooked phenomenon: biotic interactions can isolate populations of a species. We propose 2 general mechanisms, intrusion and contraction, to classify allopatric conditions caused by various classes of biotic interactions. We present a necessary modification of the concept of ecological vicariance to include biotic interactions as possible vicariant agents regardless of whether genetic differentiation occurs or not.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMetatheria 3aallopatry 3aclimatic factors 3acompetitive exclusion 3agenetic variation 3amice 3amodels 3aopossums 3atropics 3aVenezuela1 aBoria, Robert A.1 aAnderson, Robert P.0 tEcography.g2014 Aug., v. 37, no. 8 p.741-753dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0906-75907nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ecog.006203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03031naa a2200661 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245011300165300001600278520110700294592002801401650002701429650002101456650002101477650001501498650002501513650002601538650003001564650002801594650002501622650002101647650002901668650001901697650001601716650001301732650001101745650001501756650001101771650001901782650001301801650002201814650004401836650001701880650001001897650003101907653001701938653001401955653001501969653000801984653001601992700001202008700001902020700002402039700001302063700002002076700001402096700001802110700001302128700001402141773011102155856008202266852000902348655001202357IND60544087020221122002445.0190415e201401  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054408702DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jff.2013.11.0222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWen, Lingrong10aIdentification of flavonoids in litchi (Litchi chinensis Sonn.) leaf and evaluation of anticancer activities  ap. 555-563.  aSix flavonoids, namely luteolin (1), epicatechin (2), kaempferol 3-O-β-glucoside (3), kaempferol 3-O-α-rhamnoside (4), procyanidin A2 (5) and rutin (6) were purified from the EtOAc-soluble extract of litchi leaf by column chromatography.

Although previous studies have suggested that the Altyn Tagh Shan and the Eastern Kunlun Range of northern Tibet have experienced differential faulting and exhumation history, our knowledge of the temporal and spatial distribution of the growth of the northwestern Tibetan Plateau is still lacking. In this study, we integrate new geologic mapping, low-temperature themochronometry (18 apatite-fission track ages), and Optically Stimulated Luminescence (OSL) dating to provide constraints on the Cenozoic cooling history of northwestern Tibet and late Quaternary fluvial terrace development. We focus on where Altyn Tagh Shan structures are juxtaposed against Eastern Kunlun Range structures. New fission-track cooling ages from one traverse along the Aksu River yielded three cooling age domains: Paleocene, Miocene, and early Pliocene. With this new knowledge of ~12–10 Ma initiation of Jianxiashan thrusting and exhumation, we suggest a refined N-S shortening rate of this thrust system of 2.0–2.4 mm/yr and strain rates of 8–9 × 10⁻¹⁶ s⁻¹. Thermal history modeling suggests that the study area experienced two broad events, including slow cooling through the AFT PAZ since the early Eocene and rapid cooling during the late Miocene. Our OSL dating results from the Aksu drainage reflect two separate processes of aggradation and incision that occurred during the late Pleistocene and Holocene, respectively, which are interpreted to result from long-term forcing of incision by a constant rate of tectonic uplift modulated by late Quaternary climatic variations. We interpret that this incision occurred at a rate of ~1 mm/yr, which is faster than exhumation rates inferred from the AFT data (0.3–0.5 mm/yr). These Quaternary exhumation rates may reflect faster recent exhumation or uplift associated with the proximal Altyn Tagh fault. In accordance with previous studies, we present a refined Cenozoic tectonic model for the evolution history of northern Tibet. The deformation pattern of northern Tibet results from clockwise rotation of preexisting weaknesses and transpressional deformation along the Kunlun fault and the Haiyuan fault.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEocene epoch 3aHolocene epoch 3aMiocene epoch 3aPaleocene epoch 3aPleistocene epoch 3aPliocene epoch 3acooling 3adeformation 3adrainage 3aevolution 3aluminescence 3amodels 3apalaeogeography 3apaleoclimatology 3apaleoecology 3arivers 3atectonics 3aChina 0aTibetan plateau 0aThermochronometry 0aOSL dating 0aApatite fission track 0aShortening rate1 aLi, Jie1 aZuza, Andrew V.1 aLiu, Changfeng1 aLiu, Wencan1 aChen, Xuanhua1 aJiang, Tian1 aLi, Bing0 tPalaeogeography, palaeoclimatology, palaeoecology.g2020 Dec. 15, v. 560 p.109971-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:2694x0031-01827nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.palaeo.2020.1099713Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04772naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001400150245014200164500001900306520296100325592002803286650001203314650002003326650002203346650001203368650001703380650001203397650001503409650001603424650002203440650001103462650002003473650002103493650001703514650001303531650001603544651001203560651001003572651000903582653000903591653003003600653002003630653003203650653001903682653002403701700003003725700001903755700002103774700002603795700001703821700001403838700001503852700001903867700001703886700001603903773013303919856008504052852000904137655001204146IND60708706820221119113521.0201118e20201215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070870682DNAL7 a10.1016/j.palaeo.2020.1099732doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Jun10aAbrupt warming in the latest Permian detected using high-resolution in situ oxygen isotopes of conodont apatite from Abadeh, central Iran  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aClimate warming, probably as a result of massive degassing of greenhouse gases from the Siberian Traps magmatism, has often been acclaimed as a major cause of the end-Permian mass extinction. Indeed, several studies have documented a sudden rise in seawater temperatures during the latest Permian-earliest Triassic, as evidenced by oxygen isotopic records measured on conodont apatite. However, whether such a rapid increase in seawater temperatures occurred before, during, or after the mass extinction remains controversial. Moreover, the pattern of this rise in seawater temperatures and its timing relative to the latest Permian-earliest Triassic carbon cycle disruption, mass extinction, as well as the Siberian Traps magmatism still need to be rigorously examined in various regions. In this study, we present high-resolution oxygen isotopic records of conodont apatite (δ¹⁸Oₐₚₐₜᵢₜₑ) from the Upper Permian-lowermost Triassic interval at the Abadeh section, central Iran that are analyzed with in situ secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) method. The δ¹⁸Oₐₚₐₜᵢₜₑ results from Abadeh demonstrate a clear pattern consisting of three phases: (1) From the lower Wuchiapingian Clarkina dukouensis Zone to the end-Permian mass extinction horizon, δ¹⁸Oₐₚₐₜᵢₜₑ values are relatively stable, fluctuating in the range of 18.28-20.15‰ with an average of 19.44‰. (2) δ¹⁸Oₐₚₐₜᵢₜₑ value remains high as 19.26‰ at the mass extinction horizon. Above this horizon, a sudden decrease occurs in the Clarkina hauschkei Zone and reaches a low value of 17.05‰ close to the Permian-Triassic boundary. (3) In the lowermost Triassic, δ¹⁸Oₐₚₐₜᵢₜₑ values maintain a low baseline in the range of 16.92-17.39‰ with an average of 17.11‰. Overall, the most dramatic change in δ¹⁸Oₐₚₐₜᵢₜₑ values (i.e., a decrease of ~2‰), converting into an abrupt warming of ~10 °C, occurred above the mass extinction horizon and below the Permian-Triassic boundary at Abadeh. The Abadeh δ¹⁸Oₐₚₐₜᵢₜₑ record is consistent with previous results documented in South China, Iran, and Armenia in terms of the timing and magnitude of a substantial warming, and therefore represents a global signature. If applying the high-precision temporal framework established in the well-dated Meishan GSSP section to Abadeh, the abrupt warming of ~10 °C took only a maximum duration of ~37 kyr (thousand years). By projecting the carbon cycle change, temperature rise, mass extinction at the Abadeh and Meishan sections, and the temporal evolution of the Siberian Traps magmatism onto a unified timescale, the temporal correlation strongly suggests that the switch from dominantly extrusive eruptions to widespread sill intrusions is probably the most annihilating phase of the Siberian Traps magmatism, and is temporally consistent with the end-Permian mass extinction.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMeishan 3aTriassic period 3aWuchiapingian age 3aapatite 3acarbon cycle 3aclimate 3aextinction 3agreenhouses 3amass spectrometry 3aoxygen 3apalaeogeography 3apaleoclimatology 3apaleoecology 3aseawater 3atemperature 3aArmenia 3aChina 3aIran 0aSIMS 0aPermian-Triassic boundary 0aClimate warming 0aEnd-Permian mass extinction 0aSiberian Traps 0aIntrusive magmatism1 aShen, S.

(PM) is an important crop for dryland rotations in the central Great Plains. The crop is traditionally swathed before combining to promote uniform drying of the panicle and to minimize seed shattering losses. Direct harvesting of PM with a stripper-header would eliminate the swathing operation resulting in cost savings, and increased standing crop residues to enhance erosion protection, snow catch, and precipitation storage efficiency. This study was conducted to determine yield differences between conventionally swathed and stripper-header harvested PM and to compare PM residue mass and orientation following the two harvest techniques. The study was conducted over four growing seasons at Akron, CO. Proso millet was harvested either by swathing and then picking up the swath with a combine, or by direct harvesting with a stripper-header attached to the combine. Seed yields and moisture contents at harvest were not significantly different between treatments. About 20% more seed was found on the ground with the stripper-header harvest than with the conventionally swathed harvest, but the increased shattering resulted in only about 1% loss of the average final yield. Using a stripper-header resulted in both the standing residue mass and the silhouette area index following harvest to be four times greater than in conventionally swathed PM. A stripper-header can be used to successfully direct harvest PM thereby reducing harvest costs and increasing surface crop residues following harvest.  aPublisher supplied data 3aharvesting 3agrain crops 3aPanicum miliaceum 3amillets 3astubble 3aarea 3adryland farming 3awater content 3aharvesters 3aseed shattering 3adesiccation (plant physiology) 3aColorado1 aNielsen, David C.1 aVigil, Merle F.1 aCalderón, Francisco J.1 aWest, Mark S.0 tAgronomy journal.g2008 May, v. 100, no. 3 p.580-584dAmerican Society of AgronomywJournal:jnl44592x0002-19627nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/185423Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2134/agronj2007.02683Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle03049naa a2200613 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004000111040001800151100001900169245014100188300001800329520109500347592002801442650001401470650001701484650001601501650002001517650001701537650001501554650001901569650002201588650001501610650002501625650003801650650003801688650001201726650002701738650002101765650001101786650002801797650002801825650002501853650007401878650002301952650002501975650003002000650003402030650002602064650004002090651001402130651001402144700001502158700001302173700001302186700001502199700001602214773009802230856008602328852000902414655001202423IND4458593820221120064142.0141110e201107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445859382DNAL7 a215462462pmid7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2011.04.0382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhou, Wenguang10aLocal bioprospecting for high-lipid producing microalgal strains to be grown on concentrated municipal wastewater for biofuel production  ap. 6909-6919.  aMass cultivation of microalgae for biofuel production depends heavily on the performance of the microalgae strains used. In this study, 60 algae-like microorganisms collected from different sampling sites in Minnesota were examined using multi-step screening and acclimation procedures to select high-lipid producing facultative heterotrophic microalgae strains capable of growing on concentrated municipal wastewater (CMW) for simultaneous energy crop production and wastewater treatment. Twenty-seven facultative heterotrophic microalgae strains were found, among which 17 strains were proved to be tolerant to CMW. These 17 top-performing strains were identified through morphological observation and DNA sequencing as Chlorella sp., Heynigia sp., Hindakia sp., Micractinium sp., and Scenedesmus sp. Five strains were chosen for other studies because of their ability to adapt to CMW, high growth rates (0.455–0.498d⁻¹) and higher lipid productivities (74.5–77.8mgL⁻¹d⁻¹). These strains are considered highly promising compared with other strains reported in the literature.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChlorella 3aMicractinium 3aScenedesmus 3acrop production 3aenergy crops 3amicroalgae 3amicroorganisms 3asequence analysis 3awastewater 3awastewater treatment 2aBiofuelsxanalysisxmicrobiology. 2aBiological Oxygen Demand Analysis 2aBiomass 2aBiotechnologyxmethods 2aCarbonxanalysis 2aCities 2aFatty Acidsxmetabolism 2aHeterotrophic Processes 2aLipidsxbiosynthesis 2aMicroalgaexgeneticsxgrowth & developmentxisolation & purification. 2aNitrogenxanalysis 2aPhosphorusxanalysis 2aPolymerase Chain Reaction 2aRNA, Ribosomal, 18Sxgenetics 2aWaste Disposal, Fluid 2aWater Purificationxinstrumentation 3aMinnesota 0aMinnesota1 aLi, Yecong1 aMin, Min1 aHu, Bing1 aChen, Paul1 aRuan, Roger0 tBioresource technology.g2011 July, v. 102, no. 13 p.6909-6919dElsevier Ltdx0960-85247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2011.04.0383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03198naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100001800188245013200206300001400338506007600352520148200428592002801910506003701938650001401975650002801989650003402017650001702051650002502068650002702093650001802120650002302138650001702161650001302178650002102191650002102212650002002233650001302253650001502266651001002281653002302291653001902314653001502333653001502348653002702363653001602390700002002406700001802426773010902444856008202553852000902635655001202644IND60544087220221207091257.0190415e201401  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054408722DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jff.2013.11.0242doi7 aPMC71855052pmcid7 a323629402pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYan, Jing-Kun10aRecent advances in Cordyceps sinensis polysaccharides: Mycelial fermentation, isolation, structure, and bioactivities: A review  ap. 33-47.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCordyceps (Ophiocordyceps sinensis) sinensis, the Chinese caterpillar fungus, is a unique and precious medicinal fungus in traditional Chinese medicine which has been used as a prestigious tonic and therapeutic herb in China for centuries. Polysaccharides are bioactive constituents of C. sinensis, exhibiting several activities such as immunomodulation, antitumour, antioxidant and hypoglycaemic. As natural C. sinensis fruiting body-caterpillar complexes are very rare and expensive, the polysaccharides documented over the last 15–20years from this fungal species were mostly extracted from cultivated fungal mycelia (intracellular polysaccharides) or from mycelial fermentation broth (exopolysaccharides). Extraction and purification of the polysaccharides is a tedious process involving numerous steps of liquid and solid phase separations. Nevertheless, a large number of polysaccharide structures have been purified and elucidated. However, relationships between the structures and activities of these polysaccharides are not well established. This review provides a comprehensive summary of the most recent developments in various aspects (i.e., production, extraction, structure, and bioactivity) of the intracellular and exopolysaccharides from mycelial fermentation of C. sinensis fungi. The contents and data will serve as useful references for further investigation, production and application of these polysaccharides in functional foods and therapeutic agents.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aCordyceps 3aOphiocordyceps sinensis 3aOriental traditional medicine 3aantioxidants 3abioactive properties 3acarbohydrate structure 3aculture media 3aexopolysaccharides 3afermentation 3afruiting 3afunctional foods 3aimmunomodulation 3amedicinal fungi 3amycelium 3aseparation 3aChina 0aCordyceps sinensis 0aPolysaccharide 0aProduction 0aExtraction 0aStructural elucidation 0aBioactivity1 aWang, Wen-Qiang1 aWu, Jian-Yong0 tJournal of functional foods.g2014 Jan., v. 6 p.33-47dElsevier LtdwJournal:J000000142x1756-46467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jff.2013.11.0243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01339naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245009100157300002000248520033700268592002800605650002300633650002300656650001000679650002600689650001600715700001400731700001800745700001600763700001500779773013600794856007400930852000901004655001201013IND60639702020221119181825.0190502e20171123xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063970202DNAL7 a10.1039/c7cc08106e2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Zekun10aAggregation-induced emission assembled ultrathin films for white light-emitting diodes  ap. 12676-12679.  aAvoiding the intractable aggregation-caused quenching in solid-state materials, two aggregation-induced emission molecules were first implemented to fabricate white-light emitting ultrathin films with boosted quantum yields via layer-by-layer assembly.

We evaluated the cost-effectiveness of the administration of maternal immunisation (MI), infant mAb (IA) and paediatric immunisation (PI) as well as their combinations in eight Chinese cities.We used a static model to estimate the impact of these preventive interventions on reducing the burden of RSV-ALRI in twelve monthly birth cohorts from a societal perspective. In addition to year-round administration, we also considered seasonal administration of MI and IA (i.e., administered only to children born in selected months). The primary outcome was threshold strategy cost (TSC), defined as the maximum costs per child for a strategy to be cost-effective.With a willingness-to-pay threshold of one national GDP per capita per QALY gained for all the cities, TSC of year-round strategies was: (i) US$2.4 (95% CI: 1.9-3.4) to US$14.7 (11.6-21.4) for MI; (ii) US$19.9 (16.9-25.9) to US$144.2 (124.6-184.7) for IA; (iii) US$28.7 (22.0-42.0) to US$201.0 (156.5-298.6) for PI; (iv) US$31.1 (24.0-45.5) to US$220.7 (172.0-327.3) for maternal plus paediatric immunisation (MPI); and (v) US$41.3 (32.6-58.9) to US$306.2 (244.1-441.3) for infant mAb plus paediatric immunisation (AP). In all cities, the top ten seasonal strategies (ranked by TSC) protected infants from 5 or fewer monthly birth cohorts.Administration of these interventions could be cost-effective if they are suitably priced. Suitably-timed seasonal administration could be more cost-effective than their year-round counterpart. Our results can inform the optimal strategy once these preventive interventions are commercially available.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRespiratory syncytial virus 3achildren 3acost effectiveness 3aimmunization 3amodels 3avaccines 3awillingness to pay 0aAcute lower respiratory infection 0aMaternal immunisation 0aMonoclonal antibody 0aPaediatric immunisation 0aCost-effectiveness1 aLeung, Kathy1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4777-388X1 aJit, Mark1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6658-82551 aWu, Joseph T.0 tVaccine.g2021 Sept. 15, v. 39, no. 39 p.5490-5498dElsevier LtdwJournal:6210x0264-410X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2021.08.0573Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02467naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100006100146245017400207300001800381500001900399520123100418592002801649650003401677650002101711650001501732650001101747650002301758650001201781700001401793700001401807700005301821700001901874773013501893856008002028852000902108655001202117IND60727372620221121174649.0210211e20210202xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072737262DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.0c112592doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Yangrunqian1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4746-236010aControllable Electrochemical Deposition and Theoretical Understanding of Conformal Perovskite on Textured Silicon towards Efficient Perovskite/Silicon Tandem Solar Cells  ap. 2875-2883.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aPerovskite (PSK)/crystalline silicon (c-Si) monolithic tandem solar cells (TSCs) are considered as a promising alternative to break the single-junction Shockley–Queisser efficiency limit. However, existing methods for preparing PSK on textured c-Si solar cells are either technically complex or expensive. Here, we report a simple and efficient two-step electrochemical deposition method for the conformal growth of nanoscale PSK on traditional pyramid-shaped textured silicon heterojunction solar cells. In combination with the simulation based on the Butler–Volmer model, we have understood the electrode dynamics of the overpotential deposition of uniform Pb on the textured silicon surface, followed by the complete conversion of the deposited Pb into conformal and nanoscale PSK. The nucleation and growth of Pb and PSK can be conveniently optimized by adjusting the bias voltage, and the entire electrochemical deposition process can be completed in a few minutes. We have further investigated theoretically the effect of the pyramid height and angle on the uniformity and thickness distribution of the Pb deposition and PSK conversion. The present work establishes an easy way for low-cost PSK/c-Si monolithic TSCs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aelectric potential difference 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3amodels 3aphysical chemistry 3asilicon1 aGao, Chao1 aWang, Xin1 aLiu, Hong1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2241-11991 aShen, Wenzhong0 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2021 Feb. 02, v. 125, no. 5 p.2875-2883dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23573x1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.0c112593Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03081naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002200140245009700162300001600259500001500275520194700290592002802237650001502265650001702280650002402297650001802321650001702339650001102356650001602367650000902383651001902392653001202411700002102423700002202444700001902466700002202485773009302507856007402600852000902674655001202683IND60080684720221120230751.0140802e201408  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008068472DNAL7 a10.1111/ecog.005352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLawson, Callum R.10aTopographic microclimates drive microhabitat associations at the range margin of a butterfly  ap. 732-740.  a2019-12-06  aThe habitat associations of individuals underpin the dynamics of species distributions. Broad‐scale gradients in climate can alter habitat associations across species’ geographic ranges, but topographic heterogeneity creates local microclimates which could generate variation in habitat use at finer spatial scales. We examined the selection of microhabitats for egg‐laying by populations of a thermally‐constrained butterfly, the skipper Hesperia comma, across 16 sites with different regional temperatures and topographic microclimates. Using models of thermal microclimate, we examined how the association between eggs and warm bare ground microhabitats varied with ambient temperature, and predicted bare ground associations in 287 existing H. comma populations, to investigate the relative impacts of regional temperatures and topographic microclimates on microhabitat use. Eggs were most strongly associated with bare ground in relatively cool sites, indicating climate‐driven changes in microhabitat use. The majority of temperature variation between study sites was attributable to topographic microclimates rather than regional temperature differences, such that changes in microhabitat associations occurred principally between north‐ and south‐facing slopes within the same region. Predicted microhabitat associations across the UK distribution of H. comma showed that, due to the large temperature differences generated by topography, most of the between‐population variation in microhabitat use occurs locally within 5 km grid squares, with a smaller proportion occurring at a regional level between 5 km squares. Our findings show how microclimatic variation generated by topography alters the habitat associations of populations at fine spatial scales, suggesting that microclimate‐driven changes in habitat suitability could shape species’ distribution dynamics and their responses to environmental change.  aPublisher supplied data 3atopography 3amicroclimate 3aambient temperature 3amicrohabitats 3abiogeography 3amodels 3abutterflies 3aeggs 3aUnited Kingdom 0aclimate1 aBennie, Jonathan1 aHodgson, Jenny A.1 aThomas, C.

Improved anion receptors  ap. 24-34.  aCalixpyrroles and related macrocycles are non-aromatic synthetic anion receptors that have attracted considerable attention in recent years. The unfunctionalized, parent calix[4]pyrrole system, also known as octamethylporphyrinogen, may be prepared in one step and in high yield from pyrrole and acetone, and is an effective anion receptor, showing a preference for fluoride, phosphate, carboxylate and chloride anions in organic media. Efforts to improve the anion binding affinity of calix[4]pyrrole and to modify its inherent selectivity have led to the synthesis of a variety of new, modified calixpyrroles. Among the most effective of these are derivatives that contain bridging “straps”. In this Feature Article, the preparation and properties of these and other topographically nonplanar calixpyrrole analogues are reviewed from the perspective of the anion recognition chemist.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetone 3aanions 3abinding capacity 3achemical reactions 3afluorides 3aphosphates 3apyrroles 3areceptors1 aMiyaji, Hidekazu1 aYoon, Dae-Wi1 aSessler, Jonathan L.0 tChemical communications.g2007 Dec. 13, , no. 1 p.24-34dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26910x1364-548X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/b713183f3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03055naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002700113040001800140100002000158245007800178300001800256520197100274592002802245650001202273650001902285650001202304650001402316650001302330650001502343650003702358650002102395650002202416650002502438700002102463700001802484773009702502856007302599852000902672655001202681IND60080685020221120230744.0140802e201408  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008068502DNAL7 a249546692pmid7 a10.1111/mec.128432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLighten, Jackie10aCritical review of NGS analyses for de novo genotyping multigene families  ap. 3957-3972.  aThe genotyping of highly polymorphic multigene families across many individuals used to be a particularly challenging task because of methodological limitations associated with traditional approaches. Next‐generation sequencing (NGS) can overcome most of these limitations, and it is increasingly being applied in population genetic studies of multigene families. Here, we critically review NGS bioinformatic approaches that have been used to genotype the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) immune genes, and we discuss how the significant advances made in this field are applicable to population genetic studies of gene families. Increasingly, approaches are introduced that apply thresholds of sequencing depth and sequence similarity to separate alleles from methodological artefacts. We explain why these approaches are particularly sensitive to methodological biases by violating fundamental genotyping assumptions. An alternative strategy that utilizes ultra‐deep sequencing (hundreds to thousands of sequences per amplicon) to reconstruct genotypes and applies statistical methods on the sequencing depth to separate alleles from artefacts appears to be more robust. Importantly, the ‘degree of change’ (DOC) method avoids using arbitrary cut‐off thresholds by looking for statistical boundaries between the sequencing depth for alleles and artefacts, and hence, it is entirely repeatable across studies. Although the advances made in generating NGS data are still far ahead of our ability to perform reliable processing, analysis and interpretation, the community is developing statistically rigorous protocols that will allow us to address novel questions in evolution, ecology and genetics of multigene families. Future developments in third‐generation single molecule sequencing may potentially help overcome problems that still persist in de novo multigene amplicon genotyping when using current second‐generation sequencing approaches.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalleles 3abioinformatics 3aecology 3aevolution 3agenotype 3agenotyping 3amajor histocompatibility complex 3amultigene family 3asequence homology 3astatistical analysis1 aOosterhout, Cock1 aBentzen, Paul0 tMolecular ecology.g2014 Aug., v. 23, no. 16 p.3957-3972dBlackwell Sciencex0962-10837nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/mec.128433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02854naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100005700153245009500210300002000305520146200325592002801787650001401815650002301829650001101852650001501863650001101878650001301889650001101902650001401913650001601927650001701943650001101960650001701971650001801988700005202006700001502058700001802073700005402091700005602145773012202201856008802323852000902411655001202420IND60756861020221120100957.0211118e20211108xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075686102DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.energyfuels.1c030232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTang, Hairong1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8935-593X10aDecomposition of N₂O on ZIF-67-Derived Co/CoOₓ@Carbon Catalysts and SO₂ Interference  ap. 18664-18679.  aZeolitic-imidazolate framework precursors (ZIF-67) were synthesized in an inorganic solution with triethylamine as a deprotonating agent for N₂O decomposition, and the catalytic activities of the pyrolysis products under different conditions were investigated. Among them, the Co/CoOₓ@carbon catalyst pyrolyzed at 650 °C in a N₂ atmosphere (Co-650N) exhibited excellent low-temperature catalytic activity and stability, achieving 50% decomposition efficiency at 305 °C and ∼100% at 400 °C, which benefitted from its large specific surface area, great reduction performance, abundant cobalt active sites, and surface oxygen species. Further, utilizing temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) and in situ diffused reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) results, it was found that N₂O molecules preferentially combined with oxygen species bound to cobalt sites. The absorbed N₂O was decomposed into N₂ and oxygen species, and the latter was subsequently transferred to carbon frameworks. Interestingly, the amorphous graphitic carbon frameworks played an important role in transferring/storing active oxygen and regenerating cobalt sites. Moreover, Co-650N exhibited better resistance to SO₂, and the efficiency could be recovered via heating and finally stabilized at 100%. Finally, the mechanisms of N₂O decomposition and sulfur poisoning-reactivation on Co/CoOₓ@carbon catalysts were proposed for the first time.  aPublisher supplied data 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3acobalt 3adesorption 3aenergy 3agraphene 3aoxygen 3apyrolysis 3areflectance 3aspectroscopy 3asulfur 3asurface area 3atriethylamine1 aHe, Yong1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7037-90071 aLiu, Peixi1 aShao, Jiaming1 aLin, Fawei1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5461-82771 aWang, Zhihua1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7521-29000 tEnergy & fuels.g2021 Nov. 08, v. 35, no. 22 p.18664-18679dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23338x1520-50297nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.energyfuels.1c030233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02544naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245012400167300001300291520085000304592002801154650002201182650001401204650001201218650001801230650001501248650002401263650001001287650001901297650002601316650001501342650002301357653000801380653002401388653002001412653002401432653000801456653001001464700002701474700001901501700002501520700001901545700002201564700002401586700001601610700002101626700002201647700002001669700001801689700001601707700002201723700001901745773009601764856008501860852000901945655001201954IND60557036020221119142625.0170105e20161210xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055703602DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jconrel.2016.09.0192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Tengfei10aCamelid single-domain antibodies: A versatile tool for in vivo imaging of extracellular and intracellular brain targets  ap. 1-10.  aDetection of intracerebral targets with imaging probes is challenging due to the non-permissive nature of blood-brain barrier (BBB). The present work describes two novel single-domain antibodies (VHHs or nanobodies) that specifically recognize extracellular amyloid deposits and intracellular tau neurofibrillary tangles, the two core lesions of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Following intravenous administration in transgenic mouse models of AD, in vivo real-time two-photon microscopy showed gradual extravasation of the VHHs across the BBB, diffusion in the parenchyma and labeling of amyloid deposits and neurofibrillary tangles. Our results demonstrate that VHHs can be used as specific BBB-permeable probes for both extracellular and intracellular brain targets and suggest new avenues for therapeutic and diagnostic applications in neurology.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAlzheimer disease 3aCamelidae 3aamyloid 3aanimal models 3aantibodies 3ablood-brain barrier 3abrain 3aimage analysis 3aintravenous injection 3amicroscopy 3atransgenic animals 0aVHH 0aBlood-brain barrier 0aIn vivo imaging 0aAlzheimer's disease 0aTau 0aAbeta1 aVandesquille, Matthias1 aKoukouli, Fani1 aDudeffant, Clémence1 aYoussef, Ihsen1 aLenormand, Pascal1 aGanneau, Christelle1 aMaskos, Uwe1 aCzech, Christian1 aGrueninger, Fiona1 aDuyckaerts, C.,1 aDhenain, Marc1 aBay, Sylvie1 aDelatour, Benoît1 aLafaye, Pierre0 tJournal of Controlled Release.g2016 Dec. 10, v. 243 p.1-10dElsevier B.V.x0168-36597nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jconrel.2016.09.0193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02712naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094024002200130024001900152040001800171100002900189245009400218300001800312506007600330520126100406592002801667506003701695650001901732650002301751650002301774650001001797650002101807650001801828650002101846650001301867700002001880700001901900700002901919700002801948700002201976700001601998700001902014700002002033773010802053856008402161852000902245655001202254IND60550629920221207073308.0160912e20160912xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055062992DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.biomac.6b005082doi7 aPMC50220662pmcid7 a273878202pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCollins, Christopher J.,10aInfluence of Molecular Structure on the In Vivo Performance of Flexible Rod Polyrotaxanes  ap. 2777-2786.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aPolyrotaxanes, a family of rod-shaped nanomaterials comprised of noncovalent polymer/macrocycle assemblies, are being used in a growing number of materials and biomedical applications. Their physiochemical properties can vary widely as a function of composition, potentially leading to different in vivo performance outcomes. We sought to characterize the pharmacokinetic profiles, toxicities, and protein corona compositions of 2-hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin polyrotaxanes as a function of variations in macrocycle threading efficiency, molecular weight, and triblock copolymer core structure. We show that polyrotaxane fate in vivo is governed by the structure and dynamics of their rodlike morphologies, such that highly threaded polyrotaxanes are long circulating and deposit in the liver, whereas lung deposition and rapid clearance is observed for species bearing lower 2-hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin threading percentages. Architecture differences also promote recruitment of different serum protein classes and proportions; however, physiochemical differences have little or no influence on their toxicity. These findings provide important structural insights for guiding the development of polyrotaxanes as scaffolds for biomedical applications.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3ablood proteins 3achemical structure 3acomposite polymers 3aliver 3amolecular weight 3ananomaterials 3apharmacokinetics 3atoxicity1 aMondjinou, Yawo1 aLoren, Bradley1 aTorregrosa-Allen, Sandra1 aSimmons, Christopher J.1 aElzey, Bennett

Herein, a new cathode material for rechargeable Ni/Zn batteries is introduced based on various compositions of mixed metal oxide (MMO) through a calcination process of nickel–vanadium layered double hydroxide at different temperatures. The results demonstrated that the prepared sample at 500 °C presents the best electrochemical properties such as a good electrochemical discharge capacity (278.4 mAh g–¹ at 0.5 A g–¹), good cycle life (capacity retention of 74% after 1000 cycles at 5 A g–¹), and excellent rate capability (177 mAh g–¹ at 5 A g–¹). These improvements can be related to the designed compositions of bimetallic oxides, NiO and Ni₃V₂O₈, the amorphous phase, good morphology, and high structural stability, which lead to enhanced OH– guest ion diffusion in the structure and an increase in the active surface area for electrochemical reactions. It is expected that the introduced novel MMO compound is a promising new effective cathode electrode in rechargeable Ni/Zn batteries for many types of applications toward reliable and safe energy storage devices.  aPublisher supplied data 3acathodes 3aelectrochemistry 3aenergy 3ananosheets 3anickel oxide 3asurface area1 aEsfandiar, Ali1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7566-97911 aIraji zad, Azam1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6537-09910 tEnergy & fuels.g2021 Nov. 08, v. 35, no. 22 p.18805-18814dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23338x1520-50297nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.energyfuels.1c031043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02170naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100005700140245008100197500001100278520107300289592002801362596007601390650001701466650001101483650001301494650001901507650001501526700005701541700001901598700002301617773012101640856007401761852000901835655001201844IND60647180120221116163122.0190617e201905  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064718012DNAL7 a10.1111/conl.126322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSacre, Edmond1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2218-431X14aThe context dependence of frontier versus wilderness conservation priorities  aLETTER  aMuch of conservation planning has focused on how we should prioritize areas for protection based on biodiversity and cost, but less is known about how we should prioritize areas based upon the level of threat they face. We discuss two opposing threat prioritization strategies: frontier conservation (prioritizing high‐threat areas) and wilderness conservation (prioritizing low‐threat areas). Using a temporally explicit model, we demonstrate that the best strategy depends on a variety of factors, including protection costs, heterogeneity in biodiversity, biodiversity–area relationships, the rate of biodiversity recovery, the rate of change in threats through time, and the timeframe within which we measure conservation outcomes. By quantitatively comparing the impact of these strategies, we aim to shift the debate away from a simple dichotomy of frontier versus wilderness, toward an understanding of the context‐specific benefits of each option, and a discussion of how threat combines with other factors to determine spatial conservation priorities.  aPublisher supplied data  cAustralian Research Council Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies 3abiodiversity 3amodels 3aplanning 3aprioritization 3awilderness1 aBode, Michael1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5886-44211 aWeeks, Rebecca1 aPressey, Robert L.0 tConservation letters.g2019 May, v. 12, no. 3 p.e12632-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:J000000138x1755-263X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/conl.126323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01574naa a2200229 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100002100112245004500133300001800178520092200196592002801118650001101146650001101157650001101168650001701179773012701196852000901323655001201332IND60300622420221119134703.0150703e20120622xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6030062242DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKerr, Richard A.10aHang On!

If Curiosity crashes as it dangles by cables from its flying platform festooned with blazing rockets, some scientists will see a decade or more of their careers crash with it. But there's even more riding on Curiosity's safe touchdown on 5 August. Not only will NASA have to slow the most massive load ever delivered to another planet's surface from hypervelocity bullet speeds to a dead stop, all in the usual "7 minutes of terror." But NASA is also attempting to deliver Curiosity to the surface of Mars more precisely than any mission before, within a 20-kilometer-long ellipse some 240 million kilometers from Earth. Both feats are essential to NASA's long-term goals at Mars: returning samples of martian rock and sending humans to the Red Planet.  aPublisher supplied data 3adesign 3aflight 3ahumans 3aspace flight0 tScience.g2012 June 22, v. 336, no. 6088 p.1498-1499dAmerican Association for the Advancement of Sciencex0036-80757nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle02653naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002700113040001800140100002300158245009400181300001800275520154300293592002801836650002301864650001201887650001401899650002401913650001401937650001301951650002701964650000901991650001102000650001302011700002402024700002202048700001802070773009702088856007302185852000902258655001202267IND60080685320221120230810.0140802e201408  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008068532DNAL7 a247248612pmid7 a10.1111/mec.127502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFlaxman, Samuel M.10aTheoretical models of the influence of genomic architecture on the dynamics of speciation  ap. 4074-4088.  aA long‐standing problem in evolutionary biology has been determining whether and how gradual, incremental changes at the gene level can account for rapid speciation and bursts of adaptive radiation. Using genome‐scale computer simulations, we extend previous theory showing how gradual adaptive change can generate nonlinear population transitions, resulting in the rapid formation of new, reproductively isolated species. We show that these transitions occur via a mechanism rooted in a basic property of biological heredity: the organization of genes in genomes. Genomic organization of genes facilitates two processes: (i) the build‐up of statistical associations among large numbers of genes and (ii) the action of divergent selection on persistent combinations of alleles. When a population has accumulated a critical amount of standing, divergently selected variation, the combination of these two processes allows many mutations of small effect to act synergistically and precipitously split one population into two discontinuous, reproductively isolated groups. Periods of allopatry, chromosomal linkage among loci, and large‐effect alleles can facilitate this process under some conditions, but are not required for it. Our results complement and extend existing theory on alternative stable states during population divergence, distinct phases of speciation and the rapid emergence of multilocus barriers to gene flow. The results are thus a step towards aligning population genomic theory with modern empirical studies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadaptive radiation 3aalleles 3aallopatry 3acomputer simulation 3agene flow 3agenomics 3ainheritance (genetics) 3aloci 3amodels 3amutation1 aWacholder, Aaron C.1 aFeder, Jeffrey L.1 aNosil, Patrik0 tMolecular ecology.g2014 Aug., v. 23, no. 16 p.4074-4088dBlackwell Sciencex0962-10837nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/mec.127503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01669naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245013000158300002000288520040100308592002800709650001200737650002300749650002300772650003500795650001500830650001400845650000900859650001300868700001700881700001400898700001500912700001400927700001800941700001600959700001700975700001700992700001801009773013701027856007401164852000901238655001201247IND60639702720221119181754.0190502e20171214xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063970272DNAL7 a10.1039/c7cc08180d2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Daoyuan10aDissociation of haemolytic and oligomer-preventing activities of gramicidin S derivatives targeting the amyloid-β N-terminus  ap. 13340-13343.  aThe intrinsic haemolysis of an amyloid-β (Aβ) N-terminal targeting gramicidin S derivative was successfully dissociated from its Aβ oligomer-preventing activities via Ala-scanning-based regulation of molecular amphiphilicity.

On average, dog breeds currently retain approximately 87% of the available domestic canine genetic diversity. Requirements that breeding stock must be ‘clear’ for all genetic disorders may firstly place undue genetic pressure on animals tested as being ‘clear’ of known genetic disorders, secondly may contribute to loss of diversity and thirdly may result in the dissemination of new recessive disorders for which no genetic tests are available. Global exchange of genetic material may hasten the loss of alleles and this practice should be discussed in relation to the current effective population size of a breed and its expected future popularity. Genomic data do not always support the results from pedigree analysis and possible reasons for this are discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aalleles 3abreeding stock 3adog breeds 3adogs 3agenetic disorders 3agenetic variation 3ainbreeding 3apedigree 3apopulation size0 tveterinary journal.g2011 Aug., v. 189, no. 2 p.183-188dElsevier Ltdx1090-02337nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tvjl.2011.06.0173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03431naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002700151245017000178300001600348520164400364592002802008650001002036650002602046650001502072650002602087650002602113650001102139650001002150650002502160650001002185650001102195650001102206650003002217650001302247650001402260650001502274650003002289650001402319650001502333651001002348653001402358653001502372653001702387653002002404653002902424653000902453653000902462700002802471700002502499700002202524700001602546700001902562700002202581700002202603773009802625856008502723852000902808655001202817IND60132231520221118075113.0150505e20150403xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013223152DNAL7 a10.1080/01652176.2015.10234042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNavarro-Gonzalez, Nora10aEscherichia coli O157:H7 in wild boars (Sus scrofa) and Iberian ibex (Capra pyrenaica) sharing pastures with free-ranging livestock in a natural environment in Spain  ap. 102-106.  aBackground: Wild ungulates have greatly increased in abundance and range throughout Europe. This new situation presents a concern for public health because many wild ungulates are known reservoirs of zoonotic pathogens. Objectives: In this work, we tested for the presence of the zoonotic pathogen Escherichia coli O157:H7 in free-ranging livestock and sympatric wild boars (Sus scrofa) and Iberian ibex (Capra pyrenaica) in NE Spain from 2009 to 2011. In addition, antimicrobial resistance and virulence factors were assessed. Animals and methods: In total, individual fecal samples were obtained from 117 hunter-harvested wild boars and 160 Iberian ibexes. Fifty-five samples were obtained from cattle (5 herds, 380 animals in total) and four from the only horse herd in the Natural Park ‘Ports de Tortosa i Beseit’ (32 animals). Fecal samples were processed according to the ISO 16.654:2001 protocol to obtain E. coli O157 based on immunomagnetic separation. In addition, a multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) targeting nine virulence factors characteristic of human pathotypes was performed. The prevalence was compared between host species with Fisher's exact test. Results: Four wild boars (3.41%, 95% CI = 0.94–8.52) and two Iberian ibexes (1.25%, 95% CI = 0.15–4.4) carried E. coli O157:H7, which was not found in livestock feces (n = 59, 95% CI = 0–8.94). All E. coli O157:H7 isolates were susceptible to all antimicrobial agents tested. Conclusions: These results indicate that when prevalence in co-habiting livestock is low, wild ungulates do not seem to play an important role as reservoirs of E. coli O157:H7.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCapra 3aEscherichia coli O157 3aSus scrofa 3aanti-infective agents 3aantibiotic resistance 3acattle 3afeces 3afree range husbandry 3aherds 3ahorses 3ahumans 3aimmunomagnetic separation 3apastures 3apathogens 3apathotypes 3apolymerase chain reaction 3avirulence 3awild boars 3aSpain 0awild boar 0aSus scrofa 0aIberian ibex 0aCapra pyrenaica 0aantimicrobial resistance 0aSTEC 0aVTEC1 aPorrero, M.

We report on corn (Zea mays L.), soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.], and wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) yields at the USDA-ARS Beltsville Farming Systems Project (FSP), a long-term cropping systems trial established in Maryland in 1996 to evaluate the sustainability of organic and conventional grain crop production. The five FSP cropping systems include a conventional no-till corn–soybean–wheat/soybean rotation (NT), a conventional chisel-till corn–soybean–wheat/soybean rotation (CT), a 2-yr organic corn–soybean rotation (Org2), a 3-yr organic corn–soybean–wheat rotation (Org3), and a 4- to 6-yr organic corn–soybean–wheat–hay rotation (Org4+). Average corn grain yield during 9 yr was similar in NT and CT (7.88 and 8.03 Mg ha⁻¹, respectively) but yields in Org2, Org3, and Org4+ were, respectively, 41, 31, and 24% less than in CT. Low N availability explained, on average, 73% of yield losses in organic systems relative to CT while weed competition and plant population explained, on average, 23 and 4%, respectively, of these yield losses. The positive relationship between crop rotation length and corn yield among organic systems was related to increasing N availability and decreasing weed abundance with increasing rotation length. Soybean yield averaged 19% lower in the three organic systems (2.88 Mg ha⁻¹) than in the conventional systems (3.57 Mg ha⁻¹) and weed competition alone accounted for this difference. There were no consistent differences in wheat yield among cropping systems. Crop rotation length and complexity had little impact on soybean and wheat yields among organic systems. Results indicate that supplying adequate N for corn and controlling weeds in both corn and soybean are the biggest challenges to achieving equivalent yields between organic and conventional cropping systems.  aPublisher supplied data 3ano-tillage 3awheat 3aplant density 3asustainable agriculture 3along term experiments 3ahay 3aTriticum aestivum 3agrain yield 3aorganic production 3aZea mays 3aGlycine max 3acorn 3aweeds 3acrop rotation 3anitrogen 3anutrient availability 3achiseling 3asoybeans 3aMaryland1 aTeasdale, John R.1 aConklin, Anne E.0 tAgronomy journal.g2008 May, v. 100, no. 3 p.785-794dAmerican Society of AgronomywJournal:jnl44592x0002-19627nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/185453Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2134/agronj2006.03733Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle02947naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245010200158300001600260500002000276520181600296592002802112596006002140650003002200650002002230650001802250650001702268650002202285700002902307700005802336773014302394856007502537852000902612655001202621IND60788393120221122165413.0220813e202106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078839312DNAL7 a10.1002/nafm.105702doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLusk, Sean C.10aEvaluating the Performance of Methods Used to Estimate Growth Parameters from Subsampled Age Data  ap. 570-584.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aDue to time and resource limitations, the growth of many fish species is evaluated with age and length data in a length‐stratified subsample of a sample from a population. Some fisheries professionals draw inferences about growth using age and length data from only those fish that were actually aged (aged‐only method). Alternatively, growth may be evaluated by employing a method of incorporating the length‐stratified aged subsample with information from the entire sample of fish collected, such as the weighted‐mean and assigned‐age methods, which are commonly used in inland fisheries management. More recently, two prominent alternatives to those methods have emerged: the reweighting and empirical proportion methods. In this study, we used observed data from three freshwater fish species with different life history traits (short‐ to long‐lived) to inform a simulation model comparing estimated von Bertalanffy growth model parameters and predicted mean lengths at age calculated using the five aforementioned methods across a range of sample sizes per length‐group and a range of CVs. As expected, our results demonstrated that the aged‐only method is unreliable and biased when estimating von Bertalanffy parameters and mean lengths at age. The weighted‐mean method performed better than the aged‐only method but was not among the top‐performing methods. The assigned‐age, reweighting, and empirical proportion methods all performed well and produced similar estimates, although the empirical proportion method generally resulted in slightly more precise and less biased estimates. We recommend that fisheries professionals discontinue their use of the aged‐only and weighted‐mean methods and instead use the assigned‐age, reweighting, or empirical proportion method.  aPublisher supplied data  aAGFC Grant F‐42cFederal Aid in Sportfish Restoration 3aadministrative management 3afreshwater fish 3agrowth models 3alife history 3asimulation models1 aMiddaugh, Christopher R.1 aOgle, Derek H.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0370-92990 tNorth American journal of fisheries management.g2021 June, v. 41, no. 3 p.570-584dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:19701x0275-59477nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/nafm.105703Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03858naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245011600172300001600288500001900304520214200323536029902465592002802764650003202792650001502824650001402839650001802853650001702871650001802888650001102906650003302917650000902950650001602959650001402975650002102989653001503010653002003025653001503045653003703060653002903097653001503126700001603141700002203157773010303179856008503282852000903367655001203376IND60727373420221121174741.0210211e20210102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072737342DNAL7 a10.1080/00275514.2020.18134732doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aArifin, Arild R.10aNew species of Tulasnella associated with Australian terrestrial orchids in the Cryptostylidinae and Drakaeinae  ap. 212-230.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aMany orchids have an obligate relationship with Tulasnella mycorrhizal fungi for seed germination and support into adulthood. Despite the importance of Tulasnella as mycorrhizal partners, many species remain undescribed. Here, we use multiple sequence locus phylogenetic analyses to delimit and describe six new Tulasnella species associated with Australian terrestrial orchids from the subtribes Cryptostylidinae and Drakaeinae. Five of the new species, Tulasnella australiensis, T. occidentalis, T. punctata, T. densa, and T. concentrica, all associate with Cryptostylis (Cryptostylidinae), whereas T. rosea associates with Spiculaea ciliata (Drakaeinae). Isolates representing T. australiensis were previously also reported in association with Arthrochilus (Drakaeinae). All newly described Tulasnella species were delimited by phylogenetic analyses of four loci (nuc rDNA internal transcribed spacer region ITS1-5.8S-ITS2 [ITS], C14436 [ATP synthase], C4102 [glutamate synthase], and mt 16S rDNA [mtLSU]). The pairwise sequence divergence between species for the ITS region ranged from 5.6% to 25.2%, and the maximum sequence divergence within the newly described species ranged from 1.64% to 4.97%. There was a gap in the distribution of within- and between-species pairwise divergences in the region of 4–6%, with only one within-species value of 4.97% (for two T. australiensis isolates) and one between-species value of 5.6% (involving an isolate of T. occidentalis) falling within this region. Based on fluorescence staining, all six new Tulasnella species are binucleate and have septate, cylindrical hyphae. There was some subtle variation in culture morphology, but colony diameter as measured on 3MN+vitamin medium after 6 wk of growth did not differ among species. However, T. australiensis grew significantly (P < 0.02) slower than others on ½ FIM and ¼ potato dextrose agar (PDA) media. Formal description of these Tulasnella species contributes significantly to documentation of Tulasnella diversity and provides names and delimitations to underpin further research on the fungi and their relationships with orchids.  aWe would like to thank Australia Awards Scholarship from Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT) for providing scholarship to Arild Arifin (2017–2018) and Australian Orchid Foundation grants to Alyssa Weinstein (319-2017) and Arild Arifin (324-2017) for partially funding the research.  aPublisher supplied data 3aH-transporting ATP synthase 3aTulasnella 3aadulthood 3aculture media 3afluorescence 3aglutamic acid 3ahyphae 3ainternal transcribed spacers 3aloci 3anew species 3aphylogeny 3aseed germination 0aBinucleate 0acolony diameter 0amorphology 0amultilocus phylogenetic analyses 0aorchid mycorrhizal fungi 0a6 new taxa1 aMay, Tom W.1 aLinde, Celeste C.0 tMycologia.g2021 Jan. 02, v. 113, no. 1 p.212-230dTaylor & FranciswJournal:1951x1557-25367nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00275514.2020.18134733Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03753naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100005300155245015600208520200700364592002802371650001602399650002002415650002402435650001502459650002202474650002702496650001602523650001502539650002402554650001302578650002402591650001902615650001502634650001402649650000902663650002402672650001602696653002102712653002402733653003602757653002302793653002402816700002002840700005602860700001302916700001302929700001602942700001502958700001502973700001702988700001403005773009103019856005603110852000903166655001203175IND60793036520221117005426.0220914e202212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079303652DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2022.1363152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhou, Bin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2909-876410aEffects of fertilizer application on phthalate ester pollution and the soil microbial community in plastic-shed soil on long-term fertilizer experiment  aDue to the use of agricultural film, the pollution of phthalate esters (PAEs) in plastic-shed soils has attracted increasing attention. In this study, we used watermelon as a planting system and investigated the effects of organic fertilizer and chemical fertilizer application on the degradation of PAEs by evaluating soil nutrients and soil bacterial communities in plastic-shed soil. The dibutyl phthalate (DBP) concentration in the organic fertilizer soil was only 58.2% in the zero-fertilization control (CK) soil, but the concentrations of monohexyl phthalate (MEHP) and mono-n-butyl ester (MBP), the metabolites of PAEs, were found to be higher. The concentration of MBP is ten times that of DBP. The results showed that fertilization, especially the application of organic fertilizers, had a significant effect on the degradation of PAEs. There were specific biomarkers in different fertilization treatments. Among the microbiome community, Planifilum had the highest relative abundance in the organic fertilizer (OF) soil, and the highest proportion of Thermodesulfovibrionia was detected in the chemical fertilizer (CF) soil. These biomarkers were significantly correlated with PAEs and their metabolites. The relative abundance of Thermomonosporaceae was significantly positively correlated with DBP. Planifilum and Thermaerobacter, which significantly increased in organic fertilizer soil, showed a significant negative correlation with DBP and a significant positive correlation with MBP. The relative abundances of Planifilum and Geobacillus were elevated in the OF soil and may be able to co-metabolize soil nitrogen and PAEs. PAEs and their metabolites in soils had significant effects on soil microbes, as did the soil nutrients including available phosphorus (AP), alkali-hydrolysable nitrogen (Alkali-N), and organic matter (OM). Our research provides scientific support for the use of fertilizers to reduce PAE contamination but also warns of the potential risks of PAE metabolites.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGeobacillus 3aThermaerobacter 3aThermomonosporaceae 3abiomarkers 3adibutyl phthalate 3afertilizer application 3ametabolites 3amicrobiome 3amineral fertilizers 3anitrogen 3aorganic fertilizers 3aorganic matter 3aphosphorus 3apollution 3asoil 3asoil microorganisms 3awatermelons 0aPhthalate esters 0aMicrobial community 0aLong-term fertilizer experiment 0aOrganic fertilizer 0aPollution reduction1 aZheng, Xianqing1 aZhu, Zhengyi1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9852-61441 aQin, Qin1 aSong, Ke1 aSun, Lijuan1 aSun, Yafei1 aZhang, Yue1 aLv, Weiguang1 aXue, Yong0 tChemosphere.g2022 Dec., v. 308 p.136315-dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2022.136315  aDNAL 7aarticle02039naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002100140245014200161500001100303520093400314592002801248596004501276650001701321650002301338650002401361650001301385650002201398651001501420700001801435700002501453700001901478773012101497856007401618852000901692655001201701IND60647180420221116163009.0190617e201905  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064718042DNAL7 a10.1111/conl.126292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSonter, Laura J.10aQuantifying habitat losses and gains made by U.S. Species Conservation Banks to improve compensation policies and avoid perverse outcomes  aLETTER  aCompensation policies seek to counterbalance biodiversity losses caused by development; however, their effectiveness is rarely tested. We examined U.S. Species Conservation Banks (SCBs) in California, a compensation program initiated 30 years ago. We quantified the effect of 59 SCBs (15,350 ha) on habitat extent using statistical matching methods. SCBs averted a small, yet significant, amount of habitat loss (62 ha) between 2001 and 2011. However, unexpectedly, SCBs also averted significant habitat gains (1,424 ha). It is not possible to determine if losses averted by SCBs equaled losses caused by development for which credits were sold (because records of the latter do not exist), but estimated averted gains were 35 times greater than averted losses. To improve practice, SCBs must be designed to achieve outcomes that are additional and avoid crowding out other programs incentivizing statewide conservation goals.  aPublisher supplied data  aDE170100684cAustralian Research Council 3abiodiversity 3aconservation banks 3ahabitat destruction 3ahabitats 3aissues and policy 3aCalifornia1 aBarnes, Megan1 aMatthews, Jeffrey W.1 aMaron, Martine0 tConservation letters.g2019 May, v. 12, no. 3 p.e12629-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:J000000138x1755-263X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/conl.126293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02587naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100005800153245012200211300002000333520154000353592002801893650002001921650001101941650001301952650001401965650001001979650001301989700006402002773012202066856008802188852000902276655001202285IND60756861620221122040433.0211118e20211108xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075686162DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.energyfuels.1c032552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBizhani, Majid1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7181-217510aPore Characterization of Organic-Rich Shales through Application of Topological Data Analysis and Persistent Homology  ap. 18563-18573.  aThis paper discusses pore characterization of organic-rich shales using 3D high-resolution imaging and a topological data analysis (TDA) framework. In particular, our focus is on persistent homology. Our data set contains four organic-rich shale samples (imaged at 10 nm³/voxel) and a Bentheimer sandstone as the anchor point for comparison. The analysis shows that pores larger than 12.4 nm have poor connectivity, and there is no evidence of a percolating path through any of the shale samples. In contrast, the Bentheimer sandstone shows remarkable differences from the shales in terms of pore connectivity. In terms of geometry, pores and grains in shale are shown to be highly nonconvex, while sandstone exhibits a more uniform and convex distribution of pore and grain size. Euler characteristics of the samples are also computed and discussed along with the pore network extracted on the segmented images. The results show all three methods have an agreement in the overall description of the pore space. However, persistent homology data reveal more information on the pore and grain phase as compared to the other methods. In the last section of the paper, we present an investigation of topological changes in the pore space as a function of pore radius. The analysis indicates most pores must be enlarged by ∼70–80 nm for the pore space to span into a connected network. The implication is that flow mainly occurs through independent channels in shales, as opposed to sandstone where many redundant flow pathways exist.  aPublisher supplied data 3adata collection 3aenergy 3ageometry 3asandstone 3ashale 3atopology1 aHaeri Ardakani, Omid1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8740-46540 tEnergy & fuels.g2021 Nov. 08, v. 35, no. 22 p.18563-18573dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23338x1520-50297nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.energyfuels.1c032553Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03741naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245014500165300001500310520211000325592002802435650002302463650001202486650000902498650001302507650002202520650002502542650002702567650002302594650001202617650001102629650002202640650001402662650001202676650001102688650001802699650001402717650002102731650001202752650001102764650001602775650002102791650001802812650001102830653001702841653001102858653001602869653001602885653003702901700002102938773012402959856008303083852000903166655001203175IND50071205320221119072800.0190318e20131201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007120532DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agee.2013.09.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAnda, Markus10aAssessing soil properties and tidal behaviors as a strategy to avoid environmental degradation in developing new paddy fields in tidal areas  ap. 90-100.  aFluviomarine areas are promising for development of new paddy fields if fragile soil properties, natural water logging and tidal behaviors receive strategic management to avoid environmental degradation. Three transects were established to investigate the complexity of sediment and tidal attributes. Soils were sampled from each horizon of profiles and key mineralogical and chemical properties analyzed. An upper fluvial derived zone was characterized by exchangeable Ca as the dominant cation (decreasing concentration with depth) and pyrite was absent. A lower zone derived from marine sediment was dominated by exchangeable Mg (increasing concentration with depth) accompanied by pyrite. The dominance and distribution of Ca and Mg indicate the origin of sediment in tidal areas. These acid sulfate soils have limited nutrient reserves being dominated by quartz in the sand fraction. The clay was dominated by kaolinite and illite and a variable proportion of vermiculite, resulting in variation of CEC values, being high with vermiculite. Pyrite position from soil surface varied from 25 to 100cm (mostly 50–60cm) depending on thickness of fluvial zone and local slope morphology. Significant variations in tidal amplitudes led to the separation of fluviomarine areas into neap-spring tide zone (NSZ), spring tide zone (SZ) and non-flooding tide zone (NZ). Zoning allowed the selection of the SZ with low tidal amplitude and NZ as being suitable for new paddy field development. A potential drop of soil pH from 5 to 2 may occur with serious consequences for paddy field and watercourses (huge acidity and dissolved metals at toxic levels) if pyrite is exposed to oxidation conditions (e.g. drainage system lowering water level below pyrite position). Water management through “controlled drainage” should be applied to avoid pyrite oxidation, soil degradation and poor water quality. This includes dimension (depth and width) of drainage canals and maintaining water levels above the pyrite zone through control using floodgates thereby ensuring pyrite zone remains under reducing conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacid sulfate soils 3aacidity 3aclay 3adrainage 3adrainage channels 3aexchangeable calcium 3aexchangeable magnesium 3aflooded conditions 3alogging 3ametals 3anutrient reserves 3aoxidation 3apaddies 3aquartz 3asand fraction 3asediments 3asoil degradation 3asoil pH 3aspring 3avermiculite 3awater management 3awater quality 3azoning 0aSulfate soil 0aPyrite 0aTidal zones 0aPaddy field 0aEnvironment and water management1 aSubardja, Djadja0 tAgriculture, ecosystems & environment.g2013 Dec. 01, v. 181 p.90-100dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl34709x0167-88097nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agee.2013.09.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02656naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001600140245009400156300001800250500002000268520112000288592002801408596005801436596005901494596005901553596005701612596005701669650001901726650002301745650002301768650001801791650001001809650001301819650001101832650001001843650002001853650002301873700001301896700001601909700001401925700005701939773011801996856007502114852000902189655001202198IND60789279820221116142402.0220819e202208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078927982DNAL7 a10.1111/febs.164032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Ruimin10aFOXD3 and GAB2 as a pair of rivals antagonistically control hepatocellular carcinogenesis  ap. 4536-4548.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aOur previous study demonstrated that GAB2 promoted tumorigenesis in liver tissue and was a potential target for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Here, we identified that the tumour suppressor protein Forkhead box D3 (Foxd3) is a transcriptional repressor of the Gab2 gene. In human HCC cells, FOXD3 expression is low, but GAB2 expression is abundant. Increased Foxd3 expression inhibited the expression of Gab2 in a dose‐dependent manner. Ectopic expression of Foxd3 in HCC cells reduced Gab2‐mediated promotion of cell proliferation and migration in vitro. Foxd3 also inhibited Gab2‐stimulated phosphorylation of Jak2 and Stat3. Furthermore, the protein levels of Foxd3 and Gab2 had a clear negative correlation: Gab2 expression was induced, whereas Foxd3 expression was suppressed in most tumour tissues in mice with diethylnitrosamine (DEN)‐induced hepatocellular carcinoma. These results suggest that the tumour suppressor Foxd3 and tumour enhancer Gab2 mutually inhibit each other to synergistically control the occurrence of HCC, providing a novel mechanism for treating this disease.  aPublisher supplied data  a2018YFC1003701cthe National Key R&D Program of China  a31671564cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a31970797cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a2017YFC1001402che National Key R&D Program of China  a2018YFC1003701che National Key R&D Program of China 3acarcinogenesis 3acell proliferation 3adiethylnitrosamine 3adose response 3agenes 3ahepatoma 3ahumans 3aliver 3aphosphorylation 3arepressor proteins1 aSun, Yan1 aChen, Shuai1 aHong, Yun1 aLu, Zhongxian1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1682-71470 tFEBS journal.g2022 Aug., v. 289, no. 15 p.4536-4548dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3943524x1742-464X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/febs.164033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02755naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001200152245009500164500001900259520126700278592002801545650002101573650001701594650001601611650001701627650001701644650001701661650001901678650000701697650002201704650002401726653002201750653001401772653002501786653001801811653002601829700001801855700005401873700001901927700001901946700001901965700001501984700001701999700001502016700001702031773010602048856008602154852000902240655001202249IND60697072520221118052631.0200601e20200101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069707252DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfb.2019.1105902doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Li10aPEGylated MoS2 quantum dots for traceable and pH-responsive chemotherapeutic drug delivery  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aSince low pH value is widely observed in most of solid tumors, pH-responsive drug delivery system (DDS) can provide a general strategy for tumor-targeting therapy. In this work, a traceable and pH-responsive DDS (MoS₂-PEG-DOX) based on MoS₂ quantum dots (MoS₂ QDs) is successfully developed by covalently grafting MoS₂ QDs with diamine-terminated oligomeric polyethylene glycol (PEG) and then loading with a fluorescent antineoplastic anthracycline drug, doxorubicin (DOX). The functionalization of MoS₂ QDs with PEG imparts the nanocomposite with strong blue photoluminescence, low cytotoxicity, and excellent physiological stability. The MoS₂-PEG-DOX nano-assembly can be effectively taken up by U251 cells, and an accelerated DOX release is then triggered by intracellular acid condition, which in turn diminishing unwanted side effects derived by the incorporation of DOX into healthy cells. Meanwhile, the cellular uptake of the MoS₂-PEG-DOX nano-assembly, consequent DOX release and the localization of nanocarrier can be real-time monitored due to the inherent stable fluorescence of MoS₂-PEG and DOX. These findings demonstrate that MoS₂-PEG-DOX will be promising for high treatment efficacy with minimal side effects in future therapy.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical bonding 3acytotoxicity 3adoxorubicin 3adrug therapy 3afluorescence 3ananocarriers 3ananocomposites 3apH 3aphotoluminescence 3apolyethylene glycol 0aMoS2 quantum dots 0aPEGylated 0aFluorescence imaging 0aDrug delivery 0apH-Responsive release1 aJiang, Hongli1 aDong, Jian1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9941-10151 aZhang, Wenxian1 aDang, Guangyao1 aYang, Mingfeng1 aLi, Yanyan1 aChen, Hongyu1 aJi, Haiwei1 aDong, Lifeng0 tColloids and surfaces.g2020 Jan. 01, v. 185 p.110590-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11946x0927-77657nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfb.2019.1105903Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02577naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002600147245010100173300001800274520135800292592002801650650002501678650002001703650001701723650002101740650002101761650001701782650001401799650001301813650001101826650002101837650001701858650002801875650001501903650002101918650001401939650001001953700003001963773010501993856004802098852000902146655001202155IND50070742220221121055551.0131119e201312  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007074222DNAL7 a10.1007/s11738-013-1372-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJanas, Krystyna Maria10aMelatonin, an underestimated natural substance with great potential for agricultural application  ap. 3285-3292.  aMelatonin (MEL) was thought to be only a neurotransmitter found in vertebrates until its detection in other organisms including plants. Although the number of publications on MEL function in plants is expanding, the knowledge of this subject is still insufficient. Among many functions which MEL performs in plants, its role as an antioxidant and a growth promoter is most supported by experimental evidence. This compound is an independent plant growth regulator and it may mediate the activities of other plant growth regulators. Due to its antioxidant properties MEL may also stabilize cell redox status and protect tissues against reactive oxygen and nitrogen species which accumulated under stressful environment. Some researchers propose that MEL could be used to improve the phytoremediation efficiency of plants against different pollutants. In this paper we show that exogenous MEL applied into the seeds could be a good biostimulator improving not only seed germination, seedling/plant growth but also crop production especially under stress conditions. We also believe that this compound can increase food quality (the aspect of functional food) and may improve human health. Since MEL is inexpensive and safe for animals and humans its application as a biostimulator could be a good, feasible and cost-effective method useful in agriculture.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantioxidant activity 3acrop production 3afood quality 3afunctional foods 3agrowth promotion 3ahuman health 3amelatonin 3anitrogen 3aoxygen 3aphytoremediation 3aplant growth 3aplant growth substances 3apollutants 3aseed germination 3aseedlings 3aseeds1 aPosmyk, Małgorzata Maria0 tActa physiologiae plantarum.g2013 Dec., v. 35, no. 12 p.3285-3292dSpringer-Verlagx0137-58817nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11738-013-1372-0  aDNAL 7aarticle05072naa a2200649 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100005600144245011800200300001800318520306600336592002803402650001303430650001303443650001303456650001303469650001103482650000903493650001603502650001603518650001503534650000903549650001803558650002703576650001703603650002103620650001403641650001403655650000903669650001103678650002803689650002103717650001903738650000703757650001903764650001003783650002303793650001303816650002503829650001603854650000903870653001803879653001703897653001303914700005603927700001803983700005404001700005704055700005504112773015504167856007904322852000904401655001204410IND60705456920221120070920.0200913e202010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070545692DNAL7 a10.3168/jds.2020-184902doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMiller, M.D.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1448-628910aEvaluation of source of corn silage and trace minerals on rumen characteristics and passage rate of Holstein cows  ap. 8864-8879.  aThe effects of source of corn silage and trace mineral on rumen fermentation, turnover, and particle passage rates were evaluated with 8 ruminally cannulated Holstein cows averaging 83 (standard error = 5) days in milk in a replicated 4 × 4 Latin square design with a 2 × 2 factorial arrangement of treatments and 28-d periods. The diets consisted (dry basis) of 55% conventional (CON) or brown midrib-3 (BM3) corn silage, 2% chopped wheat straw, and 43% grain mix with either sulfate (STM) or hydroxy (HTM) source of Cu, Zn, and Mn trace minerals. The targeted supplemental amount of Cu, Zn, and Mn was 194, 1,657, and 687 mg/d, respectively. The dietary treatments were (1) CON-STM, (2) CON-HTM, (3) BM3-STM, and (4) BM3-HTM. Dietary nutrient composition of BM3 diets averaged 32.1% amylase neutral detergent fiber on an organic matter basis (aNDFom) and 6.9% undigested neutral detergent fiber at 240 h of in vitro fermentation (uNDF240om; % of dry matter), and CON diets averaged 36.2% aNDFom and 8.6% uNDF240om (% of dry matter). Data were summarized by period and analyzed as a replicated Latin square design with fixed model effects for corn silage, trace mineral, corn silage and trace mineral interaction, period within replicated square, and replicated square using the MIXED procedure of SAS (version 9.4, SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC). Cow within replicate was a random effect. Daily mean, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum for rumen pH were unaffected by corn silage or trace mineral source. Cows fed the CON diets had greater rumen acetate percentage than cows fed the BM3 diets (65.7 vs. 64.7 molar %). In contrast, cows fed the BM3 diets had greater rumen propionate percentage than cows fed the CON diets (21.4 vs. 20.4 molar %). Total volatile fatty acid concentration was lower for cows fed STM versus HTM in BM3 diets, but not for the cows fed the CON diets. Cows fed the BM3 diets had faster turnover rate and shorter turnover time for uNDF240om than cows fed the CON diets (3.12 vs. 2.86%/h and 33.3 vs. 36.5 h, respectively). Cows fed the BM3 diets had a faster passage rate of small and medium corn silage neutral detergent fiber particles than cows fed the CON diets (5.73 vs. 5.37%/h and 4.74 vs. 4.31%/h, respectively). We observed a corn silage by source of trace mineral interaction on organic matter and uNDF240om rumen pool size and organic matter turnover. Overall, source of corn silage had a pronounced influence on rumen dynamics presumably related to greater in vitro neutral detergent fiber digestibility and lower uNDF240om content of BM3 corn silage that allowed for faster turnover of indigestible neutral detergent fiber and greater passage rate of corn silage particles. In contrast, the source of trace mineral had much less significant effects on rumen fermentation, turnover, and particle passage rates. Corn silage-based diets intended to enhance rumen fiber fermentation, turnover, and passage are more affected by source and digestibility of neutral detergent fiber than source of dietary trace minerals.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHolstein 3aacetates 3aamylases 3acannulas 3acopper 3acorn 3acorn silage 3acow feeding 3adairy cows 3adiet 3adigestibility 3afatty acid composition 3afermentation 3afood composition 3alactation 3amanganese 3amilk 3amodels 3aneutral detergent fiber 3anutrient content 3aorganic matter 3apH 3apropionic acid 3arumen 3arumen fermentation 3asulfates 3avolatile fatty acids 3awheat straw 3azinc 0atrace mineral 0apassage rate 0arumen pH1 aLanier, J.S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3043-78201 aKvidera, S.K.1 aDann, H.M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7372-70111 aBallard, C.S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1371-22561 aGrant, R.J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5797-99160 tJournal of dairy science.g2020 Oct., v. 103, no. 10 p.8864-8879dElsevier Inc.aAmerican Dairy Science AssociationwJournal:jnl45500x0022-03027nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3168/jds.2020-184903Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02119naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100005500147245010400202300001800306520085600324592002801180650001501208650001501223650001601238650001401254650001501268650001701283650001101300650002501311650002201336650001901358700002101377700001801398700002201416700002001438700001901458700001601477700001801493773009601511856008101607852000901688655001201697IND60724916820221119063315.0210124e201806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072491682DNAL7 a10.1016/j.dib.2018.04.0812doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKozar, Nejc1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0934-502410aData on metabolomic profiling of ovarian cancer patients' serum for potential diagnostic biomarkers  ap. 1825-1831.  aThe data presented here are related to the research paper entitled “Metabolomic profiling suggests long chain ceramides and sphingomyelins as a possible diagnostic biomarker of epithelial ovarian cancer.” (Kozar et al., 2018) [1].

This study aimed to determine the regulation of gut microorganism development from fertilized eggs to 150 DAH (days after hatching) and the differences between flatulent and healthy silver pomfret (Pampus argenteus). High‐throughput sequencing was used to analyze the diversity and relative abundance of microorganisms. PICRUSt was used to predict functional alterations of dominant microorganisms. The results showed that from all 42 samples, a total of 3,746,895 reads were obtained, representing 6,081 operational taxonomic units (OTUs). Top 3 phyla were Proteobacteria, Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes. From 0 to 32 DAH, the relative abundance of Proteobacteria continuously increased and peaked at 94.99%. After that, the abundance of Proteobacteria decreased, but Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes increased instead. Alpha diversity is the lowest at 32 DAH, the difference is significant compared with others, p < .05. Comparing flatulent fish with healthy fish, the former has more specific OTUs, higher diversity and abundance. There were four genera Ethanoligenens, Methanobacterium, Caproiciproducens and Leptolinea that only obtained from the flatulent samples, but almost none in the healthy samples. All of these four genera are directly or indirectly involved in gas metabolism. This study enriched the basic research of silver pomfret, for the first time, focused on flatulent individuals which would provide a theoretical basis for the subsequent breeding.  aPublisher supplied data  aY201430481cScientific Research Fund of Zhejiang Provincial Education Departmen  a2016C0003cResearch and Demonstration of Artificial Breeding Technology of silver pomfret, Pampus argenteus  a31772869cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a2019C02059cthe Zhejiang Major Science Project  aLY15C19000cZhejiang Provincial Natural Science Foundation  aLY18C190008cZhejiang Provincial Natural Science Foundation  a2015C110003cThe Key Special Project of Ningbo City (China) in Agriculture  cCollaborative Innovation Center for Zhejiang Marine High‐Efficiency  cLi Dak Sum Yip Yio Chin Kenneth Li Marine Biopharmaceutical Development Fund  cNational 111 Project of China  cNingbo University 3aBacteroidetes 3aFirmicutes 3aMethanobacterium 3aPampus argenteus 3aProteobacteria 3abreeding 3adevelopmental stages 3adigestive system 3adisease susceptibility 3aeggs 3afish 3aflatulence 3ahatching 3ahigh-throughput nucleotide sequencing 3aintestinal microorganisms 3ametabolism 3aontogeny 3aspecies diversity1 aHu, Jiabao1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0970-13321 aWang, Yajun1 aLe, Qijun1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7234-01141 aXu, Shanliang1 aYing, Xinyang1 aYing, Dongxu1 aYang, Yang1 aZhang, Youyi1 aLi, Yaya1 aKuang, Siwen1 aGu, Weiwei1 aSun, Yibo1 aYan, Xiaojun0 tAquaculture research.g2020 Aug., v. 51, no. 8 p.3139-3153dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl53865x1355-557X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/are.146503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03076naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002200149245006900171300001600240500018100256520166700437592002802104650000802132650001302140650002202153650001102175650002002186650001702206650002202223650002102245650001302266650001902279650001002298650002102308650001902329700002102348700002702369700002202396700002102418773011102439856008302550852000902633655001202642IND60614118020221119100728.0181002e201705  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061411802DNAL7 a10.1097/SS.00000000000002092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBierer, Andrew M.10aEffects of Dairy Slurry Injection on Carbon and Nitrogen Cycling  ap. 181-187.  aAffiliations: 1Department of Crop and Soil Environmental Sciences, Virginia Tech, Blacksburg, Virginia. 2Department of Biological Sciences, Virginia Tech, Blacksburg, Virginia.  aSurface broadcast of dairy slurry is a common practice; however, concerns over nuisance odors and nutrient losses have prompted research into alternatives. Manure injection is one practice that addresses these concerns but is not widely adopted. Therefore, two studies were conducted to quantify NH3-N loss by volatilization, impacts on soil N cycling, and microbial response between surface broadcast and subsurface injection of dairy slurry. A constant air flow volatilization chamber system measured NH3-N losses and soil inorganic N, mineralizable carbon, and active microbial biomass. A 40-day static air incubation was performed to study nitrogen transformations over a longer period after application. Statistical significance was evaluated at the α = 0.05 level. In the volatilization study, subsurface injection reduced NH3-N losses by 98% and 87% in a clay loam and sandy loam, respectively, resulting in greater soil inorganic nitrogen compared with surface application. There were no significant differences in active microbial biomass between treatments. Surface application prompted greater microbial respiration in the sandy loam, but there were no significant differences between treatments in the clay loam. In the static incubation study, differences in soil NO3-N became significant on day 28, and by day 40, injection showed increases in soil NO3-N of 13% and 26% in the sandy loam and clay loam, respectively, relative to surface application. While the effect of subsurface injection on soil microbial response was unclear, it remains a tool that can greatly reduce NH3-N losses by volatilization and increase soil plant available nitrogen.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3aair flow 3aammonium nitrogen 3acarbon 3aclay loam soils 3adairy manure 3amicrobial biomass 3anitrate nitrogen 3anitrogen 3anitrogen cycle 3aodors 3asandy loam soils 3avolatilization1 aMaguire, Rory O.1 aStrickland, Michael S.1 aThomason, Wade E.1 aStewart, Ryan D.0 tSoil science.g2017 May, v. 182, no. 5 p.181-187dWolters Kluwer HealthwJournal:jnl44572x0038-075X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1097/SS.00000000000002093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02116naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002000149245006600169300001800235520107900253592002801332650001201360650001101372650000901383650001601392650001801408650002001426650001901446650003901465650002701504700001601531700002201547773010301569856008501672852000901757655001201766IND60532674720221121023813.0160728e20160614xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053267472DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.biochem.6b001762doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIshihara, Kenji10aRole of Ca2+ in the Stability and Function of TMEM16F and 16K  ap. 3180-3188.  aThere are 10 transmembrane protein (TMEM) 16-family proteins in humans and mice. Among them, TMEM16F acts as a Ca²⁺-dependent phospholipid scramblase at the plasma membrane. However, how Ca²⁺ activates TMEM16F’s phospholipid-scramblase activity has not been elucidated. Here we found that in the presence of Ca²⁺, TMEM16K (whose function is unknown) directly binds Ca²⁺ to form a stable complex that can be detected by blue-native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. In the absence of Ca²⁺, TMEM16K and TMEM16F aggregated, suggesting that their structure is stabilized by Ca²⁺. Comprehensive mutagenesis of acidic residues in TMEM16K’s cytoplasmic and transmembrane regions identified five residues that are critical for binding Ca²⁺. These residues were well conserved between TMEM16F and 16K, and point mutations of these residues in TMEM16F reduced its ability to support Ca²⁺-dependent phospholipid scrambling. Our results suggest that Ca²⁺ binds TMEM16F directly and induces conformational changes that support its stability and function.  aPublisher supplied data 3acalcium 3ahumans 3amice 3amutagenesis 3aphospholipids 3aplasma membrane 3apoint mutation 3apolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 3atransmembrane proteins1 aSuzuki, Jun1 aNagata, Shigekazu0 tBiochemistry.g2016 June 14, v. 55, no. 23 p.3180-3188dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-49957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.biochem.6b001763Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02733naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002500144245007200169300001600241520146600257592002801723650001701751650002401768650001201792650001901804650001501823650001301838650001201851650001501863650001801878650001501896650001101911650001601922650001001938651002001948653001301968653002101981653002402002653001502026653001002041700001902051773011802070856007802188852000902266655001202275IND60515876920221118184801.0160321e20140218xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051587692DNAL7 a10.1139/cjfr-2013-04292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aConway, Alexandra J.10aRecent advance of forest–grassland ecotones in southwestern Yukon  ap. 509-520.  aWe investigated recent ecotone dynamics in the forest–grassland mosaics of southwestern Yukon. Our objectives were to determine (i) if forests are encroaching into grasslands, (ii) if rate and extent of encroachment varies by region or with topographic setting, and (iii) if encroachment is related to climate change and variability. Dendroecological techniques were used to obtain dates of establishment for 1847 trees (trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx.) and white spruce (Picea glauca (Moench) Voss)) sampled from 28 sites divided between two different regions and three topographic settings. Generalized linear modeling was used to identify relationships between climate and tree establishment. Results show that encroachment of forest, particularly aspen trees, into grasslands has been nearly ubiquitous on flat terrain and on south-facing slopes in both regions over the last 60–80 years. In contrast, spruce-dominated ecotones on north-facing slopes experienced little change. Aspen establishment was positively associated with spring temperatures and precipitation, although evidence suggests that other factors such as soil moisture interact with climate to mediate the timing and rate of tree encroachment. These results indicate that transformation of grasslands to aspen-dominated forest is an additional, but previously unexplored, element of the widespread ecosystem changes currently being experienced in northwestern North America.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPicea glauca 3aPopulus tremuloides 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3aecosystems 3aecotones 3aforests 3agrasslands 3alinear models 3asoil water 3aspring 3atemperature 3atrees 3aYukon Territory 0aecotones 0adendrochronology 0aforest encroachment 0agrasslands 0aYukon1 aDanby, Ryan K.0 tCanadian journal of forest research =.g2014 Feb. 18, v. 44, no. 5 p.509-520dNRC Research Pressx1208-60377nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjfr-2013-04293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03414naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002300149245014700172300001800319520187300337592002802210650002902238650001702267650002602284650001202310650001702322650002302339650003002362650002202392650002002414650002002434650001002454650001902464650001402483650001302497650001602510650001902526650001702545650001402562700002302576700002602599700002102625700001902646700002302665700002302688773010302711856008502814852000902899655001202908IND60532674820221121023912.0160728e20160614xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053267482DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.biochem.6b001782doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSpadaro, Francesca14aThe Crystal Structure of Burkholderia cenocepacia DfsA Provides Insights into Substrate Recognition and Quorum Sensing Fatty Acid Biosynthesis  ap. 3241-3250.  aBurkholderia cenocepacia is a major concern among respiratory tract infections in cystic fibrosis patients. This pathogen is particularly difficult to treat because of its high level of resistance to the clinically relevant antimicrobial agents. In B. cenocepacia, the quorum sensing cell–cell communication system is involved in different processes that are important for bacterial virulence, such as biofilm formation and protease and siderophore production. Targeting the enzymes involved in this process represents a promising therapeutic approach. With the aim of finding effective quorum sensing inhibitors, we have determined the three-dimensional structure of B. cenocepacia diffusible factor synthase A, DfsA. This bifunctional crotonase (dehydratase/thioesterase) produces the characteristic quorum sensing molecule of B. cenocepacia, cis-2-dodecenoic acid or BDSF, starting from 3-hydroxydodecanoyl-acyl carrier protein. Unexpectedly, the crystal structure revealed the presence of a lipid molecule in the catalytic site of the enzyme, which was identified as dodecanoic acid. Our biochemical characterization shows that DfsA is able to use dodecanoyl-acyl carrier protein as a substrate, demonstrating that dodecanoic acid, the product of this reaction, is released very slowly from the DfsA active site, therefore acting as a DfsA inhibitor. This molecule shows an unprecedented conformational arrangement inside the DfsA active site. In contrast with previous hypotheses, our data illustrate how DfsA and closely related homologous enzymes can recognize long hydrophobic substrates without large conformational changes or assistance by additional regulator molecules. The elucidation of the substrate binding mode in DfsA provides the starting point for structure-based drug discovery studies targeting B. cenocepacia quorum sensing-assisted virulence.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBurkholderia cenocepacia 3aactive sites 3aanti-infective agents 3abiofilm 3abiosynthesis 3acell communication 3acommunications technology 3acrystal structure 3acystic fibrosis 3adodecanoic acid 3adrugs 3ahydrophobicity 3apathogens 3apatients 3aproteinases 3aquorum sensing 3asiderophores 3avirulence1 aScoffone, Viola

For each of these peptides, entry of its newly synthesized precursor into the ER lumen is followed by transport through the secretory pathway, exposing the precursor to a sequence of environments and enzymes that produce the bioactive products stored in mature granules. A final step in the biosynthesis of many peptides is C‐terminal amidation by peptidylglycine α‐amidating monooxygenase (PAM), an ascorbate‐ and copper‐dependent membrane enzyme that enters secretory granules along with its soluble substrates. Biochemical and cell biological studies elucidated the highly conserved mechanism for amidated peptide production and raised many questions about PAM trafficking and the effects of PAM on cytoskeletal organization and gene expression. Phylogenetic studies and the discovery of active PAM in the ciliary membranes of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, a green alga lacking secretory granules, suggested that a PAM‐like enzyme was present in the last eukaryotic common ancestor. While the catalytic features of human and C. reinhardtii PAM are strikingly similar, the trafficking of PAM in C. reinhardtii and neuroendocrine cells and secretion of its amidated products differ. A comparison of PAM function in neuroendocrine cells, atrial myocytes, and C. reinhardtii reveals multiple ways in which altered trafficking allows PAM to accomplish different tasks in different species and cell types.  aPublisher supplied data  aDK‐032948cNational Institutes of Health  aDK‐032949cNational Institutes of Health  aGM‐125606cNational Institutes of Health  cRodney and Janice Reynolds Endowment  cDaniel Schwartzberg Fund  cFinska Läkaresällskapet  cPerklén Foundation 3aChlamydomonas reinhardtii 3aancestry 3abiosynthesis 3acardiomyocytes 3acytoskeleton 3aenzymes 3agene expression 3ahumans 3ainsulin 3aoxytocin 3aphylogeny 3asecretion 3avasopressin1 aMains, Richard E.1 aEipper, Betty A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1171-55570 tFEBS journal.g2022 Aug., v. 289, no. 15 p.4470-4496dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3943524x1742-464X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/febs.160493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02330naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245014500169300001800314520104800332592002801380650006901408650002401477650002501501650001901526650002301545650002001568650001201588650001501600650001601615650001901631650000901650650000901659650001801668650001301686651001001699700002501709773009601734856008101830852000901911655001201920IND60724917120221119063224.0210124e201808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072491712DNAL7 a10.1016/j.dib.2018.04.0852doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAguilera, Héctor10aData on chemical composition of soil and water in the semiarid wetland of Las Tablas de Damiel National Park (Spain) during a drought period  ap. 2481-2486.  aLas Tablas de Daimiel National Park (TDNP) is a Ramsar Mediterranean wetland area designated as Biosphere Reserve by Unesco. The whole system dried out during a long drought period in the past decade (2006–2009) and a smouldering peat fire took place in 2009. The physical and chemical properties of sediments were significantly disturbed by the fire. To date, the ecological system has not fully recovered from the impact. We present a raw data collection of the chemical composition of soil, groundwater and surface water sampled over four consecutive years in 2006–2010. The data include major and minor anions and cations, nutrients and heavy metals. Sampling points were located inside and outside TDNP both upstream as well as downstream. The information provided can be used to analyse the medium and long term impact of drought and smouldering fire to the TDNP environment. It is also a baseline for hydro-ecological modelling of the impact of climate change in arid and semiarid wetlands to develop adaptive management strategies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aUnited Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization 3aadaptive management 3achemical composition 3aclimate change 3aconservation areas 3adata collection 3adrought 3aecosystems 3agroundwater 3anational parks 3apeat 3asoil 3asurface water 3awetlands 3aSpain1 aMoreno Merino, Luis,0 tData in Brief.g2018 Aug., v. 19 p.2481-2486dElsevier Inc.wJournal:23203x2352-34097nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.dib.2018.04.0853Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03469naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001400148245013600162300001600298520172700314592002802041650002002069650002402089650001402113650001602127650001402143650001202157650001302169650002802182650001602210650001102226650001902237650002502256650001202281650001902293650000902312650001302321650001602334651001002350653001102360653001402371653002502385653001502410653001602425653001802441700001702459700006102476700001602537700001602553700001402569700001202583700001702595700001502612700001702627773011902644856008302763852000902846655001202855IND60730521120221119092553.0211213e202111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073052112DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tifs.2021.03.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Di12aA comparative overview on chili pepper (capsicum genus) and sichuan pepper (zanthoxylum genus): From pungent spices to pharma-foods  ap. 148-162.  aBoth Chili pepper (CP) and Sichuan pepper (SP) have long been used for culinary purposes throughout Asia. It is well known CP and SP are well accompanied in Sichuan Cuisine, producing a typical pungent sensation. In recent decades, increasing evidences suggest a series of health benefits and pharmacological effects are associated to the two peppers. Now, a systematic comparison of structural and bioactivities diversity of bioactive ingredients from edible parts of two peppers are necessary to address their future application.Bioactive composition, organoleptic property as well as pharmacological activity in cellular, animal, and human subjects are compared between SP (pericarps and leaves) and CP (fruits).Both SP and CP are rich in alklyamides, polyphenols, and odorants but their structures are greatly variable. Carotenoids are primarily identified in CP but rather in SP, whereas coumarins are the specific ingredients in SP as compared with CP. Pungent sensations evoked by capsainoids and sanshools are obvious distinct, which is attributed to different mechanisms of interaction with membrane ion channels. Due to these bioactives, especially for capsaicin and hydroxyl-α-sanshool, extracts and purified compounds of CP and SP presented attenuation effects against pain, obesity and hyperlipidemia, diabetes, atherosclerosis, gastrointestinal disorder, tumors, and neurodegenerative diseases even though large-scale and well-designed clinical trials are highly needed. However, more approaches should be conducted to overcome side effects of capsaicin during clinical application. Also, the pharmacological interaction among bioactives in two peppers should be further verified in physiological condition.  aPublisher supplied data 3aatherosclerosis 3abioactive compounds 3acapsaicin 3acarotenoids 3acoumarins 3acuisine 3adiabetes 3agastrointestinal system 3ahot peppers 3ahumans 3ahyperlipidemia 3amedicinal properties 3aobesity 3aodor compounds 3apain 3apericarp 3apolyphenols 3aChina 0aSpices 0aCapsaicin 0aHydroxyl-α-sanshool 0aFlavonoids 0aAlkylamides 0aClinical uses1 aSun, Xiaoxia1 aBattino, Maurizio1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7250-17821 aWei, Xiaoou1 aShi, Jiyong1 aZhao, Lei1 aLiu, Si1 aXiao, Jianbo1 aShi, Bolin1 aXiaobo, Zou,0 tTrends in food science & technology.g2021 Nov., v. 117 p.148-162dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl45707x0924-22447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tifs.2021.03.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02569naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002400139245009200163300001600255500002000271500001500291520148900306592002801795650001401823650001301837650001401850650001701864650001701881650001001898651001801908653001801926700002401944700002101968700002801989773009602017856007302113852000902186655001202195IND60523627620221122063735.0160623e201202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052362762DNAL7 a10.1890/11-1360.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDavies, T.

How strongly species traits co‐vary with phylogeny can significantly impact how we analyze cross‐species data and can influence our interpretation of assembly rules in the rapidly expanding field of community phylogenetics. Phylogenetic conservatism is typically quantified by analyzing the distribution of species values on the phylogenetic tree that connects them. Many phylogenetic approaches, however, assume a completely sampled phylogeny: while we have good estimates of deeper phylogenetic relationships for many species‐rich groups, such as birds and flowering plants, we often lack information on more recent interspecific relationships (i.e., within a genus). A common solution has been to represent these relationships as polytomies on trees using taxonomy as a guide. Here we show that such trees can dramatically inflate estimates of phylogenetic conservatism quantified using S. P. Blomberg et al.'s K statistic. Using simulations, we show that even randomly generated traits can appear to be phylogenetically conserved on poorly resolved trees. We provide a simple rarefaction‐based solution that can reliably retrieve unbiased estimates of K, and we illustrate our method using data on first flowering times from Thoreau's woods (Concord, Massachusetts, USA).  aPublisher supplied data 3aflowering 3ataxonomy 3aphylogeny 3abiogeography 3aAngiospermae 3abirds 3aMassachusetts 0aMagnoliophyta1 aKraft, Nathan J.

The main components were galactose and sulfate presenting low protein contamination. These sulfated galactans (F1.0) showed a polydisperse profile, and signs in infrared analysis were attributed to a sulfate ester S = O bond, the presence of a 3,6-anhydrogalactose C–O bond, nonsulfated β-D-galactose, and a C–O–SO4 bond in galactose C4. The NMR analysis showed signals at about 95 and 92 attributed to anomeric carbon of 4-linked 3,6-anhydro-α-D-galactopyranose residue of κ-carrageenans and 4-linked 3,6-anhydro-α-D-galactopyranose2-sulfate of ι-carrageenans. Sulfated galactan F1.0 showed strong antioxidant activity under lipid peroxidation assay where F1.0 at 8 mg mL−1 promoted 57.92% peroxidation inhibition and displayed the scavenging activity on hydroxyl radicals in a dose-dependent manner leading to 32.5% scavenging of these radicals when 5 mg mL−1 of sulfated galactan F1.0 was used. The sulfated galactan fraction also exhibited strong inhibition on the H2O2-induced hemolysis model. Sulfated galactan F1.0 displayed low cytotoxic action in 3 T3 cells and moderate antitumoral action in HeLa cells. These results suggest that sulfated galactan F1.0 from H. musciformis has antioxidant potential, which is a great effect for a compound used as food and in the food industry.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHypnea 3aantioxidant activity 3acarbon 3acell viability 3acytotoxicity 3afood industry 3agalactans 3ahemolysis 3ahydroxyl radicals 3ainfrared spectroscopy 3alipid peroxidation 3amacroalgae 3amolecular weight 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy1 aDore, Celina Maria Pinto G.1 aCastro, Allisson Jhonatan G.1 ado Nascimento, Marília Silva1 aCruz, Ana Katarina M.1 aSoriano, Eliane M.1 aBenevides, Norma M.

This unique technology allowed to process semicrystalline PBSA as confined polymer and amorphous PLA as confining polymer in a continuous manner. The continuity of PBSA layers within the 80/20 wt % PLA/PBSA layered films was clearly evidenced by atomic force microscopy (AFM). Similar thermal events to the reference films were revealed by thermal studies; indicating no diffusion of polymers during the melt-processing. Mechanical properties were measured for the multilayer film and the obtained results were those expected considering the fraction of each polymer, revealing the absence of delamination in the PLA/PBSA multinanolayer film. The confinement effect induced by PLA led to a slight orientation of the crystals, an increase of the rigid amorphous fraction (RAF) in PBSA with a densification of this fraction without changing film crystallinity. These structural changes allowed to strongly improve the water vapor and gas barrier properties of the PBSA layer into the multilayer film up to two decades in the case of CO₂ gas. By confining the PBSA structure in very thin and continuous layers, it was then possible to improve the barrier performances of a biodegradable system and the resulting barrier properties were successfully correlated to the effect of confinement on the microstructure and the chain segment mobility of the amorphous phase. Such investigation on these multinanolayers of PLA/PBSA with the aim of evidencing relationships between microstructure implying RAF and barrier performances has never been performed yet. Besides, gas and water permeation results have shown that the barrier improvement obtained from the multilayer was mainly due to the reduction of solubility linked to the reduction of the free volume while the tortuosity effect, as usually expected, was not really observed. This work brings new insights in the field of physicochemical behaviors of new multilayer films made of biodegradable polyesters but also in interfacial processes due to the confinement effect induced in these multinanolayer structures obtained by the forced assembly coextrusion. This original coextrusion process was a very advantageous technique to produce eco-friendly materials with functional properties without the help of tie layer, additives, solvents, surface treatments, or inorganic fillers.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadditives 3aatomic force microscopy 3abiodegradability 3acarbon dioxide 3acrystal structure 3acrystals 3adelamination 3afunctional properties 3amechanical properties 3amicrostructure 3apolyesters 3apolylactic acid 3asolubility 3asolvents 3awater vapor 0amultilayer polymer film 0acoextrusion 0aconfined crystallization 0apermeability 0apoly(lactic acid) 0apoly(butylene succinate-co-butylene adipate) 0abarrier properties1 aFollain, Nadege,1 aGuinault, Alain1 aSollogoub, Cyrille1 aGaucher, Valérie1 aDelpouve, Nicolas1 aMarais, Stéphane,0 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2017 Aug. 30, v. 9, no. 34 p.29101-29112dAmerican Chemical Societyx1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facsami.7b084043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02407naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002000146245015500166500002200321520077700343592002801120650002801148650003201176650001201208650001701220650002401237650001701261650002101278650002601299650001701325650001901342650002101361653004701382653001201429653002101441653001701462653001301479653001401492653000801506653000801514653000801522653000801530653000901538653000801547653000801555653000701563653000801570653000901578653000901587700001901596700002201615700002201637773006901659856008001728852000901808655001201817IND60573318020221121051522.0170724s2017    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057331802DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ab.2017.07.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBaev, Artyom Y.10aOsmotic regulation of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore investigated by light scattering, fluorescence and electron microscopy techniques  aPre-press version  aMitochondrial permeability transition (PT) is a phenomenon of an increase of the inner membrane permeability in response to an excessive matrix calcium accumulation. PTP is caused by the opening of the large weakly selective channel. Molecular composition and regulation of permeability transition pore (PTP) are not well understood. Here we used isolated mitochondria to investigate dependence of PTP activation on the osmotic pressure. We found that in low osmotic strength solution calcium-induced PTP is significantly inhibited. We propose that this effect is linked to the changes in the curvature of the mitochondrial inner membrane. This interpretation is consistent with the idea about the importance of ATP synthase dimerization in modulation of the PTP activity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aH+/K+-exchanging ATPase 3aH-transporting ATP synthase 3acalcium 3adimerization 3aelectron microscopy 3afluorescence 3alight scattering 3amembrane permeability 3amitochondria 3aosmoregulation 3aosmotic pressure 0aMitochondrial permeability transition pore 0aCalcium 0aOsmotic pressure 0aATP-synthase 0aSwelling 0aC-subunit 0aPTP 0aADP 0aATP 0aAla 0amOsm 0aCsA 0aCRC 0aRC 0aP/O 0aCCCP 0aCyPD1 aElustondo, Pia1 aNegoda, Alexander1 aPavlov, Evgeny V.0 tAnalytical biochemistry.g2017, dElsevier Inc.x0003-26977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ab.2017.07.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02669naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100005900146245011800205300002000323520133500343592002801678650001501706650001301721650002301734650003101757650001201788700003201800700001901832700002601851700002401877700002301901700005601924700006201980700002502042773013902067856008002206852000902286655001202295IND60752164420220218000000.0211001e20210921xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075216442DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.1c068592doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDobryden, Illia1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6877-928210aLocal Wear of Catechol-Containing Diblock Copolymer Layers: Wear Volume, Stick–Slip, and Nanomechanical Changes  ap. 21277-21292.  aPolymers containing catechol groups have gained a large interest, as they mimic an essential feature of mussel adhesive proteins that allow strong binding to a large variety of surfaces under water. This feature has made this class of polymers interesting for surface modification purposes, as layer functionalities can be introduced by a simple adsorption process, where the catechol groups should provide a strong anchoring to the surface. In this work, we utilize an AFM-based method to evaluate the wear resistance of such polymer layers in water and compare it with that offered by electrostatically driven adsorption. We pay particular attention to two block copolymer systems where the anchoring group in one case is an uncharged catechol-containing block and in the other case a positively charged and catechol-containing block. The wear resistance is evaluated in terms of wear volume, and here, we compare with data for similar copolymers with statistical distribution of the catechol groups. Monitoring of nanomechanical properties provides an alternative way of illustrating the effect of wear, and we use modeling to show that the stiffness, as probed by an AFM tip, of the soft layer residing on a hard substrate increases as the thickness of the layer decreases. The stick–slip characteristics are also evaluated.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3acatechol 3acomposite polymers 3aelectrostatic interactions 3amussels1 aSteponavičiu̅tė, Medeina1 aHedman, Daniel1 aKlimkevičius, Vaidas1 aMakuška, Ričardas1 aDėdinaitė, Andra1 aLiu, Xiaoyan1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5503-015X1 aCorkery, Robert W.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7461-22321 aClaesson, Per Martin0 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2021 Sept. 21, v. 125, no. 38 p.21277-21292dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23573x1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.1c068593Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02830naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002500150245006200175300001400237520149500251592002801746650001201774650001601786650001301802650001401815650001901829650003001848650001101878650001301889650001801902650001201920650001501932650001601947650001101963650001801974650001701992653001202009653001502021653001102036653002102047653001602068653001302084700002602097700002302123773009702146856008402243852000902327655001202336IND60603354920221121014716.0180716e201504  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060335492DNAL7 a10.1016/j.powtec.2014.09.0212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOostveen, Merel L.M.10aQuantification of powder wetting by drop penetration time  ap. 62-66.  aWe quantify the wetting step of rehydration of a food powder by studying drop penetration times (DPTs) in powder beds. A single droplet is placed on powder beds with various porosities and DPT is recorded by a digital microscope camera. DPTs for corn starch, potato starch and wheat starch are compared to the model proposed by Hapgood et al. (2002). Characterization of the internal structure of miniature powder beds is performed using a Phoenix microCT.Loosely packed powder beds show expected macrovoids and recorded DPTs are within an order of magnitude of the theoretical predictions. However, DPTs for starches deviate from predicted values. We study the effect of moisture content and internal porosity and suggest two model adaptions.Visual observations indicate that the drop penetration area within the bed exceeds the drawing area of the droplet itself. Adaptation of the model for the drop penetration area by constant factor increases DPTs, leading to better correspondence between experimental and theoretical DPTs. Most promising results are obtained by replacement of the effective pore radius predicted by the Carman–Kozeny equation with the experimentally observed pore radius seen in microCT imaging. Theoretical DPTs predicted by this semi-empirical model are in good agreement with experimental results. This is promising for the application of the current method to various food powders, to control quality, optimize properties or tackle problems during production.  aPublisher supplied data 3acameras 3acorn starch 3adroplets 3aequations 3aimage analysis 3amicro-computed tomography 3amodels 3aporosity 3apotato starch 3apowders 3aprediction 3arehydration 3astarch 3awater content 3awheat starch 0aWetting 0aPowder bed 0aStarch 0aDrop penetration 0aRehydration 0aPorosity1 aMeesters, Gabrie M.H.1 avan Ommen, J.

Aerosols were added to the narrowband LW scheme based on their typical schematic observed spectral and vertical behaviour over European land areas. This was found to agree also with the spectral aerosol data from the Lan Zhou University Semi-Arid Climate Observatory and Laboratory measurement stations in the north-western China.A volcanic stratospheric aerosol load was found to induce local LW warming and a stronger column “greenhouse effect” than a doubled CO2 concentration. A heavy near-surface aerosol load was found to increase the downwelling LW radiation to the surface and to reduce the outgoing LW radiation, acting very much like a thin low cloud in increasing the LW greenhouse effect of the atmosphere. The short wave reflection of white aerosol has, however, stronger impact in general, but the aerosol LW greenhouse effect is non-negligible under heavy aerosol loads.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaerosols 3acarbon dioxide 3aglobal warming 3agreenhouse effect 3alatitude 3asemiarid zones 3astratosphere 3asummer 0aAerosols 0aLong wave radiation 0aRadiative forcing 0aLong wave heating rate1 aSavijärvi, H.0 tAtmospheric research.g2014 Jan., v. 135-136 p.102-111dElsevier B.V.x0169-80957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.atmosres.2013.08.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02579naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001500147245013300162300001600295520142700311592002801738650002201766650002401788650001101812650001301823650001801836650001501854650001101869650001201880651001001892700002401902700002801926700001501954700002001969773012501989856008202114852000902196655001202205IND60595027320221123020826.0180619e201808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059502732DNAL7 a10.1007/s10750-018-3604-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Chao10aEnhanced ecological indication based on combined planktic and benthic functional approaches in large river phytoplankton ecology  ap. 163-175.  aThe occurrence of benthic diatoms in large river plankton is considered to be highly stochastic. Accordingly, the widely applied phytoplankton functional group concept sensu Reynolds (FG) classifies all benthic diatom taxa together. Based on data of a high-frequency 1-year long phytoplankton survey of the Pearl River (China), we tested whether the combination of the FG system with various trait-based classifications of benthic diatoms enhances our ability in predicting the community composition from the local environment. Using the Self-Organizing Map approach, we identified characteristic community compositions based on (i) taxonomic data, (ii) the FG approach, and (iii) the FG system combined with trait-based functional approaches of benthic diatoms: size structure, ecological guilds, and eco-morphological groups. All combined functional approaches enabled better predictions for the community composition than the taxonomic data or the FG system alone. The most reliable approach was the combination of the FG system with ecological guilds of benthic diatoms. Therefore, the occurrence of benthic diatoms in large river phytoplankton can be assessed ecologically in a meaningful way based on combined planktic and benthic functional classifications. The application of this approach seems to be highly relevant in large river phytoplankton ecology, ecological modelling, or in ecological status indication.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillariophyceae 3acommunity structure 3amodels 3amoieties 3aphytoplankton 3aprediction 3arivers 3asurveys 3aChina1 aB-Béres, Viktória1 aStenger-Kovács, Csilla1 aLi, Xinhui1 aAbonyi, András0 tHydrobiologia.g2018 Aug., v. 818, no. 1 p.163-175dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl42390x0018-81587nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-018-3604-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02728naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001500164245012200179300001600301520113000317592002801447650001901475650002601494650001601520650001601536650002501552650001701577650001501594650001301609650001501622650001501637650001201652650002101664650001601685650002501701650001901726650001701745650002601762650007001788650001701858650003901875650002501914650001401939700001301953700001901966700001501985700001602000773011302016856004802129852000902177655001202186IND4447681620221121160349.0121003e201102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444768162DNAL7 a209414902pmid7 a10.1007/s00253-010-2923-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQin, Sheng10aBiodiversity, bioactive natural products and biotechnological potential of plant-associated endophytic actinobacteria  ap. 457-473.  aEndophytic actinobacteria, which exist in the inner tissues of living plants, have attracted increasing attention among taxonomists, ecologists, agronomists, chemists and evolutionary biologists. Numerous studies have indicated that these prolific actinobacteria appear to have a capacity to produce an impressive array of secondary metabolites exhibiting a wide variety of biological activity, such as antibiotics, antitumor and anti-infection agents, plant growth promoters and enzymes, and may contribute to their host plants by promoting growth and enhancing their ability of withstanding the environmental stresses.

Total concentrations of the 7 BUVSs in house dust ranged from ND (not detected) to 1020ng/g in Malate and ND to 277ng/g in Payatas. Among the target compounds, the most abundant BUVS was UV-234, with a median value of 84ng/g (ND-813ng/g) in Malate and 41ng/g (ND-212ng/g) in Payatas, respectively. Significantly higher concentrations of UV-326 (p<0.01) and UV-327 (p<0.05) were found in house dust samples from Malate than those from Payatas, suggesting that the household products are the major sources of contamination in the indoor microenvironment. The estimated daily intakes (EDIs) of BUVSs through house dust ingestion in the Philippines were two to four orders of magnitude lower than the guideline values. However, the EDI of 5 BUVSs for toddlers in this study was 5 times higher than those for adults, suggesting that toddlers are at higher risk. House dust may be an important exposure route of UV-234 (88%) and UV-326 (69%) in worst-case scenarios, which using high dust ingestion and worst-case exposure (P95). To our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive study on BUVSs in house dust samples from Asian developing countries and reporting the occurrence of UV-234 and UV-320 in dust samples.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadults 3aaverage daily intake 3adeveloping countries 3adietary exposure 3adust 3aguidelines 3ahousehold products 3ahumans 3aingestion 3aresidential areas 3arisk 3astabilizers 3atoddlers 2aAdult 2aAir Pollutantsxanalysisxmetabolism. 2aAir Pollution, Indoorxanalysis 2aChild, Preschool 2aChromatography, High Pressure Liquid 2aDustxanalysis 2aEnvironmental Exposure 2aEnvironmental Monitoring 2aHousing 2aHumans 2aRefuse Disposal 2aResidence Characteristics 2aSpectrometry, Mass, Electrospray Ionization 2aTandem Mass Spectrometry 2aTriazolesxanalysisxmetabolism. 3aPhilippines 0aPhilippines1 aIsobe, Tomohiko1 aMalarvannan, Govindan1 aSudaryanto, Agus1 aChang, Kwang-Hyeon1 aPrudente, Maricar1 aTanabe, Shinsuke0 tScience of the total environment.g2012 May 1, v. 424 p.174-181dElsevier B.V.x0048-96977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2012.02.0403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02538naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002200146245008800168300002000256520156700276592002801843650001501871650001501886650001101901700006001912700006001972773013902032856008002171852000902251655001202260IND60752164620220218000000.0211001e20210915xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075216462DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.1c069692doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuerrini, Michele10aLong-Range Order Promotes Charge-Transfer Excitations in Donor/Acceptor Co-Crystals  ap. 20821-20830.  aElectronic and optical properties of doped organic semiconductors are dominated by local interactions between donor and acceptor molecules. However, when such systems are in crystalline forms, long-range order competes against short-range couplings. In a first-principles study on three experimentally resolved bulk structures of quaterthiophene doped with (fluorinated) tetracyanoquinodimethane, we demonstrate the crucial role of long-range interactions in donor/acceptor co-crystals. The band structures of the investigated materials exhibit direct band gaps decreasing in size with increasing amount of F atoms in the acceptors. The valence band maximum and conduction band minimum are found at the Brillouin zone boundary and the corresponding wavefunctions are segregated on donor and acceptor molecules, respectively. With the aid of a tight-binding model, we rationalize that the mechanisms responsible for these behaviors, which are ubiquitous in donor/acceptor co-crystals, are driven by long-range interactions. The optical response of the analyzed co-crystals is highly anisotropic. The absorption onset is dominated by an intense resonance, corresponding to a charge-transfer excitation. Long-range interactions are again responsible for this behavior, which enhances the efficiency of the co-crystals for photo-induced charge separation and transport. In addition to these results, our study clarifies that cluster models, accounting only for local interactions, cannot capture the relevant impact of long-range order in donor/acceptor co-crystals.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3aanisotropy 3amodels1 aValencia, Ana M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0095-36801 aCocchi, Caterina1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9243-94610 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2021 Sept. 15, v. 125, no. 38 p.20821-20830dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23573x1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.1c069693Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03050naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004000111040001800151100001900169245010500188300001800293500001500311520111800326592002801444650001301472650000901485650001901494650001901513650001501532650004101547650002201588650001401610650002001624650001901644650001201663650002801675650003001703650001501733650005801748650001701806650006201823650001101885650007601896650005501972650003702027650004002064650000902104650001702113650002502130650002902155650003002184653004002214700001802254773009302272856008602365852000902451655001202460IND4465464320221120041437.0141111e20120915xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446546432DNAL7 a231077302pmid7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2012.03.0192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Chien-Li10aRed mold dioscorea: A potentially safe traditional function food for the treatment of hyperlipidemia  ap. 1074-1080.  a2019-12-06  aA study was undertaken to evaluate whether the interaction between Monascus-fermented products and lovastatin contributes to increased risk of rhabdomyolysis. Rhabdomyolysis is a potentially dangerous side effect of statin drugs. In this study with hyperlipidemic hamsters fed lovastatin only, lovastatin with 1-fold red mold dioscorea (RMD), and lovastatin, the functional components of red mold fermented products, HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, did not exacerbate pre-existing diseases, and actually helped in improving existing disease conditions, respectively, as compared with the control. Administration of RMD, alone or in combination with lovastatin did not cause significant rhabdomyolysis as assessed by measuring the levels of creatinine phosphokinase. Further, we did not find any study that clearly implicates the involvement of RMD, which have long been considered a food product, in liver and kidney toxicity. RMD alone or in combination with lovastatin, does not increase the risk of rhabdomyolysis, even when administered at a high dosage (including HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors >75mg/day/adult).  aPublisher supplied data 3ahamsters 3arisk 3ahyperlipidemia 3arhabdomyolysis 3alovastatin 3ahydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductases 3atraditional foods 3aDioscorea 3aadverse effects 3ahepatotoxicity 2aAnimals 2aCholesterolxmetabolism 2aCombined Modality Therapy 2aCricetinae 2aDioscoreaxadverse effectsxmetabolismxmicrobiology. 2aFermentation 2aFunctional Foodxadverse effectsxanalysisxmicrobiology. 2aHumans 2aHyperlipidemiasxcomplicationsxdiet therapyxdrug therapyxmetabolism. 2aHypolipidemic Agentsxadverse effectsxmetabolism. 2aLiverxdrug effectsxmetabolism. 2aLovastatinxadministration & dosage 2aMale 2aMesocricetus 2aMonascusxmetabolism 2aRhabdomyolysisxetiology 2aTriglyceridesxmetabolism 0ahydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase1 aPan, Tzu-Ming0 tFood chemistry.g2012 Sept. 15, v. 134, no. 2 p.1074-1080dElsevier Ltdx0308-81467nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2012.03.0193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03488naa a2200673 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002700113040001800140100002100158245011800179300001500297520159800312592002801910650004701938650001101985650001701996650002102013650000902034650001502043650001402058650000902072650001202081650001102093650001102104650001702115650001202132650001802144650007202162650001102234650001702245650002302262650002202285650001102307650000902318650005802327650001802385650001302403650001202416650004602428651001102474651001802485651001802503651001802521700001302539700001602552700001502568700001302583700001602596700001602612700001502628700001602643773009402659856004002753852000902793655001202802IND50073023120221117233506.0140214e201403  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007302312DNAL7 a236789472pmid7 a10.1111/zph.120502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBair‐Brake, H.10aIs That a Rodent in Your Luggage? A Mixed Method Approach to Describe Bushmeat Importation into the United States  ap. 97-104.  aBushmeat, defined as meat derived from wild animals, is a potential source of zoonotic pathogens. Bushmeat from restricted animals is illegal to import into the United States under US federal regulations. We reviewed US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) port of entry surveillance records from September 2005 through December 2010 and conducted focus group studies to describe trends in and reasons for bushmeat importation into the United States. In total, 543 confiscated bushmeat items were recorded. Half of the confiscated bushmeat items identified were rodents. Africa was the most frequent continent of origin. Seasonality was evident, with bushmeat confiscations peaking in late spring to early summer. Four times more bushmeat was confiscated during an enhanced surveillance period in June 2010 compared with the same period in previous years, suggesting that routine surveillance underestimated the amount of bushmeat detected at US Ports of Entry. Focus groups held in three major US cities revealed that bushmeat importation is a multifaceted issue. Longstanding cultural practices of hunting and eating bushmeat make it difficult for consumers to acknowledge potential health and ecologic risks. Also, US merchants selling African goods, including bushmeat, in their stores have caused confusion among importers as to whether importation is truly illegal. Enhancing routine surveillance for bushmeat and consistent enforcement of penalties at all ports of entry, along with health education aimed at bushmeat importers, might be useful to deter illegal importation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCenters for Disease Control and Prevention 3acities 3afocus groups 3ahealth education 3ameat 3amonitoring 3apathogens 3arisk 3arodents 3aspring 3asummer 3awild animals 2aAnimals 2aAnimals, Wild 2aCommercexlegislation & jurisprudencexstatistics & numerical data. 2aFemale 2aFocus Groups 2aFood Contamination 2aFood Microbiology 2aHumans 2aMale 2aMeatxmicrobiologyxstandardsxsupply & distribution. 2aPublic Health 2aRodentia 2aSeasons 2aZoonosesxetiologyxprevention & control. 3aAfrica 3aUnited States 0aAfrica, West. 0aUnited States1 aBell, T.1 aHiggins, A.1 aBailey, N.1 aDuda, M.1 aShapiro, S.1 aEves, H.

Several inversion algorithms are used to retrieve aerosol properties, primarily aerosol optical depth (AOD). Satellite aerosol products are available from several moderate spatial resolution sensors and provide information on the spatial and temporal dynamics of aerosol concentration. This study provides an evaluation and inter-comparison of multiple aerosol products from Terra and Aqua Moderate Resolution and Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Suomi National Polar-Orbiting Partnership (Suomi NPP) Visible-Infrared Imager Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) between 2014 and 2018 in the Eastern Mediterranean and the Black Sea. This evaluation focuses on four MODIS aerosol products including Dark Target (DT) AOD retrievals at 10-km and 3-km spatial resolutions, Deep Blue (DB) AOD retrievals at10-km spatial resolution, Multi-Angle Implementation of Atmospheric Correction (MAIAC) AOD retrievals at 1-km spatial resolution, and VIIRS DB AOD retrievals at 6-km spatial resolution. Satellite-based AOD retrievals are validated against in-situ AOD measurements from three AERONET ground stations located in urban/land, rural/coastal, and ocean surfaces.The results show that Pearson's correlation coefficient (r) between the satellite AOD retrievals and AERONET AOD measurements range between 0.45 and 0.93 whilst the Root-Mean-Squared Errors (RMSE) varies from 0.047 to 0.159 which highlights the reliability of satellite AOD retrievals' in the region. The best performing products over the urban/land surface are the MODIS MAIAC and VIIRS DB aerosol products with the RMSE of 0.048–0.061 and a higher percentage (81%–89%) of retrievals falling within expected error for land. Over the ocean, the MODIS DT aerosol products have the lowest errors (RMSE 0.047–0.061) and the highest percentage (70%–80%) of retrievals falling within the expected error. The performances of all algorithms over the rural/coastal region are poorer in terms of over- and under-estimations of AOD with a small percentage of retrievals (48%–87%) within expected error. Among the satellite aerosol products, the VIIRS aerosol product performs better over the coastal area in terms of high correlation coefficient (r = 0.88), low error (RMSE = 0.059), and the large percentage of retrievals within expected error (88%). The poor performance found over the more complex coastal regions suggests further improvements are needed in land-water-sediment masks, surface reflectance estimation, and aerosol model assumptions over mixed surface types.The aerosol products show the highest agreement (r ∼ 0.77–0.98) over the ocean surface whilst the coastal site aerosol products verified the greatest dissimilarity in aerosol loading variations (r ∼ 0.50–0.91). Lastly, the good correlation (r > 0.73) between the VIIRS and MODIS AOD products illustrates the potential of VIIRS to provide aerosol data continuity with MODIS.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaerosols 3aclimate 3acoasts 3aenvironment 3agovernmental programs and projects 3ahuman health 3areflectance 3asatellites 3atemporal variation 3aBlack Sea 0aMODIS 0aVIIRS 0aAERONET 0aDB 0aDT 0aMAIAC 0aValidation 0aInter-comparisons1 aRoberts, Gareth1 aKaya, Şinasi,1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4962-04921 aVēlāyutan̲, T.

In this paper, we have assessed the role of livelihood diversification in household well-being in Humla, a remote mountain district in west Nepal. Employing the data produced from household surveys, we developed a composite household well-being index incorporating four components and 15 indicators, and measured the effect of diversification on it. Results suggested a uniform pattern of diversification in terms of the number of activities undertaken for livelihoods but a highly varying degree of resultant well-being across households. Analysis showed that well-being was not associated with diversification per se but rather on a households' involvement in ‘high return sectors’ such as trade or salaried job. Because involvement in these remunerative sectors is determined by various financial, social and human capitals, poor households were unable to combat the entry barrier and were prevented from getting access to them. In this way, livelihood diversification was found to have a highly skewed effect leading to inequality of income and well-being. This, in turn, is likely to risk depriving the poor households from exploiting new economic opportunities even in the future.  aPublisher supplied data 3ahousehold surveys 3ahouseholds 3ahumans 3alivelihood 3apoverty 3asocial inequality 3atrade 3aNepal 0aDiversification 0aWell-being 0aCaste 0aInequality 0aNepal1 aAndersen, Peter0 tJournal of rural studies.g2016 Apr., v. 44 p.239-249dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl38039x0743-01677nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jrurstud.2016.02.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04541naa a2200961 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245012300167500001400290520213300304592002802437650003402465650001702499650001602516650002402532650000902556650001602565650003102581650001002612650001202622650000902634650001902643650001702662650001202679650002202691650003002713650001502743650002102758650001002779650000902789650002202798650001702820650001202837650001702849650002002866650001402886651001002900653000802910653003802918653001902956653002802975653000803003653000903011653000803020653000803028653000803036653000803044653001003052653001003062653001103072653000903083653001103092653000803103653000803111653001003119653001103129653001103140653001003151653001003161653001103171653001203182653001003194653000703204653000703211700001603218700001603234700002003250700001703270700001503287700001403302700001603316700001703332700001603349700001503365773009303380856008503473852000903558655001203567IND60730751120221122092014.0210415e202105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073075112DNAL7 a10.1016/j.phymed.2021.1535442doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHan, Ruiting10aSi Miao Formula attenuates non-alcoholic fatty liver disease by modulating hepatic lipid metabolism and gut microbiota  aNAL-light  aNon-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a chronic liver disease with few therapeutic options available currently. Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) has been practiced for thousands of years in China and Asian countries, and regarded as an important source for identifying novel medicines for diseases. Si Miao Formula (SMF) is a classical TCM formula for the treatment of gout disease by reducing serum uric acid concentrations, while high concentration of uric acid is also an independent risk factor for NAFLD.To investigate the protective effect of SMF on NAFLD in a mouse model induced by a high fat/high sucrose (HFHS) diet.Mice received a HFHS diet over a 16-week period to induce NAFLD with or without SMF intervention. Lipid levels were measured in both the liver and serum. Histopathological staining was used to evaluate the extent of hepatic lipid accumulation. Liver transcriptomics was used to enrich differentially expressed genes and to predict regulatory pathways after gene set enrichment analysis. 16S rRNA gene sequencing was used to determine the microbial composition. Genes of liver lipid metabolism, inflammation and intestinal tight junctions were detected by qRT-PCR analysis.SMF attenuated hepatic steatosis, reduced body weight gain and lipid concentrations, improved sensitivity to insulin and also tolerance to glucose, in mice fed an HFHS diet. Hepatic transcriptomics showed that SMF downregulated the biosynthesis of fatty acids and stimulated the insulin secretion pathway. SMF significantly altered the gut microbiota composition and in particular increased the proportion of Akkermansia muciniphila. In agreement with liver transcriptomics, SMF downregulated the expression of genes implicated in the metabolism of lipids (Acly, Fas, Acc, Scd-1) and pro-inflammatory cytokines (Il-1β, Nlrp-3) in the livers.The results indicate that SMF attenuates HFHS diet-induced NAFLD and regulates hepatic lipid metabolism pathways. The anti-NAFLD effect of SMF was linked to modulation of the gut microbiota composition and in particular an increased relative abundance of Akkermansia muciniphila.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOriental traditional medicine 3abiosynthesis 3ablood serum 3abody weight changes 3adiet 3afatty liver 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3aglucose 3agout 3ahistopathology 3ainflammation 3ainsulin 3ainsulin secretion 3aintestinal microorganisms 3aintestines 3alipid metabolism 3aliver 3amice 3aprotective effect 3arisk factors 3asucrose 3atherapeutics 3atranscriptomics 3auric acid 3aChina 0aSMF 0anon-alcoholic fatty liver disease 0agut microbiota 0aAkkermansia muciniphila 0aAcc 0aAcly 0aAco 0aALT 0aAST 0aAUC 0aCd-36 0aCpt-1 0aDgat-2 0aeWAT 0aFabp-1 0aFas 0aH&E 0aHDL-c 0aIl-1α 0aIl-1β 0aLDL-c 0aMcp-1 0aNlrp-3 0aPpar-α 0aScd-1 0aTC 0aTG1 aQiu, Huihui1 aZhong, Jing1 aZheng, Ningning1 aLi, Bingbing1 aHong, Ying1 aMa, Junli1 aWu, Gaosong1 aChen, Linlin1 aSheng, Lili1 aLi, Houkai0 tPhytomedicine.g2021 May, v. 85 p.153544-dElsevier GmbHwJournal:12402x0944-71137nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.phymed.2021.1535443Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03541naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006600148245013100214300001600345520153900361592002801900596007001928596009201998596008302090650002002173650001102193650001702204650001302221650001402234650001402248650001502262650001302277650001502290650001102305650001302316650001402329650001402343650001902357650000902376650001502385650002202400650002202422650002302444650002302467650001802490650001202508651001902520700002802539700004302567700002802610700003602638700003202674700003002706773011102736856008302847852000902930655001202939IND60692680920221122175124.0210915e202006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069268092DNAL7 a10.1007/s12237-020-00716-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSantos, Edjane Pereira1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4917-778210aSpatio-Temporal Changes in Basal Food Source Assimilation by Fish Assemblages in a Large Tropical Bay in the SW Atlantic Ocean  ap. 894-908.  aUnderstanding food pathways in estuarine communities is essential to improve our ability to cope with the increasing effects of man-made activities and climate variability on the biodiversity of coastal systems. Herein, we analyzed carbon and nitrogen isotope ratios of food web components in a large tropical bay in the southwestern Atlantic, in order to investigate spatial and temporal changes in the assimilation of basal food sources by fishes. Two hypotheses were evaluated: (i) continental-derived organic matter assimilation and isotopic niches of fish trophic guilds will increase during higher rainfall conditions and (ii) relative mangrove and macroalgae-derived nutrients assimilation will be directly proportional to their relative availability at each location. Our results did not corroborate our first hypothesis, while only partially corroborating the second one. As expected, macroalgae was one of the main assimilated basal food sources (especially by omnivore and zooplanktivore fishes) at the site where this primary producer was highly abundant. In contrast, only negligible amounts of mangrove-derived nutrients were assimilated by most trophic fish guilds at the site harboring an extensive mangrove area. Bayesian mixing models also revealed a substantial contribution of seagrass to herbivore and detritivore fishes. Some mechanisms like water divergence diminishing organic matter transport into the bay and the refractory characteristics of mangrove-derived detritus could partially explain these findings.  aPublisher supplied data  aPET0030/2012cFundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado da Bahia  a88882.31316871/2019-01cConselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico  a310141/2015-0cConselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico 3aBayesian theory 3acarbon 3adetritivores 3adetritus 3aestuaries 3afood webs 3aherbivores 3aisotopes 3amacroalgae 3aniches 3anitrogen 3anutrients 3aomnivores 3aorganic matter 3arain 3aseagrasses 3aspatial variation 3aspecies diversity 3astatistical models 3atemporal variation 3atropical fish 3atropics 3aAtlantic Ocean1 aCondini, Mario Vinicius1 aSantos, Alexandre Clistenes Alcântara1 aAlvarez, Heiddy Marquez1 ade Moraes, Leonardo Evangelista1 aGarcia, Adna Ferreira Silva1 aGarcia, Alexandre Miranda0 tEstuaries and coasts.g2020 June, v. 43, no. 4 p.894-908dSpringer USwJournal:jnl4000572x1559-27237nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12237-020-00716-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02332naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001800152245013100170300001600301520114500317592002801462650001501490650001601505650001501521650002001536650001401556650002601570650001701596651001301613653001301626653002301639653001801662653002101680653001601701653002601717773010701743856008701850852000901937655001201946IND60526376320221119172905.0190405e201604  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052637632DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jrurstud.2016.02.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPeou, Chivoin10aNegotiating rural-urban transformation and life course fluidity: Rural young people and urban sojourn in contemporary Cambodia  ap. 177-186.  aCambodia's politico-economic change in the 1990s has engendered profound rural-urban transformation and pressure on traditional peasant livelihoods. This article examines how rural young people cope with this societal change by migrating to work in the city, in the process renegotiating the life course and transforming rural life. Given rapid urbanisation and uneven growth, rural-urban labour migration has increasingly become a “normal” experience for young peasants entering working life. What is less clear is how these rural-urban migrant workers negotiate the emerging opportunity structures and mobility in the life course and what it means for rural life. Drawing on biographically oriented interviews with rural young people working in the capital of Phnom Penh, this article analyses their life experiences and meanings of urban sojourning to engage in labour work. This demonstrates how structural change and cultural scripts shape the life courses and perspectives of young peasants but also how they articulate their aspirations and agency in negotiating the changing terms of rural existence through a fluid life course.  aPublisher supplied data 3ainterviews 3alife events 3alivelihood 3amigrant workers 3apeasantry 3arural urban migration 3aurbanization 3aCambodia 0aCambodia 0aRural young people 0aUrban sojourn 0aLabour migration 0aLife course 0aSocial transformation0 tJournal of rural studies.g2016 Apr., v. 44 p.177-186dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl38039x0743-01677nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jrurstud.2016.02.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02329naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002300145245008300168300001600251520115700267592002801424650002401452650001801476650001101494650001801505650002501523650001401548650001101562650001601573650001201589650001001601650001601611650001501627650001301642650001201655650002201667651001301689700002501702773012301727856004801850852000901898655001201907IND4487801420221118002122.0120515e201206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448780142DNAL7 a10.1007/s10806-011-9306-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCardoso, Sarika P.10aEthical Frameworks and Farmer Participation in Controversial Farming Practices  ap. 377-404.  aThere are a number of agricultural farming practices that are controversial. These may include using chemical fertilizers, pesticides, and herbicides, and planting genetically modified crops, as well as the decision to dehorn cattle rather than raise polled cattle breeds. We use data from a survey of Missouri crop and livestock producers to determine whether a farmerâs ethical framework affects his or her decision to engage in these practices. We find that a plurality of farmers prefer an agricultural policy that reflects principles based on rights rather than principles of utilitarianism or justice. Furthermore, after controlling for personal and farm characteristics, we find a positive correlation between farmers preferring a rights-based policy and a farmerâs use of chemical farm inputs and polled rather than horned cattle. We also find that a combination of ethical framework and farm and farmer characteristics correlate with decisions to use farm chemicals, while only farm and farmer characteristics affect the decision to plant GM crops and only a farmerâs ethical framework affects the decision to use polled cattle.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural policy 3aagrochemicals 3acattle 3acattle breeds 3aconventional farming 3adehorning 3aethics 3afarm inputs 3afarmers 3afarms 3afertilizers 3aherbicides 3aplanting 3asurveys 3atransgenic plants 3aMissouri1 aJames Jr., Harvey S.0 tJournal of agricultural and environmental ethics.g2012 June, v. 25, no. 3 p.377-404dSpringer-Verlagx1187-78637nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10806-011-9306-6  aDNAL 7aarticle03081naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094024002200132024001900154040001800173100003000191245007600221300001600297506007600313520140200389592002801791506003701819650000801856650002401864650001901888650003001907650001501937650001301952650001601965650001801981650002601999650002602025650001302051650001302064650003302077650001602110650001602126650002002142653001502162653002402177653001402201653001502215653002302230700002602253700002002279700002502299700001702324773008102341856008402422852000902506655001202515IND60546707220221207093829.0160903e201403  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054670722DNAL7 a10.1016/j.wasman.2013.12.0092doi7 aPMC39695912pmcid7 a244567682pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFranke-Whittle, Ingrid H.10aChanges in the microbial communities during co-composting of digestates  ap. 632-641.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aAnaerobic digestion is a waste treatment method which is of increasing interest worldwide. At the end of the process, a digestate remains, which can gain added value by being composted. A study was conducted in order to investigate microbial community dynamics during the composting process of a mixture of anaerobic digestate (derived from the anaerobic digestion of municipal food waste), green wastes and a screened compost (green waste/kitchen waste compost), using the COMPOCHIP microarray. The composting process showed a typical temperature development, and the highest degradation rates occurred during the first 14days of composting, as seen from the elevated CO2 content in the exhaust air. With an exception of elevated nitrite and nitrate levels in the day 34 samples, physical–chemical parameters for all compost samples collected during the 63day process indicated typical composting conditions. The microbial communities changed over the 63days of composting. According to principal component analysis of the COMPOCHIP microarray results, compost samples from the start of the experiment were found to cluster most closely with the digestate and screened compost samples. The green waste samples were found to group separately. All starting materials investigated were found to yield fewer and lower signals when compared to the samples collected during the composting experiment.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aair 3aanaerobic digestion 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbon dioxide enrichment 3acomposting 3acomposts 3agreen waste 3akitchen waste 3amicroarray technology 3amicrobial communities 3anitrates 3anitrites 3aprincipal component analysis 3atemperature 3avalue added 3awaste treatment 0aComposting 0aAnaerobic digestion 0aCOMPOCHIP 0aMicroarray 0aNitrogen compounds1 aConfalonieri, Alberto1 aInsam, Heribert1 aSchlegelmilch, Mirko1 aKörner, Ina0 tWaste management.g2014 Mar., v. 34 p.632-641dElsevier Ltdx0956-053X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2013.12.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03144naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245015300166300001600319520176600335592002802101650001802129650001102147650002702158650002002185650001402205650001602219650001202235650002302247650001802270650001302288650001102301650001702312650001902329650002502348653002802373653002502401653001602426653002502442653001702467700001302484773009502497856008502592852000902677655001202686IND60592449220221119111023.0200712e201804  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059244922DNAL7 a10.1016/j.wasman.2017.12.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAkizuki, S.13aAn anaerobic-aerobic sequential batch process with simultaneous methanogenesis and short-cut denitrification for the treatment of marine biofoulings  ap. 168-176.  aAlthough combination of denitritation and methanogenesis for wastewater treatment has been widely investigated, an application of this technology to solid waste treatment has been rarely studied. This study investigated an anaerobic-aerobic batch system with simultaneous denitritation-methanogenesis as an effective treatment for marine biofoulings, which is a major source of intermittently discharged organic solid wastes. Preliminary NO₂⁻-exposed sludge was inoculated to achieve stable methanogenesis process without NO₂⁻ inhibition. Both high NH₄⁺-N removal of 99.5% and high NO₂⁻-N accumulation of 96.4% were achieved on average during the nitritation step. Sufficient CH₄ recovery of 101 L-CH₄ kg-COD⁻¹ was achieved, indicating that the use of NO₂⁻-exposed sludge is effective to avoid NO₂⁻ inhibition on methanogenesis. Methanogenesis was the main COD utilization pathway when the substrate solubilization occurred actively, while denitritation was the main when solubilization was limited because of substrate shortage. The results showed a high COD removal efficiency of 96.0% and a relatively low nitrogen removal efficiency of 64.4%. Fitting equations were developed to optimize the effluent exchange ratio. The estimated results showed that the increase of effluent exchange ratio during the active solubilization period increased the nitrogen removal efficiency but decreased CH₄ content in biogas. An appropriate effluent exchange ratio with high anaerobic effluent quality below approximately 120 mg-N L⁻¹ as well as sufficient CH₄ gas quality which can be used as fuel for gas engine generator was achieved by daily effluent exchange of 80% during the first week and 5% during the subsequent 8 days.  aPublisher supplied data 3abatch systems 3abiogas 3achemical oxygen demand 3adenitrification 3aequations 3agas engines 3amethane 3amethane production 3anitrification 3anitrogen 3asludge 3asolid wastes 3asolubilization 3awastewater treatment 0aMultifunctional reactor 0aSimultaneous process 0aNitritation 0aOrganic solid wastes 0aOptimization1 aToda, T.0 tWaste management.g2018 Apr., v. 74 p.168-176dElsevier LtdwJournal:6325x0956-053X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2017.12.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02529naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245008200168300001600250520143800266592002801704650001301732650000801745650001301753650001101766650001401777650001201791650001101803650001101814650001101825651001001836653002201846653003101868653002001899653002301919700001501942773008101957856008402038852000902122655001202131IND60546707420221119211408.0160903e201403  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054670742DNAL7 a10.1016/j.wasman.2013.12.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRaga, Roberto10aLandfill aeration in the framework of a reclamation project in Northern Italy  ap. 683-691.  aIn situ aeration by means of the Airflow technology was proposed for landfill conditioning before landfill mining in the framework of a reclamation project in Northern Italy. A 1-year aeration project was carried out on part of the landfill with the objective of evaluating the effectiveness of the Airflow technology for landfill aerobization, the evolution of waste biological stability during aeration and the effects on leachate and biogas quality and emissions.The main outcomes of the 1-year aeration project are presented in the paper.The beneficial effect of the aeration on waste biological stability was clear (63% reduction of the respiration index); however, the effectiveness of aeration on the lower part of the landfill is questionable, due to the limited potential for air migration into the leachate saturated layers.During the 1-year in situ aeration project approx. 275 MgC were discharged from the landfill body with the extracted gas, corresponding to 4.6gC/kgDM. However, due to the presence of anaerobic niches in the aerated landfill, approx. 46% of this amount was extracted as CH4, which is higher than reported in other aeration projects. The O2 conversion quota was lower than reported in other similar projects, mainly due to the higher air flow rates applied.The results obtained enabled valuable recommendations to be made for the subsequent application of the Airflow technology to the whole landfill.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaeration 3aair 3aair flow 3abiogas 3alandfills 3amethane 3amining 3aniches 3aoxygen 3aItaly 0aLandfill aeration 0aWaste biological stability 0aLandfill mining 0aLandfill emissions1 aCossu, R.,0 tWaste management.g2014 Mar., v. 34 p.683-691dElsevier Ltdx0956-053X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2013.12.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02358naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100003400150245006800184300001600252520097900268592002801247650002101275650003101296650001401327650000901341650002401350650001701374650002401391650001601415650001601431650001701447650001801464650001301482653001401495653001801509653001001527653001401537653002401551700001901575700002001594700001801614700002401632773013801656856008501794852000901879655001201888IND50072553120221119064623.0190318e20140215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007255312DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vetimm.2013.11.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChannabasappa, Shankaramurthy10aRetinoic acid induces apoptosis in activated canine neutrophils  ap. 175-181.  aActivated neutrophils live longer, produce toxic metabolites and cause considerable tissue injury, which is central to the pathogenesis of many inflammatory conditions. Retinoids are a class of lipophilic compounds with anti-inflammatory effects. We examined the effect of retinoic acid on apoptosis in normal and activated neutrophils. Our results showed that treatment with 1μg/ml Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide (LPS) for 12 and 36h delayed the spontaneous neutrophil apoptosis compared to untreated cells. But exposure of LPS-treated cells to retinoic acid (1 and 5μM) abolished the inhibitory effects of LPS on neutrophil apoptosis in a concentration-dependant manner based on annexin V staining, Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay, light and electron microscopy.

To help the efficient use and conservation of this species, the genetic diversity of C. asiatica populations in China was investigated using inter-simple sequence repeat (ISSR) markers. Fourteen natural populations comprising 162 individuals were included to estimate genetic diversity. At the species level, genetic diversity was relatively high (P = 66.33%, H = 0.2183, I = 0.3305). At the population level, the genetic diversity of JH (Jinhua, Zhejiang Province, China) and JJ (Jiujiang, Jiangxi Province, China) populations was relatively high (P = 43.88%, 38.78%, H = 0.1610, 0.1301, I = 0.2376, 0.1957, respectively), whereas the genetic diversity of GA (Guang’an, Sichuan Province, China) and EM (E’mei, Sichuan Province, China) was relatively low (P = 10.2%, 5.1%, H = 0.0383, 0.0211, I = 0.0570, 0.0309, respectively). On the basis of Nei’s G st value, more genetic differentiation among populations was determined (G st = 0.6573). In addition, the 14 populations were clustered into four groups in view of abundant ISSR data, which further defined the genetic relationship among populations. Interestingly, the genetic clustering result was similar to previous chemical clustering results based on high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) data, which would also classify the 14 populations into four groups. Thus, we combined the clustering results and compared their difference. The combined analysis and genetic diversity data provide a scientific basis for conserving populations of relatively high genetic diversity such as JH and JJ populations and establishing good agricultural practices (GAP) for C. asiatica.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCentella asiatica 3aOriental traditional medicine 3agenetic relationships 3agenetic techniques and protocols 3agenetic variation 3agood agricultural practices 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3amicrosatellite repeats 2aCentellaxchemistryxgenetics. 2aChromatography, High Pressure Liquid 2aCluster Analysis 2aConservation of Natural Resources 2aDNA Fingerprinting 2aGenes, Plant 2aGenetic Markers 2aGenetic Variation 2aMicrosatellite Repeats 2aPlants, Medicinal 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 3aChina 0aChina1 aHan, Ting1 aHe, Zhi-Gao1 aZhang, Qiao-Yan1 aZhang, Lei1 aRahman, Khalid1 aQin, Lu-Ping0 tNatural medicines.g2012 Jan., v. 66, no. 1 p.241-247dSpringer-Verlagx1340-34437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11418-011-0572-4  aDNAL 7aarticle02562naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001300150245013900163300001600302520122200318592002801540650002401568650002401592650001101616650002701627650001501654650001201669650001601681650002001697653005801717653001501775653001701790653002001807653001101827700006101838700001601899700002001915700001601935773009501951856008502046852000902131655001202140IND60592449420221119111142.0200712e201804  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059244942DNAL7 a10.1016/j.wasman.2017.12.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHu, Yong10aEffect of temperature and organic loading rate on siphon-driven self-agitated anaerobic digestion performance for food waste treatment  ap. 150-157.  aThe effects of organic loading rate (OLR) and operating temperature on the performance of siphon-driven self-agitated anaerobic reactor (SDSAR) in an on-site food waste (FW) treatment system were investigated. Two reactors were operated in parallel for comparison between mesophilic condition (35 ± 1 °C) and thermophilic condition (55 ± 1 °C). With HRT above 15 d and OLR below 4.8 kg-COD/m³/d, relatively high COD removal in the range of 84.5–92.3% was obtained in both reactors. The limits of the loading capacity of the mesophilic SDSAR were observed when OLR was further increased to 7.3 kg-COD/m³/d by shortening HRT. Blocking and gas production reduction occurred and COD removal decreased sharply to 75.9% in the mesophilic reactor. In contrast, the thermophilic reactor can be operated at this OLR with satisfactory COD removal and biogas production. Furthermore, at OLR of 14.4 kg-COD/m³/d, the COD removal was maintained as high as 87.5% in the thermophilic reactor. The conversion of influent COD to methane was maintained above 80% at all the OLR applied in both reactors. The results of this study indicated that thermophilic SDSAR is preferred for the on-site FW treatment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanaerobic digesters 3aanaerobic digestion 3abiogas 3achemical oxygen demand 3afood waste 3amethane 3atemperature 3awaste treatment 0aSiphon-driven self-agitated anaerobic reactor (SDSAR) 0aMesophilic 0aThermophilic 0aFood waste (FW) 0aBiogas1 aKobayashi, Takuro1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0005-31561 aQi, Weikang1 aOshibe, Hiroshi1 aXu, Kai-Qin0 tWaste management.g2018 Apr., v. 74 p.150-157dElsevier LtdwJournal:6325x0956-053X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2017.12.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02260naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005400150245005500204520116300259592002801422650002001450650001501470650002401485650001101509650001301520650001601533650001701549650002001566650001601586650001101602650001001613700006001623773013301683856008501816852000901901655001201910IND60753814220221122054011.0211213e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075381422DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biocel.2021.1060972doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDow, Reece1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4706-075910aNeutrophil microvesicles and their role in disease  aMicrovesicles are formed through shedding from the plasma membrane, a process shared by almost all human cells. Microvesicles are highly abundant and have been detected in blood, urine, cerebrospinal fluid, and saliva. They contain a library of cargo derived from their parental cell during formation, including proteases, micro-RNAs and lipids and delivery of this parental cell-derived cargo to other cells can alter target cell function and drive disease. Cell specific molecules on the surface of microvesicles, obtained during microvesicle formation, allows their parental cell to be identified and populations of microvesicles to be investigated for roles in the pathogenesis of various diseases. For instance, recent work by our group has identified a role for neutrophil microvesicles in atherosclerosis. Microvesicle profiles could in future be associated with certain diseases and act as a biomarker to allow for earlier diagnosis. This short review will discuss some of the processes central to all microvesicles before focusing on neutrophil microvesicles, their potential role in cardiovascular disease and the mechanisms that may underpin this.  aPublisher supplied data 3aatherosclerosis 3abiomarkers 3acerebrospinal fluid 3ahumans 3amicroRNA 3aneutrophils 3apathogenesis 3aplasma membrane 3aproteinases 3asaliva 3aurine1 aRidger, Victoria1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4163-669X0 tinternational journal of biochemistry & cell biology.g2021 Dec., v. 141 p.106097-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12452x1357-27257nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biocel.2021.1060973Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02053naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245011000172300001800282520078800300592002801088650001301116650000901129650001401138650002101152650001401173650001001187650001101197650001001208651001401218653001401232653002701246653001301273653000901286653003001295653001501325653002201340653002701362700001901389700002301408773008301431856008401514852000901598655001201607IND60546707620221119211356.0160903e201410  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054670762DNAL7 a10.1016/j.wasman.2013.12.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMauthoor, Sumayya13aAn assessment on the recycling opportunities of wastes emanating from scrap metal processing in Mauritius  ap. 1800-1805.  aThis paper presents an assessment on the wastes namely slag, dust, mill scale and sludge resulting from scrap metal processing.

These wastes are briefly described and an overview on the different areas of applications is presented. Based on the results obtained, the waste generation factor developed was 349.3kg per ton of steel produced and it was reported that slag represents 72% of the total wastes emanating from the iron and steel industry in Mauritius. Finally the suitability of the different treatment and valorisation options in the context of Mauritius is examined.  aPublisher supplied data 3aindustry 3airon 3alandfills 3aprocessing waste 3arecycling 3aslags 3asludge 3asteel 3aMauritius 0aRecycling 0aScrap metal processing 0aLandfill 0aSlag 0aElectric arc furnace dust 0aMill scale 0aWastewater sludge 0aWaste management model1 aMohee, Romeela1 aKowlesser, Prakash0 tWaste management.g2014 Oct., v. 34 p.1800-1805dElsevier Ltdx0956-053X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2013.12.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02230naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001100147245006000158300001200218520103600230592002801266596004101294650001701335650002201352650002301374650002501397650002901422650001901451650001101470650001901481650002901500700005301529700001901582700001301601773015101614856008201765852000901847655001201856IND60632508320221123003818.0200903e201904  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063250832DNAL7 a10.1007/s10661-019-7365-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Di12aA review on drone-based harmful algae blooms monitoring  ap. 211.  aRapid development and applications of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) provide promising solutions to and new opportunities for environmental monitoring. Owing to their flexibility in flight scheduling, high spatial resolution, and costs-effectiveness, UAVs have become a popular tool for monitoring dynamic environmental processes, such as emergence and outbreak of harmful algae blooms (HABs). The HABs outbreak, often linked with anthropogenic eutrophication, has become a serious environmental health problem that threats our communities. Existing studies show that UAV-based HABs monitoring is a cost-effective means of assisting environmental managers in developing precautionary warning system and coping strategies. This article summarized the state-of-the-art of using UAVs and lightweight onboard multispectral sensors for HABs monitoring from the perspective of quantitative remote sensing. It culminates in a discussion of challenges and opportunities for future research and applications on drone-based HABs monitoring.  aPublisher supplied data  an/acIllinois Water Resources Center 3aalgal blooms 3acoping strategies 3acost effectiveness 3aenvironmental health 3aenvironmental monitoring 3aeutrophication 3aflight 3aremote sensing 3aunmanned aerial vehicles1 aLi, Ruopu1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3500-02731 aZhang, Feiyang1 aLiu, Jia0 tEnvironmental monitoring and assessment.g2019 Apr., v. 191, no. 4 p.211-211dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl33242x0167-63697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-019-7365-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03624naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001400148245008200162300001600244520217400260592002802434650002002462650002002482650001402502650000902516650001302525650001502538650001202553650001002565650001402575650001502589650002202604650002302626650001602649650001602665650000902681650001102690651001902701651001702720651001502737700005302752700001902805700002102824700002502845700001402870700001902884773011102903856008303014852000903097655001203106IND60692681420221122153950.0210915e202006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069268142DNAL7 a10.1007/s12237-019-00670-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhu, Ling10aField Observations of Wind Waves in Upper Delaware Bay with Living Shorelines  ap. 739-755.  aConstructed oyster reefs (CORs) provide shore protections and habitats for fish and shellfish communities via wave energy attenuation. However, the processes and mechanism of CORs on wave attenuation remain unclear, thus limiting the effective assessment of CORs for shoreline protection. This paper presents results of a field investigation on wave characteristics and wave spectral variations along a shoreline with CORs in an estuary with a large tidal range as well as large wind waves and swell energy. Six pressure transducers were deployed from January 31 to April 2, 2018, in Gandy’s Beach, New Jersey, in upper Delaware Bay. CORs were constructed at the study site in 2016 as living shoreline structures after Hurricane Sandy. The data collected from the study site exhibits the wave variations and spectral characteristics over the span of 2 months, including four winter storms (i.e., nor’easters). The spatial variations of wave heights measured on both sides of CORs show a strong dependence on the ratio between the freeboard of CORs and the offshore wave heights. Due to the large tidal range (> 2 m), the crests of CORs remain submerged over 85% of the time. The submerged CORs only provide partial attenuation of wave energy. The wave environment in the estuary is complex, especially during nor’easters. For instance, winds with rapid changing fetches could lead to bi-modal wind seas. Due to the complex wave spectra, the bulk wave heights such as the significant wave heights cannot be adopted to adequately reveal the capacity of CORs to attenuate wave energy. Spectral analysis is conducted to investigate the spatial and temporal variations of wave energy in targeted frequency bins. The spectral analysis results reveal the energy transfer from the primary waves to the high harmonics after waves propagate over the submerged CORs. Moreover, it is found that swell energy originated from the Atlantic Ocean can penetrate CORs without any dampening even when CORs are emergent. This study could help resource managers for in-depth evaluation of living shoreline effectiveness and improvement of living shoreline structures such as CORs.  aPublisher supplied data 3adata collection 3aenergy transfer 3aestuaries 3afish 3ahabitats 3ahurricanes 3aoysters 3areefs 3ashellfish 3ashorelines 3aspectral analysis 3atemporal variation 3awater power 3awater waves 3awind 3awinter 3aAtlantic Ocean 3aDelaware Bay 3aNew Jersey1 aChen, Qin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6540-87581 aWang, Hongqing1 aCapurso, William1 aNiemoczynski, Lukasz1 aHu, Kelin1 aSnedden, Gregg0 tEstuaries and coasts.g2020 June, v. 43, no. 4 p.739-755dSpringer USwJournal:jnl4000572x1559-27237nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12237-019-00670-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03451naa a2200661 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002200139245010800161300001600269500002000285520152800305592002801833650001601861650001901877650002601896650001401922650001401936650002001950650002201970650001401992650001502006650001602021651001102037700001502048700002102063700002002084700002202104700001802126700002202144700002202166700002102188700001602209700002202225700002202247700001902269700001702288700001702305700002002322700002402342700002002366700002002386700002002406700002402426700002002450700001902470700001902489700002202508700002202530700001902552773012402571856007302695852000902768655001202777IND60520339820221119191202.0160519e201607  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052033982DNAL7 a10.1111/bij.127452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLemoine, Mélissa10aLow but contrasting neutral genetic differentiation shaped by winter temperature in European great tits  ap. 668-685.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aGene flow is usually thought to reduce genetic divergence and impede local adaptation by homogenising gene pools between populations. However, evidence for local adaptation and phenotypic differentiation in highly mobile species, experiencing high levels of gene flow, is emerging. Assessing population genetic structure at different spatial scales is thus a crucial step towards understanding mechanisms underlying intraspecific differentiation and diversification. Here, we studied the population genetic structure of a highly mobile species – the great tit Parus major – at different spatial scales. We analysed 884 individuals from 30 sites across Europe including 10 close‐by sites (< 50 km), using 22 microsatellite markers. Overall we found a low but significant genetic differentiation among sites (FST = 0.008). Genetic differentiation was higher, and genetic diversity lower, in south‐western Europe. These regional differences were statistically best explained by winter temperature. Overall, our results suggest that great tits form a single patchy metapopulation across Europe, in which genetic differentiation is independent of geographical distance and gene flow may be regulated by environmental factors via movements related to winter severity. This might have important implications for the evolutionary trajectories of sub‐populations, especially in the context of climate change, and calls for future investigations of local differences in costs and benefits of philopatry at large scales.  aPublisher supplied data 3aParus major 3aclimate change 3aenvironmental factors 3agene flow 3agene pool 3agenetic markers 3agenetic variation 3aphenotype 3aphilopatry 3atemperature 3aEurope1 aLucek, Kay1 aPerrier, Charles1 aSaladin, Verena1 aAdriaensen, Frank1 aBarba, Emilio1 aBelda, Eduardo J.1 aCharmantier, Anne1 aCichoń, Mariusz1 aEeva, Tapio1 aGrégoire, Arnaud1 aHinde, Camilla A.1 aJohnsen, Arild1 aKomdeur, J.,1 aMänd, Raivo1 aMatthysen, Erik1 aNorte, Ana Cláudia1 aPitala, Natalia1 aSheldon, Ben C.1 aSlagsvold, Tore1 aTinbergen, Joost M.1 aTörök, János1 aUbels, Richard1 avan Oers, Kees1 aVisser, Marcel E.1 aDoligez, Blandine1 aRichner, Heinz0 tBiological journal of the Linnean Society.g2016 July, v. 118, no. 3 p.668-685dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx0024-40667nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/bij.127453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03151naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002200148245011300170300001800283520173200301592002802033650001502061650001202076650001002088650002102098650001002119650001202129650001302141650001502154650001102169650002202180650000902202700006602211700002202277700002202299700002702321700002702348700002502375700002202400700006702422773012402489856008302613852000902696655001202705IND60768101120221116231705.0220225e202203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076810112DNAL7 a10.1007/s11033-021-06994-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSahaba, Shaid All14aThe link of ERCC2 rs13181 and ERCC4 rs2276466 polymorphisms with breast cancer in the Bangladeshi population  ap. 1847-1856.  aBACKGROUND: Breast cancer (BC) is the most common disease in women and the leading cause of death from cancer globally. Epidemiological studies examined that nucleotide excision repair genes ERCC2 (rs13181) and ERCC4 (rs2276466) SNPs might increase cancer risk. Based on the previous investigation, this study was conducted to explore the correlation between these polymorphisms and BC susceptibility in Bangladeshi women. METHODS AND RESULTS: Between January 2019 and January 2020, 140 blood samples were collected from female patients histologically diagnosed with BC, and 111 female controls were recruited from non-cancer subjects. Genotyping was performed applying the PCR–RFLP method, and all statistical analyzes were conducted using SPSS, version 25.0. Comparison of characteristics and clinicopathological features between ERCC2 rs13181 and ERCC4 rs2276466 carriers and non-carriers showed no significant link with BC. Analysis of ERCC2 rs13181 with the risk of BC showed that the GG genotype and G allele carriers showed a fourfold and 1.78-fold higher risk (OR 4.00, P = 0.001 and OR 1.78, P = 0.002) that are statistically significant. In addition, the patients with combined TG+GG genotype revealed a 2.09-fold increased chance (OR 2.09, P = 0.020) BC development. Analysis of recessive model (GG vs. TT+TG) also depicted 2.74-times significantly higher risk (OR 2.74, P = 0.002). On the other hand, ERCC4 rs2276466 polymorphism did not show any significant association with BC (P > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings show that ERCC2 rs13181 is linked to an elevated risk of BC. Our study also shows that ERCC4 rs2276466 polymorphism has no substantial risk of BC in the Bangladeshi population.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA repair 3aalleles 3ablood 3abreast neoplasms 3adeath 3afemales 3agenotype 3agenotyping 3amodels 3amolecular biology 3arisk1 aRashid, Mohammad Abdur1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1464-71151 aIslam, Md.

Such conflict is pervasive in the Karoo region of South Africa but its contemporary history and various causes remain poorly understood. In this study, we interviewed 77 small-livestock farmers in the Central Karoo between July 2014 and March 2015 to (1) assess the spatio-temporal distribution and severity of the reported predation problems with the main regional predators of livestock (black-backed jackal, caracal and baboon) and (2) describe the perceived reasons for changes in predator numbers. Farmers reported that serious predation problems have increased since the 1990s for all three predators. Jackal predation appears to have re-emerged, particularly since the 2000s, while baboon predation seems to have escalated rapidly since 2014 for select farmers. Farms with more rugged terrain were more likely to experience serious problems with baboons and caracal but ruggedness did not predict the year of onset of problems. Farmers perceive predator numbers to be increasing and attribute this trend to declining government support for predator management, changes in farming practices and the associated increase in suitable predator habitat, from which they can recolonise commercial farms.  aPublisher supplied data  aGT 2251cWorld Wildlife Fund-Nedbank Green Trust  cHarry Crossley Foundation Postdoctoral Fellowship  cNRF  cUniversity of Cape Towndhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100007112 3aCanis mesomelas 3aCaracal 3aPapio 3acommercial farms 3afarmers 3afarming systems 3ahabitats 3ajackals 3alandscapes 3alivelihood 3alivestock 3apredation 3apredator control 3apredators 3aspatial distribution 3awildlife 3aSouth Africa 0ablack-backed jackal 0acaracal 0achacma baboon 0aquestionnaire 0arangelands1 aTafani, Marion1 aNattrass, Nicoli1 aO’Riain, Justin0 tAfrican journal of range & forage science.g2018 Dec. 10, v. 35, no. 3-4 p.245-255dTaylor & FranciswJournal:J000000042x1727-93807nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2989/10220119.2018.15226693Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02363naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001900149245006900168520115800237592002801395650001101423650001101434650002401445650001601469650001401485650001001499650001101509650002101520650000901541650002001550650001301570650001001583653002501593653001601618653001601634653001701650653003401667653002101701773012601722856008401848852000901932655001201941IND60753814420221122054006.0211227e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075381442DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cocis.2021.1015242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZeeb, Benjamin10aInteraction between components of plant-based biopolymer systems  aProteins and polysaccharides are key elements in formulated foods, cosmetics, and pharmaceuticals. Their interaction behavior mainly determines the organoleptic, optical, textural, and rheological properties of foods. Traditionally, animal-based biopolymers have been widely used because of their excellent techno-functionality; however, plant-based alternatives gained enormous interest among scientists and manufacturers because of sustainable, religious, ethical, and nutritional reasons. The directed complexation of mixed biopolymers entirely originated from plants might be used to stabilize food colloids, modulate interfacial and bulk properties, control the release of bioactives, and mask bitter components. As such, this review highlights the general separation mechanism of mixed biopolymers systems entirely composed of plant-based biopolymers to be used as functional food ingredients. Particularly, ‘traditional’ and ‘novel’ proteins and polysaccharides obtained from different plant sources (e.g. soy, wheat, pea, potato, apple, citrus) are introduced to be assembled to modulate interfacial and bulk properties of food colloids.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCitrus 3aapples 3abioactive compounds 3abiopolymers 3acosmetics 3adrugs 3aethics 3afunctional foods 3apeas 3apolysaccharides 3apotatoes 3awheat 0aPlant-based proteins 0aAssociation 0aSegregation 0aCoacervation 0aThermodynamic incompatibility 0aPhase separation0 tCurrent opinion in colloid & interface science.g2021 Dec., v. 56 p.101524-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12032x1359-02947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cocis.2021.1015243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03055naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001400150245007900164300001800243520141200261592002801673650001501701650001701716650001501733650001101748650002901759650001101788650001801799650001601817650001101833650002701844650000701871650001501878650001401893650001901907650001901926650001601945650001601961650001101977650002701988653002602015653002102041653002802062653002302090653002502113653002702138700001502165700001702180700001302197700001702210700001402227700001402241700002202255773008302277856008402360852000902444655001202453IND60546707820221119211331.0160903e201411  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054670782DNAL7 a10.1016/j.wasman.2013.12.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRokia, S.10aModelling agronomic properties of Technosols constructed with urban wastes  ap. 2155-2162.  aThe greening of urban and suburban areas requires large amounts of arable earth that is a non-renewable resource. However, concentration of population in cities leads to the production of high amounts of wastes and by-products that are nowadays partly recycled as a resource and quite systematically exported out of urban areas. To preserve natural soil resources, a strategy of waste recycling as fertile substitutes is proposed. Eleven wastes are selected for their environmental harmlessness and their contrasted physico-chemical properties for their potential use in pedological engineering. The aim is (i) to demonstrate the feasibility of the formulation of fertile substrates exclusively with wastes and (ii) to model their physico-chemical properties following various types, number and proportions of constitutive wastes. Twenty-five binary and ternary combinations are tested at different ratios for total carbon, Olsen available phosphorus, cation exchange capacity, water pH, water retention capacity and bulk density. Dose–response curves describe the variation of physico-chemical properties of mixtures depending on the type and ratio of selected wastes. If these mixtures mainly mimic natural soils, some of them present more extreme urban soil features, especially for pH and POlsen. The fertility of the new substrates is modelled by multilinear regressions for the main soil properties.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTechnosols 3abulk density 3abyproducts 3acarbon 3acation exchange capacity 3acities 3adose response 3aengineering 3amodels 3anonrenewable resources 3apH 3aphosphorus 3arecycling 3asoil resources 3asuburban areas 3aurban areas 3aurban soils 3awastes 3awater holding capacity 0aConstructed Technosol 0aUrban vegetation 0aPedological engineering 0aWastes formulation 0aAgronomic properties 0aDose–response curves1 aSéré, G.1 aSchwartz, C.1 aDeeb, M.1 aFournier, F.1 aNehls, T.1 aDamas, O.1 aVidal-Beaudet, L.0 tWaste management.g2014 Nov., v. 34 p.2155-2162dElsevier Ltdx0956-053X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2013.12.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03322naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005700148245013600205300001600341520182700357592002802184596003702212650002002249650001102269650001402280650001902294650002102313650001202334650001102346650001402357650001302371650002002384650001602404650001402420650001402434650002502448650001102473650001702484650001902501651001302520700002602533700002202559700002302581700002102604773011102625856008302736852000902819655001202828IND60692681520221122153931.0210915e202006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069268152DNAL7 a10.1007/s12237-020-00700-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlldred, Mary1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9700-069610aMarsh Plants Enhance Coastal Marsh Resilience by Changing Sediment Oxygen and Sulfide Concentrations in an Urban, Eutrophic Estuary  ap. 801-813.  aDespite considerable efforts to restore coastal wetlands, the ecological mechanisms contributing to the success or failure of restoration are rarely assessed. Accumulation of hydrogen sulfide in sediments may accelerate rates of marsh loss in eutrophic estuaries and is likely driven by complex feedbacks between wetland plant growth and microbial redox reactions. We used a chronosequence of restored marshes in urbanized and eutrophic Jamaica Bay (New York City, USA) to assess how sediment redox conditions change among seasons and over the lifetime of restored marshes. We also compared a stable extant marsh to one that has deteriorated over the past 50 years. We collected seasonal sediment cores from each marsh, and used a motorized microprofiling system to measure the vertical distribution of oxygen and sulfide. We fit a logistic function to each profile to estimate (1) maximum concentrations, (2) rates of increase/decline, and (3) depths of maximum increase/decline. We quantified sediment density, porosity, organic content, and belowground plant biomass, and estimated differences in daily tidal inundation among sites using water-level loggers. We found that minimum oxygen and maximum sulfide concentrations occur during summer. Sulfide concentrations were highest in sites that experienced the longest daily tidal inundation, including the degraded extant marsh and the oldest restored marsh. Spatial patterns in oxygen and sulfide were related to belowground plant biomass, supporting our hypothesis that root growth increases sediment oxygen and partially alleviates sulfide stress. Our data support the growing body of evidence that belowground plant growth may enhance the resilience of marshes to sea-level rise by increasing marsh elevation and facilitating oxygen diffusion into marsh sediments.  aPublisher supplied data  a013-15AcHudson River Foundation 3achronosequences 3acoasts 3aestuaries 3aeutrophication 3ahydrogen sulfide 3amarshes 3aoxygen 3aphytomass 3aporosity 3aredox reactions 3aroot growth 3asea level 3asediments 3aspatial distribution 3asummer 3aurbanization 3awetland plants 3aNew York1 aBorrelli, Jonathan J.1 aHoellein, Timothy1 aBruesewitz, Denise1 aZarnoch, Chester0 tEstuaries and coasts.g2020 June, v. 43, no. 4 p.801-813dSpringer USwJournal:jnl4000572x1559-27237nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12237-020-00700-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02467naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100006100155245012200216520107200338592002801410650001501438650001501453650002001468650000901488650001501497650001601512650001401528650001301542650000701555650001901562650001701581650001601598653002301614653001701637653002001654653002301674653002501697700002401722700002201746700002501768773010401793856009001897961001301987852000902000655001202009IND60681447320221123004159.0200128e202005  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068144732DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2020.1258972doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEssandoh, Matthew1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3117-914110aPerformance and mechanism of polypeptidylated hemoglobin (Hb)/iron oxide magnetic composites for enhanced dye removal  aComposites of polypeptidylated hemoglobin supported on different iron oxide weights (0.5:1 and 1:1) were developed and demonstrated to function as efficient adsorbents for Eriochrome black-T dye removal. The synthesis of these adsorbents were performed through N-carboxyanhydride (NCA) polymerization at low temperature (4 °C) and near-neutral pH for 24 h followed by chemical co-precipitation. The synthesized adsorbents were found to exhibit BET surface area (54–87 m²/g), pore volume (0.30–0.35 cm³/g), average pore diameter (160–218 Å) and average pore width (136–171 Å). The developed adsorbents were tested in a batch dye adsorption system. Adsorption was found to follow pseudo-second order kinetics and the Langmuir adsorption capacities were 123, 204 and 217 mg/g for Fe₃O₄, 0.5:1 and 1:1 adsorbent samples, respectively. Chemical regeneration was successfully carried out using methanol and the reusability of the adsorbents were demonstrated with a decrease in adsorption capacities from ∼49 to ∼33 mg/g after the fourth reuse.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3acoprecipitation 3adyes 3ahemoglobin 3airon oxides 3amagnetism 3amethanol 3apH 3apolymerization 3asurface area 3atemperature 0aMagnetic adsorbent 0aRegeneration 0aDye remediation 0aEriochrome black-T 0aIron oxide composite1 aGarcía, Rafael A.,1 aGayle, Makahra R.1 aNieman, Christine M.0 tChemosphere.g2020 May, v. 247 p.125897-dElsevier LtdaElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2020.1258973Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle02845naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002300139245017800162300001600340500002000356520159800376592002801974650001502002650002202017650001502039650002102054650001802075650002202093650001602115650001402131650001902145650001702164650001202181650001002193650001202203700002602215773012402241856007302365852000902438655001202447IND60520340020221120101648.0160519e201607  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052034002DNAL7 a10.1111/bij.127672doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMartínez, Juan J.10aPhylogenetic relationships among species of the Neotropical genus Graomys (Rodentia: Cricetidae): contrasting patterns of skull morphometric variation and genetic divergence  ap. 648-667.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aSubtle differences of external traits characterize species of rodents in the Neotropical genus Graomys. On the other hand, the species differ markedly in chromosome number. In the present study, we evaluate the possible evolutionary forces involved in the evolution of the genus by assessing the degree of intra‐ and interspecific genetic and morphological variation. A phylogenetic analysis demonstrates the existence of at least three species with high levels of genetic distance (10%), which diverged between 1 and 1.5 Mya. Neither Graomys griseoflavus, nor Graomys chacoensis present marked phylogeographical structure. Regarding morphological characters, these species show shape differences in the skull that could be attributable to differences in the local conditions they inhabit, being more marked in G. griseoflavus than in G. chacoensis. The skull shape of G. chacoensis could have evolved under genetic drift, whereas evidence reported in the present study indicates that this character could be under selective pressures in G. griseoflavus. Reconstruction of the ancestral area suggests that G. griseoflavus originated in the central Monte desert, whereas G. chacoensis originated in the Chaco ecoregion surrounding the austral extreme of the Yungas rainforest. Subsequently, both species would have undergone demographic and geographical expansions almost simultaneously, starting approximately 150 000–175 000 years ago. The complex evolutionary history of the genus could be partly explained by the decoupling of morphological, karyological and molecular traits.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCricetidae 3achromosome number 3aecoregions 3agenetic distance 3agenetic drift 3agenetic variation 3amorphometry 3aphylogeny 3aphylogeography 3arain forests 3arodents 3askull 3atropics1 aGardenal, Cristina N.0 tBiological journal of the Linnean Society.g2016 July, v. 118, no. 3 p.648-667dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx0024-40667nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/bij.127673Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02755naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245012200170300001600292520129200308592002801600650002201628650003001650650002701680650002101707650002001728650002001748650001001768650002101778650003101799650003301830650001801863650001301881650001801894651002101912700002201933700001701955700001801972700001901990700001902009773012302028852000902151856008102160930003302241946001102274655001202285IND60439504020221119230643.0151024e200809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6043950402DNAL7 a10.1007/s10661-007-9989-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFilik Iscen, Cansu10aApplication of multivariate statistical techniques in the assessment of surface water quality in Uluabat Lake, Turkey  ap. 269-276.  aThe application of different multivariate statistical approaches for the interpretation of a complex data matrix obtained during the period 2004–2005 from Uluabat Lake surface water is presented in this study. The dataset consists of the analytical results of a 1 year-survey conducted in 12 sampling stations in the Lake. Twelve parameters (T, pH, DO, [Formula: see text], NH₄–N, NO₂–N, NO₃–N, [Formula: see text], BOD, COD, TC, FC) were monitored in the sampling sites on a monthly basis (except December 2004, January and February 2005, a total of 1,296 observations). The dataset was treated using cluster analysis, principle component analysis and factor analysis on principle components. Cluster analysis revealed two different groups of similarities between the sampling sites, reflecting different physicochemical properties and pollution levels in the studied water system. Three latent factors were identified as responsible for the data structure, explaining 77.35% of total variance in the dataset. The first factor called the microbiological factor explained 32.34% of the total variance. The second factor named the organic-nutrient factors explained 25.46% and the third factor called physicochemical factors explained 19.54% of the variances, respectively.  aPublisher supplied data 3aammonium nitrogen 3abiochemical oxygen demand 3achemical oxygen demand 3acluster analysis 3adata collection 3afactor analysis 3alakes 3anitrate nitrogen 3aphysicochemical properties 3aprincipal component analysis 3asurface water 3avariance 3awater quality 3aTurkey (country)1 aEmiroglu, Özgür1 aIlhan, Semra1 aArslan, Naime1 aYilmaz, Veysel1 aAhiska, Seyhan0 tEnvironmental monitoring and assessment.g2008 Sept., v. 144, no. 1-3 p.269-276dSpringer Netherlandsx0167-63697nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-007-9989-33Available from publisher's site  a20080808b20080905c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03609naa a2200625 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100002000171245016400191300001600355520163300371592002802004650002202032650000802054650001702062650002002079650001402099650001902113650001602132650002902148650001702177650001202194650001302206650001702219650002702236650002002263650001402283650001102297650001502308650001402323650002302337650004302360650002802403650003902431650004902470650003402519650004002553650003702593700002002630700002102650700002102671700002002692700002102712700002302733700002102756700002102777773010902798856005502907852000902962655001202971IND4468590620221120072500.0120727e201110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446859062DNAL7 a217263762pmid7 a10.1111/j.1364-3703.2011.00709.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSCHERM, BARBARA10aAltered trichothecene biosynthesis in TRI6‐silenced transformants of Fusarium culmorum influences the severity of crown and foot rot on durum wheat seedlings  ap. 759-771.  aAn RNA silencing construct was used to alter mycotoxin production in the plant pathogenic fungus Fusarium culmorum, the incitant of crown and foot rot on wheat. The transformation of a wild‐type strain and its nitrate reductase‐deficient mutant with inverted repeat transgenes (IRTs) containing sequences corresponding to the trichothecene regulatory gene TRI6 was achieved using hygromycin B resistance as a selectable marker. Southern analysis revealed a variety of integration patterns of the TRI6 IRT. One transformant underwent homologous recombination with deletion of the endogenous TRI6 gene, whereas, in another transformant, the TRI6 IRT was not integrated into the genome. The TRI6 IRT did not alter the physiological characteristics, such as spore production, pigmentation or growth rate, on solid media. In most transformants, a high TRI6 amplification signal was detected by quantitative reverse transcription‐polymerase chain reaction, corresponding to a TRI6‐hybridizing smear of degraded fragments by Northern analysis, whereas TRI5 expression decreased compared with the respective nontransformed strain. Four transformants showed increased TRI5 expression, which was correlated with a dramatic (up to 28‐fold) augmentation of deoxynivalenol production. Pathogenicity assays on durum wheat seedlings confirmed that impairment of deoxynivalenol production in the TRI6 IRT transformants correlated with a loss of virulence, with decreased disease indices ranging from 40% to 80% in nine silenced strains, whereas the overproducing transformants displayed higher virulence compared with the wild‐type.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFusarium culmorum 3aRNA 3abiosynthesis 3acrop production 3acrown rot 3adeoxynivalenol 3adurum wheat 3ahomologous recombination 3ahygromycin B 3amutants 3anitrates 3apigmentation 3aplant pathogenic fungi 3aregulator genes 3aseedlings 3aspores 3atransgenes 3avirulence 2aBlotting, Northern 2aFungal Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aFusariumxpathogenicity 2aGene Expression Regulation, Fungal 2aTranscription Factorsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aTrichothecenesxbiosynthesis. 2aTriticumxmetabolismxmicrobiology. 2aVirulencexgeneticsxphysiology.1 aORRÙ, MARCELLA1 aBALMAS, VIRGILIO1 aSPANU, FRANCESCA1 aAZARA, EMANUELA1 aDELOGU, GIOVANNA1 aHAMMOND, THOMAS M.1 aKELLER, NANCY P.1 aMIGHELI, QUIRICO0 tMolecular plant pathology.g2011 Oct., v. 12, no. 8 p.759-771dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx1464-67227nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1364-3703.2011.00709.x  aDNAL 7aarticle02476naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002100148245010000169300001600269520104100285592002801326650001501354650001301369650002001382650001701402650002101419650001601440650001601456650001701472650001901489650004401508650000701552650001701559650001301576653001501589653002301604653001401627653001601641700001501657700001801672700002001690700001701710700001801727700001901745700002001764773009501784856008201879852000901961655001201970IND60553360720221123013408.0161021e20140515xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055336072DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bios.2013.12.0472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Sheng-Qing10aNovel pyrazoline-based fluorescent probe for detecting glutathione and its application in cells  ap. 386-390.  aA novel compound, 2-(1,5-diphenyl-4,5-dihydro-1H-pyrazol-3-yl)phenyl acrylate (probe L), was designed and synthesized as a highly sensitive and selective fluorescent probe for recognizing and detecting glutathione among cysteine, homocysteine and other amino acids. The structures of related compounds were characterized using IR, NMR and HRMS spectroscopy analysis. The probe is a non-fluorescent compound. On being mixed with glutathione in buffered EtOH:PBS=3:7 solution at pH 7.4, the probe exhibited the blue emission of the pyrazoline at 474nm and a 83-fold enhancement in fluorescence intensity. This probe is very sensitive and displayed a linear fluorescence off–on response to glutathione with fluorometric detection limit of 8.2×10−8M. The emission of the probe is pH independent in the physiological pH range. Live-cell imaging of HeLa cells confirmed the cell permeability of the probe and its ability to selectively discriminate GSH from Cys and Hcy in cells. The toxicity of the probe was low in cultured HeLa cells.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiosensors 3acysteine 3adetection limit 3afluorescence 3afluorescent dyes 3afluorometry 3aglutathione 3ahomocysteine 3aimage analysis 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3apH 3apermeability 3atoxicity 0aPyrazoline 0aFluorescent sensor 0aSelective 0aGlutathione1 aWu, Q.

In this research, the aluminothermic self-propagating high-temperature synthesis (SHS) was used for recovering the transition metals of BR for the first time. The effects of extra aluminum as reducing agent and flux to aluminum ratio (CaO/Al) were studied and the efficiency of recovery and presence of impurities were measured. Aluminothermic reduction of vanadium and other metals was carried out successfully by SHS without any foreign heat source. Vanadium, iron, and nickel principally were reduced and gone into metallic master alloy as SHS product. High levels of efficiency (>80%) were achieved and the results showed that SHS has a great potential to be an industrial process for BR recovery. SHS produced two useful products. Metallic master alloy and fused glass slag that is applicable for ceramic industries. SHS can also neutralize the environmental threats of BR by a one step process.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalloys 3aaluminum 3acalcium oxide 3aceramics 3acombustion 3aglass 3aheat 3aindustry 3airon 3aneutralization 3anickel 3apower plants 3areducing agents 3aslags 3avanadium 3awaste management 0aBR 0aSHS 0aXRF 0aXRD 0aSEM 0aBS-SEM 0aBoiler residue 0aSHS 0aAluminothermic reduction1 aGhaderi Hamidi, Ahmad1 aPourabdoli, Mahdi0 tWaste management.g2018 Apr., v. 74 p.297-301dElsevier LtdwJournal:6325x0956-053X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2018.01.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02750naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100006000155245016900215520127000384592002801654650001601682650001101698650001001709650002101719650002001740650000901760650001001769650001301779650001101792650002101803650001301824650002101837650001501858653001401873653002301887653001901910653002001929700002301949700006001972700001902032700001602051700002402067773009002091856009002181852000902271655001202280IND60681447420221121001451.0200128e202005  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068144742DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2020.1258982doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAttaran, Anoosha1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7090-233110aEffects of chronic exposure to selenomethionine on social learning outcomes in zebrafish (Danio rerio): serotonergic dysregulation and oxidative stress in the brain  aFor many species, social learning is crucial for fitness-related activities, but human-induced environmental changes can impair such learning processes. For instance, mining can release the element, selenium (Se), that is vital for physiological functions but also has toxicological properties at elevated concentrations. In this study, we investigated the effects of chronic exposure to Se on social learning outcomes and potential underlying molecular mechanisms in adult zebrafish. After exposure to different levels of dietary selenomethionine (control, 3.6, 12.8, 34.1 μg Se/g dry weight) for 90 days, we examined the ability of observer fish to follow demonstrators (experienced individuals) in escaping an oncoming trawl. Social learning outcomes were then assessed in the absence of demonstrators. Our results indicated that fish in the highest exposure group (34.1 μg/g) displayed significantly slower escape responses compared to fish in the control and lower exposure groups (3.6 and 12.8 μg Se/g). This impaired behavior was associated with higher oxidative stress and dysregulation in genes that are key in the serotonergic pathway, indicating that oxidative stress and alteration in the serotonergic system lead to impairment of social learning.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDanio rerio 3aadults 3abrain 3achronic exposure 3aescape behavior 3afish 3agenes 3alearning 3amining 3aoxidative stress 3aselenium 3aselenomethionine 3atoxicology 0aSerotonin 0aLipid peroxidation 0aEscape latency 0aSocial learning1 aSalahinejad, Arash1 aNaderi, Mohammad1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7186-84861 aCrane, Adam L.1 aNiyogi, Som1 aChivers, Douglas P.0 tChemosphere.g2020 May, v. 247 p.125898-dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2020.1258983Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02069naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245013400170300001400304520109400318592002801412650001701440650001701457650002301474650001501497650001501512650001901527650001701546651001901563773011601582856004801698852000901746655001201755IND50061520820221121043035.0130319e201302  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006152082DNAL7 a10.1007/s10668-012-9375-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJones, Peter J.

Two key scale challenges raised by PAs are considered: (1) the divergence of objectives between resource exploitation and biodiversity conservation; (2) the requirement to fulfil biodiversity conservation obligations. These are explored through a review of a UK marine PA case study which found that even though the state had adopted a controlling role that had created tensions by undermining the authority and livelihoods of some stakeholders, the partnership had been sufficiently strengthened to withstand these tensions through the instrumental development of ‘bracing social capital’. Four conclusions for governance research with a particular reference to PA governance are drawn, and it is argued that presumptions based on Habermasian ideals should not constrain governance analyses, in that they should constructively incorporate the instrumental roles of the state.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiodiversity 3acase studies 3aconservation areas 3agovernance 3alivelihood 3asocial capital 3astakeholders 3aUnited Kingdom0 tEnvironment, development and sustainability.g2013 Feb., v. 15, no. 1 p.39-50dSpringer-Verlagx1387-585X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10668-012-9375-3  aDNAL 7aarticle03209naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100006400147245013000211300001200341520161200353592002801965596004501993650001202038650001102050650001202061650001002073650001502083650001702098650003502115650001102150650002202161650001102183650001102194650001502205650001102220650001202231650002302243650002002266650001802286650001502304650001502319651001002334651001002344651002102354700002502375700001902400700001802419773015102437856008202588852000902670655001202679IND60632508720221122232411.0200903e201904  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063250872DNAL7 a10.1007/s10661-019-7337-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOmwene, Philip Isaac1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8513-677X10aInfluence of arsenic and boron on the water quality index in mining stressed catchments of Emet and Orhaneli streams (Turkey)  ap. 199.  aEmet and Orhaneli stream basins are characterized by intense mining of colemanite, the main borate mineral in the area. Unlike other global borate deposits, the colemanite of this region contains arsenic minerals (realgar and orpiment). Undoubtedly, improper management of mine wastes causes pollution of water resources, affecting human life and biota. In the present study, spatial and temporal variation in water quality of Emet and Orhaneli streams was assessed. The water quality index (WQI) model was used to rate the overall status of the water, and geographical information systems (GIS) was used to aid the visualization of results. No significant differences in WQIs for the three-monitoring periods (March, July and October 2017) were noted. The WQI in the region is highly influenced by arsenic (As) and boron (B), with a strong positive correlation (p < 0.05, r² = 0.971). The As and B concentrations in Emet stream were 1.88–1907 μg/L and 0.01–1900 mg/L, respectively. Whereas for Orhaneli stream, respective As and B levels ranged from 5.17 to 116 μg/L and 0.01 to 5.45 mg/L. Globally, the As level in Emet stream basin is comparable to some of the words major contaminated regions such as Rapti River Basin (India) and Xieshui River (China). However, the uniqueness of this basin is seen in B and As trends, and input routes like active geothermal waters and weathering of the realgar (AsS) and orpiment (As₂S₃) from colemanite nodules. This paper demonstrates the influence of pollutants associated with basin geochemistry and exploration of mineral resources on WQI.  aPublisher supplied data  a2017-A101-07cGebze Technical University 3aarsenic 3abasins 3aborates 3aboron 3acolemanite 3ageochemistry 3ageographic information systems 3ahumans 3amineral resources 3amining 3amodels 3apollutants 3arivers 3astreams 3atemporal variation 3awater pollution 3awater quality 3awatersheds 3aweathering 3aChina 3aIndia 3aTurkey (country)1 aÖncel, Mehmet Salim1 aÇelen, Meltem1 aKobya, Mehmet0 tEnvironmental monitoring and assessment.g2019 Apr., v. 191, no. 4 p.199-199dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl33242x0167-63697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-019-7337-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02432naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100002800154245009900182300001600281500001900297520123200316592002801548650001501576650002401591650002101615650001101636650003201647650002201679650001201701650001201713650001701725653002401742653001201766653002201778773016101800856008801961852000902049655001202058IND60726312120221118204425.0210203e20210202xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072631212DNAL7 a10.3161/15052249PJE2020.68.4.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBednarz, Paula Antonina10aDo Decibels Matter? A Review of Effects of Traffic Noise on Terrestrial Small Mammals and Bats  ap. 323-333.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aNoise generated by human activities has increased over the last decades as a result of human population growth, global transport and urbanization. The understanding of the effect of noise on different animal populations is mandatory to help making informed decisions in the field of natural resource management. While managers often focus on rare, charismatic species, it is important to examine the effects of noise on species that are common because abundant species have strong ecological impacts. This paper describes the influence of traffic noise on representatives of two orders of mammals: rodents and bats. I reviewed field and laboratory studies that inspected the influence of traffic noise on the following aspects of rodent and bat ecology: (1) activity and behaviour, (2) abundance and habitat use, and (3) foraging. Bats tended to be negatively affected by traffic noise, although certain species demonstrated a considerable degree of tolerance to this disturbance. The effects of traffic noise on rodents were more varied, but typically consisted of detrimental changes in vigilance-foraging trade-off. However, research on rodents appears biased towards social species which rely on alarm calls for protection.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChiroptera 3ahabitat preferences 3ahuman population 3ahumans 3anatural resource management 3apopulation growth 3arodents 3atraffic 3aurbanization 0aanthropogenic noise 0amammals 0anoise disturbance0 tPolish Journal of Ecology.g2021 Feb. 2, v. 68, no. 4 p.323-333dMuseum and Institute of Zoology, Polish Academy of ScienceswJournal:16773x1505-22497nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3161/15052249PJE2020.68.4.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03089naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001400150245008900164300001600253520145400269592002801723650001601751650003801767650003701805650001301842650001101855650001801866650001401884650001401898650001401912650001101926650003301937650000901970650002101979650001002000653001402010653002802024653003202052653002602084653004302110700001702153700001602170700001902186700001902205700001802224700002002242700002202262700001602284700001502300700001902315773009502334856008502429852000902514655001202523IND60592450120221117091943.0200712e201804  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059245012DNAL7 a10.1016/j.wasman.2018.01.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSagar, M.12aA potential utilization of end-of-life tyres as recycled carbon black in EPDM rubber  ap. 110-122.  aEnd-of-life (EOL) tyres and their decomposition present severe environmental concern due to their resistance to moisture, oxygen, natural degradation, etc. Pyrolysis is considered to be the most effective and sustainable process for recycling, due to its eco-friendly process. The current work studied the effect of recycled carbon black (rCB), obtained from the pyrolysis of EOL tyres, on the properties of ethylene propylene diene rubber (EPDM). The rCB was characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and chemical methods. rCB was incorporated solely, into a conventional EPDM formulation and also in combination with N550 carbon black. The physico-mechanical properties of the EPDM vulcanizates, before and after aging, were succinctly studied by SEM, TGA, Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC), tensile tests and cross-link density. The average particle size of rCB was observed to be 8 µm and the ash content was observed to be higher when compared to the conventional N550 carbon black, which was evident, by the TGA and SEM-EDX analyses. The reinforcing effect and the cross-link density of the rCB-filled vulcanizates were found to be marginally inferior in comparison to the conventional carbon black (N550). The morphology of the tensile- and tear-fractured surfaces were studied by SEM and it was observed that the breaking mechanism follows the rubber chain detachment from the surface mode.  aPublisher supplied data 3aash content 3adifferential scanning calorimetry 3aenergy-dispersive X-ray analysis 3aethylene 3aoxygen 3aparticle size 3apropylene 3apyrolysis 3arecycling 3arubber 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asoot 3athermogravimetry 3atires 0aPyrolysis 0aEnd-of-life (EOL) tyres 0aRecycled carbon black (rCB) 0aMechanical properties 0aEthylene propylene diene rubber (EPDM)1 aNibedita, K.1 aManohar, N.1 aRaj Kumar, K.,1 aSuchismita, S.1 aPradnyesh, A.1 aReddy, A.

The mild hydrothermal treatment method does not need high temperature, and would not cause secondary pollution. Further, the modified NPRPs were used as the raw materials for the epoxy resin and glass fibers/epoxy resin composites, which were prepared by pouring and hot-pressing method. The mechanical properties and morphology of the composites were discussed. The results showed that relative intensity of the hydroxyl bonds on the surface of NPRPs increased 58.9% after modification. The mechanical tests revealed that both flexural and impact properties of the composites can be significantly improved by adding the modified NPRPs. Particularly, the maximum increment of flexural strength, flexural modulus and impact strength of the epoxy matrix composites with 30% modified NPRPs is 40.1%, 80.0% and 79.0%, respectively. Hydrothermal treatment can modify surface of NPRPs successfully and modified NPRPs can not only improve the properties of the composites, but also reduce the production cost of the composites and environmental pollution. Thus, we develop a new way to recycle nonmetallic materials of waste print circuit boards and the highest level of waste material recycling with the raw materials-products-raw materials closed cycle can be realized through the hydrothermal modification and reuse of NPRPs.  aPublisher supplied data 3acatalysts 3aepoxides 3aglass fibers 3ahot water treatment 3aimpact strength 3amechanical testing 3amodulus of rupture 3apollution 3araw materials 3arecycling 3asolvents 3atemperature 3awastes 0aWaste printed circuit boards 0aNonmetallic particles 0aHydrothermal modification 0aRecycling1 aLi, Qisheng1 aQiu, Jun0 tWaste management.g2018 Apr., v. 74 p.427-434dElsevier LtdwJournal:6325x0956-053X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2018.01.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02618naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002400139245016100163300001600324500002000340520137700360592002801737650001501765650001901780650001201799650001201811650001201823650001701835650001901852650001001871650001001881650001601891650002101907650001601928650001601944700002101960700002101981773012402002856007302126852000902199655001202208IND60520340420221120101507.0160519e201607  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052034042DNAL7 a10.1111/bij.127552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKamimura, Yoshitaka10aOvoviviparity and genital evolution: a lesson from an earwig species with coercive traumatic mating and accidental breakage of elongated intromittent organs  ap. 443-456.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aOvoviviparity or viviparity has evolved independently in animals and involves adaptations in females to accommodate developing embryos for a prolonged duration in their bodies, a condition which has likely to have influenced the evolution of the male genitalia. We aimed to ascertain whether the elongated male genitalia of the ovoviviparous free‐living earwig species Marava arachidis (Dermaptera: Spongiphoridae) delivers sperm directly to the female ovaries where fertilization occurs. Males mated coercively with females by grabbing the female antenna with their mouth parts. Although females resisted the mating attempts, pairs mated 3.3 times on average over 15 h. The elongated intromittent organ, known as a virga, was inserted into the long‐tubed spermatheca during insemination. Surgical ectomy of the spermatheca confirmed that sperm migrated from here to the ovaries with a variable delay. A pair of sclerites in the male genitalia frequently inflicted wounds near the spermathecal opening, while the single, thin virga sometimes broke off during mating. However, unlike earwigs bearing a ‘spare’ virga, damage was restricted to the tip of the virga, without which the males could still inseminate the females. We discuss the evolution of the genitalia in this insect in the light of sexual selection and sexual conflict over mating and fertilization.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDermaptera 3aanimal ovaries 3aanimals 3afemales 3ainsects 3ainsemination 3amale genitalia 3amales 3amouth 3aovovivipary 3asexual selection 3aspermatheca 3aspermatozoa1 aTee, Hui‐Siang1 aLee, Chow‐Yang0 tBiological journal of the Linnean Society.g2016 July, v. 118, no. 3 p.443-456dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx0024-40667nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/bij.127553Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03077naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004800094040001800142100002900160245013200189300001300321500001900334520160500353592002801958650001401986650001102000650003002011650001402041650002402055650002202079650001302101650001302114651001402127651001402141651001002155651001602165653002502181653002002206653002802226653001502254653001502269653001402284700002102298700002402319700002702343773012202370856009402492852000902586655001202595IND60726312420221118204113.0210203e20210125xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072631242DNAL7 a10.5252/cryptogamie-algologie2021v42a12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMontecinos, Alejandro E.10aMolecular Data Reveal the Presence of Three Plocamium Lamouroux Species with Complex Patterns of Distribution in Southern Chile  ap. 1-19.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aPlocamium Lamouroux is a widespread genus for which 45 species are currently recognized. However, classical taxonomy based only on morphological characters, is problematic within this genus. The use of molecular tools has uncovered cryptic genetic species, mistakenly grouped under the name of morphological species that are common and widespread (including the generitype Plocamium cartilagineum (Linnaeus) P.S.Dixon). The aim of this work was to evaluate the species diversity of Plocamium in Southern Chile. For this purpose, three independent molecular markers were sequenced in samples collected from seven populations located between 41°S and 54°S. The species diversity was evaluated using phylogenetic reconstructions and two independent methods for species delimitation (ABGD and GMYC). The outcomes of each method were congruent, suggesting the presence of three species in Southern Chile. One species, named Plocamium sp. 1, is restricted to Punta Guabún, the only locality sampled north of the biogeographic barrier of the 42°S. The other two species, Plocamium sp. 2 and 3 are distributed in sympatry in Patagonia and Tierra del Fuego. The three Chilean species form a clade phylogenetically close to sequences obtained from New Zealand and Australia and a divergence along the coasts of Chile after past transoceanic dispersal is proposed. We propose that divergence in glacial microrefugia could have subsequently happen in the southern part of the coast, this hypothesis being supported by the strong impact of glacial maxima on population dynamics, especially in Plocamium sp. 3.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPlocamium 3acoasts 3ageographical distribution 3aphylogeny 3apopulation dynamics 3aspecies diversity 3asympatry 3ataxonomy 3aArgentina 3aAustralia 3aChile 3aNew Zealand 0aSpecies delimitation 0agenetic species 0along-distance dispersal 0aspeciation 0aRhodophyta 0ared algae1 aHuanel, Oscar R.1 aRamírez, María E.1 aGuillemin, Marie-Laure0 tCryptogamie.g2021 Jan. 25, v. 42, no. 1 p.1-19dAssociation des Amis des CryptogameswJournal:11619x1776-09847nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.5252/cryptogamie-algologie2021v42a13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02774naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100006800151245012800219520126100347592002801608650001501636650002001651650001901671650001801690650001501708650003001723650001701753650001501770653001501785653002001800653001901820653001901839653002101858700002601879700006401905700002001969700001801989700001902007700002102026700002502047700003002072773011902102856008602221852000902307655001202316IND60730752320221120232438.0210610e202108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073075232DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jnutbio.2021.1086232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVazhappilly, Cijo George1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2742-627710aCurrent methodologies to refine bioavailability, delivery, and therapeutic efficacy of plant flavonoids in cancer treatment  aOver the last two decades, several advancements have been made to improve the therapeutic efficacy of plant flavonoids, especially in cancer treatment. Factors such as low bioavailability, poor flavonoid stability and solubility, ineffective targeted delivery, and chemo-resistance hinder the application of flavonoids in anti-cancer therapy. Many anti-cancer compounds failed in the clinical trials because of unexpected altered clearance of flavonoids, poor absorption after administration, low efficacy, and/or adverse effects. Hence, the current research strategies are focused on improving the therapeutic efficacy of plant flavonoids, especially by enhancing their bioavailability through combination therapy, engineering gut microbiota, regulating flavonoids interaction with adenosine triphosphate binding cassette efflux transporters, and efficient delivery using nanocrystal and encapsulation technologies. This review aims to discuss different methodologies with examples from reported dietary flavonoids that showed an enhanced anti-cancer efficacy in both in vitro and in vivo models. Further, the review discusses the recent progress in biochemical modifications of flavonoids to improve bioavailability, solubility, and therapeutic efficacy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3abioavailability 3acancer therapy 3aencapsulation 3aflavonoids 3aintestinal microorganisms 3ananocrystals 3asolubility 0aFlavonoids 0aBioavailability 0aGut microbiota 0aNanotechnology 0aCancer treatment1 aAmararathna, Madumani1 aCyril, Asha Caroline1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7524-96501 aLinger, Rebecca1 aMatar, Rachel1 aMerheb, Maxime1 aRamadan, Wafaa S1 aRadhakrishnan, Rajan1 aRupasinghe, H.P.

In this work the performance of the thermochemical processes of sewage sludge at different oxygen concentrations was investigated by thermogravimetric (TG) and Fourier transform infrared analysis (FTIR) study. The oxygen concentrations were varied systematically from 0 to 20%, representing heating process from pyrolysis to full combustion. The evolutions of surface functional groups in these processes were also investigated by in situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectra (DRIFT), which helped to understand the reaction mechanism during the thermal degradation, especially when the reaction conditions were different. The heating process was divided into four stages, dehydration (below 200 °C), devolatilization (200–400 °C), char combustion (above 400 °C), and secondary devolatilization (above 650 °C). Reaction mechanism and kinetic model was proposed based on the stages of heating process. Oxygen concentration was presented explicitly in the reactions and kinetic equations. The model was then developed for the heating processes at different oxygen concentrations, followed by fittings of kinetic parameters. Some of the parameters in the model were fixed as constants to minimize the number of variations. The fitted model agreed well with the TG curves at different oxygen concentrations and could illustrate the evolution of intermediates and products during the heating process. The developed kinetic model could be further applied for the modeling of sewage sludge pellets combustion considering oxygen diffusion process.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3acombustion 3aequations 3akinetics 3amodels 3amoieties 3amunicipal wastewater 3aoxygen 3apellets 3apyrolysis 3areaction mechanisms 3areflectance 3asewage sludge 3athermogravimetry 3awastewater treatment 0aSewage sludge 0aCombustion 0aOxygen concentration 0aModeling 0aKinetics 0aFTIR1 aZhang, Ming1 aWang, Zhiqiang1 aXu, Guiying1 aMa, Chunyuan0 tWaste management.g2018 Apr., v. 74 p.279-287dElsevier LtdwJournal:6325x0956-053X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2018.01.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02721naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001200148245013600160300001000296500001900306520099100325592002801316596007601344596007601420596005901496650003001555650002901585650002001614650001101634650001101645650001701656650001901673650002301692650001601715650002201731650001401753650001001767650001701777650001601794650001501810651001601825700001701841700001601858700001501874700001701889700001601906700001701922700001501939773013301954856008302087852000902170655001202179IND60692682220221122044336.0201215e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069268222DNAL7 a10.1186/s13021-020-00142-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLei, Wu14aThe impact of increasing land productivity on groundwater dynamics: a case study of an oasis located at the edge of the Gobi Desert  ap. 7.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aBACKGROUND: Intensification of agricultural systems may result in overexploitation of water resources in arid regions because enhanced productivity of crops is often associated with increased actual evapotranspiration (AET). The aim of this study was to quantify the effect of increased regional AET on the groundwater level in a case study of the oasis located within the Shiyang River Basin near the edge of the Gobi Desert. RESULT: The results of the study show that regional AET increased during the period from 1981 to 2010 due to increasing oasis area and air temperature. The water losses due to AET exceeded the water supply from the mountainous discharges of the basin by the end of this period, leading to groundwater overexploitation in the oasis area. CONCLUSIONS: This case study shows the importance of considering the effect of climate change on water losses associated with increasing agricultural production for the sustainable agricultural development of arid regions.  aPublisher supplied data  a2017YFC0504306cNational Key Research and Development Programs of China  a2017YFC0504801cNational Key Research and Development Programs of China  a41671017cNational Natural Science Foundation of China 3aadministrative management 3aagricultural development 3aair temperature 3abasins 3acarbon 3acase studies 3aclimate change 3aevapotranspiration 3agroundwater 3aland productivity 3amountains 3aoases 3awater supply 3awater table 3awatersheds 3aGobi Desert1 aChangbin, Li1 aXuhong, Xie1 aZhibin, He1 aWanrui, Wang1 aYuan, Zhang1 aJianmei, Wei1 aJianan, Lv0 tCarbon balance and management.g2020 Dec., v. 15, no. 1 p.7-7dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:19518x1750-06807nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13021-020-00142-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02680naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002100152245014000173300001400313520156300327592002801890650001401918650001701932650003001949650002201979651001302001653003102014653002302045653001702068653002202085653003402107773010502141856008702246852000902333655001202342IND60526377520221119172355.0190405e201606  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052637752DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jrurstud.2016.02.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEaton, Weston M.10aWhat's the problem? How ‘industrial culture’ shapes community responses to proposed bioenergy development in northern Michigan, USA  ap. 76-87.  aWhy do two similar places respond to the same renewable energy technology development proposal in contrasting ways — as a problem in one community, and a non-problem in the other? In response to William Freudenburg's call to examine the role of ideologies in the social construction of both environmental problems and non-problems, and drawing from Ann Swidler's concept of cultural resources, this paper develops and applies an integrative framework the author calls industrial culture. The paper examines how industrial cultures — the stories, discourses, orientations, and practices around industrial development and accompanying environmental degradation that are commonplace in particular locales — shape community responses to proposed future development by both constraining and providing opportunities for new trajectories of action. This process is illustrated with a comparative case study of two adjacent and outwardly similar industrialized northern Michigan communities with legacies of environmental degradation that encounter the same bioenergy development proposal but respond in contrasting ways. Findings suggest community residents construct industrial cultures around both a) past industrial development and environmental degradation and b) the imagined future impact bioenergy development would have on the community. The paper extends the literature on environmental non-problems by showing how the social construction of non-problems is driven not only by explicitly articulated ideologies, but also by unquestioned common sense.  aPublisher supplied data 3abioenergy 3acase studies 3aenvironmental degradation 3aindustrialization 3aMichigan 0aEnvironmental non-problems 0aCultural resources 0aMobilization 0aRural communities 0aRenewable energy technologies0 tJournal of rural studies.g2016 June, v. 45 p.76-87dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl38039x0743-01677nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jrurstud.2016.02.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02207naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245012600166300001400292500001900306520094600325592002801271596005501299650001501354650002001369650002901389650001101418650000701429650001401436650000901450650001501459651001001474700002001484700001201504700001601516700001401532700001801546773014201564856008201706852000901788655001201797IND60726312620221118203459.0210203e202101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072631262DNAL7 a10.1007/s00128-020-02837-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYan, Bingshu,10aPotential Ecological Risk Assessment of Heavy Metals in the Fe–Mn Nodules in the Karst Area of Guangxi, Southwest China  ap. 51-56.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aWe investigated the concentration of heavy metals in the Fe–Mn nodules in soils derived from the carbonate rocks of typical karst areas in Guangxi, Southwest China. Compared with the soil background values in Guangxi, heavy metals are substantially enriched in the following order: Cd (268.13) > Pb (39.46) > Cr (11.80) > Zn (8.43) > Ni (6.16) > Cu (3.65). CaCl₂ extraction results indicate that heavy metals in the nodules are substantially stable, while the proportions of the metals released to the surrounding environment are extremely low (≤ 0.003%). Moreover, pH-static leaching experiments indicate that heavy metals can hardly be dissolved into the surrounding soil environment under natural conditions (pH 6–8). However, once the soil environment is acidified, heavy metals incorporated in the nodules will gradually release into the surrounding environment, thereby causing potential ecological risks.  aPublisher supplied data  a2017YFD0800304cMinistry of Science and Technology 3acarbonates 3aedaphic factors 3aenvironmental assessment 3akarsts 3apH 3apollution 3asoil 3atoxicology 3aChina1 aYang, Zhongfang1 aYu, Tao1 aYang, Qiong1 aWen, Yubo1 aWu, Tiansheng0 tBulletin of environmental contamination and toxicology.g2021 Jan., v. 106, no. 1 p.51-56dSpringer USwJournal:jnl46145x0007-48617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00128-020-02837-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02847naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245007300166300001800239500001100257520119800268592002801466596005401494650001701548650002601565650001901591650002301610650001001633650002001643650001401663650001401677650001301691650003101704650001001735650001301745650002201758650001301780650001201793650001701805700001801822700002801840700002801868700001701896700002401913700002101937700001801958700001901976700005901995700002302054773012402077856008302201852000902284655001202293IND60768102020221116231630.0220225e202203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076810202DNAL7 a10.1007/s11033-021-07007-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSalehi, Mahsa10aGastrointestinal cancer drug resistance: the role of exosomal miRNAs  ap. 2421-2432.  aReview  aResistance of gastrointestinal (GI) cancer cells to therapeutic agents are one of the major problems in treating this type of cancer. Although the exact mechanism of drug resistance has not yet been fully elucidated, various factors have been identified as contributing factors involved in this process. Several studies have revealed the role of exosomes, especially exosomal microRNAs (miRNAs), in GI tumorigenesis, invasion, angiogenesis, and drug resistance. Exosomes, a type of small extracellular vesicles (EVs), are originated from endosomes and are released into the extracellular environment and body fluids by different cell types. Exosomes mediate cell–cell communication by transferring different cargos, including miRNAs, between parent and recipient cells. Therefore, identifying these exosomal miRNAs and their functions in GI cancers might provide new clues to further explore the secret of this process and thus help in drug-resistance management. This review article will discuss the roles of exosomal miRNAs and their mechanisms of action in drug resistance of different types of GI cancer cells (e.g., stomach, esophagus, liver, pancreas, and colon) to therapeutic agents.  aPublisher supplied data  a1400U-1251cAbadan University of Medical Sciences 3aangiogenesis 3aantineoplastic agents 3acarcinogenesis 3acell communication 3acolon 3adrug resistance 3aendosomes 3aesophagus 3aexosomes 3agastrointestinal neoplasms 3aliver 3amicroRNA 3amolecular biology 3apancreas 3astomach 3atherapeutics1 aVafadar, Asma1 aKhatami, Seyyed Hossein1 aTaheri-Anganeh, Mortaza1 aVakili, Omid1 aSavardashtaki, Amir1 aNegahdari, Babak1 aNaeli, Parisa1 aBehrouj, Hamid1 aGhasemi, Hassan1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7809-27321 aMovahedpour, Ahmad0 tMolecular biology reports.g2022 Mar., v. 49, no. 3 p.2421-2432dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl5510x0301-48517nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11033-021-07007-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02622naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002300094040001800117100001800135245013200153300001500285520109800300592002801398650001401426650001901440650001601459650002301475650001501498650001101513650001501524650001301539650001201552650002201564651001801586700001701604700002301621700002001644700001501664700002201679700002401701700002301725700002601748700001601774773015301790856006901943856009602012990002302108852000902131655001202140IND60666316020221117233851.0190917e20190912xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066631602DNAL7 a10.3791/593402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPhilp, Lauren13aAn orthotopic endometrial cancer model with retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy made from in vivo propagated and cultured vx2 cells  ap. e59340.  aEndometrial cancer is the most common gynecologic malignancy in North America and the incidence is rising worldwide. Treatment consists of surgery with or without adjuvant therapy depending on lymph node involvement as determined by lymphadenectomy. Lymphadenectomy is a morbid procedure, which has not been shown to have a therapeutic benefit in many patients, and thus a new method to diagnose lymph node metastases is required. To test novel imaging agents, a reliable model of endometrial cancer with retroperitoneal lymph node metastases is needed. The VX2 endometrial cancer model has been described frequently in the literature; however, significant variation exists with respect to the method of model establishment. Furthermore, no studies have reported on the use of cultured VX2 cells to create this model as only cells propagated in vivo have been previously used. Herein, we present a standardized surgical method and post-operative monitoring method for the establishment of the VX2 endometrial cancer model and report on the first use of cultured VX2 cells to create this model.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadjuvants 3aimage analysis 3alymph nodes 3alymphatic diseases 3ametastasis 3amodels 3amonitoring 3apatients 3asurgery 3auterine neoplasms 3aNorth America1 aChan, Harley1 aRouzbahman, Marjan1 aRostami, Ariana1 aDing, Lili1 aBratman, Scott V.1 aAkens, Margarete K.1 aIrish, Jonathan C.1 aBernardini, Marcus Q.1 aZheng, Gang0 tJournal of visualized experiments.g2019 Sept. 12, , no. 151 p.e59340-e59340dJournal of Visualized ExperimentswJournal:jnl4469330x1940-087X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3791/593403Available from publisher's site  uhttp://www.jove.com/video/59340/an-orthotopic-endometrial-cancer-model-with-retroperitoneal  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02930naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001700152245013500169300001600304520161800320592002801938650001501966650002601981650001202007650002402019650002302043650001602066650001202082653002302094653003302117653003402150653003202184653002502216653002602241653002202267700001702289700001702306773010202323856008602425852000902511655001202520IND60563870620221118150243.0170713e20160901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056387062DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enconman.2016.06.0522doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAllam, Dalia10aParameters extraction of the three diode model for the multi-crystalline solar cell/module using Moth-Flame Optimization Algorithm  ap. 535-548.  aAs a result of the wide prevalence of using the multi-crystalline silicon solar cells, an accurate mathematical model for these cells has become an important issue. Therefore, a three diode model is proposed as a more precise model to meet the relatively complicated physical behavior of the multi-crystalline silicon solar cells. The performance of this model is compared to the performance of both the double diode and the modified double diode models of the same cell/module. Therefore, there is a persistent need to keep searching for a more accurate optimization algorithm to estimate the more complicated models’ parameters. Hence, a proper optimization algorithm which is called Moth-Flame Optimizer (MFO), is proposed as a new optimization algorithm for the parameter extraction process of the three tested models based on data measured at laboratory and other data reported at previous literature. To verify the performance of the suggested technique, its results are compared with the results of the most recent and powerful techniques in the literature such as Hybrid Evolutionary (DEIM) and Flower Pollination (FPA) algorithms. Furthermore, evaluation analysis is performed for the three algorithms of the selected models at different environmental conditions. The results show that, MFO algorithm achieves the least Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Mean Bias Error (MBE), Absolute Error at the Maximum Power Point (AEMPP) and best Coefficient of Determination. In addition, MFO is reaching to the optimal solution with the shortest execution time when it is compared with the other tested algorithms.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3aenvironmental factors 3aflowers 3amathematical models 3aphotovoltaic cells 3apollination 3asilicon 0aDouble diode model 0aFlower Pollination algorithm 0aHybrid Evolutionary technique 0aModified double diode model 0aMoth-Flame optimizer 0aParameters estimation 0aThree diode model1 aYousri, D.A.1 aEteiba, M.B.0 tEnergy conversion and management.g2016 Sept. 01, v. 123 p.535-548dElsevier Ltdx0196-89047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enconman.2016.06.0523Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02349naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001800144245015400162300002000316520099700336592002801333650001401361650002501375650001901400650001301419650001201432650001201444653002701456653002201483653002401505653003701529653001801566653002901584700001901613700001801632700002301650700002001673700001901693773012601712856008001838852000901918655001201927IND60579694620221118231847.0170830e20170830xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057969462DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.7b075722doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKwon, Taehoon10aSulfonated Copper Phthalocyanine/Sulfonated Polysulfone Composite Membrane for Ionic Polymer Actuators with High Power Density and Fast Response Time  ap. 29063-29070.  aIonic polymer composite membranes based on sulfonated poly(arylene ether sulfone) (SPAES) and copper(II) phthalocyanine tetrasulfonic acid (CuPCSA) are assembled into bending ionic polymer actuators. CuPCSA is an organic filler with very high sulfonation degree (IEC = 4.5 mmol H⁺/g) that can be homogeneously dispersed on the molecular scale into the SPAES membrane, probably due to its good dispersibility in SPAES-containing solutions. SPAES/CuPCSA actuators exhibit larger ion conductivity (102 mS cm–¹), tensile modulus (208 MPa), strength (101 MPa), and strain (1.21%), exceptionally faster response to electrical stimuli, and larger mechanical power density (3028 W m–³) than ever reported for ion-conducting polymer actuators. This outstanding actuation performance of SPAES/CuPCSA composite membrane actuators makes them attractive for next-generation transducers with high power density, which are currently developed, e.g., for underwater propulsion and endoscopic surgery.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactuators 3aasymmetric membranes 3adispersibility 3apolymers 3aprotons 3asurgery 0aionic polymer actuator 0aorganic composite 0apolymer electrolyte 0asulfonated copper phthalocyanine 0aresponse rate 0amechanical power density1 aCho, Hyeongrae1 aLee, Jang-Woo1 aHenkensmeier, Dirk1 aKang, Youngjong1 aKoo, Chong Min0 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2017 Aug. 30, v. 9, no. 34 p.29063-29070dAmerican Chemical Societyx1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facsami.7b075723Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02835naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100001900171245007900190300001600269520151800285592002801803650001201831650001601843650001001859650001001869650001401879650001401893650001301907650001201920650001001932650001801942650001201960650001901972650001101991650001702002650002502019650001302044650000902057650001302066650002702079650002702106650002802133700001502161773010102176856005502277852000902332655001202341IND4468230620221118005034.0120727e201201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446823062DNAL7 a221330952pmid7 a10.1111/j.1365-294X.2011.05386.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHAAPANIEMI, K.10aReproductive conflicts in polyandrous and polygynous ant Formica sanguinea  ap. 421-430.  aThe occurrence of multiple reproductives within an ant colony changes the balance between indirect fitness benefits and reproductive competition. We test whether the number of matings by an ant queen (polyandry) correlates negatively with the number of reproductive queens in the colony (polygyny), whether the patrilines and matrilines differ in their contribution to the sexual and worker progeny and whether there is an overall reproductive skew. For these aims, we genotyped both worker and sexual offspring from colonies of the ant Formica sanguinea in three populations. Most colonies were monogynous, but eight (11%) were polygynous with closely related queens. Most queens in the monogynous colonies (86%) had mated with multiple males. The effective paternity was lower than the actual number of mates, and the paternity skew was significant. Furthermore, in some monogynous colonies, the patrilines were differently represented in the worker pupae and sexual pupae produced at the same time. Likewise, the matrilines in polygynous colonies were differently present in worker pupae and male offspring. The effective number of matings by a queen was significantly lower in polygynous colonies (mean me = 1.68) than in monogynous colonies (means 2.06–2.61). The results give support to the hypotheses that polyandry and polygyny are alternative breeding strategies and that reproductive competition can lead to different representation of patrilines and matrilines among the sexual and worker broods.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFormica 3acorrelation 3alabor 3amales 3apaternity 3apolyandry 3apolygyny 3aprogeny 3apupae 3areproductives 2aAnimals 2aAntsxgenetics 2aFemale 2aGenetic Loci 2aGenetics, Population 2aGenotype 2aMale 2aMarriage 2aMicrosatellite Repeats 2aReproductionxgenetics 2aSexual Behavior, Animal1 aPAMILO, P.0 tMolecular ecology.g2012 Jan., v. 21, no. 2 p.421-430dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0962-10837nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-294X.2011.05386.x  aDNAL 7aarticle02960naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100002200141245012900163520171600292592002802008650002602036650001302062650001502075650001002090650001302100650001402113650001102127650001002138650001602148650001402164650001102178650001602189650001202205651001702217700002102234700002702255700002502282700002502307773012102332856007602453852000902529655001202538IND60760567620221121185914.0211223e20211130xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076056762DNAL7 a10.3390/ani111234132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOrioles, Massimo 10aHistological and Ultrastructural Description of Benign Adipocytic Tumors in Farmed Striped Sea Bream (Lythognathus mormyrus)  aCutaneous neoplasms affecting wild striped bream (Lythognathus mormyrus) have been recorded after their introduction in a marine aquaculture farm in the Adriatic Sea. The tumors were evident on 24% of the reared fish, showing single or multiple nodules, with a diameter ranging between 0.5–4.0 cm. Histologically, all the neoplastic lesions were located in the stratum spongiosum of the dermis and were surrounded by a thin capsule of connective tissue. The tumors were predominantly composed of adipocytes grouped and surrounded by a thin net of fibroblasts and collagen fibers. In some lipomas a mixture of adipocytes and uniform spindle cells were also observed. Fibroblasts and collagen fibers, or spindle cells, showing few mitotic figures were mainly observed in other nodules. Three of the tumors showed bands of cells with elongated nuclei. Five neoplasms differed from the classic spindle cell lipoma due to the presence of scattered giant cells. These cells presented acidophilic abundant cytoplasm with multiple hyperchromatic nuclei showing a concentric “floret-like” arrangement. The tumors were further characterized by ultrastructural observations that allowed ruling out the presence of virus-like particles within the lesions. Histological features of the masses lead to the identification of four prevalent patterns of neoplasms: lipoma, fibrolipoma, spindle cell lipoma (SCL), and atypical spindle cell-like lipoma (ASCL). The different neoplasms could arise from the transformation of mesenchymal cells of dermal origin. To the author’s knowledge, this is the first report describing key differential histological and ultrastructural features of these neoplasms in striped sea bream.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLithognathus mormyrus 3aMormyrus 3aadipocytes 3abream 3acollagen 3acytoplasm 3adermis 3afarms 3afibroblasts 3ahistology 3alipoma 3amariculture 3amitosis 3aAdriatic Sea1 aGaleotti, Marco 1 aPatarnello, Pierpaolo 1 aPizzolitto, Stefano 1 aVolpatti, Donatella 0 tAnimals.g2021 Nov. 30, v. 11, no. 12dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2274x2076-26157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ani111234133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03602naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002300139245012400162300001800286500002000304520242500324592002802749650002202777650001602799650001602815650000902831650001302840650002102853650001002874650001102884650001402895650001102909650001402920650002202934650001602956650001502972700002402987773009903011856007303110852000903183655001203192IND60523625320221122125226.0160623e201212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052362532DNAL7 a10.1890/11-2078.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSinger, Michael C.10aGeographic mosaics of species' association: a definition and an example driven by plant–insect phenological synchrony  ap. 2658-2673.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aSpatial mosaics occur in both evolutionary and ecological properties of species' interactions. Studies of these patterns have facilitated description and prediction of evolutionary responses of interacting species to each other and to changing environments. We propose seeking complementary understanding of community assembly and dynamics by studying ecological and mechanistic properties of mosaics. We define “species' association mosaics” as deviations from a null model in which spatial variation in the extent to which particular species interact ecologically is explained solely by variation in their densities. In extreme deviations from the null, a focal species interacts exclusively with different partners at different sites despite similar abundances of potential partners. We investigate this type of mosaic involving the butterfly Euphydryas editha and its hosts, the perennial Pedicularis semibarbata (Psem) and the ephemeral annual Collinsia torreyi (Ctor). A reciprocal transplant experiment showed that the proximate, mechanistic driver of the mosaic was variation in butterfly oviposition preference: the identity of the preferred host species depended on the site of origin of the insects, not that of the plants. In contrast, the evolutionary driver was phenological asynchrony between the insects and Ctor. Censuses showed that larvae hatching from eggs laid on Ctor would have suffered significantly greater mortality from host senescence at five sites where Ctor was avoided than at two sites where it was used. These differences among sites in phenological synchrony were caused by variation in life span of Ctor. At sites where Ctor was avoided, natural selection on host preference was stabilizing because Ctor life span was too short to accommodate the development time of most larvae. At sites where Ctor was used, selection on preference was also stabilizing because larvae lacked physiological adaptation to feed on Psem. These reciprocal forces of stabilizing selection formed a mosaic maintaining spatial variation in insect host preference that was the proximate cause of the species‐association mosaic. In the Discussion, we examine the extent to which our findings hindcast an observed anthropogenic host shift by E. editha from Psem to Ctor. This example shows that elucidation of species‐association mosaics can facilitate understanding of community evolution and dynamics.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEuphydryas editha 3aPedicularis 3abutterflies 3aeggs 3ahatching 3ahost preferences 3ahosts 3alarvae 3alongevity 3amodels 3amortality 3anatural selection 3aoviposition 3aprediction1 aMcBride, Carolyn S.0 tEcology.g2012 Dec., v. 93, no. 12 p.2658-2673dEcological Society of Americax0012-96587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1890/11-2078.13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03169naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001600164245010400180300001400284520156700298592002801865650001101893650002601904650001701930650001401947650001701961650001001978650002101988650002302009650001902032650001302051650001702064650002202081650006602103650003202169650002102201650006702222650003202289650001102321650006002332650002302392650001702415651001102432700001302443700001302456700001802469773009502487856004802582852000902630655001202639IND4469617420221118052152.0121003e201207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446961742DNAL7 a222151962pmid7 a10.1007/s00436-011-2801-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDegerli, S.10aAmoebicidal activity of the rhizomes and aerial parts of Allium sivasicum on Entamoeba histolytica   ap. 59-64.  aAmebiasis is a severe illness caused by Entamoebachistolytica. The aim of this study is to evaluate the in vitro amebicidal activity of the rhizomes and aerial parts of Allium sivasicum, an endemic plant species from the flora of Turkey. Both extracts showed a time- and dose-dependent amebicidal action on the trophozoites. Among the extracts tested, rhizomes of A. sivasicum showed the strongest amebicidal effect on the trophozoites. In the presence of the rhizome extract at 2.0 mg/ml concentration, all of the trophozoites available in media have completely been killed within the 72nd hour. At 4.0 mg/ml extract concentration, all of the trophozoites available in media have completely been killed by the rhizome extract from the time of 24th hour. At 32.0 mg/ml extract concentration, 73.7% of the trophozoites were successfully killed by the extract within the first experimental hour. Aerial part extract at 4.0 mg/ml concentration completely killed the trophozoited within the 48th hour of the experimental procedure. At 8.0 mg/ml extract concentration, all of the trophozoites available in media have completely been killed by the aerial part extract from the time of 24th hour. At 32.0 mg/ml extract concentration, 67.7% of the trophozoites were successfully killed by the extract within the first experimental hour. These results suggest that the plant species evaluated here is a potential therapeutic drug for the treatment of Entamoeba infections, but it still needs to be evaluated quantitatively for determining the active phytochemicals.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAllium 3aEntamoeba histolytica 3aaerial parts 3aamebiasis 3adrug therapy 3aflora 3ain vitro studies 3aindigenous species 3aphytochemicals 3arhizomes 3atrophozoites 2aAlliumxchemistry 2aAntiprotozoal Agentsxisolation & purificationxpharmacology. 2aCell Survivalxdrug effects 2aChild, Preschool 2aEntamoeba histolyticaxdrug effectsxisolation & purification. 2aEntamoebiasisxparasitology 2aHumans 2aPlant Extractsxisolation & purificationxpharmacology. 2aRhizomexchemistry 2aTime Factors 0aTurkey1 aBerk, S.1 aTepe, B.1 aMalatyali, E.0 tParasitology research.g2012 July, v. 111, no. 1 p.59-64dSpringer-Verlagx0932-01137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00436-011-2801-x  aDNAL 7aarticle03571naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002600152245010400178300001600282520216000298592002802458650001302486650001302499650002202512650002402534650001902558650001402577650001102591650001502602650002302617650001102640650001502651650001102666650001102677650001102688653002802699653002102727653001402748653001902762653001802781653002602799700002102825700002202846700002302868773009102891856008602982852000903068655001203077IND60545920620221117202254.0160903e201401  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054592062DNAL7 a10.1016/j.atmosres.2012.09.0232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBlakeslee, Richard J.10aSeasonal variations in the lightning diurnal cycle and implications for the global electric circuit  ap. 228-243.  aData obtained from the Optical Transient Detector and the Lightning Imaging Sensor satellites (70° and 35° inclination low earth orbits, respectively) are used to statistically determine the number of flashes in the seasonal diurnal cycle as a function of local and universal time. These data include corrections for detection efficiency and instrument view time. They are further subdivided by season, land versus ocean, and other spatial (e.g., continents) and temporal (e.g., time of peak diurnal amplitude) categories. These statistics are then combined with analyses of high altitude aircraft observations of electrified clouds to produce the seasonal diurnal variation in the global electric circuit. Continental results display strong diurnal variation, with a lightning peak in the late afternoon and a minimum in late morning. In geographical regions dominated by large mesoscale convective systems, the peak in the diurnal curve shifts toward late evening or early morning hours. The maximum seasonal diurnal flash rate occurs in June–August, corresponding to the Northern Hemisphere summer, while the minimum occurs in December–February. Summer lightning dominates over winter activity and springtime lightning dominates over fall activity at most continental locations. Oceanic lightning exhibits minimal diurnal variation, but morning hours are slightly enhanced over afternoon. As was found earlier, for the annual diurnal variation, using basic assumptions about the mean storm currents as a function of flash rate and location (i.e., land/ocean), our seasonal estimates of the current in the global electric circuit provide an excellent match with independent measurements of the seasonal Carnegie curve diurnal variations. The maximum (minimum) total mean current of 2.4kA (1.7kA) is found during Northern Hemisphere summer (winter). Land thunderstorms supply about one half (52%) of the total global current. Ocean thunderstorms contribute about one third (31%) and the non-lightning producing ocean electrified shower clouds (ESCs) supply one sixth (15%) of the total global current. Land ESCs make only a small contribution (2%).  aPublisher supplied data 3aaircraft 3aaltitude 3adiurnal variation 3aelectronic circuits 3aimage analysis 3alightning 3aorbits 3asatellites 3aseasonal variation 3aspring 3astatistics 3astorms 3asummer 3awinter 0aGlobal electric circuit 0aGlobal lightning 0aLightning 0aCarnegie curve 0aStorm current 0aLightning climatology1 aMach, Douglas M.1 aBateman, Monte G.1 aBailey, Jeffrey C.0 tAtmospheric research.g2014 Jan., v. 135-136 p.228-243dElsevier B.V.x0169-80957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.atmosres.2012.09.0233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02681naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100002100137245009100158300001600249520153200265592002801797650002401825650002401849650002101873650001801894650002101912650001101933650002601944650001601970650001901986650001502005650000902020650002302029650001702052650001402069700002402083773009602107856007102203852000902274655001202283IND60518832220221120140649.0160419e198908  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051883222DNAL7 a10.2307/19413582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMunger, James C.10aSublethal Parasites and Host Energy Budgets: Tapeworm Infection in White‐Footed Mice  ap. 904-921.  aOne way to study a parasite's effect on the individual and population ecology of its host is to examine effects on the host's energy budget. A relatively innocuous effect of a gut parasite, such as decreased digestive efficiency, can potentially translate into an effect costly to host fitness, such as decreased reproduction, if other compensations (such as increased rate of food intake) do not occur. We found that infection by the tapeworm Hymenolepis citelli caused a 2% drop in dry—matter digestibility in host white—footed mice (Peromyscus leucopus). A crowding experiment indicated that this result should be applicable to a wide range of intensities of infection. However, we detected no compensation for this decreased digestive efficiency either in amount of food consumed or in mass change (which would indicate use of fat stores or changes in growth). In field experiments we used doubly labeled water to measure effects of tapeworms on field metabolic rate and water influx (potentially a measure of food intake rate), and temperature—sensitive transmitters to measure body temperature. We detected no compensations via these routes either. Our failure to detect compensations indicates that in the nonreproductive mice studied the decrease in digestive efficiency is not of sufficient importance to engender substantial compensations and is therefore unlikely to lead to fitness—altering effects. It is in reproductive animals or in animals subjected to food shortage that such effects would be expected.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHymenolepis citelli 3aPeromyscus leucopus 3abody temperature 3adigestibility 3adigestive system 3aenergy 3afield experimentation 3afood intake 3afood shortages 3ametabolism 3amice 3apopulation ecology 3areproduction 3atapeworms1 aKarasov, William H.0 tEcology.g1989 Aug., v. 70, no. 4 p.904-921dEcological Society of Americax0012-96587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2307/19413583Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03357naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001800155245016600173300001400339520174500353592002802098650001402126650002102140650002102161650001302182650001502195650001302210650003802223650002002261650001602281650002002297650002102317650001202338650001402350650001302364650002002377650001602397650001302413651001602426651000902442651001302451653001202464653002102476653000902497653001202506653003402518700002102552700002602573700002802599773007802627856008902705852000902794655001202803IND60573315520221121065752.0170724e201709  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057331552DNAL7 a10.1016/j.actatropica.2017.05.0262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNazeri, Saeed10aNaturally acquired immune responses to thrombospondin-related adhesion protein (TRAP) of Plasmodium vivax in patients from areas of unstable malaria transmission  ap. 45-54.  aA key tool for the control, elimination, and eradication of Plasmodium vivax is the development of an effective vaccine. The thrombospondin-related adhesion protein (TRAP) is one of the major sporozoite antigens that plays an important role in the invasion of mosquito salivary glands and hepatocytes by sporozoites. The main goal of this study was to evaluate the naturally acquired antibodies to the P. vivax TRAP (PvTRAP) in patients from malaria-endemic areas of Iran (n=116), Afghanistan (n=50), and Pakistan (n=50). The PvTRAP gene was expressed in Escherichia coli Rosetta (DE3)-pET23a and used as antigen in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The profile of immunoglobulin G (IgG) isotype and the avidity of IgG, IgG1, and IgG3 to PvTRAP, as well as the association between anti-PvTRAP isotype responses and host age were evaluated. Only 42.24% of Iranian, 38% of Afghani, and 44% of Pakistani patients infected with P. vivax had positive anti-PvTRAP IgG, and the prevalence of responders in the three countries did not differ significantly (P>0.05). Moreover, the prevalence of IgG1 and IgG3 antibody responses to PvTRAP showed no significant correlation with age (P>0.05). Individuals exposed to vivax malaria in the unstable malaria transmission areas are able to produce antibodies to the TRAP antigen at all ages in response to P. vivax infections. Finally, the presence of mature IgG1 and IgG3 antibodies with high to intermediate avidity against PvTRAP antigen (>60%) provide more information to understand the interactions between the host and P. vivax parasite. In summary, the present study provides data that support the rational development of an effective pre-erythrocytic stage vaccine based on PvTRAP antigen.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCulicidae 3aEscherichia coli 3aPlasmodium vivax 3aadhesion 3aantibodies 3aantigens 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3agene expression 3ahepatocytes 3aimmune response 3aimmunoglobulin G 3amalaria 3aparasites 3apatients 3asalivary glands 3asporozoites 3avaccines 3aAfghanistan 3aIran 3aPakistan 0aMalaria 0aPlasmodium vivax 0aTRAP 0aVaccine 0aNaturally acquired antibodies1 aZakeri, Sedigheh1 aMehrizi, Akram Abouie1 aDjadid, Navid Dinparast0 tActa tropica.g2017 Sept., v. 173 p.45-54dElsevier B.V.x0001-706X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.actatropica.2017.05.0263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03780naa a2200697 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100002000171245015700191300001800348520173500366592002802101650001502129650001202144650001902156650002102175650001202196650001402208650001002222650001402232650001802246650002202264650001102286650002502297650001202322650001202334650001202346650001802358650002802376650002502404650002602429650003302455650001502488650001402503650002502517650002402542650002202566650002502588650001402613650002102627650002002648650002402668650002802692650001402720650002702734651001802761651001102779651002502790700002202815700002502837700001802862700002102880773010502901856005503006852000903061655001203070IND4469171620221119212709.0120727e201109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446917162DNAL7 a218514362pmid7 a10.1111/j.1365-294X.2011.05211.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWOOD, DUSTIN A.10aRefugial isolation and divergence in the Narrowheaded Gartersnake species complex (Thamnophis rufipunctatus) as revealed by multilocus DNA sequence data  ap. 3856-3878.  aGlacial–interglacial cycles of the Pleistocene are hypothesized as one of the foremost contributors to biological diversification. This is especially true for cold‐adapted montane species, where range shifts have had a pronounced effect on population‐level divergence. Gartersnakes of the Thamnophis rufipunctatus species complex are restricted to cold headwater streams in the highlands of the Sierra Madre Occidental and southwestern USA. We used coalescent and multilocus phylogenetic approaches to test whether genetic diversification of this montane‐restricted species complex is consistent with two prevailing models of range fluctuation for species affected by Pleistocene climate changes. Our concatenated nuDNA and multilocus species analyses recovered evidence for the persistence of multiple lineages that are restricted geographically, despite a mtDNA signature consistent with either more recent connectivity (and introgression) or recent expansion (and incomplete lineage sorting). Divergence times estimated using a relaxed molecular clock and fossil calibrations fall within the Late Pleistocene, and zero gene flow scenarios among current geographically isolated lineages could not be rejected. These results suggest that increased climate shifts in the Late Pleistocene have driven diversification and current range retraction patterns and that the differences between markers reflect the stochasticity of gene lineages (i.e. ancestral polymorphism) rather than gene flow and introgression. These results have important implications for the conservation of T. rufipunctatus (sensu novo), which is restricted to two drainage systems in the southwestern US and has undergone a recent and dramatic decline.  aPublisher supplied data 3aThamnophis 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3adrainage systems 3afossils 3agene flow 3agenes 3ahighlands 3aintrogression 3amitochondrial DNA 3amodels 3anucleotide sequences 3asorting 3astreams 2aAnimals 2aBase Sequence 2aClimate Changexhistory 2aColubridaexgenetics 2aDNA Primersxgenetics 2aDNA, Mitochondrialxgenetics 2aDemography 2aEcosystem 2aEvolution, Molecular 2aGene Flowxgenetics 2aGenetic Variation 2aGenetics, Population 2aGeography 2aHistory, Ancient 2aModels, Genetic 2aModels, Theoretical 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPhylogeny 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 3aUnited States 0aMexico 0aSouthwestern States.1 aVANDERGAST, A.

Experimental evidence on the effects of production and benefit heterogeneity on collective action  aThough a global phenomenon, climate change will impact different countries to varying degrees. Different countries and industries also vary in how cost effectively they can mitigate climate change. These heterogeneities—one in marginal benefits derived from greenhouse mitigation (“benefit heterogeneity”), the other in marginal productivity in organizing collective action toward greenhouse mitigation (“production heterogeneity”)—have not been sufficiently studied, nor have they been directly compared. The paper tests for the effects of these two heterogeneities in a linear public goods setting, allowing the identification of different drivers of cooperative behavior. We find that heterogeneous assemblies are less able to collectively provide a public good such as greenhouse gas mitigation. Crucially, the type of heterogeneity matters. When there are less-productive mitigators, or when mitigation benefits other actors more than oneself—scenarios that mirror the incentives facing many developed nations—collective action is least effective. Results suggest that emphasizing reciprocity may improve collective action toward mitigation, but this depends on whose behavior is reciprocated. In addition to these empirical findings, the paper advances a methodological innovation. Whereas previous studies manually sorted individuals into contribution groups, which is impractical in larger data sets and yields difficult-to-replicate classifications, this paper uses machine learning to classify players according to their conditional contribution behavior.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimate change 3acollective action 3aecological economics 3agreenhouses 3apollution control 0aPublic goods game 0aHeterogeneity 0aClimate change 0aCollective action 0aReciprocity1 aBower-Bir, Jacob1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4825-98500 tEcological economics.g2021 June, v. 184 p.106998-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11629x0921-80097nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolecon.2021.1069983Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03790naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001900144245014000163300002000303520214200323592002802465650004402493650002202537650003702559650001802596650001402614650002302628650001102651650002402662650001402686650001802700650001302718650003102731650001702762650003302779650001102812650002302823650001702846650003702863650001902900653001802919653001402937653001102951653002702962653002402989700001603013700001603029773012603045856008003171852000903251655001203260IND60579694820221118231733.0170830e20170830xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057969482DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.7b076582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDo, Quoc Cuong10aNonsacrificial Template Synthesis of Magnetic-Based Yolk–Shell Nanostructures for the Removal of Acetaminophen in Fenton-like Systems  ap. 28508-28518.  aRecently, yolk–shell structured materials with active metal cores have received considerable attention in heterogeneous Fenton-like systems, which have excellent catalytic performance. In this study, we initially attempted the nonsacrificial template synthesis of yolk–shell structured nanoparticles with magnetite cores encapsulated in a mesoporous silica shell (Fe₃O₄@SiO₂) via a modified sol–gel process and then evaluated their catalytic activity for acetaminophen degradation in Fenton-like systems. Second, copper nanoparticles were decorated on the surface of the Fe₃O₄@SiO₂ microspheres (Fe₃O₄@SiO₂@Cu) to enhance the catalytic activity. The morphological, structural, and physicochemical properties of the prepared materials were characterized via X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, field emission scanning electron microscopy, field emission transmission electron microscopy, nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms, specific surface area, ζ-potential, magnetic properties, and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. The results demonstrated a successful fabrication of the targeted materials. The yolk–shell structured materials possess a spherical morphology with an active core, protective shell, and hollow void. The Fe₃O₄@SiO₂ and Fe₃O₄@SiO₂@Cu variants showed acetaminophen removal rates significantly higher compared to those of their counterparts, i.e., the Fe₃O₄ and Fe₃O₄@Cu core–shell structures. Fe₃O₄@SiO₂@Cu showed that the copper nanoparticles were firmly immobilized on the mesoporous silica shell, dramatically improving the catalytic performance. Both the yolk–shell structured Fe₃O₄@SiO₂ and Fe₃O₄@SiO₂@Cu exhibited good separation and satisfactory regeneration properties, which could be recycled six times without any obvious decline in catalytic activity. Overall, the results of this study suggested that Fe₃O₄@SiO₂ and Fe₃O₄@SiO₂@Cu yolk–shell nanostructures could be promising catalysts for a heterogeneous Fenton-like system by which the removal of emerging contaminants can be greatly improved.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aacetaminophen 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3acopper 3amagnetic properties 3amagnetite 3ananoparticles 3anitrogen 3aphysicochemical properties 3aporous media 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asilica 3asol-gel processing 3asurface area 3atransmission electron microscopy 3azeta potential 0aacetaminophen 0amagnetite 0acopper 0ayolk−shell structure 0acatalytic oxidation1 aKim, Do-Gun1 aKo, Seok-Oh0 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2017 Aug. 30, v. 9, no. 34 p.28508-28518dAmerican Chemical Societyx1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facsami.7b076583Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02848naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001500150245010200165300001400267520153500281592002801816650001401844650001901858650001801877650003001895650001101925650001201936650001501948650001201963650001101975653003801986653003002024653002602054653003302080653003502113700001302148700002102161700002202182700002002204773009702224856008402321852000902405655001202414IND60603352220221117071633.0180716e201501  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060335222DNAL7 a10.1016/j.powtec.2014.08.0682doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Tong10aInvestigation of bed-to-wall heat transfer characteristics in a rolling circulating fluidized bed  ap. 46-54.  aIn order to enhance the heat recovery properties of the circulating fluidized bed (CFB) which is proposed to be a potential choice for the waste heat recovery system in a ship to solve the corrosion problem, effect of the rolling motion induced by the ship on the bed-to-wall heat transfer characteristics has been investigated. Improved cluster-based models (ICBM), in which the potential dynamic feature change of clusters induced by the rolling motion is considered, have been proposed for the prediction of the heat transfer coefficient in the rolling CFB. The predicted heat transfer coefficients by ICBM were compared with the predicted results of cluster renewal model (CRM) which is applied commonly to the CFB at upright attitude, and evaluated by the measurement results in the heat transfer experiment. As results, the predicted heat transfer coefficient by CRM agrees well with the experimental results in the CFB at upright attitude. However, in the case that the rolling motion is applied, the heat transfer coefficient is extremely under-estimated by CRM. Meanwhile, the predicted heat transfer coefficient by ICBM I, which takes into account the disappearance of the gas layer next to the wall and the increase of the particle volume fraction in clusters due to the rolling motion, is in good accord with the measured heat transfer coefficient in the heat transfer experiments. The dynamic feature changes of the cluster are proposed to be the primary factors for the heat transfer augmentation in the rolling CFB.  aPublisher supplied data 3acorrosion 3afluidized beds 3aheat recovery 3aheat transfer coefficient 3amodels 3apowders 3aprediction 3arolling 3awastes 0aRolling circulating fluidized bed 0aHeat transfer coefficient 0aCluster renewal model 0aImproved cluster-based model 0aDescending velocity of cluster1 aLiu, Kai1 aMurata, Hiroyuki1 aHarumi, Kazuyoshi1 aTakei, Masahiro0 tPowder technology.g2015 Jan., v. 269 p.46-54dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11732x0032-59107nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.powtec.2014.08.0683Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03455naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100002300137245005600160300001600216520230700232592002802539650001302567650001202580650002602592650002102618650002202639650001102661650000902672650001002681650000902691650001802700650001502718650001102733650001302744650001302757650001002770650001802780650001302798650000902811650001302820773009602833856007102929852000903000655001203009IND60518832320221120140517.0160419e198908  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051883232DNAL7 a10.2307/19413562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEdwards, Thomas C.14aThe Ontogeny of Diet Selection in Fledgling Ospreys  ap. 881-896.  aI studied the ontogeny of diet selection in fledgling Ospreys (Pandion haliaetus) in the 1985 and 1986 postfledging periods to (1) determine if young that forage from the same available fish resource base develop similar diets; (2) examine how diet choice is affected by interactions with conspecifics; (3) examine how within— and between—year differences in fish abundance in two different lake habitats (littoral and limnetic zones) affect patterns of diet selection; and (4) compare diet choice of fledglings with adults who simultaneously were feeding on the same resources base. Eight young in 1985 and 14 young in 1986 were color banded and observed throughout the 170—d postfledging period. Dynamics of the available fish resource base, which consisted of sunfish (Lepomis spp.), shad (Dorosoma spp.), and bass (Micropterus salmoides, Morone saxatilis), were also monitored. Fish abundance differed considerably between years, both by habitat and by fish species. The abundance of all fish was decreasing when young fledged in 1985 and increasing in 1986. Individual differences in diet selection were present in both years, with preference for each fish species in each year exhibited by at least one young. In addition, some young of each year exhibited no preference for any fish species, but instead captured fish in relation to their availability in the lake. Preference patterns of individuals remained constant throughout postfledging in both years, although the mean diet of all young shifted in 1985. Individual preference patterns were strongly related to whichever fish species was captured initially. Siblings, who tended to forage together throughout postfledging, had statistically similar diets. Diets of all young in 1985 and 9 of 14 young in 1986 differed from the mean diet of adults. Although diets of adults shifted during postfledging, diets of young remained constant, suggesting that young were less able than adults to respond to fluctuations in fish availability. Adults also preferentially foraged in the lake's littoral zone whereas young did not exhibit any tendency to choose one habitat over the other. It may be that recognition and use of habitat—related differences in fish abundance represent a skill level not yet developed by recently fledged Ospreys.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDorosoma 3aLepomis 3aMicropterus salmoides 3aMorone saxatilis 3aPandion haliaetus 3aadults 3abass 3acolor 3adiet 3aeating habits 3afledglings 3aforage 3aforaging 3ahabitats 3alakes 3alittoral zone 3aontogeny 3ashad 3asiblings0 tEcology.g1989 Aug., v. 70, no. 4 p.881-896dEcological Society of Americax0012-96587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2307/19413563Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03186naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100006400146245009100210300002000301520154500321592002801866650001501894650001901909650002101928650001701949650001201966650001301978650002401991650002402015650001302039650001102052650002202063650001902085650001802104650001702122650002602139650002102165700003002186700002202216700002602238700002302264700005702287700005702344700006302401773013902464856008002603852000902683655001202692IND60752161820220218000000.0211001e20210921xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075216182DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.1c060292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGómez, I.

We report the synthesis of nitrogen-doped GQDs (N-GQDs) from glucose and ethylenediamine, cheap and safe chemicals, using a one-step and fast microwave-assisted hydrothermal method. Our N-GQDs exhibit fluorescence in the entire visible spectral region, which extends to near-ultraviolet and slightly to near-infrared. Since the origin of fluorescence and its relation to the structure and synthesis conditions are not yet fully understood, we also concentrated on the fluorescence mechanism explanation. Structural characterization with steady-state and time-resolved photoluminescence measurements indicated that band-to-band transitions, size effect, and different nitrogen and oxygen functional groups play a role in this multicolor emission. Remarkably, we found for the first time the evidence that directly relates a change in the N-GQD work function to the change in oxygen groups under UV irradiation via ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy. Thus, we confirmed that for λₑₓ ≲ 380 nm, photooxidation processes occurred, which led to chemical modification, thereby lowering the work function in the N-GQDs. The N-GQDs were proved to be highly biocompatible by a cell viability assay using vascular smooth muscle cells. Together with the wide spectral range emission observed in confocal fluorescence imaging, it demonstrated the potential of the N-GQDs for in vitro bioimaging applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3abioimaging 3acell viability 3aethylenediamines 3afluorescence 3aglucose 3agraphene 3ahot water treatment 3amicrowave treatment 3anitrogen 3aoxygen 3aphotoluminescence 3aphotooxidation 3asmooth muscle 3aspectroscopy 3aultraviolet radiation 3aviability assays1 aVázquez Sulleiro, Manuel1 aDolečková, Anna1 aPizúrová, Naděžda1 aMedalová, Jiřina1 aRoy, Rajarshi1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6497-67021 aNečas, David1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7731-84531 aZajíčková, Lenka1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6906-89060 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2021 Sept. 21, v. 125, no. 38 p.21044-21054dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23573x1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.1c060293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03044naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002700113040001800140100002600158245009200184300001600276520142400292592002801716650002101744650002501765650002501790650001701815650001701832650002701849650001101876650001501887650001501902650001601917650001201933650001401945650002201959650002001981650003002001650003202031650003002063650002102093650002902114650002202143650002302165650002402188700001802212700002602230700002302256700001802279700002102297773009002318856007302408852000902481655001202490IND60081069320221119125830.0140815e201408  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008106932DNAL7 a243978562pmid7 a10.1111/tpj.124272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBlancaflor, Elison B.10aN‐Acylethanolamines: lipid metabolites with functions in plant growth and development  ap. 568-583.  aTwenty years ago, N‐acylethanolamines (NAEs) were considered by many lipid chemists to be biological ‘artifacts’ of tissue damage, and were, at best, thought to be minor lipohilic constituents of various organisms. However, that changed dramatically in 1993, when anandamide, an NAE of arachidonic acid (N‐arachidonylethanolamine), was shown to bind to the human cannabinoid receptor (CB1) and activate intracellular signal cascades in mammalian neurons. Now NAEs of various types have been identified in diverse multicellular organisms, in which they display profound biological effects. Although targets of NAEs are still being uncovered, and probably vary among eukaryotic species, there appears to be remarkable conservation of the machinery that metabolizes these bioactive fatty acid conjugates of ethanolamine. This review focuses on the metabolism and functions of NAEs in higher plants, with specific reference to the formation, hydrolysis and oxidation of these potent lipid mediators. The discussion centers mostly on early seedling growth and development, for which NAE metabolism has received the most attention, but also considers other areas of plant development in which NAE metabolism has been implicated. Where appropriate, we indicate cross‐kingdom conservation in NAE metabolic pathways and metabolites, and suggest areas where opportunities for further investigation appear most pressing.  aPublisher supplied data 3aarachidonic acid 3abioactive properties 3abiochemical pathways 3acannabinoids 3aethanolamine 3agrowth and development 3ahumans 3ahydrolysis 3ametabolism 3ametabolites 3aneurons 3aoxidation 3aplant development 3aseedling growth 2aAbscisic Acidxmetabolism 2aAmidohydrolasesxmetabolism 2aEthanolaminesxmetabolism 2aLipid Metabolism 2aLipoxygenasexmetabolism 2aPlant Development 2aPlantsxmetabolism 2aSignal Transduction1 aKilaru, Aruna1 aKeereetaweep, Jantana1 aKhan, Bibi Rafeiza1 aFaure, Lionel1 aChapman, Kent D.0 tplant journal.g2014 Aug., v. 79, no. 4 p.568-583dBlackwell Sciencex0960-74127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/tpj.124273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03253naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002800155245020100183300001400384520142500398592002801823650002001851650001201871650003001883650001301913650002301926650001501949650001501964650000901979650001101988650001701999650001302016650001902029650002302048650001402071650002002085650001102105650001202116653002502128653002502153653005502178653002202233700002002255700002802275700003702303700002802340700003102368700002802399700001802427700001702445700003702462773007802499856008902577852000902666655001202675IND60573315820221121065807.0170724e201709  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057331582DNAL7 a10.1016/j.actatropica.2017.05.0242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTunholi, Victor Menezes10aMolluscicidal potential of Heterorhabditis baujardi (Rhabditida: Heterorhabditidae), strain LPP7, on Lymnaea columella (Gastropoda: Pulmonata): An alternative for biological control of fasciolosis  ap. 23-29.  aThis study elucidated for the first time, under laboratory conditions, the susceptibility of Lymnaea columella to infective juveniles of Heterorhabditis baujardi LPP7. Exposure to the nematodes induced an average mortality rate of 66.66% in the population of L. columella, with the highest values attained from the second week after exposure onward. In addition, all the reproductive parameters analyzed (total number of eggs, number of egg masses, number of eggs laid/snail, embryo hatching rate and content of galactogen stored in the albumen gland) changed as a result of the infection. The results indicate the occurrence of the phenomenon of parasitic castration in L. columella infected by H. baujardi LPP7, probably through depletion of energy reserves such as galactogen, necessary to meet the intense metabolic demands of the nematode’s larval stages. Finally, histopathological analysis demonstrated an intense process of cell disorganization, characterized by the occurrence of granulomatous inflammatory reactions in tissues of exposed snails, induced by the spoliative action of the bacteria/nematode. The results suggest the use of H. baujardi LPP7 as an alternative for biological control of the population of this intermediate host, and thus of the diseases in whose epidemiological chain it participates, especially fasciolosis, in line with the recommendations of the World Health Organization (WHO).  aPublisher supplied data 3aHeterorhabditis 3aLymnaea 3aWorld Health Organization 3abacteria 3abiological control 3acastration 3aegg masses 3aeggs 3aenergy 3afascioliasis 3ahatching 3ahistopathology 3aintermediate hosts 3amortality 3anematode larvae 3asnails 3atissues 0aReproductive biology 0aParasitic castration 0aSnail-entomopathogenic nematode (EPN) relationship 0aMicrobial control1 aLorenzoni, P.O.1 ada Silva, Ygor Henrique1 aTunholi-Alves, Vinícius Menezes1 aBoeloni, Jankerle Neves1 aSilva, Maria Aparecida da,1 aMonteiro, Caio Oliveira1 aPrata, M.C.A.1 aPinheiro, J.1 aMartins, Isabella Vilhena Freire0 tActa tropica.g2017 Sept., v. 173 p.23-29dElsevier B.V.x0001-706X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.actatropica.2017.05.0243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02307naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002700113040001800140100001900158245006200177300001600239500001500255520097300270592002801243650001901271650001301290650002501303650001601328650003101344650001601375650001401391650001801405650001401423650001601437650001701453650001301470650002801483650002401511650002301535650004001558650002401598650002601622653001701648773009001665856007301755852000901828655001201837IND60081069420221119125817.0140815e201408  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008106942DNAL7 a242677462pmid7 a10.1111/tpj.123862doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHavaux, Michel10aCarotenoid oxidation products as stress signals in plants  ap. 597-606.  a2019-12-06  aCarotenoids are known to play important roles in plants as antioxidants, accessory light‐harvesting pigments, and attractants for pollinators and seed dispersers. A new function for carotenoids has recently emerged, which relates to the response of plants to environmental stresses. Reactive oxygen species, especially singlet oxygen, produced in the chloroplasts under stress conditions, can oxidize carotenoids leading to a variety of oxidized products, including aldehydes, ketones, endoperoxides and lactones. Some of those carotenoid derivatives, such as volatile β–cyclocitral, derived from the oxidation of β–carotene, are reactive electrophile species that are bioactive and can induce changes in gene expression leading to acclimation to stress conditions. This review summarizes the current knowledge on the non‐enzymatic oxidation of carotenoids, the bioactivity of the resulting cleavage compounds and their functions as stress signals in plants.  aPublisher supplied data 3asinglet oxygen 3alactones 3abioactive properties 3apollinators 3agene expression regulation 3aacclimation 3aaldehydes 3abeta-carotene 3aoxidation 3aattractants 3achloroplasts 3apigments 2aCarotenoidsxmetabolism 2aOxidation-Reduction 2aPlantsxmetabolism 2aReactive Oxygen Speciesxmetabolism 2aSignal Transduction 2aStress, Physiological 0aantioxidants0 tplant journal.g2014 Aug., v. 79, no. 4 p.597-606dBlackwell Sciencex0960-74127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/tpj.123863Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02265naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002700152245012300179520110000302592002801402650002501430650001601455650002701471650001901498650002901517651001001546653002201556653002301578653001201601653001901613653001001632653001501642700001601657700002001673773010201693856008701795852000901882655001201891IND60730519320221119094428.0211219e202106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073051932DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecolecon.2021.1070102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDe La Maza, Cristóbal10aWelfare analysis of the ecological impacts of electricity production in Chile using the sparse multinomial logit model  aChile has substantially expanded its renewable energy supply over the last 10 years. During this transition, Chileans faced a difficult decision about how to produce electricity, and where production should take place. Such decisions can be informed by discrete choice models, that characterize the welfare impacts of alternative electricity production scenarios on the public as a whole, as well as on subgroups of the population. However, it is difficult to determine subgroup impacts when there are many possible subgroups that could have heterogeneous preferences. We describe an approach that uses a hybrid adaptive sparse multinomial logit model to automatically determine subgroups that have heterogeneous preferences while also producing unbiased estimates. We apply the approach to survey data from 486 heads of household in Santiago, Chile, finding that the sparse multinomial approach fits the data better than the mixed logit model, and that it uncovered 16 interpretable two-way interactions between attributes of electricity production alternatives and respondent characteristics.  aPublisher supplied data 3aecological economics 3aelectricity 3aelectricity generation 3alogit analysis 3arenewable energy sources 3aChile 0aMultinomial logit 0aWillingness-to-pay 0aWelfare 0aAdaptive Lasso 0aChile 0aHydropower1 aDavis, Alex1 aAzevedo, Inês,0 tEcological economics.g2021 June, v. 184 p.107010-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11629x0921-80097nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolecon.2021.1070103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01999naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245015600167520076400323592002801087650001701115650002301132650002301155650001401178650002801192650003001220650002201250650002001272650000801292653001701300653002501317653001201342653002101354653002501375700002001400773010201420856008201522852000901604655001201613IND60674822220221117101839.0200210e20191213xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067482222DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tet.2019.1307342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aThomas, Eric J.10a1,5-Stereocontrol in reactions of 2,4-disubstituted alk-2-enylstannanes with aldehydes; an approach to the stereoselective synthesis of branched triols  a2-(tert-Butyldimethylsilyloxymethyl)-4-(methoxymethoxy)pent-2-enyl(tributyl)stannane is transmetallated by tin(IV) chloride stereoselectively to give a pent-1-en-3-yltin trichloride that reacts with aldehydes with excellent (E)-1,5-syn-stereocontrol, e.g. (3E)-1,5-syn-3-(tert-butyldimethylsilyloxymethyl)-5-(methoxymethoxy)-1-phenylhex-3-en-1-ol was the dominant product with benzaldehyde.

The distribution was assumed to be ideal free. Nine unique situations were examined using all possible combinations of three risk levels and three diet levels, for each sex of guppy separately. Both sex and diet level influenced the effect of predation risk on patch choice. For the females the effect of risk was highest at the intermediate diet level. However, the males exhibited the opposite response: the effect of risk of predation was lowest at the intermediate diet level. A simple equation was then used to predict how much extra food (representing the energetic equivalent of risk) must be added to the risky patch for the guppies to become indifferent to the risk differences between the two types of patches. This manipulation caused a similar number of guppies to use both the risky and safe feeders, reducing or offsetting the influence of risk of predation. However, the male guppies were less influenced by this manipulation than were the females. The different results for the two sexes are consistent with known differences in their life histories, indicating that a knowledge of an animal's life history will often be necessary to understand how it makes trade—offs when choosing were to forage.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPoecilia reticulata 3aanimals 3adiet 3aequations 3afemales 3alife history 3amales 3apredation 3arisk1 aDill, Lawrence M.0 tEcology.g1989 Aug., v. 70, no. 4 p.999-1007dEcological Society of Americax0012-96587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2307/19413683Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02226naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002400155245005100179300001400230520101000244592002801254650001301282650002101295650002801316650002201344650001301366650001501379650003001394650001501424650001001439650001101449650002701460650001401487650001801501653002501519653003101544653002101575653001401596773009501610856009001705852000901795655001201804IND60573315920221121065817.0191231e201808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057331592DNAL7 a10.1016/j.actatropica.2017.06.0292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCacciò, Simone M.,10aMolecular epidemiology of Dientamoeba fragilis  ap. 73-77.  aThe flagellated protozoan Dientamoeba fragilis is one of the most commonly diagnosed parasite of the human gut, with a global distribution. Nevertheless, essential aspects of its biology remain incompletely understood or controversial, most notably life cycle, host range, transmission routes and the ability to cause disease. Molecular epidemiologic studies are also scarce, and limited by the lack of informative genotyping tools. To date, two D. fragilis genotypes (1 and 2) are recognized, with a strong predominance of genotype 1 in both humans and few animal hosts. Recent studies have shown that a very low level of genetic variability characterizes parasite isolates collected in various geographic areas and from both symptomatic and asymptomatic cases. This has raised the hypothesis D. fragilis may be a clonal organism. The recent availability of transcriptome data should greatly assist the development of markers useful to understand genetic diversity of D. fragilis at the population level.  aPublisher supplied data 3aProtozoa 3adigestive system 3aepidemiological studies 3agenetic variation 3agenotype 3agenotyping 3ageographical distribution 3ahost range 3ahosts 3ahumans 3amolecular epidemiology 3aparasites 3atranscriptome 0aDientamoeba fragilis 0aEpidemiology: transmission 0aMolecular typing 0aClonality0 tActa tropica.g2018 Aug., v. 184 p.73-77dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl44799x0001-706X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.actatropica.2017.06.0293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01935naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001600152245008600168300001600254520084000270592002801110650002001138650002701158650001101185650001401196650001401210650000901224651001101233653002501244653003101269653002701300700001401327700002001341700001401361773009101375856008601466852000901552655001201561IND60545921120221117202519.0160903e201401  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054592112DNAL7 a10.1016/j.atmosres.2012.12.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCardoso, I.10aLightning casualty demographics in Brazil and their implications for safety rules  ap. 374-379.  aA 10-year study of lightning fatalities in Brazil is presented.

These structures will result in various porosities and directly impact the performance of the products constructed. It is difficult to image and visualize particle structures from dense powder samples.We have determined particle positions in three-dimensions within toner powders. With these particle positions, a visualization of the particle structure can be reconstructed. The determination of particle positions involves imaging with a confocal laser scanning microscope to capture a stack of cross-sectional images of florescent particles and analyzing the resulting images. The feasibility of imaging sedimented particulate samples by using micron-sized poly-dispersed electrophotographic printing particles has been demonstrated. The XYZ co-ordinates and radii for these particles (which are assumed to be spherical) have been calculated in several selected sampling volumes. Consequently, a size distribution for the particles has also been obtained. The three-dimensional reconstruction of these particles illustrates a highly porous structure. This methodology of three-dimensional particle mapping and visualization can potentially lead to much needed materials and structural analyses for fine particles.  aPublisher supplied data 3aconfocal laser scanning microscopy 3aimage analysis 3amanufacturing 3apowders 0aParticle microstructures 0aParticle analysis 0a3D imaging 0a3D reconstruction 0aConfocal laser scanning microscopy1 aPatil, Vineeth1 aBai, Di1 aEsterman, Marcos0 tPowder technology.g2015 Jan., v. 269 p.1-6dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11732x0032-59107nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.powtec.2014.08.0713Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03797naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002500152245010600177300001600283520248000299592002802779650001202807650002002819650003102839650001402870650002702884651001202911651001102923651001702934653001402951653001902965653001602984653002003000653001803020653002203038700002303060700001903083700001703102700002203119700002403141773009103165856008603256852000903342655001203351IND60545921220221117202529.0160903e201401  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054592122DNAL7 a10.1016/j.atmosres.2012.12.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCampos, Leandro Z.S.10aHigh-speed video observations of natural cloud-to-ground lightning leaders – A statistical analysis  ap. 285-305.  aThe aim of this investigation is to analyze the phenomenology of positive and negative (stepped and dart) leaders observed in natural lightning from digital high-speed video recordings. For that intent we have used four different high-speed cameras operating at frame rates ranging from 1000 or 11,800 frames per second in addition to data from lightning locating systems (BrasilDat and NLDN). All the recordings were GPS time-stamped in order to avoid ambiguities in the analysis, allowing us to estimate the peak current of and the distance to each flash that was detected by one of the lightning locating systems. The data collection was done at different sites in south and southeastern of Brazil, southern Arizona and South Dakota, USA. A total of 62 negative stepped leaders, 76 negative dart leaders and 29 positive leaders were recorded and analyzed. From these data it was possible to calculate the two-dimensional speed of each observed leader, allowing us to obtain its statistical distribution and evaluate whether or not it is related to other characteristics of the associated flash. In the analyzed dataset, the speeds of positive leaders and negative dart leaders follow a lognormal distribution at the 0.05 level (according to the Shapiro–Wilk test). We have also analyzed how the two-dimensional leader speeds change as they approach ground through two different methodologies. The speed of positive leaders showed a clear tendency to increase while negative dart leaders tend to become slower as they approach ground. Negative stepped leaders, on the other hand, can either accelerate as they get closer to ground or present an irregular development (with no clear tendency) throughout their entire development. For all the three leader types no correlation has been found between the return stroke peak current and the average speed of the leader responsible for its initiation. We did find, however, that dart leaders preceded by longer interstroke intervals cannot present speeds of the order of 107ms−1. Finally, we have analyzed the impact of recoil activity during positive leaders over their average speed and the return stroke peak current. Even though the analysis considering the leader speed was not conclusive it was possible to show that there is no apparent minimum or maximum peak current value for return strokes preceded by leaders with or without recoil activity (considering the most common range of values in literature, 20–80kA).  aPublisher supplied data 3acameras 3adata collection 3aglobal positioning systems 3alightning 3alognormal distribution 3aArizona 3aBrazil 3aSouth Dakota 0aLightning 0aStepped leader 0aDart leader 0aPositive leader 0aRecoil leader 0aHigh-speed camera1 aSaba, Marcelo M.F.1 aWarner, Tom A.1 aPinto, Osmar1 aKrider, E.

Molar ratio (oleic acid/phytosterols), temperature, reaction period, organic solvents, catalyst, and silica-gel drier were optimized, and the result showed that 93.4% of the sterols had been esterified under the optimal synthetic condition: the molar ratio of oleic acid/phytosterol is 1:1 in 10 mL iso-octane, immobilized lipase (w, 140% of the sterols), incubated in an orbital shaker (200 rpm) at a temperature of 45 °C for 24 h. The immobilized lipase could be reused for at least 13 times with limited loss of esterification activity. The conversion still maintained up to 86.6%. Hence, this developed process for synthesizing phytosterol esters could be considered as simple and low-energy consumption compared to existing chemical processes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCandida 3acatalysts 3adryers 3aesterification 3aesters 3aoleic acid 3aphytosterols 3asilica gel 3asolvents 3atemperature 3atriacylglycerol lipase1 aChen, Biqiang1 aWang, Juan1 aZhang, Xinzhi1 aZhul, Biyun1 aTan, Tianwei0 tApplied biochemistry and biotechnology.g2012 Sept., v. 168, no. 1 p.68-77dSpringer-Verlagx0273-22897nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12010-011-9324-x  aDNAL 7aarticle02929naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005900148245015400207300001400361520143300375592002801808650001601836650002401852650002901876650002501905650001301930650001301943650001401956650001701970650001801987650001702005650001802022650002302040650003402063650000902097653001802106653001802124653002902142653001302171653001702184700002202201700002102223700001802244773009302262856008302355852000902438655001202447IND60544498120221121172534.0190417e201409  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054449812DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fbio.2014.05.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSaloko, Satrijo1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1282-720310aAntioxidative and antimicrobial activities of liquid smoke nanocapsules using chitosan and maltodextrin and its application on tuna fish preservation  ap. 71-79.  aThe aim of the study was to investigate the antioxidative and antimicrobial activities of liquid smoke (LS) nanocapsules from coconut shell using chitosan and maltodextrin as encapsulants and its application on tuna fish preservation. Nanocapsules were prepared by three variations of chitosan (CS)–maltodextrin (MD) i.e. CS (0.5% w/v) and MD (9.5% w/v) in acetic acid (1.0% v/v), only MD (10% w/v) in LS, and a mixture of CS (1.5% w/v) and MD (8.5% w/v) in LS. The experimental factor of varying nanocapsules concentration 0%; 2.5%; 5.0%; 7.5% and 10% w/w was used to evaluate the antioxidative and antimicrobial activities in fresh tuna fish stored at ambient temperature for 0, 12, 24, 36 and 48h. Fresh tuna minced fish was observed for TVB-N, TPC and sensory evaluation. Results indicated that nanocapsules mixture of CS and MD in LS showed higher value in parameters evaluated i.e. total phenolic, total acid and radical scavenging activity. The addition of nanocapsules prepared of a mixture of CS (1.5% w/v) and MD (8.5% w/v) in LS higher than 5.0% could maintain the fish freshness until 48h at room temperature and had the smallest particle size. Based on sensory evaluation, the score was neither like nor dislike for all nanocapsules concentrations. The results suggested that LS nanocapsule was an effective preservative agent for fresh tuna fish; therefore these nanocapsules are promising for food applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetic acid 3aambient temperature 3aantimicrobial properties 3aantioxidant activity 3achitosan 3acoconuts 3afreshness 3aliquid smoke 3amaltodextrins 3ananocapsules 3aparticle size 3asensory evaluation 3atotal volatile basic nitrogen 3atuna 0aAntioxidative 0aAntimicrobial 0aLiquid-smoke nanocapsule 0aChitosan 0aMaltodextrin1 aDarmadji, Purnama1 aSetiaji, Bambang1 aPranoto, Yudi0 tFood bioscience.g2014 Sept., v. 7 p.71-79dElsevier LtdwJournal:21610x2212-42927nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fbio.2014.05.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02918naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245013200169300001400301520134600315592002801661650001801689650002501707650002501732650001301757650002601770650002301796650003001819650001401849650004401863650002401907650001101931650001601942650001201958650001801970650001301988650001102001650001402012653003602026653001802062653002402080653001402104653001502118700001802133700001902151700001802170773011802188856008502306852000902391655001202400IND60535236020221119221601.0190403e20140917xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053523602DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vetmic.2014.07.0222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWen, Chongqing10aEvaluating the potential of marine Bacteriovorax sp. DA5 as a biocontrol agent against vibriosis in Litopenaeus vannamei larvae  ap. 84-91.  aThe potential application of Bdellovibrio-and-like organisms (BALOs) for the biocontrol of bacterial diseases has been widely recognized. However, no marine BALOs have been reported for Vibrio-related infections in penaeid shrimp. In the present study, the bacteriolytic ability of the marine Bacteriovorax strain DA5 against Vibrio alginolyticus zouA was examined by cocultivation and electron microscopy, and optimal lysis was observed at 30–35°C and 20–30‰ salinity along with a high multiplicity of infection. Then, we showed that experimentally infected Litopenaeus vannamei larvae exhibited significantly higher survival with incremental DA5 levels. Finally, variation in the bacterial counts and the bacterial community in larval rearing water was investigated after prophylactic application of DA5. The elimination effect of DA5 on vibrios was visible at early time points, whereas only a few non-dominant bacteria, rather than the predominant populations, were affected through analysis of denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis of the 16S rDNA V3 region. Accordingly, the prophylactic and therapeutic efficacies of DA5 on vibriosis associated with L. vannamei could markedly enhance larval survivability, and these results will facilitate the application of marine Bacteriovorax to control vibriosis in shrimp larviculture.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacteriovorax 3aLitopenaeus vannamei 3aVibrio alginolyticus 3abacteria 3abacterial communities 3abiological control 3abiological control agents 3acoculture 3adenaturing gradient gel electrophoresis 3aelectron microscopy 3alarvae 3aplate count 3arearing 3aribosomal DNA 3asalinity 3ashrimp 3avibriosis 0aBdellovibrio-and-like organisms 0aBacteriovorax 0aShrimp larviculture 0aVibriosis 0aBiocontrol1 aSiuvai, Ming,1 aLiang, Huafang1 aZhou, Shining0 tVeterinary microbiology.g2014 Sept. 17, v. 173, no. 1-2 p.84-91dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl8205x0378-11357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2014.07.0223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03605naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024002600135040001800161100002500179245018000204300001400384506007600398520166400474592002802138506003702166650001402203650001902217650001802236650002502254650001102279650001502290650000902305650002002314650001502334650001302349650001402362650001202376650001902388650001802407650001402425650001602439650003902455650002802494650001602522650001102538650003002549650002002579650001202599700002302611700002002634700002202654700001702676700001602693700001602709700002402725700001802749700002102767773011902788856003902907852000902946655001202955IND50064645720221207105901.0130405e201301  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006464572DNAL7 a230971302pmid7 aPMC36014322pmcid7 a10.1002/etc.20372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStahl, Ralph G., Jr.14aThe influence of global climate change on the scientific foundations and applications of Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry: Introduction to a SETAC international workshop  ap. 13-19.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThis is the first of seven papers resulting from a Society of Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry (SETAC) international workshop titled “The Influence of Global Climate Change on the Scientific Foundations and Applications of Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry.” The workshop involved 36 scientists from 11 countries and was designed to answer the following question: How will global climate change influence the environmental impacts of chemicals and other stressors and the way we assess and manage them in the environment? While more detail is found in the complete series of articles, some key consensus points are as follows: (1) human actions (including mitigation of and adaptation to impacts of global climate change [GCC]) may have as much influence on the fate and distribution of chemical contaminants as does GCC, and modeled predictions should be interpreted cautiously; (2) climate change can affect the toxicity of chemicals, but chemicals can also affect how organisms acclimate to climate change; (3) effects of GCC may be slow, variable, and difficult to detect, though some populations and communities of high vulnerability may exhibit responses sooner and more dramatically than others; (4) future approaches to human and ecological risk assessments will need to incorporate multiple stressors and cumulative risks considering the wide spectrum of potential impacts stemming from GCC; and (5) baseline/reference conditions for estimating resource injury and restoration/rehabilitation will continually shift due to GCC and represent significant challenges to practitioners.

Most of them infest terrestrial and marine birds, including pigeons, doves, swans, cormorants and penguins. Mallophaga have not been found on marine mammals but only on terrestrial ones, including livestock and pets. Their bites damage cattle, sheep, goats, horses and poultry, causing itch and scratch and arousing phthiriasis and dermatitis. Notably, Mallophaga can vector important parasites, such as the filarial heartworm Sarconema eurycerca. Livestock losses due to chewing lice are often underestimated, maybe because farmers notice the presence of the biting lice only when the infestation is too high. In this review, we examined current knowledge on the various strategies available for Mallophaga control. The effective management of their populations has been obtained through the employ of several synthetic insecticides. However, pesticide overuse led to serious concerns for human health and the environment. Natural enemies of Mallophaga are scarcely studied. Their biological control with predators and parasites has not been explored yet. However, the entomopathogenic fungus Metarhizium anisopliae has been reported as effective in vitro and in vivo experiments against Damalinia bovis infestation on cattle. Furthermore, different Bacillus thuringiensis preparations have been tested against Mallophaga, the most effective were B. thuringiensis var. kurstaki, kenyae and morrisoni. Lastly, plant-borne insecticides have been evaluated against Mallophaga. Tested products mainly contained bioactive principles from two Meliaceae, Azadirachta indica, and Carapa guianensis. High efficacy of neem-borne preparations was reported, leading to the development of several products currently marketed. Overall, our review highlighted that our knowledge about Mallophaga vector activity and control is extremely patchy. Their control still relied on the employ of chemical pesticides widely used to fight other primary pests and vectors of livestock, such as ticks, while the development of eco-friendly control tool is scarce. Behavior-based control of Mallophaga, using pheromone-based lures or even the Sterile Insect Technique (SIT) may also represent a potential route for their control, but our limited knowledge on their behavioral ecology and chemical communication strongly limit any possible approach.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAzadirachta indica 3aBacillus thuringiensis 3aBovicola bovis 3aCarapa guianensis 3aMetarhizium anisopliae 3aPhalacrocorax 3abiological control 3acattle 3achemical communication 3adermatitis 3adoves 3aentomopathogenic fungi 3afarmers 3agoats 3aheartworms 3ahorses 3ahuman health 3ain vivo studies 3ainsecticides 3alice 3amarine mammals 3anatural enemies 3apenguins 3apets 3apigeons 3apoultry 3apredators 3asheep 3asterile insect technique 3aswans 3aticks 3awater birds 0aBird lice 0aBiting lice 0aBiopesticide 0aEco-friendly control 0aPhthiraptera1 aCaselli, Alice1 aDi Giuseppe, Graziano1 aCanale, Angelo0 tActa tropica.g2017, dElsevier B.V.x0001-706X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.actatropica.2017.05.0313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02558naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100005800146245011800204300002000322520101800342592002801360650001901388650001401407650002101421650001501442650001701457650002801474650000701502650002301509650001701532700002201549700002001571700006001591700005701651700001601708700006201724700006101786700006101847773013901908856008002047852000902127655001202136IND60752162420220218000000.0211001e20210917xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075216242DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.1c062652doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWelch, Alex J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2132-961710aOperando Local pH Measurement within Gas Diffusion Electrodes Performing Electrochemical Carbon Dioxide Reduction  ap. 20896-20904.  aThe local pH near the surface of a CO₂ reduction electrocatalyst strongly impacts catalytic selectivity and activity. Here, confocal fluorescence microscopy was used to map the electrolyte pH near a copper gas diffusion electrode during CO₂ reduction with micron spatial resolution in three dimensions. We observed that the local pH increased from pH 6.8 to greater than pH 10 as the current density was increased from 0 to 28 mA/cm² in a 100 mM KHCO₃ electrolyte. Variations in the pH across the surface indicate areas of locally increased activity. Within deep trenches of the active layer, the local pH increases as trench width decreases. Computational models confirm these experimental results and also showed that the catalyst found within narrow trenches is more active than that found at the surface of the electrode. This study suggests that the overpotential required to perform selective CO₂ reduction can be reduced by increasing the density of narrow trench regions in the microporous layer.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon dioxide 3acatalysts 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3aelectrolytes 3afluorescence microscopy 3apH 3aphysical chemistry 3aporous media1 aFenwick, Aidan Q.1 aBöhme, Annette1 aChen, Hsiang-Yun1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6461-15191 aSullivan, Ian1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0632-46071 aLi, Xueqian1 aDuChene, Joseph S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7145-323X1 aXiang, Chengxiang1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1698-67541 aAtwater, Harry A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9435-02010 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2021 Sept. 17, v. 125, no. 38 p.20896-20904dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23573x1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.1c062653Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02685naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100003100171245006000202300001400262520142000276592002801696650001801724650001201742650002001754650002001774650001701794650001101811650001301822650001101835650002101846650001701867650001201884650001201896650002601908650000901934650002001943650003201963650004301995650002802038773010902066856005502175852000902230655001202239IND4470024320221118005136.0120907e201209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447002432DNAL7 a228824292pmid7 a10.1111/j.1463-5224.2012.01054.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPetersen‐Jones, Simon M.10aViral vectors for targeting the canine retina: a review  ap. 29-34.  aClinical trials are currently underway using gene therapy to treat retinal disease such as Leber congenital amaurosis (LCA). Viral vectors that have been utilized to target retinal cells include adenoviruses, lentiviruses, and recombinant adeno‐associated viruses (rAAV). Of the three classes, rAAV vectors show the greatest promise for retinal gene therapy. Recent developments in virus technology such as the development of hybrid and capsid mutant rAAV vectors mean that specific retinal cells can be targeted and faster stronger transgene expression is now possible compared to that achieved with the first generation of vectors. Gene therapy trials in dogs have been very important in the development of therapy for RPE65 LCA which is currently in phase I/II clinical trials in humans. Recent successes in using gene therapy to treat canine achromatopsia, X‐linked progressive retinal atrophy (PRA) and the more severe rapid degenerations such as rod‐cone dysplasia type 3 may lead also to the translation to human clinical trials. Dogs have played and continue to play an important role as animal models for proof‐of‐concept studies of retinal gene therapy. As modifications and improvements in gene therapy protocols are made from experience gathered from human clinical trials perhaps gene therapy for the treatment of canine clinical patients will become available to veterinary ophthalmologists.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal models 3aatrophy 3aclinical trials 3agene expression 3agene therapy 3ahumans 3apatients 3aretina 3aretinal diseases 3atherapy dogs 3aviruses 2aAnimals 2aDog Diseasesxtherapy 2aDogs 2aGenetic Therapy 2aGenetic Vectorsxphysiology 2aRetinal Diseasesxtherapyxveterinary. 2aVirusesxclassification0 tVeterinary ophthalmology.g2012 Sept., v. 15 Suppl s2 p.29-34dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx1463-52167nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1463-5224.2012.01054.x  aDNAL 7aarticle03467naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100002200188245012300210300001800333506007600351520193900427592002802366506003702394650001802431650001302449650002502462650001702487650001002504650002002514650002402534650001702558650000802575650000902583650001002592650001502602700002802617700002802645700002502673700002402698700001802722700003402740700002402774773008502798856008102883852000902964655001202973IND50068449320221207133319.0141112e201309  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006844932DNAL7 a10.1016/j.nut.2013.02.0162doi7 aPMC45148972pmcid7 a238106432pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKaratzi, Kalliopi10aAcute effects of beer on endothelial function and hemodynamics: A single-blind, crossover study in healthy volunteers  ap. 1122-1126.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aOBJECTIVE: Moderate consumption of beer is associated with lower cardiovascular (CV) risk. The goal of this study was to determine the effect of beer consumption on CV risk. To explore the underlying mechanisms, we studied the acute effects of the constituents of beer (alcohol and antioxidants), on established predictors of CV risk: endothelial function, aortic stiffness, pressure wave reflections and aortic pressure. METHODS: In a randomized, single-blind, crossover study, 17 healthy, non-smoking, men (ages 28.5 ± 5.2 y with body mass index 24.4 ± 2.5 kg/m²) consumed on three separate occasions, at least 1 wk apart: 1. 400 mL of beer and 400 mL water, 2. 800 mL of dealcoholized beer (same amount of polyphenols as in the 400 mL of beer), and 3. 67 mL of vodka and 733 mL water (same amount of alcohol as in the 400 mL of beer). Each time aortic stiffness (pulse wave velocity), pressure wave reflections (AΙx), aortic and brachial pressure (Sphygmocor device), and endothelial function (brachial flow mediated dilatation) were assessed at fast and 1 and 2 h postprandial. RESULTS: Aortic stiffness was significantly and similarly reduced by all three interventions. However, endothelial function was significantly improved only after beer consumption (average 1.33%, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.15–2.53). Although wave reflections were significantly reduced by all three interventions (average of beer: 9.1%, dealcoholized beer: 2.8%, vodka 8.5%, all CI within limits of significance), the reduction was higher after beer consumption compared with dealcoholized beer (P = 0.018). Pulse pressure amplification (i.e., brachial/aortic) was increased by all three test drinks. CONCLUSIONS: Beer acutely improves parameters of arterial function and structure, in healthy non-smokers. This benefit seems to be mediated by the additive or synergistic effects of alcohol and antioxidants and merits further investigation.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aacute effects 3aalcohols 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3abeers 3abody mass index 3aconfidence interval 3ahemodynamics 3amen 3arisk 3avodka 3avolunteers1 aRontoyanni, Victoria G.1 aProtogerou, Athanase D.1 aGeorgoulia, Aggeliki1 aXenos, Konstantinos1 aChrysou, John1 aSfikakis, P.

Ultrasound (US) is an attractive and efficient non-thermal technology that could regulate the growth, physiological metabolism and kill pathogens of sprouts.This review presents the effects of ultrasound on the growth, bioactive compounds, antioxidant capacity and microbiological quality of sprouts, and the underlying mechanisms were discussed. Further studies of the effects of US on nutritional quality and microbiological quality of sprouts were also investigated.US can promote the growth of root and hypocotyl, raise the germination percentage of seeds, and finally boost yields of sprouts. In addition, US can promote the breakdown of starch, protein and lipids, and accumulate bioactive compounds, especially phenolic compounds and GABA, in sprouts. The antioxidant capacity is also significantly increased by the action of US on sprouts. Furthermore, US can kill less than 2 log CFU/g of the foodborne pathogens, such as Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella and Escherichia coli, but the combined treatment of US and other technology could even result in complete inactivation of pathogens on seeds and sprouts. Therefore, US is an efficient and promising strategy to be used in sprouts industry.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aListeria monocytogenes 3aSalmonella 3aantioxidant activity 3agermination 3ahypocotyls 3aindustry 3ametabolism 3amicrobiological quality 3anutritive value 3astarch 3atechnology 3aultrasonics 3avegetables 0aSprouts 0aNonthermal methods 0aUltrasound 0aBioactive compounds 0aGrowth 0aMicrobiological quality1 aLi, Zhenhua,1 aZhang, Xiaowei,1 aLiu, Yunpeng,1 aHu, JianGuo1 aYang, CongWei1 aZhao, Xiaoyan,0 tTrends in food science & technology.g2021 May, v. 111 p.292-300dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl45707x0924-22447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tifs.2021.02.0653Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02739naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001400164245017200178300001800350520105500368592002801423650002201451650001401473650000901487650001001496650001001506650002501516650001401541650001501555650001201570650001401582650001101596650001201607650001201619650003201631650002101663650003601684650002701720650001001747650005601757650002601813650001401839650002701853650003401880651001001914651001001924700002701934700001401961700001301975700001701988773009902005856004802104852000902152655001202161IND4469608020221118004956.0121003e201204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446960802DNAL7 a219129612pmid7 a10.1007/s00436-011-2629-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Yang10aMyxobolus honghuensis n. sp.

By optimizing H₂O₂ amount and addition time, the intracellular ROS level was increased, and VAL-A production titer was enhanced by 40% on day 4 when 25μM H₂O₂ was added at 8thh of fermentation. Addition of diphenyleneiodonium chloride (ROS inhibitor) reduced the H₂O₂ induction effect. The transcription level of eight VAL-A structure genes was enhanced by ROS, and activities of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase and ValG enzyme were increased while glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase activity was inhibited. This work demonstrated that ROS induction was a useful strategy for VAL-A fermentation, and the information on gene transcription and enzyme activities may be helpful to further understanding the mechanism of ROS effect on the antibiotic biosynthesis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aglyceraldehyde 3-phosphate 3afermentation 3abiosynthesis 3aNADP-glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase 3aantibiotics 3areactive oxygen species 3achlorides 3aStreptomyces hygroscopicus 3agenes 3aenzyme activity 0aglucose-6-phosphate 1-dehydrogenase1 aBai, Linquan1 aDeng, Zixin1 aZhong, J.-J.q(Jian-Jiang),0 tBioresource technology.g2011 Jan., v. 102, no. 2 p.1783-1787dElsevier Ltdx0960-85247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2010.08.1143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02825naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002900147245012700176300001600303520124100319592002801560596007001588596003901658650001201697650001701709650002201726650001401748650002001762650002701782650001701809650001101826650001901837650002101856650001901877650001401896650001101910650003701921650000901958650001701967700002201984700001702006700002202023700002102045700005902066773011502125856008202240852000902322655001202331IND60595025620221121214614.0190314e201806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059502562DNAL7 a10.1007/s10086-018-1696-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNguyễn, Thành Đức,10aShrinkage and swelling behavior of archaeological waterlogged wood preserved with slightly crosslinked sodium polyacrylate  ap. 294-300.  aIn this article, the conservation of archaeological waterlogged wood (WW) of Afzelia sp. (medium degraded: Uₘₐₓ = 385%) was impregnated in vacuum with an aqueous solution of acrylic acid (AA), sodium acrylate monomer (AANa), crosslinking agent (MBA) and catalyst (V-501). The simultaneous in situ polymerization and crosslinking resulted in slightly crosslinked sodium polyacrylate (PAANa) in the wood structure. The results showed that untreated WW had only a very limited ability to re-swell to recover its original dimensions from a collapsed condition, while WW protected by crosslinked PAANa could almost fully recover its original shape and size even after several drying–rewetting cycles. From microscopic observations, treated wood was found to maintain its original cell structure, form and shape even after repeated drying–rewetting cycles. PAANa was observed to be densely localized near the middle lamella, the cell corners, and the cell lumina by transmission electron microscopy observation. These observations suggest that our PAANa treatment provides reasonable strength as well as favorable hydrophilicity to avoid hornification of the cell wall upon drying, thus providing unique shape recovery properties.  aPublisher supplied data  aGrant Number 25252033cJapan Society for the Promotion of Science  a2017-M5-ivcRISH, Kyoto University 3aAfzelia 3aacrylic acid 3aaqueous solutions 3acatalysts 3acell structures 3across-linking reagents 3acrosslinking 3adrying 3ahydrophilicity 3apolyacrylic acid 3apolymerization 3ashrinkage 3asodium 3atransmission electron microscopy 3awood 3awood anatomy1 aSakakibara, Keita1 aImai, Tomoya1 aTsujii, Yoshinobu1 aKohdzuma, Yohsei1 aSugiyama, Junji1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5388-49250 tJournal of wood science.g2018 June, v. 64, no. 3 p.294-300dSpringer JapanwJournal:jnl56734x1435-02117nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10086-018-1696-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02305naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001500150245010700165300001600272520106500288592002801353650001601381650001101397650001401408650001201422650001501434650001601449653003401465653002501499653003201524653001501556653002401571700001701595700001401612700001701626700001501643700001401658700001901672773009901691856008401790852000901874655001201883IND60603353220221117070958.0180716e201501  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060335322DNAL7 a10.1016/j.powtec.2014.09.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSun, Liyan10aPrediction of configurational and granular temperatures of particles using DEM in reciprocating grates  ap. 495-504.  aThe configurational temperature and granular temperature of particles are simulated by means of discrete element method (DEM) in the reciprocating grate. Motion of mono-sized particles in the reciprocating grate is predicted with the change of frequency and amplitude of moveable grates. The distributions of velocity and volume fraction of particles are obtained. The granular temperature and configurational temperature of particles are calculated from simulated instantaneous velocities and overlaps of particles in a reciprocating grate. The simulated results show that the granular temperatures of particles increase, reach maximum, and then decrease with the increase of solids volume fractions. While the configurational temperature of particles is monotonously increased with the increase of solids volume fraction, indicating that the rate of energy dissipation contributes by deformation of elastic particles at high solids volume fraction. The influence of amplitude and frequency on granular temperature and configurational temperature is analyzed.  aPublisher supplied data 3adeformation 3aenergy 3aequipment 3apowders 3aprediction 3atemperature 0aDEM (discrete element method) 0aGranular temperature 0aConfigurational temperature 0aSimulation 0aReciprocating grate1 aWang, Shuyan1 aLu, Huang1 aLiu, Goudong1 aLu, Huilin1 aLiu, Yang1 aZhao, Feixiang0 tPowder technology.g2015 Jan., v. 269 p.495-504dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11732x0032-59107nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.powtec.2014.09.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02789naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001900146245017200165300002000337520176800357592002802125650002202153650002302175650001602198700001702214700005202231773013902283856008002422852000902502655001202511IND60752162820221118043725.0211001e20210915xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075216282DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.1c063942doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiao, Mengling10aRole of Trap States in Excitation Wavelength-Dependent Photoluminescence of Strongly Quantum-Confined All-Inorganic CsPbBr₃ Perovskites with Varying Dimensionalities  ap. 21062-21069.  aAll-inorganic CsPbBr₃ perovskites have emerged as promising luminescent materials for light-emitting devices owing to their unprecedented photoluminescence (PL) properties. The fundamental understanding of their photophysical properties offers new opportunities to develop high-performance devices. However, the investigation of optical properties of strongly quantum-confined CsPbBr₃ perovskites of different morphologies is lacking. Herein, we report the PL properties of strongly quantum-confined CsPbBr₃ perovskites with varying dimensionalities, specifically zero-dimensional quantum dots (0D-QDs), one-dimensional quantum wires (1D-QWs), and two-dimensional quantum platelets (2D-QPLs). Results reveal that the PL efficiency displays an overall increase for 0D-QDs and 1D-QWs but a negligible change for 2D-QPLs against the excitation wavelength, all with the observation of multiple local minima. A combined analysis of the excitation wavelength dependence of the PL efficiency, dimensionality dependence of excitonic transition, and time-resolved PL decays implies the presence of two different types of trap states—a continuum of electron trap states and discrete localized trap states. We conclude that both trap states are equally important in both 0D-QDs and 1D-QWs, while discrete localized trap states are dominant in 2D-QPLs. In all these quantum structures, the two trap states do not affect the intrinsic exciton relaxation but could interact with energetically excited electrons beyond the conduction band minimum, thereby decreasing the PL efficiency. Our study presents a fundamental understanding of the PL properties of quantum-confined CsPbBr₃ perovskites and may guide the development of the corresponding light-emitting devices.  aPublisher supplied data 3aphotoluminescence 3aphysical chemistry 3awavelengths1 aShan, Beibei1 aLi, Ming1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2289-02220 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2021 Sept. 15, v. 125, no. 38 p.21062-21069dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23573x1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.1c063943Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03191naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100001700171245008400188300001600272520141000288592002801698650002301726650003101749650002401780650001301804650001201817650001401829650001401843650002401857650001301881650003901894650004801933650003301981650003302014650004202047650003802089650002902127650003402156650001302190650001402203650001902217650005602236650001602292650003502308650002802343700001802371700001402389700001702403700001802420700001402438773009702452856005502549852000902604655001202613IND4478410420221119212421.0120727e201202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447841042DNAL7 a219673232pmid7 a10.1111/j.1365-313X.2011.04799.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGou, Mingyue14aThe F‐box protein CPR1/CPR30 negatively regulates R protein SNC1 accumulation  ap. 411-420.  aDisease resistance (R) proteins, as central regulators of plant immunity, are tightly regulated for effective defense responses and to prevent constitutive defense activation under non‐pathogenic conditions. Here we report the identification of an F‐box protein CPR1/CPR30 as a negative regulator of an R protein SNC1 likely through SCF (Skp1‐cullin‐F‐box) mediated protein degradation. The cpr1‐2 (cpr30‐1) loss‐of‐function mutant has constitutive defense responses, and it interacts synergistically with a gain‐of function mutant snc1‐1 and a bon1‐1 mutant where SNC1 is upregulated. The loss of SNC1 function suppresses the mutant phenotypes of cpr1‐2 and cpr1‐2 bon1‐1, while overexpression of CPR1 rescues mutant phenotypes of both bon1‐1 and snc1‐1. Furthermore, the amount of SNC1 protein is upregulated in the cpr1‐2 mutant and down‐regulated when CPR1 is overexpressed. The regulation of SNC1 by CPR1 is dependent on the 26S proteosome as a protease inhibitor MG132 stabilizes SNC1 and reverses the effect of CPR1 on SNC1. Interestingly, CPR1 is induced after infection of both virulent and avirulent pathogens similarly to the other negative defense regulator BON1. Thus, this study reveals a new mechanism in R protein regulation likely through protein degradation and suggests negative regulation as a critical component in fine control of plant immunity.  aPublisher supplied data 3adisease resistance 3agene expression regulation 3agene overexpression 3aimmunity 3amutants 3apathogens 3aphenotype 3aprotein degradation 3aproteins 2aArabidopsisxgeneticsximmunology. 2aArabidopsis Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aCarrier Proteinsxmetabolism 2aDisease Resistancexgenetics 2aF-Box Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plant 2aLeupeptinsxpharmacology 2aMembrane Proteinsxmetabolism 2aMutation 2aPhenotype 2aPlant Immunity 2aPlants, Genetically Modifiedxgeneticsximmunology. 2aProteolysis 2aTobaccoxgeneticsximmunology. 2aTransformation, Genetic1 aShi, Zhenying1 aZhu, Ying1 aBao, Zhilong1 aWang, Guoying1 aHua, Jian0 tplant journal.g2012 Feb., v. 69, no. 3 p.411-420dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0960-74127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-313X.2011.04799.x  aDNAL 7aarticle02280naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002000145245010800165300001400273520102600287650001901313650001801332650001301350650002101363650003801384650001701422653000901439653001701448653001901465700002901484700002101513700003101534700002701565700003301592773011701625852000901742856008501751930003301836946001301869655001201882IND4438853720221122230844.0100619e201003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443885372DNAL7 a10.1007/s10924-009-0153-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGrillo, Renato 10aCharacterization of Atrazine-Loaded Biodegradable Poly(Hydroxybutyrate-Co-Hydroxyvalerate) Microspheres  ap. 26-32.  aPolyhydroxybutyrate-co-hydroxyvalerate microspheres (PHBV-MS) were prepared as a delivery system for the herbicide atrazine (ATZ). Characterization of the system included investigation of in vitro release properties and genotoxicity. ATZ − PHBV-MS particle diameters showed a size distribution range of 1-13 μm. Differential scanning calorimetry analyses indicated that ATZ was associated with the PHBV microparticles. The release profiles showed a different release behavior for the pure herbicide in solution, as compared with that containing ATZ-loaded PHBV-MS. Korsmeyer-Peppas model analyses showed that atrazine release from the microparticles occurred by a combination of diffusion through the matrix and partial diffusion through water-filled pores of the PHBV microparticles. A Lactuca sativa test result showed that the genotoxicity of ATZ-loaded PHBV-MP was decreased in relation to ATZ alone. The results demonstrate a viable biodegradable herbicide release system using atrazine for agrochemical purposes. 3aLactuca sativa 3aagrochemicals 3aatrazine 3abiodegradability 3adifferential scanning calorimetry 3agenotoxicity 0aPHBV 0aMicrospheres 0aRelease system1 ade Melo, Nathalie F.

This was achieved by developing a Rhizobium FAME library using 16 different Rhizobium strains of Rh. leguminosarum bv. viceae (n = 5), Rh. leguminosarum bv. phaseoli (n = 5), Rh. leguminosarum bv. trifolii (n = 1) and Rhizobium sp.

Blood samples were analysed at inclusion, after 4-6 and after 9-11 days. Results: In group E, serum alpha-tocopherol doubled from 11.4 +/- 6.9 at inclusion to 20.9 +/- 7.9 and to 23.8 +/- 8.8 microgram/ml after 4 and 9 days, respectively, but did not change in group C (P = 0.008). Production of thiobarbituric acid-reacting substances (TBARS) after 120 min incubation with copper decreased from 66 +/- 34 at inclusion to 29 +/- 25 nmol MDA/mg LDL and VLDL-cholesterol after 4 and to 42 +/- 17 after 9 days (P = 0.022 when compared to group C, which underwent no significant changes). Velocity of production of fluorescent products decreased in group E but not in group C (P = 0.026). Conclusions: Supplementation of TPN containing MCT/LCT with 100 mg DL-alpha-tocopherol/day leads to a doubling in serum alpha-tocopherol and to a decrease in the susceptibility of LDL and VLDL to peroxidation in vitro. 3apatients 3aintravenous injection 3adietary supplements 3aalpha-tocopherol 3atriacylglycerols 3ablood chemistry 3alow density lipoprotein 3aduration 2aAdolescent 2aAdult 2aAged 2aAged, 80 and over 2aDouble-Blind Method 2aFat Emulsions, Intravenousxchemistry 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aLipid Peroxidationxdrug effects 2aMale 2aMiddle Aged 2aParenteral Nutrition, Total 2aThiobarbituric Acid Reactive Substancesxmetabolism 2aTriglyceridesxadministration & dosagexchemistry. 2aalpha-Tocopherolxadministration & dosagexblood. 0aparenteral administration1 aNonneman, L.1 aBosscher, H. de.1 aVertommen, J.1 aSchrans, S.1 aKlutsch, K.1 aLeeuw, I. de.0 tEuropean journal of clinical nutrition.g2002 Feb., v. 56, no. 2 p.121-128x0954-30077nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1038/sj.ejcn.16012943Available from publisher's Web site  a20021002b20021010c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle04433naa a2200697 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003300111040001800144100002300162245014600185300001800331520237800349650000802727650002002735650002302755650001802778650001402796650001402810650002002824650001302844650000802857650001602865650001702881650001102898650001402909650001902923650001502942650001002957650002502967650005402992650002503046650004103071650001903112650001103131650001503142650000903157650001603166650002303182650003203205650002003237650005603257650002103313650002103334651001503355653001403370653001403384653001503398700002503413700001403438773009903452852000903551856008303560930003303643945001303676946001103689990002303700655001203723IND2324720520221122090318.0020104e200111  uk |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232472052DNAL7 a116417532pmid7 a10.1038/sj.ejcn.16012632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNazrul Islam, S.K.10aSerum vitamin E, C and A status of the drug addicts undergoing detoxification: influence of drug habit, sexual practice and lifestyle factors  ap. 1022-1027.  aBackground: The study was carried out on the hypothesis that drug addicts would have reduced vitamin E, C and A status which could be influenced by drug habit, sexual practice and lifestyle factors. Method: Serum concentrations of Vitamin E, C and A of male drug addicts and cohort controls were analysed, and influence of drug habit, sexual practice and lifestyle factors of the addicts on the vitamin status was assessed. The study was conducted among 253 drug addicts who sought detoxification voluntarily during the period of June 1997 to July 1998 at the Central Drug Addiction Treatment Hospital, Dhaka, and 100 cohort control men. Research instruments were questionnaire and blood specimens. HPLC and spectrophotometric methods were used to determine the vitamin levels in sera of drug addicts. Results: alpha-Tocopherol (12.60 +/- 3.73 compared with 16.3 +/- 3.37 micromol/l; t = 8.6, P = 0.05), ascorbic acid (21.59 +/- 10.5 compared with 38.3 +/- 13.62 micromol/l; t = 10.93, P = 0.003) and retinol (1.15 +/- 0.39 compared with 1.33 +/- 0.30 micromol/l; t = 5.28, P = 0.048) in the drug addicts were significantly low as compared to those in the cohort controls. Use of multiple illicit drugs for a longer period of time did result in reduced levels of these vitamins. A significant reduction in retinol concentration was noted among the multiple drug users (F(2,250) = 3.23, P = 0.041). Duration of addiction had a significant linear correlation with the level of reduction in retinol (F(2,250) = 3.23, P = 0.041) and alpha-tocopherol (F(2,250) = 3.06, P = 0.049). Apart from having a significant negative correlation between number of sexual partners and retinol level (F(3,247) = 2.65, P = 0.049), sexual practice did not have any influence on the vitamin status of the addicts. Occupation did have a significant effect on the ascorbic acid level (F(4,248) = 2.46, P = 0.046), but other socioeconomic factors like income, age etc did not influence the vitamin E, C and A levels. Body mass index had a positive linear correlation with the vitamins, but it was significant only with vitamin C (F(2,250) = 7.06, P = 0.001). Conclusions: These results could have important implications for providing an antioxidant therapy to drug addicts and thus rehabilitating them into normal life. Risk of HIV infection and transmission (if any) could be reduced or inhibited. 3amen 3ablood chemistry 3anutritional status 3aascorbic acid 3avitamin A 3avitamin E 3asexual behavior 3aduration 3aage 3abody weight 3adrug therapy 3aincome 3alifestyle 3asocioeconomics 2aAdolescent 2aAdult 2aAscorbic Acidxblood 2aAvitaminosisxdrug therapyxprevention & control. 2aCase-Control Studies 2aChromatography, High Pressure Liquid 2aCohort Studies 2aHumans 2aLife Style 2aMale 2aMiddle Aged 2aNutritional Status 2aSurveys and Questionnaires. 2aSexual Behavior 2aSubstance-Related Disordersxbloodxrehabilitation. 2aVitamin Axblood 2aVitamin Exblood 3aBangladesh 0aaddiction 0atreatment 0adrug users1 aJahangir Hossain, K.1 aAhsan, M.0 tEuropean journal of clinical nutrition.g2001 Nov., v. 55, no. 11 p.1022-1027x0954-30077nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1038/sj.ejcn.16012633Available from publisher's Web site  a20020301b20020307c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle02808naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024003500110040001800145100001700163245010500180300001600285500001500301520127700316650000901593650001201602650001001614650000901624650001701633650002301650650001601673650001201689650002101701650000901722650001901731650001201750650002201762650001101784650001301795650002301808650001901831650002101850650001901871650002301890650002001913650001001933651001201943651001201955653000901967700002001976773008301996852000902079856008502088930003302173945001302206946001102219655001202230IND2046473220221122061905.0950616e199407  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204647322DNAL7 a79581112pmid7 a10.1080/026520394093742432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTahvonen, R.10aLead and cadmium contents in pork, beef and chicken, and in pig and cow liver in Finland during 1991  ap. 415-426.  a2019-12-04  aNationally representative samples of pork, beef, chicken, and pig's and cow's liver were collected from slaughterhouses and pooled to represent the collection area of each slaughterhouse. The lead (Pb) and cadmium (Cd) contents of the freeze-dried samples were analysed after wet digestion in concentrated HNO3 using ETAAS (Varian Spectra AA 400), Zeeman background correction and (NH4)H2PO4 as the matrix modifier. A strict analytical quality control programme including reference materials and recovery tests was employed. The average Pb content of beef (tenderloin) was 10 microgram/kg, ground beef 8 microgram/kg, cow's liver 37 microgram/kg, pork (regular loin) 9 microgram/kg, pig's liver 11 microgram/kg and chicken 6 microgram/kg. The mean Cd contents of beef, pork and chicken were lower than the limit of detection of the method employed. The mean Cd content of cow's liver was 66 microgram/kg (cow) and 36 microgram/kg (heifer) and that of pig's liver 21 microgram/kg. The contents of lead and cadmium were low in all samples studied, approximately the same level or lower than those found in earlier Finnish studies. These results are in good agreement with the earlier Finnish Market Basket Study in which very low average lead and cadmium intakes were found. 3apork 3aheifers 3aloins 3alead 3achicken meat 3afood contamination 3aground beef 3acadmium 3afood composition 3acows 3alivers as food 2aAnimals 2aCadmiumxanalysis 2aCattle 2aChickens 2aFood Contamination 2aLeadxanalysis 2aLiverxchemistry 2aMeatxanalysis 2aMusclesxchemistry 2aQuality Control 2aSwine 3aFinland 0aFinland 0abeef1 aKumpulainen, J.0 tFood additives & contaminants.g1994 , v. 11, no. 4 p.415-426x0265-203X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/026520394093742433Available from publisher's Web site  a19950703b19950711c00000000  aINDdHBI  aNon-US 7aarticle02837naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001700129245011800146300001600264500002400280500001500304520122700319650001501546650002101561650001301582650001001595650001601605650001301621650002801634650003001662650002801692650001301720650001201733650001001745650001501755650002701770650002801797650001601825650001301841650004801854650001301902650003101915650002201946653001001968700001701978700001101995700001402006700001402020700001302034700002002047700001702067700002002084700002002104773011402124852000902238655001202247IND4373246620221122040406.0050812e200405  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437324662DNAL7 a150732202pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDownie, A.B.12aA physical, enzymatic, and genetic characterization of perturbations in the seeds of the brownseed tomato mutants  ap. 961-973.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe brownseed mutants (bs1, bs2, and bs4) of tomato all possess dark testae and deleteriously affect seed germination speed and/or final percentage. Poor germination performance of the bs1 but not the bs4 mutant, was due to greater impediment to radicle egress. Testa toughening (bs1) was prevented by drying in N2. However, poor germination speed was hardly affected by drying. GA(4+7) did not ameliorate germination percentage or speed (bs1, bs2), whereas bs4 seeds commenced radicle protrusion sooner and had a greater germination percentage. bs1 mutant seeds have two times more catalase activity while those of bs4 contained six times more peroxidase and almost two times more catalase activity than WTs. bs4 release only half of the reactive oxygen species into the media than WT during imbibition. EPR detected the presence of free radicals in bs1 and its WT. bs mutants were epistatic to 12 anthocyaninless mutations, at least some of which produce seeds of lighter than usual testa colour. Macro-arrays of subtractive, suppressive PCR products identified differentially regulated transcripts between seeds of bs4 and WT. EST identity suggests bs4 does not exit the developmental programme upon attaining maturity. 3aimbibition 3aseed germination 3atomatoes 3atesta 3asowing date 3acatalase 3areactive oxygen species 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aexpressed sequence tags 3amutation 3amutants 3acolor 3aperoxidase 2aAnthocyaninsxgenetics 2aExpressed Sequence Tags 2aGermination 2aKinetics 2aSolanum lycopersicumxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aMutation 2aNucleic Acid Hybridization 2aSeedsxphysiology 0aseeds1 aDirk, L.M.A.1 aXu, Q.1 aDrake, J.1 aZhang, D.1 aDutt, M.1 aButterfield, A.1 aGeneve, R.R.1 aCorum, J.W.

  1 aMartini, L.10aHemodynamic indices versus gastric tonometric measurements for prognosis of hemorrhagic shock: a porcine model  ap. 178-185.  aThe aim of the study reported here was to assess the prognostic value of gastric tonometry and its implications in the initial phases of hemorrhagic shock. Hemorrhagic shock was induced by use of femoral arterial bleeding in 12 hybrid swine under general anesthesia. Approximately 30% of the circulating blood volume was removed, until mean arterial pressure of 45 mmHg was reached. The shock conditions were observed over a limited period (90 min) by comparing traditional hemodynamic parameters with gastric tonometric measurements and tissue oxygenation. After a shock period of 90 min without pharmacologic treatment, blood was collected in acid-citrate dextrosetreated bags and was reinfused via the right femoral vein. At the end of the experiment, seven animals had good hemodynamic recovery on reinfusion (group A), whereas values in five animals deceased in the same phase (group B). Hemodynamic and gastric tonometric results were compared between survivors and nonsurvivors. Intravascular volume restoration and reduction of systemic vascular resistance (SVR) enabled the animals of group A to maintain standard ventricular kinetics and recover in terms of splanchnic regional flow. In addition, increase in intramucosal gastric pH (pHi), decrease in the pH-gap (pHa - Hi), and progressive restoration in gastric wall tissue oxygenation (PtO(2)) also were observed. These results suggest that useful diagnostic and therapeutic indications can be obtained by acquisition of simple hemodynamic measurements at the beginning of the shock period. On the basis of results of statistical analysis, only mean arterial pressure and SVR were good indicators of shock development, whereas pHi was not a significant factor in this experimental model. 3aswine 3alaboratory animals 3aanimal models 3ahypovolemic shock 3ahemorrhage 3ablood pressure 3ablood volume 3agastric mucosa 3apH 3ablood flow 3aoxygen consumption 3aflow resistance 3asplanchnic tissues 3aischemia 3aprognosis 2aAnimals 2aBlood Pressure 2aBlood Volume 2aDisease Models, Animal 2aFemale 2aGastric Mucosaxmetabolism 2aHemodynamics 2aHydrogen-Ion Concentration 2aManometry 2aOximetry 2aOxygenxanalysis 2aPrognosis 2aRegional Blood Flow 2aShock, Hemorrhagicxpathologyxphysiopathology. 2aSplanchnic Circulation 2aStomachxphysiopathology 2aSwine 0aregional blood flow1 aGiavaresi, G.1 aFini, M.1 aFaenza, S.1 aPetrini, F.1 aGiardino, R.0 tComparative medicine.g2003 Apr., v. 53, no. 2 p.178-185x1532-08207nnas  aDNAL  a20040830b20040901c00000000  aINDdJITe2004/08/09  aOther US 7aarticle02850naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111072001700129072001700146100002000163245006800183300001600251500001500267520122500282650001901507650002501526650001201551650002701563650001701590650001301607650002001620650001401640650001301654650002201667650004001689650005201729650002701781650001201808650001101820650001201831650006401843650003701907650006101944650001602005653001302021653001202034700001702046700002002063700001702083700001402100773007802114852000902192930003302201945002502234946001302259655001202272IND4363297320221122040434.0040712e200304  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436329732DNAL7 a127848572pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Androstenedione and 17-hydroxyprogesterone, but not estradiol, concentrations were high in both ferrets. Following surgical resection of the abnormal tissue in one ferret, the high hormone values decreased quickly and hair regrowth ensued. In both cases, histologic examination revealed features consistent with classical sex cord-stromal (gonadostromal) tumors: prominent spindle cells, along with polyhedral epithelial cells and cells with vacuolated cytoplasm. Although similar cell types have been described in the adrenal glands of ferrets with adrenal-associated endocrinopathy, an ovarian origin for the current neoplasms is considered likely on the basis of their anatomic location; accessory adrenal tissue has only been described close to an adrenal gland or in the cranial perirenal fat of ferrets. Immunohistochemical analysis, using an antibody against Mullerian-inhibiting substance, failed to prove definitively the source of the steroidogenic cells. 3amicrostructure 3aimmunohistochemistry 3aferrets 3aadrenal gland diseases 3aprogesterone 3aexcision 3aandrostenedione 3aestradiol 3aalopecia 3aovarian neoplasms 2a17-alpha-Hydroxyprogesteronexblood 2aAlopeciaxcomplicationsxpathologyxveterinary. 2aAndrostenedionexblood 2aAnimals 2aFemale 2aFerrets 2aGranulosa Cell Tumorxcomplicationsxpathologyxveterinary. 2aImmunohistochemistryxveterinary 2aOvarian Neoplasmsxcomplicationsxpathologyxveterinary. 2aOvariectomy 0asymptoms 0aovaries1 aRogers, A.B.1 aSchrenzel, M.D.1 aMarini, R.P.1 aFox, J.G.0 tComparative medicine.g2003 Apr., v. 53, no. 2 p.213-217x1532-08207nnas  aDNAL  a20040928b20041003c00000000  aINDdJITe2004/08/09  aOther US 7aarticle01694naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002800145245017600173300001800349500002400367520062400391650001401015650001201029650001501041650001901056650000901075650002701084650001901111700002301130700002001153700002301173773010301196852000901299856004801308655001201356IND4422180720221122005416.0090619e200908  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442218072DNAL7 a10.1007/s10592-008-9681-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 ade Ponte Machado, Marta10aDevelopment and characterization of microsatellite loci from the Great White Pelican (Pelecanus onocrotalus) and widespread application to other members of the Pelecanidae  ap. 1033-1036.  aIncludes references  aWe describe the isolation of 10 microsatellite loci from the Great White Pelican using an enrichment protocol.

We characterized three lily (Lilium longiflorum) SKP1-like genes, LSK1-LSK3, that are specifically expressed in late pollen developmental stages and the elongating pollen tube. The encoded peptide sequences reveal that LSK1-LSK3 share high identity with Arabidopsis ASK1 and contain a putative N-terminal CUL1- and a C-terminal F-box-interacting domain. Yeast two-hybrid and in vitro affinity binding assays revealed that the LSKs associate with lily CULLIN1. In addition, the LSK genes can functionally complement the yeast skp1 deletion mutant YDR328C. To investigate their biological functions in pollen tube elongation, an in vivo approach for green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged dominant-negative LSK1-LSK3 was developed. Microprojectile bombardment with N-terminally truncated LSK1-LSK3 (LSK1-LSK3Δ-GFP) significantly retarded pollen tube elongation in both in vitro germination and in vivo self- and cross-pollination after >12 h incubation. Interestingly, elongation of pollen tubes harboring overexpressed LSK2Δ-GFP and LSK3Δ-GFP was substantially inhibited within the self-pollinated styles. The elongation of most LSK2Δ-GFP-transformed pollen tubes could germinate only on the stigmatic surface of self style and showed statistically significant growth arrest as compared with control pollen tubes. Lily exhibits typical gametophytic self-incompatibility via an unknown mechanism, but LSK2 and LSK3 may be involved in this complex machinery. These results suggest critical roles for LSK1-LSK3 in regulating fundamental pollen tube elongation in vitro and in vivo and that the 26S proteasome-mediated protein pathway plays an important role in pollen tube elongation. 3aArabidopsis 3aLilium longiflorum 3abiochemical pathways 3across pollination 3agametophytes 3agenes 3agreen fluorescent protein 3aplant fertility 3apollen 3apollen tubes 3aproteasome endopeptidase complex 3aself-pollination 3aselfing 3asequence homology 3aubiquitin-protein ligase 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aCloning, Molecular 2aDNA, Complementaryxgenetics 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plant 2aGenetic Complementation Test 2aLiliumxgeneticsxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPlant Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aPollen Tubexgeneticsxgrowth & development. 2aRNA, Plantxgenetics 2aSaccharomyces cerevisiaexgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aSequence Alignment 2aTwo-Hybrid System Techniques1 aGuo, Cian-Ling1 aLin, Yun-Shan1 aFu, Hongyong1 aWang, Co-Shing1 aJauh, Guang-Yuh0 tPlant & cell physiology.g2009 Aug., v. 50, no. 8 p.1558-1572dOxford University Pressx0032-07817nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/pcp/pcp1003Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02656naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127100001800144245010000162300001600262520141400278650000901692650002301701650001801724650003301742650002101775650002301796650001401819650002501833650001801858650001701876650001901893650002601912653001301938700002401951700001801975700001301993700001602006700001802022773007802040852000902118930003302127945002502160946001302185655001202198IND4362340520221121224257.0040504e200312  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436234052DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aGografe, S.I.10aMouse model of Sanfilippo syndrome type B: relation to phenotypic features to background strain  ap. 622-632.  aSanfilippo syndrome type B or mucopolysaccharidosis type III B (MPS IIIB) is a lysosomal storage disorder that is inherited in autosomal recessive manner. It is characterized by systemic heparan sulfate accumulation in lysosomes due to deficiency of the enzyme a-N-acetylglucosaminidase (Naglu). Devastating clinical abnormalities with severe central nervous system involvement and somatic disease lead to premature death. A mouse model of Sanfilippo syndrome type B was created by targeted disruption of the gene encoding Naglu, providing a powerful tool for understanding pathogenesis and developing novel therapeutic strategies. However, the JAX GEMM Strain B6.129S6-Naglu(tm1Efn) mouse, although showing biochemical similarities to humans with Sanfilippo syndrome, exhibits aging and behavioral differences. We observed idiosyncrasies, such as skeletal dysmorphism, hydrocephalus, ocular abnormalities, organomegaly, growth retardation, and anomalies of the integument, in our breeding colony of Naglu mutant mice and determined that several of them were at least partially related to the background strain C57BL/6. These background strain abnormalities, therefore, potentially mimic or overlap signs of the induced syndrome in our mice. Our observations may prove useful in studies of Naglu mutant mice. The necessity for distinguishing background anomalies from signs of the modeled disease is apparent. 3amice 3alaboratory animals 3aanimal models 3ainherited metabolic diseases 3aknockout mutants 3astrain differences 3aphenotype 3aabnormal development 3ahydrocephalus 3ahomozygosity 3aheterozygosity 3amucopolysaccharidosis 0asymptoms1 aGarbuzova-Davis, S.1 aWilling, A.E.1 aHaas, K.1 aChamizo, W.1 aSanberg, P.R.0 tComparative medicine.g2003 Dec., v. 53, no. 6 p.622-632x1532-08207nnas  aDNAL  a20040830b20040901c00000000  aINDdJITe2004/08/17  aOther US 7aarticle02334naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024003500110040001800145100001800163245011600181300001600297520084600313650002001159650002401179650001801203650002301221650004301244650001201287650003001299650004101329650001801370650001801388650002301406650001001429650001801439650002101457650001901478650003101497650003201528653001601560700001801576700001201594773008301606852000901689856008501698930003301783945001301816946001101829655001201840IND2047638020221121224141.0950907e199501  enk||||jo|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204763802DNAL7 a77586242pmid7 a10.1080/026520395093742842doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChevalier, M.10aDetermination of chloramphenicol residues by reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography in foies gras  ap. 101-106.  aA reverse phase liquid chromatographic (LC) method for the determination of chloramphenicol (CAP) residues in foies gras was tested.

  1 aSerfilippi, L.M.10aAssessment of retinal degeneration in outbred albino mice  ap. 69-76.  aEvaluation of a pharmaceutical's safety includes assessment of the potential for ophthalmologic toxicity. These nonclinical studies commonly use various outbred stocks of mice. Pretest indirect ophthalmoscopic examinations in the commonly used outbred stock Hsd:ICR(CD-1) indicated that retinal degeneration was a problem in this particular outbred stock of mice. This prompted the authors to examine other stocks of outbred mice routinely used in the performance of nonclinical safety studies. Groups of mice were observed over a 13-week period to determine the progression and changing incidence of retinal degeneration. Light intensity in the room and caging was measured during the study, and it was determined that light did not play a direct role in the progression of the retinal degeneration observed during the study. Histomorphologic examination of the mouse eyes was performed at the end of the study to confirm the presence of retinal degeneration observed after ophthalmoscopic examination. The incidence of retinal atrophy in the various outbred stocks of mice was: Crl:CFW(SW)BR (98.3%), Tac(SW)fBR (80%), Tac:Icr:Ha(ICR)fBR (75%), Hsd:ICR(CD-1) (43.3%), and Crl:CF-1BR (3.0%). Retinal atrophy was not observed in the following outbred mice stocks: Crl:CD-1(ICR)BR, HsdWin:CFW1, and Hsd:NSA(CF-1). On the basis of these findings, it is highly recommended that pretest ophthalmologic screening be performed on mice to obviate pre-existing conditions from confounding or invalidating nonclinical study results. 3alaboratory animals 3aretina 3aatrophy 3astrain differences 3ahistology 3ahistopathology 3agenetic disorders 2aAnimals 2aAnimals, Outbred Strains 2aEyexpathology 2aFemale 2aIncidence 2aMale 2aMice 2aOphthalmoscopyxveterinary 2aRetinal Degenerationxepidemiologyxpathologyxveterinary. 2aRodent Diseasesxepidemiologyxpathology. 2aSpecies Specificity 0aUnited Statesxepidemiology.1 aPallman, D.R.S.1 aGruebbel, M.M.1 aKern, T.J.1 aSpainhour, C.B.0 tComparative medicine.g2004 Feb., v. 54, no. 1 p.69-76x1532-08207nnas  aDNAL  a20041117b20041201c00000000  aINDdJITe2004/11/17  aOther US 7aarticle03292naa a2200661 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111072001700129100001600146245008700162300001600249500001500265520144100280650001201721650002101733650001901754650001801773650002301791650001201814650002401826650001901850650001701869650001201886650002101898650002201919650001001941650001201951650004101963650004302004650002402047650003302071650001102104650006502115650003102180650001902211650002102230650001202251653001902263653002202282653001602304653001202320653002402332700001802356700001702374700001802391700001702409700001902426700001502445773007802460852000902538930003302547945002502580946001302605655001202618IND4362343520221120110857.0040504e200312  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436234352DNAL7 a147278152pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aBrady, A.G.10aStudies of heart disease and failure in aged female squirrel monkeys (Saimiri sp.)  ap. 657-662.  a2019-12-05  aLesions consistent with heart failure were found in 23 of 88 adult squirrel monkeys that died between 1995 and 1999 at the Squirrel Monkey Breeding and Research Resource (SMBRR). This provided a rationale for a study surveying aged animals in the SMBRR for normal cardiac characteristics, using echocardiography (ECHO) and electro-cardiogram. In the pilot study, ECHO and electrocardiography were performed on 59 healthy female squirrel monkeys aged 10 years or older and 39 five-year-old monkeys. Parameters were heart rate, P-wave duration and amplitude, and PR, QRS, and QT intervals (electrocardiography), and ejection fraction. Two animals with cardiomyopathy were identified and received similar testing. Advanced-study animals had the same measurements, plus left ventricular internal diameter-systole (LVIDs) and -diastole (LVIDd), left atrial diameter-diastole (LADd) and aortic root diameter-diastole (AoRDd) by use of ECHO. Significant differences were found between groups in LADd, and P-wave and QRS interval durations. In a clinical context, these differences were not considered to be substantial. Normal aged female squirrel monkeys had significant increases in heart dimension and longer P- and QRS-wave durations than did monkeys of a five-year-old control group, although the increases were not considered clinically relevant. This study documents myocardial dynamics in healthy saimiri and those with cardiomyopathy. 3aelderly 3aSaimiri sciureus 3acardiomyopathy 3anormal values 3alaboratory animals 3amonkeys 3aelectrocardiography 3acardiac output 3acase studies 3afemales 3aechocardiography 3adisease diagnosis 2aAging 2aAnimals 2aCardiomegalyxpathologyxveterinary. 2aCardiovascular Physiological Phenomena 2aDisease Progression 2aEchocardiographyxveterinary 2aFemale 2aHeart Failurexphysiopathologyxultrasonographyxveterinary. 2aMonkey Diseasesxpathology 2aPilot Projects 2aReference Values 2aSaimiri 0aheart diseases 0aejection fraction 0aold animals 0aSaimiri 0aSaimiri boliviensis1 aWatford, J.W.1 aMassey, C.V.1 aRodning, K.J.1 aGibson, S.V.1 aWilliams, L.E.1 aAbee, C.R.0 tComparative medicine.g2003 Dec., v. 53, no. 6 p.657-662x1532-08207nnas  aDNAL  a20040831b20040901c00000000  aINDdJITe2004/08/18  aOther US 7aarticle01419naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004400092040001800136100001300154245008300167300001600250520040000266650001400666650001700680650001600697650002100713650001000734650000800744650002300752650001900775700001800794773009700812852000900909856009400918930003301012945001301045946001101058655001201069IND2059927520221121201250.0970926e199506  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205992752DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-277X.1995.tb00312.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWise, A.14aThe relationship between individual beliefs and portion weights of fat spreads  ap. 193-199.  aSubjects were approached in a supermarket and asked to identify, from a circular table, which of 10 possible amounts of margarine spread on bread they would consume at home.

In the work presented a systematic study has been undertaken on the stability of five selected commercial plastics additives (Irganox 3114, Irganox 1035, Irganox 245, Irganox 1098 and Irgafos P-EPQ) in the three EU-official aqueous food simulants (distilled water, 3% aq. acetic acid and 15% aq. ethanol) and in an alternative fat simulant (95% aq. ethanol) under two different time/temperature exposure conditions (10 days at 40 degrees C and 1 h at 100 degrees C). To enable quantitative analysis of the additives for this investigation, a simple and rapid HPLC method with UV detection was developed. The results obtained showed that the four Irganox-type additives under investigation were practically stable under the applied exposure conditions in all of the employed food simulants. Only Irganox 3114 exhibited a relatively low degree of instability in the ethanolic food simulants. Concerning Irgafos P-EPQ, a mixture of at least seven constituents, a remarkable degradation in ethanol and acetic acid solutions was observed. The developed HPLC method is also considered to be applicable for stability testing of other Irganox-type additives both in aqueous and fatty food simulants. 3aacetic acid 3asimulation models 3apackaging materials 3afood analysis 3adetection 3afood contamination 3afood packaging 3arapid methods 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3aEuropean Union 3aplastics 3awater 3aduration 3aenvironmental exposure 3atemperature 3aultraviolet radiation 3aethanol 3aantioxidants 3aadditives 0astability 0apolymers1 aFranz, R.0 tFood additives & contaminants.g1998 Jan., v. 15, no. 1 p.93-99x0265-203X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/026520398093746033Available from publisher's Web site  a19981201b19981208c00000000  aINDdHBI  aNon-US 7aarticle02161naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004800092040001800140100001800158245008800176300001600264500001500280520085100295650002101146650001001167650001201177650000801189650001201197650001801209650002501227650001901252650001401271650001201285650001901297650002301316650002201339653001301361653001501374653001201389653001201401700001701413773009701430852000901527856009801536930003301634945001301667946001101680655001201691IND2059853820221121170735.0970924e199612  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205985382DNAL7 a10.1046/j.1365-277X.1996.t01-1-00441.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKilgallen, I.10aParental perception of food allergy or intolerance in children under 4 years of age  ap. 473-478.  a2019-12-04  aThe perceived prevalence of food allergy among parents of preschoo1 children in Ireland is unknown. An interview-assisted questionnaire was used to interview the parents of 600 children, aged 0-4 years, about food allergy. Twelve and a half per cent of the children were perceived by their parents to be food allergic. However, no instance of food allergy in children aged under 6 months was reported. Hyperactivity was the most common symptom noted, with sweets, sugary drinks and food colours being the most frequently implicated foods. Rash, the second most common symptom cited was largely associated with dairy products and eggs. Neither parental age, education, socio-economic groups or infant feeding practices affected perception of food allergy. Food allergy was diagnosed primarily by the parents themselves using simple food avoidance. 3afood intolerance 3afoods 3amothers 3aage 3asurveys 3afood coloring 3asocioeconomic status 3ainfant feeding 3aeducation 3ainfants 3afood allergies 3apreschool children 3adisease diagnosis 0asymptoms 0aperception 0aparents 0asources1 aGibney, M.J.0 tJournal of human nutrition and dietetics.g1996 Dec., v. 9, no. 6 p.473-478x0952-38717nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-277X.1996.t01-1-00441.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a19971102b19971106c00000000  aINDdHBI  aNon-US 7aarticle01761naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001900152245009200171300001600263500018100279520051100460650002100971650002400992650002301016650002601039650002401065650001301089650001301102650001501115653001401130773009701144852000901241856009201250930003301342945001301375946001101388655001201399IND2059877320221121170732.0970925e199610  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205987732DNAL7 a10.1046/j.1365-277X.1996.00473.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMerriman, S.H.10aNutrition education in the treatment of eating disorders: a suggested 10 session course  ap. 377-380.  aIn the special issue: Diamond Jubilee Conference Issue / edited by M.

The estimation of menthol in Pan Masala samples involves steam distillation followed by reaction with p-dimethyl amino benzaldehyde (DMAB) in acidic medium to give a red colour which is read at 550 nm. The sensitivity of this procedure is 75 microgram menthol per g sample. Using this method, 130 branded and 53 non-branded samples of Pan Masala were analysed for menthol content. Almost 25% of branded samples contained less than 1 mg menthol per g while 75% of samples contained 1.1-6.5 mg menthol per g Pan Masala. Non-branded Pan Masala contained 1 mg menthol per g in only 7.6% of samples. However, 92% of samples contained 1.1-6.5 mg menthol per g, suggesting that the addition of menthol is relatively higher in non-branded Pan Masala samples than in branded ones. 3amethanol 3atraditional foods 3aflavorings 3afood analysis 3aestimation 2aArecaxchemistry 2aFood Contamination 2aHumans 2aMentholxanalysisxisolation & purification. 2aPlants, Medicinal 2aSpectrophotometry 3aIndia 0arecovery1 aDas, M.1 aKhanna, S.K.0 tFood additives & contaminants.g1997 , v. 14, no. 4 p.367-371x0265-203X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/026520397093745393Available from publisher's Web site  a19980702b19980709c00000000  aINDdHBI  aNon-US 7aarticle01881naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001700152245005900169300001600228500018100244520056200425650002400987650002301011650002401034650001601058650002001074650002101094650002101115650001501136653001601151653001301167653002001180653002801200773009701228852000901325856009201334930003301426945001301459946001101472655001201483IND2059876820221121170748.0970925e199610  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205987682DNAL7 a10.1046/j.1365-277X.1996.00475.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPassmore, S.10aNutrition education in schools--educating the children  ap. 357-362.  aIn the special issue: Diamond Jubilee Conference Issue / edited by M.

Adolescents were interviewed on their recall of food intake over the previous 24 h. The results showed a very low consumption of vegetables, some deficiencies in the intake of the milk and fruits, and an excessive intake of fats. Intake of foods belonging to the cereal and meat groups was adequate, agreeing with the recommendations for the adolescent population. Within the meat group, the distribution of foods consumed was not satisfactory; an excessive consumption of meats and sausages was observed, while the intake of fish and pulses was insufficient in our study, nutritional advice was given to mothers and adolescents. The use of Spanish portions from the six basic food groups proved to be a very helpful method to popularize the principles of balanced diet in our population. Our results seem to indicate some nutritional imbalances in the diets of the adolescents in the study, especially deficits in fibre and calcium and an excess in saturated fats. The study reveals that although Murcia is a typically Mediterranean Region, the characteristics of the diet of Murcian adolescents are quite different in some respects from the typical alimentary habits of the Mediterranean diet. 3anutrient intake 3aestimation 3aportion size 3aeating habits 3aschool children 3afood groups 3anutritional adequacy 3aadolescents 3adietary surveys 3aSpain 0afood intake 0adiet1 aGaraulet, M.1 aNieto, M.1 aBaraza, J.C.1 aZamora, S.0 tJournal of human nutrition and dietetics.g1996 Dec., v. 9, no. 6 p.463-471x0952-38717nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-277X.1996.00479.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a19971102b19971106c00000000  aINDdHBI  aNon-US 7aarticle03195naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001500152245009700167300001600264520201400280650002002294650001102314650002402325650001902349650002402368650002302392650001902415650001502434650002702449653001502476653001302491653002402504700001402528773009702542852000902639856009202648930003302740945001302773946001102786655001202797IND2059384520221121131706.0970904e199604  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205938452DNAL7 a10.1046/j.1365-277X.1996.00445.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCadman, L.10aNutrition advice in primary care: evaluation of practice nurse nutrition training programmes  ap. 147-156.  aPrimary health care teams (PHCT), including the practice nurse (PN), now have a significant role in health promotion in the UK, which includes the dissemination of advice relating to food and health. However, reports suggest there is a lack of nutritional knowledge among PHCT members and/or problems in communicating dietary advice effectively. Dorset Healthcare Trust employs two full-time primary care dietitians (PCDs). Their remit is to provide training in the field of nutrition to members of the PHCT, primarily PNs, in order to facilitate their role in delivering effective and consistent healthy eating advice. This small research study was designed to evaluate the impact of nutrition training from a primary care dietitian on the attitudes, practice and knowledge of practice nurses. There have been few studies or reports documenting this, which highlighted the need to evaluate the practice nurse training programmes in Dorset. Five practices of varying size were included in the study. Evaluation was undertaken by means of semi-structured interviews with one practice nurse from each practice conducted before and after training. In addition a questionnaire was used as a tool to assess perceived nutrition knowledge and confidence when giving dietary advice. True/ false statements and a case history formed part of the questionnaire which was completed both pre- and post-training. Three 1-h training sessions covering the topics of obesity, diabetes mellitus and coronary heart disease were planned. They were presented by the primary care dietitian to each practice nurse together with other members of their PHCT over a 3-month period. The primary care dietitian collected feedback on each training session in order to monitor teaching methods and presentation skills. The study suggests that dietitian-led training sessions are well received by PNs and can have an impact on increasing or updating practice nurses' knowledge about diet, particularly where their initial knowledge was low. 3adiet counseling 3anurses 3anutrition education 3ahuman behavior 3anutrition knowledge 3aprogram evaluation 3aquestionnaires 3aguidelines 3aattitudes and opinions 0aperception 0atraining 0aprimary health care1 aWiles, R.0 tJournal of human nutrition and dietetics.g1996 Apr., v. 9, no. 2 p.147-156x0952-38717nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-277X.1996.00445.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a19971001b19971008c00000000  aINDdHBI  aNon-US 7aarticle02290naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024003500110040001800145100001700163245010500180300001400285520092900299650002301228650002401251650001501275650001501290650001601305650001901321650002401340650001801364650001401382650002301396650001901419650001101438650002401449650001301473650001601486700001701502700001701519700001701536700001901553773008501572852000901657856008501666930003301751945001301784946001101797655001201808IND2123584020221121131658.0980623e199701  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND212358402DNAL7 a90595842pmid7 a10.1080/026520397093744982doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLickly, T.D.10aUsing a simple diffusion model to predict residual monomer migration: considerations and limitations  ap. 65-74.  aA simple mathematical equation based on a diffusion model has been utilized recently to estimate migration of both acrylonitrile and styrene from polymers produced from these monomers which are used under a wide variety of food-contact applications. These calculated migration values have subsequently been used to estimate the US consumer's exposure to acrylonitrile and styrene from food stored in these materials. The basic assumptions integral to the model are discussed in relation to potential errors in migration estimates that could be experienced if the assumptions are not true. In addition to the discussion of the basic assumptions, factors affecting the migration predictions such as polymer 'ageing', temperature changes during the lifetime of the polymeric article, the effects of polymer-modifying materials (plasticizers, impact modifiers), and the physical form of the article or test sample are discussed. 3afood contamination 3amathematical models 3aestimation 3aprediction 3atemperature 3afood packaging 3apackaging materials 2aAcrylonitrile 2aDiffusion 2aFood Contamination 2aFood Packaging 2aHumans 2aModels, Theoretical 2aStyrenes 2aTemperature1 aRainey, M.L.1 aBurger, L.C.1 aBreder, C.V.1 aBorodinsky, L.0 tFood additives & contaminants.g1997 Jan., v. 14, no. 1 p.65-74x0265-203X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/026520397093744983Available from publisher's Web site  a19980801b19980807c00000000  aINDdHBI  aNon-US 7aarticle01956naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024003500110040001800145100001700163245006800180300001400248520076300262650002301025650001901048650002201067650001301089650001301102650001401115650001701129650004101146650002301187650001901210650001101229650002301240650001601263700001901279773008501298852000901383856008501392930003301477945001301510946001101523655001201534IND2123583920221121102653.0980623e199701  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND212358392DNAL7 a90595832pmid7 a10.1080/026520397093744972doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRiquet, A.M.10aFood and packaging interactions: tailoring fatty food simulants  ap. 53-63.  aMigration of paramagnetic probes from rigid PVC within 24 h at 50 degrees C depends on the simulant to a considerable extent. With a strongly swelling simulant like tert-butyl acetate, the rate of diffusion is governed by the rate of penetration of the medium into the polymeric network. Isooctane has a very weak interaction with rigid PVC. With a mixture of tert-butyl acetate and isooctane it is possible to adjust the aggressivity of the medium and to tailor an alternative simulant that interacts with the polymer in the same fashion as the EU's official fatty food simulants. Particular responses of polar probes underline the importance of the interaction between simulant and additives in the choice of alternative fatty food simulants for rigid PVC. 3afood contamination 3afood packaging 3asimulation models 3akinetics 3asorption 3adiffusion 2aDietary Fats 2aElectron Spin Resonance Spectroscopy 2aFood Contamination 2aFood Packaging 2aHumans 2aPolyvinyl Chloride 2aSpin Labels1 aFeigenbaum, A.0 tFood additives & contaminants.g1997 Jan., v. 14, no. 1 p.53-63x0265-203X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/026520397093744973Available from publisher's Web site  a19980801b19980807c00000000  aINDdHBI  aNon-US 7aarticle02810naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004400092040001800136100001500154245012300169300001600292500001500308520137600323650002001699650001901719650001201738650001601750650002101766650002301787650001801810650002001828650001801848650002501866650002301891650001301914650001301927650002001940650002101960650001501981653001601996700001302012700001402025700002002039773009702059852000902156856009402165930003302259945001302292946001102305655001202316IND2059382620221121102627.0970904e199508  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205938262DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-277X.1995.tb00317.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFenton, J.14aThe nutritional implications of food wastage in continuing care wards for elderly patients with mental health problems  ap. 239-248.  a2019-12-04  aLong-stay wards, where patients are permanently resident, have a responsibility to ensure that the diet that they provide is adequate to meet their residents' needs. The diets of long-stay, elderly patients with mental health problems were assessed and compared with dietary reference values. The nutritional value of the food supplied from the kitchen and the ward, the food served to the patient and the food consumed by the patient was evaluated. Results showed that food wastage, as service losses and plate waste, had nutritional implications. In the cases of vitamin C, riboflavin, vitamin B6, vitamin A, calcium, iron, copper, zinc and total energy, the amounts available to patients were adequate. After service losses and plate waste however, intakes were found to be low. In other cases the food available would not have supplied adequate amounts of the nutrients, even if no losses had occurred (folate, vitamin D, magnesium, potassium, iodine, selenium and dietary fibre). Actual intakes of some nutrients, notably heat labile vitamins, may be lower than recorded owing to the effects of catering practices (e.g. warm-holding). Low intakes usually resulted from a combination of service losses and plate waste. Plate waste occurred for a number of reasons, including inappropriate eating utensils, unfamiliar or disliked foods and insufficient time for meals. 3anutrient intake 3along term care 3aelderly 3afood intake 3anutrient content 3anutritional status 3aenergy intake 3adietary protein 3adietary fiber 3anutritional adequacy 3abehavior disorders 3avitamins 3apatients 3adietary surveys 3adietary minerals 3afood waste 0afood wastes1 aEves, A.1 aKipps, M.1 aO'Donnell, C.C.0 tJournal of human nutrition and dietetics.g1995 Aug., v. 8, no. 4 p.239-248x0952-38717nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-277X.1995.tb00317.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a19971001b19971008c00000000  aINDdHBI  aNon-US 7aarticle02927naa a2200625 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024003500110040001800145100002000163245016400183300001600347520111400363650001001477650001001487650001201497650001701509650001601526650001101542650001301553650002201566650002001588650002301608650002101631650000901652650001801661650001901679650001201698650002801710650001101738650002901749650002001778650002301798650002201821650001901843650002401862650003101886650001901917650000901936650002501945650001001970653001201980653001301992653002802005700001802033773008702051852000902138856008502147930003302232945001302265946001102278655001202289IND2123609420221121102618.0980624e199707  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND212360942DNAL7 a93285362pmid7 a10.1080/026520397093745582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMcCracken, R.J.14aThe bioavailability of residues of the furazolidone metabolite 3-amino-2-oxazolidinone in porcine tissues and the effect of cooking upon residue concentrations  ap. 507-513.  aResidues of furazolidone in pig tissues have previously been shown to be bioavailable in the rat. However, no specific furazolidone metabolite has been identified in the tissues of a second species. Tissues were taken from pigs that had been treated therapeutically with furazolidone, lyophilized and then fed to female Sprague Dawley rats for 3 days. Protein-bound and solvent-extractable residues containing the side chain metabolite 3-amino-2-oxazolidinone (AOZ) were detected in the liver, kidney and muscle of the rats using HPLC-thermospray mass spectrometry. Furazolidone-contaminated pig tissues which had undergone solvent extraction and thereby contained only bound residues, was fed to two rats. Bound and extractable AOZ was detected in liver, kidney and muscle. Since it is most likely that consumers would eat animal tissue which had been cooked, an experiment was carried out to determine the effects of cooking upon the concentrations of AOZ residues in pig tissues. Total AOZ concentrations were not significantly reduced in liver, kidney or muscle, following frying, grilling or microwaving. 3aswine 3aliver 3akidneys 3afurazolidone 3ametabolites 3afrying 3agrilling 3amicrowave cooking 3abioavailability 3afood contamination 3afood composition 3arats 3aanimal models 3amuscle tissues 2aAnimals 2aBiological Availability 2aFemale 2aFurazolidonexmetabolism 2aHot Temperature 2aKidneyxmetabolism 2aLiverxmetabolism 2aMeatxanalysis 2aMusclesxmetabolism 2aOxazolesxpharmacokinetics 2aOxazolidinones 2aRats 2aRats, Sprague-Dawley 2aSwine 0abinding 0aresidues 0a3-amino-2-oxazolidinone1 aKennedy, D.G.0 tFood additives & contaminants.g1997 July, v. 14, no. 5 p.507-513x0265-203X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/026520397093745583Available from publisher's Web site  a19980801b19980807c00000000  aINDdHBI  aNon-US 7aarticle03005naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024003500110040001800145100001700163245013200180300001600312520139600328650000901724650001201733650001401745650001901759650001601778650001601794650001501810650001001825650001301835650001801848650004301866650001801909650001301927650004101940650001801981650002401999650002502023650002402048653001302072653001502085653002302100653001802123653002302141653003002164700001902194773008702213852000902300856008502309930003302394945001302427946001102440655001202451IND2123607720221121102642.0980624e199707  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND212360772DNAL7 a93285272pmid7 a10.1080/026520397093745492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLauren, D.R.10aDetermination of the fate of three Fusarium mycotoxins through wet-milling of maize using an improved HPLC analytical technique  ap. 435-443.  aThe fate of three Fusarium mycotoxins, nivalenol (NIV), deoxynivalenol (DON) and zearalenone (ZEN), all common contaminants in New Zealand grown maize, has been measured in fractions of maize after passage through a commercial wet-milling plant. Distribution of the three toxins follows a pattern reasonably expected from their physical solubility characteristics. The highly water-soluble mycotoxins, NIV and DON, were found at high concentrations (up to 8.8mg/kg) in concentrated steep liquor (CSL) fractions, but are low levels (less than 0.3mg/kg) in the solid (germ, fibre and gluten) fractions. The converse was true for ZEN, which is relatively insoluble in water. For ZEN, the maximum concentration found in CSL was 0.6 mg/kg compared with 2.2-4.8 mg/kg in germ, fibre and gluten fractions. Accordingly, an animal food byproduct composed mainly of pressed fibre and concentrated steep liquor was usually found to contain concentrations of all three mycotoxins above those existing in the input maize. A single sample of corn oil recovered during the study also had a high concentration (4.6mg/kg) of ZEN. The analytical clean-up method used converts all trichothecenes present to parent alcohols, therefore results are indicative of total trichothecene content. HPLC analytical conditions suitable for the analysis of NIV and DON in complex process grain products are also described. 3acorn 3amilling 3anivalenol 3adeoxynivalenol 3azearalenone 3acorn gluten 3asolubility 3afeeds 3acorn oil 3afood analysis 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3adietary fiber 3aduration 2aChromatography, High Pressure Liquid 2aFood Handling 2aFusariumxchemistry 2aMycotoxinsxanalysis 2aZea maysxchemistry 0arecovery 0amaize germ 0amaize steep liquor 0adetermination 0alight steep liquor 0aconcentrated steep liquor1 aRingrose, M.A.0 tFood additives & contaminants.g1997 July, v. 14, no. 5 p.435-443x0265-203X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/026520397093745493Available from publisher's Web site  a19980801b19980807c00000000  aINDdHBI  aNon-US 7aarticle02270naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024003500110040001800145100001600163245009300179300001600272520084800288650002101136650001501157650002301172650001801195650004301213650003801256650001501294650002701309650001201336650002601348650004101374650003801415650002001453650002301473650001701496653001301513653001801526700001801544773008701562852000901649856008501658930003301743945001301776946001101789655001201800IND2123608120221121070400.0980624e199707  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND212360812DNAL7 a93285292pmid7 a10.1080/026520397093745512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMarkaki, P.10aOccurrence of aflatoxin M1 in commercial pasteurized milk determined with ELISA and HPLC  ap. 451-456.  aEighty-one samples of commercial pasteurized milk from Athens market were analysed for the presence of aflatoxin M1 (AFM1). A combination of a commercial ELISA kit and a modified HPLC method was applied for the rapid and reliable determination of AFM1. AFM1 concentrations in milk extracts were initially estimated by ELISA. Samples found to contain more than 5 ng/1 were further quantitated by HPLC. Determination was performed after derivatization of AFM1 to its hydroxylated product AFM2a. The recovery of the HPLC method used was found to be close to 100%. Thirty-two samples contained aflatoxin M1 at levels of 2.5-5 ng/l, none contained more than 5 ng/l, while 31 contained only traces of aflatoxin (0.5-1 ng/1). In nine samples no AFM1 was detected. There was no seasonal influence on the aflatoxin content of the milk samples analysed. 3apasteurized milk 3aaflatoxins 3afood contamination 3afood analysis 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3aoccurrence 2aAflatoxin M1xanalysis 2aAnimals 2aCarcinogensxanalysis 2aChromatography, High Pressure Liquid 2aEnzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay 2aMilkxchemistry 2aMutagensxanalysis 2aTime Factors 0arecovery 0adetermination1 aMelissari, E.0 tFood additives & contaminants.g1997 July, v. 14, no. 5 p.451-456x0265-203X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/026520397093745513Available from publisher's Web site  a19980801b19980807c00000000  aINDdHBI  aNon-US 7aarticle02430naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004400092040001800136100001900154245007800173300001300251500001500264520091900279650001501198650001701213650001201230650001101242650001001253650001101263650002301274650002501297650001701322650001901339650001601358650001701374650002301391650000901414650002001423651001201443653001001455653002101465653002001486653001501506653002601521653002501547653002201572653001101594700001701605773009401622852000901716856009401725930003301819945001301852946001101865655001201876IND2046418420221121070459.0950613e199502  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204641842DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-277X.1995.tb00292.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDennison, C.M.10aAdolescent food choice: an application of the theory of Planned Behaviour  ap. 9-23.  a2019-12-04  aThere is consensus among recent studies that adolescents' diets are nutritionally far from ideal. In an effort to increase understanding of the factors affecting food choice decisions in this age group, Ajzen's 'Theory of Planned Behaviour' was employed. Six hundred and seventy-five adolescents, comprising both males and females, from two age groups and two types of school, completed a questionnaire which focused on intentions to eat three common foods at lunchtime. Attitudes and perceptions of control were the components of the model found to account for the most variance in intentions. The addition of a novel measure of friends' behaviour increased the model's explanatory power further. Significant gender and age differences in attitudes, beliefs, levels of dietary restraint and perceived social pressure were present; effects of social background and type of school upon these variables were minimal. 3amotivation 3afood beliefs 3aschools 3asweets 3agirls 3amodels 3agender differences 3asocioeconomic status 3aFrench fries 3ahuman behavior 3aadolescents 3afood choices 3asocial environment 3aboys 3aself-perception 3aEngland 0afruit 0afood restriction 0aage differences 0aintentions 0apercptions of control 0apsychosocial factors 0adietary restraint 0atheory1 aShepherd, R.0 tJournal of human nutrition and dietetics.g1995 Feb., v. 8, no. 1 p.9-23x0952-38717nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-277X.1995.tb00292.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a19950703b19950711c00000000  aINDdHBI  aNon-US 7aarticle01634naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004400092040001800136100001500154245002800169300001600197520060400213650001400817650001700831650000900848650001500857650001800872650001800890650001400908650002300922650002500945653002300970653001000993773009701003852000901100856009401109930003301203945001301236946001101249655001201260IND2055631920221121070445.0970226e199412  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205563192DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-277X.1994.tb00282.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBurr, M.L.10aAntioxidants and cancer  ap. 409-416.  aThis review considers the published evidence concerning the suggestion that the risk of acquiring cancer may be reduced by antioxidants found in fruit and vegetables.

All samples were almost exclusively found to be affected by Fusarium moniliforme, which was isolated from all infected ear sample kernels (100%). In two samples, in addition to F. moniliforme, F. proliferatum was also present but in a reduced percentage of kernels (up to 42%). All samples were found to be contaminated by fumonisin B1 (up to 250 mg/kg). Four samples were also found to be contaminated by beauvericin (up to 10 mg/kg), with higher concentration in samples also infected by F. proliferatum. When cultured on autoclaved maize kernels for 4 weeks at 25 degrees C, all 13 strains of F. moniliforme examined produced fumonisin B1 (up to 3750 mg/kg), whereas only three strains also produced beauvericin, but in very low amounts (5 mg/kg). In the same assay, four isolates of F. proliferatum also produced high amounts of fumonisin B1 (up to 2500 mg/kg) but this was associated with higher concentrations of beauvericin (up to 175 mg/kg). This is the first indication of the production of beauvericin by F. moniliforme, as well as of its co-occurrence with fumonisin B1 in preharvest F. moniliforme maize ear rot. 3aZea mays 3aseeds 3aoccurrence 3astrain differences 3aFusarium fujikuroi 3amycotoxins 3aSardinia 0amolds 0aGibberella fujikuroi1 aLogrieco, A.1 aRitieni, A.1 aMoretti, A.1 aRandazzo, G.1 aCorda, P.0 tFood additives & contaminants.g1995 , v. 12, no. 4 p.599-607x0265-203X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/026520395093743483Available from publisher's Web site  a19960331b19960404c00000000  aINDdHBI  aNon-US 7aarticle01754naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004400092040001800136100001400154245008000168300001400248520046200262650001800724650000900742650000900751650002100760650002100781650001900802650002000821650001600841650001400857650002500871650001400896650001200910650001400922651001900936653001600955653000900971700001500980700001900995700001501014773009501029852000901124856009401133930003301227945001301260946001101273655001201284IND2046426720221121070435.0950614e199502  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204642672DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-277X.1995.tb00297.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee, S.M.10aNutrient content of retail cuts of beef, pork and lamb--preliminary results  ap. 75-80.  aA major programme has been undertaken to analyse the nutrient composition of a wide range of retail cuts of carcass meats, both in the raw and cooked states.

Histologically, the neoplastic cells obliterated the ampulla, with regional spread to the duodenum in all 6 animals and to the pancreas in one animal. Two animals had metastases to the lung, and another two had metastases to the pancreoduodenal lymph nodes and liver. One animal had mesocolonic metastasis.

  1 aCompton, S.R.10aEfficacy of three microbiological monitoring methods in a ventilated cage rack  ap. 382-392.  aThe use of individually ventilated caging (IVC) to house mice presents new challenges for effective microbiological monitoring. Methods that exploit the characteristics of IVC have been developed, but to the authors℗ knowledge, their efficacy has not been systematically investigated. Air exhausted from the IVC rack can be monitored, using sentinels housed in cages that receive rack exhaust air as their supply air, or using filters placed on the exhaust air port. To aid laboratory animal personnel in making informed decisions about effective methods for microbiological monitoring of mice in IVC, the efficacy of air monitoring methods was compared with that of contact and soiled bedding sentinel monitoring. Mice were infected with mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), mouse parvovirus (MPV), murine rotavirus (agent of epizootic diarrhea of mice [EDIM]), Sendai virus (SV), or Helicobacter spp. All agents were detected using contact sentinels. Mouse hepatitis virus was effectively detected in air and soiled bedding sentinels, and SV was detected in air sentinels only. Mouse parvovirus and Helicobacter spp. were transmitted in soiled bedding, but the efficacy of transfer was dependent on the frequency and dilution of soiled bedding transferred. Results were similar when the IVC rack was operated under positive or negative air pressure. Filters were more effective at detecting MHV and SV than they were at detecting MPV. Exposure of sentinels or filters to exhaust air was effective at detecting several infectious agents, and use of these methods could increase the efficacy of microbiological monitoring programs, especially if used with soiled bedding sentinels. In contemporary mouse colonies, a multi-faceted approach to microbiological monitoring is recommended. 3amice 3alaboratory animals 3aventilation systems 3aair pollution 3amicrobial contamination 2aAir Pressure 2aAnimal Husbandry 2aAnimals 2aDisease Transmission, Infectious 2aEnvironment, Controlled 2aEnvironmental Monitoring 2aFemale 2aHousing, Animal 2aMicexmicrobiology 2aSentinel Surveillancexveterinary 2aVentilation 2aVirus Diseasesxbloodxtransmissionxveterinary.1 aHomberger, F.R.1 aPaturzo, F.X.1 aClark, J.

Aluminium (Al) complexed with organic anions (citrate, lactate, malate or tartrate) was added to the diet of four of the groups and aluminium hydroxide to the diet of one group (control 'Al+'). Aluminium concentrations in the diets were 1500-2000 mg/kg. The sixth group (control 'Al-') served as control. Plasma, bone (femur), kidneys, cerebral cortex and cerebellum levels of aluminium were determined at 4 and 8 weeks. All the complexing agents increased tissue accumulations, compared with values in the two control groups, especially citrate in bone and kidneys and lactate in cerebral cortex. There were no significant differences (P < 0.05) in aluminium levels in the tissues considered between the 'Al+' and 'Al-' control groups. Our results show the ability of dietary organic acids to increase aluminium absorption and tissue accumulation and indicate that concurrent intake of aluminium and dietary organic acids is not appropriate. 3arats 3adose response 3atartaric acid 3aexperimental diets 3acerebellum 3ablood plasma 3acerebral cortex 3aintestinal absorption 3aaluminum 3aduration 3amalic acid 3akidneys 3acitric acid 3amineral content 3afemur 3adietary mineral supplements 3alactic acid 2aAbsorptionxdrug effects 2aAluminumxadministration & dosagexpharmacokinetics. 2aAnimals 2aCitratesxadministration & dosagexpharmacology. 2aCitric Acid 2aFemale 2aFood, Formulated 2aLactatesxadministration & dosagexpharmacology. 2aLactic Acid 2aMalatesxadministration & dosagexpharmacology. 2aRats 2aRats, Sprague-Dawley 2aTartratesxadministration & dosagexpharmacology. 2aTissue Distribution 0adiet 0ainteractions 0aretention1 aErba, D.1 aCiappellano, S.1 aBermano, G.0 tFood additives & contaminants.g1996 Jan., v. 13, no. 1 p.21-27x0265-203X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/026520396093743783Available from publisher's Web site  a19970602b19970606c00000000  aINDdHBI  aNon-US 7aarticle04061naa a2200745 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003300111040001800144072001700162072001700179100002200196245019800218300001600416520173800432650002102170650002802191650002802219650001702247650001202264650002902276650001002305650000802315650001102323650002202334650002902356650001002385650002802395650003302423650005002456650002302506650002402529650003402553650002502587650001102612650002202623650001102645650002502656650000902681650003602690650002102726650003502747650003302782650003202815650001702847650001602864650001702880650002802897651001002925700001502935700001902950700001802969700002002987700001703007773009503024852000903119856008303128930003303211945002503244946001103269990002303280655001203303IND4370993020221121050548.0050605e200505  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437099302DNAL7 a157702212pmid7 a10.1038/sj.ejcn.16021302doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Design: Longitudinal, clinical intervention study entailing energy-restricted diet, tailored aerobic-strength exercise, psychological counselling and nutritional education during a 3-week period followed by 49 weeks of indirect supervision at home. Subjects: In all, 45 women and 19 men aged 30.2+/-7.2 y (mean+/-s.d.) with severe obesity (BMI: 41.3+/-4.3 kg/m2), classified as weight losers (final<initial weight) and regainers (final greater than or equal to initial weight). Interventions: Body composition, physical performance and cardiovascular risk factors before and after the BWR program and at follow-up. Results: The large majority of the experimental subjects obtained a clinical success after the 1-y period, and the rate was higher in females (n= 37/45, ie, 82.2%) than in males (n=11/19, ie, 57.9%). At follow-up, weight losers had higher percent fat-free mass, muscle strength, HDL-cholesterol and self-reported physical activity level and lower total cholesterol and glucose levels than weight regainers (P<0.05-0.01). Males displayed significantly larger fat-free mass losses than females at post-BWR and at follow-up. Conclusions: A 3-week hospital-based integrated BWR program resulted in a high rate of clinical success in severely obese individuals at 1-y follow-up (particularly in females), that was associated with increased levels of self-reported physical activity and improved muscle strength and lipid profile. Further research is needed to establish the long-term effects (ie, at 2-5 y) associated to this treatment. 3abody composition 3aweight control programs 3acardiovascular diseases 3arisk factors 3aobesity 3aobesity-related diseases 3awomen 3amen 3aadults 3aphysical activity 3anutritional intervention 2aAdult 2aBlood Glucosexanalysis 2aBody Compositionxphysiology 2aCardiovascular Diseasesxprevention & control 2aCholesterolxblood 2aCounselingxmethods 2aDiet, Fat-Restrictedxmethods 2aExercisexphysiology 2aFemale 2aFollow-Up Studies 2aHumans 2aLongitudinal Studies 2aMale 2aNutritional Sciencesxeducation 2aObesityxtherapy 2aPhysical Endurancexphysiology 2aPhysical Fitnessxphysiology 2aProgram Evaluationxmethods 2aRisk Factors 2aSex Factors 2aTime Factors 2aWeight Lossxphysiology 0aItaly1 aAgosti, F.1 aMarinone, P.G.1 aSilvestri, G.1 aLafortuna, C.L.1 aSartorio, A.0 tEuropean journal of clinical nutrition.g2005 May, v. 59, no. 5 p.685-694x0954-30077nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1038/sj.ejcn.16021303Available from publisher's Web site  a20080321b20080404c00000000  aINDd3CTe2005/11/29  aNon-US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle04022naa a2200805 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003300111040001800144072001700162100001500179245011200194300001600306500001500322520163900337650002801976650001802004650001002022650002002032650001602052650002502068650001702093650001302110650002502123650001202148650001602160650001702176650001602193650000902209650001602218650001502234650006302249650001002312650001602322650000902338650002202347650002502369650004302394650002802437650001002465650005802475650002102533650002802554650003002582650003802612650003302650650001102683650001602694650002202710650002202732651001402754651001402768653001802782653004102800653001602841653001402857700001702871700001802888700001902906773009502925852000903020856008303029930003303112945002503145946001103170990002303181655001203204IND4370992420221121050634.0050605e200505  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437099242DNAL7 a157142182pmid7 a10.1038/sj.ejcn.16020912doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aBell, A.C.10aContribution of 'noncore' foods and beverages to the energy intake and weight status of Australian children  ap. 639-645.  a2019-12-04  aObjectives: The Australian Guide to Healthy Eating is based on five core food groups and water. Foods or beverages that do not fit into these groups are considered extra or 'noncore'. We tested the hypotheses that noncore foods and beverages make a greater proportional contribution to mean daily energy intakes of: (1) children, compared with other age groups; and (2) overweight and obese children, compared with healthy weight children. Design, setting and subjects: We used data from 13 858 participants aged 2 to 80+ y who had 24-h dietary recall data collected in the 1995 cross-sectional Australian National Nutrition Survey. ANOVA was used to compare the percentage of energy provided by noncore foods and beverages by age and weight status. Results: Children (5 to 12 y) and adolescents (13 to 18 y) obtained significantly more (P<0.001) of their daily food energy from noncore foods (41.5 and 43.4%, respectively) than all other age groups. These age groups also obtained significantly more (P<0.001) of their daily beverage energy from noncore beverages (30.7 and 36.9%, respectively). Results were not consistent with weight status, although very young (2-4 y) obese children obtained significantly more energy (P<0.05) from noncore beverages than children in a healthy weight range. Younger children may also have consumed a greater quantity of foods and beverages. Under-reporting may have obscured similar results for older children. Conclusions: By definition, noncore foods and beverages are surplus to the requirements of a healthy diet. We found that Australian children consume these foods and beverages in excess. 3adietary recommendations 3aenergy intake 3agirls 3achild nutrition 3asnack foods 3anutritional adequacy 3arisk factors 3achildren 3aadolescent nutrition 3aobesity 3aadolescents 3afood choices 3asoft drinks 3aboys 3adiet recall 2aAdolescent 2aAdolescent Nutritional Physiological Phenomenaxphysiology 2aAdult 2aAge Factors 2aAged 2aAged, 80 and over 2aAnalysis of Variance 2aBeveragesxstatistics & numerical data 2aBody Weightxphysiology 2aChild 2aChild Nutritional Physiological Phenomenaxphysiology 2aChild, Preschool 2aCross-Sectional Studies 2aEnergy Intakexphysiology 2aFoodxstatistics & numerical data 2aFood Preferencesxphysiology 2aHumans 2aMiddle Aged 2aNutrition Surveys 2aObesityxetiology 3aAustralia 0aAustralia 0aeating habits 0aAustralian National Nutrition Survey 0abody weight 0abeverages1 aKremer, P.J.1 aMagarey, A.M.1 aSwinburn, B.A.0 tEuropean journal of clinical nutrition.g2005 May, v. 59, no. 5 p.639-645x0954-30077nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1038/sj.ejcn.16020913Available from publisher's Web site  a20080321b20080404c00000000  aINDd3CTe2005/11/29  aNon-US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle03538naa a2200685 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003300111040001800144072001700162072001700179100001600196245008300212300001600295500001500311520165500326650002201981650000802003650001902011650002302030650001002053650001702063650002102080650002302101650001202124650001702136650001102153650001502164650001002179650002502189650001202214650003002226650001002256650004602266650001102312650001002323650002202333650003102355650001102386650001102397650001602408650001902424650000902443650002102452650002102473650001702494653001802511700001702529700001502546773009502561852000902656856008302665930003302748945002502781946001102806990002302817655001202840IND4370992520221121050554.0050605e200505  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437099252DNAL7 a157702232pmid7 a10.1038/sj.ejcn.16021152doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aNilsson, M.10aGlucose and insulin responses to porridge and gruel meals intended for infants  ap. 646-650.  a2019-12-04  aObjective: The objective was to determine the glycaemic index (GI) and insulinaemic index (II) of some common products intended for infants; that is, three commercial porridges and one gruel. Also, the influence of added fruit components to porridge on postprandial metabolic responses was studied by comparing corresponding data with a matched model product without fruit. Design: The volunteers were served the test products in random order following an overnight fast. A white bread was included as a reference product. Capillary blood samples were collected before and during 3 h after the meals. Setting: The study was performed at the Department of Applied Nutrition and Food Chemistry, Lund University, Sweden. Subjects: A total of 10 healthy volunteers, six men and four women, aged 24-41 y, with normal body mass indices, were recruited. Results: The GIs (67-75) of the commercial porridges and gruel were significantly lower than for the white bread reference (P<0.05). In contrast, the GI (79) of the model product (porridge without fruit) could not be distinguished from the reference. The IIs (112-149) for the commercial products and model products, respectively, were not significantly different from the reference. Conclusions: The commercial porridges and gruel gave unexpectedly low GIs. In contrast, high IIs were noted. The inconsistency between GI and II could probably be explained by the insulinotrophic effect of the milk component in the products. The fruit and fruit juice added to some of the products had only minor effect on postprandial glycaemia.

  1 aBielefeldt-Ohmann, H.10aSubacute necrotizing encephalopathy in a pig-tailed macaque (Macaca nemestrina) that resembles mitochondrial encephalopathy in humans  ap. 422-433.  aA male pig-tailed macaque (Macaca nemestrina), approximately 5 years old, was found to be vision-impaired and to have profound behavioral abnormalities, including hyperactivity and self-injurious behavior that was not amenable to amelioration by environmental enrichment. Facial and skeletal dysmorphisms also were noted. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and positron emission tomography (PET) scanning revealed areas of possible infarction in the occipital lobes and megaventriculosis. At necropsy, following euthanasia for humane reasons, severe polio- and leukoencephalomalacia accompanied by megaventriculosis were seen in both occipital lobes and in several sulci of the parietal and frontal lobes. Light microscopic findings included loss of neocortical structure, with necrosis, neuronal loss, astrogliosis, vascular proliferation, mild spongiosis, and demyelination. The extent and severity of lesions were most pronounced in the occipital lobes and were greater in the left than in the right hemisphere. Other lesions included mild bilateral atrophy of the optic nerves, thymic involution, necrotizing dermatitis due to trauma, and a spectrum of spermatozoal abnormalities. The imaging and gross and light microscopic changes found in this animal resemble the mitochondrial encephalopathies of humans; this was corroborated by results of immunohistochemical analysis demonstrating decreased expression of enzymes of the mitochondrial oxidative complex ([OC]-I, -III, and -IV) in brain and muscle, and detection of fibrinogen immunoreactivity in neurons and glial cells. The spermatozoal defects may represent yet another aspect of a mitochondrial defect. 3alaboratory animals 3acase studies 3amitochondria 3ahistopathology 3aanimal pathology 2aAnimals 2aAnimals, Laboratory 2aBehavior, Animalxphysiology 2aBrainxpathologyxphysiopathology. 2aHumans 2aLeigh Diseasexpathologyxphysiopathologyxveterinary. 2aMacaca nemestrina 2aMale 2aMitochondriaxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aMitochondrial Encephalomyopathiesxpathologyxphysiopathologyxveterinary. 2aMonkey Diseasesxpathologyxphysiopathology. 2aSpermatozoaxabnormalitiesxmetabolism.1 aBellanca, R.U.1 aCrockett, C.M.1 aCurnow, E.1 aEiffert, K.1 aGillen, M.1 aGlanister, D.1 aHayes, E.1 aKelley, S.1 aMinoshima, S.0 tComparative medicine.g2004 Aug., v. 54, no. 4 p.422-433x1532-08207nnas  aDNAL  a20050302b20050401c00000000  aINDdJITe2005/03/02  aOther US 7aarticle03557naa a2200817 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003300111040001800144072001700162072001700179100001700196245026000213300001800473500001500491520111700506650003701623650002301660650002001683650001201703650000801715650001001723650002001733650002001753650002501773650002301798650002301821650002401844650002001868650001801888650001001906650000901916650002501925650001901950650002801969650002301997650001102020650001902031650001102050650000902061650001602070650001602086650001202102650001802114650002402132650001702156650003702173650001702210650002702227651001202254651001202266653000902278653005102287653001902338700001602357700001402373700001402387700001202401700001602413700001502429773009902444852000902543856008302552930003302635945002502668946001102693990002302704655001202727IND4365444020221121015231.0041108e200410  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436544402DNAL7 a150544192pmid7 a10.1038/sj.ejcn.16019792doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Design: Cross-sectional population based study. Setting and participants: 20 292 men and women aged 39-79 y who participated in the EPIC-Norfolk study. Results: Individuals in manual social classes, who had no educational qualifications or those who lived in the most deprived areas had significantly lower levels of plasma ascorbic acid compared to those in nonmanual social classes, with at least O-level qualifications or who lived in less deprived areas. The magnitude of effect for each measure of socioeconomic status was greater in current smokers compared to current nonsmokers. Conclusion: Education and social class were stronger predictors of differences in ascorbic acid levels, an indicator of dietary health behaviour, than a deprivation index based on the Townsend score. This suggests that education could be particularly important in influencing large socioeconomic differentials in health related behaviours and potentially, health outcomes in the UK. 3asociodemographic characteristics 3anutritional status 3ablood chemistry 3apoverty 3amen 3awomen 3ahuman nutrition 3asmoking (habit) 3asocioeconomic status 3aeducational status 3asocial environment 3adietary supplements 3adietary surveys 3aascorbic acid 2aAdult 2aAged 2aAscorbic Acidxblood 2aCohort Studies 2aCross-Sectional Studies 2aEducational Status 2aFemale 2aHealth Surveys 2aHumans 2aMale 2aMiddle Aged 2aOccupations 2aPoverty 2aPoverty Areas 2aProspective Studies 2aRisk Factors 2aSmokingxadverse effectsxblood. 2aSocial Class 2aSocioeconomic Factors. 3aEngland 0aEngland 0adiet 0aEuropean Prospective Investigation into Cancer 0aTownsend score1 aBingham, S.1 aWelch, A.1 aLuben, R.1 aDay, N.1 aWareham, N.1 aKhaw, K.T.0 tEuropean journal of clinical nutrition.g2004 Oct., v. 58, no. 10 p.1432-1435x0954-30077nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1038/sj.ejcn.16019793Available from publisher's Web site  a20050723b20050802c00000000  aINDd3CTe2004/12/02  aNon-US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle02351naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002600110245012900136300001600265520105400281650004801335650001001383650001501393650001701408650001301425650000901438650002401447650001101471650001901482650000901501650001101510650002401521650001501545650001101560650000901571650002001580700002101600700002601621700002201647773007601669852000901745856010501754939003301859946001301892655001201905IND4478504820221120232111.0140317e200204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447850482DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDoncheva, Nadezhda Iv10aExperimental and clinical study on the hypolipidemic and antisclerotic effect of Lactobacillus Bulgaricus strain GB N 1 (48)  ap. 393-403.  aThe study aims to perform experimental and clinical testing of the effect of the milk product "Bulgaricum" containing Lactobacillus Bulgaricus (LB) strain GB N 1 (48) on the progress and severity of experimental model of hyperlipidemia and sclerotic processes serum lipids and blood flow in aa. carotides in persons with dyslipoproteinemia (DLP).

In the first year of the study, three applications of 7.4 X 10(11) AcMNPV polyhedra containing 48% genetically altered and 52% wild-type virus particles (co-occluded) were made on a 0.1-ha circular plot of cabbage plants. The application area was surrounded by a 0.7-ha circular buffer zone. Before each application, the plants in the application area were infested with 4,500 third-instar Trichoplusia ni (Hubner) larvae. After each application, 100% of the T. ni test larvae sampled 5 d after infection were infected with AcMNPV and produced progeny polyhedra containing an average of 42 +/- 17.6% genetically altered virus particles. At the end of the 1st yr, the progeny polyhedra population in the application area was estimated at 1.6 X 10(13) polyhedra. In the 2nd yr, the application and buffer sites were replanted with cabbage plants. At four times during the growing season, the plants were seeded with T. ni larvae or eggs. Less than 2% of the test larvae became infected with AcMNPV. Polyhedra were extracted from soil samples collected in the application and buffer areas. Using neonate larval bioassays with the soil extracts, it was estimated that the soil in the application and buffer areas contained an average of 1,652 +/- 3,370 and 832 +/- 2,539 biologically active polyhedra per gram dry weight, respectively. Seventy-five larvae infected with polyhedra extracted from application area soil samples produced progeny polyhedra containing a mean of 9 +/- 19% genetically altered virus particles. In the 3rd yr, the application area soil samples contained an average of 1,671 +/- 3,274 biologically active polyhedra per gram dry weight, Eighty-four progeny polyhedral samples contained a mean of 6 +/- 14% genetically altered virus particles. The co-occlusion strategy did not alter the environmental persistence of the polyhedra containing both wild-type and polyhedrin-minus virus particles. However, the data show a decline in the percent of polyhedrin-minus particles in the polyhedra and demonstrate that the persistence of a polyhedrin-minus virus in a cycling virus population is limited by the co-occlusion process. The environmentally desirable attributes of using the co-occlusion process for genetically enhanced baculovirus pesticides and possible problems are discussed. 3asampling 3aTrichoplusia ni 3aBrassica 3aBaculoviridae 3asoil 3aAutographa californica 3agenetic engineering 3ainsect control 3aadverse effects 3aNew York 0aNucleopolyhedrovirus 0anontarget effects1 aHughes, P.R.1 aShelton, A.0 tEnvironmental entomology.g1994 Apr., v. 23, no. 2 p.211-219x0046-225X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ee/23.2.2113Available from publisher's Web site  a19940802b19940811c00000000  aINDdTLX  aOther US 7aarticle02943naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003000092040001800122100001600140245016300156300001800319520182400337650001702161650002402178650002402202650002502226650001602251650000802267650001602275650003002291651001202321700001602333773008402349852000902433856008002442930003302522945001302555946001302568655001202581IND2039123820221120211937.0940428e199312  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203912382DNAL7 a10.1093/ee/22.6.13752doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSmith, S.M.10aOviposition by the forest tent caterpillar (Lepidoptera: Lasiocampidae) and acceptability of its eggs to Trichogramma minutum (Hymenoptera: Trichogrammatidae)  ap. 1375-1382.  aStudies were conducted to assess the availability and acceptability of eggs of forest tent caterpillar, Malacosoma disstria Hubner, to Trichogramma minutum Riley for use in inundative releases. Oviposition by the forest tent caterpillar occurred 4-19 July and lasted 7-10 d in southern Ontario. At least 50% of the egg-laying activity occurred during the first 3-4 d. Oviposition was initiated on the same day as female moth emergence, 2 d after male moth emergence. Pheromone traps baited with two-component lures predicted oviposition within 2 d. No Trichogramma emerged successfully from 0- to 7-d-old host eggs, although the survival of tent caterpillar embryos exposed at this age to the parasitoids was reduced significantly (from 97.5 to 42.3%). The greatest number of Trichogramma emerging from caterpillar egg masses (72.7%) was observed in those eggs exposed to parasitoids 21 d after oviposition, with 43.5 and 12.5% emergence from egg masses exposed at 14 and 28 d after oviposition, respectively. A tent caterpillar egg mass contained 109.8 +/- 14.8 (mean +/- SE) eggs; parasitoids emerged from 14.4 +/- 3.5 of these eggs (13.1% egg parasitism). The number of parasitoids emerging from each parasitized egg ranged from 5.0 to 11.0; 69.5% were female and development at 20 degrees C took 14.2 +/- 0.2 d. Removal of the spumaline layer from the egg masses increased emergence of parasitoids very slightly. No Trichogramma successfully overwintered in forest tent caterpillar eggs, although a single dead parasitoid (0.2%) was observed infrequently in eggs simultaneously with a dead pharate larva. Trichogramma possibly can be used in inundative releases against M. disstria; however, further studies are needed to determine why the parasitoid kills but does not emerge from tent caterpillar eggs < 14 d old. 3aQuercus alba 3aPopulus tremuloides 3aMalacosoma disstria 3aTrichogramma minutum 3aoviposition 3aova 3aparasitoids 3abiological control agents 3aOntario1 aStrom, K.B.0 tEnvironmental entomology.g1993 Dec., v. 22, no. 6 p.1375-1382x0046-225X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ee/22.6.13753Available from publisher's Web site  a19940603b19940609c00000000  aINDdTLX  aOther US 7aarticle01650naa a2200277 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003000092040001800122100001700140245012600157300001800283520074500301650002701046650001401073653001601087653002501103773008401128852000901212856008001221930003301301945001301334946001301347655001201360IND2039123520221120211853.0940428e199312  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203912352DNAL7 a10.1093/ee/22.6.13622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aClarke, G.M.10aPatterns of developmental stability of Chrysopa perla L.

Results are discussed with reference to the relationship between asymmetry and phenodeviants as indicators of stability and the use of developmental stability as a means of assessing environmental quality. 3abiological development 3apollution 0adeformities 0achrysoperla harrisii0 tEnvironmental entomology.g1993 Dec., v. 22, no. 6 p.1362-1366x0046-225X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ee/22.6.13623Available from publisher's Web site  a19940603b19940609c00000000  aINDdTLX  aOther US 7aarticle03111naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002100152245008000173300001600253500002400269500001500293520199500308650001402303650001602317650001102333650001802344650001602362650002602378650001502404650000902419650002402428650001302452650001202465650001502477651001402492653001502506700002302521773009302544852000902637856005502646655001202701IND4444421920221120145117.0101029e201010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444442192DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1600-0587.2010.06127.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHolland, Greg J.10aHabitat fragmentation disrupts the demography of a widespread native mammal  ap. 841-853.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-05  aFragmentation theory predicts that population persistence should be positively correlated with the size of habitat fragments. The patterns of occurrence of many species are consistent with this prediction, but the demographic processes that determine how species respond to fragmentation are poorly understood. In addition, habitat quality may interact with fragment size as an influence on demographic performance. We investigated these predictions for the native bush rat Rattus fuscipes by testing the following hypotheses: 1) population performance (i.e. viability as determined by various demographic parameters) is positively correlated with fragment size; and 2) population performance is positively correlated with habitat quality. Populations of R. fuscipes were censused in two large (>49 ha) and eight small (<2.5 ha) forest fragments in an agricultural region of southeastern Australia. Fragments with high and low quality habitat were included in each size category. Fragment size influenced multiple aspects of population demography; populations in large fragments had higher densities, older age structures, received more potential immigrants, and were more likely to recruit adults than those in small fragments. Reproductive patterns were more predictable in large fragments. Habitat quality per se had less marked effects; adult females were heavier and subadults more prevalent in fragments with high quality habitat. However, high quality habitat enhanced population performance in small fragments more so than in large ones. Despite being widespread in the study area, R. fuscipes populations are profoundly impacted by habitat fragmentation, with population performance declining with fragment size. Studies based on patterns of species occurrence should be interpreted with caution as they may mask critical processes occurring at the population level. For a thorough understanding of the effects of habitat fragmentation, population‐level studies are required. 3aviability 3acorrelation 3aRattus 3aage structure 3aimmigration 3ahabitat fragmentation 3ademography 3arats 3apopulation dynamics 3ahabitats 3afemales 3aprediction 3aAustralia 0aimmigrants1 aBennett, Andrew F.0 tEcography.g2010 Oct., v. 33, no. 5 p.841-853dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0906-75907nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1600-0587.2010.06127.x 7aarticle02578naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024003500110040001800145100001500163245012000178300001600298520103500314650003401349650001901383650001901402650001401421650001801435650000701453650001101460650001901471650001501490650001201505650001901517650002501536650002201561650001901583650005901602650003101661650002901692650001301721650002401734653001501758653001101773653001301784700001701797773008301814852000901897856008501906930003301991945001302024946001102037655001202048IND2180358820221120141226.0981008e199802  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND218035882DNAL7 a96029302pmid7 a10.1080/026520398093746342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBoskou, G.10aIn vitro study of TMAO reduction by Shewanella putrefaciens isolated from cod fillets packed in modified atmosphere  ap. 229-236.  aA strain of Shewanella putrefaciens was isolated from cod fillets in a modified atmosphere (60% CO2, 30% O2, 10% N2). The effect of pH on the growth of Shewanella putrefaciens and TMAO reduction was studied in fish extract with citrate buffer systems at pH values from 5.8 to 6.8. The effect of the modified atmosphere (CO2, O2) on the growth of S. putrefaciens and on the reduction of TMAO to TMA was studied using solid media from fish extract packed under variable mixtures of CO2, O2 and N2. All the samples were incubated at 7 degrees C for 7 days. Slow development of S. putrefaciens and no production of TMA was observed in fish extract buffered at pH 5.8. Inclusion of O2 in the packaging atmosphere of solid fish extract, even at small proportions (10%), was inhibitory for the reduction of TMAO, while there was no effect of O2 on the growth of S. putrefaciens. Increased levels of CO2 (greater than or equal to 50%) in the atmosphere were inhibiting the growth of S. putrefaciens and consequently the production of TMA. 3acontrolled atmosphere storage 3afood packaging 3atrimethylamine 3aanaerobes 3afood spoilage 3apH 3aoxygen 3acarbon dioxide 3acod (fish) 2aAnimals 2aCarbon Dioxide 2aFishesxmicrobiology 2aFood Microbiology 2aFood Packaging 2aGram-Negative Facultatively Anaerobic Rodsxmetabolism 2aHydrogen-Ion Concentration 2aMethylaminesxmetabolism 2aOxidants 2aOxidation-Reduction 0ainhibition 0agrowth 0ain vitro1 aDebevere, J.0 tFood additives & contaminants.g1998 , v. 15, no. 2 p.229-236x0265-203X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/026520398093746343Available from publisher's Web site  a19981201b19981208c00000000  aINDdHBI  aNon-US 7aarticle02427naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024003500110040001800145100001500163245011800178300001400296520083100310650000901141650000901150650001001159650001101169650002601180650002401206650002301230650001301253650005401266650004201320650002301362650002501385650002901410650002501439650002701464651001401491653001801505653002501523653001301548653001601561700002101577700001901598700001701617700001501634773008501649852000901734856008501743930003301828945001301861946001101874655001201885IND2180478620221120141214.0981014e199801  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND218047862DNAL7 a95348712pmid7 a10.1080/026520398093745982doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTorres, A.10aProduction of alternariol and alternariol mono-methyl ether by isolates of Alternaria spp. from Argentinian maize  ap. 56-60.  aAlternaria cultures (87 isolates of Alternaria alternata, four of A. tenuissima, two of A. radicina, and three of Alternaria state of Pleospora infectoria respectively, from maize) were screened to determine their ability to produce alternariol (AOH) and alternariol monomethyl ether (AME) on maize and rice.

The level of AOH produced by the isolates ranged from 0.3 to 2.1 mg/kg on maize and from 0.4 to 9.9 mg/kg on rice. The AME production by the stains ranged between 0.3 and 3.3 mg/kg both on maize and on rice.

The scope of spectroscopic methods for alternative and migration tests is presented. 1H-NMR can be used in several ways, from a simple fingerprint of the potential migrants to an identification procedure. Extraction is optimized using UV spectrophotometry. Optimization relies on extraction kinetics, which include the demonstration that extraction is more severe than migration. Only a few hours are required to conclude whether a material complies with the regulation. The specific migration limits are expressed as specific absorbance limit values, alpha. These data can be annexed by food industries to specifications of a plastic packaging material. 3apackaging materials 3aultraviolet radiation 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aaromatic compounds 3aolefin 3aextraction 3afood packaging 3aethanolamine 3atesting 3aEuropean Union 3aantioxidants 3apolymers 3adetection 3aadditives 2aAntioxidantsxanalysisxchemistry. 2aEthanolaminesxchemistry 2aEuropean Union 2aFood Contamination 2aFood Packagingxlegislation & jurisprudence 2aHumans 2aMagnetic Resonance Spectroscopy 2aPlasticsxchemistry 2aPolyenesxchemistry 2aSpectrophotometry, Ultraviolet 0aoptimization 0aregulation 0aspectroscopy1 aScholler, D.1 aBouquant, J.1 aFeigenbaum, A.0 tFood additives & contaminants.g1998 Jan., v. 15, no. 1 p.100-111x0265-203X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/026520398093746043Available from publisher's Web site  a19981201b19981208c00000000  aINDdHBI  aNon-US 7aarticle03010naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024003500110040001800145100001500163245006900178300001400247520136200261650002201623650001101645650001201656650002301668650001201691650001801703650001401721650001401735650001301749650002401762650002801786650006401814650002401878650004101902650001201943650003001955650001901985650001202004650002602016650002802042650002402070650002802094653001602122653001702138653000902155700001602164700001602180773008502196852000902281856008502290930003302375945001302408946001102421655001202432IND2180478820221120130937.0981014e199801  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND218047882DNAL7 a95348732pmid7 a10.1080/026520398093746002doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCooper, I.10aSpecific migration testing with alternative fatty food simulants  ap. 72-78.  aMany additives used in plastics materials and articles intended for food contact are expected to be assigned specific migration limits (SMLs) in a future amendment to EC Directive 90/128/EEC. In order to demonstrate compliance with these restrictions, specific migration tests will need to be performed on the finished plastics packaging using foods or the appropriate EC food simulants. Owing to the involatile and lipophilic nature of many of these additives, their analysis in the conventional fatty food simulant, olive oil, presents technical difficulties. One way of overcoming these difficulties would be to use a simple solvent alternative to olive oil as has been proposed for overall migration testing. The objective of this work is to compare specific migration data obtained using olive oil with alternative fat simulants iso-octane and 95% ethanol, to find out if similar results are obtained and identify the most appropriate alternative simulant to use for future testing. Good agreement with the olive oil migration data was obtained using 95% ethanol (equivalent exposure conditions) for both of the additives studied in polyolefins. For the polystyrene materials studied it is unlikely that the SMLs for the two additives would be exceeded, and in these cases iso-octane (1.5 h at 60 degrees C) could be used as a rapid 'alternative test'. 3asimulation models 3aoctane 3aethanol 3afood contamination 3atesting 3afood analysis 3aolive oil 3aadditives 3apolymers 2aAdipatesxchemistry 2aAntioxidantsxchemistry 2aButylated Hydroxytoluenexanalogs & derivativesxchemistry. 2aChromatography, Gas 2aChromatography, High Pressure Liquid 2aEthanol 2aFood Additivesxchemistry 2aFood Packaging 2aOctanes 2aPlant Oilsxchemistry 2aPlasticizersxchemistry 2aPolyenesxchemistry 2aPolystyrenesxchemistry 0acomparisons 0airganox 1076 0adeha1 aGoodson, A.1 aO'Brien, A.0 tFood additives & contaminants.g1998 Jan., v. 15, no. 1 p.72-78x0265-203X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/026520398093746003Available from publisher's Web site  a19981201b19981208c00000000  aINDdHBI  aNon-US 7aarticle02454naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004400092040001800136100001700154245008900171300001600260520097700276650002001253650001701273650001101290650001601301650001601317650001301333650001301346650000901359650000801368650001301376650002401389650002501413650002701438650002501465650002301490651001901513653001301532653001701545653001601562653001601578700001701594700002001611700001801631700001801649773009701667852000901764856009401773930003301867945001301900946001101913655001201924IND2059927420221120131025.0970926e199506  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205992742DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-277X.1995.tb00311.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSackey, A.H.10aGrowth hormone as a nutritional adjunct in cystic fibrosis: results of a pilot study  ap. 185-189.  aGrowth hormone (GH) stimulates linear growth and improves nitrogen balance in many catabolic states, including sepsis, and in malnutrition associated with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. In children with cystic fibrosis (CF), these anabolic effects could aid survival and enhance suitability for transplantation. We assessed response to 0.49 IU/kg/week of recombinant human growth hormone (hGH) for 6-12 months in seven children with cystic fibrosis. All showed an initial increase in height velocity (0.33-4.14 cm/year) and height standard deviation score (P< 0.01). Knemometry also demonstrated a significant improvement in lower leg growth (P <0.05). Weight velocity increased in live patients but there was no change in body mass index or skinfold thickness. The number of respiratory exacerbations decreased during therapy, although there was no measurable improvement in respiratory function.

A similar amount of energy was added to the food of four subjects. Normal food and drink was available ad libitum, and adjustments in food energy were made by the interchange of sugar and artificial sweeteners. Compensation for the theoretical energy deficit or surplus was incomplete, averaging around 50%. This, however, was very variable, some subjects achieving more than 90% recovery, whereas others failed completely to adjust energy intake within this timespan. It is concluded that the regulation of energy balance in the lean is a long-term phenomenon, conditioned by large day-to-day fluctuations in energy intake. The removal of sugar from the food raised the energy density of the diet. The substitution of artificial sweeteners for sugar caused an increase of 11% in total fat intake. The restoration of sugar had an opposite effect. This inverse relationship between dietary sugar and fat poses problems for those seeking to lose weight, and for the lean attempting to follow current guidelines for a 'healthier' diet without incurring weight loss. 3anutrient content 3aenergy intake 3adietary fat 3adietary protein 3amen 3abody weight 3aexperimental diets 3aaspartame 3aenergy density 3asugars 3aalcoholic beverages 3adietary carbohydrate 0aenergy content 0adiet 0aadaptation 0aregulation 0aenergy balance1 aRhodes, C.0 tJournal of human nutrition and dietetics.g1995 June, v. 8, no. 3 p.167-175x0952-38717nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-277X.1995.tb00309.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a19971102b19971106c00000000  aINDdHBI  aNon-US 7aarticle02399naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002900092040001800121100001500139245013900154300001600293520128100309650003001590650002101620650001901641650002601660650002301686650001601709650003001725650002301755651001401778700001601792773008201808852000901890856007901899930003301978945001302011946001302024655001202037IND2040988520221120131137.0940722e199404  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204098852DNAL7 a10.1093/ee/23.2.3492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBoyd, M.L.10aSeasonal incidence of aphids and the aphid parasitoid Diaeretiella rapae (M'Intosh) (Hymenoptera: Aphidiidae) on rapeseed in Tennessee  ap. 349-353.  aAphids and their parasitoids were sampled in seven and eight commercial rapeseed fields in 1990 and 1991, respectively. Whole-plant sampling was used for aphids during the budding plant stage. Sweep-net sampling was used for aphids and their parasitoids during the flowering and ripening plant stages. Three species of aphids, turnip aphid, Lipaphis erysimi (Kaltenbach); green peach aphid, Myzus persicae (Sulzer); and cabbage aphid, Brevicoryne brassicae (L.), were collected. The turnip aphid was the most abundant species collected in 1990 and 1991, 99.9 and 86.8%, respectively. Turnip aphid populations peaked (80%) most frequently during the flowering stage, and visual observations taken of feeding damage noted stunted growth, reduced pod formation, and uneven stand maturity. Turnip aphids were parasitized by the wasp parasitoid, Diaeretiella rapae (M'Intosh) (Hymenoptera: Aphidiidae). In 1990, the total D. rapae density was 883 wasps per 50 sweeps and this was 24 times higher than the total 1991 density of 37 wasps per 50 sweeps. Aphid infestations were observed to cause substantial damage to rapeseed stands in 1990. However, the lack of quantitative yield-loss data precludes the effective integration of natural and chemical control strategies on rapeseed. 3aBrassica napus var. napus 3aLipaphis erysimi 3aMyzus persicae 3aBrevicoryne brassicae 3aDiaeretiella rapae 3aparasitoids 3abiological control agents 3aseasonal variation 3aTennessee1 aLentz, G.L.0 tEnvironmental entomology.g1994 Apr., v. 23, no. 2 p.349-353x0046-225X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ee/23.2.3493Available from publisher's Web site  a19940802b19940811c00000000  aINDdTLX  aOther US 7aarticle01692naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100003300110245009500143300001600238520069500254650002500949650001700974650001100991650002801002650001401030650001201044650001601056700002901072700002901101773007601130852000901206856010501215939003301320946001301353655001201366IND4478505920221120115026.0140317e200204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447850592DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSánchez-Moreno, Concepción10aLDL oxidizability indexes in measurement of antioxidant activity in selected Spanish wines  ap. 507-517.  aSpanish red, rosé and white wines were studied for antioxidant activity inhibiting the copper-catalyzed oxidation of human LDL in vitro.

Moths were also sampled in the southern United States at several locations suspected or known to be sources of migrant black cutworms. Forewing length, forewing width, prothoracic width, and body length were measured; and relative darkness of thoracic pubescence was scored for each moth. By comparing the morphology of northern moths (migrants, by definition) with that of southern moths (presumably containing mixtures of migrants and nonmigrants), we hoped to determine whether migrant A. ipsilon could be distinguished morphologically from nonmigrants. Principal component analyses extracted two important axes from the raw data. The first was a general-size axis, and the second was primarily a relative-darkness, or color, axis. All analyses were performed on the factor scores along these axes. There was no difference in mean size of northern and southern moths, nor was there a consistent latitudinal gradient in size between northern locations. There was, however, reduced variation in the migrant populations; i.e., very small and very large moths were underrepresented in the northern compared with the southern populations. Comparisons between northern moths thought to have originated in the Brownsville, Texas, region suggested that migrants tended to have lighter coloration than those in the source population. But light coloration by itself cannot indicate migrant individuals because, in one instance (Columbia, MO 1985), a migrant population was darker than populations from all other locations sampled that year. The data indicate that, at least in the case of males, migrants cannot be distinguished morphologically from nonmigrants. The results are consistent with the hypothesis that A. ipsilon is an obligate migrant and that there is no distinctive migratory phase induced by environmental cues or conditions. 3ainsect pests 3amigratory behavior 3amales 3acolor 3aAgrotis ipsilon 3aanatomy and morphology 3aIowa 3aIllinois 3aTexas 3aArkansas 3aNebraska 3aLouisiana 3aOntario 3aMissouri 0asize 0aseasonal migration1 aShowers, W.B.1 aNcNutt, J.J.1 aBernhardt, J.L.1 aGoodenough, J.L.1 aKeaster, A.J.1 aLevine, E.1 aMcLeod, D.G.R.1 aRobinson, J.F.1 aWay, O.0 tEnvironmental entomology.g1994 Feb., v. 23, no. 1 p.58-67x0046-225X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ee/23.1.583Available from publisher's Web site  a19940907b19940913c00000000  aINDdTLX  aOther US 7aarticle02771naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002800092040001800120100001600138245012000154300001400274500001500288520153300303650001701836650002601853650001801879650001201897650001501909650002301924650002301947650002401970650002201994650001002016650001902026651001802045653001302063653001802076700001702094773008002111852000902191856007802200930003302278945001302311946001302324655001202337IND2041102620221120115010.0940727e199402  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204110262DNAL7 a10.1093/ee/23.1.682doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCulik, M.P.10aSeasonal crawling activity of adult root-feeding insect pests (Coleoptera: Curculionidae; Scolytidae) of red clover  ap. 68-75.  a2019-12-04  aPitfall traps located between red clover, Trifolium pratense L., stands and adjacent pasture and woods were used to monitor seasonal and directional crawling activity by adults of four species of root-feeding insect pests of red clover: Hylastinus obscurus (Marsham), Calomycterus setarius Roelofs, Sitona flavescens Marsham, and Sitona hispidulus (F.). Trapping was conducted at a site in Monongalia County, West Virginia, from May to November 1990, March to December 1991, and April to June 1992. Peak crawling activity by H. obscurus occurred in June. Peak C. setarius activity was from June to September. Peak S. flavescens activity occurred from April to May and from September to November. S. hispidulus had three periods of peak activity: in the spring (April-May), summer (mid-June-mid-July), and fall (September-mid-November). Few directional trends in movement were apparent for H. obscurus and S. flavescens, indicating that their movement by crawling is limited to short distances within or between red clover stands. Most C. setarius were caught in traps located between the red clover and adjacent woods. Movement into the red clover was primarily from the direction of the woods. During its period of summer activity, S. hispidulus movement from the red clover was directed toward adjacent woods. During spring and fall, greater numbers of S. hispidulus adults moved toward the red clover from adjacent woods than from the red clover toward the woods, and movement from the red clover was toward adjacent pasture. 3ainsect pests 3aCalomycterus setarius 3apitfall traps 3asurveys 3aScolytidae 3aTrifolium pratense 3aseasonal variation 3aHylastinus obscurus 3aSitona hispidulus 3aroots 3aSitona lepidus 3aWest Virginia 0amovement 0aCurculionidae1 aWeaver, J.E.0 tEnvironmental entomology.g1994 Feb., v. 23, no. 1 p.68-75x0046-225X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ee/23.1.683Available from publisher's Web site  a19940907b19940913c00000000  aINDdTLX  aOther US 7aarticle02548naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024004200133040001800175100001500193245008500208300001600293506007600309520092600385506003701311650002201348650003701370650001101407650002201418650001001440650002001450650001901470650001201489650002501501650001201526650002501538650002501563650002301588650001101611650001901622650004001641650002501681653001701706700002101723700002001744773012101764852000901885856009201894930003301986946001102019655001202030IND4442486520221207123416.0100917e201010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444248652DNAL7 a206090212pmid7 aPMC29706502pmcid7 a10.1111/j.1365-2583.2010.01025.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGeorge, P.10aHigh-resolution cytogenetic map for the African malaria vector Anopheles gambiae  ap. 675-682.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCytogenetic and physical maps are indispensible for precise assembly of genome sequences, functional characterization of chromosomal regions, and population genetic and taxonomic studies. We have created a new cytogenetic map for Anopheles gambiae by using a high-pressure squash technique that increases overall band clarity. To link chromosomal regions to the genome sequence, we attached genome coordinates, based on 302 markers of bacterial artificial chromosome, cDNA clones, and PCR-amplified gene fragments, to the chromosomal bands and interbands at approximately a 0.5-1 Mb interval. In addition, we placed the breakpoints of seven common polymorphic inversions on the map and described the chromosomal landmarks for the arm and inversion identification. The map's increased resolution can be used to further enhance physical mapping, improve genome assembly, and stimulate epigenomic studies of malaria vectors.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAnopheles gambiae 3abacterial artificial chromosomes 3aclones 3acomplementary DNA 3agenes 3agenome assembly 3ainsect vectors 3amalaria 3anucleotide sequences 2aAnimals 2aAnophelesxgenetics. 2aChromosome Inversion 2aChromosome Mapping 2aFemale 2aGenome, Insect 2aIn Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence 2aPolytene Chromosomes 0aphysical map1 aSharakhova, M.V.1 aSharakhov, I.V.0 tInsect molecular biology.g2010 Oct., v. 19, no. 5 p.675-682dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0962-10757nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2583.2010.01025.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20100917b20101001c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02493naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024003500133040001800168100001900186245012500205300001600330520101000346650002201356650001601378650001401394650002101408650001001429650002701439650003701466650002801503650001101531650002301542650001601565650001701581650003001598653001101628653002301639700003001662700002501692700002801717773014001745852000901885856008501894930003301979946001102012655001202023IND4441852120221120105409.0100827e201009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444185212DNAL7 a205566612pmid7 aPMC29264742pmcid7 a10.1007/s11517-010-0647-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStam, Barbara 10a3D finite compartment modeling of formation and healing of bruises may identify methods for age determination of bruises  ap. 911-921.  aSimulating the spatial and temporal behavior of bruises may identify methods that allow accurate age determination of bruises to assess child abuse. We developed a numerical 3D model to simulate the spatial kinetics of hemoglobin and bilirubin during the formation and healing of bruises. Using this model, we studied how skin thickness, bruise diameter and diffusivities affect the formation and healing of circular symmetric bruises and compared a simulated bruise with a natural inhomogeneous bruise. Healing is faster for smaller bruises in thinner and less dense skin. The simulated and natural bruises showed similar spatial and temporal dynamics. The different spatio-temporal dynamics of hemoglobin and bilirubin allows age determination of model bruises. Combining our model predictions with individual natural bruises may allow optimizing our model parameters. It may particularly identify methods for more accurate age determination than currently possible to aid the assessment of child abuse. 3aage determination 3achild abuse 3adiffusion 2aBilirubinxblood 2aChild 2aChild Abusexdiagnosis 2aContusionsxdiagnosisxetiology. 2aHemoglobinsxmetabolism 2aHumans 2aModels, Biological 2aPhotography 2aTime Factors 2aWound Healingxphysiology 0aBruise 0aNumerical modeling1 aGemert, Martin J.

Carr., and white spruce, P. glauca (Moench) Voss, in south-central Alaska. The effects of tree species on lesion length were nonsignificant; however, die effects of wounding versus wounding plus blue-stain inoculate were highly significant. Lesion length was significantly longer in high-flow Lutz spruce compared with low-flow trees that were wounded. There was a significant change in monoterpene composition in the induced reaction zones of wounded phloem compared with unwounded phloem. The total percentage of potential toxic monoterpenes such as limonene, myrcene, 3-carene, and beta phellandrene increased in all three host species. Egg gallery length and the area of phloem consumed by larvae outside of lesions was significantly less for trees with wounds caused by fungal inoculation compared with mechanical wounds only. Trees with fungal inoculations appeared to deter larval feeding. Hydroxystilbenes were not found in the three species of spruce; however, differences were found in the chemical content of the reaction and the nonreaction zones. Two unknown chemicals present in nonreaction zones were not found in the induced reaction zone. One chemical appears to be a dimer with a carbohydrate moeity. A low molecular weight chemical found in the induced reaction zone could not be identified by mass spectroscopy. 3aDendroctonus rufipennis 3amonoterpenoids 3aPicea glauca 3aPicea sitchensis 3aAlaska 0amechanical wounding 0aleptographium abietinum 0apicea lutzii 0aPicea 0ablue stain1 aIllman, B.L.0 tEnvironmental entomology.g1994 Apr., v. 23, no. 2 p.472-478x0046-225X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ee/23.2.4723Available from publisher's Web site  a19940802b19940811c00000000  aINDdTLX  aOther US 7aarticle02885naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002900092040001800121100001600139245015700155300001600312520173100328650001002059650001002069650001602079650001002095650002902105650003102134650002402165650001602189650002102205650001102226653001602237700001702253773008202270852000902352856007902361930003302440945001302473946001302486655001202499IND2040993720221120105318.0940722e199404  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204099372DNAL7 a10.1093/ee/23.2.4472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGrant, G.G.10aOviposition responses of four Choristoneura (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae) species to chemical and physical stimuli associated with host and nonhost foliage  ap. 447-456.  aOviposition responses of three conifer-feeding Choristoneura species (C. fumiferana [Clemens], C. occidentalis Freeman, and C. pinus Freeman) and one deciduous-feeding Choristoneura species (C. conflictana [Walker]) to host cues were studied in arenas containing filter paper as the main oviposition substrate. Generally, all species laid more eggs on filter paper treated with hexane extracts of host foliage than with hexane alone, but the number of eggs deposited per egg mass was not significantly different. For the conifer-feeding species, the stimulating effect of host chemicals was independent of physical stimuli associated with host foliage. Oviposition by C. fumiferana females was also stimulated by extracts of nonhost conifers and trembling aspen, a deciduous species. C. pinus and C. occidentalis were stimulated by some nonhost coniferous extracts but not by extracts of trembling aspen. C. conflictana females were not stimulated by coniferous extracts. Oviposition responses to host physical stimuli were evaluated with artificial (plastic) coniferous twigs with needle lengths of 1.25, 2.5, or 3.5 cm. In most cases, females of the conifer-feeding species preferred the artificial twigs to the filter-paper substrate. Needle lengths of the preferred twigs corresponded to the range of needle lengths found on the hosts of each species. C. conflictana oviposited exclusively on the filter-paper substrate, which corresponds to the flat surface of aspen leaves. When given a choice between ovipositing on surrogate twigs or on filter paper treated with host extract, C. fumiferana females preferred the surrogate twigs, suggesting that the effects of tactile cues predominated over close-range chemical cues. 3aAbies 3aPicea 3aPseudotsuga 3aPinus 3aChoristoneura fumiferana 3aChoristoneura occidentalis 3aChoristoneura pinus 3aoviposition 3ahost preferences 3aleaves 0astimulation1 aLangevin, D.0 tEnvironmental entomology.g1994 Apr., v. 23, no. 2 p.447-456x0046-225X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ee/23.2.4473Available from publisher's Web site  a19940802b19940811c00000000  aINDdTLX  aOther US 7aarticle03371naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100001600171245009600187300001600283520165500299650002001954650001301974650001601987650001202003650000902015650001602024650001302040650000902053650001602062650002202078650001202100650003402112650002002146650001702166650002502183650002802208650001302236650002802249650004002277650002302317653001702340653002602357653002502383653002402408700001902432700002102451700001802472700002002490700001602510773011002526852000902636856009202645930003302737946001102770655001202781IND4440272620221120105435.0100723e201008  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444027262DNAL7 a204442332pmid7 a10.1111/j.1365-313X.2010.04245.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHaring, Max14aThe role of DNA methylation, nucleosome occupancy and histone modifications in paramutation  ap. 366-378.  aParamutation is the transfer of epigenetic information between alleles that leads to a heritable change in expression of one of these alleles. Paramutation at the tissue-specifically expressed maize (Zea mays) b1 locus involves the low-expressing B′ and high-expressing B-I allele. Combined in the same nucleus, B′ heritably changes B-I into B′. A hepta-repeat located 100-kb upstream of the b1 coding region is required for paramutation and for high b1 expression. The role of epigenetic modifications in paramutation is currently not well understood. In this study, we show that the B′ hepta-repeat is DNA-hypermethylated in all tissues analyzed. Importantly, combining B′ and B-I in one nucleus results in de novo methylation of the B-I repeats early in plant development. These findings indicate a role for hepta-repeat DNA methylation in the establishment and maintenance of the silenced B′ state. In contrast, nucleosome occupancy, H3 acetylation, and H3K9 and H3K27 methylation are mainly involved in tissue-specific regulation of the hepta-repeat. Nucleosome depletion and H3 acetylation are tissue-specifically regulated at the B-I hepta-repeat and associated with enhancement of b1 expression. H3K9 and H3K27 methylation are tissue-specifically localized at the B′ hepta-repeat and reinforce the silenced B′ chromatin state. The B′ coding region is H3K27 dimethylated in all tissues analyzed, indicating a role in the maintenance of the silenced B′ state. Taken together, these findings provide insight into the mechanisms underlying paramutation and tissue-specific regulation of b1 at the level of chromatin structure. 3aDNA methylation 3aZea mays 3aacetylation 3aalleles 3acorn 3aepigenetics 3ahistones 3aloci 3anucleosomes 3aplant development 3atissues 2aChromatin Immunoprecipitation 2aDNA Methylation 2aGenes, Plant 2aHistonesxmetabolism 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aMutation 2aNucleosomesxmetabolism 2aReal-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction 2aZea maysxgenetics 0aparamutation 0ahistone modifications 0anucleosome occupancy 0achromatin structure1 aBader, Rechien1 aLouwers, Marieke1 aSchwabe, Anne1 avan Driel, Roel1 aStam, Maike0 tPlant journal.g2010 Aug., v. 63, no. 3 p.366-378dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0960-74127nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-313X.2010.04245.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20100723b20100807c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02849naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092024002200127024001900149040001800168100002900186245014200215300001600357500001500373520147200388650001301860650001201873650001401885650001401899653001301913700002601926700002001952700002101972700002401993700002102017700002302038700002202061700002102083700002502104700002102129773011502150852000902265856008502274939003302359946001102392655001202403IND4449627220221120094851.0110225e201103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444962722DNAL7 a10.1007/s10552-010-9714-32doi7 aPMC30421012pmcid7 a211842622pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBertram, Lisa A.

The aim of this study was to determine whether baseline activity and 1-year change in activity are associated with breast cancer events or mortality. Methods A total of 2,361 post-treatment breast cancer survivors (Stage I-III) enrolled in a randomized controlled trial of dietary change completed physical activity measures at baseline and one year. Physical activity variables (total, moderate-vigorous, and adherence to guidelines) were calculated for each time point. Median follow-up was 7.1 years. Outcomes were invasive breast cancer events and all-cause mortality. Results Those who were most active at baseline had a 53% lower mortality risk compared to the least active women (HR = 0.47; 95% CI: 0.26, 0.84; p = .01). Adherence to activity guidelines was associated with a 35% lower mortality risk (HR = 0.65, 95% CI: 0.47, 0.91; p < .01). Neither baseline nor 1-year change in activity was associated with additional breast cancer events. Conclusions Higher baseline (post-treatment) physical activity was associated with improved survival. However, change in activity over the following year was not associated with outcomes. These data suggest that long-term physical activity levels are important for breast cancer prognosis. 3aexercise 3arelapse 3alifestyle 3amortality 0abehavior1 aStefanick, Marcia L. 1 aSaquib, Nazmus 1 aNatarajan, Loki 1 aPatterson, Ruth E. 1 aBardwell, Wayne 1 aFlatt, Shirley W. 1 aNewman, Vicky A. 1 aRock, Cheryl L. 1 aThomson, Cynthia A. 1 aPierce, John P. 0 tCancer causes & control.g2011 Mar., v. 22, no. 3 p.427-435dDordrecht : Springer Netherlandsx0957-52437nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10552-010-9714-33Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b20110305c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02436naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100003600145245008000181300001600261520131400277650002101591653002601612653001301638653001601651700002001667700003001687700001701717700002101734700002201755700002201777700002001799773011701819852000901936856008501945930003302030946001102063655001202074IND4444010220221120095000.0101022e201011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444401022DNAL7 a10.1007/s10549-010-1178-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRichter-Ehrenstein, Christiane 10aSolid neuroendocrine carcinomas of the breast: metastases or primary tumors  ap. 413-417.  aNeuroendocrine breast carcinomas are rare but may represent either metastatic or primary lesions.

We addressed this study in order to evaluate the immunohistochemical expression of GCDFP-15 and mammaglobin in a subset of pure neuroendocrine breast carcinomas (n = 9) and compared the expression profile with a cohort of non-mammary neuroendocrine tumors (n = 99). We observed in our study that solid neuroendocrine breast carcinomas are characterized by the expression of estrogen and progesterone receptors as well as GCDFP-15 and/or mammaglobin. GCDFP-15 was expressed in 6 out of 9 cases, mammaglobin was positive in 4 out of 9 tumors. In contrast, neuroendocrine tumors of the non-mammary cohort expressed neither GCDFP-15 nor mammaglobin. We conclude that mammaglobin and GCDFP-15 as markers of epithelial breast origin may work as a new and reliable diagnostic tool to distinguish primary endocrine tumors of the breast from a metastatic neuroendocrine disease. This is of utmost importance, especially for surgical management. 3abreast neoplasms 0aNeuroendocrine tumors 0aGCDFP-15 0aMammaglobin1 aArndt, Juliane 1 aBuckendahl, Ann-Christin 1 aEucker, Jan 1 aWeichert, Wilko 1 aKasajima, Atsuko 1 aSchneider, Achim 1 aNoske, Aurelia 0 tBreast cancer research and treatment.g2010 Nov., v. 124, no. 2 p.413-417dBoston : Springer USx0167-68067nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10549-010-1178-33Available from publisher's Web site  a20101022b20101108c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02765naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002400145245014000169300001600309500002400325520146500349650001501814650001101829650001601840650001001856650004301866650003301909650001201942650001701954650002601971650001201997700002302009700002202032700001902054700002102073700001802094700001702112700003102129700002002160773009402180852000902274856004802283655001202331IND4428400520221120085048.0091106e200911  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442840052DNAL7 a10.1007/s11557-009-0609-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFazio, Alejandra T.10aCulture studies on the mycobiont isolated from Parmotrema reticulatum (Taylor) Choisy: metabolite production under different conditions  ap. 359-365.  aIncludes references  aA strain of the lichen mycobiont isolated from a thallus of Parmotrema reticulatum was cultured axenically on different media. The morphology, anatomy, growth of the colonies, and metabolite production were studied. The isolated fungal colonies developed well and showed a remarkable morphogenetic capacity on most of the assayed solid media, e.g., malt extract 2%-yeast extract 0.2% (MEYE), malt extract 1%-yeast extract 0.4%-sucrose 10% (MY10), and the original Lilly & Barnett medium (LB). The identity of the isolated fungus was confirmed by its ITS rDNA-sequence. Atranorin, the major cortical lichen depside, was produced when the colonies were grown over 5 and 10 months on solid LB medium, combined with a dessication treatment. Atranorin was identified by matching of UV spectra obtained from HPLC running and a reference substance in a spectrum library. Colonies grown on MEYE and MY10 with a dessication treatment did not produce any lichen secondary metabolite. Mycobionts grown for 5 months on solid MEYE without a dessication treatment produced triacylglycerides as the major metabolites, and the fatty acids were characterized as their methyl esters. Analysis by TLC and HPLC-DAD of extracts of colonies grown on LB and MY10 without dessication revealed that the typical secondary compounds of the natural lichen were not produced. The major metabolites of the natural lichen thallus were identified by chromatographic and spectroscopic methods. 3aParmotrema 3aesters 3afatty acids 3afungi 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3ainternal transcribed spacers 3alichens 3amalt extract 3asecondary metabolites 3athallus1 aBertoni, María D.1 aAdler, Mónica T.1 aRuiz, Laura B.1 aRosso, María L.1 aMuggia, Lucia1 aHager, Armin1 aStocker-Wörgötter, Elfie1 aMaier, Marta S.0 tMycological progress.g2009 Nov., v. 8, no. 4 p.359-365dSpringer-Verlagx1617-416X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11557-009-0609-1 7aarticle02488naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002600152245011700178300001400295500002400309520106900333650001101402650002201413650001701435650002001452650002301472650002801495650001201523650002001535650001801555650001801573650001501591650001201606650001501618650001501633650001801648650001601666650002001682650002501702650001701727650001701744650002801761651001001789700002301799773010801822852000901930856005501939655001201994IND4448039520221120072801.0110125e201101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444803952DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1471-0366.2010.00282.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCHALLIES, EDWARD R.T.14aThe Interaction of Global Value Chains and Rural Livelihoods: The Case of Smallholder Raspberry Growers in Chile  ap. 29-59.  aIncludes references  aThis paper integrates aspects of global value chain and sustainable rural livelihoods analyses in an exploration of the local impacts of agri-food globalization in Chile. In particular, it examines the evolution of the raspberry export sector in the context of Chile's non-traditional agricultural export boom, and considers its importance to smallholder growers and rural households in central Chile. The paper first outlines the geography and structural configuration of the global value chain for Chilean raspberries, and considers modes of governance and forms of coordination between key actors within the chain. Second, the terms and implications of smallholder grower participation in the value chain are explored in a discussion of access to key livelihoods assets. The paper concludes that institutional support to smallholders, even in the case of a crop that is widely seen to have a small-scale ‘size bias', remains integral to their capacity to comply with required safety and quality standards and gain and retain market access via the value chain. 3aassets 3acollective action 3acooperatives 3aeconomic impact 3aeconomic structure 3aeconomic sustainability 3aexports 3afood production 3afruit growing 3aglobalization 3agovernance 3agrowers 3ahouseholds 3alivelihood 3amarket access 3araspberries 3arural economics 3asectoral development 3astakeholders 3asupply chain 3asustainable agriculture 3aChile1 aMurray, Warwick E.0 tJournal of agrarian change.g2011 Jan., v. 11, no. 1 p.29-59dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx1471-03587nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1471-0366.2010.00282.x 7aarticle02662naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100003000110245010300140300001600243520123100259650001601490650002001506650001201526650002101538650001101559650001701570650001901587650001501606650003401621650001001655650001001665650001201675650002201687650001401709650004001723650001401763650002901777650002301806650001501829650002101844651001101865700002801876700002801904773007601932852000902008856010502017939003302122946001302155655001202168IND4478503920221120064630.0140317e200206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447850392DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFontanive, Roberta Santos10aComparison between the nutritional status of eutrophic and overweight adolescents living in Brazil  ap. 667-678.  aThe present study aimed to compare the nutritional status of normal and overweight adolescents. Sixty-four girls (36 normal-weight and 28 overweight) aged between 12 and 18 years were evaluated. Weight, height, body mass index and abdominal circumference were determined. Values of glucose, red blood cells, cholesterol and cholesterol fractions were analyzed. The diet history method and a food frequency questionnaire were used in order to obtain the quantitative and qualitative profiles of each participant’s diet. The amount of total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, triglycerides and glucose were increased in the group of overweight adolescents as compared with the normal group, although no statistically significant differences could be found. The diet history showed that there was no difference between the groups regarding ingestion of energy and nutrients. Both groups presented high protein diets and calcium and folic acid ingestion below recommended values. The food frequency questionnaire showed an increased ingestion of fatty foods by the overweight adolescents when compared with the normal group. Thus there is a need for nutritional intervention in these adolescents in order to prevent chronic diseases. 3aadolescents 3abody mass index 3acalcium 3achronic diseases 3aenergy 3aerythrocytes 3aeutrophication 3afolic acid 3afood frequency questionnaires 3afoods 3agirls 3aglucose 3ahigh protein diet 3aingestion 3alow density lipoprotein cholesterol 3anutrients 3anutritional intervention 3anutritional status 3aoverweight 3atriacylglycerols 3aBrazil1 aCosta, Rosana Salles da1 aAbreu Soares, Elaine de0 tNutrition research.g2002 June, v. 22, no. 6 p.667-678x0271-53177nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.nrjournal.com/issues?issue_key=S0271-5317(00)X0086-33Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b00000000c20140317  aOther US 7aarticle03808naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003000092040001800122100001600140245012700156300001800283520273700301650001803038650002303056650002103079650001603100650003003116650002203146650002403168700001503192700001903207773008403226852000903310856008003319930003303399945001303432946001303445655001203458IND2039121020221120055140.0940428e199312  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203912102DNAL7 a10.1093/ee/22.6.12172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHeinz, K.M.10aToward predictable biological control of Liriomyza trifolii (Diptera: Agromyzidae) infesting greenhouse cut chrysanthemums  ap. 1217-1233.  aImplementation of augmentative biological control is often hindered by the inability to obtain accurate information on natural enemy release rates that will ultimately yield a salable crop within economic constraints. The purpose of this study was to develop and evaluate a computer model that attempts to predict augmentative releases of the parasitoid Diglyphus begini (Ashmead) (Hymenoptera: Eulophidae) to use for biological control against the serpentine leafminer Liriomyza trifolii (Burgess) (Diptera: Agromyzidae) infesting greenhouse-grown cut chrysanthemums. The model attempts to determine the appropriate release rate necessary to reduce leafminer densities below 1 larvae per 1,000 chrysanthemum leaves within 40 d after planting, after which time aesthetically important foliage forms on chrysanthemums. In the construction of this deterministic model, three simplifying assumptions have been made: (1) there is no insect movement between the greenhouse and outside, (2) greenhouse temperatures are a constant 27 degrees C, and (3) the greenhouse represents a homogeneous environment. Model simulations indicated that successful biological control was unlikely when parasitoid releases are initiated later than 14 d after planting regardless of the release rate. The simulations also demonstrated that D. begini release rates are not linearly related to L. trifolii densities, and that a parasitoid release strategy is not simply the determination of a proper wasp/leafminer ratio. Validation studies of the model's predictions provided mixed results. Following the release rates generated by the model, L. trifolii larval densities were not significantly greater than I per 1,000 leaves 40 d after planting. However, the model did not always track the succession and magnitude of leafminer population fluctuations with statistical accuracy. Two factors probably contributed to these errors in prediction: (1) the assumptions inherent to the model were not met during the validation trials, and (2) the leafminer subroutine of the model could not accurately predict L. trifolii densities in the absence of D. begini. In spite of these errors, leafminer damage to the harvested foliage was significantly lower in the treatments receiving D. begini releases than in the control treatments. In addition, when the model was tested in a commercial cut chrysanthemum greenhouse, L. trifolii was successfully controlled by releases of D. begini, resulting in the production and harvest of a salable cut chrysanthemum crop without the use of any pesticides. Finally, postvalidation reconstruction of the model, to include temperature-dependent variation in life history parameters, increased the predictive power of the model. 3aChrysanthemum 3aLiriomyza trifolii 3aDiglyphus begini 3aparasitoids 3abiological control agents 3asimulation models 3acomputer techniques1 aNunney, L.1 aParrella, M.P.0 tEnvironmental entomology.g1993 Dec., v. 22, no. 6 p.1217-1233x0046-225X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ee/22.6.12173Available from publisher's Web site  a19940603b19940609c00000000  aINDdTLX  aOther US 7aarticle01494naa a2200325 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100002700115245008300142300001400225300002800239500001500267520060500282650000900887650002200896650002000918650001600938650002000954650001600974653001200990700002001002773007101022852000901093939003301102945000801135946001301143655001201156991610536060742620221120055139.0851203e198402  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI850083582DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBakanowski, Stephen M.10aEndpoint temperature distributions in microwave and conventionally cooked pork  ap. 45-51.  ap. 45-51. ill., charts.  a2019-12-05  aHeating patterns in microwaved and conventionally cooked pork are defined and quantified, and a basic understanding of the mechanisms of microwave heating compared with conventional cooking techniques is provided.

First, 500 fresh, laboratory-infected fly cadavers were placed weekly for 10 wk inside barns in areas of high fly activity. Second, 2,500 living, infected flies were released on each of two occasions spaced 3 wk apart. Releases were started in mid-June. Three farms were used for each treatment plus three control farms. The E. muscae used for the releases had been isolated from house flies collected from dairies the year before and had been maintained by continuous fly-to-fly passage. Prevalence rates on both types of E. muscae release farms were twice as high (23-28%) as on control farms (12%) in the weeks after the start of the releases. Releases were more effective on farms with high fly populations than on farms with low fly populations. Examination of conidia indicated that the released strain (8-18 nuclei per conidium) became established as a result of the releases. Epizootics occurred on all farms, including controls, in September through November. Infections in the spring were exclusively with a strain of E. muscae with 2-8 nuclei per conidium; by fall, most infections (86-93%) were with a strain with 8-18 nuclei per conidium, even on control farms. Nuclear densities in the laboratory culture remained constant at 8-18 nuclei per conidium during this shift in wild infections. Neither of the E. muscae treatments significantly reduced fly populations. 3adairy farming 3aMusca domestica 3aEntomophthora muscae 3aentomopathogenic fungi 3abiological control agents 3apathogenicity 3aNew York1 aSteinkraus, D.C.1 aRutz, D.A.0 tEnvironmental entomology.g1993 Oct., v. 22, no. 5 p.1201-1208x0046-225X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ee/22.5.12013Available from publisher's Web site  a19940305b19940310c00000000  aINDdTLX  aOther US 7aarticle02171naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245012600127300001600253520104800269650001201317650002101329650001201350650002101362650001001383650003101393650001601424700002301440700001801463700002101481700001901502700002101521700002001542773007501562852000901637856010501646939003301751946001301784655001201797IND4478503220221120041237.0140317e200205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447850322DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTorbay, Naji10aHigh protein vs high carbohydrate hypoenergetic diet in treatment of obese normoinsulinemic and hyperinsulinemic subjects  ap. 587-598.  aThis study tests the hypothesis that hyperinsulinemic (HI) obese subjects respond differently from normoinsulinemics (NI) to changes in composition of hypoenergetic diets. Twenty-seven obese male subjects, 13 HI and 14 NI, were fed for 4 weeks either a high protein (HP) or a high carbohydrate (HC) hypoenergetic diet providing 80% of their resting energy expenditure (REE). On the HP diet weight loss was significantly higher in HI as compared to NI group. Alternatively, the HI group lost less weight than NI group on the HC diet. The HC diets resulted in a considerable and similar reduction in REE in both HI and NI groups as opposed to the HP diet, which maintained REE in both HI and NI. A higher decrease and normalization of fasting insulin levels was observed in the HI group on the HP as compared to HC diet. In conclusion, hyperinsulinemic, in contrast to normoinsulinemic obese subjects, seem to achieve better weight reduction, less decline in energy expenditure, and normalization of insulin levels on HP than isocaloric HC diet. 3afasting 3ahyperinsulinemia 3ainsulin 3alow calorie diet 3amales 3aresting energy expenditure 3aweight loss1 aBaba, Nahla Hwalla1 aSawaya, Sally1 aBajjani, Rudeina1 aHabbal, Zuheir1 aʻĀzar, Sāmī.1 aHashim, Sami A.0 tNutrition research.g2002 May, v. 22, no. 5 p.587-598x0271-53177nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.nrjournal.com/issues?issue_key=S0271-5317(00)X0084-X3Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b00000000c20140317  aOther US 7aarticle03564naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002900092040001800121100001800139245014500157300001600302500001500318520247600333650002502809650001302834650002102847653002102868653001402889700001702903700001802920700001302938700002202951773008202973852000903055856007903064930003303143945001303176946001303189655001203202IND2040986220221120033247.0940722e199404  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204098622DNAL7 a10.1093/ee/23.2.3042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aProkopy, R.J.10aInteractive effects of resource abundance and state of adults on residence of apple maggot (Diptera: Tephritidae) flies in host tree patches  ap. 304-315.  a2019-12-04  aIn open-field patches of five potted host trees containing varying amounts of proteinaceous food and host hawthorn fruit, we investigated the comparative influence of varying fly physiological and experiential states on the location and duration of residence of 18-d-old released apple maggot, Rhagoletis pomonella (Walsh), females. Several patterns of fly response were consistent with our preexperimental expectation. Thus, duration of residence was greater in patches where proteinaceous food and host fruit were present on all trees than in patches where either or both resources were absent from one or more trees, largely irrespective of fly physiological or experiential state. Flies that had no access to protein up to day of release (low egg load flies) were sighted in greater numbers on proteinaceous food than were flies that had continuous access to protein up to day of release (high egg load flies), whereas the reverse was true for flies sighted on host fruit. Flies that had partial access to protein up to day of release (intermediate egg load flies) were sighted in intermediate numbers on proteinaceous food and fruit. Flies that had continuous access to protein tip to day of release were observed in greatest numbers on fruit if they received brief experience with fruit (as opposed to water or proteinaceous food) just before release. Presence on fruit of flies that had partial access to protein up to day of release was unaffected by type of brief experience just before release. Some patterns of fly response were not consistent with our preexperimental expectation. Thus, flies that had no or partial access to protein up to day of release were observed in fewer numbers (not greater or equal numbers, respectively) on proteinaceous food if they had brief experience with proteinaceous food just before release compared with brief experience with water or fruit. Flies that had no access to protein up to day of release and received brief experience with proteinaceous food just before release were found on tree foliage and in total in greater numbers (not equal numbers) than flies that had continuous access to protein up to day of release and received brief experience with fruit just before release. These and other findings are discussed in relation to previous knowledge of the resource foraging behavior of tephritid flies and in relation to improvement of behavioral methods of managing R. pomonella flies in commercial apple orchards. 3aRhagoletis pomonella 3aforaging 3aCrataegus mollis 0afeeding behavior 0aCrataegus1 aCooley, S.S.1 aProkopy, J.J.1 aQuan, Q.1 aBuonaccorsi, J.P.0 tEnvironmental entomology.g1994 Apr., v. 23, no. 2 p.304-315x0046-225X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ee/23.2.3043Available from publisher's Web site  a19940802b19940811c00000000  aINDdTLX  aOther US 7aarticle02292naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002500092040001800117100001800135245011300153300001800266500002300284520109200307650001801399650001501417650001701432650002901449650002201478650002601500650002201526650002001548650001401568653001701582653001301599700001701612700001501629773009701644852000901741856007501750930003301825945001301858946001101871655001201882IND2331673520221117172141.0030328e200208  onc|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233167352DNAL7 a10.1139/x02-0572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSimon, N.P.P.10aSongbird abundance in clear-cut and burned stands: a comparison of natural disturbance and forest management  ap. 1343-1350.  aSummary in French.  aTo evaluate the efficacy of forest management to emulate natural disturbance, we compared bird abundances among burned and clear-cut, former black spruce (Picea mariana (Mill.) BSP) sites, after 5, 14, and 27 years of succession. Total bird density was lower in clear-cut sites resulting from fewer hermit thrushes, yellow warblers, Swainson's thrushes, and fox sparrows. Hermit thrushes were positively correlated with snag density while yellow warblers and Swainson's thrushes were positively associated with deciduous tree cover and negatively correlated with conifer cover. Only yellow-rumped warblers had higher densities on clear-cut sites, likely due to greater conifer cover. Bird densities and species richness peaked in the 14-year-old burns and exceeded that of mature forests reported for Labrador. This demonstrates the importance of natural early successional forests for birds. Although logged areas support several species found in natural young burns, logging does not precisely mimic fire. This suggests that forest managers should allow some forests to burn naturally. 3aPicea mariana 3awild birds 3aclearcutting 3awildland fire management 3aforest management 3aecological succession 3aspecies diversity 3adisturbed soils 3adead wood 0aground cover 0aefficacy1 aSchwab, F.E.1 aOtto, R.D.0 tCanadian journal of forest research =.g2002 Aug., v. 32, no. 8 p.1343-1350x0045-50677nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/x02-0573Available from publisher's Web site  a20030602b20030603c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle02294naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002000110245012700130300001800257520098200275650002101257650002301278650001101301650001401312650001001326650001501336650001101351650001101362650001601373650001901389650001301408650001101421650002801432650001101460650001001471700002801481700002601509700002001535700002001555700002201575773007901597852000901676856010501685939003301790946001301823655001201836IND4479232120221117172119.0140331e200311  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447923212DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGråsten, Soile10aEffects of wheat pentosan and inulin on the metabolic activity of fecal microbiota and on bowel function in healthy humans  ap. 1503-1514.  aThe effects of wheat pentosan and inulin on the metabolic activity of fecal microbiota and on bowel function were compared in healthy humans. In a parallel study 14 subjects consumed daily for three weeks 13 g of wheat pentosan or inulin baked in wheat bread. Activities of bacterial enzymes (β-glucuronidase, β-glucosidase, urease) and concentrations of bacterial metabolites (short chain fatty acids, phenol, p-cresol) in feces, bowel function and intestinal symptoms were measured at the beginning and end of the intervention period. Changes in most parameters studied were similar in subjects receiving pentosan or inulin bread, but pentosan increased total SCFA (P = 0.048) and butyrate (P = 0.009) concentrations in feces more than inulin. Pentosan also increased the occurrence of flatulence (P < 0.05). Pentosan appears to be more easily fermented than inulin, and due to the increase in the fecal butyrate concentration may have favourable effects on colonic health. 3abeta-glucosidase 3abeta-glucuronidase 3abreads 3abutyrates 3afeces 3aflatulence 3ahumans 3ainulin 3ametabolites 3amicroorganisms 3ap-cresol 3aphenol 3ashort chain fatty acids 3aurease 3awheat1 aLiukkonen, Kirsi-Helena1 aChrevatidis, Angeliki1 aEl-Nezami, Hani1 aPoutanen, Kaisa1 aMykkänen, Hannu.0 tNutrition research.g2003 Nov., v. 23, no. 11 p.1503-1514x0271-53177nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.nrjournal.com/issues?issue_key=S0271-5317(00)X0102-93Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b00000000c20140331  aOther US 7aarticle03243naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002500092040001800117100001800135245014000153300001800293500002300311500001500334520159700349650002101946650001701967650001301984650002101997650001502018650001402033650001702047650002602064650001302090650001102103650002002114650001202134650001702146650001102163650001402174650001902188650002102207650001002228651001102238653001502249653002302264653001102287653002102298700001602319700001702335700001502352700001702367700001802384773009802402852000902500856007502509930003302584945001302617946001102630655001202641IND2331616220221117172127.0030326e200111  onc|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233161622DNAL7 a10.1139/x01-1342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLamhamedi, M.10aGrowth, physiology, and leachate losses in Picea glauca seedlings (1+0) grown in air-slit containers under different irrigation regimes  ap. 1968-1980.  aSummary in French.  a2019-12-04  aIn production tunnels, time domain reflectometry (TDR) was used to manage irrigation and leaching by controlling water content in the rhizosphere of air-slit containerized white spruce (Picea glauca (Moench) Voss) seedlings (1+0). Seedlings were exposed to four irrigation regimes (v/v: IR-60%, IR-45%, IR-30%, and IR-15%) during the first growing season to assess IR effects on growth, gas exchange, nutrient uptake, carbohydrates, root architecture, and leaching. In the province of Quebec, seedling producers generally maintain a high substrate water content (>50%, v/v) during all growth phases. The accuracy and feasibility of using TDR to decrease irrigation without affecting the material attributes of the seedlings at the end of the first growing season was confirmed. However, seedlings grown under IR-15% had significantly lower height, root collar diameter, shoot and root dry masses, root surface, root length, net photosynthesis, and nutrient contents than seedlings grown under IR-30%, IR-45%, and IR-60%. In comparison with IR-30% and IR-45%, the application of IR-60% produced no increase in shoot or root growth, mineral nutrition, and carbohydrates. Seedlings grown under IR-15%, IR-30%, and IR-45% used approximately 28, 37, and 46%, respectively, of the amount of water applied under IR-60%. Nutrient losses including anions and cations under IR-60% were higher in comparison with the other IRs. Maintaining a water content in the rhizosphere that changes with the stage of seedling development is suggested to optimize growth and to avoid excess irrigation and leaching. 3anutrient content 3aroot systems 3adiameter 3aforest nurseries 3airrigation 3aseedlings 3agas exchange 3aplant characteristics 3aleaching 3aheight 3anutrient uptake 3acations 3aPicea glauca 3aanions 3aleachates 3aphotosynthesis 3aplant physiology 3aroots 3aQuebec 0adry matter 0awater availability 0agrowth 0aplant morphology1 aLambany, G.1 aMargolis, H.1 aRenaud, M.1 aVeilleux, L.1 aBernier, P.Y.0 tCanadian journal of forest research =.g2001 Nov., v. 31, no. 11 p.1968-1980x0045-50677nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/x01-1343Available from publisher's Web site  a20030602b20030603c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle01354naa a2200277 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100001900115245006700134300001600201300002400217520059000241650002300831650001700854650002000871650001500891653002100906773007400927852000901001939003301010945000801043946001301051655001201064991610530510742620221123040442.0860520e198511  xx ||||go|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI860103322DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMastrian, L.K.10aSensory evaluation program within a small processing operation  ap. 127-129.  ap. 127-129. charts.  aThe specific needs and characteristics of a sensory evaluation program for small food processing plants are discussed.

Engelm.) growing over a 24-km2 study site in central Oregon. We compared the effects of infection and associated witches' brooms with those of site topography, soil type, shrub cover, stand density, and the abundance of mature ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa Dougl. ex P. Laws. & C. Laws). using multiple regression and path analysis. The density of dominant-size P. contorta was consistently the most important factor influencing HCT, HCB, and LCR across the study site. In dense stands, trees tended to have elevated crown bases due to self-pruning and, hence, lower values of LCR. Dwarf mistletoe and related witches' brooms uniquely explained 6.9% of the variance in LCR, which was close to that of dominant P. contorta (7.1%) and more than that of soil type (3.0%), but explained only 2.6% of the variance in HCB, which was less than that of dominant P. contorta (6.5%) and soil type (4.6%). Regression models suggest that heavily infected trees should be 18% shorter and have crown bases 37% lower than uninfected trees, while moderately infected trees should have an LCR over 20% larger than that of uninfected and heavily infected trees. We also found that the largest 25 heavily infected trees sampled were approximately 19% shorter and 11-13% smaller in diameter than the largest 25 uninfected trees. The results suggest that dwarf mistletoe can be an important factor in determining the crown dimensions of P. contorta but that these effects may be interpreted only in the context of site characteristics and stand structure. 3atopography 3aArceuthobium americanum 3adiameter 3abotanical composition 3aplant characteristics 3aheight 3aPinus contorta 3astand density 3aPinus ponderosa 3aforest soils 3aunderstory 3aOregon 0aplant communities 0acrown 0ainfestation 0awitches' brooms 0aratios1 aTinnin, R.O.1 aForbes, R.B.0 tCanadian journal of forest research.g2002 Aug., v. 32, no. 8 p.1360-1371wJournal:jnl2003x0045-50677nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/x02-0583Available from publisher's Web site  a20030602b20030603c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle01704naa a2200301 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100001800115245006900133300001400202300002300216520087200239650001201111650001001123650001701133650002701150650002401177650003101201653002301232773007201255852000901327939003301336945000801369946001301377655001201390991610529580742620221123023553.0860428e198511  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI860103282DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKokini, J.

The aggregated species consume large quantities of the easily available pellets lost from cages. As a consequence, the physical condition of farm-associated wild fish is increased and their physiology is altered. These changes may influence local fisheries as many of these aggregating species are targeted by fishers. We assess whether local fishers catch wild fish that have previously aggregated at fish farms by comparing the body condition, trophic indexes, diet overlap and the fatty acid (FA) composition of B. boops obtained from local fish markets and around fish farms. Bogue captured by trammel-nets and around fish farms facilities presented a similar biological condition, as well as high quantities of pellets in the gut, and their FA profile was affected by vegetal-derived FAs. In contrast, bogue captured by trawlers were not influenced by fish farms, as they consumed natural trophic resources. We conclude that artisanal fishers exploit these aggregated fish populations once they have dispersed away from farms, and benefit from a ‘biomass export' from fish farms at a local scale. 3abiomass 3abody condition 3acages 3acase studies 3adiet 3adigestive system 3afatty acids 3afish farms 3afisheries 3afishery resources 3afishing boats 3amariculture 3amarkets 3apellets 3atraditional technology 3awild fish1 aSanchez-Jerez, Pablo1 aBayle-Sempere, Just1 aFernandez-Jover, Damián1 aMartinez-Rubio, Laura1 aLópez Jiménez, José Ángel.1 aMartínez López, Francisco Javier.0 tAquaculture research.g2011 June, v. 42, no. 7 p.996-1010dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx1355-557X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2109.2010.02683.x 7aarticle02188naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002500092040001800117100002200135245011600157300001800273500002300291520090000314650001101214650002601225650002101251650001801272650001901290650001201309650002201321650002201343650001501365650002201380650002401402651001201426651001301438651001401451700002001465700001801485773009801503852000901601856007501610930003301685945001301718946001101731655001201742IND2331614820221123023638.0030326e200111  onc|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233161482DNAL7 a10.1139/x01-1232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCosta E Silva, J.10aAnalysis of early tree height in forest genetic trials is enhanced by including a spatially correlated residual  ap. 1887-1893.  aSummary in French.  aThis study explores the use of a mixed linear model including spatially correlated residuals in addition to the traditional randomized complete block (RCB) analysis in 12 forest genetic trials. The analysis of early height data from progeny and clonal tests of three species (Picea sitchensis (Bong.) Carr., Pinus pinaster Ait., and Pinus radiata D. Don) showed that there was significant spatial variation in all trials. Adding a basic first-order separable autoregressive error term more effectively modelled the spatial variation than the RCB model and greatly reduced the block and plot variances. There was no evidence that extended spatial modelling was required. The spatial analysis greatly improved the accuracy of genetic value estimation in some trials and was accompanied by large changes in rank of the genetic entries and by greater gains in selection relative to the RCB analysis. 3aheight 3aplant characteristics 3aPicea sitchensis 3aPinus radiata 3aPinus pinaster 3aforests 3agenetic variation 3aspatial variation 3aestimation 3asimulation models 3agenetic improvement 3aDenmark 3aPortugal 3aAustralia1 aDutkowski, G.W.1 aGilmour, A.R.0 tCanadian journal of forest research =.g2001 Nov., v. 31, no. 11 p.1887-1893x0045-50677nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/x01-1233Available from publisher's Web site  a20030602b20030603c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle02949naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127072001700144100001400161245007900175300001600254520152200270650001401792650002201806650001901828650002101847650001401868650002901882650002401911650002701935650003101962650001601993650001702009650001802026650002602044650001502070650001502085650001302100650001602113650002302129650001602152650001102168651001702179700001702196700001802213700001902231773007702250852000902327930003302336945002502369946001302394655001202407IND4376998820221123020053.0060105e200511  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437699882DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aBreet, P.10aActions of black tea and Rooibos on iron status of primary school children  ap. 983-994.  aThe aim of this study was to compare the effects of black tea and Rooibos on the iron status of primary school children. This parallel intervention trial included 175 children who were randomly allocated to receive 2 200-mL servings of either black tea or Rooibos daily with milk and sugar. The children received antihelminthic treatment (500 mg mebendazole) at baseline. Hemoglobin, hematocrit, serum iron, ferritin, and transferrin were measured, and total iron binding capacity and transferrin saturation were calculated. Dietary intakes were measured by means of 24-hour dietary recalls, and anthropometric measurements were taken. A malnourished population in anthropometric indices and nutrient intakes was identified. Biochemical markers of iron status also indicated a population at risk for iron depletion. Children in the black tea group had significantly higher hemoglobin concentrations, and children in both groups had significantly higher mean corpuscular volume, transferrin, and total iron binding capacity after the intervention. Changes in biochemical parameters did not differ significantly between the 2 groups. During the intervention period, the changes in dietary intakes were similar in the black tea and the Rooibos groups but with increased heme iron intakes in the black tea group. Iron status markers seemed to improve from baseline to the end of the study in both of the study groups. One possible reason is the antihelminthic treatment the participants received when the study commenced. 3ablack tea 3aCamellia sinensis 3aplant extracts 3adietary minerals 3aheme iron 3anutritional intervention 3aelementary students 3airon deficiency anemia 3arandomized clinical trials 3afood intake 3aserving size 3aanthelmintics 3anutrient availability 3ahemoglobin 3ahematocrit 3aferritin 3atransferrin 3anutritional status 3arural areas 3aBlacks 3aSouth Africa1 aKruger, H.S.1 aJerling, J.C.1 aOosthuizen, W.0 tNutrition research.g2005 Nov., v. 25, no. 11 p.983-994x0271-53177nnas  aDNAL  a20060210b20060302c00000000  aINDdPNNe2006/02/10  aOther US 7aarticle03336naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002700145245010600172300001800278520210300296650001802399650002102417650002502438650001202463650001802475650002202493650001102515650003202526650002302558653002202581653002602603653002202629653002302651700002602674773009802700852000902798856008502807930003302892946001302925655001202938IND4443735720221123015911.0101015e201011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444373572DNAL7 a10.1007/s10021-010-9372-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEssington, Timothy E. 10aQuantifying Hypoxia Impacts on an Estuarine Demersal Community Using a Hierarchical Ensemble Approach  ap. 1035-1048.  aIn coastal marine ecosystems, hypoxia and anoxia are emerging as growing threats whose ecological impacts are difficult to ascertain because of the frequent lack of adequate references for comparison. We applied conventional and hierarchical ensemble analyses to evaluate the weight of evidence in support of hypoxia impacts on local densities of individual and groups of demersal fish and invertebrate species in Hood Canal, WA, which is subject to seasonal hypoxia in its southern reaches. Central to our approach was a sample design and analysis scheme that was designed specifically to consider multiple alternative hypotheses regarding factors that dictate local species' densities. We anticipated persistent effects of hypoxia (felt even when seasonal hypoxia was absent) on species densities would be most pronounced for sessile species, but that immediate effects (felt only when seasonal hypoxia was present) would dominate for mobile species. Conventional analysis provided strong evidence that densities of sessile species were persistently reduced in the hypoxic-impacted site, but did not indicate widespread immediate density responses during hypoxic events among mobile species. The absence of strong weights of evidence for hypoxia effects was partly a consequence of alternative hypotheses that better explained spatial-temporal variation in species' densities. The hierarchical ensemble analysis improved the precision of species-specific effect sizes, and also allowed us to make inferences about the response of aggregated groups of species. The estimated mean density reductions during hypoxic events (dissolved oxygen ~2 mg/l) ranged from 73 to 98% among mobile invertebrates, benthic, and benthopelagic fishes. The large reduction in benthic and benthopelagic species suggests substantial effects of hypoxia in Hood Canal even at oxygen levels that were marginally hypoxic. Understanding the full ecological consequence of hypoxia will require a greater knowledge on the spatial extent of distributional shifts and their effects on competitive and predator-prey interactions. 3ademersal fish 3adissolved oxygen 3aenvironmental impact 3ahypoxia 3ainvertebrates 3amarine ecosystems 3aoxygen 3apredator-prey relationships 3aweight-of-evidence 0aestuarine ecology 0ahierarchical modeling 0aimpact assessment 0ademersal community1 aPaulsen, Caroline E. 0 tEcosystems.g2010 Nov., v. 13, no. 7 p.1035-1048dNew York : Springer-Verlagx1432-98407nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10021-010-9372-z3Available from publisher's Web site  a20101015b20101108c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02438naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002900092040001800121100002000139245010000159300001600259520123200275650002201507650001501529650002301544650001101567650001101578650001901589650003001608650001601638650002501654650002001679650001601699650001101715650001301726650001501739650002901754651001801783700001801801700002201819700001601841773009601857856004201953852000901995655001202004IND4529748220221123015905.0141110e200303  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND452974822DNAL7 a10.13031/2013.129422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFleisher, D.

Norland) under elevated atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration. Adaptations included adjustment of input files to account for cultural differences between the field and controlled environments, calibration of genetic coefficients, and adjustment of crop parameters including radiation use efficiency. Source code modifications were also performed to account for the absorption of light reflected from the surface below the crop canopy, an increased leaf senescence rate, a carbon (mass) balance to the model, and to modify the response of crop growth rate to elevated atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration. Adaptations were primarily based on growth and phenological data obtained from growth chamber experiments at Rutgers University (New Brunswick, N.J.) and from the modeling literature. ModifiedâSUBSTOR predictions were compared with data from Kennedy Space Centerâs Biomass Production Chamber for verification. Results show that, with further development, modifiedâSUBSTOR will be a useful tool for analysis and optimization of potato growth in controlled environments. 3aSolanum tuberosum 3aabsorption 3abiomass production 3acanopy 3acarbon 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbon dioxide enrichment 3acrop models 3acultural differences 3agrowth chambers 3ahydroponics 3aleaves 3apotatoes 3aprediction 3aradiation use efficiency 3aNew Brunswick1 aCavazzoni, J.1 aGiacomelli, G.

There are few studies on bat taxonomic groups for this biome. Herein we present a bat survey employing mist nets in the protected area of a private natural heritage reserve Reserva Particular do Patrimônio Natural Pousada das Araras, located in the west-central Brazil. We investigate the hypothesis that the Cerrado habitat complexity plays a role on the different structuring forces in bat ecological communities. Bats represent a diversity of trophic levels, and they occupy a wide range of available Cerrado habitats and microhabitats. The patterns and processes we discuss represent the factors influencing coexisting species of bats in different habitats and their implications for conservation. We captured 758 individuals of 25 species belonging to four families. Phyllostomidae was the dominant family, represented by 20 species (80%). The average recapture rate was 6.2%, and the species with most proportional recapture was A. caudifer. Greater species richness was observed among bats with predominantly insectivore habits, followed by frugivores. Glossophaga soricina was a dominant species, with about 30% of the captures. There was seasonal variation relating to the number of bats captured, with greater bat frequency occurring during the wet season, although some species occurred at higher rates during the dry season, such as C. perspicillata and S. lilium. Sanguivore bats were abundant, reflecting the availability of shelters and food supply (livestock) in the surrounding area. Compared to other surveyed areas, Pousada das Araras may be considered of high species diversity, supplanting the majority of known Cerrado studied areas. Apparently Cerrado favours the occurrence of insectivore species, with emphasis on the foliage-gleaning insectivores belong to the subfamily Phyllostominae. This study indicates that apparently the conservation of the Cerrado savanna fragments can support a considerable diversity of bat species. 3adry season 3ainsectivores 3amicrohabitats 3ahabitat conservation 3aLilium 3afood availability 3alivestock 3asavannas 3aecosystems 3aseasonal variation 3aPhyllostomidae 3aspecies diversity 3awet season 3acerrado 3aBrazil 0afood supply1 aAlho, Cleber J.

The amounts of both the substrates were fixed to 0.1 mmol and an immobilized enzyme, Lipozyme, was used as catalyst. The experiment was performed following a statistic central composite design with five variables. The enzyme/lipid ratio was varied between 0.3-0.9 of the substrate weight and the enzyme was equilibrated to different water activities varying from 0.11 to 0.44. A temperature range of 50-80°C was investigated and the reaction time lasted up to 40 min. A solvent, isooctane, constituted 0-30% of the substrate weight. The first experimental series was performed in small closed test tubes. In the second series the caps of the test tubes were off to evaporate the methanol produced during the reaction. The highest initial reaction rate was 9.6 gwax esters/genzyme · h. It appeared when: the enzyme/lipid ratio was low, 0.3, the temperature was high, 80°C; no isooctane was present; and the water activity was below 0.11. The initial reaction rate was independent of the caps on the test tubes. With the large amount of enzyme the yield of wax esters was above 70% after 10 min in both experimental series. In the reaction with caps, the reaction reached equilibrium at 83% after 20 min at 80°C. However, without caps the continuous evaporation of methanol increased the equilibrium constantly, and after 40 min at 80°C a yield of 90% was reached. 3aevaporation 3afatty acids 3aimmobilized enzymes 3amethanol 3arapeseed 3atemperature 3awater activity 3awax esters1 aWang, Daobin1 aHärröd, Magnus0 tjournal of the American Oil Chemists' Society.g1999 Feb., v. 76, no. 2 p.183-187dSpringer-Verlagw36179x0003-021X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11746-999-0216-y 7aarticle02270naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002100110245013300131300001600264520099700280650002601277650001001303650000901313650002501322650002201347650002301369650001701392650001001409650002001419650002301439650001301462650001401475650000901489650001601498650002801514700001901542700002001561700001901581773007601600852000901676856010501685939003301790946001301823655001201836IND4479218720221123015853.0140328e200203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447921872DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTsuyuki, Yoshiko10aEffect of maternal diet rich in docosahexaenoic acid on intrauterine fetal growth retardation in spontaneously hypertensive rats  ap. 355-364.  aThe aim of this study was to determine the effect of maternal diet rich in docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) on intrauterine fetal growth retardation in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). SHRs were fed purified diet containing either a safflower/soybeans oil mixture or a DHA-enriched oil during pregnancy. Systolic blood pressure was measured before and during pregnancy. The weights of the fetal body, organs and placenta were measured at day 20 of gestation in SHRs and were compared with those in normotensive Wistar Kyoto (WKY) control strain. In SHRs, the dietary DHA significantly decreased the systolic blood pressure by 10-15% after day 18 of gestation. The weights of fetal body, brain, and liver in the SHRs without DHA were significantly lower than those in the WKY rats. This growth retardation was prevented by the dietary DHA. The results demonstrated that maternal dietary DHA decreased the blood pressure during late gestation and prevented the fetal growth retardation in SHRs. 3aanimal disease models 3abrain 3adiet 3adocosahexaenoic acid 3afetal development 3agrowth retardation 3ahypertension 3aliver 3amaternal effect 3amaternal nutrition 3aplacenta 3apregnancy 3arats 3asoybean oil 3asystolic blood pressure1 aNakai, Akihito1 aKoshino, Tatsuo1 aAraki, Tsutomu0 tNutrition research.g2002 Mar., v. 22, no. 3 p.355-364x0271-53177nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.nrjournal.com/issues?issue_key=S0271-5317(00)X0082-63Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b00000000c20140328  aOther US 7aarticle02496naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127072001700144100001500161245013100176300001600307500001500323520103300338650001601371650001801387650003001405650003001435650001101465650001201476650002501488650002301513650001001536650002001546650001701566650001001583650002301593650002201616650000701638650001701645650001701662650002001679653002601699653002101725653002001746700001601766700001501782773007701797852000901874930003301883945002501916946001301941655001201954IND4377158820221122061138.0060111e200510  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437715882DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

The pomace contains high levels of insoluble fiber fractions (IFFs) (50.8-56.3 g per 100 g of pomace, dry matter) that have desirable characteristics and physicochemical properties. In this study, the influence of IFFs derived from the pomace was investigated on the intestinal enzymes, fecal bacterial enzymes, and some biochemical parameters in the hamster. Our results showed that feeding carambola and carrot IFFs at 5% of the diet to hamsters significantly (P < .05) reduced cecal pH (6.50-6.64), cecal and fecal ammonia levels (by 18.8%-21.2% and 50.0%-53.7%, respectively), and the activities of β-D-glucosidase (by 12.1%-20.1%), β-D-glucuronidase (by 54.8%-78.2%), mucinase (by 12.6%-20.2%), and urease (by 60.3%-63.7%) in feces. These results suggest that IFFs in carambola and carrot might exert favorable effects on improving intestinal functions and health and could be exploited as functional ingredients in fiber-rich food products. 3afood intake 3adietary fiber 3aintestinal microorganisms 3agastrointestinal motility 3apomace 3acarrots 3aMesocricetus auratus 3aexperimental diets 3acecum 3ainsoluble fiber 3ahealth foods 3afeces 3aAverrhoa carambola 3adigestive enzymes 3apH 3acarrot juice 3afruit juices 3aenzyme activity 0abiochemical compounds 0aintestine health 0agolden hamsters1 aChien, P.J.1 aChen, C.H.0 tNutrition research.g2005 Oct., v. 25, no. 10 p.947-957x0271-53177nnas  aDNAL  a20060127b20060202c00000000  aINDdPNNe2006/01/27  aOther US 7aarticle01441naa a2200301 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100002000115245004600135300001400181300002800195520065000223650001900873650001100892650002000903650001800923653001400941653001600955700002100971773007200992852000901064939003301073945000801106946001301114655001201127991610527430742620221122060954.0870423e198611  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI870007602DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAnandaraman, S.10aStability of encapsulated orange peel oil  ap. 88-93.  ap. 88-93. ill., charts.  aA study assessed the stability of encapsulated orange peel oil using maltodextrins of various dextrose equivalents.

The subjects were composed of 44 women with low-grade cervical neoplasia (cervical intraepithelial neoplasm I), 70 women with high-grade cervical neoplasia (cervical intraepithelial neoplasm II, III, and carcinoma in situ), and 95 women who served as controls. The low folate status in these women showed a strong association with cervical dysplasia. Serum folate was markedly lower in both low-grade (P < .01) and high-grade cervical neoplasia cases (P < .01) compared with the control women. Using logistic regression, the odds ratio for low-grade cervical neoplasia with low serum folate level (< 19.82 nmol/L) was 6.13, whereas that of the high-grade group with the same folate level was 5.57. The findings support the contention that folate deficiency of women in this study had an increased risk of cervical change. 3aPapillomaviridae 3awomen 3auterine cervical neoplasms 3arisk factors 3avitamin deficiencies 3afolic acid 3ahomocysteine 3ablood serum 3anutritional status 3anutrition assessment 3aThailand1 aSaengkar, P.1 aCheeramakara, C.1 aThanomsak, W.1 aBenjachai, W.1 aLaisupasin, P.1 aBuchachart, K.1 aSongmuaeng, K.1 aBoontaveeyuwat, N.0 tNutrition research.g2005 July, v. 25, no. 7 p.641-654x0271-53177nnas  aDNAL  a20070831b20070902c00000000  aINDdPNNe2005/11/03  aOther US 7aarticle03062naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100002000171245009400191300001600285520130400301650001601605650000801621650001501629650001501644650001101659650002401670650001001694650001601704650001201720650002301732650002001755650001501775650002601790650002601816650005101842650003501893650003501928650001501963650001501978650001701993650002402010650003602034650002102070653002302091700001902114700002502133700002102158700002002179700001802199773011002217852000902327856009202336930003302428946001102461655001202472IND4440272820221122050224.0100723e201008  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444027282DNAL7 a204873842pmid7 a10.1111/j.1365-313X.2010.04249.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCastells, Enric10adet1-1-induced UV-C hyposensitivity through UVR3 and PHR1 photolyase gene over-expression  ap. 392-404.  aObligate photoautotrophs such as plants must capture energy from sunlight and are therefore exposed to the damaging collateral effects of ultraviolet (UV) irradiation, especially on DNA. Here we investigated the interconnection between light signaling and DNA repair, two concomitant pathways during photomorphogenesis, the developmental transition associated with the first light exposure. It is shown that combination of an enhanced sunscreen effect and photoreactivation confers a greater level of tolerance to damaging UV-C doses in the constitutive photomorphogenic de-etiolated1-1 (det1--1) Arabidopsis mutant. In darkness, expression of the PHR1 and UVR3 photolyase genes, responsible for photoreactivation, is maintained at a basal level through the positive action of HY5 and HYH photomorphogenesis-promoting transcription factors and the repressive effects of DET1 and COP1. Upon light exposure, HY5 and HYH activate PHR1 gene expression while the constitutively expressed nuclear-localized DET1 protein exerts a strong inhibitory effect. Altogether, the data presented indicate a dual role for DET1 in controlling expression of light-responsive and DNA repair genes, and describe more precisely the contribution of photomorphogenic regulators in the control of light-dependent DNA repair. 3aArabidopsis 3aDNA 3aDNA repair 3aautotrophs 3aenergy 3agene overexpression 3agenes 3airradiation 3amutants 3aphotomorphogenesis 3asolar radiation 3asunscreens 3atranscription factors 3aultraviolet radiation 2aArabidopsisxenzymologyxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aArabidopsis Proteinsxgenetics 2aCarbon-Carbon Lyasesxgenetics 2aDNA Damage 2aDNA Repair 2aGenes, Plant 2aSignal Transduction 2aTranscription Factorsxgenetics 2aUltraviolet Rays 0aphotomorphogenesis1 aMolinier, Jean1 aDrevensek, Stephanie1 aGenschik, Pascal1 aBarneche, Fredy1 aBowler, Chris0 tPlant journal.g2010 Aug., v. 63, no. 3 p.392-404dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0960-74127nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-313X.2010.04249.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20100723b20100807c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03067naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127072001700144100001400161245017500175300001600350520170600366650002902072650002002101650003002121650002402151650001502175650001702190650002602207650001502233650002302248650003502271650002602306650001602332650001402348650002002362700001102382700001602393700001702409700001502426773007602441852000902517930003302526945002502559946001302584655001202597IND4375332720221122050106.0051020e200507  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437533272DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aOhtsu, H.10aCongulated linoleic acid decreases cellular proliferation and inhibits nuclear factor-kappaB and activator protein 1 activation in PC3 cancerous prostate epithelial cells  ap. 655-662.  aThe precise etiologic factors that initiate and enhance the progression of prostate cancer remains unknown, but diet and lifestyle factors have come forth as significant contributing factors. Conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) is a family of fatty acid isomers found in ruminant food products that appear to have chemopreventive properties in animal models of cancer and antiproliferative effects in several types of cancer cells. Dysregulation and constitutive activation of nuclear factor-kappaB (NFkappaB) and activator protein 1 (AP1) is found in malignant prostate cells, and dietary components that target these transcription factors may prove to be effective chemopreventive agents. The purpose of this study was to examine the antiproliferative effects of CLA on PC3 cancerous prostate epithelial cells and test the ability of CLA to modulate transcription factors NFkappaB and AP1. We found that a mixture of CLA isomers potently inhibited cellular proliferation of androgen-independent PC3 prostate carcinoma cells in a dose-dependent manner. Electromobility shift assays also revealed that CLA inhibited constitutive activation of NFkappaB and AP1 transcription factors in PC3 cells. Mobility shift assays demonstrated that CLA also induced activation peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs). However, time course studies revealed that PPAR activation occurred after inhibitory effects on NFkappaB and AP1, suggesting that inhibition of NFkappaB and AP1 did not depend on PPAR activation. The ability of CLA to attenuate inflammatory processes and cellular proliferation by the inhibition of these transcription factors could be the key in their ability to limit cancer development. 3aconjugated linoleic acid 3achemoprevention 3aanticarcinogenic activity 3aprostatic neoplasms 3acell lines 3acell culture 3anutrient availability 3acell cycle 3acell proliferation 3anutrition-genotype interaction 3atranscription factors 3aperoxisomes 3aviability 3aredox reactions1 aHo, E.1 aHuang, Y.S.1 aChuang, L.T.1 aBray, T.M.0 tNutrition research.g2005 July, v. 25, no. 7 p.655-662x0271-53177nnas  aDNAL  a20070831b20070902c00000000  aINDdPNNe2005/11/03  aOther US 7aarticle02443naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127072001700144100001300161245011000174300001600284520117700300650004201477650001501519650001801534650002501552650001801577650000901595650003001604650001001634650002001644650002301664650002301687650002101710650002201731650001401753700002301767700001501790700002401805773007601829852000901905930003301914945002501947946001301972655001201985IND4375321020221122050314.0051019e200506  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437532102DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aGoni, I.10aArtichoke (Cynara scolymus L) modifies bacterial enzymatic activities and antioxidant status in rat cecum  ap. 607-615.  aArtichoke (Cynara scolymus L) contains indigestible organic matter that reaches the colon and is substrate for intestinal microbiota. The capacity of artichoke to modify metabolic activities of colonic bacterial enzymes (azoreductase, β-glucuronidase, β-glucosidase, nitroreductase, and nitrate reductase) and antioxidant status were studied in the cecal content of Wistar rats. Rats were fed a fiber-free diet supplemented with cellulose (control diet) or artichoke, for 3 weeks. The artichoke diet increased the weight of the cecum content and caused hypertrophy of the cecum wall. Artichoke modified bacterial enzyme activities (increased β-glucuronidase, β-glucosidase, and nitroreductase and reduced nitrate reductase and azoreductase activities), which enhances the capacity of microbial enzymes to metabolize glycosides and nitrocompounds. The antioxidant status in cecal contents was more favorable in the artichoke group. Free-radical scavenging capacity and reducing power were significantly higher in the group fed with artichoke than in the control group. These findings suggest that the indigestible fraction of artichoke may affect the intestinal health. 3aCynara cardunculus subsp. cardunculus 3aartichokes 3adietary fiber 3aantioxidant activity 3afree radicals 3arats 3aintestinal microorganisms 3acecum 3aenzyme activity 3amicrobial activity 3abeta-glucuronidase 3abeta-glucosidase 3anitrite reductase 3acellulose1 aJimenez-Escrig, A.1 aGudiel, M.1 aSaura-Calixto, F.D.0 tNutrition research.g2005 June, v. 25, no. 6 p.607-615x0271-53177nnas  aDNAL  a20080520b20080606c00000000  aINDdPNNe2005/11/04  aOther US 7aarticle02479naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127072001700144100001700161245014400178300001600322520126300338650000901601650001801610650002101628650002701649650002501676650001501701650001801716650001401734650002701748650002801775650002001803650001101823700001701834700002001851700001701871773007701888852000901965930003301974945002502007946001302032655001202045IND4376107120221122050113.0051117e200509  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437610712DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

The objective of this study was to elucidate the effect of prebiotic carbohydrates of different chain lengths on azoxymethane-induced aberrant crypt foci in Fisher 344 male rats. After an acclimatization period of 1 week, 70 male weanling rats were divided into 7 groups and fed AIN-93G (Control) and 6 experimental diets that contained control + (maltodextrin; Raftiline HP, Raftiline ST, Raftilose P95, Raftilose Synergy1, and Mix; ORAFTI, Tienen, Belgium). All the rats received 16 mg/kg body weight of azoxymethane dissolved in saline subcutaneous at 7 and 8 weeks of age. The rats continued to receive the assigned diets until killed by carbon dioxide asphyxiation at 17 weeks of age. There was a significant (P < .05) increase in cecal weight and a decrease in cecal pH in rats fed prebiotic carbohydrates. The highest reduction of colonic aberrant crypt foci, both in total number as well as crypt, multiplicity was seen in the group fed Mix (63.9%). Consumption of diets containing Raftilose Synergy1, Raftiline ST, and Raftiline HP showed a reduction of total colonic crypts by 52.2%, 29.6%, and 46.3%, respectively, as compared with the control diet. 3arats 3aanimal models 3aoxidative stress 3achromosome aberrations 3acolorectal neoplasms 3aprebiotics 3adietary fiber 3aweanlings 3afructooligosaccharides 3ashort chain fatty acids 3ainsoluble fiber 3ainulin1 aWalker, L.T.1 aShackelford, L.1 aChawan, C.B.0 tNutrition research.g2005 Sept., v. 25, no. 9 p.859-868x0271-53177nnas  aDNAL  a20051128b20051202c00000000  aINDdPNNe2005/11/28  aOther US 7aarticle02681naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002500092040001800117100001700135245008200152300001800234500002300252500001500275520147700290650002001767650001001787650002001797650002001817650002301837650002101860650001201881650001601893650003601909650002001945650001101965651001201976653001001988653001101998773009702009852000902106856007502115930003302190945001302223946001102236655001202247IND2331674520221122050136.0030328e200208  onc|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233167452DNAL7 a10.1139/x02-0662doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNuorteva, H.10aIncreased boron concentrations of Scots pine foliage induced by green pruning  ap. 1434-1440.  aSummary in French.  a2019-12-04  aThe responses of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) foliar boron (B) concentrations to artificial defoliation by green pruning were studied by examining sample trees for 3 years after the treatments. In winter, concentrations of boron in foliage were determined individually from needles on the lateral top shoots of 168 sample trees (at the beginning 2-8 m, at the end 4-10 m tall). To prevent the pruning residues from affecting the nutrition of the sample trees, all pruned branches were transported away from the research area. Before pruning, there were no differences in foliar B among the pruning classes. Reduction of the living crown by pruning (LCRP, % of the initial crown ratio) 50% or more increased the concentrations of foliar B drastically for 3 years. The increase was greatest in the largest trees with the highest LCRP (about 70%), where the mean concentrations of foliar B one year after pruning were nearly 180% higher than in the unpruned trees. Pruning of the dead branch whorls or only the few lowest living whorls did not affect the boron nutrition of the trees. In the current study, the ability of rapid and sufficiently large defoliation to increase B concentrations for several years in the Scots pine foliage was confirmed experimentally; earlier suggestions have been based on analyses made after defoliation. The potential suitability of green pruning is discussed as a method for improving the boron status of trees in boron-deficient areas. 3aplant nutrition 3aboron 3anutrient uptake 3aconifer needles 3aseasonal variation 3aPinus sylvestris 3apruning 3adefoliation 3achemical constituents of plants 3amineral content 3ashoots 3aFinland 0acrown 0aleaves0 tCanadian journal of forest research =.g2002 Aug., v. 32, no. 8 p.1434-1440x0045-50677nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/x02-0663Available from publisher's Web site  a20030602b20030603c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle02992naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100001600154245005600170300001600226500026900242520158000511650001902091650002802110650001602138650001502154650002602169650001602195650001202211650002002223650001502243650001602258650002002274650001802294700001402312700001502326700001602341700001602357773014502373856005502518852000902573655001202582IND60543832520221122050312.0160901e20151223xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054383252DNAL7 a10.17660/ActaHortic.2015.1107.362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSalazar, R.10aTomato yield prediction in a semi-closed greenhouse  ap. 263-270.  aPaper presented at the XXIX International Horticultural Congress on Horticulture: Sustaining Lives, Livelihoods and Landscapes (IHC2014): International Symposium on Innovation and new Technologies in Protected Cropping: held August 17-22, 2014, Brisbane, Australia  aTomato yields often vary from week to week, so the ability to accurately predict them would give producers a competitive advantage. As a result there has been interest from growers and researchers about tomato yield prediction. The purpose of this study is to predict tomato yield in a semi-closed and reference experimental greenhouses, located at Humboldt University of Berlin. At this location a range of physiological as well as environmental variables have been automatically monitored. A Dynamic Artificial Neural Network (DANN) was implemented to predict yields in both greenhouses for comparison purposes. The input data were CO2 fixation, transpiration, and solar radiation, as well as past yield. The output is the yield for the next week. Different networks were built and evaluated to suggest a certain network structure that provides optimal results for this particular case. A sensitivity analysis was conducted to estimate the relative importance of the different inputs to model predictions. The most important variable for yield prediction was CO2 fixation, and the least important was transpiration. Given the high costs of the phytomonitoring systems, our interest was to prove that yield can be predicted using only external conditions and yield with delays, thus using only solar radiation as the input variable gave a correlation coefficient of R=0.9165 for training validation and testing, R=0.9784 for simulation, the absolute error in both cases was very small. These results show the DANN is as a powerful tool for prediction with few data patterns. 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbon dioxide fixation 3acorrelation 3acrop yield 3aenvironmental factors 3agreenhouses 3agrowers 3aneural networks 3aprediction 3aresearchers 3asolar radiation 3atranspiration1 aLopez, I.1 aRojano, A.1 aSchmidt, U.1 aDannehl, D.0 tActa horticulturae.g2015 Dec. 23, , no. 1107 p.263-270dInternational Society for Horticultural Science.wJournal:jnl46289x0567-75727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.17660/ActaHortic.2015.1107.36  aDNAL 7aarticle02333naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002900092040001800121100001500139245011200154300001600266520138000282650002601662650002201688650002101710650002101731650002101752700001701773773008201790852000901872856007901881930003301960945001301993946001302006655001202019IND2040990520221122040801.0940722e199404  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204099052DNAL7 a10.1093/ee/23.2.3962doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJoseph, G.10aAcceptability and suitability of Douglas-fir as a secondary host for gypsy moth (Lepidoptera: Lymantriidae)  ap. 396-405.  aGiven free choice, first instar gypsy moth, Lymantria dispar (L.), larvae selected new flush Douglas-fir, Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco, foliage over 1-yr-old fir needles, fir bud scales, or young expanding white alder, Alnus rhombifolia Nutt., leaves. Although new fir foliage was the most acceptable, it was not the most suitable for first or fourth instars. Fourth instars fed new fir foliage consumed more but did not grow any better than larvae fed 1-yr-old needles or alder. This was the result of a decreased efficiency of converting digested food to growth. Switching II, III, or IV instars from white alder to Douglas-fir reduced pupal weights compared with larvae fed white alder alone but it did not affect development rate. Switching to Douglas-fir increased instar duration and decreased relative weight gain for all instar switches, but this lasted only for the instar switched. As a secondary host for gypsy moth, Douglas-fir differs from northeastern pines. First instars ingest new fir foliage but not pine foliage because of its toughness. Larvae switched from a preferred host to fir do not perform as well as larvae remaining on the preferred host, whereas larvae switched to pine outperform those remaining on the preferred host. In Northwest forests, Douglas-fir could possibly maintain gypsy moth populations without the presence of other hosts. 3aPseudotsuga menziesii 3aAlnus rhombifolia 3aLymantria dispar 3afeeding behavior 3ahost preferences1 aKelsey, R.G.0 tEnvironmental entomology.g1994 Apr., v. 23, no. 2 p.396-405x0046-225X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ee/23.2.3963Available from publisher's Web site  a19940802b19940811c00000000  aINDdTLX  aOther US 7aarticle02264naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127072001700144072001700161100001300178245010300191300001600294500001500310520113300325650002001458650001601478650001601494650001301510650001901523650002201542650001101564650002301575650001701598650002201615653000901637700001401646700001401660773007601674852000901750930003301759945002501792946001301817655001201830IND4363853720221122032047.0040812e200407  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436385372DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

A total of 143 pregnant women in their first trimester participated in the study. Morning sickness tended to make the subjects eliminate food groups, especially the meat and dairy groups. Consequently, the subjects who experienced morning sickness consumed less diverse diets with less energy, protein, and all micronutrients examined. Maternal weight gain during the first trimester tended to decrease gradually with increasing severity of morning sickness. Birth weights of infants born to subjects with even mild symptoms of morning sickness were significantly lower than those from the women without morning sickness. Birth weight and chest circumference seemed to be influenced by morning sickness also. In conclusion, morning sickness in pregnant women result in poor dietary diversity and reduced intakes of energy, protein, and micronutrients and, consequently, adversely affect infant outcome as well as maternal weight gain during early pregnancy. 3anutrient intake 3afood intake 3aweight gain 3avomiting 3apregnant women 3afetal development 3anausea 3amaternal nutrition 3afood choices 3apregnancy outcome 0adiet1 aLee, J.A.1 aLim, H.S.0 tNutrition research.g2004 July, v. 24, no. 7 p.531-540x0271-53177nnas  aDNAL  a20050408b20050501c00000000  aINDdPNNe2005/04/08  aOther US 7aarticle01806naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127072001700144100001700161245008000178300001600258520045400274650001600728650000800744650001100752650001100763650001400774650002000788650002200808650002900830650002300859650002000882650002500902650002500927650001800952650001000970650002200980650002101002653001601023653002501039700001501064700001801079700001701097700001901114773007501133852000901208930003301217945002501250946001301275655001201288IND4363391820221122031852.0040714e200405  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436339182DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Diabetic status in rats was found to be ameliorated about 25% in rats fed with quercetin. 3aethnobotany 3atea 3aapples 3aonions 3aquercetin 3aglycemic effect 3adiabetes mellitus 3anutritional intervention 3aexperimental diets 3anutrient intake 3amedicinal properties 3aantioxidant activity 3ablood glucose 3aurine 3aglucose tolerance 3aglycemic control 0aurine sugar 0afatsting blood sugar1 aRashmi, R.1 aRajan, M.G.R.1 aSambaiah, K.1 aSalimath, P.V.0 tNutrition research.g2004 May, v. 24, no. 5 p.373-381x0271-53177nnas  aDNAL  a20050407b20050501c00000000  aINDdPNNe2005/04/07  aOther US 7aarticle02850naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100002500188245005300213300001300266506007600279520159100355592002801946506003701974650002502011650001702036650002502053650001802078650002002096650001002116650001402126650000902140650002902149650002602178700001702204700002202221773010702243856008102350852000902431655001202440IND60119383420221207101915.0141214e200912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011938342DNAL7 a10.1186/gb-2009-10-12-2482doi7 aPMC28129402pmcid7 a200675902pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 avan der Graaff, Eric14aThe WUS homeobox-containing (WOX) protein family  ap. 2129.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe WOX genes form a plant-specific subclade of the eukaryotic homeobox transcription factor superfamily, which is characterized by the presence of a conserved DNA-binding homeodomain. The analysis of WOX gene expression and function shows that WOX family members fulfill specialized functions in key developmental processes in plants, such as embryonic patterning, stem-cell maintenance and organ formation. These functions can be related to either promotion of cell division activity and/or prevention of premature cell differentiation. The phylogenetic tree of the plant WOX proteins can be divided into three clades, termed the WUS, intermediate and ancient clade. WOX proteins of the WUS clade appear to some extent able to functionally complement other members. The specific function of individual WOX-family proteins is most probably determined by their spatiotemporal expression pattern and probably also by their interaction with other proteins, which may repress their transcriptional activity. The prototypic WOX-family member WUS has recently been shown to act as a bifunctional transcription factor, functioning as repressor in stem-cell regulation and as activator in floral patterning. Past research has mainly focused on part of the WOX protein family in some model flowering plants, such as Arabidopsis thaliana (thale cress) or Oryza sativa (rice). Future research, including so-far neglected clades and non-flowering plants, is expected to reveal how these master switches of plant differentiation and embryonic patterning evolved and how they fulfill their function.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aOryza sativa 3acell differentiation 3acell division 3agene expression 3agenes 3aphylogeny 3arice 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranscription factors1 aLaux, Thomas1 aRensing, Stefan A0 tGenome biology.g2009 Dec., v. 10, no. 12 p.2129-2129dSpringer-VerlagwJournal:19127x1474-760X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/gb-2009-10-12-2483Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02367naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100003200147245016200179300001600341520115300357592002801510650001001538650001401548650001001562650001201572650001401584650001201598650001101610650001001621650001501631650001101646651001101657700002701668700003801695700003301733773012501766856008101891852000901972655001201981IND60522638120221121021917.0160603e201607  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052263812DNAL7 a10.1007/s10493-016-0045-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSantos, Emili Bortolon dos,10aMites (Acari: Trombidiformes) parasitizing mosquitoes (Diptera: Culicidae) in an Atlantic Forest area in southern Brazil with a new mite genus country record  ap. 323-333.  aIn this study, a total of 4146 culicids collected in an Atlantic Forest area in Paraná state, southern Brazil were examined for the presence of mites. Forty larval Parasitengone mites (Arrenurus spp., Arrenuridae; Durenia spp., Trombellidae; Microtrombidium spp., Microtrombidiidae) parasitized 25 specimens of mosquitoes, with the intensity varying from one to nine mites attached. Most mites were found on Aedes serratus/nubilus, Culex vomerifer, Cx. pedroi and Cx. sacchettae. The overall percentage of parasitized mosquitoes was 0.6 %. The highest intensity of mites encountered was in an individual of Cx. pedroi with nine attached mites. Regarding the attachment site, most mite specimens were attached to the abdomen (n = 25), whereas 15 were located on the thorax. Specimens of Arrenurus spp. were only found on the abdomen of mosquitoes, and the same was observed for Microtrombidium spp., while Durenia spp. attached to both the thorax (n = 15) and abdomen (n = 4). This is the first record for the genus Durenia in Brazil. Additionally, some species of mosquitoes were, for the first time, reported as being parasitized by mites.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAedes 3aArrenurus 3aCulex 3aabdomen 3aacarology 3aforests 3alarvae 3amites 3aparasitism 3athorax 3aBrazil1 aFavretto, Mario Arthur1 ados Santos Costa, Samuel Geremias1 aNavarro-Silva, Mario Antonio0 tExperimental & applied acarology.g2016 July, v. 69, no. 3 p.323-333dSpringer International Publishingx0168-81627nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10493-016-0045-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04024naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004600111040001800157100002200175245013700197300001600334520226700350592002802617650001002645650001902655650002102674650001902695650001302714650001502727650002002742650002202762650001302784650002302797650001902820650001602839650001202855650001302867650001202880650001602892650004302908650003202951650001102983650003102994650000903025650003503034650003503069650001903104650002803123650002203151650001703173700002003190700001603210700002003226773008703246856009203333852000903425655001203434IND4478096420221118125332.0141111e201202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447809642DNAL7 a219824322pmid7 a10.1016/j.theriogenology.2011.08.0352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKumarēcan̲, A.,14aThe effect of oviductal fluid on protein tyrosine phosphorylation in cryopreserved boar spermatozoa differs with the freezing method  ap. 588-599.  aSperm capacitation takes place in the oviduct and protein tyrosine phosphorylation of sperm proteins is a crucial step in capacitation and acquisition of fertilizing potential. Cryopreserved spermatozoa show altered expression of protein tyrosine phosphorylation in the oviduct. The present study compared two freezing methods (conventional-conventional freezing (CF) and simplified-simplified freezing (SF) methods) for their effect on the ability of boar spermatozoa to undergo protein tyrosine phosphorylation in response to oviductal fluid (ODF). Cryopreserved boar-spermatozoa were incubated with pre- and post-ovulatory ODF for 6 h at 38 °C under 5% CO₂. Aliquots of sperm samples were taken at hourly intervals and analyzed for kinematics and protein tyrosine phosphorylation. Global protein tyrosine phosphorylation in spermatozoa was measured using flow cytometry and different patterns of phosphorylation were assessed using confocal microscopy. Immediately after thawing, no significant difference was observed in post-thaw sperm motility, velocity and global tyrosine phosphorylation between the two methods of freezing although the freezing method significantly (P < 0.05) influenced the effect of oviductal fluid on these parameters during incubation. While spermatozoa frozen by the CF method showed a significantly higher (P < 0.001) proportion of phosphorylation in response to preovulatory ODF during incubation, spermatozoa frozen by the SF method did not elicit such significant response as there was no significant difference in the proportion of tyrosine phosphorylated spermatozoa between treatments at any given time during incubation. If the CF method was used, the proportion of spermatozoa displaying either tail or full sperm phosphorylation increased in response to both preovulatory (EODF) and postovulatory oviductal fluid. However, if the SF method was used, a significant increase in these patterns was noticed only in the EODF treated group. The present study demonstrates that preovulatory isthmic ODF induce tyrosine phosphorylation in a higher proportion of boar spermatozoa compared to the post-ovulatory fluid and that the method of freezing significantly influences the response of post-thaw spermatozoa to porcine ODF.  aPublisher supplied data 3aboars 3acarbon dioxide 3acryopreservation 3aflow cytometry 3afreezing 3akinematics 3aphosphorylation 3aprotein synthesis 3aproteins 3asperm capacitation 3asperm motility 3aspermatozoa 3athawing 3atyrosine 2aAnimals 2aBody Fluids 2aCryopreservationxmethodsxveterinary. 2aFallopian Tubesxphysiology 2aFemale 2aGene Expression Regulation 2aMale 2aSemen Preservationxveterinary 2aSperm Capacitationxphysiology 2aSperm Motility 2aSpermatozoaxenzymology 2aSwinexphysiology 2aTime Factors1 aJohannisson, A.1 aSaravia, F.1 aBergqvist, A.S.0 tTheriogenology.g2012 Feb., v. 77, no. 3 p.588-599dElsevier Inc.x0093-691X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.theriogenology.2011.08.0353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02943naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100002100166245015300187300002000340520141800360592002801778650001901806650000801825650002201833650002001855650000801875650001401883650001401897650001301911650001701924650002001941650001301961650000901974650001501983650001701998650001602015650001202031650002302043650002002066650002102086700002002107700001302127700001402140700001902154700002402173773013802197856008102335852000902416655001202425IND60119096820221121024748.0141130e201412  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011909682DNAL7 a250236532pmid7 a10.1007/s11356-014-3279-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMajeed, S.

Five concentrations ranging from 0.001 to 10 μg mL⁻¹were tested in three independent experiments. Cytotoxicity was assessed by 3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay, Rhodamine 123 and Alamar Blue. The mitochondrial changes and apoptosis of MG-exposed cells were observed by Rhodamine 123 and acridine orange/ethidium bromide (AO/EB) staining, respectively. In vitro potential DNA damaging effect of MG was tested using comet assay. Mitochondrial damage, apoptosis and DNA fragmentation increased in a concentration-dependent manner. Additionally, DNA electrophoretic mobility experiments were carried out to study the binding effect of MG to double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) of cells. DNA shift mobility experiments showed that MG is capable of strongly binding to linear dsDNA causing its degradation. Biochemical parameters such as lipid peroxidation (MDA), catalase (CAT) activity and reduced glutathione (GSH) levels were evaluated after exposure to MG. In CSK and CSG cell lines exposed to MG for 48 h, a significant increase in lipid peroxidation, which might be associated with decreased levels of reduced glutathione and catalase activity in these cell lines (p < 0.001), was observed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChanna striata 3aDNA 3aDNA fragmentation 3aacridine orange 3aair 3aapoptosis 3abreathing 3acatalase 3acytotoxicity 3aelectrophoresis 3aethidium 3afish 3afreshwater 3agenotoxicity 3aglutathione 3akidneys 3alipid peroxidation 3amalachite green 3aoxidative stress1 aNambi, K.

An investigation on effects of eight different extraction methods  ap. 1327-1335.  aThe chemical composition of brewed coffee depends on numerous factors: the beans, post-harvest processing and, finally, the extraction method. In recent decades, numerous coffee-based beverages, obtained using different extraction techniques have entered the market. This study characterizes and compares eight extraction coffee methods from a chemical-physical point of view, starting from the same raw material. Specifically, three types of Espresso, Moka, French Press, and 3 filter coffee that for the first time are reported in the scientific literature Cold Brew, V60, and Aeropress are compared.Physical measurements included the quantification of total dissolved solids, density, pH, conductivity, and viscosity. Chemical analyses identified 15 chlorogenic acids (CGAs): six caffeoylquinic acids, one p-Coumaroylquinic acid, one Feruloylquinic Acid, four Caffeoylquinic lactones, and three Dicaffeoylquinic acids. Maximum caffeine and CGA concentrations were found in Espresso coffees, while Moka and filtered coffees were three to six times less concentrated. The classic Espresso method was most efficient for caffeine and CGA recovery, with a yield almost double that of other methods. Per-cup caffeine and CGAs were higher in Cold Brew than Espresso coffees, as a function of the volume of beverage, which ranged from 30 mL (for espresso) to 120 mL (for filtered coffees). In light of these results, it is not possible to establish how many cups of coffee can be consumed per day without exceeding the recommended doses, since according to the applied brewing method, the content of the bioactive substances varies considerably.  aPublisher supplied data 3abioactive compounds 3abrewing 3acaffeine 3achemical analysis 3achlorogenic acid 3acoffee (beverage) 3alactones 3amarkets 3apH 3araw materials 3atotal dissolved solids 3aviscosity 0aBrewing methods 0aCoffee extraction 0aBioactive compounds 0aCaffeine 0aChlorogenic acids1 aGuerrini, Lorenzo1 aMasella, Piernicola1 aBellumori, Maria1 aDaluiso, Selvaggia1 aParenti, Alessandro1 aInnocenti, Marzia1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0320-83790 tFood research international.g2019 Feb., v. 116 p.1327-1335dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl48420x0963-99697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodres.2018.10.0223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02684naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245014500170300001800315520111000333592002801443650002601471650002701497650001901524650001601543650001201559650002001571650002201591650002301613650001501636650001601651650002201667650001301689650001501702650001001717650001801727650001701745650000901762653001801771653001501789653001501804653001501819653001901834700001401853700001401867700001701881700001901898700001701917773011301934856008602047852000902133655001202142IND60629809920221120070245.0210118e201902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062980992DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodres.2018.10.0232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Shengsheng10aEffects of proteome changes on the tenderness of yak rumen smooth muscle during postmortem storage based on the label-free mass spectrometry  ap. 1336-1343.  aA label-free proteomics method was used to explore the effects of differentially expressed proteins on the tenderness of yak rumen smooth muscle during postmortem storage (0, 3 and 7 days) at 3 ± 1 °C. The tenderness improved significantly during storage. A total of 212 differentially expressed proteins were identified by the following comparisons: Day 3 vs.0, day 7 vs.0, and day 7 vs.3. Twenty-eight proteins were correlated with the WBSF of yak rumen smooth muscle. Calpastatin, ADP/ATP translocase 1, zyxin, LMOD1 protein, tropomyosin α-3 chain, thrombospondin-4 and UQCRC1 protein are highly related to smooth muscle tenderness, and thus, they are candidates indicators of yak rumen smooth muscle tenderness during storage. Furthermore, bioinformatics analyses revealed that the identified proteins were related to focal adhesion, vascular smooth muscle contraction, cardiac muscle contraction and necroptosis. The present results could provide proteomic insights into changes in yak rumen smooth muscle tenderness during storage and may be a valuable resource for future investigations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadenosine diphosphate 3aadenosine triphosphate 3abioinformatics 3acalpastatin 3aenzymes 3afocal adhesions 3amass spectrometry 3amuscle contraction 3amyocardium 3anecroptosis 3aprotein synthesis 3aproteome 3aproteomics 3arumen 3asmooth muscle 3atropomyosins 3ayaks 0aSmooth muscle 0aProteomics 0aTenderness 0aLabel-free 0aBioinformatics1 aYu, Qunli1 aHan, Ling1 aZhang, Yimin1 aTian, Xiaojing1 aZhao, Suonan0 tFood research international.g2019 Feb., v. 116 p.1336-1343dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl48420x0963-99697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodres.2018.10.0233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03004naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004100111040001800152100002700170245012000197300001600317520152000333592002801853650002901881650002401910650001101934650001501945650001301960650001201973650001301985650001001998650001802008650001202026650003802038650003202076650001102108650002402119650001702143650001102160650005202171650001802223651001202241651001202253700002102265700002702286773010102313856008702414852000902501655001202510IND4467030920221118020042.0141112e20120515xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446703092DNAL7 a224810552pmid7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2012.03.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBalistrieri, Laurie S.10aAssessing time-integrated dissolved concentrations and predicting toxicity of metals during diel cycling in streams  ap. 155-168.  aEvaluating water quality and the health of aquatic organisms is challenging in systems with systematic diel (24h) or less predictable runoff-induced changes in water composition. To advance our understanding of how to evaluate environmental health in these dynamic systems, field studies of diel cycling were conducted in two streams (Silver Bow Creek and High Ore Creek) affected by historical mining activities in southwestern Montana. A combination of sampling and modeling tools was used to assess the toxicity of metals in these systems. Diffusive Gradients in Thin Films (DGT) samplers were deployed at multiple time intervals during diel sampling to confirm that DGT integrates time-varying concentrations of dissolved metals. Site specific water compositions, including time-integrated dissolved metal concentrations determined from DGT, a competitive, multiple-toxicant biotic ligand model, and the Windemere Humic Aqueous Model Version 6.0 (WHAM VI) were used to determine the equilibrium speciation of dissolved metals and biotic ligands. The model results were combined with previously collected toxicity data on cutthroat trout to derive a relationship that predicts the relative survivability of these fish at a given site. This integrative approach may prove useful for assessing water quality and toxicity of metals to aquatic organisms in dynamic systems and evaluating whether potential changes in environmental health of aquatic systems are due to anthropogenic activities or natural variability.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanthropogenic activities 3aaquatic environment 3amodels 3aprediction 3asamplers 3astreams 3atoxicity 3atrout 3awater quality 2aAnimals 2aEnvironmental Monitoringxmethods 2aMetalsxanalysisxtoxicity. 2aMining 2aModels, Theoretical 2aOncorhynchus 2aRivers 2aWater Pollutants, Chemicalxanalysisxtoxicity. 2aWater Quality 3aMontana 0aMontana1 aNimick, David A.1 aMebane, Christopher A.0 tScience of the total environment.g2012 May 15, v. 425 p.155-168dElsevier B.V.x0048-96977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2012.03.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03296naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100002400188245013900212300001600351506007600367520147900443592002801922506003701950650002001987650002102007650001802028650001702046650001602063650001802079650002102097650001802118650001402136650002702150650001302177650002502190650002102215650001402236650001802250650002402268650003302292650001002325650001302335650001302348650001002361700002102371700002202392700002202414700002302436700003002459700002502489773010202514856008102616852000902697655001202706IND60522638520221207084227.0160603e201606  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052263852DNAL7 a10.1007/s11130-016-0537-62doi7 aPMC48913932pmcid7 a269243122pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDziedzic, Krzysztof10aEffect of Wheat Dietary Fiber Particle Size during Digestion In Vitro on Bile Acid, Faecal Bacteria and Short-Chain Fatty Acid Content  ap. 151-157.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe influence of bile acid concentration on the growth of Bifidobacterium spp. and Lactobacillus spp. bacteria was demonstrated. Exposing these bacteria to the environment containing bile acid salts, and very poor in nutrients, leads to the disappearance of these microorganisms due to the toxic effect of bile acids. A multidimensional analysis of data in the form of principal component analysis indicated that lactic acid bacteria bind bile acids and show antagonistic effect on E. coli spp. bacteria. The growth in E. coli spp. population was accompanied by a decline in the population of Bifidobacterium spp. and Lactobacillus spp. with a simultaneous reduction in the concentration of bile acids. This is direct proof of acid binding ability of the tested lactic acid bacteria with respect to cholic acid, lithocholic acid and deoxycholic acid. This research demonstrated that the degree of fineness of wheat dietary fibre does not affect the sorption of bile acids and growth of some bacteria species; however, it has an impact on the profile of synthesized short-chained fatty acids. During the digestion of a very fine wheat fibre fraction (WF 90), an increase in the concentration of propionic and butyric acids, as compared with the wheat fiber fraction of larger particles - WF 500, was observed. Our study suggested that wheat fibre did not affect faecal bacteria growth, however, we observed binding of bile acids by Bifidobacterium spp. and Lactobacillus spp.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aBifidobacterium 3aEscherichia coli 3aLactobacillus 3abutyric acid 3acholic acid 3adata analysis 3adeoxycholic acid 3adietary fiber 3adigestion 3afatty acid composition 3afineness 3alactic acid bacteria 3alithocholic acid 3anutrients 3aparticle size 3apopulation dynamics 3aprincipal component analysis 3asalts 3asorption 3atoxicity 3awheat1 aSzwengiel, Artur1 aGórecka, Danuta,1 aGujska, Elżbieta1 aKaczkowska, Joanna1 aDrożdżyńska, Agnieszka1 aWalkowiak, Jarosław0 tPlant foods for human nutrition.g2016 June, v. 71, no. 2 p.151-157dSpringer USx0921-96687nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11130-016-0537-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01650naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002900147245008900176520066800265592002800933650001000961650001600971650001100987650002100998653002001019653001401039653001701053653001301070653002901083700002801112773009401140856008101234852000901315655001201324IND60725106320221119105247.0210124e201910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072510632DNAL7 a10.1016/j.dib.2019.1044032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCordeiro, Natal Henrique10aData used for detection and tracking of dynamic objects for visually impaired people  aThis paper presents in detail the methodology for the detection and tracking of dynamic objects from the article in press (A new methodology applied to dynamic object detection and tracking systems for visually impaired people [1]).

In this trial, a total of 60 male and 120 female quails, 91 days old, were randomly distributed in six experimental groups. During the 60-day experiment period, birds were fed with six treatment diets. Performances, eggshell qualities, hatchability, and mineral excretion data were evaluated at the end of the experiment. Results showed that the different dietary levels of essential oil mixture had no significant effect on performance parameters, damaged eggs, eggshell weight, fertility, hatchability of fertile eggs, hatchability of set eggs, and lead and boron excretion. On the other hand, 50 mg/kg supplementation of essential oil mixture (EOM) significantly improved egg-breaking strength and eggshell thickness, and ash, calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, manganese, zinc, and cadmium excretion was significantly depressed in quail breeders supplemented with the two higher doses (400 or 600 mg/kg) of EOM. These results concluded that supplementing diets with EOM improved egg-breaking strength and decreased excretion of minerals in breeder quails.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNigella sativa 3aanise 3aboron 3acadmium 3acalcium 3adietary supplements 3aegg shell 3aegg shell thickness 3aeggs 3aessential oils 3aexcretion 3afeed additives 3afennel 3alead 3amagnesium 3amanganese 3aminerals 3aphosphorus 3aquails 3areproductive traits 3arosemary 3athyme 3azinc1 aYıldız, Alp Önder0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research international.g2014 Dec., v. 21, no. 23 p.13434-13439dSpringer-Verlagx0944-13447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-014-3285-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01859naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001800149245010800167300001800275500001900293520051600312592002800828650001200856650002300868650002500891650002900916650001800945650002800963650002000991700001901011700001701030700005701047700001801104700001701122700005401139700005501193773012101248856008301369852000901452655001201461IND60718145420221118083035.0201120e20201109xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071814542DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.orglett.0c032362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZheng, Limeng10aTertiary Amines Acting as Alkyl Radical Equivalents Enabled by a P/N Heteroleptic Cu(I) Photosensitizer  ap. 8888-8893.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aAn unprecedented exploration of tertiary amines as alkyl radical equivalents for cross-coupling with aromatic alkynes to access allylarenes has been achieved by a P/N heteroleptic Cu(I)-based photosensitizer under photoredox catalysis conditions.

Sites were selected from a pool of naturally similar sub-basins (eco-region, basin size, and geology) of the Mobile River basin (MRB), using an index of urban intensity derived from infrastructure, socioeconomic, and land-use data. This urban land-use gradient (ULUG) is a multimetric indicator of urban intensity, ranging from 0 (background) to 100 (intense urbanization). Campostoma sp. have been used previously as indicators of stream health and are common species found in all sites within the MRB. Endpoints used to determine the effects of urban land-use on the largescale stoneroller included total glutathione, histology, hepatic apoptosis, condition factor and external lesions. Liver glutathione levels were positively associated with increasing urban land-use (r² = 0.94). Histopathological examination determined that some abnormalities and lesions were correlated with the ULUG and generally increased in prevalence or severity with increasing urbanization. Liver macrophage aggregates were positively correlated to the ULUG. The occurrence of nucleosomal ladders (indicating apoptotic cell death) did not correspond with urban intensity in a linear fashion. Apoptosis, as well as prevalence and severity of a myxozoan parasite, appeared to have a hormetic dose–response relationship. The majority of the biomarkers suggested fish health was compromised in areas where the ULUG ≥ 36.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCampostoma 3aapoptosis 3abasins 3abiomarkers 3acondition factor 3acorrelation 3adose response 3aecoregions 3afish health 3aglutathione 3ahistology 3ahistopathology 3ainfrastructure 3aland use 3aliver 3amacrophages 3aparasites 3aspring 3astreams 3aurbanization 3awatersheds 3aAlabama1 aBlack, M.

At the early life stage, the fertilized eggs were exposed to 1–1000 ng/L diethylstilbestrol (DES) for 15 days and the hatched larvae were continually exposed to the same concentrations for an additional 25 days. Significant adverse effects on hatchability, time to hatching and mortality rate occurred at DES concentrations of 100 and 1000 ng/L, while the abnormality (scoliosis and abdominal swelling) rate was significantly increased at 10 ng/L and above. After exposure, the fish were maintained in charcoal-dechlorinated tap water for a further 30 days. Only the male gonadosomatic index (GSI) at 1000 ng/L was significantly increased. At concentrations greater than 1 ng/L, estrogen receptor α (ERα) mRNA in both sexes and vitellogenin-I (Vtg-I) mRNA in males were significantly down-regulated; while Vtg-I mRNA in females was significantly up-regulated. When sexually mature medaka were exposed to 10 and 1000 ng/L DES for 21 days, only the GSI in females was significantly decreased at 1000 ng/L. At 10 and 1000 ng/L, ERα mRNA in both sexes was significantly down-regulated, while Vtg-I mRNA in males was significantly up-regulated. These findings showed that DES at the environmental concentration of 10 ng/L can affect the early life stage development of medaka and alter liver ERα and Vtg-I gene expression. Therefore, if we only focused on these sensitive toxicity endpoints such as ERα and Vtg-I mRNA expression, DES has a strong estrogenic effect on Japanese medaka.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOryzias latipes 3aadults 3aadverse effects 3adiethylstilbestrol 3aearly development 3aeggs 3aestrogen receptors 3aestrogenic properties 3afemales 3afish 3agene expression 3agene expression regulation 3agonadosomatic index 3ahatching 3alarvae 3aliver 3amales 3amessenger RNA 3amortality 3ascoliosis 3atap water 3atoxicity 3avitellogenin1 aPeng, Wei1 aLi, Wei1 aYu, Yingxin1 aXu, Jie1 aWang, Yipei0 tEcotoxicology.g2016 Apr., v. 25, no. 3 p.563-573dSpringer USx0963-92927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10646-016-1615-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02898naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001400147245013500161300001600296520165000312592002801962650002001990650002202010650002502032650001702057650001102074650002202085650003202107650001802139650002002157650002302177650002102200650001002221700001402231700001502245700001602260700002002276773010202296856008102398852000902479655001202488IND60522638920221121021740.0160603e201606  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052263892DNAL7 a10.1007/s11130-016-0549-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHa, K.-S.10aStimulation of Phenolics, Antioxidant and α-Glucosidase Inhibitory Activities During Barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) Seed Germination  ap. 211-217.  aThe rationale of this study was to enhance the nutritional quality of dry barley seeds. In this study we are evaluating the effect of germination on barley seeds relevant to total phenolic contents, antioxidant activity (in terms of DPPH free-radical scavenging) and the in vitro α-glucosidase inhibitory activities. Barley seeds were germinated for 18.5, 24, 30, 48, and 67 h and then extracted in water. The total phenolic contents, antioxidant activities and α-glucosidase inhibitory activities changed with germination time. More specifically, within the first 48 h of germination the total phenolic content increased from 1.1 mg/g fresh weight (0 h) to 3.4 mg/g fresh weight (48 h) and then slightly reduced by 67 h. Similarly, α-glucosidase inhibitory activity was significantly increased from an IC₅₀ 128.82 mg/mL (0 h) to an IC₅₀ 18.88 mg/mL (48 h) and then slightly reduced by 67 h. Significant maltase inhibitory activity was observed only with 48 h-germinated extract. Antioxidant activities increased continuously from an IC₅₀ 15.72 mg/mL at 0 h to and IC₅₀ 5.72 mg/mL after 48 h of germination. Based on our observations, barley seed germination was over after 48 h. During the progress of germination phenolic compounds are becoming available and are more easily extracted. After 48 h, lignification is initiated resulting to the decreased total phenolic content and observed antioxidant and carbohydrate hydrolyzing enzyme inhibition activities. The above results indicate the positive effect of germination in barley seeds for enhanced antioxidant and α-glucosidase inhibitory activities.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHordeum vulgare 3aalpha-glucosidase 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3abarley 3aenzyme inhibition 3ainhibitory concentration 50 3alignification 3anutritive value 3aphenolic compounds 3aseed germination 3aseeds1 aJo, S.-H.1 aMannam, V.1 aKwon, Y.-I.1 aApostolidis, E.0 tPlant foods for human nutrition.g2016 June, v. 71, no. 2 p.211-217dSpringer USx0921-96687nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11130-016-0549-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02090naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245011300157300002200270520074000292592002801032650001601060650002101076650001901097650001501116650002101131650001501152650001101167650001301178650001901191650002401210650001901234650001801253650001101271650001601282650001401298700001501312700001401327700001801341700001601359700001901375700001601394773012701410856007401537852000901611655001201620IND60641165420221120185107.0190505e20161024xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064116542DNAL7 a10.1039/c6ra18732c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Jingxuan10aNovel NiCo₂S₄@reduced graphene oxide@carbon nanotube nanocomposites for high performance supercapacitors  ap. 100504-100510.  aWe present a simple one-step solvothermal method for in situ growth of nickel cobalt sulfide (NiCo₂S₄) nanoparticles on the reduced graphene oxide (rGO) sheets and carbon nanotube (CNT) without adding any surfactant.

Its durability is mainly owing to the synergistic effects of NiCo₂S₄, rGO and CNT, further presenting potential applications in energy storage.  aPublisher supplied data 3acapacitance 3acarbon nanotubes 3acobalt sulfide 3adurability 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3aenergy 3agraphene 3agraphene oxide 3ahot water treatment 3ananocomposites 3ananoparticles 3anickel 3asurfactants 3asynergism1 aYang, Yang1 aChu, Hang1 aTang, Jianhua1 aGe, Yuancai1 aShen, Jianfeng1 aYe, Mingxin0 tRSC advances.g2016 Oct. 24, v. 6, no. 102 p.100504-100510dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c6ra18732c3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02261naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002200152245010600174300001600280520124200296592002801538650002201566650001101588650002501599650000901624650001501633653002101648653002101669653001601690653003301706773010101739856008601840852000901926655001201935IND60561837020221122220635.0170719e20170315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056183702DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enconman.2016.12.0452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFathabadi, Hassan10aNovel wind powered electric vehicle charging station with vehicle-to-grid (V2G) connection capability  ap. 229-239.  aIn this study, a novel grid-connected wind powered electric vehicle (EV) charging station with vehicle-to-grid (V2G) technology is designed and constructed. The wind powered EV charging station consists of a wind energy conversion system (WECS), a unidirectional DC/DC converter connected to the WECS, a maximum power point tracking (MPPT) controller, 15 bidirectional DC/DC converters dedicated to 15 charging stations provided for charging EVs, and a three-phase bidirectional DC/AC inverter connected to the grid. The contribution of this work is that the grid-connected wind powered EV charging station presented in this work is the only constructed EV charging station reported in the literature that uses wind energy as a renewable resource to produce electric energy for charging EVs, and moreover, it maximally converts wind energy into electric energy because it uses a novel fast and highly accurate MPPT technique proposed in this study. Other works are only simulated models without any new MPPT consideration. It is demonstrated that the constructed wind powered EV charging station is a perfect charging station that not only produces electric energy to charge EVs but also balances load demand in the grid connected to it.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenergy conversion 3amodels 3avehicles (equipment) 3awind 3awind power 0aElectric vehicle 0aCharging station 0aWind energy 0aMaximum power point tracking0 tEnergy conversion and management.g2017 Mar. 15, v. 136 p.229-239dElsevier Ltdx0196-89047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enconman.2016.12.0453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02687naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245010600166300001600272520139800288592002801686650001301714650001701727650001001744650001601754650002101770650001301791650001401804650003901818650002501857650001601882650003301898650001301931651001101944700002301955700002101978700002501999700002102024700001602045773010202061856008102163852000902244655001202253IND60522639020221121021745.0160603e201606  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052263902DNAL7 a10.1007/s11130-016-0548-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFan, Gong-Jian10aComparison of Phytochemicals and Antioxidant Capacity in Three Bean Varieties Grown in Central Malawi  ap. 204-210.  aThe aims of the current work were: (1) to study the influence of variety and geographical production area on the total phenolic content, total anthocyanin content, total flavonoid content, total carotenoid content and antioxidant activity in bean varieties (Dimeta, Napirira and Nanyati) from different growing areas in central Malawi, and (2) to evaluate the possibility of establishing a classification based on the geographical areas of the growing regions. A total of 47 bean samples were collected from Makowe, Mphathi, Chuma-Chitsala and Khulungira Zone. These four locations were segregated based on altitude, latitude and longitude. Principal component and hierarchical cluster analysis were used to distinguish and classify among these samples. Significant differences (P < 0.05) in total phenolic content (2.92–4.97 mg/g), total anthocyanin content (14.52–152.31 μg/g), total flavonoid content (2.01–6.38 mg/g) and oxygen radical absorbance capacity (16.75–24.51 μmol/g) were found among the different sampled villages, showing a significant effect of the producing region on these parameters. The beans in Makowe had lower polyphenols than in other locations. Results of principal component analysis indicate that phytochemicals and antioxidant capacity could serve as parameters to establish a bean classification according to the geographical area of production.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaltitude 3aanthocyanins 3abeans 3acarotenoids 3acluster analysis 3alatitude 3alongitude 3aoxygen radical absorbance capacity 3aphytopharmaceuticals 3apolyphenols 3aprincipal component analysis 3avillages 3aMalawi1 aNdolo, Victoria U.1 aKatundu, Mangani1 aBezner Kerr, Rachel,1 aArntfield, Susan1 aBeta, Trust0 tPlant foods for human nutrition.g2016 June, v. 71, no. 2 p.204-210dSpringer USx0921-96687nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11130-016-0548-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03310naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002100153245017100174300001400345520155900359592002801918650002401946650001701970650002801987650002502015650002302040650001502063650001202078650001302090650001802103650001502121650001202136650001402148650001202162650002602174651001102200653002202211653002902233653002302262653002302285653002402308700001902332700001902351700006202370700002202432700002102454700006902475700001902544773010802563856008802671852000902759655001202768IND60629810620221121081722.0190321e20190415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062981062DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2019.01.0242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLebreton, Benoit10aFrom ecological relevance of the ecosystem services concept to its socio-political use. The case study of intertidal bare mudflats in the Marennes-Oléron Bay, France  ap. 41-54.  aAssessments based on monetary valuation of ecosystem services have been increasingly used as a tool to highlight the connection between ecosystems and society. The dissemination of this approach is leading to difficulties and ambiguities related to the use of such assessments in the socio-political realm. Such limits can be stressed using the case study of intertidal bare mudflats. These coastal habitats indeed provide many ecological functions—several being related to the high production of benthic microalgae—but also remain poorly known for some other aspects. The major users of these habitats (i.e. oyster farmers) are still unaware about the trophic role of benthic microalgae, limiting contingent valuation survey methods. Moreover, economic valuation cannot take into account the potentials of mudflats (i.e. undescribed functions) like positive feedbacks related to shellfish farming and provision of bioactive compounds. The lack of physical boundaries in marine systems also strongly reduces the effectiveness of assessments. Lastly, there are concerns that monetary valuation can lead to a commodification of the nature or to the economization of the environment (e.g. appropriation of the environment by users, creation of artificial thresholds). The evaluation of the functions of a socio-ecosystem should not only be restricted to a monetary assessment of its ecosystem services, as this framework may be more reductive than integrative. Some other descriptors—not based on currencies—should be used for ecosystem description.  aPublisher supplied data 3abioactive compounds 3acase studies 3acoastal zone management 3acontingent valuation 3aecosystem services 3aecosystems 3afarmers 3ahabitats 3alittoral zone 3amicroalgae 3aoysters 3ashellfish 3asurveys 3atrophic relationships 3aFrance 0aCoastal ecosystem 0aIntertidal bare mudflats 0aEcosystem services 0aEconomic valuation 0aSocio-political use1 aRivaud, Audrey1 aPicot, Laurent1 aPrévost, Benoît,1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5758-59331 aBarillé, Laurent1 aSauzeau, Thierry1 aBeseres Pollack, Jennifer1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2995-40061 aLavaud, Johann0 tOcean & coastal management.g2019 Apr. 15, v. 172 p.41-54dElsevier LtdwJournal:11975x0964-56917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2019.01.0243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02915naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002500147245009600172300001600268520138200284592002801666650001901694650001901713650001601732650001901748650001101767650002501778650001601803650001301819650003201832650001501864650002101879650002301900650003701923653002701960653001901987653003102006653001502037653002002052700002402072700003502096700002002131700001602151700002202167700002002189700002002209773007802229856008102307852000902388655001202397IND50067068420221121022649.0160511e20130613xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006706842DNAL7 a10.2478/s11756-013-0201-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDanišovič, Ľuboš10aComprehensive characterization of human adipose tissue-derived stem cells expanded in vitro  ap. 747-753.  aAdipose tissue seems to be a rich and safe source of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). The present study was aimed to investigate the biological and morphological characteristics of human adipose tissue-derived stem cells (ATSCs). Light and transmission electron microscopy were used. Course of proliferation was analyzed by growth curve. Expression of surface antigens was assessed by flow cytometry. Chondrogenic potential was assessed by immunohistochemistry. Obtained results showed morphology typical of fibroblastoid cells. TEM analysis proved ultrastructural morphology similar to MSCs from other sources. ATSCs reflected their proteosynthetic and metabolic activity. Each cell had irregular shape of nucleus with noticeable nucleoli. Abundant cisterns of rough endoplasmic reticulum were present in their cytoplasm. Karyotype mapping showed normal count of human chromosomes (46,XX). The growth curve revealed high capability for proliferation and population doubling time was 27.36 hours. ATSCs were positive for CD13, CD29, CD44, CD73, CD90, CD105 and CD106, but did not express CD14, CD34, CD45 and HLA-DR. It was also proved that ATSCs underwent chondrogenic differentiation in vitro. On the basis of obtained results it should be emphasized that ATSCs are typical MSCs and after further investigations they may be used in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadipose tissue 3acell nucleolus 3achromosomes 3aflow cytometry 3ahumans 3aimmunohistochemistry 3akaryotyping 3amedicine 3arough endoplasmic reticulum 3astem cells 3asurface antigens 3atissue engineering 3atransmission electron microscopy 0amesenchymal stem cells 0aadipose tissue 0abiological characteristics 0amorphology 0adifferentiation1 aKuniaková, Marcela1 aVarchulová-Nováková, Zuzana1 aBoháč, Martin1 aVarga, Ivan1 aRusnáková, Jana1 aPolák, Štefan1 aBöhmer, Daniel0 tBiologia.g2013 June 13, v. 68, no. 4 p.747-753dVersitax1336-95637nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2478/s11756-013-0201-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04071naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100001700166245016300183300002000346520240700366592002802773650002502801650001602826650002402842650002602866650001202892650002402904650002202928650001602950650001502966650001702981650001702998650001103015650001503026650001403041650001503055650000903070650000703079650001403086650001703100650001503117650001103132650001803143650001903161650001503180650001603195651001703211651001303228700003603241773013803277856008103415852000903496655001203505IND60119097920221120232906.0141130e201412  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011909792DNAL7 a250178712pmid7 a10.1007/s11356-014-3307-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLopes, Aline10aExperimental study on the survival of the water hyacinth (Eichhornia crassipes (Mart.) Solms—Pontederiaceae) under different oil doses and times of exposure  ap. 13503-13511.  aIn the last decades, petroleum activities have increased in the Brazilian Amazon where there is oil exploration on the Urucu River, a tributary of the Amazon River, about 600 km from the city of Manaus. Particularly, transportation via the Amazon River to reach the oil refinery in Manaus may compromise the integrity of the large floodplains that flank hundreds of kilometers of this major river. In the Amazon floodplains, plant growth and nutrient cycling are related to the flood pulse. When oil spills occur, floating oil on the water surface is dispersed through wind and wave action in the littoral region, thus affecting the vegetation of terrestrial and aquatic environments. If pollutants enter the system, they are absorbed by plants and distributed in the food chain via plant consumption, mortality, and decomposition. The effect of oil on the growth and survival of vegetation in these environments is virtually unknown. The water hyacinth [Eichhornia crassipes (Mart.) Solms] has a pantropical distribution but is native to the Amazon, often growing in high-density populations in the floodplains where it plays an important role as shelter and food source for aquatic and terrestrial biota. The species is well known for its high capacity to absorb and tolerate high levels of heavy metal ions. To study the survival and response of water hyacinth under six different oil doses, ranging from 0 to 150 ml l⁻¹, and five exposure times (1, 5, 10, 15, and 20 days), young individuals distributed in a completely randomized design experiment composed of vessels with a single individual each were followed over a 50-day period (30-day acclimatization, 20 days under oil treatments). Growth parameters, biomass, visual changes in the plants, and pH were recorded at 1, 5, 10, 15, and 20 days. Increasing the time of oil exposure caused a decrease in biomass, ratio of live/dead biomass and length of leaves, and an increase in the number of dead leaves. Dose of oil and time of exposure are the most important factors controlling the effects of petroleum hydrocarbons on E. crassipes. Although the species is able to survive exposure to a moderate dose of oil, below 75 ml l⁻¹for only 5 days, severe alterations in plant growth and high mortality were observed. Therefore, we conclude that Urucu oil heavily affects E. crassipes despite its known resistance to many pollutants.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEichhornia crassipes 3aacclimation 3aaquatic environment 3abiogeochemical cycles 3abiomass 3aexperimental design 3aexposure duration 3afloodplains 3afood chain 3aheavy metals 3ahydrocarbons 3aleaves 3ametal ions 3amortality 3aoil spills 3aoils 3apH 3apetroleum 3aplant growth 3apollutants 3arivers 3asurface water 3atransportation 3avegetation 3awater waves 3aAmazon River 3aAmazonia1 aPiedade, Maria Teresa Fernandez0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research international.g2014 Dec., v. 21, no. 23 p.13503-13511dSpringer-Verlagx0944-13447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-014-3307-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02342naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001500152245010300167300001600270520099800286592002801284650002101312650002201333650002901355650001301384650002701397650001701424650001901441650001301460650000901473653002201482653001101504653001401515700005601529700001901585700001701604700001701621700001901638700002001657773013501677856008701812852000901899655001201908IND60622692320221122020203.0220214e20190215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062269232DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2018.11.0572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Linlin10aAntibacterial activity and cytotoxicity of l‑phenylalanine-oxidized starch-coordinated zinc (II)  ap. 133-139.  aZn (II) coordination compounds have aroused growing attentions as antibacterial entities. In the present work, we fabricated a new antibacterial complex of l‑phenylalanine‑oxidized starch-coordinated zinc (II) (l‑Phe-OSt→Zn (II)) by successive reactions of oxidization, Maillard and coordination. Maillard reaction occurred between l‑Phe and OSt to form l‑Phe-OSt, which was then coordinated with Zn (II) by carboxyl groups for l‑Phe-OSt→Zn (II). The complex showed good antibacterial activity and the antibacterial activity against E. coli was slightly poorer than B. subtilis. The presence of complex favored the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in bacteria and the ROS level in B. subtilis was higher than that in E. coli. Furthermore, the toxicity of l‑Phe-OSt→Zn (II) towards HT-29 cells was very low. The characteristics of better antibacterial activity and less cytotoxicity endow l‑Phe-OSt→Zn (II) a great potential of application as a food additive.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aMaillard reaction 3aantibacterial properties 3abacteria 3acoordination compounds 3acytotoxicity 3afood additives 3amoieties 3azinc 0al‑phenylalanine 0aStarch 0aZinc (II)1 aWang, Hualin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2516-67741 aJin, Chongyang1 aChen, Minmin1 aJiang, Suwei1 aCheng, Junfeng1 aJiang, Shaotong0 tInternational journal of biological macromolecules.g2019 Feb. 15, v. 123 p.133-139dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12340x0141-81307nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2018.11.0573Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03340naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001700143245010000160300001600260506002800276520210600304592002802410506003702438650002502475650002402500650001102524650001602535650001302551650001402564650001202578650001702590650001402607650001702621650001502638650001302653650002602666651001402692773013702706856007802843852000902921655001202930IND60784509820221207100501.0180213e201306  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078450982DNAL7 a10.25026/jtpc.v2i2.552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRijai, Laode10aPOTENSI HERBA TUMBUHAN BALSEM (Polygala paniculata Linn) SEBAGAI SUMBER BAHAN FARMASI POTENSIAL  ap. 105-112.  aResource is Open Access  aTumbuhan balsem (P. paniculata) merupakan tumbuhan semusim yaitu dari biji lalu tumbuh dan akan mati setelah mencapai dewasa selama 4-5 bulan.

In this study, we evaluated the morphology, histochemistry, and ultrastructure of the seminal receptacle of juvenile and adult females of Callinectes danae along the different stages of ovarian development. We described the histochemical changes that take place inside the SR, from the sperm plug formation until fertilization. We also quantified the amount of seminal fluid received by the females during copulation. Callinectes danae has a dorsal-type SR, which is common in Portunidae. The sperm plug is formed by the orderly deposition of seminal fluid of the anterior and median vas deferens, which in turn influences the secretion of the posterior region and produces chemically distinct strata. The dissolution of the sperm plug inside the SR occurs in synchrony with the spermatophore dehiscence and ovarian development. A holocrine secretion from dense layer cells dissolves the sperm plug. These cells have electron-dense and electron-lucid vesicles. The plug is completely dissolved when the females are at the intermediary ovarian development. At this stage, the SR dense layer folds and forms the lateral chamber. The dorsal oviduct, continuous to the dense layer, moves to a ventral-lateral position opposed to the vagina. During ovulation, the oocytes of mature females pass through the oviduct and the fertilization occurs almost above the vagina. The male ejaculates all its seminal fluid in a single copulation, leading to a total sperm depletion. Therefore, the whole sperm plug is produced by the males, through the combined secretions from three vas deferens regions. We show, for the first time, that the secretions from the anterior vas deferens also participate in the sperm plug formation. The female dissolves the plug, which is a crucial morphological change of the SR during the processes of fertilization and egg release. In species of Callinectes there was a clear co-evolution between the male and female reproductive systems: the male invests all its reproductive potential to build the sperm plug, and the female, to dissolve it.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCallinectes danae 3aadults 3acoevolution 3acopulation 3acrabs 3adehiscence 3aeggs 3afemales 3ahistochemistry 3ainsemination 3ajuveniles 3amales 3aoocytes 3aovarian development 3aoviducts 3aovulation 3asecretion 3aspermatophores 3aspermatozoa 3aultrastructure 3avagina 0aOviduct 0aSeminal fluid 0aSpermatozoon 0aStorage1 aToyama, Marcos H.1 aZara, Fernando J.0 tZoologischer Anzeiger.g2021 Mar., v. 291 p.45-60dElsevier GmbHwJournal:6280x0044-52317nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcz.2021.02.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02658naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002100146245014300167300001400310500001900324520131600343592002801659650001001687650001601697650001701713650002701730650002701757650002401784650002101808650001301829653003101842653002301873653003001896653001301926700002101939700002001960700001901980700001901999773012902018856008002147852000902227655001202236IND60685695320221119120548.0200306e20200201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068569532DNAL7 a10.2478/prolas-2020-00062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIevinsh, Gederts10aPhysiological Responses of Wetland Species Rumex Hydrolapathum to Increased Concentration of Biogenous Heavy Metals Zn and Mn in Substrate  ap. 35-47.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe aim of the present study was to determine if individuals of Rumex hydrolapathum Huds native to saline wetlands are able to tolerate high concentration of biogenous heavy metals Zn and Mn in substrate and to accumulate high concentration of these metals in aboveground parts. Plant physiological status was monitored by using non-destructive analysis of chlorophyll and chlorophyll a fluorescence. R. hydrolapathum plants accumulated up to 1840 mg·kg⁻¹ Zn and 6400 mg·kg⁻¹ Mn in older leaves. The usefulness of monitoring changes in chlorophyll concentration and chlorophyll a fluorescence parameters to predict physiological response of R. hydrolapathum plants to excess Zn and Mn was not supported, as the lack of significant changes indicated that the model species showed adaptation to increased amount of metals in actively photosynthesizing tissues. It appears that Zn and Mn tolerance of R. hydrolapathum is based primarily at the physiological level where metal accumulation in younger leaves and roots is restricted, and development of new leaves is promoted together with induction of senescence in older leaves that have accumulated the majority of Zn and Mn. R. hydrolapathum can be characterised as a very promising model species for further studies for practical phytoremediation needs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRumex 3achlorophyll 3afluorescence 3anondestructive methods 3aphysiological response 3aphysiological state 3aphytoremediation 3awetlands 0achlorophyll a fluorescence 0ametal accumulation 0aphytoextraction potential 0atoxicity1 aDišlere, Elīna1 aKarlsons, Andis1 aOsvalde, Anita1 aVikmane, Māra0 tProceedings of the Latvian Academy of Sciences.g2020 Feb. 01, v. 74, no. 1 p.35-47dSciendowJournal:21686x2255-890X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2478/prolas-2020-00063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02232naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245012800169300001300297520087100310592002801181650001101209650001701220650002001237650002601257650000901283650001501292650001701307650001501324650002301339650001201362650001301374651001801387653001401405653002301419653001601442653002801458653002901486700001801515700001801533700002301551773010501574856008601679852000901765655001201774IND60525291820221123022912.0190318e201601  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052529182DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aquaeng.2015.11.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDrach, Andrew10aEngineering procedures for design and analysis of submersible fish cages with copper netting for exposed marine environment  ap. 1-14.  aNovel design and analysis procedures are needed for engineering of the offshore fish farms utilizing copper alloy netting. Existing technologies developed for fish cages with polymer nets are not directly transferrable to the fish cages with copper netting. In particular, the structural integrity of fish cage/mooring systems, and initial high costs of fish cages with copper netting are two major concerns in the engineering for open ocean aquaculture. We propose the modified engineering procedures, which address these concerns and allow for retrofitting of existing fish farming systems with polymer nets. These procedures are illustrated by considering two case studies: design of a rigid-frame and flexible gravity-type fish cages. Performance of both designs is analyzed after the field trials in the North Atlantic and South Pacific oceans, correspondingly.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalloys 3acase studies 3afarming systems 3afield experimentation 3afish 3afish cages 3afish culture 3afish farms 3amarine environment 3anetting 3apolymers 3aPacific Ocean 0aFish cage 0aMarine aquaculture 0aCopper nets 0aFinite element analysis 0aHydrodynamics of netting1 aTsukrov, Igor1 aDeCew, Judson1 aCelikkol, Barbaros0 tAquacultural engineering.g2016 Jan., v. 70 p.1-14dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl33898x0144-86097nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaeng.2015.11.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01291naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002200144245006600166300001400232500001500246520023300261592002800494650001800522651001200540651001200552653001500564653001200579653001200591653000900603653001700612653001400629653001200643653001200655653001500667653001000682700002200692773009200714856007800806852000900884655001200893IND60568297820221120173923.0170504e20170422xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056829782DNAL7 a10.1515/vzoo-2017-00122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNazarenko, V.

Soybean possesses numerous coping strategies to conserve Pi utilization, while decreasing the C cost to promote nodule function during Pi stress. This could be achieved through the modulation of carbohydrate importation, mobilization of storage reserves, modification of respiratory pathways and exportation of nitrogenous (N) products. Under such circumstances, soybean regulates the C partitioning among the various nutrient-acquiring structures and the C flux through different metabolic pathways (primary and secondary). However, substantial genetic variation leading to nodule acclimation to Pi stress is notable and dependent on the crop genotypes and/or rhizobial strains that are in symbiosis. Several Pi deficiency-induced responses (e.g., mycorrhizal association, exudative burst and secondary metabolism) can act to increase the Pi levels in nodules, which are, unavoidably, often associated with a heavy burden to the overall C budget of the host. Alternative non-adenylate respiratory pathways (e.g., glycolytic bypass) and ureide export (i.e., less amide transport) are metabolically less expensive, and thus more favorable during Pi stress.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacclimation 3abotany 3acarbohydrates 3acarbon 3aexports 3agenetic variation 3aglycolysis 3ametabolites 3aphosphates 3asoybeans 3astarvation 3asymbiosis 0aAAT 0aAcCoA 0aAM 0aAS 0aASN 0aASP 0aBM 0aC 0aCIT 0aDctA/Dct 0aFRK 0aFUM 0aF-1,6-P2 0aF6P 0aGLN 0aGLU 0aGOGAT 0aGS 0aG1P 0aG6P 0aHXK 0aIMP 0aMAL 0aMDH 0aNAD+-ME 0aN 0aN2 0aN2ase 0aOAA 0a2OG 0aO2 0aPBM 0aPDC 0aPEP 0aPEPC 0a3PGA 0aPHB 0aPi 0aPK 0aPPi 0aPYR 0aSS 0aTRAP 0aUGPase 0aCarbon assimilation 0aMetabolic acclimation 0aNodule functioning 0aPi homeostasis 0aRespiration 0aSoybean1 aAbdelrahman, Mostafa1 aTran, Lam-son Phan,0 tEnvironmental and experimental botany.g2022 Apr., v. 196 p.104810-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl7512x0098-84727nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envexpbot.2022.1048103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03593naa a2200709 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002900164245020900193300001600402520139800418592002801816650001901844650001001863650001201873650002001885650001401905650002201919650001401941650001801955650001401973650001501987650001502002650000902017650001802026650000902044650001802053650002802071650004602099650001102145650002202156650003402178650005102212650006102263650001102324650001802335650002002353650000902373650002802382650001602410650002102426650002502447650002402472650002002496650001702516650002802533700001902561700002002580700002102600700001902621700001902640700001802659700002302677773008102700856008102781852000902862655001202871IND4451733020221121032718.0141112e201105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445173302DNAL7 a207391462pmid7 a10.1016/j.nut.2010.06.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBaumeister, Sebastian E.14aThe Geriatric Nutritional Risk Index predicts increased healthcare costs and hospitalization in a cohort of community-dwelling older adults: Results from the MONICA/KORA Augsburg cohort study, 1994–2005  ap. 534-542.  aOBJECTIVE: To determine if the Geriatric Nutritional Risk Index (GNRI), an index for the risk of nutrition-related complications, is associated with healthcare costs and risk of hospitalization at baseline and after 10 y. METHODS: Data from a German population-based cohort of 1999 subjects 55 to 74 y of age at baseline were used. Self-reported physician visits, length of hospital stay, and drug intake were used to estimate costs. The GNRI is based on serum albumin values and the discrepancy between real and ideal body weights. Low GNRI values were defined as mean minus 2 times standard deviation. Mean GNRI values were regarded as normal. RESULTS: Low baseline GNRI was consistently associated with increased total costs, probability of hospitalization, inpatient costs, and pharmaceutical costs at baseline and follow-up, after adjustment for socioeconomic characteristics, lifestyle factors, and coexisting conditions. Subjects with low GNRI at baseline had approximately 47% higher total costs, 50% higher risk of hospitalization, 62% higher inpatient costs and 27% higher pharmaceutical costs at follow-up than subjects with normal GNRI values. CONCLUSION: The GNRI risk predicted increased future healthcare costs and higher risk of hospitalization in independent-living older adults. The GNRI is a rapid and low-cost tool that might be routinely used in population-based settings.  aPublisher supplied data 3acohort studies 3adrugs 3aelderly 3ahealth services 3ahospitals 3aideal body weight 3alifestyle 3anormal values 3anutrition 3aphysicians 3aprediction 3arisk 3aserum albumin 2aAged 2aAnthropometry 2aCross-Sectional Studies 2aElder Nutritional Physiological Phenomena 2aFemale 2aFollow-Up Studies 2aGeriatric Assessmentxmethods 2aHealth Care Costsxstatistics & numerical data 2aHospitalizationxeconomicsxstatistics & numerical data. 2aHumans 2aLinear Models 2aLogistic Models 2aMale 2aMalnutritionxdiagnosis 2aMiddle Aged 2aModels, Economic 2aNutrition Assessment 2aProspective Studies 2aRisk Assessment 2aRisk Factors 2aSerum Albuminxanalysis1 aFischer, Beate1 aDöring, Angela1 aKoenig, Wolfgang1 aZierer, Astrid1 aJohn, Jürgen,1 aHeier, Margit1 aMeisinger, Christa0 tNutrition.g2011 May, v. 27, no. 5 p.534-542dElsevier Inc.x0899-90077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.nut.2010.06.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03771naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100005500140245014300195300001800338500002000356520197200376592002802348596006402376596009802440650001402538650003202552650001502584650002502599650002002624650001402644650001502658650001502673650001602688650002302704650003502727650001202762650001502774650001502789650002102804650002602825650002402851700002002875700001602895700006002911700006802971773014203039856007503181852000903256655001203265IND60784415520221120104214.0220726e202207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078441552DNAL7 a10.1111/jvim.164772doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKidd, Linda1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2464-079610aVector‐borne disease and its relationship to hematologic abnormalities and microalbuminuria in retired racing and show‐bred greyhounds  ap. 1287-1294.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aBACKGROUND: Reference intervals for platelets and white blood cell (WBCs) counts are lower in greyhounds than other breeds. Proteinuria is common. Vector‐borne diseases (VBD) cause thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, and proteinuria. Racing greyhounds are commonly exposed to vectors that carry multiple organisms capable of chronically infecting clinically healthy dogs. HYPOTHESIS/OBJECTIVES: Vector‐borne disease prevalence is higher in retired racing greyhounds than in show‐bred greyhounds. Occult infection contributes to breed‐related laboratory abnormalities. ANIMALS: Thirty National Greyhound Association (NGA) retired racing and 28 American Kennel Club (AKC) show‐bred greyhounds. METHODS: Peripheral blood was tested for Anaplasma, Babesia, Bartonella, Ehrlichia, hemotropic Mycoplasma, and Rickettsia species using PCR. Antibodies to Anaplasma, Babesia, Bartonella, Ehrlichia, and Rickettsia species and Borrelia burgdorferi were detected using immunofluorescence and ELISA assays. Complete blood counts, semiquantitative platelet estimates, and microalbuminuria concentration were determined. RESULTS: Seven of 30 NGA and 1/28 AKC greyhounds tested positive for ≥1 VBD (P = .05). More positive tests were documented in NGA (10/630) than in AKC dogs (1/588; P = .02). Exposure to Bartonella species (3/30), Babesia vogeli (2/30), Ehrlichia canis (1/30), and infection with Mycoplasma hemocanis (3/30) occurred in NGA dogs. Platelet counts or estimates were >170 000/μL. White blood cell counts <4000/μL (4/28 AKC; 5/30 NGA, P > .99; 1/8 VBD positive; 8/51 VBD negative, P = .99) and microalbuminuria (10/21 AKC; 5/26 NGA, P = .06; 1/8 VBD positive; 14/25 VBD negative, P = .41) were not associated with VBD. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: The prevalence of thrombocytopenia and B. vogeli exposure was lower than previously documented. Larger studies investigating the health impact of multiple VBD organisms are warranted.  aPublisher supplied data  aAKC02285‐AcAmerican Kennel Club Canine Health Foundation  aMatching Grants ProgramcWestern University of Health Sciences College of Veterinary Medicine 3aAnaplasma 3aBabesia canis subsp. vogeli 3aBartonella 3aBorrelia burgdorferi 3aEhrlichia canis 3aGreyhound 3aMycoplasma 3aRickettsia 3aalbuminuria 3adisease prevalence 3afluorescent antibody technique 3akennels 3aleukocytes 3aleukopenia 3athrombocytopenia 3avector-borne diseases 3aveterinary medicine1 aHamilton, Helen1 aStine, Lisa1 aQurollo, Barbara1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9849-25111 aBreitschwerdt, Edward B.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5179-37200 tJournal of veterinary internal medicine.g2022 July, v. 36, no. 4 p.1287-1294dJohn Wiley & Sons, Inc.wJournal:jnl43440x0891-66407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jvim.164773Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02437naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100005600152245016900208300001600377520089000393592002801283650002301311650001301334650002601347650001001373650002901383650001501412650002201427650001001449650002101459650001801480650001501498650001501513653002301528653002001551653003801571653001201609653001801621700001801639700002301657700002101680700006301701773010701764856008701871852000901958655001201967IND60605413020221120083938.0200621e20180920xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060541302DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfa.2018.05.0732doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDies, Hannah1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2772-141X10aSERS-from-scratch: An electric field-guided nanoparticle assembly method for cleanroom-free and low-cost preparation of surface-enhanced Raman scattering substrates  ap. 695-702.  aUltrasensitive detection of analytes is important in forensic science, environmental monitoring and medical diagnostics. Surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) is an analytical detection method with single-molecule sensitivity, but nanofabrication of SERS substrates poses a barrier to its application. Here, we report on a facile and rapid approach to prepare ultrasensitive SERS substrates in situ by using electrokinetics to assemble Ag nanoparticles on a scored conductive surface. We demonstrate the unique characteristic of our method to produce highly SERS-active surfaces from a wide range of materials, including commercially available glass slides pre-coated with indium tin oxide (ITO). We show that the “SERS from scratch” substrates can detect trace quantities of explosives, drugs and pesticides, with sensitivities superior to some commercially available products.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRaman spectroscopy 3acolloids 3adiagnostic techniques 3adrugs 3aenvironmental monitoring 3aexplosives 3aforensic sciences 3aglass 3aindium tin oxide 3ananoparticles 3ananosilver 3apesticides 0aColloidal assembly 0aElectrokinetics 0aSurface-enhanced Raman scattering 0aSensors 0aNanoparticles1 aNosrati, Reza1 aRaveendran, Joshua1 aEscobedo, Carlos1 aDocoslis, Aristides1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5284-01810 tColloids and surfaces.g2018 Sept. 20, v. 553 p.695-702dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11945x0927-77577nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfa.2018.05.0733Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01797naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100002000112245006800132300001200200520085200212592002801064650003401092650002401126650001001150650001001160650001201170650002401182650001201206650001301218650001401231650001301245650002901258651001001287651001801297773012301315852000901438655001201447IND60331800320221122000537.0150727e20150508xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6033180032DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNormile, Dennis10aJapan's ‘NIH’ starts with modest funding but high ambitions  ap. 616.  aAfter several years of planning, on 1 April Japan launched its Agency for Medical Research and Development (AMED).

Prime Minister Shinzo Abe is counting on AMED to move drugs and medical technologies from the bench to the clinic and the market. Japan has been weak in reaping the benefits of basic biomedical discoveries partly because governmental support for the field has been split among three ministries. But AMED has a long way to go before it will have the resources and clout of its U.S. counterpart.

OBJECTIVES: To compare clinical features and survival time of lymphoma in MD and non‐MD. ANIMALS: One hundred and eight MDs with lymphoma and 149 non‐MD breed dogs with lymphoma were included in the study. METHODS: This was a retrospective multicenter observational study. Lymphoma was classified based on signalment, histopathology/cytology, and anatomical site of the disease. For each type of lymphoma, median survival time was analyzed by Kaplan‐Meier estimates and life table analysis. Prognostic factors for large‐cell gastrointestinal lymphoma (LGIL) were analyzed using Cox regression. RESULTS: Gastrointestinal lymphomas were more common in MDs (53/108) compared to non‐MDs (41/149). The multicentric lymphoma was most common in non‐MD breed dogs (74/149) compared to MDs (33/108). The median age that dog developed lymphoma in MD and non‐MD were both 10 years old; however, lymphomas were more frequently observed in younger dogs (<4 years) in MDs (20/108) compared to non‐MDs (9/149; P = .002). Seventy percent were diagnosed with B‐cell with median age of diagnosis was 3 (1‐14) years. Mott cell differentiation was observed in 6 dogs. Age <4 years and B‐cell phenotype were significant factors for longer survival time in MD with LGIL. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: Lymphomas in MDs involved gastrointestinal lesions at higher frequency compared to other dog breeds examined. B‐cell lymphoma was more common in early‐onset LGIL in MD and cases that involved Mott cell differentiation were observed. Awareness of this specific presentation of lymphoma in dogs will possibly affect the treatment decision process for the owners of MD with LGIL.  aPublisher supplied data 3aB-cell lymphoma 3aB-lymphocytes 3aJapan 3acell differentiation 3adogs 3agastrointestinal system 3ahistopathology 3alife tables 3aobservational studies 3aphenotype 3aregression analysis 3aveterinary medicine1 aHirabayashi, Miyuki1 aTanaka, Aki0 tJournal of veterinary internal medicine.g2022 July, v. 36, no. 4 p.1390-1397dJohn Wiley & Sons, Inc.wJournal:jnl43440x0891-66407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jvim.164553Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02822naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002200155245011700177500001400294520153300308592002801841650002601869650001601895650002301911650001801934651001501952653004701967653002702014653001602041653001602057700002902073700002902102700002402131700002202155700002702177700002202204773009902226856009002325852000902415655001202424IND60727493620221121023311.0210311e20210415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072749362DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aquaculture.2021.7364862doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTrần, Nhương,10aGrowth, yield and profitability of genetically improved farmed tilapia (GIFT) and non-GIFT strains in Bangladesh  aNAL-light  aOn-farm performance of the genetically improved farmed tilapia (GIFT) strain in monoculture and polyculture ponds in Bangladesh was assessed using a stratified random sample of 213 GIFT and 256 non-GIFT farmers. The GIFT strain of Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) was mostly farmed by small-scale farmers operating less than one ha of ponds and with a lower assets index than their non-GIFT counterparts. The GIFT strain had a faster growth rate (27% and 36% faster than that of non-GIFT tilapia in monoculture and polyculture, respectively). Although GIFT and non-GIFT farmers applied different stocking strategies with GIFT farmers growing much smaller fingerlings compared to non-GIFT farmers (7.3 g for GIFT and 17.2 g for non-GIFT, and 9.1 g for GIFT and 20.3 g for non-GIFT in monoculture and polyculture, respectively. Yields were statistically different between both strains in monoculture and polyculture (8.1 tons/ha per cycle for GIFT and 6.2 tons/ha per cycle for non-GIFT in monoculture, and 9.3 tons/ha per cycle for GIFT and 7.8 tons/ha per cycle for non-GIFT in polyculture). In polyculture systems, overall polyculture yield was statistically different at the 10% level (12.7 and 10.2 tons/ha for GIFT and non-GIFT ponds). In terms of profitability performance, GIFT tilapia is more profitable and cost-effective than non-GIFT. Findings from this study highlight the importance of adopting culture of high-performance strains to close yield gaps and realize the potential benefits of the GIFT strain.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOreochromis niloticus 3aaquaculture 3acost effectiveness 3aprofitability 3aBangladesh 0aGenetically improved farmed tilapia (GIFT) 0aPerformance assessment 0aMonoculture 0aPolyculture1 aShikuku, Kelvin Mashisia1 aRossignoli, Cristiano M.1 aBarman, Benoy Kumar1 aCheong, Kai Ching1 aAli, Mohammad Shawquat1 aBenzie, John A.H.0 tAquaculture.g2021 Apr. 15, v. 536 p.736486-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl59663x0044-84867nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaculture.2021.7364863Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02916naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001500148245016600163520133100329592002801660650001301688650001701701650001601718650001301734650001601747650001101763650001801774650001101792650001601803650001401819650002201833650001701855650001401872650001801886650001001904650003501914653001401949653001601963653002901979653002602008700005702034700002602091700006502117700005302182773009502235856008302330852000902413655001202422IND60788719820221118175314.0220921e202210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078871982DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fbio.2022.1019602doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Shuhan10aAnti-adhesion capacities of selected cranberry polyphenols and metabolites against P-type and Type-1 fimbriated uropathogenic E. coli using a fluorometric method  aAdhesion of P-type and type-1 fimbriated uropathogenic E. coli (UPEC) to uroepithelial cells initiates urinary tract infections (UTIs). This research aimed to evaluate the capacities of selected cranberry polyphenols and their microbial metabolites to inhibit such adhesion in vitro using a modified fluorometric method. Data showed that the inhibition capacity of myricetin increased with concentration and plateaued at 70%. It had IC₅₀ values of 13.2 μM against P-type E. coli and 5.50 μM against type-1 E. coli. Quercetin showed similar anti-adhesion capacities to myricetin. Procyanidin A2 and B2 had weaker anti-adhesion activities than myricetin and quercetin, with maximal inhibition capacities of 20%–30% against UPEC. Hippuric acid, a major metabolite of cranberry polyphenols in human urine, showed a maximal inhibition of 20% at 558 μM against type-1 E. coli adhesion, whereas no anti-adhesion activity against P-type E. coli was detected. The fractions of cranberry fruit powder enriched with proanthocyanidin polymers showed the highest anti-adhesion activities compared to the fractions enriched with anthocyanins, flavonols, or proanthocyanidin oligomers. Overall, the anti-adhesion activities of cranberry polyphenols and metabolites depend on their structures and the types of fimbriae on E. coli.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadhesion 3aanthocyanins 3acranberries 3afimbriae 3afluorometry 3afruits 3ahippuric acid 3ahumans 3ametabolites 3amyricetin 3aproanthocyanidins 3aprocyanidins 3aquercetin 3aurinary tract 3aurine 3auropathogenic Escherichia coli 0aCranberry 0aPolyphenols 0aUrinary tract infections 0aUropathogenic E. coli1 aZhao, Shaomin1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5987-60481 aChristman, Lindsey M.1 aWashington, Taylor L.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5543-67821 aGu, Liwei1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7807-46300 tFood bioscience.g2022 Oct., v. 49 p.101960-dElsevier LtdwJournal:21610x2212-42927nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fbio.2022.1019603Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03148naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001900153245008900172520192300261592002802184650001602212650001902228650001102247650001202258650001502270650001302285650001502298653001602313653001002329653001202339653000902351653001302360653000902373653000902382653000902391653000802400653001402408700001802422700002402440700002002464773012102484856008802605852000902693655001202702IND60766304420221121064108.0220307e202204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076630442DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envexpbot.2022.1048132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBahmani, Ramin10aCadmium enhances root hair elongation through reactive oxygen species in Arabidopsis  aWe previously reported that Arabidopsis shows enhanced root hair density and length in response to cadmium (Cd). To understand how Cd stimulates root hair elongation, we examined the role of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and root hair elongation-related genes in root hair elongation/tip growth. In response to Cd, Arabidopsis displayed enhanced length and ROS levels in the root hairs, indicating ROS involvement. Furthermore, in response to Cd, ROS generation mutants, including root hair defective 2 (rhd2/rbohc), rbohh, rbohj, per1, per44 and per73, which have shorter root hairs because of impaired ROS generation, also showed increased root hair length and ROS levels, suggesting the involvement of these genes in ROS production in Cd-induced root hair elongation. Supporting the participation of ROS, N-acetyl-L-cysteine (ROS scavenger) treatment reduced root hair elongation and ROS levels. Additionally, the expression of proline-rich extension-like receptor kinase (PERK)5, PERK8, and root hair-specific 10 (RHS10), which are negative regulators of root hair elongation, was reduced by Cd and ROS (H₂O₂). Furthermore, the expression of expansin A7 (EXPA7) and expansin A18 (EXPA18), which are involved in root hair elongation, was remarkably induced by Cd and H₂O₂ in elongating root hairs and tips. Additionally, COBL9, which is involved in cell wall formation, was highly expressed in root hairs and tips in response to Cd and H₂O₂. Furthermore, changes in auxin and ethylene levels showed a similar pattern to that of root hair elongation and ROS at various concentrations of Cd, suggesting the involvement of auxin and ethylene in Cd/ROS-induced root hair elongation. Combined, it appears that Cd enhances root hair elongation/tip growth by elevating the expression of EXPA7, EXPA18 and COBL9 and by inhibiting the expression of PERK5, PERK8, and RHS10, which are ROS-mediated in Arabidopsis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArabidopsis 3aacetylcysteine 3aauxins 3acadmium 3acell walls 3aethylene 3aroot hairs 0aArabidopsis 0aAuxin 0aCadmium 0aCOBL 0aEthylene 0aEXPA 0aPERK 0aRBOH 0aROS 0aRoot hair1 aKim, DongGwan1 aModareszadeh, Mahsa1 aHwang, Seongbin0 tEnvironmental and experimental botany.g2022 Apr., v. 196 p.104813-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl7512x0098-84727nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envexpbot.2022.1048133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle05120naa a2200841 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001600155245025100171520247700422592002802899650001802927650002102945650003002966650002802996650002003024650002603044650002603070650001903096650001303115650002303128650002003151650002003171650001603191650001203207650001703219650001403236650002003250650001003270650001203280650002303292650004203315650001203357650002003369650002103389650002103410650001903431650001803450650003003468650001503498650001403513650001303527650001003540650001803550650001503568650002503583650002203608650002503630650002503655650001803680650003803698650002703736650001603763650001603779653006703795653004803862653001303910653002603923700001803949700001603967700001603983700001603999700001804015700001704033700001804050773009904068856009004167852000904257655001204266IND60688224920221118134851.0200601e20200715xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068822492DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aquaculture.2020.7353092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYe, Guanlin10aLow-gossypol cottonseed protein concentrate used as a replacement of fish meal for juvenile hybrid grouper (Epinephelus fuscoguttatus ♀ × Epinephelus lanceolatus ♂): Effects on growth performance, immune responses and intestinal microbiota  aThe use of low-gossypol cottonseed protein concentrate (CPC) as a replacement for fishmeal (FM) in the juvenile hybrid grouper (Epinephelus fuscoguttatus ♀ × Epinephelus lanceolatus ♂) was investigated concerning differences in growth performance, immune response, and intestinal microbiota among the dietary treatments. Hybrid grouper were fed a diet (isonitrogenous and isolipidic) with FM or FM replaced with either 20% (CPC20), 40% (CPC40) or 60% CPC (CPC60) for 10 weeks. At the end of the study, there were no significant differences in the weight gain rate, specific growth rate, survival rate, and feed intake of fish among the groups. However, the feed conversion ratio of fish in the CPC-containing groups was higher than that in the FM group and was significantly higher in the CPC40 and CPC60 group. The levels of immunity-related enzyme activities and gene expression in the fish intestine were also investigated. In the CPC-containing groups, the lysozyme activity and immunoglobulin M levels were significantly increased, while the superoxide dismutase and catalase activities were significantly reduced compared to the FM group. The mRNA expression of innate immune genes (MHC-II-β, TLR22, TNF-α1, IL-6, IFN-γ, and IL-10) of the distal intestine (DI) was significantly increased in CPC-fed fish; however, there was no significant change in the TGF-β1 expression. The bacterial community in the DI was analyzed by Next-Generation Sequencing, which showed no significant difference in alpha diversity among the four diet groups. At the family level, the relative abundance of Burkholderiaceae was significantly higher in the CPC20 group compared to the FM group, while the relative abundance of Bacteroidales S24–7 group and Lachnospiraceae was significantly higher in the FM group. The functional prediction of the microbiota indicated that the pathways of amino acid metabolism, xenobiotics biodegradation and metabolism were significantly more abundant in the CPC-containing groups than the FM group. In contrast, the pathways associated with genetic information processing (translation, replication and repair) were more prevalent in the FM group. These results demonstrated that although dietary CPC replacement of levels up to 60% did not significantly alter the growth performance in hybrid grouper, the immune responses were adversely influenced. Replacing FM with CPC had an important impact on microbial profiles but not on diversity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacteroidales 3aBurkholderiaceae 3aEpinephelus fuscoguttatus 3aEpinephelus lanceolatus 3aLachnospiraceae 3aamino acid metabolism 3abacterial communities 3abiodegradation 3acatalase 3acottonseed protein 3aenzyme activity 3afeed conversion 3afeed intake 3afemales 3afish feeding 3afish meal 3agene expression 3agenes 3agrouper 3agrowth performance 3ahigh-throughput nucleotide sequencing 3ahybrids 3aimmune response 3aimmunoglobulin M 3ainterferon-gamma 3ainterleukin-10 3ainterleukin-6 3aintestinal microorganisms 3aintestines 3ajuveniles 3alysozyme 3amales 3amessenger RNA 3aprediction 3aprotein concentrates 3aspecies diversity 3aspecific growth rate 3asuperoxide dismutase 3asurvival rate 3atransforming growth factor beta 1 3atranslation (genetics) 3aweight gain 3axenobiotics 0aEpinephelus fuscoguttatus ♀ × Epinephelus lanceolatus ♂ 0aLow-gossypol cottonseed protein concentrate 0aImmunity 0aIntestinal microbiota1 aDong, Xiaohui1 aYang, Qihui1 aChi, Shuyan1 aLiu, Hongyu1 aZhang, Haitao1 aTan, Beiping1 aZhang, Shuang0 tAquaculture.g2020 July 15, v. 524 p.735309-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl59663x0044-84867nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaculture.2020.7353093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02559naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100005600152245010800208520126800316592002801584650002501612650001801637650002601655650001501681650002801696650002101724650002601745650001501771650002301786650002801809650001501837653002101852653002501873653001901898653002301917700001401940773011101954856008702065852000902152655001202161IND60766304520221121064125.0220509e202205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076630452DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jaridenv.2022.1047272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aİleri, Onur1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0728-473110aMonitoring the available forage using Sentinel 2-derived NDVI data for sustainable rangeland management  aManagement problems could cause rangeland degradation worldwide. Monitoring the seasonal variation of available forage may help to prevent vegetation from deterioration and help to ensure sustainable animal production. Therefore, seasonal variations in the amounts of available forage, and the contents of crude protein (CP), neutral detergent fiber (NDF), acid detergent fiber (ADF), and digestible dry matter (DDM) were monitored for two years via both ground sampling and Sentinel 2A-derived NDVI data at semi-arid Bozdag Rangelands, Turkey. Available forage significantly varied between 374.4 and 936.4 kg ha⁻¹ through the season and all quality parameters showed significant seasonal variations. Available forage was estimated in strong accuracy only in dry season (r² = 0.72, P ≤ 0.01), but the seasonal variations of CP, ADF, and DDM contents were estimated in moderate accuracy (r² = 0.56, 0.40, 0.41 respectively) by the satellite-derived NDVI data. Free Sentinel 2A-derived NDVI values gave promising results for monitoring the forage quality of these semi-arid rangelands, but further research is needed to develop new vegetation indexes for considering woody tissues in vegetation, and higher resolution for greater monitoring accuracy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacid detergent fiber 3acrude protein 3adigestible dry matter 3adry season 3aneutral detergent fiber 3arange management 3arangeland degradation 3arangelands 3aseasonal variation 3asustainable agriculture 3avegetation 0aAvailable forage 0aRangeland monitoring 0aRemote sensing 0aSeasonal variation1 aKoc, Ali,0 tJournal of arid environments.g2022 May, v. 200 p.104727-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl11719x0140-19637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jaridenv.2022.1047273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03071naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100001600137245018500153300001600338520141600354592002801770650002501798650002501823650002401848650002901872650003101901650002601932650003201958650002401990650003602014650002702050650001202077650002002089650001002109650001302119650001502132650001002147650001202157650001202169651002002181651002502201653001202226653001002238653003902248700001502287700001602302700001902318700002102337700001902358773009302377856003802470852000902508655001202517IND50061994720221118033014.0130321s2012    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006199472DNAL7 a10.1071/CP121212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPeck, D.

The red-leaf symptoms resembled those caused by several clover-infecting viruses. A set of molecular diagnostic tools were developed for the following viruses which are known to infect subterranean clover: Alfalfa mosaic virus; Bean leafroll virus (BLRV); Beet western yellows virus; Bean yellow mosaic virus; Cucumber mosaic virus; Pea seed-borne mosaic virus; Soybean dwarf virus and Subterranean clover stunt virus. Surveys of subterranean clover seed production fields in 2008 in the south-east of South Australia and western Victoria identified Bean leafroll virus, Alfalfa mosaic virus and Cucumber mosaic virus as present, with BLRV the most widespread. Surveys of pasture seed production fields and pasture evaluation trials in 2009 confirmed that BLRV was widespread. This result will allow seed producers to determine whether control measures directed against BLRV will overcome their seed losses. Bluegreen aphid (Acyrthosiphon kondoi) was implicated as a potential vector of BLRV because it was observed to be colonising lucerne plants adjacent to subterranean clover seed production paddocks with BLRV, and in a glasshouse trial it transmitted BLRV from an infected lucerne plant to subterranean clover in a persistent manner.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcyrthosiphon kondoi 3aAlfalfa mosaic virus 3aBean leafroll virus 3aBean yellow mosaic virus 3aBeet western yellows virus 3aCucumber mosaic virus 3aPea seed-borne mosaic virus 3aSoybean dwarf virus 3aSubterranean clover stunt virus 3aTrifolium subterraneum 3aalfalfa 3acontrol methods 3acrops 3apastures 3aseed yield 3aseeds 3asurveys 3aviruses 3aSouth Australia 3aVictoria (Australia) 0apasture 0apulse 0asubterranean clover red-leaf virus1 aHabili, N.1 aNair, R.

Its features were designed to minimize the demand for externally supplied electron donor by minimizing net biomass synthesis and oxygen respiration. Over a two-year period, complete denitrification was realized routinely in the VBBR. The nitrate-removal rate was proportion to the influent COD/N ratio, with complete denitrification possible for COD/N ratios >3 gCOD/gN. Batch kinetic tests carried out at the end of years 1 and 2 documented that supplied electron donor was oxidized in the first 1–2 h, but nitrate and nitrite reductions occurred predominantly after 2 h and were driven by internally stored electron donor. Measurements confirmed that the VBBR minimized the demand of added electron donor: The observed yield was only 0.05 mgVSS/mgCOD, and the COD demand for O₂ respiration was only 1–6.7% of the COD demand for N reductions. Biofilm samples taken from the upper and lower ports in cylinder of VBBR had similarly high alpha diversity and dominant genera, but the upper biofilm had a denitrification rate about 70% greater than the lower biofilm. The higher denitrification rate in the upper biofilm correlated its higher content of active biomass.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiofilm 3abiomass 3abioreactors 3adenitrification 3anitrates 3anitrites 3aoxygen 3aresearch 3aspecies diversity 0aBioreactor 0aDenitrification 0aBiofilm 0aElectron donor1 aZeng, Qiuyu1 aZhu, Ge1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8595-13631 aNing, Yanning1 aZhu, Xiaohui1 aZhang, Peipei1 aYan, Ning1 aZhang, Yongming1 aRittmann, Bruce E.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3678-149X0 tEnvironmental research.g2021 June, v. 197 p.111046-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12442x0013-93517nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2021.1110463Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02817naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001800155245011100173500001400284520149500298592002801793650001301821650000801834650001401842650002301856650001501879650003001894650001301924650002201937653003601959653002701995653002202022700001802044700001202062700001202074700001702086700001902103700002002122700001702142700001402159773009902173856009002272852000902362655001202371IND60727493920221121023323.0210311e20210415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072749392DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aquaculture.2021.7364892doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Pingping13aAn efficient integrated approach for nonlethal DNA sampling and genome-wide genotyping in bivalve molluscs  aNAL-light  aGenomic selection (GS) currently represents the hot research area in aquaculture, but implementing GS in some aquatic animals is still hampered by the lacking of efficient nonlethal DNA sampling approach for genome-wide genotyping. This is particularly challenging for bivalve molluscs as they generally have small body size and are vulnerable to mass-tissue sampling methods. Here we describe an integrated approach for rapid, cost-effective nonlethal gill DNA sampling and genome-scale genotyping in scallop. The nonlethal DNA sampling procedure can be finished within 20 min and bypass many tedious and time-consuming steps in the traditional phenol-chloroform method and without using any commercial kit. Experimental optimization of nonlethal gill DNA sampling for genome-wide genotyping was achieved by taking advantage of orthogonal array testing for conquering the complexity of factor combinations. Based on the orthogonal array testing and preferred reduction of gill usage, the best configuration of tissue lysis for direct DNA use without any purification steps was determined, and its superior genotyping performance and high reproducibility were validated by using the high-throughput, cost-efficient 2b-RAD sequencing. We also demonstrated the great applicability of our method on other bivalves. Taken together, our study provides a highly efficient integrated approach of nonlethal DNA sampling and genome-wide genotyping for implementation of GS in shellfish aquaculture.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBivalvia 3aDNA 3abody size 3acost effectiveness 3agenotyping 3amarker-assisted selection 3ascallops 3ashellfish culture 0aBivalve, nonlethal DNA sampling 0aGenome-wide genotyping 0aGenomic selection1 aZhang, Tianqi1 aLv, Jia1 aMa, Cen1 aYang, Zhihui1 aHuang, Xiaowen1 aZhang, Lingling1 aBao, Zhenmin1 aWang, Shi0 tAquaculture.g2021 Apr. 15, v. 536 p.736489-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl59663x0044-84867nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaculture.2021.7364893Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01530naa a2200241 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100002300112245005800135300001600193520085000209592002801059650000801087650001401095650001001109650001001119650001501129773012301144852000901267655001201276IND60331800520221122012747.0150727e20150508xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6033180052DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPennisi, Elizabeth10aNew database links regulatory DNA to its target genes  ap. 618-619.  aScientists have known for years that the genome is riddled with sequences that control gene activity and is not just made up of genes. This extra layer of complexity has hampered searches for the genetic basis of diseases and for drugs that would target just the DNA at fault. In the past few months, however, several major research consortia have delivered what amount to users' manuals for the genome, mapping the locations of thousands of those switches, the specific genes they control, and where in the body they are turned on or off. The latest and arguably boldest of these big biology efforts has now analyzed genetic material gleaned from more than 100 people who had died just hours before. Together with three other projects, the Genotype-Tissue Expression project provides some hope that this complexity can eventually be understood.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3adatabases 3adrugs 3agenes 3ascientists0 tScience.g2015 May 8, v. 348, no. 6235 p.618-619dAmerican Association for the Advancement of Sciencex0036-80757nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle02488naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001300140245014500153300001800298520110500316592002801421650001401449650002301463650002601486650003401512650002101546650001501567650001701582650001001599650002401609650000901633650001101642650001101653650001501664650002401679700001901703700001601722700001801738700001501756700001901771700001601790773014101806856007401947852000902021655001202030IND60685086620221119164620.0200227e20200225xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068508662DNAL7 a10.1039/c9ta13583a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLin, Can10aConstruction of an iron and oxygen co-doped nickel phosphide based on MOF derivatives for highly efficient and long-enduring water splitting  ap. 4570-4578.  aThe exploitation of high catalytic activity electrocatalysts with abundant earth reserves is the prerequisite for extensive hydrogen production from water electrolysis. Herein, based on a feasible design idea, we fabricate an iron and oxygen co-doped nickel phosphide ((Fe₀.₁Ni₀.₉)₂P(O)) by phosphating metal–organic framework (MOF) derivatives supported on nickel foam (NF) for efficient water splitting. In 1.0 M KOH, the (Fe₀.₁Ni₀.₉)₂P(O)/NF electrode only requires an overpotential of 240 mV to reach 100 mA cm⁻² for the OER and 87 mV to reach 10 mA cm⁻² for the HER, respectively. Encouragingly, an alkaline electrolyzer assembled with the (Fe₀.₁Ni₀.₉)₂P(O)/NF electrode can achieve a current density of 10 mA cm⁻² at an extremely low voltage of 1.50 V, which is one of the lowest values currently achievable with non-precious metal electrocatalysts. Undoubtedly, this work provides a novel and practical strategy to synthesize highly efficient and durable electrocatalysts based on MOF derivatives for overall water splitting and other electrocatalysis.  aPublisher supplied data 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3acoordination polymers 3aelectric potential difference 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3aelectrolysis 3afoams 3ahydrogen production 3airon 3anickel 3aoxygen 3aphosphides 3apotassium hydroxide1 aWang, Dingqian1 aJin, Huihui1 aWang, Pengyan1 aChen, Ding1 aLiu, Bingshuai1 aMu, Shichun0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2020 Feb. 25, v. 8, no. 8 p.4570-4578dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c9ta13583a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03468naa a2200781 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001500152245011000167520154500277592002801822650003501850650001801885650001601903650001901919650002801938650001601966650001301982650001201995650002202007650002602029650002102055650001402076653000702090653000802097653000802105653000802113653001102121653000802132653000802140653000802148653000802156653000902164653000702173653000702180653000702187653001002194653001002204653001402214653001402228653001002242653000702252653000702259653001002266653000802276653000902284653000802293653001002301653001202311653000802323653000902331653000802340653002102348653000902369653002202378700001702400700001702417700001502434700002102449700001802470773009002488856008702578852000902665655001202674IND60746021720221119191532.0210904e202110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074602172DNAL7 a10.1016/j.peptides.2021.1706132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Qian10aGhrelin ameliorates cardiac fibrosis after myocardial infarction by regulating the Nrf2/NADPH/ROS pathway  aTo evaluate the role of ghrelin in cardiac fibrosis after myocardial infarction (MI) and to investigate the underlying mechanisms of ghrelin-regulated Nrf2/NADPH/ROS pathway-mediated cardioprotection, the profile of Nrf2, fibrosis markers, and oxidative stress markers were characterized in a rat model of MI and Angiotensin II (Ang II)-stimulated cardiac fibroblasts (CFs). The effects of ghrelin on cardiac function, fibrosis and oxidative stress were investigated after MI in vivo. The role of ghrelin in CF migration and proliferation was evaluated in Ang II-stimulated CFs in vitro. Inhibition of ghrelin receptors using the antagonist, d-Lys³-GHRP-6, in addition to ghrelin was employed in MI and CFs to investigate the direct effect of ghrelin on cardiac fibrosis. Loss function of Nrf2 in CFs was performed to investigate the effect of ghrelin-regulated Nrf2 on oxidative stress and cardiac fibrosis. Ghrelin improved the post-MI cardiac function and reduced cardiac fibrosis. This phenotype is associated with the upregulation of Nrf2 and downregulation of fibrotic proteins, NADPH oxidase and ROS production. In line with in vivo findings, ghrelin attenuated Ang II-stimulated CF migration, proliferation, and oxidative stress in vitro. Inhibition of the ghrelin receptor or knockdown of Nrf2 abolished the beneficial effects of ghrelin on MI or Ang II-stimulated cardiac fibroblasts. In conclusion, ghrelin ameliorates post-MI and Ang II-induced cardiac fibrosis by activating Nrf2, which in turn inhibits the NADPH/ROS pathway.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNAD(P)H oxidase (H2O2-forming) 3aanimal models 3aantagonists 3acardiac output 3acardioprotective effect 3afibroblasts 3afibrosis 3aghrelin 3aghrelin receptors 3amyocardial infarction 3aoxidative stress 3aphenotype 0aMI 0aCFs 0aECM 0aROS 0aAng II 0aRAS 0aMDA 0aSOD 0aMMP 0aNrf2 0aGH 0aEF 0aFS 0aLVIDd 0aLVIDs 0adp/dt max 0adp/dt min 0aLVEDP 0aLV 0aNC 0aCoCl2 0aPMA 0aPMNs 0aLAD 0aCCK-8 0aDCFH-DA 0aDCF 0aCTGF 0aGSH 0aCardiac fibrosis 0aNrf2 0aNADPH/ROS pathway1 aLiu, Ai-dong1 aLi, Tian-shu1 aTang, Qian1 aWang, Xian-cheng1 aChen, Xue-bin0 tPeptides.g2021 Oct., v. 144 p.170613-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11832x0196-97817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.peptides.2021.1706133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02398naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002400151245009900175300001600274520117400290592002801464650001501492650002801507650002601535650002601561650001401587650002201601650002001623650001601643650001101659650001801670651001101688653001001699653002001709653000901729653001101738700002401749700002601773773008301799856008501882852000901967655001201976IND60568298520221121061253.0170504e20170704xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056829852DNAL7 a10.1080/00173134.2016.12402292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCoelho, Carolina B.10aFern spore fall in the ‘Parque Estadual das Fontes do Ipiranga (PEFI)’, São Paulo, Brazil  ap. 273-284.  aStudies related to spore production and dispersal are scarce but extremely important, as they allow colonisation of new sites and gene flow among different populations.

The method included introducing Lycopodium clavatum tablets, adding hydrofluoric acid and sulphuric acid, and finally adopting the acetolysis method. A total of 17 types of spores were identified. The canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) did not demonstrate regular patterns of dispersal for each site. Wind influences the spore dispersal process minimally, but there was no significant association between dispersal and the remaining environmental variables. Spores of species uncommon to the area were recorded, perhaps contributing to the colonisation of new areas and helping to understand studies on regeneration and recomposition of ferns and lycophytes in areas undergone anthropic impacts.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLycopodium 3acorrespondence analysis 3aenvironmental factors 3aferns and fern allies 3agene flow 3ahydrofluoric acid 3aspore dispersal 3aspore traps 3aspores 3asulfuric acid 3aBrazil 0aferns 0afern spore fall 0aPEFI 0aBrazil1 aEsteves, Luciano M.1 ada Luz, Cynthia F.

Herein, an AgPF₆–LiNO₃ hybrid electrolyte additive was introduced into a carbonate electrolyte, which was found to induce the formation of a homogeneous dense layer of Ag–Li alloy seeds with small sizes on the Li metal surface. The formation mechanism of such fine Ag–Li alloy seeds on the Li metal substrate was evaluated, which revealed an interesting synergistic effect between AgPF₆ and LiNO₃. The occurrence of such a dense layer of Ag–Li alloy seeds was found to play a significant positive role in homogeneous nucleation and growth of Li dendrites, and LiNO₃ could inhibit the growth of Li and act as a grain refiner during a repetitive plating/stripping process, thus enabling profoundly improved structural stability and excellent long-term cycle performance for the Li anode during the cycling process. With the co-presence of AgPF₆–LiNO₃ in the electrolyte, the relevant symmetric cells could work steadily for 3000 h with slight polarization at a density of 0.5 mA cm⁻²; and the Li–graphite battery can exhibit good cycle performances and deliver a specific energy density of 374 W h kg⁻¹ at a power density of 747 W kg⁻¹.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalloys 3aanodes 3abatteries 3acarbonates 3aelectrolytes 3alithium 3asilver 3aspecific energy 3asynergism1 aPeng, Jun1 aHan, Fa-Ming1 aSun, Ya-Ke1 aSheng, Tian1 aLi, Yang-Yang1 aZhou, Yao1 aHuang, Ling1 aLi, Jun-Tao1 aSun, S.-G.q(Shi-Gang),0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2020 Feb. 25, v. 8, no. 8 p.4300-4307dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c9ta13644d3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03092naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245011000169300001600279520197200295592002802267650002302295650001802318650001502336650001302351650001302364650001802377650001602395651001202411653001502423653002402438653002302462653002302485700001902508773013102527856005102658852000902709655001202718IND50086616220221116175542.0140412e20120401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008661622DNAL7 a10.1080/1389224X.2012.6559652doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFarrell, Maura14aThe Importance of Evaluation – The Case of the ‘The Options for Farm Families Programme’ in Ireland  ap. 105-120.  aPurpose: The article explores the significance of ‘evaluation’ in the delivery of multifunctional extension advisory programmes and argues the necessity of integrating evaluation into programme planning, to ensure that programme guidelines are adhered to and extension advisory programmes generate their desired impact. The article focuses on the Irish Extension Advisory Service (Teagasc) as they implement major programme restructuring mechanisms to meet the challenges in the Irish agricultural community.Design/methodology/approach: One extension programme indicative of this restructuring is ‘The Options for Farm Families Programme’. This programme embraces a multifunctional approach whereby extension advisers transfer relevant knowledge and advice to ‘farm families’ about future ‘options’. While the programme displays vision and forward thinking, on evaluation (using Bennett's Hierarchy as a methodological evaluation process), significant failings in the programme's implementation were discovered.Findings: The evaluation carried out on the Options Programme discovered that the process and guidelines of the programme were not adhered to, resulting in the programme having little or no impact on the programme participants.Practical implications: The practical implication of this evaluation research was the provision of feedback to Teagasc which resulted in the implementation of programme changes, many of which come into effect in the coming months.Originality/value: The added value lies in the notion that not only is evaluation an integral part of any successful extension programme development but there is also a need to ‘embrace error’ which allows for individual and collective learning. Few studies, particularly in an Irish context, have sought to evaluate multifunctional extension programmes, despite the evidence that the intervention of such professionals has greatly influenced the behaviour of many farm families.  aPublisher supplied data 3aextension programs 3afarm families 3aguidelines 3alearning 3aplanning 3aprofessionals 3avalue added 3aIreland 0aEvaluation 0aBennett's Hierarchy 0aExtension Advisory 0aMultifunctionality1 aMcDonagh, John0 tjournal of agricultural education and extension.g2012 Apr. 1, v. 18, no. 2 p.105-120dTaylor & Francis Groupx1750-86227nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/1389224X.2012.655965  aDNAL 7aarticle03812naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094024003900136024004600175040001800221100002100239245012700260300001400387506002800401506003600429506007600465506003100541520194400572592002802516596004502544596008702589506003702676650002402713650001102737650001202748650002102760650001202781650001702793650002002810650001002830650002002840650001502860651001802875653001602893653001002909653001602919653001502935653001502950700002102965700002202986773010603008856008603114903002403200961001303224852000903237655001203246IND60525292720221207075724.0190318e201601  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052529272DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aquaeng.2015.12.0022chorus7 a10.1016/j.aquaeng.2015.12.0022doi7 a10.1016/j.aquaeng.2015.12.0022chorusOpen  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrown, Travis W.10aPerformance evaluation of four different methods for circulating water in commercial-scale, split-pond aquaculture systems  ap. 33-41.  aResource is Open Access  aElsevier BV License Information  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCHORUS License Information  aSplit-pond aquaculture systems are being implemented by United States (US) catfish farmers as a way to improve production performance. The split-pond consists of a fish-culture basin that is connected to a waste-treatment lagoon by two water conveyance structures. Water is circulated between the two basins with high-volume pumps (water circulators) and many different units are being used on commercial farms. In this study circulator performance was evaluated with four different circulating systems. Rotational speeds ranged from 0.5 to 3.5rpm for a twin, slow rotating paddlewheel; 12.5 to 56.5rpm for a paddlewheel aerator; 60 to 240rpm for a high-speed screw pump; and 150 to 600rpm for an axial-flow pump. Water flow rates ranged from 8.6 to 77.6m3/min and increased with increasing rotational speed. Power input varied directly with flow rate and ranged from 0.24 to 13.43kW for all four circulators. Water discharge per unit power input (i.e., efficiency) ranged from 3.5 to 70.9m3min−1kW−1 for the circulators tested. In general, efficiency decreased as water flow rate increased. Initial investment cost for each circulator and complete circulating system ranged from US $5850 to $22,900, and $15,335 to $78,660, respectively. The least expensive circulator to operate was the twin, slow-rotating paddlewheel, followed by the paddlewheel aerator, high-speed screw pump, and axial-flow pump. Our results show that four different circulating systems can be effectively installed and used to circulate water in split-ponds. However, water flow rate, rotational speed, required power input, efficiency, initial investment cost, and operational expense varied greatly among the systems tested. Long term studies are underway to better define the relationship between water flow rate and fish production in split-ponds. That information will help identify the water circulating system most appropriate for split-pond aquaculture.  aPublisher supplied data  cUSDAdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100000199  cUSDA-NIFA Southern Regional Aquaculture Centerdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/1000058250 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aaquaculture systems 3abasins 3acatfish 3acommercial farms 3afarmers 3afish culture 3afish production 3apumps 3awaste treatment 3awater flow 3aUnited States 0aCirculators 0aPumps 0aSplit-ponds 0aWater flow 0aEfficiency1 aTucker, Craig S.1 aRutland, Billy L.0 tAquacultural engineering.g2016 Jan., v. 70 p.33-41dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl33898x0144-86097nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaeng.2015.12.0023Available from publisher's site  aAccepted Manuscript  aUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle03120naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002800152245009600180500001900276520172300295592002802018650001402046650001502060650001302075650001102088650001202099650000902111650002502120650001302145650001402158650000902172650001402181650000702195650001402202650002002216650002602236651001102262653002002273653002502293653001702318653001502335700003102350700002102381700003202402773009602434856008702530852000902617655001202626IND60731302520221120083130.0210624e20210715xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073130252DNAL7 a10.1016/j.geoderma.2021.1150092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLima, Ana Paula Barbosa10aWeathering sequence of soils along a basalt-sandstone toposequence in the Brazilian Cerrado  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aDespite a multitude of studies on fertility and physics of tropical soils, the effect of soil parent material on their genesis, chemical and mineralogical composition is not yet fully understood. Here, we studied a toposequence of four deep, well-developed soils along a basalt-sandstone transition, comprising two Ferralsols and one Luvisol on the summit and midslopes of a basalt plateau, and one Cambisol at a lower sandstone plateau. Basalt soils had high (42–77%) clay contents, and were mostly comprised by gibbsite, Fe oxides, and poorly crystalline kaolinite, whereas the sandstone soil had < 20% clay and kaolinitic clay. The studied Ferralsols were moderately to highly fertile, presented pH values 6.4–7.2 and blocky instead of the common granular structure, contrasting with most gibbsitic Ferralsols in tropical Brazil. The Luvisol showed very high base nutrient contents but lower pH (5.5–6.0), and the sandy Cambisol was also relatively fertile. All soils had no exchangeable Al³⁺, which was also unusual for Cerrado soils, which are mostly very acidic and nutrient-poor. Most likely these unusual features result from the formation of an interstratified clay mineral complex between kaolinite and mica, which occurred as a major phase in the Luvisol and as traces in Ferralsols. Micromorphological analysis showed that celadonite, a green-colored inclusion probably comprised by muscovite/paragonite micas, was a major component of the basalt and the last mineral to weather within the Luvisol. Thus, the toposequence ranged from the less developed, high-activity clay Luvisol to extremely weathered, gibbsitic Ferralsols, with the sandstone Cambisol in an intermediate stage of development.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCambisols 3aFerralsols 3aLuvisols 3abasalt 3acerrado 3aclay 3adevelopmental stages 3agibbsite 3akaolinite 3amica 3amuscovite 3apH 3asandstone 3asandstone soils 3asoil parent materials 3aBrazil 0aSoil mineralogy 0aSoil micromorphology 0aSoil genesis 0aMafic rock1 aInda, Alberto Vasconcellos1 aZinn, Yuri Lopes1 ado Nascimento, Paulo César0 tGeoderma.g2021 July 15, v. 394 p.115009-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl16374x0016-70617nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.geoderma.2021.1150093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03619naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100003100148245012800179300001600307520197300323592002802296650004402324650002102368650001502389650002502404650001302429650001302442650001902455650001502474650001102489650001802500650001302518650002102531650001902552650002002571650001602591650002602607650001702633651001702650653001402667653003602681653000902717653001802726700002202744700002802766700002002794700006102814773012202875856008302997852000903080655001203089IND60746022020221119192006.0211030e202111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074602202DNAL7 a10.1016/j.sajb.2021.07.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTeclegeorgish, Zecarias W.10aNutrients, secondary metabolites and anti-oxidant activity of Moringa oleifera leaves and Moringa-based commercial products  ap. 409-420.  aMoringa oleifera is a multipurpose plant with a wide range of applications. The leaves of M. oleifera (MOLs) collected from Limpopo, Mpumalanga and Gauteng provinces, as well as commercially sold Moringa-based products (MBCPs), were investigated for nutrient content, secondary metabolites profiles and antioxidant activity. Fourier Transform infrared spectroscopy provided a rapid tool for the quality assurance and authentication of MBCPs. Marker bands representing the OH stretch, aromatic group stretch (C = C), sharp absorption band (C = O) and typical aliphatic CH stretch, were observed in the MBCPs. The profiling of the methanol extract using UPLC-Q-TOF-MS revealed 19 compounds namely; flavonoids and phenolic acid derivatives identified as, Glucomoringin (1), 3-Caffeoyl quinic acid (2), 3-p-Coumaroylquinic acid (3), 4-Caffeoyl quinic acid (4), Acetyl 4-(α-l-rhamnopyranosyloxy) benzyl glucosinolate (5), Apigenin C-diglycoside (6), 4-p-Coumaroyl quinic acid (7), 4-Feruloylquinic acid (8), Quercetin-3-O-rutinoside (9), Apigenin C-hexose (10), Quercetin-7-hexose (11), Quercetin-3-hexose (12), Quercetin-3-acetyl-hexose (13), Kaempferol-3-O-rutinoside (14), Luteolin-7-O-glucoside (15), kaempferol-3-hexose (16), Cyanidin hexose (17), Isorhamnetin-hexose (18) and Kaempferol acetyl hexose (19). A strong comparability was observed between antioxidant activity and nutrient content of the leaves. Leaves from Limpopo exhibited the highest nutrient content and lowest IC₅₀ value (19.1 ± 0.26 µg/mL) indicating satisfactory antioxidant activity, followed by leaves harvested from Mpumalanga (22.8 ± 0.60 µg/mL) and Gauteng (24.2 ± 0.21 µg/mL). Geographical location played a limited role in the secondary metabolites profiling of M. oleifera. All the leaf specimens studied contain adequate antioxidants, nutrients and therefore useful in the manufacture of food, body products, drugs and phyto-pharmaceuticals with therapeutic value.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aMoringa oleifera 3aabsorption 3aantioxidant activity 3aapigenin 3acyanidin 3aglucosinolates 3akaempferol 3aleaves 3amanufacturing 3amethanol 3anutrient content 3aphenolic acids 3aquality control 3aquinic acid 3asecondary metabolites 3atherapeutics 3aSouth Africa 0aNutrients 0aSecondary metabolites profiling 0aFTIR 0aUPLC-Q-TOF-MS1 aAphane, Yvonne M.1 aMokgalaka, Ntebogeng S.1 aSteenkamp, Paul1 aTembu, Vuyelwa J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7421-64670 tSouth African journal of botany.g2021 Nov., v. 142 p.409-420dElsevier B.V.aSAABwJournal:jnl34108x0254-62997nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.sajb.2021.07.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03497naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001600140245014200156300001800298520182600316592002802142650003002170650002702200650002002227650001302247650001302260650001302273650002002286650001902306650001902325650001002344650003002354650001102384650000902395650001002404650000902414650001902423650001402442650001502456650001502471650001802486650002102504650001102525650001802536650003702554650001002591650001202601700001502613700001902628700001602647700001802663700001902681773012402700856007402824852000902898655001202907IND60617729820221118005217.0181026e20180221xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061772982DNAL7 a10.1039/c7fo00990a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLin, Feifei10aProbiotic/prebiotic correction for adverse effects of iron fortification on intestinal resistance to Salmonella infection in weaning mice  ap. 1070-1078.  aIron fortification has been associated with a modest increase in diarrhea risk among children.

The 500 ppm-FeSO₄ diet caused a significantly decreased abundance of potentially beneficial Lactobacillus. During infection with the foodborne pathogen Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (S. Typhimurium), mice on the 500 ppm-FeSO₄ diet showed earlier appearance of poisoning symptoms, higher rates of weight and appetite loss, and lower survival rates, all of which were effectively reversed by supplementation with a probiotic (Lactobacillus acidophilus) or a prebiotic (inulin) for 7 days before infection. Iron fortification with 500 ppm ferrous sulfate also increased fecal shedding and spleen and liver load of viable S. Typhimurium, suggesting its promoting effect on pathogen colonization and translocation, and this negative effect was found to be well corrected by supplementation with Lactobacillus acidophilus or inulin. Light and transmission electron microscopic observation on the ileal villus structure revealed the histopathological impairment of the intestine by iron fortification with both 250 ppm and 500 ppm ferrous sulfate, and the intestinal lesions were markedly alleviated by supplementation with Lactobacillus acidophilus or inulin. These results provide experimental evidence for the increased diarrhea risk upon iron fortification with high pathogen load, and demonstrate that probiotic or prebiotic supplementation can be used to eliminate the potential harm of iron fortification on gut health.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLactobacillus acidophilus 3aSalmonella Typhimurium 3aadverse effects 3aappetite 3achildren 3adiarrhea 3aferrous sulfate 3afood pathogens 3ahistopathology 3aileum 3aintestinal microorganisms 3ainulin 3airon 3aliver 3amice 3amicrobial load 3apoisoning 3aprebiotics 3aprobiotics 3asalmonellosis 3aspecies richness 3aspleen 3asurvival rate 3atransmission electron microscopy 3avilli 3aweaning1 aWu, Haohao1 aZeng, Mingyong1 aYu, Guangli1 aDong, Shiyuan1 aYang, Huicheng0 tFood & function.g2018 Feb. 21, v. 9, no. 2 p.1070-1078dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26907x2042-650X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c7fo00990a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03110naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002200151245014300173300001400316520168700330592002802017650002602045650001602071650002702087650001602114650001402130650002002144650001402164650001102178650001102189650002102200650001402221651001902235651001302254653004202267653000802309653002902317653002602346700001702372700001502389700001902404700001602423773010602439856008602545852000902631655001202640IND60525292820221122234100.0190318e201601  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052529282DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aquaeng.2015.12.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFredriksson, D.W.10aDesign approach for a containment barrier system for in-situ setting of Crassostrea virginica for aquaculture and restoration applications  ap. 42-55.  aAs part of an applied research project, an engineering design and structure deployment study was conducted to investigate the feasibility of performing in-situ larval set of Crassostrea virginica within a temporarily deployed containment barrier. The intent of the barrier was to contain free-swimming larvae to maximize set on emplaced shell substrate. The project site was located in the Chesapeake Bay waters of Maryland (USA) in a tidal tributary adjacent to the Patuxent River. The project included a practical ocean engineering approach to specify barrier and mooring system components by investigating environmental design criteria, applying computational fluid dynamic techniques, and characterizing the barrier and mooring leg shape and tension with catenary equations. Following analysis and component specification, both the barrier and mooring system components were deployed. The structure consisted of two, 15m length sections of Type-III turbidity curtain with a skirt depth of 4.57m, but adjustable with furling lines. The structure enclosed an area of about 65m2 with clean oyster shell substrate and was held vertical in the water column with ∼0.3m floats at the surface and chain at the bottom of the skirt. It was deployed with an 8-point spread mooring configuration to maintain its shape in a 0.51m/s current and 0.75m waves. After deployment, larvae were introduced into the enclosed volume and allowed three days to set before removing the barrier. A companion biological field study demonstrated that the technique could add over 180 juvenile oysters/m2 to the site with clean cultch. Recommendations for a potential, scaled-up version are also discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCrassostrea virginica 3aaquaculture 3adesign for environment 3aengineering 3aequations 3afluid mechanics 3ajuveniles 3alarvae 3arivers 3ashell (molluscs) 3aturbidity 3aChesapeake Bay 3aMaryland 0aShellfish aquaculture and restoration 0aCFD 0aAquacultural engineering 0aMooring system design1 aSteppe, C.N.1 aLuznik, L.1 aWallendorf, L.1 aMayer, R.H.0 tAquacultural engineering.g2016 Jan., v. 70 p.42-55dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl33898x0144-86097nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaeng.2015.12.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02431naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001600148245010200164300001800266520096200284592002801246596006301274650001601337650002901353650001801382650001401400650001301414650002701427650001401454650002601468650001501494650001301509650002301522650001301545700001701558700001901575700001601594700001601610700001401626700001501640700002001655700001601675700005601691773011101747856008201858852000901940655001201949IND60685376420221121002908.0200303e202003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068537642DNAL7 a10.1007/s10570-019-02942-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Wenying10aAll-natural injectable hydrogel with self-healing and antibacterial properties for wound dressing  ap. 2637-2650.  aAn ideal wound dressing is highly desired for the repair of chronic wounds which should provide a moist environment, self-healing, antibacterial properties etc. Here, a novel injectable antibacterial chitosan hydrogel with good self-healing and improved mechanical properties has been prepared by dialdehyde bacterial cellulose (DABC) nanofibers as the non-toxic biocrosslinker. It is the first time to prepare the all-natural chitosan hydrogels by using ascorbic acid (VC) as solvent to dissolve chitosan and the natural fiber DABC as reinforcing and crosslinking agent. Then, the disadvantage of the use of acetic acid in the medical field was overcome and the other toxic crosslinking agents were abandoned. Accordingly, this work provides a new strategy towards fabricating the self-healing hydrogel with injectable and antibacterial properties. The new multifunctional hydrogels demonstrate strong potentiality in wound dressings or tissue engineering.  aPublisher supplied data  a51573024cthe National Natural Science Foundation of China 3aacetic acid 3aantibacterial properties 3aascorbic acid 3acellulose 3achitosan 3across-linking reagents 3ahydrogels 3amechanical properties 3ananofibers 3asolvents 3atissue engineering 3atoxicity1 aWang, Baoxiu1 aZhang, Minghao1 aWu, Zuotong1 aWei, Jiaxin1 aJiang, Yu1 aSheng, Nan1 aLiang, Qianqian1 aZhang, Dong1 aChen, Shiyan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4195-30140 tCellulose.g2020 Mar., v. 27, no. 5 p.2637-2650dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl3871471x0969-02397nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10570-019-02942-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03046naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001800153245010100171520165000272592002801922650004401950650001501994650001302009650002302022650002202045650002402067650000702091650001702098650001702115650001602132653002602148653002902174653001302203653001702216653002002233700001502253700001802268700001302286700001802299700001902317700001602336700001502352773011202367856008802479852000902567655001202576IND60766305220221121034543.0220314e202205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076630522DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enzmictec.2022.1100052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Rongzhong10aEfficient immobilization of catalase on mesoporous MIL-101 (Cr) and its catalytic activity assay  aEnzyme immobilization using metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) as carriers has aroused significant interest owing to the unique pore structure and versatile surface functional groups of MOFs. Catalase (CAT) is an important industrial enzyme that is widely used in the catalytic decomposition of hydrogen peroxide in the fields of food and biological products. In this study, mesoporous MIL-101 (Cr), synthesized through a facile hydrothermal process, was applied for CAT immobilization for the first time. The immobilization capacity of MIL-101 (Cr) for CAT was studied systematically by batch adsorption tests under different adsorption conditions, including the variation of the solution pH, operation temperature, adsorption time, and initial concentration of CAT. Based on these test findings, the optimum adsorption conditions and maximum adsorption capacity were determined. The adsorption kinetics were simulated to further explore the adsorption mechanism, and they suggest that chemical adsorption, rather than physical adsorption, is the main CAT adsorption mechanism. A comparison of Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra of MIL-101 (Cr) without and with adsorbed CAT reveals the formation of amide bonding between the -NH of CAT and the uncoordinated -CO of MIL-101(Cr). Finally, the stability and activity of the immobilized CAT were assessed, and an improved insensitivity against changes in pH and a prolonged storage time demonstrate the enhanced stability of immobilized CAT by MIL-101 (Cr) carriers. This study demonstrates the application of MOFs as functional supports for the efficient immobilization of versatile enzymes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aadsorption 3acatalase 3acatalytic activity 3ahydrogen peroxide 3aimmobilized enzymes 3apH 3aporous media 3astorage time 3atemperature 0aEnzyme immobilization 0aMetal-Organic Frameworks 0aCatalase 0aMIL-101 (Cr) 0aEnzyme activity1 aLiu, Shiji1 aZhou, Xiaolin1 aLiu, Han1 aZhou, Hengcao1 aWang, Chunfang1 aLiu, Yufeng1 aZhang, Xia0 tEnzyme and microbial technology.g2022 May, v. 156 p.110005-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12419x0141-02297nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enzmictec.2022.1100053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01683naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100001700112245003100129300001600160520074200176592002800918650001100946650002000957650001000977650001200987650001200999650001001011650001201021650001401033650002801047650001601075650002401091650001301115650001301128650002101141651001501162773012301177852000901300655001201309IND60331800820221121235955.0150727e20150508xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6033180082DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Ingfei10aSaving California's calves  ap. 626-627.  aA devastating cattle disease endemic in California's foothill country causes pregnant heifers to lose their fetuses in the third trimester, killing an estimated 5% to 10% of the state's annual beef calf "crop"—a loss of 45,000 to 90,000 animals. The veterinary drug industry has largely ignored it, concentrating on bigger markets. And researchers have long struggled to find a cause or a cure. But after years of sleuthing, they identified the tick-borne pathogen, which belongs to a class of soil microbes better known for their swarming, gliding behavior than for causing disease. And by stitching together funding and collaborations, the scientists have developed a promising vaccine and are now testing it in thousands of heifers.  aPublisher supplied data 3acalves 3acattle diseases 3afetus 3afunding 3aheifers 3ahills 3amarkets 3apathogens 3apharmaceutical industry 3aresearchers 3asoil microorganisms 3aswarming 3avaccines 3aveterinary drugs 3aCalifornia0 tScience.g2015 May 8, v. 348, no. 6235 p.626-627dAmerican Association for the Advancement of Sciencex0036-80757nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle03665naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006300148245013400211300001800345520135700363592002801720596011101748596002801859596003801887596004301925596004901968650004402017650002602061650003702087650001802124650002902142650002602171650001402197650001002211650002202221650002002243650001902263650001602282650002602298650001402324650004402338650003302382650001602415650001502431700006202446700001702508700006602525700005402591700005502645700005702700700006302757700005302820773011102873856008202984852000903066655001203075IND60685376620221121002718.0200303e202003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068537662DNAL7 a10.1007/s10570-020-02986-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFlores-Rojas, G.

Products exhibited improved mechanical properties, temperature-tunable hydrophilicity, and antimicrobial features. The obtained N6@CE films were grafted with N-vinylcaprolactam (NVCL) using gamma-rays, providing temperature responsiveness in a range of 37–38 °C. The grafting degree was studied as a function of CE percentage on the film, monomer concentration, and absorbed dose. The grafting degree increased with the percentage of CE on the film, and the maximum grafting was achieved at monomer concentration and the irradiation dose of 20% NVCL and 20 kGy, respectively. NVCL grafting was confirmed by SEM, ¹³C-CPMAS NMR, FTIR-ATR, and XPS. SEM images attested formation of nanopores on the structure, caused by the grafting process, that consequently triggering on the new characteristics of the final materials. Potential performance of the composites as wound dressings was investigated in terms of their capability to loading and release of antimicrobial agents, such as vancomycin and benzalkonium chloride. NVCL grafting enhanced the uptake of both drugs, especially benzalkonium chloride, and regulated their release demonstrating antimicrobial effectiveness against Staphylococcus aureus.  aPublisher supplied data  aIN201617cDirección General de Asuntos del Personal Académico, Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México  aSAF2017-83118-RcMINECO  aED431C 2016/008cXunta de Galicia  aAEMAT ED431E 2018/08cXunta de Galicia  a0245_IBEROS_1_EcInterreg V-A POCTEP Program 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aStaphylococcus aureus 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aabsorbed dose 3aantibacterial properties 3abenzalkonium chloride 3acellulose 3adrugs 3afilms (materials) 3agamma radiation 3ahydrophilicity 3airradiation 3amechanical properties 3ananopores 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3ascanning electron microscopy 3atemperature 3avancomycin1 aLópez-Saucedo, F.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2806-06571 aVázquez, E.1 aHernández-Mecinas, E.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8827-73861 aHuerta, L.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5398-62621 aCedillo, G.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5365-732X1 aConcheiro, A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0507-049X1 aAlvarez-Lorenzo, C.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8546-70851 aBucio, E.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4853-125X0 tCellulose.g2020 Mar., v. 27, no. 5 p.2785-2801dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl3871471x0969-02397nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10570-020-02986-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01938naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002600145245016100171300001200332506002800344520072800372592002801100506003701128650001001165650001401175650001601189650001201205651001401217653001601231653001601247653002901263653003101292653001801323700001901341773011501360856008001475852000901555655001201564IND60784511820221207081413.0200428e202002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078451182DNAL7 a10.24815/jn.v20i1.145372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJANRA, MUHAMMAD NAZRI10aSome additional records to the inventory of dragonflies and damselflies (Odonata) in Andalas University’s Limau Manis campus complex, Padang, West Sumatra  ap. 1-5.  aResource is Open Access  aSince the publication of inventory list for dragonflies and damselflies within the boundary of Andalas University’s Limau Manis Campus Complex, Padang, on 2018, the survey efforts have been continuously conducted.

With this addition, Andalas University’s Limau Manis Campus Complex currently resides for 32 species and 9 families of Odonata, increasing from previously 27 species and 8 families.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aManis 3aZygoptera 3ainventories 3asurveys 3aIndonesia 0adamselflies 0adragonflies 0adrepanosticta cf bispina 0aheliocypha angusta angusta 0ah. fenestrata1 aHERWINA, HENRY0 tJurnal Natural (Aceh).g2020 Feb., v. 20, no. 1 p.1-5dUniversitas Syiah KualawJournal:27755x2541-40627nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.24815/jn.v20i1.145373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02410naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245010200166300001300268520137600281592002801657650001201685650001401697650000901711650001401720650002401734650000701758650001301765650001401778650001501792650001301807650000901820700002101829773010801850856008101958852000902039655001202048IND50071829220221122055357.0150211e201401  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007182922DNAL7 a10.1007/s11270-013-1800-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHong, Yongseok10aModeling the Effect of pH and Salinity on Biogeochemical Reactions and Metal Behavior in Sediment  ap. 1800.  aA mathematical model is developed to investigate the effect of pH and salinity fluctuation on biogeochemical reactions and metals' behavior in sediments. The model includes one-dimensional vertical advective and diffusive transport of species, serial reductions of electron acceptors, and precipitation/dissolution of species, acid–base chemistry, and metal sorption to sediments. The model was tested using data obtained from laboratory microcosm experiments which exposed metal (Cd, Zn) contaminated sediment to alternating fresh and salty overlying water. The model successfully reproduces the contrasting metal's release behavior and the vertical profiles of pH, Cl⁻, SO₄²⁻, Mn and Fe in porewater and the acid volatile sulfides (AVS) and simultaneously extracted metals (SEM) in sediments. The model showed that FeOOH₍ₛ₎was the dominant sorption phase controlling the solubility of the metals at the surficial sediments while AVS controlled the solubility of the metals in anoxic sediments. The model also showed that the release of the metals to overlying water was controlled by the oxidation of metal sulfides in a very thin layer of oxic sediments (2–3 mm). The proposed model can be useful in managing metal contaminated sediments where pH and salinity are fluctuating by assessing the underlying biogeochemical processes and metals' behavior.  aPublisher supplied data 3acadmium 3achlorides 3airon 3amanganese 3amathematical models 3apH 3asalinity 3asediments 3asolubility 3asulfides 3azinc1 aReible, Danny D.0 tWater, air, and soil pollution.g2014 Jan., v. 225, no. 1 p.1800-1800dSpringer-Verlagx0049-69797nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11270-013-1800-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03213naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100005400152245011800206500001900324520172000343592002802063650002402091650001202115650001402127650002002141650003002161650001102191650002402202650001302226650002402239650000902263650002502272653001302297653003202310653002002342653001702362653001602379700002602395700002402421700006502445700002202510700001902532773009602551856008702647852000902734655001202743IND60731302820221120083150.0210624e20210715xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073130282DNAL7 a10.1016/j.geoderma.2021.1150382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLu, Yanyan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5213-493810aAssessing the impacts of biochar and fertilizer management strategies on N and P balances in subtropical pastures  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aImproper nutrient management strategies often results in soil N and P imbalances, which can lead to unintended environmental consequences. Nutrient budgets can be useful tools to identify nutrient imports and exports and assess the agronomic and environmental performance of different pasture nutrient management options. In this 3-yr study, we used a farm-gate nutrient budgeting approach to determine N and P use efficiency in subtropical perennial pasture systems subjected to different nutrient management strategies. Treatments consisted of repeated application of biosolids and inorganic fertilizer (at an equivalent rate of 160 kg plant available N ha⁻¹ yr⁻¹) either alone or in combination with (20 Mg ha⁻¹ yr⁻¹). Major N and P inputs and outputs were: N and P added via fertilizer and biochar, plant uptake, leaching, and denitrification (N budget only). Nitrogen recovery in forage above-ground biomass accounted for a significant proportion of applied N (~64%) and P (22%). Greater N leaching occurred in inorganic fertilizer (29% of applied N) vs. biosolids treatments (average of 7% of applied N). Negligible P leaching (0.1–0.2% of total P applied) occurred, regardless of the treatment. Biochar did not affect either crop N and P use efficiency or P leaching, but reduced N leaching for treatments receiving inorganic fertilizer. Treatments showed no impact on soil N, but vertical distribution of soil total P changed over 3 yr, suggesting downward movement of P. Despite the high initial soil test P levels, biosolids application at P loads exceeding agronomic recommendations improved agronomic N and P efficiency relative to control treatments with no impact on N or P leaching.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaboveground biomass 3abiochar 3abiosolids 3adenitrification 3aenvironmental performance 3aforage 3amineral fertilizers 3anitrogen 3anutrient management 3asoil 3aspatial distribution 0aSpodosol 0aPhosphorus saturation ratio 0aNutrient budget 0aGrazinglands 0aSubtropical1 aSilveira, Maria Lucia1 aO'Connor, George A.1 aVendramini, Joao M.B.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3383-16201 aErickson, John E.1 aLi, Yuncong C.0 tGeoderma.g2021 July 15, v. 394 p.115038-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl16374x0016-70617nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.geoderma.2021.1150383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02202naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002400151245010400175300001600279520095900295592002801254650000901282650000901291650001901300651000901319653001301328653000901341653001301350653001701363653000901380700002501389700002701414700001801441700002001459700002101479700002801500700003101528700002301559773010401582856008501686852000901771655001201780IND60568299020221121061257.0170504e20170403xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056829902DNAL7 a10.1080/09397140.2017.12993302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZarrintab, Mohammad10aTaxonomy and distribution of sand boas of the genus Eryx Daudin, 1803 (Serpentes: Erycidae) in Iran  ap. 117-129.  aWe review the distribution, morphology and taxonomic status of Eryx elegans, E. jaculus, E. miliaris , E. tataricus and E. johnii in Iran and examine four metric and 10 meristic characters of 94 specimens from different parts of the country. There are significant morphological differences between Eryx tataricus , E. jaculus and E. elegans , mainly in snout vent length, tail length, and number of ventrals, subcaudals and dorsal scales. Eryx jayakari and E. johnii can easily be distinguished based on their morphological traits and limited distribution in Iran. The occurrence of E. miliaris in Iran was not confirmed. The Iranian populations of Eryx jaculus are assigned to the subspecies E. j. turcicus. E. jaculus specimens from southwestern Iran had higher ventral scales than other populations, so evaluating their taxonomic status needs genetic studies in the future.

The potential of employing amorphous zirconium (Zr) hydroxide to remove phosphate from synthetic wastewater was studied in batch adsorption experiments and in a submerged membrane filtration adsorption hybrid (MFAH) reactor. The adsorption data satisfactorily fitted to Langmuir, pseudo-first order and pseudo-second order models. Langmuir adsorption maxima at 22 °C and pHs of 4.0, 7.1, and 10.0 were 30.40, 18.50, and 19.60 mg P/g, respectively. At pH 7.1 and temperatures of 40 °C and 60 °C, they were 43.80 and 54.60 mg P/g, respectively. The thermodynamic parameters, ΔG° and ΔS° were negative and ΔH° was positive. FTIR, zeta potential and competitive phosphate, sulphate and nitrate adsorption data showed that the mechanism of phosphate adsorption was inner-sphere complexation. In the submerged MFAH reactor experiment, when Zr hydroxide was added at doses of 1–5 g/L once only at the start of the experiment, the removal of phosphate from 3 L of wastewater containing 10 mg P/L declined after 5 h of operation. However, when Zr hydroxide was repeatedly added at 5 g/L dose every 24 h, satisfactory removal of phosphate was maintained for 3 days.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aadsorption 3aeutrophication 3afiltration 3amodels 3anitrates 3apH 3aphosphates 3asulfates 3asurface water 3atemperature 3athermodynamics 3awastewater 3azeta potential 3azirconium 0aPhosphate adsorption 0aZirconium hydroxide 0aMembrane filtration 0aAdsorption thermodynamics 0aAdsorption kinetics1 aPradhan, M.1 aLoganathan, P.1 aKandasamy, J.1 aVigneswaran, S.0 tJournal of environmental management.g2016 Feb. 01, v. 167 p.167-174dElsevier Ltdx0301-47977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2015.11.0483Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02545naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001900144245008300163300001600246500002000262520129900282592002801581650001301609650002301622650001301645650000901658650001001667650001601677650001301693650001301706650001501719650001701734650001101751700001801762700002301780700001801803700001701821700001801838700002001856773014701876856007902023852000902102655001202111IND60587951820180301000000.0180118e201612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058795182DNAL7 a10.1002/jpln.2015006252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGeorge, Jessey10aSmall amounts of ammonium (NH$ _4^+ $) can increase growth of maize (Zea mays)  ap. 717-725.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aNitrate (NO$ _3^ - $) and ammonium (NH$ _4^+ $) are the predominant forms of nitrogen (N) available to plants in agricultural soils. Nitrate concentrations are generally ten times higher than those of NH$ _4^+ $ and this ratio is consistent across a wide range of soil types. The possible contribution of these small concentrations of NH$ _4^+ $ to the overall N budget of crop plants is often overlooked. In this study the importance of this for the growth and nitrogen budget of maize (Zea mays L.) was investigated, using agriculturally relevant concentrations of NH$ _4^+ $. Maize inbred line B73 was grown hydroponically for 30 d at low (0.5 mM) and sufficient (2.5 mM) levels of NO$ _3^ - $. Ammonium was added at 0.05 mM and 0.25 mM to both levels of NO$ _3^ - $. At low NO$ _3^ - $ levels, addition of NH$ _4^+ $ was found to improve the growth of maize plants. This increased plant growth was accompanied by an increase in total N uptake, as well as total phosphorus, sulphur and other micronutrients in the shoot. Ammonium influx was higher than NO$ _3^ - $ influx for all the plants and decreased as the total N in the nutrient medium increased. This study shows that agriculturally relevant proportions of NH$ _4^+ $ supplied in addition to NO$ _3^ - $ can increase growth of maize.  aPublisher supplied data 3aZea mays 3aagricultural soils 3aammonium 3acorn 3acrops 3ahydroponics 3anitrates 3anitrogen 3aphosphorus 3aplant growth 3asulfur1 aHoltham, Luke1 aSabermanesh, Kasra1 aHeuer, Sigrid1 aTester, Mark1 aPlett, Darren1 aGarnett, Trevor0 tZeitschrift für Pflanzenernährung und Bodenkunde.g2016 Dec., v. 179, no. 6 p.717-725dWILEY‐VCH VerlagwJournal:jnl64178x1436-87307nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jpln.2015006253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02308naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002000145245021600165300002000381520104900401592002801450650001601478650001301494650001101507650001901518650002201537650002201559700006101581700002301642700002201665700005901687773013601746856007901882852000901961655001201970IND60718142920221118082747.0201120e20200103xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071814292DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.joc.9b032102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAsada, Takahiro10aAxial Chirality around N–P Bonds Induced by Complexation between E(C₆F₅)₃ (E = B, Al) and an N-Phosphine Oxide-Substituted Imidazolinylidene: A Key Intermediate in the Catalytic Phosphinoylation of CO₂  ap. 14333-14341.  aComplexation-induced axial chirality around an N–P bond occurs upon the predominant coordination of the N-phosphinoyl group in the N-phosphine oxide-substituted imidazolinylidene (SPoxIm) to B(C₆F₅)₃. (Rₐ) and (Sₐ) atropisomers of (κ-O-SPoxIm)B(C₆F₅)₃ were observed independently in the single-crystal lattice and the optimized gas-phase structure. Experimental and theoretical studies confirmed that this axial chirality arises from the restricted rotation around the N–P bond, caused by the steric repulsion between the C5–H atoms of the imidazolinylidene ring and the C₆F₅ rings on the B(C₆F₅)₃ unit. Conversely, this axial chirality was not certainly observed via the complexation between SPoxIm and Al(C₆F₅)₃. The carbene carbon atoms in (κ-O-SPoxIm)E(C₆F₅)₃ (E = B, Al) remain sufficiently nucleophilic to react with CO₂, and the phosphinoylation of CO₂ with SPoxIm proceeds far more rapidly in the presence of a catalytic amount of Al(C₆F₅)₃ than in the absence of Al(C₆F₅)₃.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLewis bases 3acarbenes 3acarbon 3acarbon dioxide 3aoptical isomerism 3aorganic chemistry1 aHoshimoto, Yoichi1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0882-61091 aKawakita, Takahiro1 aKinoshita, Takuya1 aOgoshi, Sensuke1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4188-85550 tJournal of organic chemistry.g2020 Jan. 03, v. 85, no. 22 p.14333-14341dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19181x1520-69047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.joc.9b032103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03696naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100001700166245014100183300002000324520181300344592002802157650002602185650002602211650001702237650002702254650002302281650001502304650001102319650002102330650002602351650001302377650002802390650002302418650002902441650003402470650003502504650003002539650003702569650003302606650002602639650001102665651002302676651001102699700001402710700001602724700001602740700001602756700001602772700002202788700001802810700002102828700001702849773013802866856008103004852000903085655001203094IND60119094220221121050455.0141130e201412  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011909422DNAL7 a245106002pmid7 a10.1007/s11356-014-2574-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFossi, M.

We investigate the interspecific differences in cytochrome P450 1A1 and 2B (CYP1A1 and CYP2B, respectively), aryl hydrocarbon receptor and E2F transcription factor 1 and the contaminants levels [organochlorine compounds, polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs)] in four odontocete species (common bottlenose dolphin, long-beaked common dolphin, sperm whale and killer whale) and three mysticete species (blue whale, fin whale, and Bryde’s whale) using skin biopsy. Differences in contaminant levels and molecular biomarker responses between the odontocete and mysticete species have been pointed out. The canonical discriminant analysis on principal component analysis factors, performed to reveal clustering variables, shows that odontocete are characterised by the highest levels of lipophilic contaminants compared to the mysticete, with the highest levels of polychlorinated biphenyls, dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethanes and PBDEs detected in killer whale and the lowest levels in Bryde’s whale. The biomarker data show interspecific differences amongst the seven species, revealing highest CYP1A and CYP2B protein levels in the mysticete fish-eating species (Bryde’s whale). In conclusion, three main factors seem to regulate the biomarker responses in these species: (a) the inductive ability of persistent organic pollutants and PAHs; (b) the different evolutionary process of the two CYPs related to the different feeding habits of the species; (c) the migratory/resident behaviour of the mysticete species in this area.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBalaenoptera musculus 3aBalaenoptera physalus 3aOrcinus orca 3aPhyseter macrocephalus 3aTursiops truncatus 3abiomarkers 3abiopsy 3acytochrome P-450 3adiscriminant analysis 3adolphins 3ainterspecific variation 3amigratory behavior 3aorganochlorine compounds 3apersistent organic pollutants 3apolybrominated diphenyl ethers 3apolychlorinated biphenyls 3apolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 3aprincipal component analysis 3atranscription factors 3awhales 3aGulf of California 3aMexico1 aPanti, C.1 aMarsili, L.1 aMaltese, S.1 aCoppola, D.1 aJimenez, B.1 aMuñoz-Arnanz, J.1 aFinoia, M.

Aldehydes, aldimines, and ketimines are also viable substrates.

The Brazilian Cerrado is one of the biomes most affected by this setback due to the occupation of areas of economic interest in agriculture. Interestingly, there are projects throughout the biome that aim to encourage the preservation of natural resources, but there is uncertainty about whether these incentives have provided conservation. That is the case of the Feio River hydrographic basin, located in the Cerrado, near the city of Patrocínio, state of Minas Gerais. Indeed, the Feio River watershed has projects incentivizing the Cerrado's conservation. Thus, in this article, we aimed to explain how the advance of agriculture in fragile areas of the Feio river watershed occurs, their causes and whether protection strategies have produced satisfactory results. We used an old Environmental Fragility proposal methodwith our contributions to estimate the variations regarding nature conservation in the basin. Our findings show considerable heterogeneity in the potential fragility of the Feio's river basin. We observe that less fragile sites are used for coffee cultivation (74 and 72% of the two places), while more fragile sites are occupied by reserves (around 50% of the area) and high-impact activities such as traditional monoculture and cattle ranching (25 and 44% for the two sites). Temporally, we observed little change in use and occupation, with a slight increase in no-till farming to replace coffee and conventional cultivation. The permanent preservation areas in the basin have improved vegetation quality, while the reserve areas composed of fields show a degradation process. Considering the importance of the Feio's river basin, different incentives and inspection strategies are needed to guarantee the site's preservation and environmental restoration.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantagonists 3abasins 3acattle 3acerrado 3aecological restoration 3aecosystems 3anatural resources conservation 3ano-tillage 3aoccupations 3arivers 3auncertainty 3awatersheds 3aBrazil1 aBravo, João Vitor M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5457-31920 tJournal of environmental management.g2022 Oct. 01, v. 319 p.115695-dElsevier LtdwJournal:2018x0301-47977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2022.1156953Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02907naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001800144245012600162300001600288500002000304520145200324592002801776650001901804650002501823650001301848650001101861650001301872650001301885650002101898650002201919650002601941650001401967650001601981650001901997650001002016650000902026650001802035650002002053650001002073700002802083700003002111700002802141700002102169773014702190856007902337852000902416655001202425IND60587952020180301000000.0180118e201612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058795202DNAL7 a10.1002/jpln.2016002842doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEpron, Daniel10aUptake of soil mineral nitrogen by Acacia mangium and Eucalyptus urophylla × grandis: No difference in N form preference  ap. 726-732.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe introduction of N₂‐fixing tree species in fast growing tree plantations is a sustainable management option aiming to reduce the risk of nitrogen (N) deficiency due to a large and frequent exportation of nutrients at harvest. Differences in soil mineral N preferences between Eucalyptus urophylla × grandis and Acacia mangium may, in addition to facilitation related to atmospheric N₂ fixation, contribute to the success of mixed‐species plantations of the two species on nutrient‐poor soils of the coastal Congolese plains. We tested whether these two species differ in their preference for nitrate or ammonium by supplying either ammonium or nitrate enriched in ¹⁵N to six‐month‐old potted trees growing in an open‐air nursery. Although the uptake of nitrate tended to be higher than that of ammonium by both species, the difference was not significant and there was no significant difference between the species regarding their preferred form of soil mineral N. Despite much lower N contents in foliage, stems, and roots of eucalypt compared to acacia, the specific rates of N uptake were up to three times higher for eucalypt than acacia, which suggests that atmospheric N₂ was the major source of N in the six‐month‐old acacias. We conclude that N₂ fixation rather than complementarity for soil mineral nitrogen alleviates the competition between species in successful mixed eucalypt and acacia plantations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcacia mangium 3aEucalyptus urophylla 3aammonium 3aleaves 3anitrates 3anitrogen 3anitrogen content 3anitrogen fixation 3anitrogen-fixing trees 3anutrients 3aplantations 3arisk reduction 3aroots 3asoil 3asoil minerals 3astable isotopes 3astems1 aKoutika, Lydie‐Stella1 aTchichelle, Sogni Viviane1 aBouillet, Jean‐Pierre1 aMareschal, Louis0 tZeitschrift für Pflanzenernährung und Bodenkunde.g2016 Dec., v. 179, no. 6 p.726-732dWILEY‐VCH VerlagwJournal:jnl64178x1436-87307nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jpln.2016002843Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03056naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100002400166245013300190300002000323520129300343592002801636650002401664650001201688650001301700650001501713650001401728650001401742650001201756650001001768650001201778650002401790650001901814650002201833650002201855650002201877650001501899650001601914650001701930650001101947650001901958650002101977650002101998650001802019650001502037650001302052650001402065651001002079700003202089700002902121700002702150700002002177700002902197773013802226856008102364852000902445655001202454IND60119094620221121080029.0141130e201412  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011909462DNAL7 a247566662pmid7 a10.1007/s11356-014-2741-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGago-Tinoco, Amanda10aMetabolic signatures associated with environmental pollution by metals in Doñana National Park using P. clarkii as bioindicator  ap. 13315-13323.  aBioindicators can reflect the effects of pollutants on their metabolism, being widely used to assess environmental stress. In this sense, the crab Procambarus clarkii has been previously proposed to monitor the contamination in Doñana National Park (southwest Spain) using conventional biomarkers. In this work, a metabolomic approach based on direct infusion mass spectrometry, which allows an easy and quick study of a large number of metabolites in a single run, was used for pollution assessment of this area, considering the biological response of this organism to contamination. In addition, metal accumulation in crab tissues was determined. Thus, the integrated analysis of metabolomic and metallomic data enabled the study of metabolic response of the organism against pollution. Several metabolites were discovered as potential biomarkers of pollution, such as decreased levels of carnosine, alanine, niacinamide, acetoacetate, pantothenic acid, ascorbate, glucose-6-phosphate, arginine, glucose, lactate, phospholipids, and tryglicerides, as well as elevated levels of acetyl carnitine, phosphocholine, choline, and uric acid. In this way, metal-induced toxicity could be related to metabolic impairments, principally oxidative stress, metabolic dysfunction, and dyslipidemia.  aPublisher supplied data 3aProcambarus clarkii 3aalanine 3aarginine 3abiomarkers 3acarnitine 3acarnosine 3acholine 3acrabs 3aglucose 3aglucose 6-phosphate 3ahyperlipidemia 3aindicator species 3amass spectrometry 3ametabolic studies 3ametabolism 3ametabolites 3ametabolomics 3ametals 3anational parks 3aoxidative stress 3apantothenic acid 3aphospholipids 3apollutants 3atoxicity 3auric acid 3aSpain1 aGonzález-Domínguez, Raul,1 aGarcía Barrera, Tamara,1 aBlasco-Moreno, Julián1 aBebianno, M.

The results showed that storage of milk until the end of their shelf-life (day 3 for raw milk and day 21 for pasteurised milk) did not induce any significant change in pH, particle size, viscosity and their foaming properties (foaming capacity, foam stability and size of air bubbles) although there was a slight increase in free fatty acid content. Regarding foaming methods, the air injection method produced much less foam volume than mechanical mixing and steam injection, except for raw milk where mechanical mixing showed the least foamability. However, an opposite trend was observed for foam stability. Although air injection induced the largest size of air bubbles, it produced the most stable foam, which was much more stable than foam produced by mechanical mixing and steam injection.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3abubbles 3afatty acid composition 3afoaming 3afoaming capacity 3afree fatty acids 3amixing 3apH 3aparticle size 3apasteurized milk 3araw milk 3ashelf life 3askim milk 3asteam 3astorage temperature 3aviscosity 0aFoamability 0aFoam stability 0aFoam structure 0aMilk storage 0aFoaming method 0aShelf-life1 aLe, Thi Huynh Anh1 aYan, Anna1 aBhandari, Bhesh R.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8800-62951 aBansal, Nidhi1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2266-61240 tFood research international.g2019 Feb., v. 116 p.379-386dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl48420x0963-99697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodres.2018.08.0513Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02473naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245009700169300001800266520155800284592002801842650004101870650001401911650002401925650002101949650001101970650001101981700001901992773010302011856004802114852000902162655001202171IND50066168520221118124855.0130503e201306  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006616852DNAL7 a10.1007/s11269-013-0329-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKushwaha, Akansha10aHydrological Simulation in a Forest Dominated Watershed in Himalayan Region using SWAT Model  ap. 3005-3023.  aThe present study is taken up to test the suitability of SWAT (Soil and Water Assessment Tool) model for estimation of runoff and to understand sensitiveness of model input parameters in a predominantly forested watershed in Kumaun region of Himalaya. The study area Dabka is a small watershed (69.41 km²) lies in North West of Nainital in Uttarakhand. The SWAT is calibrated at an upstream intermediate gauging site Bagjhala draining approximately an area of 65.78 km² on monthly basis due to non-availability of observed data at main outlet. A local sensitivity analysis is performed on 13 input variables in terms of model outputs such as water yield, surface runoff and baseflow to gain in depth understanding of the role of different model parameters for their proper selection. The study concluded that model performed well with Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) value 0.242 for calibration and 0.81 for validation. Nash Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE) for calibration and validation period is obtained as 0.77 and 0.73 respectively whereas Coefficient of determination (R²) for calibration and validation period is 0.86 and 0.90 indicating good model performance. The most sensitive model parameters affecting water yield are CN2, GWQMN and SOL_Z. On the basis of sensitiveness of model parameters, the ranking of most sensitive parameters from highest sensitive to relatively lesser sensitiveness on stream flow are CN2, SOL_K and SOL_AWC whereas for base flow SOL_AWC, SOL_Z and GWQMN are found to be more sensitive followed by CN2, ESCO and SOL_K.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSoil and Water Assessment Tool model 3abase flow 3aforested watersheds 3amodel validation 3arunoff 3ayields1 aJain, Manoj K.0 tWater resources management.g2013 June, v. 27, no. 8 p.3005-3023dSpringer-Verlagx0920-47417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11269-013-0329-9  aDNAL 7aarticle03143naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002300144245014200167300001600309500002000325520159400345592002801939650003701967650001102004650001102015650001202026650001502038650001202053650001102065650001202076650002202088650001802110650001202128650001502140650001402155650002102169650002402190650001402214650001502228650001402243650001102257650002502268650001002293700002002303700001702323700001902340700001902359773014702378856007902525852000902604655001202613IND60587952220180301000000.0180118e201612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058795222DNAL7 a10.1002/jpln.2015003922doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aUlbricht, Matthias10aVariations of nutrient concentrations and contents between summer and autumn within tree compartments of European beech (Fagus sylvatica)  ap. 746-757.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe paradigm of sustainable forest management was initially aimed to ensure continuous wood supply but has gradually been extended for many functions and services of forest ecosystems, including the aspect of nutrient sustainability. The current tendency towards harvesting all year round and whole‐tree export for energy purposes raised the question of how the input : output balance of nutrients depends on site conditions, tree species, and harvest intensity. Possible differences in nutrient export between harvesting in autumn and summer have been more or less neglected. Based on compartment‐wise analyses of biomass and nutrient (Ca, K, Mg, and P) concentrations of adult European beeches (Fagus sylvatica [L.]), nine compartments were sampled in summer and nine in autumn. We found, for the majority of the compartments (especially in branch wood), increased levels of nutrient concentrations: 81% (Ca), 54% (K), 90% (Mg), and 96% (P) in autumn compared to summer. Upscaling our results to stand level revealed up to 10.0% and 1.6% less mineral nutrient exports of Ca and Mg, respectively, for whole‐tree harvest in forest stands when carried out in summer instead of autumn. Nutrient removal was increased by 0.8% and by 13.0% for K and P, respectively, in summer. Despite lower nutrient export, many ecological, logistic, and technical reasons discourage harvesting in summer. Our findings, however, deliver an additional yet so far missing mosaic piece for a better understanding and assessment of the frame conditions for sustainable nutrient management in beech forests.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFagus sylvatica subsp. sylvatica 3aadults 3aautumn 3abiomass 3abranchwood 3acalcium 3aenergy 3aexports 3aforest ecosystems 3aforest stands 3aforests 3aharvesting 3amagnesium 3anutrient content 3anutrient management 3anutrients 3aphosphorus 3apotassium 3asummer 3asustainable forestry 3atrees1 aGöttlein, Axel1 aBiber, Peter1 aDieler, Jochen1 aPretzsch, Hans0 tZeitschrift für Pflanzenernährung und Bodenkunde.g2016 Dec., v. 179, no. 6 p.746-757dWILEY‐VCH VerlagwJournal:jnl64178x1436-87307nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jpln.2015003923Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01669naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002300139245011900162300001800281520055100299592002800850650002300878650002300901650001900924650001800943650002200961650001300983700002000996700001901016700002301035700001801058700002201076700001801098773010701116856007501223852000901298655001201307IND60578755820221119034129.0170814e20140905xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057875582DNAL7 a10.1021/ol502116m2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTominaga, Masahide10aSelf-Assembly of a Tetrapodal Adamantane with Carbazole Branches into Hollow Spherical Aggregates in Organic Media  ap. 4622-4625.  aA hydrophobic tetrapodal molecule is composed of carbazole units at the periphery linked by a phenyl spacer on an adamantane core.

The findings of the previous studies clearly indicated that more than 50 % of the samples were contaminated with organophosphate, pyrethroids and organochlorine pesticides. Many studies reported that among fresh fruits and vegetables tomato, apple, melon, mango, grapes, and plum crossed the FAO/WHO permissible limits for these contaminants residual levels. The comparison of other regions showed that observed levels were found above maximum residue limits (MRLs) in 50 % of the samples but were in agreement with the studies from neighboring countries like China and Bangladesh. Higher hazard risk index (HRI) values were calculated for dieldrin, methamidophos, o,p′-DDT, diazinon and p,p′-DDT in apple, mango, banana, melon, potato and onion. The review also highlights that data on pesticide residues in foodstuff is scarce which should be overcome by further extending studies from different areas of Pakistan. In order to ascertain the provision of food suitable for human consumption, it is imperative to monitor pesticides in food commodities by the country’s authorities and enforce guidelines based on permissible limits.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFood and Agriculture Organization 3aWorld Health Organization 3aapples 3abananas 3adiazinon 3adieldrin 3afruits 3agrapes 3aguidelines 3ahuman health 3ahumans 3amangoes 3amaximum residue limits 3amelons 3amethamidophos 3aonions 3apesticide residues 3aplums 3apotatoes 3apyrethrins 3araw fruit 3arisk 3atomatoes 3aBangladesh 3aChina 3aPakistan1 aAlamdar, Ambreen1 aAshiq, Mohammad,1 aAhad, Karam1 aShabir, Zunera1 aAhmed, H.,1 aAli, Syeda Maria1 aSani, Syed Gul Abbas Shah1 aBokhari, Habib1 aGallagher, Kevin D.1 aAhmad, Iftikhar1 aEqani, Syed Ali Musstjab Akber Shah0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research international.g2014 Dec., v. 21, no. 23 p.13367-13393dSpringer-Verlagx0944-13447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-014-3117-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03668naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002100144245018800165300001600353500002000369520205400389592002802443650001702471650001902488650002102507650001102528650001202539650001202551650001202563650001002575650002302585650001402608650001802622650001602640650001402656650001502670650001402685650002602699650001102725650001802736650001402754650001202768650001502780651001102795700002502806700001802831700002202849700002002871773014702891856007903038852000903117655001203126IND60587952320180301000000.0180118e201612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058795232DNAL7 a10.1002/jpln.2016003282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMyrvang, Mona B.10aUptake of macro nutrients, barium, and strontium by vegetation from mineral soils on carbonatite and pyroxenite bedrock at the Lillebukt Alkaline Complex on Stjernøy, Northern Norway  ap. 705-716.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aCarbonatite originating from the Lillebukt Alkaline Complex at Stjernøy in Northern Norway possesses favorable lime and potassium (K) fertilizer characteristics. However, enrichments of barium (Ba) and strontium (Sr) in carbonatite may cause an undesired uptake by plants when applied to agroecosystems. A field survey was carried out to compare concentrations of Ba, Sr, and macronutrients in indigenous plants growing in mineral soil developed on a bedrock of apatite–biotite–carbonatite (high in Ba and Sr) and of apatite–hornblende–pyroxenite (low in Ba and Sr) at Stjernøy. Samples of soil and vegetation were collected from three sites, two on carbonatite bedrock and one on pyroxenite bedrock. Ammonium lactate (AL)‐extracted soil samples and nitric acid microwave‐digested samples of soil, grasses, dwarf shrubs, and herbs were analyzed for element concentration using ICP‐MS and ICP‐OES. Concentrations of magnesium (Mg) and calcium (Ca) in both soil (AL) and plants were equal to or higher compared to values commonly reported. A high transfer of phosphorus (P) from soil to plants indicates that the apatite‐P is available to plants, particularly in pyroxenite soil. The non‐exchangeable K reservoir in the soil made a significant contribution to the elevated K transfer from soil to plant. Total concentrations of Ba and Sr in surface soil exhibited a high spatial variation ranging from 490 to 5,300 mg Ba kg⁻¹ and from 320 to 1,300 mg Sr kg⁻¹. The transfer of AL‐extractable elements from soil to plants increased in the order Ba < Sr < Ca < Mg < K, hence reflecting the chemical binding strength of these elements. Concentrations of Ba and Sr were low in grasses (≈ 20 mg kg⁻¹), intermediate in dwarf shrubs and highest in herbs. Plant species and their affinity for Ca seemed more important in explaining the uptake of Ba and Sr than the soil concentration of these elements. The leguminous plant species Vicia cracca acted as an accumulator of both Ba (1.800 mg kg⁻¹) and Sr (2.300 mg kg⁻¹).  aPublisher supplied data 3aVicia cracca 3aagroecosystems 3aammonium lactate 3abarium 3abedrock 3acalcium 3agrasses 3aherbs 3aindigenous species 3amagnesium 3amineral soils 3anitric acid 3anutrients 3aphosphorus 3apotassium 3apotassium fertilizers 3ashrubs 3asoil sampling 3astrontium 3asurveys 3avegetation 3aNorway1 aHillersøy, Maria H.1 aHeim, Michael1 aBleken, Marina A.1 aGjengedal, Elin0 tZeitschrift für Pflanzenernährung und Bodenkunde.g2016 Dec., v. 179, no. 6 p.705-716dWILEY‐VCH VerlagwJournal:jnl64178x1436-87307nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jpln.2016003283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01274naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002700139245014100166300001800307520030500325592002800630650002400658650002900682650001300711650003000724650000900754700003000763773010700793856007500900852000900975655001200984IND60578755920221119034125.0170814e20140905xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057875592DNAL7 a10.1021/ol502120q2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBose, Shubhankar

The variation in colony form is shown to depend on (i) the types of single carbon substrates (sugars and sugar alcohols) used in the growth medium, (ii) colony age, (iii) incubation temperature, (iv) light cycle and (v) substrate type. Expanding colonies grow in a developmental sequence that show synchronize growth phase shifts as well as unusual transitions from homogeneous to sectored, yeast to mycelial and giant to microcolonial growth forms. Epigenetic influences on phenotypic switches are suggested to be potential causes of form changes. The desirable properties of a model organism for studying phenotypic plasticity are discussed and past work on the yeast-mycelial transition of fungi is reviewed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aphenotypic plasticity 3aAureobasidium pullulans 2aAscomycotaxdrug effectsxphysiologyxradiation effects. 2aCulture Mediaxchemistry 2aDNA, Fungalxanalysisxgenetics. 2aEpigenesis, Geneticxdrug effects 2aGene Expression Regulation, Fungalxdrug effects 2aGlucosexchemistryxmetabolism. 2aLight 2aModels, Biological 2aNiacinamidexpharmacology 2aPhenotype 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 2aTemperature 2aVitamin B Complexxpharmacology 0aepigenetics 0amodel organism 0ayeast-mycelial transition1 aStarmer, W.

This plant rapidly takes up nutrients from water and forms dense floating mats over the water surface that may impact the biogeochemical processes and greenhouse gas production in paddy fields. In this study, we measured CH₄ and N₂O emissions from duckweed and non-duckweed plots in a subtropical paddy field in China during the period of rice growth using static chamber and gas chromatography methods. Our results showed that CH₄ emission rate ranged from 0.19 to 26.50 mg m⁻² h⁻¹ in the duckweed plots, and from 1.02 to 28.02 mg m⁻² h⁻¹ in the non-duckweed plots. The CH₄ emission peak occurred about 1 week earlier in the duckweed plots compared to the non-duckweed counterparts. The mean CH₄ emission rate in the duckweed plots (9.28 mg m⁻² h⁻¹) was significantly lower than that in non-duckweed plots (11.66 mg m⁻² h⁻¹) (p < 0.05), which might be attributed to the higher water and soil Eh in the former. N₂O emission rates varied between −50.11 and 201.82 µg m⁻² h⁻¹, and between −28.93 and 54.42 µg m⁻² h⁻¹ in the duckweed and non-duckweed plots, respectively. The average N₂O emission rate was significantly higher in the duckweed plots than in the non-duckweed plots (40.29 vs. 11.93 µg m⁻² h⁻¹) (p < 0.05). Our results suggest that the presence of duckweed will reduce CH₄ emission, but increase N₂O flux simultaneously. Taking into account the combined global warming potentials of CH₄ and N₂O, we found that growing duckweed could reduce the overall greenhouse effect of subtropical paddy fields by about 17 %.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLemna minor 3agas chromatography 3aglobal warming 3agreenhouse effect 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3agreenhouse gases 3amacrophytes 3amethane 3anitrous oxide 3anutrients 3apaddies 3arice 3asoil water 3asurface water 3avegetation 3aChina1 aLi, Shouchun1 aLai, Derrick Y.

Based on Chinese provincial data from 2000 to 2019, we analyzed the impact of income inequality on energy consumption and carbon emissions from both theoretical and empirical perspectives, focusing on the impact mechanism, moderating effect, and threshold effect of ICT capital on the relationship between income inequality and energy consumption and carbon emissions. The study finds that income inequality increases energy consumption and carbon emissions, whereas regardless of whether it is hardware, software, or communication capital, ICT capital effectively mitigates the growth of energy consumption and carbon emissions caused by income inequality, with a significant inhibitory effect. Furthermore, ICT capital has a stronger moderating effect on energy consumption and carbon emissions in urban and developed eastern region. Notably, the effect of income inequality on the growth of energy consumption and carbon emissions diminishes non-linearly with increasing ICT capital. This study confirms that an increase in ICT capital contributes to the “win-win-win” situation of shared prosperity, energy-saving, and emission-reduction, providing useful empirical guidance for China and similar countries to fully utilize ICT capital in the digital economy.  aPublisher supplied data 3acapital 3acarbon 3acommunications technology 3acomputer software 3aenergy 3aenergy conservation 3aenvironmental management 3asocial inequality 3aChina 0aShared prosperity 0aCarbon neutrality 0aInformation and communication technology capital 0aChinese evidence1 aZhong, Meirui0 tJournal of environmental management.g2022 Oct. 01, v. 319 p.115710-dElsevier LtdwJournal:2018x0301-47977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2022.1157103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01696naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094024002200130024001900152040001800171100001800189245004400207300001300251506007600264520051700340592002800857506003700885650002200922650001400944650001100958650001100969650002200980650003501002700002201037700001501059700001501074700002301089773010701112856008201219852000901301655001201310IND60119382020221207101917.0141214e200911  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011938202DNAL7 a10.1186/gb-2009-10-11-r1342doi7 aPMC30913272pmcid7 a199305502pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLangmead, Ben10aSearching for SNPs with cloud computing  ap. 2284.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aAs DNA sequencing outpaces improvements in computer speed, there is a critical need to accelerate tasks like alignment and SNP calling.

In contrast to the typical columnar assembly of other bis-urea macrocycles, 1 assembled into interdigitated layers to afford a host with small 1D channels with a pore diameter of ∼4.5 Å. Herein, we discuss the origin between the expected and observed assembly and demonstrate the utility of these activated organic crystals to absorb a guest and maintain crystallinity during the reaction of the encapsulated guest and subsequent product isolation. Isoprene was chosen as a model monomer due to the small channel diameter of 1. The activated crystals were able to absorb isoprene and facilitate a photoinitiated and stereoselective oligomerization to produce trans-1,4-polyisoprene with low dispersity. The products were readily extracted from the crystals and analysis of the microstructure of the oligomer showed 97% trans-1,4 content and a dispersity (Đ) of 1.39. Despite the altered assembly pattern of this bis-urea macrocycle, powder X-ray diffraction studies demonstrated that the crystalline host was remarkably robust and stable throughout the activation, isoprene absorption, photoinduced polymerization, and product recovery processes. Our future investigations are focused on assessing the stability of the isoprene radicals within the host and evaluating the loading and reaction of other monomers.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3acrystal structure 3acrystals 3aencapsulation 3afree radicals 3aisoprene 3amicrostructure 3amodels 3aoligomerization 3aphotochemical reactions 3apolymerization 3astereoselectivity1 aXu, Yuewen1 aSom, Bozumeh1 aSindt, Ammon J.1 aSmith, Mark D.1 aShimizu, Linda S.0 tRSC advances.g2016 Oct. 14, v. 6, no. 100 p.98350-98355dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c6ra18681e3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02285naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002400111040001800135100002000153245007600173300001600249520067400265592002800939650002700967650003000994650003001024650001001054650001401064650002701078650001901105650002301124650005101147650002001198650003101218650002101249650003301270650003101303650002801334650001401362650002401376653002301400653001501423653001201438653001501450653001001465700001601475700002401491700002401515700002201539773010201561852000901663856007101672655001201743IND4431199520221122105632.0200516e20091101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443119952DNAL7 a199277502pmid7 a10.3852/09-0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAnco, Daniel J.10aTransformation of Phomopsis viticola with the green fluorescent protein  ap. 853-858.  aPhomopsis viticola is the causal agent of Phomopsis cane and leaf spot on Vitis spp., a persistent and economically important disease in temperate regions.

Novel low molecular weight chitosan-PVA soft membranes have been studied for antibacterial and wound healing properties. The effectiveness of antibacterial activity was carried against bacterial pathogens while wound healing nature of chitosan was conducted in second degree burns on rabbits as model animal. Rabbits were divided into three groups; control untreated, treated with commercial Fusidic acid (Fu-A) cream and chitosan-PVA membranes. Low molecular weight chitosan showed significant antibacterial property towards bacterial pathogens. Wound healing experiments on second degree burn exhibited chitosan as significant wound healing agent for wound dressings. In morphological studies, normal growth of epidermis was observed and chitosan exhibited more effective for wound healing. Morphological studies also showed that chitosan wound dressings accelerated the granule and fibrous connective tissues formation. Physical characteristics of chitosan-PVA membranes were evaluated by water uptake capacity, SEM analysis, mechanical and water barrier studies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantibacterial properties 3aburns (injuries) 3achitosan 3aconnective tissues 3acream 3aglycerol 3amolecular weight 3apathogens 3apolymers 3arabbits 3ascanning electron microscopy 3atissue repair 3awater uptake 0aChitosan 0aAntimicrobial 0aWound healing1 aArshad, Muḥammad,1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7199-01181 aYasin, Tariq1 aGhauri, Muhammad Afzal0 tInternational journal of biological macromolecules.g2019 Mar. 01, v. 124 p.155-162dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12340x0141-81307nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2018.11.0733Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01552naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002400111040001800135100002100153245008000174300001600254520032400270592002800594650001200622650001900634650001600653650001900669650005100688650001900739650001400758650002400772651001100796651001100807653001600818653001300834653001100847653001500858653001300873700002300886700002700909773010200936852000901038856007101047655001201118IND4431199820221122105625.0200516e20091101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443119982DNAL7 a199277522pmid7 a10.3852/08-1062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWartchow, Felipe10aAmanita lippiae: a new species from the semi-arid caatinga region of Brazil  ap. 864-870.  aAmanita lippiae is described as a new species from a semi-arid (caatinga) region of northeastern Brazil.

Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying the adaptation of canola to salt stress is important to improve salt tolerance and promote its cultivation in saline soils. To elucidate the metabolic and transcriptional regulatory mechanisms in canola under salt stress, the seedling roots of the control (no salt treatment) and roots of canola seedlings subjected to 72 h of 200 mM NaCl stress (hydroponics) were collected for metabolomic analysis, supplemented with RNA-Seq analysis and quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) validation. Metabolomic analysis showed that compared with the control, the metabolites of lipids accumulated more under NaCl stress, including unsaturated fatty acids (linoleic acid, dihomo-gamma-linolenic acid, oleic acid, nervonic acid, alpha-linolenic acid), glycerophospholipids (1-palmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine, 1-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine, 1-stearoyl-2-hydroxy-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine) lecithin (phosphorylcholine), sphingolipids (N-palmitoylsphingosine) and steroids and steroid derivatives (25-hydroxyvitamin D3); while the metabolism of most amino acids (such as L-valine, L-threonine, L-isoleucine, L-glutamate, L-phenylalanine) and carbohydrates (such as D-fructose, cellobiose, sucrose, D-mannose) were lower. Both transcriptomic and metabolomic pathway analysis indicated that lipid metabolism was an important metabolic pathway in canola roots under NaCl stress. In summary, canola seedling roots could respond to NaCl stress through lipid metabolism genes and metabolites, which improved our knowledge in molecular mechanisms encoding NaCl tolerance in canola.  aPublisher supplied data  a2020BC001cScience and Technology Cooperation Program of XPCC  a2018AA005cMajor Program of XPCC 3a25-hydroxycholecalciferol 3aBrassica napus 3aagricultural development 3aalpha-linolenic acid 3abiochemical pathways 3acanola 3acellobiose 3afructose 3aglutamic acid 3ahydroponics 3alecithins 3alinoleic acid 3alipid metabolism 3amannose 3ametabolites 3ametabolomics 3anervonic acid 3aoleic acid 3aphenylalanine 3aphosphorylcholine 3aplant growth 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3aroot systems 3asalt stress 3asalt tolerance 3aseedlings 3asequence analysis 3asoil salinity 3asphingolipids 3asucrose 3athreonine 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranscriptomics 3avaline1 aPang, Jiayin1 aZhang, Fenghua1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9541-41581 aSun, Lupeng1 aYang, Lei1 aSiddique, Kadambot H.

The molecular defense responses of red seaweeds are largely unknown. In this study, we surveyed the defense-related transcripts of an agarophyte, Gracilaria changii, treated with β-agarase through next generation sequencing (NGS). We also compared the defense responses of seaweed elicited by agarase with those elicited by an agarolytic bacterium isolated from seaweed, by profiling the expression of defense-related genes using quantitative reverse transcription real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). NGS detected a total of 391 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) with a higher abundance (>2-fold change with a p value <0.001) in the agarase-treated transcriptome compared to that of the non-treated G. changii. Among these DEGs were genes related to signaling, bromoperoxidation, heme peroxidation, production of aromatic amino acids, chorismate, and jasmonic acid. On the other hand, the genes encoding a superoxide-generating NADPH oxidase and related to photosynthesis were downregulated. The expression of these DEGs was further corroborated by qRT-PCR results which showed more than 90 % accuracy. A comprehensive analysis of their gene expression profiles between 1 and 24 h post treatments (hpt) revealed that most of the genes analyzed were consistently upregulated or downregulated by both agarase and agarolytic bacterial treatments, indicating that the defense responses induced by both treatments are highly similar except for genes encoding vanadium bromoperoxidase and animal heme peroxidase. Our study has provided the first glimpse of the molecular defense responses of G. changii to agarase and agarolytic bacterial treatments.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGracilaria 3aNAD(P)H oxidase (H2O2-forming) 3aamino acids 3abacteria 3abeta-agarase 3acell walls 3achorismic acid 3aepiphytes 3agene expression 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3aheme 3ahigh-throughput nucleotide sequencing 3ahosts 3ajasmonic acid 3amacroalgae 3aperoxidase 3aperoxidation 3aphotosynthesis 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3atranscriptome 3atranscriptomics1 aSiow, Rouh-San1 aAbdul Rahim, Raha1 aHo, Chai-Ling0 tMarine biotechnology.g2016 Apr., v. 18, no. 2 p.189-200dSpringer USx1436-22287nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10126-015-9680-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01175naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100001800154245005500172300001800227520025000245592002800495650001900523650002400542650003500566650000900601700002000610700002200630773010100652856008800753990002300841852000900864655001200873IND60098507420221123030633.0141104e20110315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009850742DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fertnstert.2010.12.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFainaru, Ofer10aOral nimodipine inhibits the ovarian cycle in mice  ap. 1494-1496.  aNimodipine, a calcium-channel blocker that can cross the blood-brain barrier, has been shown to inhibit pulsatile GnRH release in vitro.

Textural properties of MIPs and nonimprinted polymer (NIP) were characterized by an N₂ adsorption experiment, thermogravimetric analysis, and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. NO₂ basic adsorption conditions were set as 40 °C for the temperature, 100 mL/min for the flow rate, and 1000 ppm for the NO₂ concentration through fixed-bed breakthrough experiments, and at these conditions, the NO₂ adsorption capacity of MIP1, MIP2, and NIP was 0.58, 0.63, and 0.51 mg/g, respectively. The NO₂ adsorption performance was nearly unaffected by O₂; however, SO₂ and CO₂ inhibited NO₂ adsorption severely. The H₂O molecule had fewer negative effects on NO₂ adsorption because of the large number of hydrophobic groups −(CH₂–CH)ₙ– in polymers and the hydrogen bond force between H₂O molecules.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aacetic acid 3aacrylamides 3aadsorption 3acarbon dioxide 3aflue gas 3ahydrogen bonding 3ahydrophobicity 3anitrogen 3anitrogen dioxide 3aoxygen 3apolymers 3aprocess design 3asulfur dioxide 3atemperature 3atexture 3athermogravimetry1 aWang, Han1 aHao, Siqi0 tIndustrial & engineering chemistry process design and development.g2017 Aug. 16, v. 56, no. 32 p.9116-9123dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23342x1520-50457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.iecr.7b014013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02173naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001700152245009700169300001600266520081300282592002801095650004401123650001801167650001301185650001201198650001101210650004101221650000901262650001301271650004401284650000901328650001101337650001701348650001401365650001401379650001601393653001201409653001701421653000901438653001701447700002301464700002401487773009701511856008601608852000901694655001201703IND60561835120221120114910.0170124e201402  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056183512DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enconman.2013.11.0222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aÖnal, Eylem10aBio-oil production via co-pyrolysis of almond shell as biomass and high density polyethylene  ap. 704-710.  aBiomass from almond shell (aS) was co-pyrolyzed with high density polyethylene (HDPE) polymer to investigate the synergistic effects on the product yields and compositions. The pyrolysis temperature was selected as 500°C, based on results of TGA-DTG. Co-pyrolysis of HDPE-biomass mixtures were pyrolysed with various proportions such as 1:0, 1:1, 1:2, 2:1 and 0:1. The yield of liquids produced during co-pyrolysis enhanced 23%, as the weight ratio of HDPE in the mixture was doubled. Obtained bio-oils were analyzed with using column chromatography, 1H NMR, GC/MS, and FT-IR. According to analyses results, produced liquids by co-pyrolysis had higher carbon (26% higher) and hydrogen contents (78% higher), lower oxygen content (%86 less) with a higher heating value (38% higher) than those of biomass oil.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aalmond shells 3abiofuels 3abiomass 3acarbon 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3aheat 3ahydrogen 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aoils 3aoxygen 3apolyethylene 3apyrolysis 3asynergism 3atemperature 0aBio oil 0aCo-pyrolysis 0aHDPE 0aAlmond shell1 aUzun, Başak Burcu1 aPütün, Ayşe Eren0 tEnergy conversion and management.g2014 Feb., v. 78 p.704-710dElsevier Ltdx0196-89047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enconman.2013.11.0223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02520naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005800148245014600206300001800352500001100370520133100381592002801712596004601740650001601786650001101802650001301813650001301826650002701839650002501866650001901891700005801910773012201968856008302090852000902173655001202182IND60774587020221120023558.0220421e202204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077458702DNAL7 a10.1007/s10853-022-07092-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBilisik, Kadir1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0592-980X10aPolymer nanocomposites based on graphite nanoplatelets (GNPs): a review on thermal-electrical conductivity, mechanical and barrier properties  ap. 7425-7480.  aReview  aIn this paper, graphite nanoplatelets (GNPs)-based polymer nanocomposites were reviewed. This review mainly discusses various synthesis techniques for making graphite nanoplatelets (GNPs) including dispersion of GNPs in polymers, functionalization and producing GNPs polymer nanocomposites. In addition, their critical morphology and rheological, mechanical, electrical, and thermal conductivity as well as gas barrier properties were explained. It was found that when GNPs were properly incorporated into the polymer matrix, they can enhance the properties of the host polymer at extreme conditions. Moreover, surface modification of GNPs by covalent and non-covalent functionalization has been explored as a new platform for realizing structure–property interactions of polymer nanocomposites. Proposed predictive modeling and analysis methods on the mechanical, electrical, and thermal conductivities and gas barrier properties of GNPs/polymer nanocomposites were also disclosed considering, in particular, GNPs geometry and orientation in polymers. It was concluded that GNPs added to thermoset and thermoplastic polymer nanocomposites exhibit conceivable developments in advanced engineering uses, including electronics, ultra-sensitive sensors, membranes, energy storage, wearable technology, aerospace and biomedical.  aPublisher supplied data  aFBD-2020-10069cErciyes Üniversitesi BAP 3aelectronics 3aenergy 3ageometry 3agraphene 3apolymer nanocomposites 3athermal conductivity 3athermoplastics1 aAkter, Mahmuda1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6730-39600 tJournal of materials science.g2022 Apr., v. 57, no. 15 p.7425-7480dSpringer USwJournal:jnl4392857x0022-24617nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10853-022-07092-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01685naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100002200154245008000176300002100256520048900277592002800766650003600794650001800830650000900848650001200857650005200869700002300921700002500944700002200969700002900991700002001020700002301040700002401063773010401087856008801191990002301279852000901302655001201311IND60098507520221123030704.0141104e20110315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009850752DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fertnstert.2010.12.0232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKiapekou, Erasmia10aCorticotropin-releasing hormone inhibits in vitro oocyte maturation in mice  ap. 1497-1499.e1.  aThe expression of corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) receptor 1 messenger RNA in stages of follicle growth was examined by reverse transcriptase–polymerase chain reaction in long-term cultures of early preantral mouse follicles with and without CRH addition.

Conservation actions and increased wintertime food availability have led to a population increase of several large herbivorous waterbird species. In Northern Europe, this trend is opposite to the overall decrease of several smaller waterbird species. We examined whether the recovery of a flagship species, the whooper swan (Cygnus cygnus), and the spreading of the non-native Canada goose (Branta canadensis), cause asymmetric competition with other sympatric waterbirds at their breeding sites. We used data from the national Finnish waterbird surveys collected in the late 1980s and early 2020 s at 942 sites, to assess the site-level effects of large herbivore occurrence on other waterbird species, while considering their trophic overlap. We hypothesised that there could be competitive effects of large herbivorous on smaller species, especially those with similar foraging niches. We however found that other waterbird populations have decreased less at sites occupied by whooper swans since the 1980 s. Canada goose site occupation was not associated with the abundance of other waterbirds. Thereby, our findings are not consistent with the suggestion that population increases of large herbivore species lead to asymmetric competition on the breeding wetlands. The whooper swan may potentially act as an indicator of habitat quality and further on as a flagship umbrella species with multidisciplinary conservation benefits, of which may accrue benefits also to other waterbirds exhibiting declining population trends. Our findings underline the importance of considering species interactions when designing and implementing management actions in conservation strategies.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aBranta canadensis 3aCygnus cygnus 3aflagship species 3afood availability 3aherbivores 3aoccupations 3apopulation growth 3aswans 3asympatry 3awaterfowl 3awinter 3aNorthern European region 0aAsymmetric competition 0aFlagship umbrella 0aIndicator 0aWaterbird 0aWetland1 aČehovská, Markéta1 aJaatinen, Kim1 aLaaksonen, Toni1 aLindén, Andreas1 aNummi, Petri1 aPiha, Markus1 aPöysä, Hannu1 aToivanen, Tero1 aVäänänen, Veli-Matti1 aLehikoinen, Aleksi0 tGlobal ecology and conservation.g2022 Aug., v. 36 p.e02144-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23212x2351-98947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gecco.2022.e021443Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03400naa a2200673 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245010700167520145800274592002801732650001301760650002101773650001901794650001701813650001001830650001001840650003801850650003001888650002301918650001901941650001801960650000901978650003701987650001602024650001702040650001402057650003402071650002402105650003602129650003202165650001402197650001402211653002902225653001402254653001402268653001002282653001102292653001302303700001702316700001402333700001702347700002002364700001802384700001802402700001402420700001902434700001402453700001802467700001602485700001602501773010202517856008602619852000902705655001202714IND60684199720221120090426.0200503e202005  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068419972DNAL7 a10.1016/j.micpath.2020.1040422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHan, Lichao10aMicrobiological profile of distinct virulence of Nocardia cyriacigeorgica strains in vivo and in vitro  aThere are significant differences between different Nocardia species regarding geographical distribution, biochemical features, phenotypic characterization, and drug sensitivity. In this study, we explored the differences in virulence and pathogenic mechanisms of two Nocardia cyriacigeorgica strains. We examined the difference in virulence between N. cyriacigeorgica ATCC14759 and N. cyriacigeorgica GUH-2 by measuring cytotoxicity, animal survival after infection, the ability of host cell invasion, and viability in host cells. Western blotting was used to compare the differences in activation of MAPKs, including p38, ERK, and JNK, the NF-κB signaling pathway, and the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway in A549 and RAW264.7 cells. We measured the difference in stimulatory effects on production of the cytokines IL-6, IL-10, and TNF-α by ELISA. We found that N. cyriacigeorgica ATCC14759 causes higher cytotoxicity in cultured cells and higher lethality in mice, and exhibits superior invasion ability and viability in host cells compared with N. cyriacigeorgica GUH-2. Moreover, these two strains show marked differences in activation of the expression of cytokines and signaling pathways. N. cyriacigeorgica ATCC14759 is more virulent than N. cyriacigeorgica GUH-2. Furthermore, there is a significant difference in pathogenesis between the two strains. Our results provide a theoretical basis for the prevention and treatment of Nocardia infection.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNocardia 3aWestern blotting 3acultured cells 3acytotoxicity 3adeath 3adrugs 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3ageographical distribution 3ahost cell invasion 3ainterleukin-10 3ainterleukin-6 3amice 3amitogen-activated protein kinase 3anocardiosis 3apathogenesis 3aphenotype 3aphosphatidylinositol 3-kinase 3asignal transduction 3atranscription factor NF-kappa B 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha 3aviability 3avirulence 0aNocardia cyriacigeorgica 0aVirulence 0aCytokines 0aMAPKs 0aNF-κB 0aPI3K/Akt1 aJi, Xingzhao1 aXu, Shuai1 aFan, Shihong1 aWang, Chengling1 aWei, Kongjiao1 aWang, Xuebing1 aSong, Han1 aZheng, Ningwei1 aSun, Lina1 aQiu, Xiaotong1 aHou, Xuexin1 aLi, Zhenjun0 tMicrobial pathogenesis.g2020 May, v. 142 p.104042-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11911x0882-40107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.micpath.2020.1040423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01613naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001200140245008500152300001800237520060100255592002800856650001200884650002300896650002300919650003400942700002000976700002000996700001801016700001501034700002101049773013401070856007401204852000901278655001201287IND60617477520221118095543.0181025e20180410xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061747752DNAL7 a10.1039/c8cc00907d2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Yue10aHypophosphite hybrid perovskites: a platform for unconventional tilts and shifts  ap. 3751-3754.  aFollowing the recent discovery of the [A]Mn(H₂POO)₃ (H₂POO⁻ = hypophosphite) perovskite family, we report the A = [NH₂(CH₃)₂]⁺ (dimethylammonium, DMA) member.

The structure of the coal/rock pore fracture, which is a key element for the development of CBM resources, changes significantly due to the influence of mining. In this study, the pore volume and pore size distribution (PSD) of six coals (three parallel bedding coals and three vertical bedding coals), three mudstones, and three sandstones before and after fracture are compared from the perspective of macro and micro using a triaxial compression experiment and high-pressure mercury intrusion porosimetry, and the pore-fracture evolution of the coal under different confining pressures is studied. By quantificationally characterizing the pore-fracture strain of fractured coal/rock, an equivalent model based on plastic deformation is proposed. Combined with the pore-fracture characteristics of coal/rock strata in abandoned mines, the influence of the coal/rock fracture on CBM migration is discussed. The results show that (1) the pore volumes of coal, mudstone, and sandstone are significantly reduced after the fracture. The compression of coal is more significant than that of other samples. The macropore (>50 nm) volume of coal and mudstone decreased sharply in the process of loading, while that of mesopores (2–50 nm) changed little. For sandstones, the macropore and mesopore volumes are compressed. (2) With the increase of effective stress, the compression degree of pores increases; especially, the volume of macropores decreases significantly. (3) The expansion of fracture is beneficial to the migration of CBM, while pore compression reduces the diffusion path. The ultimate performance of CBM migration in mining-disturbed strata is determined by the net effect of two competing effects. This study has a guiding role in improving the pore-fracture strain physical model of fractured coal/rock and revealing the CBM migration in abandoned mines.  aPublisher supplied data 3acoal 3acoalbed methane 3aenergy 3amacropores 3amercury 3amodels 3amudstone 3aplastic deformation 3aporosimetry 3aporosity 3asandstone1 aFu, Xuehai1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6566-51481 aKang, Junqiang1 aTian, Zhongbin1 aShen, Youyi0 tEnergy & fuels.g2020 Dec. 30, v. 35, no. 2 p.1208-1218dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23338x1520-50297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.energyfuels.0c032813Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02043naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002700150245012700177520096200304592002801266650002001294650001401314650001301328650001501341653002301356653002601379653001001405653000801415653000801423700002901431700002001460700002001480773009901500856008501599852000901684655001201693IND60782049820221120062805.0220929e202207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078204982DNAL7 a10.1016/j.powtec.2022.1176922doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBabaoğlu, Nihan Uygur14aThe effect of axial cyclone inlet velocity and geometrical dimensions on the flow pattern, performance, and acoustic noise  aThis article studied the effect of the inlet velocity and various geometric dimensions on the flow pattern, collection efficiency, pressure drop, and acoustic noise of axial cyclones using computational fluid dynamics (CFD).

Despite significant efforts, the repair of large segmental bone defects is a substantial clinical challenge which requires bone substitute materials or a bone graft. The available biomaterials lack the adequate mechanical strength to withstand the static and dynamic loads while maintaining sufficient porosity to facilitate cell in-growth and vascularization during bone tissue regeneration. A wide range of advanced biomaterials are being currently designed to mimic the physical as well as the chemical composition of a bone by forming polymer blends, polymer–ceramic and polymer–degradable metal composites. Transforming these novel biomaterials into porous and load-bearing structures via three-dimensional printing (3DP) has emerged as a popular manufacturing technique to develop engineered bone grafts. 3DP has been adopted as a versatile tool to design and develop bone grafts that satisfy porosity and mechanical requirements while having the ability to form grafts of varied shapes and sizes to meet the physiological requirements. In addition to providing surfaces for cell attachment and eventual bone formation, these bone grafts also have to provide physical support during the repair process. Hence, the mechanical competence of the 3D-printed scaffold plays a key role in the success of the implant. In this review, we present various recent strategies that have been utilized to design and develop robust biomaterials that can be deployed for 3D-printing bone substitutes. The article also reviews some of the practical, theoretical and biological considerations adopted in the 3D-structure design and development for bone tissue engineering.  aPublisher supplied data 3abone formation 3abone substitutes 3abone transplantation 3abones 3achemical composition 3apolymers 3aporosity 3astrength (mechanics) 3atissue repair1 aGolebiowska, Aleksandra A.1 aDash, Madhusmita1 aKumar, Prasoon1 aJain, Prashant Kumar1 aNukavarapu, Syam P.1 aRamakrishna, Seeram1 aNanda, Himansu Sekhar0 tBiomaterials science.g2022 May 31, v. 10, no. 11 p.2789-2816dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26911x2047-48497nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d2bm00035k3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03147naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001700149245010400166506011700270506007600387520148700463592002801950506003701978650002502015650001702040650002502057650001702082650001202099650002402111650001302135650001302148650000902161650002402170650001502194650002402209650001302233653002402246653001002270653001302280653001302293653003302306700001702339700001802356700001702374700001502391700001802406773011202424856008402536852000902620655001202629IND60776564620221207084529.0220614e202208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077656462DNAL7 a10.1016/j.gecco.2022.e021462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHe, Mengxuan10aOptimization of nitrogen, water and salinity for maximizing soil organic carbon in coastal wetlands  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aMaintaining carbon sequestration is becoming increasingly significant and challenging during coastal wetland carbon restoration. To clear the influence of water, nitrogen and salinity on soil organic carbon (SOC), indoor incubation experiments were carried out, where soil from wetlands with dominant vegetation of Phragmites australis and Suaeda salsa were sampled and Box-Behnken central composite design was used to maximize SOC. The results indicated that:1) water, nitrogen and salinity altered soil chemical and physical properties, then significantly affect SOC in Phragmites australis wetland, but possessed little impact on Suaeda salsa wetland. 2) Optimal condition was determined with water of − 5.49 cm, salinity of 3.52 ds/m and nitrogen of 13.40 g/m² for the biggest SOC of 8.6 g/kg in Phragmites australis wetland, whereas in Suaeda salsa wetland, SOC reached out to 8.7 g/kg with water of − 4.09 cm, salinity of 2.51 ds/m and nitrogen of 16.61 g/m². 3) Nitrogen and water were determining factors on SOC. In Phragmites australis wetland, SOC was substantially influenced by water, nitrogen and its interaction, while in Suaeda salsa wetland, water and nitrogen displayed no direct influence, but its interactive effect worked. 4) Quadratic models were found the most desirable to reveal connections between SOC and three factors (p < 0.05). Our finding could provide support for maintaining soil carbon sink in coastal wetland restoration management.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aPhragmites australis 3aSuaeda salsa 3acarbon sequestration 3acarbon sinks 3aecology 3aexperimental design 3anitrogen 3asalinity 3asoil 3asoil organic carbon 3avegetation 3awetland restoration 3awetlands 0aSoil organic carbon 0aWater 0aNitrogen 0aSalinity 0aResponse Surface Methodology1 aMo, Xunqiang1 aMeng, Weiqing1 aLi, Hongyuan1 aXu, Wenbin1 aHuang, Zhimei0 tGlobal ecology and conservation.g2022 Aug., v. 36 p.e02146-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23212x2351-98947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gecco.2022.e021463Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03491naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100006500145245008800210300001600298520186600314592002802180596008202208596002302290650001102313650001502324650001202339650001702351650001902368650002002387650003702407650001402444650002002458650001002478650000902488650001702497653002902514653002202543653003002565653003102595653001002626653003502636700001602671700001802687700001902705700002302724700001902747773011902766856007902885852000902964655001202973IND60619181520221119202935.0181031e20170701xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061918152DNAL7 a10.1093/treephys/tpx0372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPrendin, Angela Luisa1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5809-731410aNew research perspectives from a novel approach to quantify tracheid wall thickness  ap. 976-983.  aThe analysis of xylem cell anatomical features in dated tree rings provides insights into xylem functional responses and past growth conditions at intra-annual resolution. So far, special focus has been given to the lumen of the water-conducting cells, whereas the equally relevant cell wall thickness (CWT) has been less investigated due to methodological limitations. Here we present a novel approach to measure tracheid CWT in high-resolution images of wood cross-sections that is implemented within the specialized image-analysis tool ‘ROXAS’. Compared with the traditional manual line measurements along a selection of few radial files, this novel image-analysis tool can: (i) measure CWT of all tracheids in a tree-ring cross-section, thus increasing the number of individual tracheid measurements by a factor of ~10–20; (ii) measure the tangential and radial walls separately; and (iii) laterally integrate the measurements in a customizable way from only the thinnest central part of the cell walls up to the thickest part of the tracheids at the corners. Cell wall thickness measurements performed with our novel approach and the traditional manual approach showed comparable accuracy for several image resolutions, with an optimal accuracy–efficiency balance at 100× magnification. The configurable settings intended to underscore different cell wall properties indeed changed the absolute levels and intra- and inter-annual patterns of CWT. This versatility, together with the high data production capacity, allows to tailor the measurements of CWT to the specific goal of each study, which opens new research perspectives, e.g., for investigating structure–function relationships, tree stress responses and carbon allocation patterns, and for reconstructing climate based on intra- and inter-annual variability of anatomical wood density.  aPublisher supplied data  aC12.0100cSwiss State Secretariat for Education, Research and Innovation SERI  aF1106cCOST Action 3acarbon 3acell walls 3aclimate 3agrowth rings 3aimage analysis 3astress response 3astructure-activity relationships 3atracheids 3atree physiology 3atrees 3awood 3awood density 0aautomated image analysis 0acarbon allocation 0aquantitative wood anatomy 0aradial cell wall thickness 0aROXAS 0atangential cell wall thickness1 aPetit, Giai1 aCarrer, Marco1 aFonti, Patrick1 aBjörklund, Jesper1 avon Arx, Georg0 tTree physiology.g2017 July 01, v. 37, no. 7 p.976-983dOxford University PresswJournal:jnl41003x1758-44697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/treephys/tpx0373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02932naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002500145245010300170300001800273520156000291592002801851650002801879650001201907650001101919650001501930650001101945650002101956650001901977650001701996650001502013650001002028650001402038650000902052650001102061650001002072650002002082653002202102653001902124653001702143653002002160653001602180700002302196700002202219773012102241856007902362852000902441655001202450IND60619181620221119202810.0181031e20170801xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061918162DNAL7 a10.1093/treephys/tpx0382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCampany, Courtney E.10aReduced growth due to belowground sink limitation is not fully explained by reduced photosynthesis  ap. 1042-1054.  aSink limitation is known to reduce plant growth, but it is not known how plant carbon (C) balance is affected, limiting our ability to predict growth under sink-limited conditions. We manipulated soil volume to impose sink limitation of growth in Eucalyptus tereticornis Sm. seedlings. Seedlings were grown in the field in containers of different sizes and planted flush to the soil alongside freely rooted (Free) seedlings. Container volume negatively affected aboveground growth throughout the experiment, and light saturated rates of leaf photosynthesis were consistently lower in seedlings in containers (−26%) compared with Free seedlings. Significant reductions in photosynthetic capacity in containerized seedlings were related to both reduced leaf nitrogen content and starch accumulation, indicating direct effects of sink limitation on photosynthetic downregulation. After 120 days, harvested biomass of Free seedlings was on average 84% higher than seedlings in containers, but biomass distribution in leaves, stems and roots was not different. However, the reduction in net leaf photosynthesis over the growth period was insufficient to explain the reduction in growth, so that we also observed an apparent reduction in whole-plant C-use efficiency (CUE) between Free seedlings and seedlings in containers. Our results show that sink limitation affects plant growth through feedbacks to both photosynthesis and CUE. Mass balance approaches to predicting plant growth under sink-limited conditions need to incorporate both of these feedbacks.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEucalyptus tereticornis 3abiomass 3acarbon 3acontainers 3aleaves 3anitrogen content 3aphotosynthesis 3aplant growth 3aprediction 3aroots 3aseedlings 3asoil 3astarch 3astems 3atree physiology 0acarbon allocation 0aphotosynthesis 0aplant growth 0asink regulation 0asoil volume1 aMedlyn, Belinda E.1 aDuursma, Remko A.0 tTree physiology.g2017 Aug. 01, v. 37, no. 8 p.1042-1054dOxford University PresswJournal:jnl41003x1758-44697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/treephys/tpx0383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03300naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001700152245013300169500001900302520174100321592002802062650001802090650002702108650001702135650002102152650001302173650001502186650001102201650002702212650001702239650001202256650001902268650002102287650002302308651001002331653002102341653003002362653001802392700001902410700001702429700001702446700001702463700001702480700001802497700001802515700001502533700001402548773011202562856008702674852000902761655001202770IND60707438620221117031817.0200913e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070743862DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jaridenv.2020.1042552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJiang, Chong10aExamining the soil erosion responses to ecological restoration programs and landscape drivers: A spatial econometric perspective  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aTopsoil erosion is a widespread and major threat to terrestrial ecosystems that leads to environmental deterioration. Monitoring soil erosion dynamics and understanding the driving mechanisms are of great significance for optimizing ecological restoration programs and combating land degradation. We apply a widely used soil erosion assessment model to quantify the changes in soil erosion on the Loess Plateau (LP) in response to afforestation-induced vegetation cover and land use/cover changes. Furthermore, we examine the relationship between landscape metrics and soil erosion using spatial econometric approach. The results indicate that soil erosion in the LP substantially decreased through afforestation efforts, while the observed sediment load declined significantly as a result of soil and water conservation programs. A number of largescale ecological programs altered the spatial configuration and structural composition of the landscape from different aspects, which disturbed the formation and transportation of soil erosion, eventually resulting in a reduction in soil loss. The spatial association between landscape metrics and soil erosion indicated that properly fragmented landscapes can effectively decrease soil erosion. Due to the spatial spillover, soil erosion in one county can be affected by soil erosion in adjacent counties. Therefore, the spillover effect between counties should not be ignored, and the responsibility for formulating and implementing solutions to combat land degradation should not fall solely on individual local governments. Preferably, the cooperation between different regions should be strengthened as a critical way to improve the efficiency of programs combating land degradation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aafforestation 3aecological restoration 3aeconometrics 3aland degradation 3aland use 3alandscapes 3amodels 3asediment contamination 3asoil erosion 3atopsoil 3atransportation 3avegetation cover 3awater conservation 3aChina 0aLandscape metric 0aSpatial econometric model 0aLoess plateau1 aZhao, Lingling1 aDai, Jialing1 aLiu, Haimeng1 aLi, Zhouyuan1 aWang, Xinchi1 aYang, Zhiyuan1 aZhang, Haiyan1 aWen, Meili1 aWang, Jun0 tJournal of arid environments.g2020 Dec., v. 183 p.104255-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl11719x0140-19637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jaridenv.2020.1042553Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02352naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245010200169520105900271592002801330650001601358650001501374650002201389650001801411650002901429650001901458650001501477650000901492650001301501650001301514650001601527653001401543653001901557653001801576653001401594653002101608700006901629700001901698773011801717856008601835852000901921655001201930IND60695400320221120103908.0211227e20200815xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069540032DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jenvman.2020.1106882doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPanahi, Shima10aAssessment of milkweed floss as a natural hollow oleophilic fibrous sorbent for oil spill cleanup  aNatural oil sorbent materials with a high oil sorption capacity have recently received remarkable attention for oil spill cleanup from seawater. This study reports on the development of a superhydrophobic hollow cellulosic fiber that could serve as an oil spill cleanup material. As oil sorption is based on the physical and chemical characteristics of the sorbent, FTIR, SEM, XRD, and surface contact angle of the fibers were determined. A series of tests were then carried out to analyze the sorption capacity, dynamic oil retention, and reusability. Subsequently, the effect of the fibers’ weight on the amount of oil absorption and absorption time was investigated. The wettability analyses showed that the milkweed floss fiber possessed a superhydrophobic characteristic (with the water contact angle of 140°). The empty channel of the fiber was more than 90% of its total volume. The hydrophobicity and capillary properties helped the fibers to absorb up to 100 g/g of oil, which was higher than that obtained by many natural cellulosic fibers.  aPublisher supplied data 3aApocynaceae 3aabsorption 3acellulosic fibers 3acontact angle 3aenvironmental management 3ahydrophobicity 3aoil spills 3aoils 3aseawater 3asorbents 3awettability 0aCapillary 0aMilkweed fiber 0aOil pollution 0aTurbidity 0aWetting behavior1 aMoghaddam, Meghdad Kamali1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0510-10091 aMoezzi, Meysam0 tJournal of environmental management.g2020 Aug. 15, v. 268 p.110688-dElsevier LtdwJournal:2018x0301-47977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2020.1106883Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03460naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002300094040001800117100002400135245012500159300001500284520199700299592002802296650001102324650001702335650002002352650003002372650001602402650001002418650001902428650001202447650001202459650001402471650001502485650002802500650001502528650001702543650003502560700001802595700001902613700001802632700002702650773015202677856007002829856009402899852000902993655001203002IND60785863620221117163835.0220729e20200829xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078586362DNAL7 a10.3791/616552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPennarossa, Georgia12aA two-step strategy that combines epigenetic modification and biomechanical cues to generate mammalian pluripotent cells  ap. e61655.  aCell phenotype can be reversed or modified with different methods, with advantages and limitations that are specific for each technique. Here we describe a new strategy that combines the use of chemical epigenetic erasing with mechanosensing-related cues, to generate mammalian pluripotent cells. Two main steps are required. In the first step, adult mature (terminally differentiated) cells are exposed to the epigenetic eraser 5-aza-cytidine to drive them into a pluripotent state. This part of the protocol was developed, based on the increasing understanding of the epigenetic mechanisms controlling cell fate and differentiation, and involves the use of the epigenetic modifier to erase cell differentiated state and then drive into a transient high plasticity window. In the second step, erased cells are encapsulated in polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) micro-bioreactors, also known as Liquid Marbles, to promote 3D cell rearrangement to extend and stably maintain the acquired high plasticity. PTFE is a non-reactive hydrophobic synthetic compound and its use permits the creation of a cellular microenvironment, which cannot be achieved in traditional 2D culture systems. This system encourages and boosts the maintenance of pluripotency though bio-mechanosensing-related cues. The technical procedures described here are simple strategies to allow for the induction and maintenance of a high plasticity state in adult somatic cells. The protocol allowed the derivation of high plasticity cells in all mammalian species tested. Since it does not involve the use of gene transfection and is free of viral vectors, it may represent a notable technological advance for translational medicine applications. Furthermore, the micro-bioreactor system provides a notable advancement in stem cell organoid technology by in vitro re-creating a specific micro-environment that allows for the long-term culture of high plasticity cells, namely as ESCs, iPSCs, epigenetically erased cells and MSCs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadults 3abiomechanics 3acell structures 3acellular microenvironment 3aepigenetics 3agenes 3ahydrophobicity 3aliquids 3amammals 3aorganoids 3aplasticity 3apolytetrafluoroethylene 3astem cells 3atransfection 3atranslational medical research1 aLedda, Sergio1 aArcuri, Sharon1 aGandolfi, F.,1 aBrevini, Tiziana A.

However, there remains a poor understanding of how this alteration affects the distribution of fluids over the pore and pore-network scale and how this wetting alteration leads to oil recovery. In this work, we observe how oil and brine redistribute in the pores of rocks in response to low-salinity flooding. We use X-ray μ-CT scanning to image tertiary low-salinity waterflooding in two Berea sandstone cores. The wetting state of one core is altered with exposure to crude oil. We characterize the wetting state of both samples using imagery of fluid–solid fractional wetting and pore occupancy analysis. In the unaltered rock, oil saturation, fractional mineral area covered by oil, and size distribution of oil-filled pores remain constant between high-salinity flooding and subsequent low-salinity floods. In contrast, in the altered sample, we observe a shift in the mineral area covered by oil after low-salinity flooding toward decreasing coverage, consistent with a change to a less oil-wetting state. This change is also reflected in the observed variation in fluid pore occupancy. The wetting alteration results in the redistribution of 22% of oil within the rock, but an additional recovery of just three percentage points. The success of low-salinity waterflooding depends on both a wetting alteration and a pore structure, which facilitates the production of mobilized oil.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-radiation 3aenergy 3aoils 3apetroleum 3asalinity 3asandstone1 aMuggeridge, Ann1 aGarfi, Gaetano1 aJones, Alistair1 aKrevor, Samuel0 tEnergy & fuels.g2021 Jan. 06, v. 35, no. 2 p.1197-1207dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23338x1520-50297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.energyfuels.0c032993Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02349naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100006300142245007100205300001800276500002000294520107200314592002801386596006701414596004801481650001101529650001501540650001301555650001301568700002201581700006001603700006201663700005601725773013201781856007701913852000901990655001201999IND60789653220221120060750.0220822e201811  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078965322DNAL7 a10.1029/2018JC0142382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aArzeno, Isabella B.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2518-723313aAn Alongshore Momentum Budget Over a Fringing Tropical Fore‐Reef  ap. 7839-7855.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aExisting momentum budgets over coral reefs have predominantly focused on cross‐reef dynamics, lacking analysis of alongshore processes. To complement existing cross‐reef research and enhance our understanding of forcing variability at the semidiurnal period, this study examines the σ–coordinate, depth‐averaged alongshore momentum budget over a fore‐reef as a function of tidal phase. The observations were gathered over a 3‐week timespan, between the 12‐ and 20‐m isobaths of a Hawaiian fringing reef system, focusing on two moorings on the 12‐m isobath, where median drag coefficients estimated from log fits are CD=0.0080[−0.002,+0.004] and CD=0.0023[−0.0006,+0.0009]. Analysis at one location shows that the unsteadiness, barotropic pressure gradient, and bottom drag are equally important, and their combination is sufficient to close the momentum budget. However, bottom drag is less important at the second mooring; the difference between unsteadiness and pressure gradient suggests that advective acceleration plays a significant role.  aPublisher supplied data  cDoD Air Force Office of Scientific Research (NDSEG fellowship)  aN00014-13-1-0340.cOffice of Naval Research 3acorals 3ageophysics 3amomentum 3aresearch1 aCollignon, Audric1 aMerrifield, Mark1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5026-83931 aGiddings, Sarah N.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0726-47811 aPawlak, Geno1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3718-18800 tJournal of geophysical research.g2018 Nov., v. 123, no. 11 p.7839-7855dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:27942x2169-92757nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2018JC0142383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02657naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002400150245007100174520137900245592002801624650001801652650002401670650001301694650002001707650001801727650001101745650003201756650002801788650001201816650002601828650001301854650001501867650001601882650001401898650001201912650000901924653001801933653001401951653001301965653001501978653002101993773009102014856008502105852000902190655001202199IND60776564920221122213029.0220815e202209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077656492DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fooweb.2022.e002402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAmiri-Jami, Alireza10aEffect of ant-attendance on the occurrence of intraguild predation  aParasitoids and predators exploiting similar food resource make aphidophagous guilds especially favourable systems for studying intraguild predation, but ants as third parties protect aphids against their natural enemies and in return obtain carbohydrate-rich honeydew as a nutritional resource. A field experiment on the interrelationship among aphids, ants and predators/parasitoids was conducted on two plants (hoary cress Cardaria draba L. [Brassicaceae) and Canada thistle Cirsium arvense L. [Asteraceae]). Cardaria was infested with the aphid Acyrthosiphon gossypii Mordvilko (Homoptera: Aphididae) tended by the ant Lasius turcicus Santschi (Hymenoptera: Formicidae). Cirsium was infested with the aphid Brachycaudus cardui L. (Homoptera: Aphididae) tended by the ant Crematogaster sordidula Nylander (Hymenoptera: Formicidae). The mean number of predators per aphid colony decreased significantly when the aphids were tended by ants on both host plants. In contrast, the parasitism rate of both aphids decreased significantly without the tending ant. Thus ant attendance can affect the occurrence and intensity of intraguild predation, and consequently provide enemy free space for parasitoids. If a foraging female aphid parasitoid succeeds in ovipositing into patches with guarding ants, then its offspring could be protected from the risk of intraguild predation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcyrthosiphon 3aBrachycaudus cardui 3aCardaria 3aCirsium arvense 3aCrematogaster 3aLasius 3aLepidium draba subsp. draba 3aaphidophagous predators 3afemales 3afield experimentation 3ahoneydew 3aparasitism 3aparasitoids 3apredation 3aprogeny 3arisk 0aAphidophagous 0aMutualism 0aPredator 0aParasitoid 0aEnemy-free space0 tFood webs.g2022 Sept., v. 32 p.e00240-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:23213x2352-24967nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fooweb.2022.e002403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01360naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002200140245007800162300001800240520039600258592002800654650001600682650002300698650001200721650001100733700002400744700002000768700002200788700002000810773013300830856007400963852000901037655001201046IND60617477920221118095506.0181025e20180306xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061747792DNAL7 a10.1039/c8cc00921j2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCarbonnel, Elodie13aAn electrophilic reagent for the synthesis of OCHFMe-containing molecules  ap. 2491-2493.  aHerein the synthesis of a novel and bench stable electrophilic reagent to construct the OCFHMe motif from O-nucleophiles has been described.

Neuronal circuit strength is related to synaptic density, and the breakdown of synapses is characteristic of disease states like major depressive disorder (MDD) and Alzheimer's disease. Traditional techniques to investigate synapse numbers include genetic expression of fluorescent markers (e.g., green fluorescent protein (GFP)), dyes that fill a neuron (e.g., carbocyanine dye, DiI), and immunofluorescent detection of spine markers (e.g., postsynaptic density 95 (PSD95)). A major caveat to these proxy techniques is that they only identify postsynaptic changes. Yet, a synapse is a connection between a presynaptic terminal and a postsynaptic spine. The gold standard for measuring synapse formation/elimination requires time-consuming electron microscopy or array tomography techniques. These techniques require specialized training and costly equipment. Further, only a limited number of neurons can be assessed and are used to represent changes to an entire brain region. DetectSyn is a rapid fluorescent technique that identifies changes to synapse formation or elimination due to a disease state or drug activity. DetectSyn utilizes a rapid proximity ligation assay to detect juxtaposed pre- and postsynaptic proteins and standard fluorescent microscopy, a technique readily available to most laboratories. Fluorescent detection of the resulting puncta allows for quick and unbiased analysis of experiments. DetectSyn provides more representative results than electron microscopy because larger areas can be analyzed than a limited number of fluorescent neurons. Moreover, DetectSyn works for in vitro cultured neurons and fixed tissue slices. Finally, a method is provided to analyze the data collected from this technique. Overall, DetectSyn offers a procedure for detecting relative changes in synapse density across treatments or disease states and is more accessible than traditional techniques.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAlzheimer disease 3abrain 3adrugs 3adyes 3aelectron microscopy 3aequipment 3afluorescence 3afluorescence microscopy 3agreen fluorescent protein 3amental depression 3aneurons 3asynapse 3atomography1 aMcArdle, Colin J.1 aRaab-Graham, Kimberly F.0 tJournal of visualized experiments.g2022 July 22, , no. 185 p.e63139-e63139dJournal of Visualized ExperimentswJournal:jnl4469330x1940-087X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3791/631393Available from publisher's site  uhttp://www.jove.com/video/63139/detectsyn-rapid-unbiased-fluorescent-method-to-detect-changes-synapse  aDNAL 7aarticle02026naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245010700158300001800265520074700283592002801030650002001058650002301078650001701101650001501118650001401133650001501147650002201162650002701184650001301211650002601224700001501250700001401265700001201279700001501291700001401306700001801320700001701338700002001355773013401375856007401509852000901583655001201592IND60617478020221118095538.0181025e20180322xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061747802DNAL7 a10.1039/c8cc00931g2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Huimeng12aA black phosphorus nanosheet-based siRNA delivery system for synergistic photothermal and gene therapy  ap. 3142-3145.  aGene therapy with small interfering RNA (siRNA) has been proved to be a promising technology to treat various diseases by hampering the production of target proteins.

Three strengthening strategies of grain boundary hardening, age hardening and hardening by CNTs are employed. First, grain size of A2024 is effectively reduced using a ball-milling technique and A2024 with a grain size of 100nm exhibits a yield stress of ∼560MPa, exhibiting a well agreement with the Hall–Petch relation. CNTs also have a great effect for strengthening. The A2024 matrix composite containing 3vol.% CNTs shows a yield stress of ∼780MPa with 2% tensile elongation to failure. Hardness is further increased after aging. The nanostructured composite shows its peak hardness after 4h of aging because the refined grain boundaries and CNTs act as a pathway for diffusion of atoms with stimulating the aging process. The composite in the present study has great potential for application as structural materials in industry.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalloys 3aaluminum 3acarbon nanotubes 3ahardness 3aindustry 3arefined grains1 aMin, B.H.1 aShin, J.H.1 aBae, D.H.0 tComposites.g2011 Oct., v. 42, no. 10 p.1438-1444dElsevier Ltdx1359-835X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.compositesa.2011.06.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03545naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100005200142245016500194300001800359500002000377520164700397592002802044596007702072596008602149596008402235596003602319596006202355596006202417596006202479596008302541650001002624650001402634650001102648650001502659650001302674650001302687650002302700650001102723650003002734700005502764700005002819773013202869856007703001852000903078655001203087IND60789653820221120051251.0220822e201812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078965382DNAL7 a10.1029/2018JC0141392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGeng, Yu1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4350-072110aEffect of the Decadal Kuroshio Extension Variability on the Seasonal Changes of the Mixed‐Layer Salinity Anomalies in the Kuroshio‐Oyashio Confluence Region  ap. 8849-8861.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThis study investigates the seasonal variations of the mixed‐layer salinity anomalies (MLSAs) under the decadal variability of the Kuroshio Extension (KE) in the Kuroshio‐Oyashio Confluence Region (KOCR: 35–40°N, 140–150°E). Our analysis reveals that the seasonal variation trend of the MLSA is almost opposite in the stable and unstable states of the KE. In the stable (unstable) state, the increasing (decreasing) MLSA in the KOCR reaches its maximal positive (minimal negative) value in late summer and then decreases (increases) gradually. An exploration of the budget of the MLSA shows that ocean dynamics explain more than half of the seasonal MLSA changes in the two states and exceed the contribution of atmospheric forcing (approximately 18%). The leading oceanic processes include advection of the mean mixed‐layer salinity by anomalous Ekman and geostrophic currents and advection of the MLSA by mean geostrophic currents, which explain 13.80%, 12.90%, and 20.73% (11.59%, 13.36%, and 24.90%) of the MLSA temporal changes in the stable (unstable) states, respectively. The difference in the MLSA between the two states is primarily derived from the discrepancies in the anomalous ocean currents in the KOCR and south of Japan, salinity anomalies in the south of Japan, and sea surface temperature anomalies affecting atmospheric forcing between the two modes of the KE. Moreover, the most apparent influences are concentrated in summer and early autumn because of the shallower mixed layer in terms of atmospheric forcing and obvious velocity changes and the distribution of climatological salinity for ocean processes.  aPublisher supplied data  aU1606402cNSFC‐Shandong Joint Fund for Marine Science Research Centers  aGASI‐IPOVAI‐06cNational Programme on Global Change and Air‐Sea Interaction  aXDA20060502cStrategic Priority Research Program of Chinese Academy of Sciences  a41421005cNSFC Innovative Group  a41490640cNational Natural Scientific Foundation of China  a41490644cNational Natural Scientific Foundation of China  a41576015cNational Natural Scientific Foundation of China  aQNLM2016ORP0107cQingdao National Laboratory for Marine Science and Technology 3aJapan 3aadvection 3aautumn 3ageophysics 3aresearch 3asalinity 3aseasonal variation 3asummer 3asurface water temperature1 aWang, Qiang1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1485-97401 aMu, Mu1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7174-817X0 tJournal of geophysical research.g2018 Dec., v. 123, no. 12 p.8849-8861dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:27942x2169-92757nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2018JC0141393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03846naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245008200169520247700251592002802728650002402756650001402780650001102794650001702805650002302822650001302845650002202858650001602880650001402896650001102910650001002921650002702931650001602958650002502974651001502999651003103014651002703045653002403072653002003096653002003116700002103136700001703157773011103174856008203285852000903367655001203376IND60782050520221120085828.0220921e202210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078205052DNAL7 a10.1016/j.rse.2022.1131472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNi-Meister, Wenge10aDirect use of large-footprint lidar waveforms to estimate aboveground biomass  aMany studies have established the strong connections between aboveground biomass and lidar height metrics; however, these relationships are site-specific. Field data required to derive these relationships are not readily available in many cases. We developed a model to estimate plot-level aboveground biomass density (AGBD) directly from large-footprint lidar waveform measurements. An individual tree-based aboveground biomass (AGB)-height allometric relationship was scaled up to the plot level using lidar-waveform sensed tree height and crown size distribution characteristics. The AGBD was estimated based on a waveform/foliage profile-weighted height-based allometric equation. The AGBD-height scaling exponent was then built on the allometric relationships of tree height with stem diameter and crown volume with tree height. Global vegetation structure data analysis demonstrated that one general model (scaling exponent ~ 1.6–1.8) works reasonably well across all global forest biomes except boreal forests (scaling exponent ~ 0.9). We applied the model to estimate aboveground biomass in two distinct geographic regions: temperate deciduous/conifer forests in the northeastern USA and a montane conifer forest in Sierra National Forest in California. Local vegetation structural data analysis leads to a consistent height scaling exponent for these two distinct biomes, slightly different from the global data analysis results. This model produced optimal AGBD estimates using the local height scaling exponent value. Adequate AGBD estimates with the general height scaling exponent value were also provided by our model. Our analysis suggests one general allometric relationship between plot-level AGBD and large-footprint lidar waveforms. Integrating local structure allometric relationships improve the predictive accuracy of the model. Our model outperformed the lidar height metrics-based approach for AGBD estimates and overcame the biomass underestimation problem using height metrics for high biomass regions. This model could potentially serve as a general and robust model for monitoring forest carbon stocks using large-footprint lidar waveform measurements such as the Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) mission at the continental and global scales. The model could be a framework for integrating a demography-based terrestrial ecosystem model and GEDI global mission measurements to improve global carbon stock and flux estimates.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaboveground biomass 3aallometry 3acarbon 3acarbon sinks 3aconiferous forests 3aconifers 3aecological models 3aenvironment 3aequations 3aleaves 3alidar 3aterrestrial ecosystems 3atree height 3avegetation structure 3aCalifornia 3aNortheastern United States 3aSierra National Forest 0aAboveground biomass 0aBiomass indices 0aLidar waveforms1 aRojas, Alejandro1 aLee, Shihyan0 tRemote sensing of environment.g2022 Oct., v. 280 p.113147-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11735x0034-42577nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rse.2022.1131473Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03666naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001400149245024200163506011700405506007600522520180500598592002802403506003702431650002702468650001602495650002202511650002002533650001502553650002102568650002002589650001602609650001702625650001402642650002102656650002902677650002502706650001502731650000902746650001602755653002802771653002402799653002102823653002102844653002402865700001902889700002002908700001502928773010002943856008403043852000903127655001203136IND60776565420221207060750.0220809e202206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077656542DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aqrep.2022.1011502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, June10aEvaluating the efficacy of partially substituting fish meal with unfermented tuna by-product meal in diets on the growth, feed utilization, chemical composition and non-specific immune responses of olive flounder (Paralichthys olivaceus)  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aFish meal (FM) usage in aquafeed is fraught with cost and environmental challenges. Alternatives to FM must be readily available and with adequate protein. This 8-weeks study explored the utilization of tuna by-product meal (TBM) without fermentation as a substitute for FM in diet on growth, feed utilization, chemical composition, plasma chemistry, and non-immune responses of olive flounder (Paralichthys olivaceus). Four hundred juveniles (initial weight of 14.7 g) were randomly distributed to 20 tanks (20 fish per tank). The control (Con) diet contained 65% FM without replacement, and in the TBM10, TBM20, TBM30, TBM40, and TBM50 diets, FM was substituted with 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, and 50% TBM, respectively. Each diet was fed to triplicate groups of fish, but quadruplicate groups for the Con and TBM30 diets. Survival was not different among the experimental diets. Superior weight gain, specific growth rate (SGR), feed efficiency ratio (FER) and protein efficiency ratio were observed in fish fed the TBM40 and TBM50 diets to fish fed all other diets. Condition factor of fish fed the TBM40 and TBM50 diets was higher than that of fish fed the Con diet. Feed consumption, chemical composition, and amino acid profiles of the whole body fish, except for the tryptophan content, viscerosomatic and hepatosomatic indices, plasma biochemical parameters, non-specific immune responses were not affected by the experimental diets. In conclusion, FM up to 50% can be replaced with TBM without impairing growth, feed utilization, nutritional composition, plasma chemistry, and non-specific immune responses of olive flounder when 65% FM was included. The greatest weight gain, SGR, and FER of fish were estimated to be 47.1%, 48.6%, and 46.3% of dietary substitution of FM with TBM, respectively.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aParalichthys olivaceus 3aaquaculture 3aaquaculture feeds 3ablood chemistry 3abyproducts 3acondition factor 3afeed conversion 3afeed intake 3afermentation 3afish meal 3anutrient content 3aprotein efficiency ratio 3aspecific growth rate 3atryptophan 3atuna 3aweight gain 0aFishery by-product meal 0aProtein replacement 0aFeed consumption 0aCondition factor 0aAmino acid profiles1 aBaek, Seong II1 aCho, Sung Hwoan1 aKim, Taeho0 tAquaculture reports.g2022 June, v. 24 p.101150-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23215x2352-51347nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aqrep.2022.1011503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02116naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245013900157300001800296520077100314592002801085650001701113650002401130650001101154650001201165650002401177650001101201650002501212650001701237650001601254650001101270650001401281700001701295700001901312700001601331700001801347700001901365700001401384700001501398700001601413700001701429773012901446856007401575852000901649655001201658IND60624033520221121025913.0181130e20181129xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062403352DNAL7 a10.1039/c8ay01920g2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Mingdi12aA unique bifunctional probe for detecting silicate anions and cupric cations: the modified silica nanoparticles and their coordination  ap. 5480-5485.  aNovel triphenylamine (TPA)-based derivative L, which shows strong affinity for SiO₃²⁻ and fluorometric detection of Cu²⁺ over other anions or cations, has been synthesized by simple steps.

Serum amyloid A (SAA) and haptoglobin (Hp) are APPs that are produced during inflammation, and likely play a role in host immunological defence against Eimeria infection and the associated intestinal tissue damage. We investigated the involvement of SAA and HP in an experimental study, including three groups of calves: a control group (group 0, n=11), and two groups infected with either 150,000 or 250,000 Eimeria zuernii oocysts (group 1 (n=11) and group 2 (n=12), respectively). The calves were monitored for 28 days and data was collected on oocyst excretion, faecal score, animal weight, and SAA and Hp serum concentrations. Generalized linear mixed models showed that the clinical symptoms, indicated by an increase in the number of oocysts in the faeces and severe diarrhoea, manifested at patency for group 1 and 2. Serum Hp and SAA levels also increased during this period. Hp appeared to be a more sensitive marker than SAA, and differences between groups 1 and 2 were observed only for Hp. Linear regression models showed a negative association between weight gain and Hp concentrations, calculated as the area under the curve (AUC) during the overall experimental period and the patency period. A similar result was seen for SAA only during the patency period. This result supports the assumption that reduced weight gain due to E. zuernii infection is an immunologically driven process that involves an increase in APPs. A random intercept regression model of oocyst shedding groups showed that calves shedding 1–500 oocysts had reduced concentrations of Hp, indicating that a different immunological reaction occurs during mild shedding of E. zuernii oocysts than during more intensive shedding. A similar model was used to examine associations between faecal scores and Hp concentrations for each group. Group 2 calves with haemorrhagic diarrhoea displayed higher Hp levels than calves in that group with lower faecal scores, which may be in response to an increased demand for Hp in the repair process as a result of haemolysis. APPs seem to play an important role in determining the course of E. zuernii infection in calves, which may enhance our understanding of the immunological reaction and development of this disease.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aEimeria zuernii 3aacute phase proteins 3aamyloid 3ablood serum 3acalves 3acattle diseases 3adata collection 3adiarrhea 3aexcretion 3afeces 3ahaptoglobins 3ahemolysis 3aimmunity 3ainflammation 3aintestines 3alinear models 3aoocysts 3aregression analysis 3aweight gain 0aAcute phase proteins 0aEimeria zuernii 0aCoccidiosis 0aInflammation 0aCalves 0aImmunology1 aBangoura, Berit1 aLepik, Triin1 aOrro, Toomas0 tVeterinary parasitology.g2015 Sept. 15, v. 212, no. 3-4 p.140-146dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl11815x0304-40177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetpar.2015.06.0243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02846naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001500147245010500162500002200267506011700289506007600406520127700482592002801759506003701787650001301824650001101837650001301848650004101861650002301902650001901925650001001944650003201954653002501986653002202011653004202033653002402075700001802099700001502117700001402132700001802146700001802164700001702182773012002199856004802319852000902367655001202376IND60795328320221207050347.0221004e20220926xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079532832DNAL7 a10.1016/j.lwt.2022.1140412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJiang, Hao10aHS-SPME-GC-MS and OAV analyses of characteristic volatile flavour compounds in salt-baked drumstick.  aPre-press version  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aSalt-baked drumstick of chicken is a traditional Cantonese food, but the flavour components remain vague. In this research, the volatile flavour compounds of salt-baked drumsticks were explored by headspace solid-phase microextraction (HS-SPME) combining gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The result showed that 56 flavour compounds, 67flavour compounds and 62 flavour compounds were detected by the commercial water-baked drumsticks, the commercial salt-baked drumsticks and the self-manufactured salt-baked drumsticks, respectively. Then the combination of aroma threshold and odor activity value (OAV) theory further identified the flavour substances. Results showed that 19 volatile components were the main source of aroma, including aldehydes (9), alcohols (4), heterocycles (3), an ester compound, a phenolic compound and a hydrocarbon compound. There were 8 odorants with OAVs ≥10 in the drumsticks heating by salt, including octyl aldehyde, nonyl aldehyde, furfural, trans-2-nonenal, (E,E)-2,4-nonadienal, (E,E)-2,4-heptadienal, 1-octene-3-ol and ethyl cinnamate. This research identified major components of salt-baked drumstick during processing, which provided a foundation for further research on its formation mechanism and influence mechanism.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3achickens 3aflavor 3afurfural 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3aheadspace analysis 3aodor compounds 3aodors 3asolid phase microextraction 0aSalt-baked drumstick 0aFlavour substance 0aHeadspace solid-phase microextraction 0aOdor activity value1 aZhang, Mutang1 aYe, Junjie1 aQian, Min1 aLi, Xiangluan1 aZhao, Wenhong1 aBai, Weidong0 tLebensmittel-Wissenschaft + Technologie.g2022 Sept. 26,  p.114041-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl1644x0023-64387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lwt.2022.114041  aDNAL 7aarticle02224naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002100146245009200167300001600259520088500275592002801160650002801188650001701216650000901233650002401242650001301266650001601279650001601295650001301311650001601324650002101340650002301361653001701384653002801401653002201429653001601451653001601467653001001483700001901493700001201512700002401524773012901548856008001677852000901757655001201766IND60622098820221121223612.0181123e201210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062209882DNAL7 a10.1177/10820132114282362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSatindara Kaura,10aOptimization of process for reduction of antinutritional factors in edible cereal brans  ap. 445-454.  aReduction of various antinutritional factors in cereal brans by different treatments (microwave heating, dry heating and wet heating) were studied. There was significant difference (p ≤ 0.05) in reduction of antinutritional factors of treated cereal brans except for dry heating at low temperature. Microwave heating at 2450 MHz for 2.5 min resulted in 53.85%, 57.21%, 65.00% and 100% reduction in phytic acid, polyphenols, oxalates and saponins, respectively. Wet heating resulted in maximum reduction in trypsin inhibitor activity (83.07%) at 110 °C for 25 min. Processing treatment resulted in increase in bulk density and slight darkening of the brans. The most effective method of detoxifying most of the toxicants was microwave heating for 2.5 min, and therefore it could be exploited for making treated brans an ideal source for potential food application.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantinutritional factors 3abulk density 3aheat 3amicrowave treatment 3aoxalates 3aphytic acid 3apolyphenols 3asaponins 3atemperature 3atoxic substances 3atrypsin inhibitors 0aCereal brans 0aantinutritional factors 0amicrowave heating 0awet heating 0adry heating 0acolor1 aSharma, Savita1 aDar, BN1 aBalajīta Siṅgha,0 tFood science and technology international.g, v. 18, no. 5 p.445-454dSAGE PublicationswJournal:jnl3949853x1082-01327nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/10820132114282363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02937naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245010000169300001600269500001500285520151400300592002801814650001601842650001701858650002601875650001301901650003001914650002401944650001301968650001401981650001601995650001702011650000702028650001602035650001202051650003302063650001902096650002002115650002102135650001202156653002002168653001002188700002002198700001802218773011402236856008402350852000902434655001202443IND60112755720221117162353.0141111e201110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011275572DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jbiosc.2011.06.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Guan-Jie10aCloning and expression of hydroxynitrile lyase gene from Eriobotrya japonica in Pichia pastoris  ap. 321-325.  a2019-12-04  aHydroxynitrile lyase gene (hnl) from Eriobotrya japonica was successfully amplified using the method of SEFA PCR (Self-Formed Adaptor PCR). The complete sequence was 5.5kbp in length, including 3100bp of the upstream promoter region, 1659bp of the coding sequence, three introns and 315bp of the downstream transcription terminator. The phylogenetic analysis illustrated that the obtained hnl exhibited 66–70% identity to the reported isozymes from almond, black cherry and Japanese apricot. The EjHNL had 552 amino acids including a 25 amino acid-long signal peptide. The conserved characteristic structures of HNLs, such as FAD-binding motif, N-glycosylation sites and active sites were observed. The coding sequence of the hnl was inserted into pPIC9K vector for heterologous expression in Pichia pastoris. The HNL activity of the culture supernatant reached 15U/ml after 96h of induction by methanol. The specific activity of the recombinant HNL was about 197U/mg. The enantiomeric excess value of the product R-mandelonitrile attained 98.6% and the value of Kₘ of the recombinant HNL was determined to be 0.47mM based on the kinetic data. The optimum temperature and pH of the recombinant HNL were 40°C and 6.0 respectively. The experimental data indicated that the obtained recombinant HNL showed similar catalytic characteristics with the natural EjHNL. The expression of the recombinant HNL in P. pastoris could present another available biocatalyst for the synthesis of R-selective cyanohydrins.  aPublisher supplied data 3atemperature 3abiocatalysts 3aKomagataella pastoris 3amethanol 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aEriobotrya japonica 3aisozymes 3aphylogeny 3aamino acids 3aactive sites 3apH 3aPrunus mume 3aalmonds 3aheterologous gene expression 3asignal peptide 3aPrunus serotina 3apromoter regions 3aintrons 0aPichia pastoris 0agenes1 aYang, Zhi-Qiang1 aGuo, Yang-Hao0 tJournal of bioscience and bioengineering.g2011 Oct., v. 112, no. 4 p.321-325dElsevier B.V.x1389-17237nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jbiosc.2011.06.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02146naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001500140245007500155520120000230592002801430650001601458650003501474650002901509700001701538700002001555700001801575700001901593700001901612773012901631856007501760852000901835655001201844IND60757953920221119140911.0211125e20211109xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075795392DNAL7 a10.3390/rs132245002doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHe, Yixin 12aA RFID-Integrated Framework for Tag Anti-Collision in UAV-Aided VANETs  aIn this paper, we investigate tags in anti-collision applications of radio frequency identification (RFID) technology in unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-aided vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs). The integration of RFID technology in UAV-aided VANETs can provide reliable traffic-related services for vehicles. However, multiple tags’ simultaneous responses to a reader mounted on a UAV, denoted as tag collision, gravely affect the correct tag detection on each vehicle. Therefore, in order to decrease the collision probability and improve the throughput, we propose a multi-frequency tag identification method. In the proposed scheme, we devise a tag grouping method based on adaptive power control to make the reader dynamically match the optimal frame length. Based on the above matching results, we introduce a tag estimation method using the optimal weight to improve the accuracy of tag estimation. We theoretically analyze the closed-form expression of the security outage probability expression. Finally, our simulation results demonstrate that the proposed tag anti-collision scheme achieved significant performance superiority in terms of the throughput and identification time slots.  aPublisher supplied data 3aprobability 3aradio frequency identification 3aunmanned aerial vehicles1 aWang, Dawei 1 aHuang, Fanghui 1 aZhang, Yufei 1 aZhang, Ruonan 1 aYan, Xiaohong 0 tRemote Sensing.g2021 Nov. 09, v. 13, no. 22dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:26717x2072-42927nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs132245003Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03291naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001900139245007600158300001600234500002000250520186900270592002802139650002202167650001302189650001102202650001902213650001902232650002102251650002202272650001302294650001802307650001902325650001602344650001202360700006502372700002702437700002202464700002202486700002702508700006102535700002302596773013202619856007302751852000902824655001202833IND60688753420221120094434.0200416e202004  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068875342DNAL7 a10.1111/rda.136482doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPagano, Nunzia10aEffect of caspase inhibitor Z‐VAD‐FMK on bovine sperm cryotolerance  ap. 530-536.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe aim of this study was to evaluate the treatment of bovine semen with the pan‐caspase inhibitor benzyloxycarbonyl‐Val‐Ala‐Asp‐fluoromethyl ketone (Z‐VAD‐FMK), before or after freezing on semen quality. After the initial assessment, sperm from 4 bulls were pooled (Experiment 1) and cryopreserved in BioXcell containing 0, 20 and 100 μM Z‐VAD‐FMK. After thawing semen viability, motility, membrane integrity, as well as DNA fragmentation and ΔΨm were evaluated. In Experiment 2, bovine frozen/thawed sperm were incubated for 1 hr with 0, 20 and 100 µM Z‐VAD‐FMK before assessing the semen quality. The treatment with Z ‐VAD‐FMK before cryopreservation improved post‐thawing sperm motility compared to the control group (p < .05), while no differences were recorded in sperm viability and membrane integrity among groups (on average 86.8 ± 1.5 and 69.1 ± 1.4, respectively). Interestingly, at the highest concentration, DNA fragmentation decreased (p < .05), while the percentage of spermatozoa with high ΔΨm increased (p < .05). The results of Experiment 2 showed that 1‐hr treatment with Z‐VAD‐FMK did not affect sperm motility and viability (on average 63.4 ± 5.8 and 83.7.1 ± 1.2, respectively). However, Z‐VAD‐FMK improved sperm membrane integrity (p < .05) and at the highest concentration tested decreased the proportion of sperm showing DNA fragmentation (p < .05). No differences were recorded in the percentage of spermatozoa with high ΔΨm (on average 57.0 ± 11.4). In conclusion, the treatment with 100 µM of the caspase inhibitor Z‐VAD‐FMK before freezing increased bovine sperm mass motility and ΔΨm, while decreasing sperm DNA fragmentation. Treatment of semen after thawing with 100 µM Z‐VAD‐FMK improved sperm membrane integrity and reduced DNA fragmentation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA fragmentation 3acaspases 3acattle 3acell viability 3acold tolerance 3acryopreservation 3aenzyme inhibitors 3afreezing 3asemen quality 3asperm motility 3aspermatozoa 3athawing1 aLongobardi, Valentina1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6560-35721 aDe Canditiis, Carolina1 aZuchegna, Candida1 aRomano, Antonella1 aMichal Andrzej, Kosior1 aPero, Maria Elena1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7262-63501 aGasparrini, Bianca0 tReproduction in domestic animals.g2020 Apr., v. 55, no. 4 p.530-536dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl44391x0936-67687nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/rda.136483Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02914naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001700143245016200160520176600322592002802088650002502116650000802141650001702149650001402166650001802180650001002198650002002208650001902228650002202247700001802269700002202287700001802309700001802327773012002345856007802465852000902543655001202552IND60794194420221117095240.0220922e20220909xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079419442DNAL7 a10.3390/genes130916202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Haoqi 10aEvaluation of Intracellular Gene Transfers from Plastome to Nuclear Genome across Progressively Improved Assemblies for Arabidopsis thaliana and Oryza sativa  aDNA originating from organellar genomes are regularly discovered in nuclear sequences during genome assembly. Nevertheless, such insertions are sometimes omitted during the process of nuclear genome assembly because the inserted DNA is assigned to organellar genomes, leading to a systematic underestimation of their frequency. With the rapid development of high-throughput sequencing technology, more inserted fragments from organelle genomes can now be detected. Therefore, it is necessary to be aware of the insertion events from organellar genomes during nuclear genome assembly to properly attribute the impact and rate of such insertions in the evolution of nuclear genomes. Here, we investigated the impact of intracellular gene transfer (IGT) from the plastome to the nuclear genome using genome assemblies that were refined through time with technological improvements from two model species, Arabidopsis thaliana and Oryza sativa. We found that IGT from the plastome to the nuclear genome is a dynamic and ongoing process in both A. thaliana and O. sativa, and mostly occurred recently, as the majority of transferred sequences showed over 95% sequence similarity with plastome sequences of origin. Differences in the plastome-to-nuclear genome IGT between A. thaliana and O. sativa varied among the different assembly versions and were associated with the quality of the nuclear genome assembly. IGTs from the plastome to nuclear genome occurred more frequently in intergenic regions, which were often associated with transposable elements (TEs). This study provides new insights into intracellular genome evolution and nuclear genome assembly by characterizing and comparing IGT from the plastome into the nuclear genome for two model plant species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aDNA 3aOryza sativa 3aevolution 3agene transfer 3agenes 3agenome assembly 3anuclear genome 3asequence homology1 aLiao, Xuezhu 1 aTembrock, Luke R.1 aYang, Zuoren 1 aWu, Zhiqiang 0 tGenes.g2022 Sept. 09, v. 13, no. 9dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27140x2073-44257nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/genes130916203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01236naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245013000167300001800297520032800315592002800643650002300671650002300694650001200717700001700729700001800746773010300764856008200867852000900949655001200958IND60628990220221118052912.0190206e20190222xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062899022DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tet.2019.01.0212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Chin-Chau10aGold-catalyzed cyclization of enediynes and arenediynes to 6H-benzo[c]chromen-6-one and dibenzo[c,h]chromen-6-one derivatives  ap. 1034-1043.  aThe efficient synthesis of 6H-benzo[c]chromen-6-one and dibenzo[c,h]chromen-6-one derivatives is described.

Clusters with less than 14 gold atoms adopt a planar structure, whereas larger ones adopt a three-dimensional structure. The CO and O₂ adsorption properties depend strongly on particle structure and size. All of the reaction barriers relevant to CO oxidation display linear scaling relationships with CO and O₂ binding strengths as main reactivity descriptors. Planar and three-dimensional gold clusters exhibit different linear scaling relationship due to different surface topologies and different coordination numbers of the surface atoms. On the basis of these linear scaling relationships, first-principles microkinetics simulations were conducted to determine CO oxidation rates and possible rate-determining step of Au particles. Planar Au₉ and three-dimensional Au₇₉ clusters present the highest CO oxidation rates for planar and three-dimensional clusters, respectively. The planar Au₉ cluster is much more active than the optimum Au₇₉ cluster. A common feature of optimum CO oxidation performance is the intermediate binding strengths of CO and O₂, resulting in intermediate coverages of CO, O₂, and O. Both these optimum particles present lower performance than maximum Sabatier performance, indicating that there is sufficient room for improvement of gold catalysts for CO oxidation.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aadsorption 3acarbon monoxide 3acatalysts 3agold 3aoxidation 3aoxygen 3aparticle size 3atopology1 aFilot, Ivo A.

However, the exact chemical mechanism underlying such detoxication remains unclear. Here, we show that a very fast reaction took place between N-phenylbenzohydroxamic acid (N-PhBHA) and 2,5-dichloro-1,4-benzoquinone (DCBQ), forming an unexpected new carbon–carbon bonding phenyl-quinone product with high yield. In contrast, no reaction was observed with O-benzoyl N-PhBHA. Analogous results were observed for other N-aryl hydroxamic acids and halogenated quinones, which have an ortho-hydrogen adjacent to the reaction site (DCBQ-type). Interestingly, no free radical intermediates could be detected by both ESR spin-trapping and radical-scavenging methods during the reaction process. Taken together, we proposed that nucleophilic substitution followed by an unusual two-step Claisen-type rearrangement reaction was responsible for the formation of a new C–C bonding compound and the detoxication reaction. This represents the first report of an unusually mild and facile two-step Claisen-type rearrangement, which could take place under normal physiological conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLewis bases 3abiomedical research 3acarcinogenicity 3afree radicals 3aorganic chemistry1 aXu, Dan1 aQin, Li1 aLee, Cherie,1 aTang, Tian-Shu1 aZhu, Ben-Zhan1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5484-42900 tJournal of organic chemistry.g2020 Oct. 29, v. 85, no. 23 p.14945-14953dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19181x1520-69047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.joc.0c016753Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04331naa a2200949 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100006400152245008200216300001400298520193600312592002802248650002302276650002402299650001702323650001502340650002002355650001702375650002602392650001502418650001802433650002502451650001402476650004302490650001402533650004402547650001302591650001202604650001802616650002402634653001502658653000802673653000802681653000902689653000802698653001002706653000902716653001002725653000902735653001002744653000802754653000702762653000802769653000902777653000802786653000802794653000802802653000902810653001202819653001002831653001602841653000802857653000802865653001002873653000802883653000802891653000802899653000902907653000702916653000902923653000702932653000802939653001102947653000802958653000702966653000802973653000802981653000902989653001202998653002403010653001803034653002403052653001703076700005503093773012503148856008703273852000903360655001203369IND60628340820221122194945.0190325e201904  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062834082DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jviromet.2019.01.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHamza, Ibrahim Ahmed1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7163-265X10aCritical issues in application of molecular methods to environmental virology  ap. 11-24.  aWaterborne diseases have significant public health and socioeconomic implications worldwide. Many viral pathogens are commonly associated with water-related diseases, namely enteric viruses. Also, novel recently discovered human-associated viruses have been shown to be a causative agent of gastroenteritis or other clinical symptoms. A wide range of analytical methods is available for virus detection in environmental water samples. Viral isolation is historically carried out via propagation on permissive cell lines; however, some enteric viruses are difficult or not able to propagate on existing cell lines. Real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) screening of viral nucleic acid is routinely used to investigate virus contamination in water due to the high sensitivity and specificity. Additionally, the introduction of metagenomic approaches into environmental virology has facilitated the discovery of viruses that cannot be grown in cell culture. This review (i) highlights the applications of molecular techniques in environmental virology such as PCR and its modifications to overcome the critical issues associated with the inability to discriminate between infectious viruses and nonviable viruses, (ii) outlines the strengths and weaknesses of Nucleic Acid Sequence Based Amplification (NASBA) and microarray, (iii) discusses the role of digital PCR as an emerging water quality monitoring assay and its advantages over qPCR, (iv) addresses the viral metagenomics in terms of detecting emerging viral pathogens and diversity in aquatic environment. Indeed, there are many challenges for selecting methods to detect classic and emerging viruses in environmental samples. While the existing techniques have revealed the importance and diversity of viruses in the water environment, further developments are necessary to enable more rapid and accurate methodologies for viral water quality monitoring and regulation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanalytical methods 3aaquatic environment 3acell culture 3acell lines 3agastroenteritis 3ametagenomics 3amicroarray technology 3amonitoring 3anucleic acids 3anucleotide sequences 3apathogens 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3ascreening 3asigns and symptoms (animals and humans) 3avirology 3aviruses 3awater quality 3awaterborne diseases 0aA549 cells 0aAdV 0aAMV 0aAstV 0aBGM 0aBKPyV 0acDNA 0addPCR 0adPCR 0adNTPs 0aEMA 0aEV 0aFCV 0aFRET 0aGPP 0aHAV 0aHEV 0aHPyV 0aICC-PCR 0aJCPyV 0aMA104 cells 0aMNV 0aMPN 0aNASBA 0aNGS 0aPFU 0aPMA 0aqPCR 0aPV 0aRdRp 0aRT 0aRoV 0aTCID50 0aTTV 0aUV 0aWHO 0aWTA 0aWWTP 0aViruses 0aWater contamination 0aWater quality 0aMolecular detection 0aMetagenomics1 aBibby, Kyle1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3142-60900 tJournal of virological methods.g2019 Apr., v. 266 p.11-24dElsevier B.V.aElsevier B.V.wJournal:12356x0166-09347nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jviromet.2019.01.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03062naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245011100168300001600279520162100295592002801916650002001944650002201964650002801986650001602014650002602030650003002056650002702086650001202113650002202125650001902147650001102166650001702177650002402194650002102218650000702239650001402246650002602260650001602286650001402302700001802316700001902334700002002353773011402373856008402487852000902571655001202580IND60112755920221117162342.0141111e201110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011275592DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jbiosc.2011.06.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYeo, In-Cheol10aNarrow antagonistic activity of antimicrobial peptide from Bacillus subtilis SCK-2 against Bacillus cereus  ap. 338-344.  aBacillus subtilis SCK-2, producing an antimicrobial peptide of this study, was isolated from Kyeopjang, the Korean traditional fermented-soybean paste. This strain showed a narrow antagonistic activity as it inhibited Bacillus cereus causing food poisoning in human. The antimicrobial peptide, tentatively named AMP IC-1, was purified, characterized, and compared to BSAP-254, another peptide which was previously recovered from traditionally fermented-soybean paste. AMP IC-1 was found to be more thermally stable than BSAP-254, retained inhibitory activity similar to that of BSAP-254 over wide range of pH values, and was also destroyed by proteolytic enzymes. Two compounds were detected by anti-BSAP-254 polyclonal antibody and showed to contain peptide moieties and aliphatic hydrocarbons by Fourier transform infrared analysis. AMP IC-1 had an identical Rf value (0.69) on TLC plate and a molecular weight similar to that of BSAP-254 (AMP IC-1, m/z 3401; BSAP-254, m/z 3400 to 3473). AMP IC-1 was found to contain about 33 residues and 13 types of amino acids: Cys, Asp or Asn, Glu or Gln, Ser, Gly, Arg, Thr, Ala, Pro, Val, Ile, Leu, and Lys. Compared to BSAP-254, the molar ratios of Asp or Asn, Ser, Val, and Leu were different and only AMP IC-1 contained Arg, but not Trp. Both compounds showed non-hemolytic activity. A partial synergistic effect against B. cereus was observed in response to treatment when AMP IC-1 and BSAP-254 were administered in combination. Therefore, AMP IC-1 is a possible candidate as an antimicrobial agent to prevent food-borne infectious disease in human caused by B. cereus.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillus cereus 3aBacillus subtilis 3aadenosine monophosphate 3aamino acids 3aanti-infective agents 3aanti-infective properties 3aantimicrobial peptides 3aenzymes 3afoodborne illness 3ahuman diseases 3ahumans 3ahydrocarbons 3ainfectious diseases 3amolecular weight 3apH 3apoisoning 3apolyclonal antibodies 3aproteolysis 3asynergism1 aLee, Nam Keun1 aCha, Chang-Jun1 aHahm, Young Tae0 tJournal of bioscience and bioengineering.g2011 Oct., v. 112, no. 4 p.338-344dElsevier B.V.x1389-17237nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jbiosc.2011.06.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02554naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100006600139245013600205300001600341500002000357520116000377592002801537650001501565650001601580650001601596650001901612650002001631650001301651650001401664650001701678650001101695650001301706700007201719700005501791700001801846700007801864773013201942856007302074852000902147655001202156IND60688753620221120094439.0200416e202004  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068875362DNAL7 a10.1111/rda.136362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFerré‐Dolcet, Lluis1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4994-768X10aTyrosine phosphorylation is not a relevant mechanism to modulate aquaporin 2 activity in gestational queen endometrium and placenta  ap. 448-453.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aAquaporins have been shown to be regulated by phosphorylation of serine residues, but the possible role of tyrosine residues phosphorylation has not been evaluated. Changes in the localization of aquaporin 2 (AQP2) in the queen endometrium have been related to serum progesterone levels. The aim of this study was to determine whether these AQP2‐localization changes are mediated by variations in its tyrosine phosphorylation levels. Twelve queens were included in the study and divided into (a) non‐macroscopically pregnant with low levels of progesterone; (b) non‐macroscopically pregnant with high levels of progesterone; (c) 30 days of pregnancy; and (d) 60 days of pregnancy. Samples from endometrium and placental transference zone were obtained, immunoprecipitated and analysed by immunoblotting to determine the abundance of AQP2 and its relative levels of tyrosine phosphorylation. No significant differences in the tyrosine phosphorylation levels of immunoprecipated‐AQP2 were observed between groups. We can thus conclude that changes in the localization of AQP2 in the queen endometrium are not modulated by tyrosine phosphorylation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaquaporins 3ablood serum 3aendometrium 3aimmunoblotting 3aphosphorylation 3aplacenta 3apregnancy 3aprogesterone 3aserine 3atyrosine1 aRodríguez‐Gil, Joan Enric1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1112-98841 aYeste, Marc1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2209-340X1 aRigau, Teresa1 aRivera del Alamo, Maria Montserrat1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9557-48880 tReproduction in domestic animals.g2020 Apr., v. 55, no. 4 p.448-453dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl44391x0936-67687nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/rda.136363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02333naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001700146245011800163300001600281520102100297592002801318650002101346650001601367650003301383650001001416650001401426650001801440653001601458653002801474653001401502653001601516653003301532700001401565700001901579700001801598700001501616700001601631700001501647700001901662773012901681856008001810852000901890655001201899IND60622099120221121141931.0181123e201210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062209912DNAL7 a10.1177/10820132114330712doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTian, Yuting10aOptimization of microwave vacuum drying of lotus (Nelumbo nucifera Gaertn.) seeds by response surface methodology  ap. 477-488.  aDrying is the main process used to treat lotus seeds for storage. In this study, response surface methodology was used to optimize processing methods for microwave vacuum (MWV) drying of lotus seeds and to create a desirable product. A central composite design with three important factors: microwave output power (2.0–4.0 kW), vacuum degree (−0.070 to −0.090 MPa) and on/off ratio (68/52 s to 99/21 s) was used to study the response variables of drying time, shrinkage ratio, rehydration ratio and whiteness index. The optimum conditions for MWV drying of lotus seeds were determined to obtain a minimal drying time, minimal shrinkage ratio, maximum rehydration ratio and maximum whiteness index. The optimum drying conditions were found to be: microwave output power 3.2 kW, vacuum degree −0.083 MPa and on/off ratio 94/26 s. Under these optimal conditions, drying time, shrinkage ratio, rehydration ratio and whiteness index were found to be 10 min, 37.66%, 157.1% and 68.83, respectively.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNelumbo nucifera 3arehydration 3aresponse surface methodology 3aseeds 3ashrinkage 3avacuum drying 0aLotus seeds 0amicrowave vacuum drying 0ashrinkage 0arehydration 0aresponse surface methodology1 aZhang, Yi1 aZeng, Shaoxiao1 aZheng, Yafeng1 aChen, Feng1 aGuo, Zhebin1 aLin, Yufei1 aZheng, Baodong0 tFood science and technology international.g, v. 18, no. 5 p.477-488dSAGE PublicationswJournal:jnl3949853x1082-01327nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/10820132114330713Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03661naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100001800137245002400155300001600179520236200195592002802557650001902585650001702604650002502621650001302646650001302659650002102672650001202693650001902705650002502724650000902749650001502758650002502773650002602798650001202824650001202836650001802848650000902866650000902875650000902884650002002893650001702913650001902930650001302949650001602962650001002978700001202988773008403000856003803084852000903122655001203131IND50074865420221119083650.0140410s2014    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007486542DNAL7 a10.1071/SR133592doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMukherjee, A.14aThe biochar dilemma  ap. 217-230.  aAny strategy towards widespread adoption of biochar as a soil amendment is constrained by the scarcity of field-scale data on crop response, soil quality and environmental footprint. Impacts of biochar as a soil amendment over a short period based on laboratory and greenhouse studies are often inconclusive and contradictory. Yet biochar is widely advocated as a promising tool to improve soil quality, enhance C sequestration, and increase agronomic yield. While substantial reviews exist on positive aspects of biochar research, almost no review to date has compiled negative aspects of it. Although biochar science is advancing, available data indicate several areas of uncertainty. This article reviews a range of negative impacts of biochar on soil quality, crop yield, and associated financial risk. This review is important because advances in biochar research demand identification of the risks (if any) of using biochar as a soil amendment before any large-scale field application is recommended. It is the first attempt to acknowledge such issues with biochar application in soil. Thus, the aims of this review are to assess the uncertainties of using biochar as a soil amendment, and to clarify ambiguity regarding interpretation of research results. Along with several unfavourable changes in soil chemical, physical and biological properties, reduction in crop yield has been reported. Relative to controls, the yield for biochar-amended soil (application rate 0.2–20% w/w) has been reduced by 27, 11, 36, 74, and 2% for rice (Oryza sativa L.) (control 3.0Mgha-1), wheat (Triticum spp. L.) (control 4.6Mgha-1), maize (Zea mays L.) (control 4.7Mgha-1), lettuce (Lactuca sativa L.) (control 5.4Mgha-1), and tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L.) (control 265Mgha-1), respectively. Additionally, compared with unamended soils, gaseous emissions from biochar-amended soils (application rate 0.005–10% w/w) have been enhanced up to 61, 152 and 14% for CO2 (control 9.7Mgha-1 year-1), CH4 (control 222kg ha-1 year-1), and N2O (control 4.3kg ha-1 year-1), respectively. Although biochar has the potential to mitigate several environmental problems, the data collated herein indicate that a systematic road-map for manufacturing classification of biochars, and cost–benefit analysis, must be developed before implementation of field-scale application.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLactuca sativa 3aOryza sativa 3aSolanum lycopersicum 3aTriticum 3aZea mays 3aapplication rate 3abiochar 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbon sequestration 3acorn 3acrop yield 3aecological footprint 3aenvironmental quality 3alettuce 3amethane 3anitrous oxide 3arice 3arisk 3asoil 3asoil amendments 3asoil quality 3asoil treatment 3atomatoes 3auncertainty 3awheat1 aLal, R.0 tSoil research.g2014, v. 52, no. 3 p.217-230dCSIRO Publishingx1838-675X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1071/SR13359  aDNAL 7aarticle02231naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100005600139245004400195300001600239500001100255520103100266592002801297650001301325650001401338650001801352650001401370650002001384650001601404650001501420650001401435650001201449650002001461650001001481650001901491650001401510650001701524650001901541650001301560650001001573773013201583856007301715852000901788655001201797IND60688753720221120094506.0200416e202004  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068875372DNAL7 a10.1111/rda.136472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLlobat, Lola1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9806-917410aEmbryo gene expression in pig pregnancy  ap. 523-529.  aREVIEW  aPregnancy is a complex process in which significant changes occur continually in both the corpora lutea and in the endometrium of the females and varies depending on the embryonic, pre‐implantation or foetal stages. In the embryonic stages, the majority of genes expressed in the pig embryo correspond to the loss of cellular pluripotency. In contrast, the implantation consists of three phases: elongation of the conceptus, adhesion and union of the embryo to the endometrial epithelium. During these phases, many factors are expressed, including growth factors, molecules that facilitate adhesion and cytokines. All these changes are ultimately regulated by different lipid and hormonal substances, specifically by progesterone, oestradiol and prostaglandins, which regulate the expression of many proteins necessary for the development of the embryo, endometrial remodelling and embryo–maternal communication. This paper is a review of primary gene regulatory mechanisms in pigs during different stages of implantation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadhesion 3aconceptus 3acorpus luteum 3acytokines 3aembryo (animal) 3aendometrium 3aepithelium 3aestradiol 3afemales 3agene expression 3agenes 3agrowth factors 3apregnancy 3aprogesterone 3aprostaglandins 3aproteins 3aswine0 tReproduction in domestic animals.g2020 Apr., v. 55, no. 4 p.523-529dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl44391x0936-67687nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/rda.136473Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03970naa a2200781 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024004100113040001800154100001400172245017900186300001400365520161600379592002801995650001802023650001202041650002502053650001102078650001302089650001602102650001702118650001802135650001802153650001902171650003502190650002202225650001402247650002202261650001002283650001302293650002202306650001702328650002202345650002302367650001202390650002802402650004902430650004002479650001102519650003202530650002702562650000902589650002302598650002502621650003102646650003802677650001402715650002402729650002202753650001702775653001702792653001802809653001702827653001902844653001402863700001702877700001502894700001902909700001502928700001502943700001802958773010402976856008703080852000903167655001203176IND50066835320221117225052.0160902e20130801xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006683532DNAL7 a236399112pmid7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2013.03.0852doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aToumi, H.10aEffects of deltamethrin (pyrethroid insecticide) on growth, reproduction, embryonic development and sex differentiation in two strains of Daphnia magna (Crustacea, Cladocera)  ap. 47-53.  aAcute and different chronic ecotoxic effects of deltamethrin have been investigated on two strains (coming from two different laboratories) of Daphnia magna. The effective concentrations immobilizing 50% of daphnids (EC50s) after 24h and 48h were 9.40 and 0.32μgL−1, 8.86 and 0.63μgL−1 for first strain (strain 1) and second strain (strain 2), respectively. Thus, there was an increase of deltamethrin ecotoxicity with time of exposure as confirmed by chronic studies. After 21days of exposure to deltamethrin, daphnids have showed significant effects on survival at deltamethrin concentrations of 0.16μgL−1 and 0.31μgL−1 for strains 1 and 2, respectively. Eleven other endpoints were examined: body length, population growth rate and various reproductive parameters (days to first brood, number of broods, number of cumulative molts and number of neonates), embryotoxicity and appearance of males. IC10 values related to the number of juveniles per live adult were 11 and 46ngL−1 for strains 1 and 2, respectively. Furthermore, an increase in embryo deformities was observed at the highest concentrations tested for both strains. Following deltamethrin exposure, undeveloped second antennae, curved or unextended shell spines, and curved post abdomen spines were observed in live neonates. The production of male juveniles was only registered with strain 1 at 0.16μgL−1. Results suggest that deltamethrin could act as an endocrine disruptor in D. magna as it interferes with sex determination and development abnormality but there is a difference in sensitivity between the two tested strains.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDaphnia magna 3aabdomen 3aabnormal development 3aadults 3aantennae 3abody length 3adeltamethrin 3aecotoxicology 3aembryogenesis 3aembryotoxicity 3aendocrine-disrupting chemicals 3aexposure duration 3ajuveniles 3along term effects 3amales 3aneonates 3apopulation growth 3areproduction 3asex determination 3asexual development 2aAnimals 2aBody Sizexdrug effects 2aDaphniaxdrug effectsxgrowth & development. 2aEmbryonic Developmentxdrug effects 2aFemale 2aInhibitory Concentration 50 2aInsecticidesxtoxicity 2aMale 2aNitrilesxtoxicity 2aPyrethrinsxtoxicity 2aReproductionxdrug effects 2aSex Differentiationxdrug effects 2aSex Ratio 2aSpecies Specificity 2aSurvival Analysis 2aTime Factors 0aDeltamethrin 0aDaphnia magna 0aReproduction 0aEmbryotoxicity 0aSex ratio1 aBoumaiza, M.1 aMillet, M.1 aRadetski, C.M.1 aFelten, V.1 aFouque, C.1 aFérard, J.F.0 tScience of the total environment.g2013 Aug. 01, v. 458-460 p.47-53dElsevier B.V.x0048-96977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2013.03.0853Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02678naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100006000150245004700210300001800257506010400275506007600379520138500455592002801840506003701868650001501905650001101920650002401931650001301955650000901968650001501977650001801992653002602010653001402036653002402050653002502074773009902099856008502198852000902283655001202292IND60780596120221207050213.0220809e202208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078059612DNAL7 a10.1016/j.renene.2022.06.0192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPollini, Nicolò1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8504-600510aTopology optimization of wind farm layouts  ap. 1015-1027.  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aA novel approach for the solution of the wind farm layout optimization problem is presented. The annual energy production is maximized with constraints on the minimum and maximum number of wind turbines placed, and on the minimum spacing between the wind turbines. The proposed approach relies on a density-based topology optimization method, where continuous density variables varying between zero and one are assigned to each potential wind turbine location. A wind turbine exists if its associated variable equals one, otherwise it does not exist if the associated variable is zero. Intermediate values of the density variables are penalized with interpolation schemes traditionally used in the context of multi-material structural topology optimization. The penalized intermediate values of the design variables become uneconomical and the optimization algorithm is implicitly pushed towards a preference of crisp 0–1 final values. The optimization problem is solved with a gradient-based algorithm based on first-order information. Because of the proposed problem formulation, the functions involved are formulated explicitly in terms of the design variables and their analytical gradients can be calculated directly. The numerical results highlight the capability of the proposed approach in finding optimized wind farm layouts with small computational resources and time.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aalgorithms 3aenergy 3asystem optimization 3atopology 3awind 3awind farms 3awind turbines 0aTopology optimization 0aWind farm 0aLayout optimization 0aInterpolation scheme0 tRenewable energy.g2022 Aug., v. 195 p.1015-1027dElsevier LtdwJournal:11970x0960-14817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.renene.2022.06.0193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03518naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100005700139245010700196300001600303500002000319520157600339592002801915596010601943596011902049596006802168596008602236650001402322650003102336650001002367650001002377650004202387650001202429650001602441650001802457650001902475650001402494650004302508650005202551650002102603700001402624700001502638700001502653700001502668700001802683700001402701700001802715700001402733700001502747773013202762856007302894852000902967655001202976IND60688753820221120094401.0200416e202004  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068875382DNAL7 a10.1111/rda.136422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLian, Zhiquan1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0168-498810aRole of mRNAs and long non‐coding RNAs in regulating the litter size trait in Chuanzhong black goats  ap. 486-495.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aFecundity improvement is one of the most important objectives for goat breeders as it can considerably greatly increase production efficiency. The molecular mechanisms underlying fecundity in goats remain largely unknown. To explore the molecular and genetic mechanisms related to the fecundities and prolificacies in Chuanzhong black goats, we performed high‐throughput RNA sequencing to identify differentially expressed long non‐coding RNAs (lncRNAs) and mRNAs (DElncRNAs and DEmRNAs, respectively) the ovaries of high‐fecundity and low‐fecundity goats; furthermore, we conducted functional annotation analyses to identify pathways of interest. Overall, 1,353 DEmRNAs and 168 DElncRNAs were identified. Quantitative real‐time PCR (qRT‐PCR) was performed to validate some randomly selected DElncRNAs and DEmRNAs. We found that two DElncRNAs ENSCHIT00000005909 and ENSCHIT00000005910 might positively influence the expression of the corresponding gene IL1R2 (upregulated in high‐fecundity group), exerting co‐regulative effects on the ovarian function, through which litter size might show variations. KEGG pathway analysis indicated that the DEmRNAs SRD5A2, LOC102191297 and LOC102171967 were significantly enriched in steroid hormone biosynthesis—this pathway was related to animal reproduction. To summarize, our findings expand the understanding pertaining to the biological functions of lncRNAs and contribute to the annotation of the goat genome; moreover, they should be helpful for further studying the role of lncRNAs in ovulation and lambing.  aPublisher supplied data  a2017KQNCX014cThe Youth Innovative Personnel Project of Department of Education of Guangdong Province  cThe Guangdong Provincial Promotion Project on Preservation and Utilization of Local Breed of Livestock and Poultry  aZR2017BC101cThe Shandong Provincial Natural Science Foundation  a2019KJ127cModern Agricultural Industrial Technology System of Guangdong Province 3afecundity 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3agoats 3ahigh-throughput nucleotide sequencing 3alambing 3alitter size 3amessenger RNA 3anon-coding RNA 3aovulation 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3asteroid hormones1 aZou, Xian1 aHan, Yinru1 aDeng, Ming1 aSun, Baoli1 aGuo, Yongqing1 aZhou, Lei1 aLiu, Guangbin1 aLiu, Dewu1 aLi, Yaokun0 tReproduction in domestic animals.g2020 Apr., v. 55, no. 4 p.486-495dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl44391x0936-67687nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/rda.136423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02220naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245008500157520124500242592002801487650001101515650001601526650001201542650001901554650001501573650002901588650001601617651001501633700001501648700001801663773012901681856007501810852000901885655001201894IND60757954420221119141105.0211125e20211114xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075795442DNAL7 a10.3390/rs132245752doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Yuankun 10aP-Band InSAR for Geohazard Detection over Forested Terrains: Preliminary Results  aDecorrelation of X, C, and L-band InSAR (Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar) over densely vegetated regions is a common obstacle for detecting ground deformation beneath forest canopies. Using long-wavelength P-band SAR sensors (wavelength of 69.72 cm), which can penetrate through dense forests and collect relatively consistent signals from ground surface, is one potential solution. Here, we experimented using the NASA JPL (Jet Propulsion Laboratory)’s P-band AirMOSS (Airborne Microwave Observatory of Subcanopy and Subsurface) radar system to collect repeat-pass P-band SAR data over densely vegetated regions in Oregon and California (USA), and generated by far the first P-band InSAR results to test the capability of P-band InSAR for geohazard detection over forested terrains. Our results show that the AirMOSS P-band InSAR could retain coherence two times as high as the L-band satellite ALOS-2 (Advanced Land Observing Satellite-2) data, and was significantly more effective in discovering localized geohazards that were unseen by the ALOS-2 interferograms over densely vegetated areas. Our results suggest that the airborne P-band InSAR could be a revolutionary tool for studying geohazards under dense forest canopies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOregon 3adeformation 3aforests 3ainterferometry 3asatellites 3asynthetic aperture radar 3awavelengths 3aCalifornia1 aLu, Zhong 1 aKim, Jin Woo,0 tRemote Sensing.g2021 Nov. 14, v. 13, no. 22dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:26717x2072-42927nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs132245753Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01567naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245010300169300001600272520043900288592002800727650002500755650001700780650001100797650001300808700001700821700001800838700001700856700001900873700001800892700001900910700001800929700002200947700001700969773011400986856008401100852000901184655001201193IND60112756220221122003900.0141111e201110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011275622DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jbiosc.2011.06.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPark, Jung-Min10aEffect of antioxidant activity in kimchi during a short-term and over-ripening fermentation period  ap. 356-359.  aThis study evaluated the antioxidant activities of kimchi at different fermentation times: short-term fermented kimchi (SK; less than 7days) and over-ripened kimchi (OK; greater than 2years).

However, these simple sequence repeats (SSRs) were seldom used directly to test interspecific transferability in the populations of closely related species. Aspidistra Ker‐Gawl. is a monocot genus with high species richness and diversity in flower structure, but its fresh floral materials are not easy to obtain. Until now, little is known about genetic background in the species of Aspidistra, quite apart from the fearful reduction of their natural habitats. In this study, the floral transcriptome of Aspidistra saxicola was obtained using NGS. Based on these data, a total of 5527 SSRs were identified in the unigenes. Among these SSRs, the proportions of di‐ and tri‐nucleotide repeats were quite close (49.6% verse 46.8%), and the most tri‐nucleotide repeats were AGG/CCT followed by AAG/CTT and AGC/GCT in A. saxicola, showing distinct differences with other angiosperm species. To assess genetic diversity in the species of Aspidistra, 48 SSR loci were tested in four available populations of A. elatior. The results revealed that more than a third of the loci were polymorphic. The majority of these primers could be amplified in 24 species representing the main clades of Aspidistra. The primer subsets from transcriptome data proved highly useful for detecting polymorphisms in the related species, supporting the finding that NGS is an efficient approach to molecular marker development at both intra‐ and interspecies levels, especially in endangered nonmodel species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAspidistra 3aflowers 3agenetic background 3agenetic variation 3ahabitats 3aloci 3amicrosatellite repeats 3aspecies diversity 3atranscriptome 3aunigenes 2aDNA Primersxgenetics 2aGenetic Markers 2aGenetic Variation 2aLiliaceaexclassificationxgenetics. 2aMicrosatellite Repeats 2aSpecies Specificity 2aTranscriptome1 aZhang, Yiqing1 aJin, Mingda1 aLi, Hankun1 aSong, Zhiping1 aWang, Yuguo1 aChen, Jiakuan0 tMolecular ecology notes.g2014 May, v. 14, no. 3 p.569-577x1755-098X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1755-0998.121973Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03065naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245012900159520196700288592002802255650001502283650001102298650002002309650001902329650001702348650001102365650001502376650001802391651001002409700001802419700001702437700001602454700002002470773012902490856007502619852000902694655001202703IND60757954520221119140959.0211125e20211114xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075795452DNAL7 a10.3390/rs132245762doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDuan, Yueming 12aA New Lightweight Convolutional Neural Network for Multi-Scale Land Surface Water Extraction from GaoFen-1D Satellite Images  aMapping land surface water automatically and accurately is closely related to human activity, biological reproduction, and the ecological environment. High spatial resolution remote sensing image (HSRRSI) data provide extensive details for land surface water and gives reliable data support for the accurate extraction of land surface water information. The convolutional neural network (CNN), widely applied in semantic segmentation, provides an automatic extraction method in land surface water information. This paper proposes a new lightweight CNN named Lightweight Multi-Scale Land Surface Water Extraction Network (LMSWENet) to extract the land surface water information based on GaoFen-1D satellite data of Wuhan, Hubei Province, China. To verify the superiority of LMSWENet, we compared the efficiency and water extraction accuracy with four mainstream CNNs (DeeplabV3+, FCN, PSPNet, and UNet) using quantitative comparison and visual comparison. Furthermore, we used LMSWENet to extract land surface water information of Wuhan on a large scale and produced the land surface water map of Wuhan for 2020 (LSWMWH-2020) with 2m spatial resolution. Random and equidistant validation points verified the mapping accuracy of LSWMWH-2020. The results are summarized as follows: (1) Compared with the other four CNNs, LMSWENet has a lightweight structure, significantly reducing the algorithm complexity and training time. (2) LMSWENet has a good performance in extracting various types of water bodies and suppressing noises because it introduces channel and spatial attention mechanisms and combines features from multiple scales. The result of land surface water extraction demonstrates that the performance of LMSWENet exceeds that of the other four CNNs. (3) LMSWENet can meet the requirement of high-precision mapping on a large scale. LSWMWH-2020 can clearly show the significant lakes, river networks, and small ponds in Wuhan with high mapping accuracy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3ahumans 3aneural networks 3aremote sensing 3areproduction 3arivers 3asatellites 3asurface water 3aChina1 aZhang, Wenyi 1 aHuang, Peng 1 aHe, Guojin 1 aGuo, Hongxiang 0 tRemote Sensing.g2021 Nov. 14, v. 13, no. 22dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:26717x2072-42927nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs132245763Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02480naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002000146245009700166300001600263520124000279592002801519650001201547650001301559650002701572650001001599650001201609650002501621650001401646650002301660650003201683650003201715650001501747653000901762653001101771653001601782653001101798653001101809700002001820773012901840856008001969852000902049655001202058IND60622099420221121223509.0181123e201212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062209942DNAL7 a10.1177/10820132114330742doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRazmait ė, V10aFatty acid composition in hybrid pigs as based on local fatty Lithuanian breed and wild boar  ap. 515-522.  aThe study was designed to investigate the fatty acid composition in longissimus dorsi (LD) and semimembranosus muscles (SM) and subcutaneous tissue of hybrid (1/4 Lithuanian indigenous wattle, 1/4 wild boar and 1/2 Yorkshire or 1/2 Landrace) pigs. The SM showed a tendency to have lower contents of monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) and higher contents of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) than the LD muscle. No statistically significant differences were observed between the muscles in lipid quality indices, i.e., atherogenic (AI) and thrombogenix (TI) indices and the ratio of hypocholesterolemic and hypercholesterolemic fatty acids (h/H). In the SM, the content of PUFA from Yorkshire-sired hybrids was relatively 47.8% higher, including C18:2n-6, C20:4n-6 and DPA (C22:5n-3) that were higher, respectively, by 44.3%, 86.6% and 51.6% in comparison with those from Landrace-sired hybrids. The gilts had a lower content of MUFA, including C18:1 and C20:1n-9 fatty acids in the LD muscle and tended to have a higher content of PUFA in the SM compared to the barrows. Neither the terminal breed in crossing, nor the gender had any significant effects on the proportions of total saturated, MUFA and PUFA in the subcutaneous tissue.  aPublisher supplied data 3abarrows 3acrossing 3afatty acid composition 3agilts 3ahybrids 3ahypercholesterolemia 3alandraces 3alongissimus muscle 3amonounsaturated fatty acids 3apolyunsaturated fatty acids 3awild boars 0aMeat 0alipids 0afatty acids 0ahybrid 0agender1 aŠvirmickas, GJ0 tFood science and technology international.g, v. 18, no. 6 p.515-522dSAGE PublicationswJournal:jnl3949853x1082-01327nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/10820132114330743Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03076naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100003200153245008200185300001600267520161000283592002801893650003401921650001701955650001501972650000901987650001601996650001202012650002002024650001502044650001302059650001902072650000802091650002102099650001202120653001202132653001002144653001502154653001302169653001902182653000802201653001202209700002302221700005702244700002002301700002102321700001902342773010002361856008802461852000902549655001202558IND60611148320221121024422.0181127e201811  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061114832DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apgeochem.2018.07.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aÇevirim-Papaioannou, Neşe10aRedox chemistry of uranium in reducing, dilute to concentrated NaCl solutions  ap. 286-300.  aThe redox behaviour of uranium was investigated in 0.1 and 5.0 M NaCl solutions at 2 ≤ pHm ≤ 14.5 (pHm = –log [H+]) in the presence of different reducing chemical systems (Sn(II), Na2S2O4, Sn(II) + TiO2, Sn(II) + Fe(0), Sn(II) + Fe3O4). All experiments were performed under Ar atmosphere at T = (22 ± 2) °C. Uranium was added to independent batch samples as U(VI) (with [U]0 = 3.0⋅10−5 or 4.2⋅10−4 M), and the evolution of uranium concentration monitored for t ≤ 635 days. After attaining equilibrium conditions, [U] was found in all cases clearly below the solubility of U(VI) solid phases (UO3⋅2H2O(cr) or Na2U2O7⋅H2O(cr)) and in good agreement with the solubility of tetravalent UO2(am, hyd) as calculated with available thermodynamic data. This observation is in line with (pe + pHm) measurements, which in all cases fell in the stability field of U(IV). Solvent extraction and XANES confirmed also that uranium is predominantly found as U(IV) in the aqueous and solid phases investigated. No evidence on the formation of anionic hydrolysis species of U(IV) was obtained up to pHm = 14.5. Based on our long-term redox study, we conclude that previous investigations reporting the formation of U(OH)5– and U(OH)62− are possibly flawed by insufficient equilibration time, which prevented the complete reduction of U(VI) to U(IV).

K.10aApplication of Peleg's equation to describe creep responses of potatoes under constant and variable storage conditions  ap. 193-197.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe application of Peleg's equation to characterize creep behavior of potatoes during storage was investigated. Potatoes were stored at 25, 15, 5C, and variable (fluctuating) temperature for 16 or 26 weeks. The Peleg equation adequately described the creep response of potatoes during storage at all storage conditions (R² = .97to .99). Peleg constant k₁ exhibited a significant (p < .05) decreasing trend with storage time (tₛ) for samples stored under the experimental conditions whereas the constant k₂ appeared to be unaffected much by tₛ except for samples stored at 25C. Under constant temperature storage, k₁ was found to be a linear function of tₛ (R² = .87 to .97). Also, the rate of change of k₁ appeared to be temperature dependent described by a linear relationship between the degradation rate constant for k₁ (α) and storage temperature (T). For the variable storage condition, a bulk mean temperature (Tbₘ) was calculated to account for a series combination of storage time and temperature which the potatoes were subjected to. It was possible to describe the changes in k₁ due to variable storage temperature in terms of Tbₘ and tₛ using stepwise multiple regression (R² = . 94). PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Precise description of the changes in the rheological properties of raw potatoes during storage could help predict the associated effect on the texture of cooked potatoes. Easy and simple methods of describing creep responses during storage or processing will be potentially helpful to better understand the phenomenon. The model parameters from such model could be used to relate rheological properties of raw and cooked potatoes. Moreover, the model parameters could be used to establish relationship between instrumental and sensory attributes which will help in the prediction of sensory attributes from instrumental data.  aPublisher supplied data 3aequations 3amodels 3apotatoes 3aprediction 3aregression analysis 3arheological properties 3asensory properties 3astorage temperature 3astorage time 3atexture1 aJindal, V.

Knowledge about the protein composition of the spleen microenvironment in a control situation and during systemic inflammation may contribute to our understanding of the pathophysiology of sepsis. To our knowledge, the proteome of the fluid phase of the spleen microenvironment has not previously been investigated. In order to access the proximal fluid surrounding the splenic cells, we collected postnodal efferent spleen lymph from rats by cannulation, and spleen interstitial fluid (IF) by centrifugation. The origin of the isolated spleen IF was assessed by the extracellular tracer ⁵¹Cr-EDTA and the plasma tracer ¹²⁵I-HSA. Spleen lymph, IF, and plasma samples were collected during lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induced systemic inflammation and analyzed using a cytokine multiplex assay and, for the first time, using label-free mass spectrometry based proteomics. The concentrations of TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, and IL-10 increased severalfold in all fluids after LPS exposure. In total, 281, 201, and 236 proteins were identified in lymph, IF, and plasma, respectively, and several of these were detected after LPS only. A disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motifs 1 (ADAMTS1) was detected by proteomics (the pro- region) in lymph only after LPS. ADAMTS1 was assessed by ELISA (the metalloproteinase domain), and the concentration was significantly higher in IF and lymph than in plasma in a control situation, showing local production in the spleen. A dramatic increase in ADAMTS1 was detected in lymph, IF, and plasma after LPS exposure. In conclusion, the procedures we used to isolate IF and lymph from the spleen during LPS enabled detection of locally produced proteins. Furthermore, we have demonstrated that the inflammatory proteome is different in the spleen microenvironment when compared to that in plasma.  aPublisher supplied data 3ablood 3acentrifugation 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3ainflammation 3ainterleukin-10 3ainterleukin-1beta 3ainterleukin-6 3alipopolysaccharides 3alymph 3amass spectrometry 3apathogens 3apathophysiology 3aproteins 3aproteome 3aproteomics 3arats 3asepsis (infection) 3aspleen 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha 0ainflammation 0asepsis 0aspleen 0alymph 0ainterstitial fluid 0aproteomics1 aKarlsen, Tine V.1 aHaslene-Hox, Hanne1 aSemaeva, Elvira1 aJanaczyk, Bartlomiej1 aTenstad, Olav1 aWiig, Helge0 tJournal of Proteome Research.g2012 Nov. 02, v. 11, no. 11 p.5338-5349dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23605x1535-39077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fpr30056663Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02731naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005500150245011300205300001600318520126500334592002801599650002101627650002401648650002101672650001501693650001501708650001201723650001801735650002901753650001901782650001401801650001601815650002301831653001701854653003601871653001901907653001301926653001301939653001201952700002301964700006401987700001902051773009702070856008502167852000902252655001202261IND60780596520221119013048.0220809e202208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078059652DNAL7 a10.1016/j.renene.2022.06.0422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIsmail, Amr1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3169-309210aCombined thermal hydrolysis pretreatment and anaerobic co-digestion of waste activated sludge and food waste  ap. 528-539.  aIn this study, the impact of thermal hydrolysis pretreatment (THP) on the mono- and co-digestion of thickened waste activated sludge (TWAS) and food waste (FW) was carried out at temperatures of 150, 170, 190, and 210 °C and volumetric ratios of 90:10, 70:30, and 50:50 in batch anaerobic tests. THP enhanced solubilization, reduced volatile suspended solids (VSS) and the particle size of TWAS as the temperature increased showing optimal improvements at 170 °C. THP showed no significant impact on FW with only marginal improvements at 150 °C. Increasing the temperature beyond 170 °C for TWAS and 150 °C for FW deteriorated anaerobic biodegradability forming refractory compounds. Co-digestion improved methane yields and kinetics as the contribution of FW increased. Co-digestion of thermally pretreated TWAS with FW improved the methane yields by 27% and kinetics by 29% at 170 °C with no synergism. Co-digestion of thermally pretreated FW with TWAS improved methane yields by 15% and kinetics by 25% at 150 °C, with improvements up to 21% in synergy. THP of the mixed feedstocks improved methane yields by 53% and kinetics by 92% at 170 °C, with improvements becoming less pronounced with the increase in the volume of FW and temperature.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactivated sludge 3aanaerobic digestion 3abiodegradability 3afeedstocks 3afood waste 3amethane 3aparticle size 3arenewable energy sources 3asolubilization 3asynergism 3atemperature 3athermal hydrolysis 0aCo-digestion 0aThermal hydrolysis pretreatment 0aMethane yields 0aGompertz 0aKinetics 0aSynergy1 aKakar, Farokh laqa1 aElbeshbishy, Elsayed1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9934-41821 aNakhla, George0 tRenewable energy.g2022 Aug., v. 195 p.528-539dElsevier LtdwJournal:11970x0960-14817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.renene.2022.06.0423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02868naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100006600150245011900216300001600335520137400351592002801725650001901753650002101772650002001793650001301813650002401826650001201850650001301862650001901875650001901894650003101913650001901944650001101963650003001974653003002004653001902034653002902053653002402082653002302106653002402129700006602153773009702219856008502316852000902401655001202410IND60780596620221119013224.0220809e202208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078059662DNAL7 a10.1016/j.renene.2022.06.0442doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBelessiotis, George V.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0502-295X10aPlasmonic silver (Ag)-based photocatalysts for H2 production and CO2 conversion: Review, analysis and perspectives  ap. 497-515.  aIn this review, the most recent developments regarding highly efficient photocatalytic composites containing plasmonic silver (Ag) are reported, with a detailed description of their Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) mechanisms, structural and electrochemical properties and their application in renewable fuel production through photocatalysis, specifically through water splitting towards hydrogen production and through carbon dioxide reduction towards the production of methane (CH₄), methanol (CH₃OH) and other chemicals. Firstly, an analysis of plasmonic composite properties shows their advantages for photocatalytic applications: enhancements induced by the localized SPR effect increase photo-charge production near the semiconductor surface with improved charge separation and light responsiveness in a wider spectral range. Next, a review of the effects of silver integration on the material properties of semiconductors, examined via physicochemical characterization techniques, is performed. Then, a critical view of recent photocatalysis applications of silver composites for the generation of hydrogen and carbon dioxide conversion products is presented, with a focus on the effect of silver integration on their mechanisms and performance. Finally, applications of the generated hydrogen and the CO₂ reduction-produced CH₄ and CH₃OH are explored.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon dioxide 3aelectrochemistry 3afuel production 3ahydrogen 3ahydrogen production 3amethane 3amethanol 3aphotocatalysis 3aphotocatalysts 3aphysicochemical properties 3asemiconductors 3asilver 3asurface plasmon resonance 0aSurface plasmon resonance 0aPhotocatalysis 0aCarbon dioxide reduction 0aHydrogen production 0aMethane production 0aMethanol production1 aKontos, Athanassios G.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9193-01980 tRenewable energy.g2022 Aug., v. 195 p.497-515dElsevier LtdwJournal:11970x0960-14817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.renene.2022.06.0443Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02850naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002500149245009400174300001600268520131300284592002801597650002101625650001901646650002101665650001501686650002101701650002001722650001001742650001801752650001101770650002001781650001501801650002001816650001101836653000801847653000801855653001401863653000801877653000801885653000901893653001001902653003801912653002101950653003501971653001402006653004202020700001902062773014602081856008402227852000902311655001202320IND60644316820221120102448.0200614e201805  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064431682DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ymben.2018.03.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKremkow, Benjamin G.10aGlyco-Mapper: A Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) genome-specific glycosylation prediction tool  ap. 134-142.  aGlyco-Mapper is a novel systems biology product quality prediction tool created using a new framework termed: Discretized Reaction Network Modeling using Fuzzy Parameters (DReaM-zyP). Within Glyco-Mapper, users fix the nutrient feed composition and the glycosylation reaction fluxes to fit the model glycoform to the reference experimental glycoform, enabling cell-line specific glycoform predictions as a result of cell engineering strategies. Glyco-Mapper accurately predicts glycoforms associated with genetic alterations that result in the appearance or disappearance of one or more glycans with an accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of 96%, 85%, and 97%, respectively, for publications between 1999 and 2014. The modeled glycoforms span a large range of glycoform engineering strategies, including the altered expression of glycosylation, nucleotide sugar transport, and metabolism genes, as well as an altered nutrient feeding strategy. A glycoprotein-producing CHO cell line reference glycoform was modeled and a novel Glyco-Mapper prediction was experimentally confirmed with an accuracy and specificity of 95% and 98%, respectively. Glyco-Mapper is a product quality prediction tool that provides a streamlined way to design host cell line genomes to achieve specific product quality attributes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChinese hamsters 3aanimal ovaries 3acell engineering 3acell lines 3afeed composition 3afeeding methods 3agenes 3aglycosylation 3amodels 3apolysaccharides 3aprediction 3aproduct quality 3asugars 0aCCM 0aCHO 0aDReaM-zyP 0aEPO 0amAb 0aSEAP 0asiRNA 0aChinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells 0aGenomic modeling 0aGlycosylation reaction network 0aGlycoform 0aBiopharmaceutical process development1 aLee, Kelvin H.0 tMetabolic engineering.g2018 May, v. 47 p.134-142dElsevier Inc.aInternational Metabolic Engineering SocietywJournal:12015x1096-71767nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ymben.2018.03.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03091naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245010400167300001400271520145200285592002801737650003501765650003001800650001101830650001201841650001201853650003001865650001301895650001501908650001401923650001901937650001801956650002801974650002402002650002902026650003102055653002702086653002402113653001402137653003502151653001302186700005702199700001802256700005602274700002502330700002202355773010102377856008602478852000902564655001202573IND60628341620221122103200.0190318e201903  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062834162DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aquatox.2019.01.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAndré, Ana14aThe retinoic acid receptor (RAR) in molluscs: Function, evolution and endocrine disruption insights  ap. 80-89.  aRetinoid acid receptor (RAR)-dependent signalling pathways are essential for the regulation and maintenance of essential biological functions and are recognized targets of disruptive anthropogenic compounds. Recent studies put forward the inability of mollusc RARs to bind and respond to the canonical vertebrate ligand, retinoic acid: a feature that seems to have been lost during evolution. Yet, these studies were carried out in a limited number of molluscs. Therefore, using an in vitro transactivation assay, the present work aimed to characterize phylogenetically relevant mollusc RARs, as monomers or as functional units with RXR, not only in the presence of vertebrate bone fine ligands but also known endocrine disruptors, described to modulate retinoid-dependent pathways. In general, none of the tested mollusc RARs were able to activate reporter gene transcription when exposed to retinoic acid isomers, suggesting that the ability to respond to retinoic acid was lost across molluscs. Similarly, the analysed mollusc RAR were unresponsive towards organochloride pesticides. In contrast, transcriptional repressions were observed with the RAR/RXR unit upon exposure to retinoids or RXR-specific ligands. Loss-of-function and gain-of-function mutations further corroborate the obtained results and suggest that the repressive behaviour, observed with mollusc and human RAR/RXR heterodimers, is possibly mediated by ligand biding to RXR.  aPublisher supplied data 3aendocrine-disrupting chemicals 3again-of-function mutation 3ahumans 3aisomers 3aligands 3aloss-of-function mutation 3amolluscs 3apesticides 3aphylogeny 3areporter genes 3aretinoic acid 3aretinoic acid receptors 3asignal transduction 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranscriptional activation 0aRetinoic acid receptor 0aRetinoid X receptor 0aRetinoids 0aEndocrine disrupting chemicals 0aMolluscs1 aRuivo, Raquel1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2412-87301 aFonseca, Elza1 aFroufe, Elsa1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0262-07911 aCastro, L.

This heterocyclic system possesses two reaction centers: the EWG-activated methylene group and the carbonyl moiety which were investigated in the course of present study. 2,3,3-Trimethyl-1λ6-isothiazolidine-1,1,4-trione and 4-methyl-5λ6-thia-4-azaspiro[2.4]heptane-5,5,7-trione were chosen as representatives of the given class of substances. The former is a classical spatially uncomplicated model substance, the latter bearing a spiranic cyclopropane substituent is interesting in terms of evaluation of strain cycle effects. Indeed, the data obtained convey information about the impact of the highly strained substituent on the reaction centers of the ketosultam core. Thus, in addition to less stability of the strained spiranic ketosultam, the reactivity of its carbonyl group is suppressed whereas the activity of the methylene group is enhanced being compared with the nonspiranic substrate. Apart from the difference in the chemical character of the given β-keto-γ-sultams we faced unprecedented products (1,1-dioxo-5-[2-(triphenylphosphonio)acetyl]-2,3-dihydro-1H-1λ6-isothiazol-4-olates) formed during the course of the reaction with the Wittig reagent triphenylcarbethoxymethylenephosphorane.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical reactions 3aheterocyclic compounds 3amodels 3amoieties 0aSulfonamides 0aSpiro compounds 0aElectrophiles 0aNucleophiles 0aX-ray study1 aDobrydnev, Alexey V.1 aDyakonenko, Viktoriya V.1 aKonovalova, Irina S.1 aShishkina, Svitlana V.1 aVolovenko, Yulian M.0 tTetrahedron.g2019 Mar. 01, v. 75, no. 9 p.1231-1245dElsevier LtdwJournal:11744x0040-40207nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tet.2019.01.0313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03832naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245008200157300001600239500002000255520258600275592002802861650002402889650002102913650002502934650001402959650001102973650001402984650001502998650001703013650001403030650001403044650002303058650001103081650001203092650001403104700001803118700002203136700001903158700001803177773010803195856007403303852000903377655001203386IND60571372120221123015516.0170712e201706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057137212DNAL7 a10.1111/jtxs.122452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAktar, Tugba10aHuman roughness perception and possible factors effecting roughness sensation  ap. 181-192.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aSurface texture sensation is significant for business success, in particular for solid surfaces for most of the materials; including foods. Mechanisms of roughness perception are still unknown, especially under different conditions such as lubricants with varying viscosities, different temperatures, or under different force loads during the observation of the surface. This work aims to determine the effect of those unknown factors, with applied sensory tests on 62 healthy participants. Roughness sensation of fingertip was tested under different lubricants including water and diluted syrup solutions at room temperature (25C) and body temperature (37C) by using simple pair‐wise comparison to observe the just noticeable difference threshold and perception levels. Additionally, in this research applied force load during roughness observation was tested with pair‐wise ranking method to illustrate its possible effect on human sensation. Obtained results showed that human's capability of roughness discrimination reduces with increased viscosity of the lubricant, where the influence of the temperature was not found to be significant. Moreover, the increase in the applied force load showed an increase in the sensitivity of roughness discrimination. Observed effects of the applied factors were also used for estimating the oral sensation of texture during eating. These findings are significant for our fundamental understanding to texture perception, and for the development of new food products with controlled textural features. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Texture discrimination ability, more specifically roughness discrimination capability, is a significant factor for preference and appreciation for a wide range of materials, including food, furniture, or fabric. To explore the mechanism of sensation capability through tactile senses, it is necessary to identify the relevant factors and define characteristics that dominate the process involved. The results that will be obtained under these principles will be helpful for the industry in the development and optimization of new products, especially for the individuals' with special needs. With this exploratory study, we illustrate differential thresholds of tactile senses under changing conditions of surface lubrication and applied force load. Also, the tests were carried out under different temperatures to understand the oral sensation capability. The results and correlations may provide useful information about texture sensitivity and also methodologies could be applied to general sensory studies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aambient temperature 3abody temperature 3abusiness enterprises 3afurniture 3ahumans 3aingestion 3alubricants 3anew products 3aroughness 3asensation 3asensory evaluation 3asyrups 3atexture 3aviscosity1 aChen, Jianshe1 aEttelaie, Rammile1 aHolmes, Melvin1 aHenson, Brian0 tJournal of texture studies.g2017 June, v. 48, no. 3 p.181-192dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx0022-49017nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jtxs.122453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03998naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001400139245018000153300001600333500002000349520193400369592002802303596008102331596004202412596007902454596007902533650001202612650001502624650001602639650001802655650002102673650002102694650002302715650002702738650002402765650001202789650001702801650001502818650002202833650000902855650002302864650001602887650002602903650001402929650001102943650001902954650001302973650002802986650001903014650001403033700001803047700001603065700001703081700005603098773014803154856007303302852000903375655001203384IND60682592220221118194404.0200130e202003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068259222DNAL7 a10.1002/jctb.62322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Jie12aA novel and effective pretreatment to stimulate short‐chain fatty acid production from waste activated sludge anaerobic fermentation by ferrous iron catalyzed peracetic acid  ap. 567-576.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aBACKGROUND: This study investigates a novel, efficient and green pretreatment approach using ferrous iron catalyzed peracetic acid oxidation (Fe²⁺/PAA) on anaerobic fermentation of waste activated sludge. The underlying mechanisms are also studied for both the chemical and microbial effects. RESULTS: The results indicate that Fe²⁺/PAA exhibit significant positive synergistic effect on short‐chain fatty acid (SCFA) generation, especially acetic acid. The maximal SCFA concentration of 272 mg COD g⁻¹ VSS is obtained with Fe²⁺ (2.7 mmol L–¹)/PAA (3.0 mmol L–¹), which is 5.2 times that of the control test. Fe²⁺/PAA can effectively facilitate sludge solubilization due to the disruption of extracellular polymeric substances structure and microbial cells. The biodegradability of released organic substance is also improved due to the oxidation of non‐biodegradable substances. The activity of functional enzymes for hydrolysis and acidification is enhanced but that for methanogenesis is inhibited. Further analysis on microbial community structure indicates that phylum Firmicutes and genera Proteiniclasticum showed the maximal positive correlation with SCFA production, while the abundance of methanogenic archaea especially acetoclastic methanogenic archaea is inhibited by Fe²⁺/PAA treatment. Moreover, the presence of Fe²⁺ lengthened the oxygen release period of PAA, the main functional reactive oxygen species are hydroxyl radicals and Fe²⁺ facilitated PAA generates more hydroxyl radicals thus enhancing the oxidation ability of PAA. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated that Fe²⁺/PAA can be used as an effective pretreatment method for SCFA accumulation in sludge anaerobic fermentation process. The findings obtained in this study will supply information for the application of Fe²⁺ catalyzed PAA pre‐oxidation in sludge treatment. © 2019 Society of Chemical Industry  aPublisher supplied data  a2017YFC0506003cKey R & D projects of the Ministry of science and technology  a18YF1407500cShanghai Sailing Program  a17295810603cShanghai Science and Technology Commission Innovation Project  a18295810400cShanghai Science and Technology Commission Innovation Project 3aArchaea 3aFirmicutes 3aacetic acid 3aacidification 3aactivated sludge 3abiodegradability 3acatalytic activity 3achemical oxygen demand 3acommunity structure 3aenzymes 3afermentation 3ahydrolysis 3ahydroxyl radicals 3airon 3amethane production 3amethanogens 3amicrobial communities 3aoxidation 3aoxygen 3aperacetic acid 3apolymers 3ashort chain fatty acids 3asolubilization 3asynergism1 aShang, Kankan1 aGuo, Xueyan1 aXia, Xingyan1 aDa, Liangjun1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6159-29330 tJournal of chemical technology and biotechnology.g2020 Mar., v. 95, no. 3 p.567-576dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl39259x0268-25757nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jctb.62323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03248naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001700139245014400156300001800300520135700318592002801675650003101703650001901734650001401753650001101767650002201778650002001800650002401820650002401844650001801868650001101886650001201897650002001909650002001929650002001949650002801969650001301997650001502010650003202025650001402057650001402071653002002085653002302105653003202128653003102160653002102191700001902212700002302231700001602254700001902270700002002289700001602309700002202325700002202347700002002369700001802389773011902407856007502526852000902601655001202610IND60567926020221118052424.0170501e20121102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056792602DNAL7 a10.1021/pr300582p2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHu, Chia-Wei10aPhosphoproteomic Analysis of Rhodopseudomonas palustris Reveals the Role of Pyruvate Phosphate Dikinase Phosphorylation in Lipid Production  ap. 5362-5375.  aRhodopseudomonas palustris (R. palustris) is a purple nonsulfur anoxygenic phototrophic bacterium with metabolic versatility and is able to grow under photoheterotrophic and chemoheterotrophic states. It has uses in carbon management, carbon recycling, hydrogen generation, and lipid production; therefore, it has the potential for bioenergy production and biodegradation. This study is the first to identify the phosphoproteome of R. palustris including 100 phosphopeptides from 54 phosphoproteins and 74 phosphopeptides from 42 phosphoproteins in chemoheterotrophic and photoheterotrophic growth conditions, respectively. In the identified phosphoproteome, phosphorylation at the threonine residue, Thr487, of pyruvate phosphate dikinase (PPDK, RPA1051) was found to participate in the regulation of carbon metabolism. Here, we show that PPDK enzyme activity is higher in photoheterotrophic growth, with Thr487 phosphorylation as a possible mediator. Under the same photoheterotrophic conditions, R. palustris with overexpressed wild-type PPDK showed an enhanced accumulation of total lipids than those with mutant PPDK (T487V) form. This study reveals the role of the PPDK in the production of biodiesel material, lipid content, with threonyl-phosphorylation as one of the possible regulatory events during photoheterotrophic growth in R. palustris.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRhodopseudomonas palustris 3abiodegradation 3abiodiesel 3acarbon 3acarbon metabolism 3aenzyme activity 3agene overexpression 3ahydrogen production 3alipid content 3alipids 3amutants 3aphosphopeptides 3aphosphoproteins 3aphosphorylation 3aphotosynthetic bacteria 3aproteome 3aproteomics 3apyruvate phosphate dikinase 3arecycling 3athreonine 0aphosphoproteome 0aphotoheterotrophic 0apyruvate phosphate dikinase 0aRhodopseudomonas palustris 0alipid production1 aLin, Miao-Hsia1 aHuang, Hsuan-Cheng1 aKu, Wei-Chi1 aYi, Tsun-Hsuan1 aTsai, Chia-Feng1 aChen, Yu-Ju1 aSugiyama, Naoyuki1 aIshihama, Yasushi1 aJuan, Hsueh-Fen1 aWu, Shixiong,0 tJournal of Proteome Research.g2012 Nov. 02, v. 11, no. 11 p.5362-5375dAmerican Chemical Societyx1535-39077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fpr300582p3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02691naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245016800166300001600334520141700350592002801767650001801795650001801813650001601831650003501847650001001882650000901892650001701901650001101918650001801929650001101947650002301958650000701981650001801988650002602006700002102032700002102053773011402074856008402188852000902272655001202281IND60112756920221122045220.0141111e201111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011275692DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jbiosc.2011.07.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTamai, Miho10aMitochondrial development of the in vitro hepatic organogenesis model with simultaneous cardiac mesoderm differentiation from murine induced pluripotent stem cells  ap. 495-500.  aInduced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells, resembling embryonic stem (ES) cells in many phenomena, including differentiation potential, colony morphology, and the expression of specific representative markers, were generated from differentiated somatic cells by exogenous expression of several transcriptional factors.

By measuring oxygen concentration and pH in the culture medium, respectively corresponding to the oxygen consumption rate (OCR) and extracellular acidification rate (ECAR), we compared the metabolic patterns and bio-energetic profiles of both iPS and ES cells during the hepatic differentiation. The bio-energetic profiles of the in vitro hepatic organogenesis from iPS cells accorded with each differentiation steps, from proliferation stage as the initiation, spontaneously beating cardiac differentiation in the next, and finally liver tissue-formation, as well as that from ES cells. Both iPS and ES cells were differentiated into liver-like tissue with similar mitochondrial development.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacidification 3aculture media 3ahepatocytes 3ainduced pluripotent stem cells 3aliver 3amice 3amitochondria 3amodels 3aorganogenesis 3aoxygen 3aoxygen consumption 3apH 3asomatic cells 3atranscription factors1 aYamashita, Arisa1 aTagawa, Yoh-ichi0 tJournal of bioscience and bioengineering.g2011 Nov., v. 112, no. 5 p.495-500dElsevier B.V.x1389-17237nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jbiosc.2011.07.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02651naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002100143245012000164520147300284592002801757650000801785650001401793650001001807650002001817650001401837650001101851650002501862650001101887651001301898700001601911700002401927700001501951700002501966700001901991700001502010700002102025773012002046856007802166852000902244655001202253IND60794195520221117100032.0220922e20220910xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079419552DNAL7 a10.3390/genes130916302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTehreem, Raeesa 10aExome Sequencing Identified Molecular Determinants of Retinal Dystrophies in Nine Consanguineous Pakistani Families  aInherited retinal dystrophies (IRDs) are a heterogeneous group of degenerative disorders of the retina. Retinitis Pigmentosa (RP) is a common type of IRD that causes night blindness and loss of peripheral vision and may progress to blindness. Mutations in more than 300 genes have been associated with syndromic and non-syndromic IRDs. Recessive forms are more frequent in populations where endogamy is a social preference, such as Pakistan. The aim of this study was to identify molecular determinants of IRDs with the common presentation of night blindness in consanguineous Pakistani families. This study included nine consanguineous IRD-affected families that presented autosomal recessive inheritance of the night blindness phenotype. DNA was extracted from blood samples. Targeted exome sequencing of 344 known genes for retinal dystrophies was performed. Screening of nine affected families revealed two novel (c.5571_5576delinsCTAGATand c.471dup in EYS and SPATA7 genes, respectively) and six reported pathogenic mutations (c.304C>A, c.187C>T, c.1560C>A, c.547C>T, c.109del and c.9911_11550del in PDE6A, USH2A, USH2A, NMNAT1, PAX6 and ALMS1 genes, respectively) segregating with disease phenotype in each respective family. Molecular determinants of hereditary retinal dystrophies were identified in all screened families. Identification of novel variants aid future diagnosis of retinal dystrophies and help to provide genetic counseling to affected families.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3ablindness 3ablood 3anight blindness 3aphenotype 3aretina 3aretinitis pigmentosa 3avision 3aPakistan1 aChen, Iris 1 aShah, Mudassar Raza1 aLi, Yumei 1 aKhan, Muzammil Ahmad1 aAfshan, Kiran 1 aChen, Rui 1 aFirasat, Sabika 0 tGenes.g2022 Sept. 10, v. 13, no. 9dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27140x2073-44257nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/genes130916303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03402naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245012900157300001600286500002000302520183000322592002802152650002102180650003202201650001202233650002502245650001702270650001402287650001102301650001302312650001702325650001902342650000902361650001702370650001402387650001502401650001302416650001002429650000902439650001802448650002302466650001902489650002402508650001402532650001702546650001602563650001302579650001202592700001802604700002302622773010802645856007402753852000902827655001202836IND60571372320221123001933.0170712e201706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057137232DNAL7 a10.1111/jtxs.122372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBinsi, P.

The changes in parameters associated with textural and lipid degradation was also evaluated to ascertain the interactive effect of polyphenols with muscle proteins. Further, the results were compared against vacuum and conventional polyethylene packaging practices. Prior to coating, the properties of antioxidants were evaluated in vitro based on total phenolic and flavonoid contents, 2, 2‐diphenyl‐1‐ picrylhydrazyl radical scavenging activity, inhibition of linoleic acid peroxidation, iron reducing power, and metal chelating ability. Coating with clove bud EO was found to be more effective in protecting the textural quality and retarding lipid oxidation of the fillets during chilled storage. Curry leaf EO was found to have only moderate effect. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: In addition to the well‐studied antibacterial and antioxidant properties, plant polyphenols have become an intense focus of research for their ability to cross‐link proteins that widens their applications for textural and functional modification of food and beverages. Currently, a number of carcinogenic chemicals such as ammonia and formalin are hazardously used to prevent texture deterioration in chilled fish associated with post‐rigor changes and microbial reactions. This study evaluates the efficacy of polyphenols present in culinary herbs such as clove bud and curry leaf EO, in stabilising the texture of fish meat during chilled storage. From the results, it could be inferred that both the EO at 0.25% level mediated protein cross‐linking/complexation and maintained textural integrity during chilled storage apart from exhibiting antioxidant activities.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBergera koenigii 3aPangasianodon hypophthalmus 3aammonia 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3abeverages 3acloves 3acoatings 3acold storage 3aessential oils 3afish 3afish fillets 3afish meat 3aflavonoids 3aformalin 3aherbs 3airon 3alinoleic acid 3alipid peroxidation 3amuscle protein 3aoxidative stability 3apackaging 3apolyethylene 3apolyphenols 3aproteins 3atexture1 aNinan, George1 aRavishankar, C.

With the increase of GO mass fraction or the decrease of GO sheet size, the optical absorption capacity of nanofluids can be enhanced, and a thin layer of nanofluid can absorb most of the solar irradiation. As for a direct absorption solar collector (DASC), the temperature rise increased with the irradiation angle at the reverse-irradiation mode because of the natural convection induced temperature uniformity improvement. There existed optimal GO concentrations with respect to the maximum temperature rises of GO nanofluids, and the optimal value is GO sheet size dependent. For GO sheet sizes of 50–200 nm, 200–500 nm and >500 nm, the optimal mass fractions are 150, 180 and 220 ppm, respectively, and the corresponding temperature rises were increased by 9.2 °C (28.2%), 7.9 °C (24.1%), and 6.9 °C (21.0%) as compared with that of water at the reverse irradiation angle of 45°. A 3D numerical simulation was performed to understand the irradiation angle induced natural convection contribution to the photo-thermal conversion performance, and an agreement was achieved with the experiment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3aconvection 3agraphene oxide 3airradiation 3amathematical models 3ananofluids 3asolar collectors 3asolar radiation 3asolar thermal energy 3atemperature 0aNanofluid 0aDirect absorption solar collector 0aGraphene oxide 0aPhoto-thermal conversion performance 0aOptical absorption property1 aLoh, Jean,1 aSun, Qin1 aHan, Xinyue1 aZhou, Guoqing0 tRenewable energy.g2022 Aug., v. 195 p.516-527dElsevier LtdwJournal:11970x0960-14817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.renene.2022.06.0493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02524naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001800139245007100157300001600228500002000244520130800264592002801572596001901600596008601619596002301705650002801728650002301756650002201779650001201801650002601813650001501839650001201854650002301866700006501889773011401954856007302068852000902141655001202150IND60688754820221120084442.0200416e202005  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068875482DNAL7 a10.1111/aec.128632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTaylor, Chris10aTemporal fragmentation of a critically endangered forest ecosystem  ap. 340-354.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aLandscape change and habitat fragmentation is increasingly affecting forests worldwide. Assessments of patterns of spatial cover in forests over time can be critical as they reveal important information about landscape condition. In this study, we assessed landscape patterns across the Mountain Ash (Eucalyptus regnans) and Alpine Ash (Eucalyptus delegatensis) forests in the Central Highlands of Victoria between 1999 and 2019. These forests have experienced major disturbance over the past 20 years through a major fire (in 2009) and extensive industrial logging. We found that around 70% and 65% of the Mountain Ash and Alpine Ash forest areas, respectively, were either disturbed or within 200 m of a disturbed area. Inclusion of planned logging increased these disturbance categories to 72% and 70%, respectively. We also found that the isolation of Mountain Ash core areas (patches of undisturbed forest >1000 ha) increased significantly (P < 0.05) over our study period, with the proximity between disturbed areas conversely increasing significantly (P < 0.05). This means that continued and planned disturbance through industrial logging will have an amplified adverse effect on remaining undisturbed ash forest patches, which will become smaller and more dispersed across the landscape.  aPublisher supplied data  cParks Victoria  cDepartment of Environment, Land, Water and Planning, State Government of Victoria  cThe Caponero Grant 3aEucalyptus delegatensis 3aEucalyptus regnans 3aforest ecosystems 3aforests 3ahabitat fragmentation 3alandscapes 3alogging 3atemporal variation1 aLindenmayer, David B.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4766-40880 tAustral ecology.g2020 May, v. 45, no. 3 p.340-354dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl59958x1442-99857nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/aec.128633Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02048naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245010800164300001800272520095900290592002801249650001201277650001401289650002101303650002201324650001401346650001901360650001301379650002201392650001601414700001801430700002001448700002401468773010301492856008201595852000901677655001201686IND60628991520221118053158.0190213e20190301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062899152DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tet.2019.01.0352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Haiyan10aControlling the fluoridophilicity of sulfonium boranes via chelation, Coulombic and hydrophobic effects  ap. 1123-1129.  aWe describe the synthesis and properties of a series of sulfonium boranes featuring a dimesitylboryl unit and a dimethylsulfonium or methylphenyl sulfonium moiety connected by an ortho- or para-phenylene linker. Acid-base and fluoride anion tritration experiments carried out in aqueous media indicate that [o-(Mes2B)C6H4(SMePh)]+ is the most Lewis acidic derivative. Structural and computational analysis indicate that the favorable properties of this cationic borane derive from the proximity of the sulfonium and boryl units which enhances the Coulombic stabilization of the ensuing zwitterions o-(Mes2XB)C6H4(SMePh) with X = OH or F. Another important factor is the overall hydrophobicity of the sulfonium borane which, we propose, promotes anion desolvation, a factor also favoring B-X bond formation. Finally, the crystal structure of o-(Mes2FB)C6H4(SMePh) shows that the zwitterion is further stabilized by formation of a BF→S chelate motif.  aPublisher supplied data 3aboranes 3achelation 3achemical bonding 3acrystal structure 3afluorides 3ahydrophobicity 3amoieties 3aorganic compounds 3azwitterions1 aKim, Youngmin1 aPark, Gyeongjin1 aGabbai, Francois P.0 tTetrahedron.g2019 Mar. 01, v. 75, no. 9 p.1123-1129dElsevier LtdwJournal:11744x0040-40207nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tet.2019.01.0353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02216naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001400150245011100164300001800275520115600293592002801449650001101477650001401488650001701502650002301519650001801542650001401560700001601574700001701590700002001607700001701627700001601644773011101660856008601771852000901857655001201866IND60530427020221119112105.0160721e20160719xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053042702DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.analchem.6b017492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Lu10aNonspecific Organelle-Targeting Strategy with Core–Shell Nanoparticles of Varied Lipid Components/Ratios  ap. 7344-7351.  aWe report a nonspecific organelle-targeting strategy through one-step microfluidic fabrication and screening of a library of surface charge- and lipid components/ratios-varied lipid shell–polymer core nanoparticles. Different from the common strategy relying on the use of organelle-targeted moieties conjugated onto the surface of nanoparticles, here, we program the distribution of hybrid nanoparticles in lysosomes or mitochondria by tuning the lipid components/ratios in shell. Hybrid nanoparticles with 60% 1,2-dioleoyl-3-trimethylammonium-propane (DOTAP) and 20% 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (DOPE) can intracellularly target mitochondria in both in vitro and in vivo models. While replacing DOPE with the same amount of 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DPPC), the nanoparticles do not show mitochondrial targeting, indicating an incremental effect of cationic and fusogenic lipids on lysosomal escape which is further studied by molecular dynamics simulations. This work unveils the lipid-regulated subcellular distribution of hybrid nanoparticles in which target moieties and complex synthetic steps are avoided.  aPublisher supplied data 3alipids 3alysosomes 3amitochondria 3amolecular dynamics 3ananoparticles 3ascreening1 aSun, Jiashu1 aWang, Yilian1 aWang, Jiancheng1 aShih, H.

Vitamin C was added at 0 or 200 mg/kg, and Se was added as sodium selenite or selenized yeast at 0.3&nbsp;mg/kg. The feed intake and egg production were measured, and egg quality parameters were determined. Supplementation of the basal diet with Se significantly increased the laying performance; however, vitamin C significantly decreased feed intake and egg production. Vitamin C increased vitamin E concentration in the yolk. Both selenite and Se-enriched yeast increased the vitamin E concentration in the yolk and the Se concentration in the yolk and albumen. The oxidative stability of yolk lipids was improved in hens fed diets supplemented with sodium selenite, but not in those fed diets supplemented with Se-yeast. After 28 days of storage, however, the beneficial effect of selenite on lipid stability ceased. The supplementation of the basal diet with vitamin C significantly worsened the oxidative stability of yolk lipids, indicating that vitamin C acted as a pro-oxidant. Thus, vitamin C increased the laying performance and influenced some traits of egg quality. The combined supplementation of vitamin C and Se did not prove to be successful.  aPublisher supplied data 3aascorbic acid 3aegg production 3aegg quality 3afeed intake 3alipids 3aoxidative stability 3aselenium 3asodium selenite 3avitamin E 3ayeasts1 aMarounek, M.1 aEnglmaierová, M.1 aSkřivanová, V.0 tCzech Journal of Animal Science.g, v. 58, no. 2 p.91-97dCzech Academy of Agricultural ScienceswJournal:14567x1212-18197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.17221/6619-cjas3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04470naa a2200661 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001700153245006800170300001400238520272200252592002802974650002503002650001403027650001203041650001403053650001303067650002503080650002003105650001403125650001103139650001003150650001603160650001603176650001003192650001303202650001603215650001303231650001103244650001303255650001403268650001103282650001003293650001303303650001103316650001803327650001603345650001103361650001503372653002303387653001603410653002003426653003203446653002503478653002203503653001103525700001303536700001703549700001603566700001903582773009803601856008803699852000903787655001203796IND60611149120221120230558.0180911e201810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061114912DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apgeochem.2018.07.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Yanxin10aEnvironmental biogeochemistry of high arsenic geothermal fluids  ap. 81-92.  aArsenic (As) is a ubiquitous constituent in geothermal waters. Geothermal fluids with As concentrations ranging from 0.01 to tens of mg/L occur in different locations around the world, especially in geothermal systems along the boundaries of active plates. Leaching of reservoir rocks is the most important source of As in geothermal fluids. Arsenic exists in different As-bearing minerals in geothermal reservoirs with different temperatures, and the As concentrations in aqueous phase are affected by reservoir temperature to various degree. Arsenic concentration in geothermal waters depends on their genesis and geochemistry, with deep neutral chloride waters commonly containing much higher As concentrations than shallow acidic sulfate waters. During the upflow of geothermal fluids from the reservoir to the surface, As experiences a series of abiotic and biotic processes: oxidation, reduction, methylation and As-S redox cycling. Arsenic oxidation could happen under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions. Up till now a total of twelve aerobic As(III)-oxidizing bacteria have been isolated and thousands of clones harboring arsenite oxidase gene were detected in hot springs worldwide. As(III)-oxidizing rate of these isolates reached up to 1.27 μM/min. In situ microbial arsenate reduction in geothermal environment was found in the bottom water of Mono Lake fed by hot spring waters, and several arsenate reducers were reported in some geothermal waters as well. Inorganic As could be methylated in hot springs by biological activity. Arsenic and sulfur often coexist in geothermal environments and undergo similar chemical and microbial redox transformations. In sulfidic hot springs, thioarsenates/thioarsenites can be formed preferentially by replacing several hydroxyl groups in arsenate and arsenite with thiol groups, respectively, and thioarsenites/thioarsenates could be reciprocally transformed regardless of the presence of sulfur. Microorganisms in hot springs have been found to exert a profound influence on As and sulfur speciation by using them as both electron donors and acceptors, forming various thioarsenate species. Geothermal As from depth can be released into the surface or near-surface environments either via discharge of hot springs or geothermal wastewater, or via natural mixing of geothermal waters with local shallow groundwaters. Some rivers contaminated by geothermal As were estimated to discharge tens to more than one hundred tons of As per year. Understanding the biogeochemical behaviors of As in geothermal systems before and after mixing with shallow groundwaters and surface waters is therefore critical for the protection of water resources and the environment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanaerobic conditions 3aarsenates 3aarsenic 3aarsenites 3abacteria 3abioactive properties 3abiogeochemistry 3achlorides 3aclones 3agenes 3agroundwater 3ahot springs 3alakes 3aleaching 3amethylation 3aminerals 3amixing 3amoieties 3aoxidation 3arivers 3arocks 3asulfates 3asulfur 3asurface water 3atemperature 3athiols 3awastewater 0aGeothermal arsenic 0aHot springs 0aBiogeochemistry 0aOccurrence and distribution 0aEnvironmental impact 0aCurrent challenge 0aReview1 aLi, Ping1 aGuo, Qinghai1 aJiang, Zhou1 aLiu, Mingliang0 tApplied geochemistry.g2018 Oct., v. 97 p.81-92dElsevier LtdwJournal:11912x0883-29277nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apgeochem.2018.07.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02139naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094040001800138100004100156245010600197300001600303500002000319520094800339592002801287650002601315650002601341650002501367650001501392650001201407650001101419650001901430650002201449650001901471650001801490650002301508651001301531773012201544856009001666852000901756655001201765IND60682589320221118192723.0200130e199912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068258932DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1574-0862.1999.tb00599.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAmin Gutiérrez de Piñeres, Sheila,10aExternalities in the agricultural export sector and economic growth: a developing country perspective  ap. 257-267.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aFor years economists have ignored the diversity in agriculture and its potential to increase long run growth rates by enhancing a country's knowledge base. Non‐traditional agriculture requires significant investments in the infrastructure and knowledge; and therefore, has the potential to increase long run growth rates. Policy makers in developing countries have tended to enact macroeconomic policies designed to enhance the manufacturing sector at the expense of the agricultural sector. A theoretical model is developed to explain the dynamics between two non‐traditional export sectors and the long run economic growth of the country. The model illustrates that growth in highly perishable agricultural exports, not domestic production of manufactured goods, can potentially lead to higher long run growth rates. The model is applied to the fruit and flower industries in Colombia to bring forth an example with real world relevance.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural industry 3aagricultural products 3adeveloping countries 3aeconomists 3aexports 3afruits 3ainfrastructure 3aissues and policy 3amacroeconomics 3amanufacturing 3atheoretical models 3aColombia0 tAgricultural economics.g1999 Dec., v. 21, no. 3 p.257-267dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl41636x0169-51507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1574-0862.1999.tb00599.x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02280naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002800143245011100171520130100282592002801583650002501611650001801636650001901654700003001673700002901703700003001732700002101762773012001783856007801903852000901981655001201990IND60794192720221117100124.0220922e20220908xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079419272DNAL7 a10.3390/genes130916062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKyrgiafini, Maria-Anna 10aWhole-Genome Profile of Greek Patients with Teratozspermia: Identification of Candidate Variants and Genes  aMale infertility is a global health problem that affects a large number of couples worldwide. It can be categorized into specific subtypes, including teratozoospermia. The present study aimed to identify new variants associated with teratozoospermia in the Greek population and to explore the role of genes on which these were identified. For this reason, whole-genome sequencing (WGS) was performed on normozoospermic and teratozoospermic individuals, and after selecting only variants found in teratozoospermic men, these were further prioritized using a wide range of tools, functional and predictive algorithms, etc. An average of 600,000 variants were identified, and of them, 61 were characterized as high impact and 153 as moderate impact. Many of these are mapped in genes previously associated with male infertility, yet others are related for the first time to teratozoospermia. Furthermore, pathway enrichment analysis and Gene ontology (GO) analyses revealed the important role of the extracellular matrix in teratozoospermia. Therefore, the present study confirms the contribution of genes studied in the past to male infertility and sheds light on new molecular mechanisms by providing a list of variants and candidate genes associated with teratozoospermia in the Greek population.  aPublisher supplied data 3aextracellular matrix 3agene ontology 3amale sterility1 aGiannoulis, Themistoklis 1 aChatziparasidou, Alexia 1 aChristoforidis, Nikolaos 1 aMamuris, Zissis 0 tGenes.g2022 Sept. 08, v. 13, no. 9dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27140x2073-44257nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/genes130916063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03979naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002000142245013500162300001600297520273700313592002803050650001603078650001803094650001303112650002003125650002703145650001603172650001803188650001003206650001503216650001403231650001603245650001203261650001003273651001103283700001903294700001503313700001403328773012903342856007703471852000903548655001203557IND60765390020221121114208.0220904e20100528xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076539002DNAL7 a10.17221/66/2009-jfs2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVavříček, D.14aThe effect of point application of fertilizerson the soil environment of spread line windrows in the Kru&scaron;n&eacute; hory Mts  ap. 195-208.  aThe plateau of the Kru&scaron;n&eacute; hory Mts. belongs to areas that suffered the greatest damage caused by air-pollution stresses in Europe. A part of cultural practices aimed at the reconstruction of local mountain forests was the inconsiderate use of bulldozer technologies for the preparation of sites for forest stand restoration. In the course of large-scale scarification the top-soil horizons were moved into line windrows, which caused marked degradation of the soil environment. The present revitalization of the soil environment is based on the principle of spreading these man-made windrows. Experimental plots were established in localities affected by scarification; the organomineral material from windrows was superimposed on them and subsequently they were reforested with Norway spruce (Picea abies [L.] Karst.). In 2005 the point application of fertilizer tablets of Silvamix type in three treatments and calcic dolomite was performed into the rhizosphere of plants. Before fertilization and after three years of the experiment soil samples were taken from the organomineral zone of the root balls of plants, and the condition of the soil environment on spread windrows and changes in pedochemical properties as a result of applied fertilization were evaluated. Three years after the windrow spreading the content of the majority of soil macrobiogenic elements (N, K, Ca, Mg) is at the level of medium-high to high reserves, and only the low phosphorus reserves pose a certain hazard. The organomineral substrate of spread windrows is a suitable growth environment for the root systems of target tree species. The proportion of humus substances is the most important factor in spread windrows from which the characteristics of the other parameters of soil are derived. Along with the higher proportion of humus substances in &Scaron;pič&aacute;k locality significantly higher reserves of major macrobiogenic elements (N, P, K, Ca, Mg) were determined. The applied fertilizers of Silvamix type significantly increased the reserves of soil P, K, Ca, Mg and are a suitable means for the stimulation of spruce plantations in the restored environment of the Kru&scaron;n&eacute; hory Mts. Silvamix Forte fertilizer tablets are the most complex fertilizer with the most balanced effects that significantly increases the reserves of soil P, Mg and K. This fertilizer has a high effect on an increase in the reserves of soil phosphorus that may be deficient in conditions of spread windrows. Silvamix R is the most efficient fertilizer to increase potassium reserves. A positive effect of calcic dolomite on an increase in Ca and Mg content was observed while no such effect on the other elements was recorded. &nbsp;  aPublisher supplied data 3aPicea abies 3aair pollution 3adolomite 3aedaphic factors 3afertilizer application 3afertilizers 3aforest stands 3ahumus 3aphosphorus 3apotassium 3arhizosphere 3atopsoil 3atrees 3aEurope1 aPecháček, J.1 aJonák, P.1 aSamec, P.0 tJournal of Forest Science.g, v. 56, no. 5 p.195-208dCzech Academy of Agricultural ScienceswJournal:21419x1212-48347nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.17221/66/2009-jfs3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02650naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001500151245012300166520159400289592002801883650001701911650001401928650001101942650001701953651001001970653002501980653001702005653002402022653002602046700001202072700001902084773011402103856008602217852000902303655001202312IND60780593620221119012915.0221004e20220910xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078059362DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2022.1327302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZeng, Peng10aCoupling and coordination analysis in urban agglomerations of China: Urbanization and ecological security perspectives  aAlong with China's rapid urbanization development process, the severe ecological security problems which brought by the urbanization related activities has gradually caused academic and public discussion. To reach the high-quality development goals set by central government decisions in China, it is necessary to clarify the relationship between urbanization and ecological security, which can provide guidance to explore the path of coordination. On the basis of three major urban agglomerations in China, this paper constructs the comprehensive evaluation system of urbanization and ecological security through multi-source data. By using the Entropy-weight TOPSIS method, cities' urbanization and ecological security levels are calculated. Through the coupling coordination model, the coordination levels between urbanization and ecological security were also analyzed. At the end, Through Kernel estimation and the Markov chain method, the relative-absolute differentiation and the overall evolution trend of the coordination development were also estimated. The research results indicate the following: (1) The core cities' urbanization and ecological security level in the region are relatively high, while the peripheral cities are generally low; (2) The coordination development in the urban agglomerations revealed as a relatively steady progress; (3) The aggregation effect gradually emerged under the coordination development periods in the urban agglomerations; (4) The overall coupling coordination development in urban agglomerations has the possibility of club convergence.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMarkov chain 3aevolution 3amodels 3aurbanization 3aChina 0aUrban agglomerations 0aUrbanization 0aEcological security 0aCoordination analysis1 aWei, Xu1 aDuan, Zhicheng0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2022 Sept. 10, v. 365 p.132730-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2022.1327303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03186naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002000139245010400159300001800263520158000281592002801861650002701889650002101916650002301937650002601960650002401986650001302010650002502023650002902048650001502077650001602092650002202108650001402130650002602144650001402170700002102184700001702205700002202222700002002244700001902264700001802283700001702301700001702318700001802335700002002353700001702373700002002390773016402410856007302574852000902647655001202656IND50085938420221118010310.0150218e201405  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008593842DNAL7 a10.1111/jam.124452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aErmolaeva, S.A.10aNonthermal plasma affects viability and morphology of Mycoplasma hominis and Acholeplasma laidlawii  ap. 1129-1136.  aAIM: To study the effects exerted by argon microwave nonthermal plasma (NTP) on cell wall‐lacking Mollicutes bacteria. METHODS AND RESULTS: 10⁸ CFU ml⁻¹agar plated Mycoplasma hominis and Acholeplasma laidlawii were treated with the nonthermal microwave argon plasma for 30–300 s. The maximal 10‐ and 100‐fold drop was observed for A. laidlawii and Myc. hominis, respectively. Similarly treated Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus demonstrated the 10⁵and 10³drop, respectively. Removal of cholesterol affected resistance of A. laidlawii. 10 mmol l⁻¹antioxidant butylated hydroxytoluene decreased mortality by a factor of 25–200. UV radiation alone caused 25–85% mortality in comparison with the whole NTP. Exogenously added hydrogen peroxide H₂O₂did not cause mortality. NTP treatment of Myc. hominis triggered growth of microcolonies, which were several tenfold smaller than a typical colony. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the lack of cell wall, A. laidlawii and Myc. hominis were more resistant to argon microwave NTP than other tested bacteria. Mycoplasma hominis formed microcolonies upon NTP treatment. A role of UV and active species was demonstrated. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The first study of NTP effects on Mollicutes revealed importance of a membrane composition for bacterial resistance to NTP. New specific Myc. hominis morphological forms were observed. The study confirmed importance of the concerted action of reactive oxygen species (ROS) with UV and other plasma bioactive agents for NTP bactericidal action.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcholeplasma laidlawii 3aEscherichia coli 3aMycoplasma hominis 3aStaphylococcus aureus 3aargon (noble gases) 3abacteria 3abioactive properties 3abutylated hydroxytoluene 3acell walls 3acholesterol 3ahydrogen peroxide 3amortality 3aultraviolet radiation 3aviability1 aRakovskaya, I.V.1 aMiller, G.G.1 aSysolyatina, E.V.1 aMukhachev, A.Y.1 aVasiliev, M.M.1 aAdgamov, R.R.1 aLevina, G.A.1 aPetrov, O.F.1 aMorfill, G.E.1 aGrigoriev, A.I.1 aFortov, V.E.1 aGintsburg, A.L.0 tJournal of applied microbiology.g2014 May, v. 116, no. 5 p.1129-1136dPublished for the Society for Applied Bacteriology by Blackwell Sciencex1364-50727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jam.124453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02510naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002200151245011000173300001800283520127400301592002801575650001301603650001801616650001801634650001301652650001401665650001301679650001201692650001901704653001901723653001101742653001301753653001301766653001201779653001301791653002201804700002401826773015501850856008602005852000902091655001202100IND60539252820221117224525.0190215e20140417xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053925282DNAL7 a10.1016/j.febslet.2014.02.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBaker, Michael W.10aControl of neuronal morphology and connectivity: Emerging developmental roles for gap junctional proteins  ap. 1470-1479.  aRecent evidence indicates that gap junction (GJ) proteins can play a critical role in controlling neuronal connectivity as well as cell morphology in the developing nervous system. GJ proteins may function analogously to cell adhesion molecules, mediating cellular recognition and selective neurite adhesion. Moreover, during synaptogenesis electrical synapses often herald the later establishment of chemical synapses, and thus may help facilitate activity-dependent sculpting of synaptic terminals. Recent findings suggest that the morphology and connectivity of embryonic leech neurons are fundamentally organized by the type and perhaps location of the GJ proteins they express. For example, ectopic expression in embryonic leech neurons of certain innexins that define small GJ-linked networks of cells leads to the novel coupling of the expressing cell into that network. Moreover, gap junctions appear to mediate interactions among homologous neurons that modulate process outgrowth and stability. We propose that the selective formation of GJs between developing neurons and perhaps glial cells in the CNS helps orchestrate not only cellular synaptic connectivity but also can have a pronounced effect on the arborization and morphology of those cells involved.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadhesion 3acell adhesion 3agap junctions 3aneurites 3aneuroglia 3aproteins 3asynapse 3asynaptogenesis 0aSynaptogenesis 0aTiling 0aDendrite 0aAdhesion 0aInnexin 0aConnexin 0aHomolog avoidance1 aMacagno, Eduardo R.0 tFEBS letters.g2014 Apr. 17, v. 588, no. 8 p.1470-1479dElsevier B.V.aFederation of European Biochemical SocietieswJournal:jnl16404x0014-57937nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.febslet.2014.02.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03112naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001500146245005700161300001600218520148400234592002801718650002601746650001901772650002201791650002201813650001101835650001901846650001801865650001901883650002501902650000901927650002701936650002101963650001601984650002002000650001102020650001802031650001802049650002602067650001502093650002402108650002202132650001502154650001602169653002702185653001602212700001902228700001702247700002202264700001502286700001502301773012902316856008002445852000902525655001202534IND60622097420221120100037.0181123e201206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062209742DNAL7 a10.1177/10820132114277982doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMorales, P10aFatty acids profiles of some Spanish wild vegetables  ap. 281-290.  aPolyunsaturated fatty acids play an important role in human nutrition, being associated with several health benefits. The analyzed vegetables, in spite of its low fat content, lower than 2%, present a high proportion of polyunsaturated fatty acids of n-3, n-6 and n-9 series, such as α-linolenic, linoleic and oleic acids, respectively. Wild edible plants contain in general a good balance of n-6 and n-3 fatty acids. The present study tries to contribute to the preservation and valorization of traditional food resources, studying the fatty acids profile of 20 wild vegetables by gas-liquid chromatography with flame ionization detection. Results show that species in which leaves are predominant in their edible parts have in general the highest polyunsaturated fatty acid/saturated fatty acid ratios: Rumex pulcher (5.44), Cichorium intybus (5.14) and Papaver rhoeas (5.00). Due to the low n-6/n-3 ratios of the majority of the samples, they can be considered interesting sources of n-3 fatty acids, especially those with higher total fat amount, such as Bryonia dioica, Chondrilla juncea or Montia fontana, with the highest contents of α-linolenic acid (67.78, 56.27 and 47.65%, respectively). The wild asparaguses of Asparagus acutifolius and Tamus communis stand out for their linoleic acid content (42.29 and 42.45%, respectively). All these features reinforce the interest of including wild plants in diet, as an alternative to the variety of vegetables normally used.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAsparagus acutifolius 3aBryonia dioica 3aChondrilla juncea 3aCichorium intybus 3aMontia 3aPapaver rhoeas 3aRumex pulcher 3aTamus communis 3aalpha-linolenic acid 3adiet 3afatty acid composition 3aflame ionization 3afood plants 3ahuman nutrition 3aleaves 3alinoleic acid 3alipid content 3aliquid chromatography 3aoleic acid 3aomega-3 fatty acids 3atraditional foods 3avegetables 3awild plants 0awild edible vegetables 0afatty acids1 aFerreira, ICFR1 aCarvalho, AM1 aSánchez-Mata, MC1 aCámara, M1 aTardío, J0 tFood science and technology international.g, v. 18, no. 3 p.281-290dSAGE PublicationswJournal:jnl3949853x1082-01327nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/10820132114277983Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03717naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002100140245015200161300001600313500002000329520244100349592002802790650001302818650001302831650001302844650002302857650001602880650001402896650001102910650002702921650001302948650001202961650001802973700002002991700002103011700002503032700002603057700002103083773010803104856007403212852000903286655001203295IND60571369620221120171649.0170712e201612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057136962DNAL7 a10.1111/jtxs.121862doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYoung, Ashley K.10aExploring the Links Between Texture Perception and Bolus Properties Throughout Oral Processing. Part 2: Bolus Mechanical and Rheological Properties  ap. 474-483.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThis study explored links between texture perception, breakdown path, and bolus properties throughout oral processing. Five subjects chewed biscuits to three stages of bolus formation (early, mid, and point of swallow). Bolus properties were measured using back extrusion (BE) (yield stress) and a modified texture profile analysis, consecutive double compression (CDC) (peak force, “adhesiveness”, and “cohesiveness”). The validity of the testing methods was discussed and BE was found to be better suited than CDC for testing boluses of varying size. In addition, results indicated that a greater understanding of the properties being measured by the CDC parameters is required. The bolus properties were linked to texture perception and breakdown path results presented in Part 1 of this study. At a panel‐level, yield stress and peak force decreased and “adhesiveness” and “cohesiveness” increased throughout oral processing. Interindividual differences were found in bolus mass, yield stress, peak force, “adhesiveness”, “cohesiveness”, and description of bolus properties using texture terms. A panel‐level analysis agreed with the “Mouth Process” and “Optimum Swallow” models. However, not all individuals' results were consistent with the latter model. A universal swallowing threshold for this biscuit recipe in terms of the measured properties was not found. Results suggest consumers can potentially be grouped by sensory experience, breakdown path, or bolus properties. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: The relationships between masticatory behavior, perceived texture, bolus structure, and mechanical and rheological properties throughout oral processing are still not fully understood. This study applies modified texture profile analysis and back extrusion methods for the testing of boluses at different stages of oral processing and discusses their validity. This study indicates that analyzing texture‐bolus property relationships at a panel – rather than individual – level may not provide a full picture of consumer experience. Although there are differences between consumers, they can potentially be grouped by sensory experience, food breakdown path, or bolus properties (including bolus moisture content and rheology). These groupings could be used to design studies that are more applicable to a general population and may be useful in tailoring foods to specific target groups.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadhesion 3abiscuits 3acohesion 3aconsumer attitudes 3adeglutition 3aextrusion 3amodels 3arheological properties 3arheology 3atexture 3awater content1 aCheong, Jean Ne1 aFoster, Kylie D.1 aHedderley, Duncan I.1 aMorgenstern, Marco P.1 aJames, Bryony J.0 tJournal of texture studies.g2016 Dec., v. 47, no. 6 p.474-483dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx0022-49017nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jtxs.121863Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02839naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100005800146245011700204300001800321520143700339592002801776650001401804650001401818650002301832650001701855650002301872650003001895650002101925650001101946650001501957650001501972650001301987650001402000650002302014700002002037700001602057700002302073700002202096700006302118773013502181856008002316852000902396655001202405IND60606100220221120211832.0180724e20180212xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060610022DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.7b126432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAbroshan, Hadi1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1046-517010aUltrathin Cobalt Oxide Overlayer Promotes Catalytic Activity of Cobalt Nitride for the Oxygen Reduction Reaction  ap. 4783-4791.  aThe oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) plays a crucial role in various energy devices such as proton-exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) and metal–air batteries. Owing to the scarcity of the current state-of-the-art Pt-based catalysts, cost-effective Pt-free materials such as transition metal nitrides and their derivatives have gained overwhelming interest as alternatives. In particular, cobalt nitride (CoN) has demonstrated a reasonably high ORR activity. However, the nature of its active phase still remains elusive. Here, we employ density functional theory calculations to study the surface reactivity of rocksalt (RS) and zincblend (ZB) cobalt nitride. The performances of the catalysts terminated by the facets of (100), (110), and (111) are studied for the ORR. We demonstrate that the cobalt nitride surface is highly susceptible to oxidation under ORR conditions. The as-formed oxide overlayer on the facets of CoNRS(100) and CoNZB(110) presents a significant promotional effect in reducing the ORR overpotential, thereby increasing the activity in comparison with those of the pure CoNs. The results of this work rationalize a number of experimental reports in the literature and disclose the nature of the active phase of cobalt nitrides for the ORR. Moreover, they offer guidelines for understanding the activity of other transition metal nitrides and designing efficient catalysts for future generation of PEMFCs.  aPublisher supplied data 3abatteries 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3acobalt oxide 3acost effectiveness 3adensity functional theory 3aelectrochemistry 3aenergy 3afuel cells 3aguidelines 3anitrides 3aoxidation 3aphysical chemistry1 aBothra, Pallavi1 aBack, Seoin1 aKulkarni, Ambarish1 aNørskov, Jens K.1 aSiahrostami, Samira1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1192-46340 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2018 Feb. 12, v. 122, no. 9 p.4783-4791dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23573x1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.7b126433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02733naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245008400168300001600252520146200268592002801730650001601758650001701774650000901791650001801800650003901818650001701857650002501874650002001899650000901919650001701928650000901945650002301954650001101977700001801988700002302006700001702029700002102046700002402067773011502091856008402206852000902290655001202299IND60112754220221120160041.0141111e201109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011275422DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jbiosc.2011.05.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMaeda, Yukiko10aAnalyses of peptides in sake mash: Forming a profile of bitter-tasting peptides  ap. 238-246.  aSome oligopeptides and amino acids have a strong influence on the sensory qualities of sake, but the formation process of such compounds in sake mash has not been well elucidated. In this study, we investigated the formation process of bitter-tasting peptides derived from rice proteins in sake mash, because knowledge about their formation may contribute to the quality control of sake. We analyzed rice protein hydrolysates in sake mash, as well as in the enzymatic digest of steamed rice grains digested by either sake-koji or by crude enzyme extracted from sake-koji. SDS–PAGE showed that a smaller amount of polypeptides (>M.W. 10,000) accumulated in the supernatant of sake mash than in either enzymatic digest. The concentration of peptides in the supernatant of sake mash increased gradually from the early stages of fermentation. Five bitter-tasting peptides (No. 9, <QLFNPS; No. 13, <QLFNPSTNP; No. 17, <QLFNPSTNPWH; No. 18, <QLFNPSTNPWHSP; No. 20, <QLFGPNVNPWHNP), which were previously found in sake mash, were not found in significant amounts in sake-koji. On the other hand, these peptides accumulated at the early stages of both sake mash fermentation and the enzymatic digests, although the levels in sake mash were higher than those in the digests. The present study demonstrated that the 5 bitter-tasting peptides formed in high concentrations when steamed rice grains were digested under conditions of sake mash fermentation with yeast.  aPublisher supplied data 3aamino acids 3afermentation 3amash 3aoligopeptides 3apolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 3apolypeptides 3aprotein hydrolysates 3aquality control 3arice 3arice protein 3asake 3asensory properties 3ayeasts1 aOkuda, Masaki1 aHashizume, Katsumi1 aJoyo, Midori1 aMikami, Shigeaki1 aGoto-Yamamoto, Nami0 tJournal of bioscience and bioengineering.g2011 Sept., v. 112, no. 3 p.238-246dElsevier B.V.x1389-17237nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jbiosc.2011.05.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03202naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002800147245014400175300001400319520151400333592002801847650001501875650001501890650002501905650002301930650001801953650001601971650001401987650002002001650002202021650002202043650001902065650000902084650002702093650001702120650001302137650002502150650002302175651001802198651001802216653002002234653001402254653002402268653002702292653002002319653001802339700002402357700002802381700003202409773011602441856008202557852000902639655001202648IND60525897420221120040708.0190401e201606  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052589742DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bse.2016.02.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFava, Wellington Santos10aDevelopment and characterization of microsatellite markers for Echinopsis rhodotricha and cross-amplification in other species of Cactaceae  ap. 19-23.  aLocated in central South America, the Chaco is a large subtropical dry forest characterized by plants with xeromorphic features, including numerous cacti. In the Brazilian Chaco at the northeasternmost part of the Chaquenian region, Echinopsis rhodotricha (Cactaceae, Trichocereeae) is one of the species threatened by intense deforestation caused by expanding pastureland. This study characterizes the microsatellite loci isolated from E. rhodotricha and cross-amplification in thirteen other cactus species. Twelve microsatellite loci were developed from an enriched genomic library. Eight of these were polymorphic and characterized in 48 individuals from three E. rhodotricha populations. The loci showed a mean of 3.2 alleles per locus and overall levels of expected and observed heterozygosities ranging from 0.00 to 0.83 and 0.00 to 0.66, respectively. Five loci showed significant departures from the Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium and also exhibited signs of null alleles. Cross-amplification in other Cactaceae species was successful, ranging from one (Ferocactus latispinus, Cacteae and Harrisia adscendens, Trichocereeae) to twelve loci (Echinopsis calochlora, Trichocereeae). The development of these microsatellite markers will contribute to investigations of population structure, genetic diversity, and gene flow in E. rhodotricha populations, as well as in other cactus species, providing information useful for the creation and delimitation of conservation areas in the Brazilian Chaco region.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEchinopsis 3aFerocactus 3acacti and succulents 3aconservation areas 3adeforestation 3adry forests 3agene flow 3agenetic markers 3agenetic variation 3agenomic libraries 3aheterozygosity 3aloci 3amicrosatellite repeats 3anull alleles 3apastures 3apopulation structure 3athreatened species 3aEl Gran Chaco 3aSouth America 0aBrazilian Chaco 0aCactaceae 0aCross-amplification 0aEchinopsis rhodotricha 0aMicrosatellites 0aTrichocereeae1 aPaggi, Gecele Matos1 aZanella, Camila Martini1 aLorenz-Lemke, Aline Pedroso0 tBiochemical systematics and ecology.g2016 June, v. 66 p.19-23dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl45135x0305-19787nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bse.2016.02.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03711naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094024003700134040001800171100005900189245010100248300001600349506007600365506003100441520189300472592002802365596004502393506003702438650002002475650001702495650001802512650002202530650001902552650001602571650001702587650001902604650002602623650002002649650003002669650001402699650002502713650001602738651001702754651001402771651002402785653000902809653001402818653001402832653001802846700001902864700002002883700002502903773012402928856008403052852000903136655001203145IND60644314420221207091421.0200318e201908  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064431442DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ympev.2019.05.0042chorus7 a10.1016/j.ympev.2019.05.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMorero, Rita E.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5890-150410aHistorical biogeography of the fern genus Polystichum (Dryopteridaceae) in Austral South America  ap. 168-189.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCHORUS License Information  aA group of seven endemic Polystichum species inhabit Patagonia, the southern region of South America. To date, evolutionary relationships of these Austral South American Polystichum remain unknown. The biota of the Southern Andes appears to be more closely related to the temperate Australasian species than to northern South American ones. Differences in morphological characters suggested that Austral South American Polystichum follows that biogeographical pattern, not being closely related to their congeners in the Northern and Central Andes. We sought to reveal the evolutionary relationships, estimate the divergence times and reconstruct both ancestral areas and ancestral ploidy levels of Austral South America Polystichum. Phylogenetic relationships were estimated using maximum likelihood and Bayesian approaches. The seven Austral South American species plus 31 Polystichum species spanning all other major biogeographic regions were sampled for three DNA markers. Divergence times were estimated in BEAST and Bayesian binary Markov chain Monte Carlo reconstruction was applied in order to infer ancestral areas. The evolution of ploidy was reconstructed on the maximum clade credibility tree, using stochastic character mapping. Austral South American Polystichum was recovered as monophyletic. The earliest divergence reconstructed within the Austral South American Clade was that of Polystichum andinum; subsequently two other lineages diverged comprising the remaining Austral South American species. The Austral South American lineage is not closely allied to North and Central Andes congeners. Long-distance dispersal of an ancestral tetraploid from Australasia during the late Miocene is the most likely explanation for the origin of Patagonian Polystichum. Then, Pliocene and Pleistocene orogenic and climatic changes may have shaped its diversification in Patagonia.  aPublisher supplied data  cUSDAdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/1000001990 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aBayesian theory 3aMarkov chain 3aMiocene epoch 3aPleistocene epoch 3aPliocene epoch 3aPolystichum 3abiogeography 3aclimate change 3aferns and fern allies 3agenetic markers 3ageographical distribution 3amonophyly 3astatistical analysis 3atetraploidy 3aAndes region 3aArgentina 3aAustralasian region 0aFern 0aPhylogeny 0aPatagonia 0aSouth America1 aDeanna, Rocío1 aBarboza, G.

Sheep were treated with acaricide four times between March and October and double‐vaccinated against louping ill virus (LIV), instead of the conventional regime of two acaricide treatments and no vaccinations, on two moors in northern England. Enhanced treatment started at Westerdale Moor in 1995 and at Danby Moor in 2000; the latter had previously represented a spatial control site. From 1992 to 2003, grouse chick condition, tick burdens, reproductive success, shooting bags and LIV seroprevalence were measured. A total of 1297 grouse chicks from 398 broods were examined for ticks. Enhanced acaricide treatment reduced tick burdens by 90%, and LIV seroprevalence decreased in relation to the number of years since treatment began. Breeding success and post‐breeding densities of grouse in the current sample area remained unrelated to acaricide treatment, tick burdens or LIV seroprevalence, but 25% and 60% more grouse were shot on Westerdale and Danby, respectively, after treatment enhancement than before. By improving shooting bags, tick management schemes help to maintain the economic viability of grouse moors, which, in turn, provide upland landscape and wildlife benefits.  aPublisher supplied data 3aIxodes ricinus 3aLagopus lagopus scoticus 3aLouping ill virus 3aacaricides 3abags 3abreeding 3achicks 3aeconomics 3afarming systems 3aflocks 3agrouse 3aheathlands 3aseroprevalence 3asheep 3aticks 3aviability 3awildlife 2aAcaricidesxpharmacology 2aAnimals 2aBird Diseasesxparasitologyxprevention & control. 2aGalliformes 2aIxodesxdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aPopulation Dynamics 2aReproduction 2aSeroepidemiologic Studies 2aSheep 2aSheep Diseasesxepidemiologyxparasitologyxprevention & control. 2aTick Infestationsxprevention & controlxveterinary. 3aEngland1 aBAINES, D.0 tMedical and veterinary entomology.g2012 Mar., v. 26, no. 1 p.63-69dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0269-283X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2915.2011.00989.x  aDNAL 7aarticle01992naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245014200170300001800312520084000330592002801170650001001198650001301208650002001221650001701241650003901258650001901297650001701316700001801333700001901351700002001370700001801390700001601408773011101424856008601535852000901621655001201630IND60530424320221119111952.0160721e20160719xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053042432DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.analchem.6b013462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, Chae Yeong10aMitochondria-Targeting Chromogenic and Fluorescence Turn-On Probe for the Selective Detection of Cysteine by Caged Oxazolidinoindocyanine  ap. 7178-7182.  aWe report a chromogenic and fluorescence turn-on probe based on crotonoyl ester-functionalized oxazolidinoindole for the selective detection of cysteine in neutral buffer.

Accurate mapping of kudzu is critical for effective invasion control and management. However, the remote detection of kudzu distribution using multispectral images is challenging because of the mixed reflectance and potential misclassification with other vegetation. We propose a three-step classification process to map kudzu in Knox County, Tennessee, using multispectral Sentinel-2 images and the integration of spectral unmixing analysis and phenological characteristics. This classification includes an initial linear unmixing process to produce an overestimated kudzu map, a phenological-based masking to reduce misclassification, and a nonlinear unmixing process to refine the classification. The initial linear unmixing provides high producer’s accuracy (PA) but low user’s accuracy (UA) due to misclassification with grasslands. The phenological-based masking increases the accuracy of the kudzu classification and reduces the domain for further processing. The nonlinear unmixing further refines the kudzu classification via the selection of an appropriate nonlinear model. The final kudzu classification for Knox County reaches relatively high accuracy, with UA, PA, Jaccard, and Kappa index values of 0.858, 0.907, 0.789, and 0.725, respectively. Our proposed method has potential for continuous monitoring of kudzu in large areas.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPueraria montana var. lobata 3acase studies 3ainvasive species 3anonlinear models 3aphenology 3areflectance 3aremote sensing 3aTennessee1 aTang, Maofeng 1 aLi, Yingkui 0 tRemote Sensing.g2021 Nov. 12, v. 13, no. 22dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:26717x2072-42927nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs132245513Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02830naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002000152245011700172300001400289520132200303592002801625650002601653650001101679650001301690650001701703650001101720650001201731650001501743650001301758650001401771650005201785650006501837653001601902653001601918653002001934653001601954653002401970653000901994700001902003700005902022700001702081700002402098700002002122773011002142856008702252852000902339655001202348IND60628339520221120123037.0190202e201903  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062833952DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jviromet.2018.12.0192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTahzima, Rachid10aNew sensitive and fast detection of Little cherry virus 1 using loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP)  ap. 91-98.  aLittle cherry virus 1 (LChV-1) belongs to the genus Velarivirus, family Closteroviridae, is an economically important pathogen affecting mainly cherry around the world emphasizing the impetus for its efficient and accurate on-site detection. This study describes the development of a reliable diagnostic protocol of LChV-1 based on a one-step reverse-transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP). The protocol detects LChV-1 isolates in less than 10 min by fluorescence monitoring using a mobile detection device and is most optimal when performed at 67 °C. Sharp melting curves and unique melting temperatures (Tm) were obtained for the positive samples. Both the RT-LAMP and classical RT-PCR methods are capable of specifically detecting LChV-1 in infected leaf tissues. In addition, the RT-LAMP has remarkable advantages in comparison to RT-PCR. It is at least hundred fold more sensitive, significantly faster (allowing on-field leaf-to-result diagnostic) and efficient at minimal cost. In conclusion, this innovative RT-LAMP approach can contribute to the implementation of sustainable integrated management strategies for detection of LChV-1 in commercial orchards or for horticultural research stations. It is also suitable for decision support in phytosanitary epidemiological programs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLittle cherry virus 1 3aPrunus 3acherries 3afluorescence 3aleaves 3amelting 3amonitoring 3aorchards 3apathogens 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3areverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification 0aPlant virus 0aDiagnostics 0aClosteroviridae 0aVelarivirus 0aLittle cherry virus 0aLAMP1 aFoucart, Yoika1 aPeusens, Gertie1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5928-35841 aBeliën, Tim1 aMassart, Sébastien1 aDe Jonghe, Kris0 tJournal of virological methods.g2019 Mar., v. 265 p.91-98dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12356x0166-09347nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jviromet.2018.12.0193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03564naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100005700151245016500208520201800373592002802391650001702419650001102436650002302447650001602470650001602486650001502502650001302517650002002530650001002550651001002560653004002570653003402610653002602644653002302670653002502693700006402718700005902782700005802841700002202899773011402921856008603035852000903121655001203130IND60780594120221119013009.0221004e20220910xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078059412DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2022.1327352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSingh, Kulvir1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4128-710310aWater footprint assessment of surface and subsurface drip fertigated cotton-wheat cropping system – A case study under semi-arid environments of Indian Punjab  aThe advanced methods of irrigation and nutrient supply may save huge quantity of costly inputs over the prevalent practice of surface flood (SF) irrigation and fertilizer broadcasting in Indian Punjab. Surface drip fertigation (SDF) and subsurface drip fertigation (SSDF) enables the combined application of fertilizer and irrigation for improving the input use efficiency in Cotton-Wheat cropping system (CWCS) over the SF. Though, both SDF and SSDF perform better than SF, but their suitability in reducing the water footprint (WF) of CWCS has been least assessed. Therefore, a 2 yr field study at two distinct agro-climatic zones has been conducted to quantify and compare the WF of SDF and SSDF in comparison to SF for CWCS under semi-arid environments. Results revealed that under SSDF, cotton and wheat crops consumed 32 and 37% lower water than respective SF, indicative of huge water saving over the prevalent practice. Contribution of green, blue and grey components towards total WF under SF was 42, 48 and 10% respectively for cotton, and 24, 59 and 18% for wheat. SSDF application at 80% crop evapotranspiration (ETc) along with 100% recommended dose of nitrogen remarkably reduced the WF without any yield loss for CWCS. Higher total WF for CWCS under SF (5.30 m³ kg⁻¹) revealed it to be inferior as compared to SDF (3.71 m³ kg⁻¹) and SSDF (3.52 m³ kg⁻¹). Cotton alone consumed 65–78% of WFₜₒₜₐₗ of the CWCS, while the remaining 22–35% was attributed to wheat. A lowered WFₜₒₜₐₗ for CWCS under SDF and SSDF over that of SF elucidated them to be immensely helpful to conserve limited water resources under semi arid climates. A cropping system based assessment was much reliable option to obtain a clear indicator about the annual WF as compared to single crop based estimation. These results could be utilized to access the performance of alternative irrigation and cultivation systems for developing the WF reduction approach over extended geographical scale.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase studies 3acotton 3aevapotranspiration 3afertigation 3afertilizers 3airrigation 3anitrogen 3awater footprint 3awheat 3aIndia 0aCotton-wheat cropping system (CWCS) 0aCrop evapotranspiration (ETc) 0aDrip fertigation (DF) 0aSurface flood (SF) 0aWater footprint (WF)1 aMishra, Sudhir Kumar1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0567-30581 aSingh, Manpreet1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3387-08301 aSingh, Kuldeep1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4128-71031 aBrar, Ajmer Singh0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2022 Sept. 10, v. 365 p.132735-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2022.1327353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02209naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245013900169300001800308520071500326592002801041650002201069650001401091650001601105650001901121650002001140650001101160653000801171653000801179653000801187653000901195653000901204653000801213653000901221653000701230653000901237653000801246653000801254653002001262653001801282653000701300653001901307653002201326653002101348700002001369700002201389700001801411773015501429856008601584852000901670655001201679IND60539253220221117224414.0190215e20140318xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053925322DNAL7 a10.1016/j.febslet.2014.02.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aThaa, Bastian10aAcylation and cholesterol binding are not required for targeting of influenza A virus M2 protein to the hemagglutinin-defined budozone  ap. 1031-1036.  aInfluenza virus assembles in the budozone, a cholesterol-/sphingolipid-enriched (“raft”) domain at the apical plasma membrane, organized by hemagglutinin (HA). The viral protein M2 localizes to the budozone edge for virus particle scission. This was proposed to depend on acylation and cholesterol binding. We show that M2–GFP without these motifs is still transported apically in polarized cells. Employing FRET, we determined that clustering between HA and M2 is reduced upon disruption of HA’s raft-association features (acylation, transmembranous VIL motif), but remains unchanged with M2 lacking acylation and/or cholesterol-binding sites. The motifs are thus irrelevant for M2 targeting in cells.  aPublisher supplied data 3aInfluenza A virus 3aacylation 3acholesterol 3ahemagglutinins 3aplasma membrane 3avirion 0aCer 0aCHO 0aDRM 0aFLIM 0aFRET 0aGFP 0aGPMV 0aHA 0aMDCK 0aTMD 0aYFP 0aInfluenza virus 0aHemagglutinin 0aM2 0aPalmitoylation 0aRaft localization 0aApical transport1 aSiche, Stefanie1 aHerrmann, Andreas1 aVeit, Michael0 tFEBS letters.g2014 Mar. 18, v. 588, no. 6 p.1031-1036dElsevier B.V.aFederation of European Biochemical SocietieswJournal:jnl16404x0014-57937nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.febslet.2014.02.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03009naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001800142245007200160300001600232520193700248592002802185650001902213650002002232650001602252650002302268650002402291650001702315650002402332650001002356650001402366651001902380700002002399700001302419773012902432856007702561852000902638655001202647IND60765390620221121080913.0220422e20140603xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076539062DNAL7 a10.17221/66/2013-jfs2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMartiník, A.10aComparison of different forest regeneration methods after windthrow  ap. 190-197.  aThe prosperity of various forest regeneration methods was evaluated on the prepared windthrow area established in 2010 in a previously allochthonous coniferous stand growing in mid-elevations of the Czech Republic. The forest regeneration variants were as follows: (1) &ldquo;planting&rdquo; of target species (Picea abies [L.] Karst.) and Fagus sylvatica (L.), (2) &ldquo;seeding&rdquo; of pioneer (non target) species (Betula pendula Roth) and (3) spontaneous &ldquo;succession&rdquo;. Two years after windthrow&nbsp;&nbsp; the &ldquo;planting&rdquo; was evaluated in accordance with the Czech forestry law as&nbsp; regeneration method with&nbsp; sufficient attributes, density (6,000&ndash;9,000 indd&middot;ha<sup>&ndash;1</sup>) and regular spatial distribution of target tree species. The &ldquo;seeding&rdquo; and &ldquo;succession&rdquo; variants showed a insufficient attributes of target tree species &ndash; total density <br /> ca 3,000 indd&middot;ha<sup>&ndash;1</sup> (being ca 1,000 indd&middot;ha<sup>&ndash;1</sup> higher than 20 cm) and irregular distribution across the plot. The non-target species birch on the &ldquo;seeding&rdquo; variant showed a high density of plants (131,000 indd&middot;ha<sup>&ndash;1</sup>) being eight times higher than the succession variant. The cost of the regeneration treatment was different between the variants &ndash; planting: 5,000&ndash;6,000 EUR&middot;ha<sup>&ndash;1</sup>, 1,300 EUR&middot;ha<sup>&ndash;1</sup>, succession: 1,000 EUR&middot;ha<sup>&ndash;1</sup>.

The protein component accounts for 100–130 g/kg of the seeds in weight. However, so far, there is no information on the composition and function of the pomegranate seed proteins. In this study, a global view of water-soluble non-storage proteins isolated from mature pomegranate seeds were studied using two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis coupled with liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry. With the two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis approach, over 120 protein spots were resolved, of which 7 abundant protein spots showing low molecular mass were identified. These identified proteins may be linked to seed development and metabolism, but more importantly, the occurrence of these proteins provides the possibility of conversion the pomegranate processing wastes into useful products or raw material for food industry.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPunica granatum 3afood industry 3aliquid chromatography 3ametabolism 3amolecular weight 3apomegranates 3aprocessing waste 3aproteins 3araw materials 3aseed development 3aseeds 3atandem mass spectrometry 3atwo-dimensional gel electrophoresis 3awater solubility 0aPomegranate seeds 0awastes 0aproteins1 aLi, Meiliang1 aQi, Xin1 aLv, Chenyan1 aDeng, Jianjun1 aZhao, Guanghua0 tFood science and technology international.g, v. 18, no. 4 p.329-338dSAGE PublicationswJournal:jnl3949853x1082-01327nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/10820132114280083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02315naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001700153245007600170300001600246520111600262592002801378650002901406650001201435650001501447650001801462650001401480650002001494650001701514650001701531650001301548650000901561650001501570653001201585653000901597653003501606653002701641700001501668700001401683773010001697856008701797852000901884655001201893IND60611146620221121024527.0180830e201702  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061114662DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apgeochem.2016.05.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhou, Qixing12aA study on soil-environmental quality criteria and standards of arsenic  ap. 158-166.  aArsenic (As) originating from natural and anthropogenic sources is an ubiquitous metalloid in soils, and can pose potential risks on human health and ecosystems.

Secondly, we summarized the methods of deriving As soil-environmental quality criteria, respectively, based on its soil-environmental background values, ecotoxicological effects, accumulation, exposure models and soil-water partition equations. Thirdly, we reckoned and assessed the quantitative or qualitative relationships of As soil-environmental quality standards in various countries and regions according to land uses, tiers and extractants.

Epitaxial structures based on strontium ruthenate (SRO) and TiO₂ have demonstrated unexpectedly high activity under visible-light-only illumination because of strong absorption by the SRO, high electrical conductivity, and the ability to inject hot electrons into the active TiO₂ photocatalyst. The role of photoholes, the mechanisms of carrier transport to the TiO₂ surface, and the necessity of an epitaxial structure remain unclear. The present work helps to fill these gaps through rate measurements of methylene blue (MB) photooxidation on SRO–TiO₂ under visible light, together with photoemission measurements of interfacial and free surface band edges of the TiO₂. Diffusive transport of thermalized holes appears sufficient to explain the results, and surprisingly, a heterojunction based on amorphous SRO and TiO₂ retains a great deal of the metallic properties of crystalline SRO and provides MB degradation rates comparable to an equivalent heteroepitaxial structure reported previously. These findings relax considerably the constraints on translating heterojunctions based on correlated metal oxides into photocatalytic applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3aelectrical conductivity 3aelectrons 3alighting 3amethylene blue 3aphotocatalysis 3aphotocatalysts 3aphotooxidation 3asolar radiation 3astrontium 3atitanium dioxide1 aSeebauer, Edmund G.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4722-39010 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2018 June 16, v. 122, no. 27 p.15688-15695dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23573x1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.7b126593Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01374naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245006400166300001600230520041000246592002800656650002700684650001700711650001500728650001500743650001600758650001400774700002300788700001400811700001600825773011400841856008400955852000901039655001201048IND60112754720221120210559.0141111e201110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011275472DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jbiosc.2011.06.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZi, Jiachen10aMetabolism of quercetin by Cunninghamella elegans ATCC 9245  ap. 360-362.  aIncubation of quercetin with Cunninghamella elegans ATCC 9245 yielded three metabolites, including quercetin 3-O-β-D-glucopyranoside, kaempferol 3-O-β-D-glucopyranoside and isorhamnetin 3-O-β-D-glucopyranoside.

Effective action starts with good knowledge of the ocean dynamics and circulation, from which Lagrangian methods derive key information on the dispersal pathways present in the contaminated region. However, precise assessments of the capacity of Lagrangian methods in real contamination cases remain rare and limited to large slicks spanning several hundreds of km. Here we address this knowledge gap and consider two medium-scale (tens of km wide) events of oil in contrasting conditions: an offshore case (East China Sea, 2018) and a recent near-coastal one (East Mediterranean, 2021). Our comparison between oil slicks and Lagrangian diagnostics derived from near-real-time velocity fields shows that the calculation of Lagrangian fronts is, in general, more robust to errors in the velocity fields and more informative on the dispersion pathways than the direct advection of a numerical tracer. The inclusion of the effect of wind is also found to be essential, being capable of suddenly breaking Lagrangian transport barriers. Finally, we show that a usually neglected Lagrangian quantity, the Lyapunov vector, can be exploited to predict the front drifting speed, and in turn, its future location over a few days, on the basis of near-real-time information alone. These results may be of special relevance in the context of next-generation altimetry missions that are expected to provide highly resolved and precise near-real-time velocity fields for both open ocean and coastal regions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadvection 3aaltimetry 3adiagnostic techniques 3aoil spills 3aoils 3apublic health 3asocioeconomics 3awind 3aEast China Sea1 aBaudena, Alberto 1 aFakhri, Milad 1 aBaaklini, Georges 1 aFaugère, Yannice 1 aMorrow, Rosemary 1 aMortier, Laurent 1 ad’Ovidio, Francesco 0 tRemote Sensing.g2021 Nov. 09, v. 13, no. 22dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:26717x2072-42927nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs132244993Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02898naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002000139245021200159300001800371520132500389592002801714650001901742650001501761650001501776650002301791650001001814650001001824650001901834650001001853650001501863650001901878650001301897650001301910650001501923653003201938653003901970653001002009653002202019700001702041700002102058700001902079700001602098700002102114700002102135700001802156773013402174856007502308852000902383655001202392IND60567924320221118102542.0170501e20121102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056792432DNAL7 a10.1021/pr300362g2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Yinghua,10aComparative Secretome Analyses Using a Hollow Fiber Culture System with Label-Free Quantitative Proteomics Indicates the Influence of PARK7 on Cell Proliferation and Migration/Invasion in Lung Adenocarcinoma  ap. 5167-5185.  aAs the leading cause of cancer death worldwide, lung cancer lacks effective diagnosis tools and treatments to prevent its metastasis. Fortunately, secretome has clinical usages as biomarkers and protein drugs. To discover the secretome that influences lung adenocarcinoma metastasis, the hollow fiber culture (HFC) system was used along with label-free proteomics approach to analyze cell secretomes between CL1-0 and CL1-5 cell lines, which exhibit low and high metastatic potentials. Among the 703 proteins quantified, 50 possessed different levels between CL1-0 and CL1-5. PARK7 was a primary focus because of the lack of research involving lung adenocarcinoma. The cell proliferation, migration, and invasion properties of CL1-0, CL1-5, and A549 cells were significantly diminished when the expression of their PARK7 proteins was reduced. Conversely, these functions were promoted when PARK7 was overexpressed in CL1-0. In clinical expression, PARK7 levels within tissue specimens and plasma samples were significantly higher in the cancer group. This represents the first time the HFC system has been used with label-free quantification to discern the elements of metastasis in lung adenocarcinoma cell secretomes. Likewise, PARK7 has never been researched for its role in promoting lung adenocarcinoma progression.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadenocarcinoma 3abiomarkers 3acell lines 3acell proliferation 3adeath 3adrugs 3alung neoplasms 3alungs 3ametastasis 3aneoplasm cells 3aproteins 3aproteome 3aproteomics 0ahollow fiber culture system 0alabel-free quantitative proteomics 0aPARK7 0acancer metastasis1 aLee, Shu-Hui1 aChang, Hua-Chien1 aTseng, Yau-Lin1 aLai, Wu-Wei1 aLiao, Chen-Chung1 aTsay, Yeou-Guang1 aLiao, Pao-Chi0 tJournal of Proteome Research.g2012 Nov. 02, v. 11, no. 11 p.5167-5185dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23605x1535-39077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fpr300362g3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03126naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002400147245011500171300001600286520137700302592002801679650001301707650001701720650002301737650001501760650001601775650001301791650002201804650002501826650001801851650001901869650001401888650004101902650001501943650002201958650001301980650001701993650001302010650001102023650002302034651001902057651001002076653002302086653001502109653001802124653001202142653001302154653002302167700003402190700002102224700002402245700005802269773011802327856008202445852000902527655001202536IND60525898120221116150608.0190401e201604  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052589812DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bse.2016.02.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZorzetto, Christian10aChemical analysis of the essential oils from Schizogyne sericea growing in different areas of Tenerife (Spain)  ap. 192-197.  aSchizogyne sericea, also known as ‘salado’, is a halophytic species widespread throughout all the Canary Islands (Spain), being more common in Tenerife and Gran Canaria. The plant has been traditionally used as analgesic, astringent, anti-inflammatory and vulnerary. The aim of this work was to investigate the chemical variability in the volatile profiles obtained from the flowering aerial parts of S. sericea harvested in different localities (Palm Mar, Los Roques and La Barranquera) of Tenerife characterized by different microclimates. For the purpose, the essential oils were hydrodistilled from the dried aerial parts by a Clevenger-type apparatus and analysed by GC–MS. A similar chemical composition for the essential oil samples from the different geographic areas was obtained. The aromatic monoterpene hydrocarbon p-cymene (43.0–57.0%) was by far the main component of the essential oils, with minor amounts of isobornyl acetate (4.5–11.0%), limonene (4.7–5.6%), β-pinene (0.7–5.3%), α-phellandrene (2.2–4.8%) and camphene (1.8–4.5%). Interesting to note was the occurrence of thymol derivatives. That may be considered important chemotaxonomic markers of the genus Schizogyne, and, more in general, of the tribe Inulae. The volatile chemical profile obtained for S. sericea was similar to that of Schizogyne glaberrima previously studied.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetates 3aaerial parts 3aalpha-phellandrene 3aanalgesics 3abeta-pinene 3acamphene 3achemical analysis 3achemical composition 3achemotaxonomy 3aessential oils 3aflowering 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3ahalophytes 3ahydrodistillation 3alimonene 3amicroclimate 3ap-cymene 3athymol 3avolatile compounds 3aCanary Islands 3aSpain 0aSchizogyne sericea 0aAsteraceae 0aEssential oil 0aGC–MS 0ap-cymene 0aThymol derivatives1 aSánchez-Mateo, Candelaria C.1 aRabanal, Rosa M.1 aIannarelli, Romilde1 aMaggi, Filippo1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1375-47440 tBiochemical systematics and ecology.g2016 Apr., v. 65 p.192-197dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl45135x0305-19787nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bse.2016.02.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02773naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100001600137245012800153300001600281520148100297592002801778650004101806650001101847650001901858650005001877650001401927650000901941650001701950650002301967650002101990650001802011650001802029650001502047651002002062653003202082653003202114653000802146653002202154653001002176653001002186773008402196856003802280852000902318655001202327IND50074865320221119083609.0140410s2014    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007486532DNAL7 a10.1071/SR132972doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Xihua10aDeriving RUSLE cover factor from time-series fractional vegetation cover for hillslope erosion modelling in New South Wales  ap. 253-261.  aSoil loss due to water erosion, in particular hillslope erosion, can be estimated using predictive models such as the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE). One of the important and dynamic elements in the RUSLE model is the cover and management factor (C-factor), which represents effects of vegetation canopy and ground cover in reducing soil loss. This study explores the potential for using fractional vegetation cover, rather than traditional green vegetation indices (e.g. NDVI), to estimate C-factor and consequently hillslope erosion hazard across New South Wales (NSW), Australia. Values of the C-factor were estimated from the emerging time-series fractional cover products derived from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). Time-series C-factor and hillslope erosion maps were produced for NSW on monthly and annual bases for a 13-year period from 2000 to 2012 using automated scripts in a geographic information system. The estimated C-factor time-series values were compared with previous study and field measurements in NSW revealing good consistency in both spatial and temporal contexts. Using these time-series maps, the relationship was analysed between ground cover and hillslope erosion and their temporal variation across NSW. Outcomes from this time-series study are being used to assess hillslope erosion hazard, sediment and water quality (particularly after severe bushfires) across NSW at local, catchment and regional scales.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRevised Universal Soil Loss Equation 3acanopy 3aimage analysis 3amoderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer 3asediments 3asoil 3aspatial data 3atemporal variation 3avegetation cover 3awater erosion 3awater quality 3awatersheds 3aNew South Wales 0acover and management factor 0afractional vegetation cover 0aGIS 0ahillslope erosion 0aMODIS 0aRUSLE0 tSoil research.g2014, v. 52, no. 3 p.253-261dCSIRO Publishingx1838-675X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1071/SR13297  aDNAL 7aarticle03602naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100005800151245008600209520257400295592002802869650002802897650000902925650002802934653002202962653001902984653001503003653001203018653001503030653003403045773011403079856008603193852000903279655001203288IND60780594720221119013132.0221004e20220910xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078059472DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2022.1327542doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlbert, Martin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7233-990610aAssessing the sustainability impacts of frugal innovation – A literature review  aFrugal innovation can help to foster sustainability and address global challenges, like building economic growth, addressing various social needs, and protecting the environment. However, if one wants to measure the sustainability impacts of frugal innovation or enable companies to make empirically informed decisions between frugal and alternative innovation, the question of how to assess these empirical impacts arises. The main objectives of this paper are the identification of approaches and indicators for assessing the sustainability impacts of frugal innovation and the analysis of empirical findings relating to prior assessments. To this end, a systematic literature review was conducted, which identified 15 texts, and a qualitative content analysis was employed to evaluate their contents. From these analyses two main approaches for assessment emerged. First, the assessment based on the triple bottom line or the dimensions of sustainability (ecological, social, and economic). Second, assessment against the Sustainability Development Goals. In the identified texts, the sustainability dimensions are preferred over the Sustainable Development Goals for assessing the sustainability impacts of frugal innovation. From the 15 identified texts, 13 use qualitative indicators and two quantitative (conceptual) indicators. To answer the research question of the paper, a set of 47 qualitative indicators relating to integrated dimensions of sustainability for the assessment of the sustainability impacts of frugal innovation is proposed. In addition, this paper presents new insights relating to the empirical evidence of sustainability impacts of frugal innovation. Approximately 60% of 334 empirical findings from 70 different cases related to the Sustainable Development Goals contribute to the five (socially and economically focused) SDGs 8, 3, 10, 12, and 9. After a transformation to the Triple Bottom Line, these findings contribute predominantly to the economic and social dimensions (in each case 45%), and only slightly to the ecological dimension (the remaining 10%). In turn, 164 empirical results from 77 different cases related to the Triple Bottom Line show an almost similar contribution to all three sustainability dimensions with a small lead of the economic dimension. Nonetheless, in the opinion of the author, these findings confirm other studies, that from an empirical perspective, frugal innovation can be described as inherently socially and economically sustainable and ecological sustainability is mostly not the primary focus.  aPublisher supplied data 3aeconomic sustainability 3alead 3asustainable development 0aFrugal innovation 0aSustainability 0aIndicators 0aImpacts 0aDimensions 0aSustainable Development Goals0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2022 Sept. 10, v. 365 p.132754-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2022.1327543Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03920naa a2200901 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002000152245008600172300001400258520124300272592002801515650002601543650001601569650002201585650001801607650002201625650001101647650001401658650001401672650001301686650001501699650002401714650001801738653002601756653001401782653000901796653001601805653002301821653002201844700006801866700002201934700003301956700001701989700002202006700001802028700002402046700003002070700002102100700003302121700002002154700002802174700002502202700002402227700001802251700002602269700001702295700002802312700001702340700001702357700001902374700002002393700001702413700002202430700003002452700002602482700002302508700001902531700002102550700002102571700003102592700003102623700002002654700001802674700002002692700001902712700002002731700003102751700001802782710002402800773008602824856008702910852000902997655001203006IND60644315120221122222741.0190606e201906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064431512DNAL7 a10.1016/j.anaerobe.2019.04.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCózar, Alberto10aHigh delayed mortality after the first episode of Clostridium difficile infection  ap. 93-98.  aClostridium difficile infection (CDI) is characterized by a high delayed and unrelated mortality. Predicting delayed mortality in CDI patients could allow the implementation of interventions that could reduce these events. A prospective multicentric study was carried out to investigate prognostic factors associated with mortality. It was based on a cohort (July 2015 to February 2016) of 295 patients presenting with CDI. Logistic regression was used and the model was calibrated using the Hosmer-Lemeshow test.The mortality rate at 75 days in our series was 18%. Age (>65 years), comorbidity (defined by heart failure, diabetes mellitus with any organ lesion, renal failure, active neoplasia or immunosuppression) and fecal incontinence at clinical presentation were associated with delayed (75-day) mortality. When present, each of the aforementioned variables added one point to the score. Mortalities with 0, 1, 2 and 3 points were 0%, 9.4%, 18.5% and 38.2%, respectively. The area under the ROC curve was 0.743, and the Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test p value was 0.875. Therefore, the prediction of high delayed mortality in CDI patients by our scoring system could promote measures for increasing survival in suitable cases.  aPublisher supplied data 3aClostridium difficile 3acomorbidity 3adiabetes mellitus 3aheart failure 3aimmunosuppression 3amodels 3amortality 3aneoplasms 3apatients 3aprediction 3aregression analysis 3arenal failure 0aClostridium difficile 0aMortality 0aAged 0aComorbidity 0aFecal incontinence 0aImmunosuppression1 aRamos-Martínez, Antonio1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4840-94251 aMerino, Esperanza1 aMartínez -García, Cristina1 aShaw, Evelyn1 aMarrodán, Teresa1 aCalbo, Esther1 aBereciartúa, Elena1 aSánchez- Muñoz, Luis A.1 aSalavert, Miguel1 aPérez-Rodríguez, M.

Bugs fed prey (Heliothis eggs) and parts of cotton plants (tips or squares) developed faster than bugs fed cotton alone and faster than bugs provided only with prey. Survival and fecundity was also higher on the mixed diet. Bugs exposed to cotton seedlings or squares did cause damage (which is described), but the amount of damage per bug was low. C. livida therefore has the potential to damage early‐season cotton in eastern Australia, but its potential for damaging cotton crops requires further investigation. Interpretation of C. livida ecology on cotton will require a better understanding of the species status of the taxon C. livida, and a better understanding of its host plant relationships.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCampylomma 3acotton 3adiet 3afecundity 3ahost plants 3aseedlings 3aecology 3aHeliothis 3aeggs 3acrops 3aAustralia 0aHemiptera1 aWalter, G.

However, these two goals are often associated with different sectoral policy instruments. While so−called payments for environmental services (PES) are increasingly being promoted for environmental protection, poverty alleviation is increasingly addressed by conditional cash transfers (CCT) program. These instruments although aimed to achieve distinct objectives have a number of similarities and challenges in their design and implementation phases. This paper elaborates on these similarities and develops a unifying generic framework that is used to discuss the extent to which both approaches could be unified.  aPublisher supplied data 3adeveloping countries 3aecosystem services 3aenvironmental protection 3alearning 3apoverty 3apublic policy1 aPascual, Unai1 aMuradian, Roldan1 aPazmino, Nathalie1 aWhitten, Stuart0 tEcological economics.g2011 Sept. 15, v. 70, no. 11 p.2163-2174dElsevier B.V.x0921-80097nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolecon.2011.06.0193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02751naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245013500165300001600300520137500316592002801691650001501719650001001734650001601744650002001760650002601780650002201806650001801828650001301846650001101859650003001870650001401900653003101914653002001945653002201965653003101987700001602018700001602034700001802050700001902068700001802087773009702105856008202202852000902284655001202293IND60553381820221121235051.0161021e20140915xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055338182DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bios.2014.03.0482doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTan, Kanghui10aFacet dependent binding and etching: Ultra-sensitive colorimetric visualization of blood uric acid by unmodified silver nanoprisms  ap. 227-232.  aBy combination of experiments and density functional theory calculations, we present a simple but effective “facet dependent binding and etching” strategy for non-enzymatic and non-aggregated colorimetric sensing of blood uric acid (UA), using unmodified Ag nanoprisms as the signal readout. In the absence of UA, the triangular Ag nanoprisms are etched alongside (110) facets by H2O2 and form round nanodiscs, and a more than 160nm surface plasmon resonance (SPR) blue shift is observed. Because of special affinity between UA and side facets of the Ag nanoprisms, pre-added UA can well protect the Ag nanoprisms from etching. Such protection effect can be used for well quantifying UA in the range of 10–3000nM, based on the inverse proportion of the SPR blue shift with the added analyte. Due to very thin plate morphology (5nm) and facet dependent binding/etching effects of the Ag nanoprisms, the sensing system has ultrahigh sensitivity. The detection limit is only 10nM, which is about 2 to 4 orders of magnitude lower than that of previous colorimetric sensing systems. In addition to accurate quantitation, the proposed strategy can conveniently discriminate the patient of hyperuricemia from normal person by naked eyes. So, the present simple, low-cost and visualized UA chemosensor has great potential in the applications for point-of-care diagnostics.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiosensors 3ablood 3acolorimetry 3adetection limit 3adiagnostic techniques 3ahydrogen peroxide 3ahyperuricemia 3apatients 3asilver 3asurface plasmon resonance 3auric acid 0aColorimetric visualization 0aBlood uric acid 0aSilver nanoprisms 0aFacet-dependent properties1 aYang, Guang1 aChen, Huide1 aShen, Pengfei1 aHuang, Yucheng1 aXia, Yunsheng0 tBiosensors & bioelectronics.g2014 Sept. 15, v. 59 p.227-232dElsevier B.V.x0956-56637nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bios.2014.03.0483Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03134naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006000148245013900208300001600347520159200363592002801955596019501983650001202178650001902190650003602209650002302245650001902268650001502287650001502302651001002317651001402327651001702341700002002358700002002378700002102398700002302419700001602442700002002458700001802478773011302496856008202609852000902691655001202700IND60701697320221120055733.0200714e202006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070169732DNAL7 a10.1007/s10584-019-02448-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTàbara, J David1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3086-541410aMicro-solutions to global problems: understanding social processes to eradicate energy poverty and build climate-resilient livelihoods  ap. 711-725.  aThis research explores the agent dynamics, learning processes, and enabling conditions for the implementation of microscale win-win solutions that contribute to energy poverty eradication and climate resilience in a selection of low-income rural and peri-urban communities in India, Indonesia, and South Africa. We define these micro-solutions as energy-related interventions and resilience services or products—used at community, household, small production unit, or business level—that yield both economic and climatic gains. Our analysis identifies five elements critical for the robust design of these interventions: (i) The ability to collaborate and share different kinds of expertise with a range of networks operating at multiple levels of activity; (ii) The application of place-based systems-learning perspectives that enable project participants to integrate different types of solutions to meet different needs at the same time; (iii) The ability to yield tangible short-term benefits as part of long-term strategic visions and commitment; (iv) The use of novel technologies and financial instruments in ways that foreground the needs of poor populations; and (v) The inclusion and empowerment of economically marginalised groups through institutional and technological innovations and responsible business models. We conclude that the most critical aspect of successful micro win-win solutions is support for communities’ own endogenous transformative capacities as this helps ensure that solutions are shared and continuously adapted to changing conditions over time.  aPublisher supplied data  aGrant Agreement No 642018.cEuropean Union’s Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Programme on Societal Challenge 5 ‘Climate action, environment, resource efficiency and raw materials’ 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3acorporate social responsibility 3aeconometric models 3aenergy poverty 3alivelihood 3atechnology 3aIndia 3aIndonesia 3aSouth Africa1 aTakama, Takeshi1 aMishra, Manisha1 aHermanus, Lauren1 aAndrew, Sean Khaya1 aDiaz, Pacia1 aZiervogel, Gina1 aLemkow, Luis,0 tClimatic change.g2020 June, v. 160, no. 4 p.711-725dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl8952x0165-00097nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10584-019-02448-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02588naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001600140245010700156300001600263520157200279592002801851650002301879650001901902650001501921650002201936650001701958650002901975650001702004650001602021700001702037773012502054856007402179852000902253655001202262IND60638342420221117221957.0190429e20160121xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063834242DNAL7 a10.1039/c5ay02549d2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCuss, C. W.10aAnalysis of dissolved organic matter fluorescence using self-organizing maps: mini-review and tutorial  ap. 716-725.  aThe analysis of dissolved organic matter (DOM) fluorescence has facilitated tracing throughout both natural and engineered aquatic systems, and the connection of DOM quality to its effectiveness as a binding agent, nutrient source, and generator of disinfection byproducts. While methods that deconvolute fluorescence into distinct underlying components have been instrumental in this endeavour, the vast majority of subsequent analyses has been limited to isolated parts/components, whereas DOM is a complex and dynamic system of interacting molecules. Tools for pattern recognition such as Kohonen's self-organizing maps (SOMs) are capable of analyzing DOM fluorescence holistically, either by recomposing the parts isolated via PARAFAC, or by analyzing fluorescence in its entirety; however, the SOM has been underutilized in this endeavour, largely due to the difficulty of implementation and optimization. This report briefly summarizes the prior application of the SOM to DOM fluorescence, followed by a brief introduction to its theory and utility. An instructional tutorial and user-friendly ‘Fluor_SOmap’ Matlab package have been included to assist researchers in implementing SOMs. Four modes of fluorescence data analysis are facilitated by the package, including: whole EEMs, excitation–emission wavelength pairs, component scores from PARAFAC, and overall fluorescence composition. It is hoped that this tutorial and the associated package will help researchers implement and interpret SOMs to extend the scope and utility of fluorescence analysis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanalytical methods 3abinding agents 3abyproducts 3acomputer software 3adisinfection 3adissolved organic matter 3afluorescence 3awavelengths1 aGuéguen, C.0 tAnalytical methods.g2016 Jan. 21, v. 8, no. 4 p.716-725dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26912x1759-96797nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c5ay02549d3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02537naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100001200184245004100196300001600237506007600253520131300329592002801642506003701670650001401707650001701721650001401738650001101752650001501763650001101778700001601789700001801805700001901823700001801842700001601860773017101876856008302047852000902130655001202139IND4487040320221207082034.0120502e20120117xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448704032DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.11193751092doi7 aPMC32718932pmcid7 a222155892pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhu, Li10aSpiral chain O4 form of dense oxygen  ap. 751-753.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aOxygen is in many ways a unique element: It is the only known diatomic molecular magnet, and it exhibits an unusual O8 cluster in its high-pressure solid phase. Pressure-induced molecular dissociation as one of the fundamental problems in physical sciences has been reported from theoretical or experimental studies of diatomic solids H2, N2, F2, Cl2, Br2, and I2 but remains elusive for molecular oxygen. We report here the prediction of the dissociation of molecular oxygen into a polymeric spiral chain O4 structure (space group I41/acd, {theta}-O4) above 1.92-TPa pressure using the particle-swarm search method. The {theta}-O4 phase has a similar structure as the high-pressure phase III of sulfur. The molecular bonding in the insulating Îµ-O8 phase or the isostructural superconducting Î¶-O8 phase remains remarkably stable over a large pressure range of 0.008â1.92Â TPa. The pressure-induced softening of a transverse acoustic phonon mode at the zone boundary V point of O8 phase might be the ultimate driving force for the formation of {theta}-O4. Stabilization of {theta}-O4 turns oxygen from a superconductor into an insulator by opening a wide band gap (approximately 5.9Â eV) that originates from the sp3-like hybridized orbitals of oxygen and the localization of valence electrons.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aacoustics 3adissociation 3aelectrons 3aoxygen 3aprediction 3asulfur1 aWang, Ziwei1 aWang, Yanchao1 aZou, Guangtian1 aMao, Ho-kwang1 aMa, Yanming0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2012 Jan. 17, v. 109, no. 3 p.751-753dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.11193751093Available from publisher's Web site  aDNAL 7aarticle02253naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001400152245009700166300001600263520097400279592002801253650001601281650002401297650002101321650003201342650001101374650001401385650001401399650002001413650001101433653002801444653001701472653001801489653002301507653002501530700001901555700001601574700001601590700001701606773010001623856008701723852000901810655001201819IND60610914720221120181903.0190402e20170415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061091472DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2016.10.1082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Pei10aComparative study on the freeze stability of yeast and chemical leavened steamed bread dough  ap. 482-488.  aThe present study comparatively evaluated the evolution of yeast and chemical leavened steamed bread dough (YLD/CLD) quality during freeze/thaw (FT) cycles. The steamed bread quality of CLD was more freeze-stable than that of the YLD after 3 FT cycles. Decreased yeast viability contributed to the loss of gassing power in YLD while no significant differences were observed for CLD during FT cycles. However, faster gas release rate in frozen CLD indicated gas retention loss due to the distortion of gluten network. Glutenin macropolymers (GMP) depolymerization via breakage of inter-chain disulfide (SS) bonds and conversions of α-helix and β-turn to β-sheet structures were the main indicators of gluten deterioration. Gluten network was more vulnerable in frozen YLD, resulting in detectable loss of viscoelasticity. The results suggested that supplement of chemical leavener contributed to a more freeze-tolerant gluten network besides its stable gassing power.  aPublisher supplied data 3abread dough 3abreadmaking quality 3adepolymerization 3agas production (biological) 3agluten 3aglutenins 3aviability 3aviscoelasticity 3ayeasts 0aYeast/chemical leavener 0aFrozen dough 0aSteamed bread 0aGassing properties 0aGluten deterioration1 aYang, Runqiang1 aGu, Zhenxin1 aXu, Xueming1 aJin, Zhengyu0 tFood chemistry.g2017 Apr. 15, v. 221 p.482-488dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8139x0308-81467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2016.10.1083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02294naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001700139245008800156300001600244500001500260520116700275592002801442650001301470650001901483650000901502650001301511650001301524650001001537650002501547653002601572653002101598653002601619653001201645700002201657700002401679773012101703856007501824852000901899655001201908IND60527434720221120230627.0160715e20130109xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052743472DNAL7 a10.1021/am302426e2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Dawei10aInorganic–Organic Shape Memory Polymer (SMP) Foams with Highly Tunable Properties  ap. 186-191.  a2019-12-06  aThermoresponsive shape memory polymers (SMPs) are a class of smart materials that can return from a temporary to a permanent shape with the application of heat. Porous SMP foams exhibit unique properties versus solid, nonporous SMPs, enabling their utility in different applications, including some in the biomedical field. Reports on SMP foams have focused on those based on organic polymer systems. In this study, we have prepared inorganic–organic SMP foams comprising inorganic polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) segments and organic poly(ε-caprolactone) PCL segments. The PCL segments served as switching segments to induce shape changing behavior whereas the length of the PDMS soft segment was systematically tuned. SMP foams were formed via the photochemical cure of acrylated (AcO) macromers AcO-PCL₄₀-block-PDMSₘ-block-PCL₄₀-OAc (m = 0, 20, 37, 66 and 130) using a revised solvent casting/particulate leaching (SCPL) method. By varying the PDMS segment length, PDMS-PCL foams having excellent shape memory behavior were obtained that exhibited highly tunable properties, including pore size, % porosity, compressive modulus, and degradation rate.  aPublisher supplied data 3aporosity 3aphotochemistry 3aheat 3aleaching 3asolvents 3afoams 3apolydimethylsiloxane 0apoly(ε-caprolactone) 0aporous materials 0ashape memory polymers 0areports1 aPetersen, Keri M.1 aGrunlan, Melissa A.0 tACS Applied Materials & Interfaces.g2013 Jan. 09, v. 5, no. 1 p.186-191dAmerican Chemical Societyx1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fam302426e3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02586naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245018800166300001300354520117500367592002801542650003901570650001901609650002001628650003801648650001801686650001701704653003701721653004501758653004301803653004501846700002001891700001801911700001901929700001501948700001801963700001201981773009201993856008202085852000902167655001202176IND60091653020221122010630.0161021e20130515xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009165302DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bios.2012.11.0222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Yiping,13aAn immunosensor based on magnetic relaxation switch and polystyrene microparticle-induced immune multivalency enrichment system for the detection of Pantoea stewartii subsp.

This immunosensor combines magnetic relaxation switch (MRS) assay with polystyrene microparticle-induced immune multivalency enrichment system. Comparing to conventional enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), the immunosensor developed in this study provides higher sensitivity and requires less analysis time. The detection limit of Pss obtained by immunosensor was determined to be 103cfu/mL, 50 times lower than that by ELISA (5×104cfu/mL), while the analysis time required by immunosensor is 30min much shorter than that by ELISA. The average recoveries studied with Pss at various spiking levels ranged from 85.5% to 93.4% with a relative standard deviation (RSD) below 6.0%. No cross-reaction with the other five strains was found, demonstrating a good specificity of Pss detection. The results showed that the MRS immunosensor combined with PS-induced immune multivalency enhancement system is a promising platform for the determination of large biological molecules due to its high sensitivity, specificity, homogeneity, and speed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPantoea stewartii subsp. stewartii 3across reaction 3adetection limit 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3aimmunosensors 3apolystyrenes 0aMagnetic relaxation switch (MRS) 0aMagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (MION) 0aImmune multivalency enhancement system 0aPantoea stewartii subsp.

Shell adsorption, in which adsorbates do not completely penetrate the adsorbent but instead preferentially adsorb near the outer surface of the adsorbent, may explain this enhancement in equilibrium adsorption capacity. Here, we used isotope microscopy and deuterium-doped MIB and geosmin to directly visualize the solid-phase adsorbate concentration profiles of MIB and geosmin in carbon particles. The deuterium/hydrogen ratio, which we used as an index of the solid-phase concentration of MIB and geosmin, was higher in the shell region than in the inner region of carbon particles. Solid-phase concentrations of MIB and geosmin obtained from the deuterium/hydrogen ratio roughly agreed with those predicted by shell adsorption model analyses of isotherm data. The direct visualization of the localization of micropollutant adsorbates in activated carbon particles provided direct evidence of shell adsorption.  aPublisher supplied data 3a2-methylisoborneol 3aactivated carbon 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3adeuterium 3ageosmin 3aisotopes 3amicroscopy 3amodels 3aorganic matter 3aparticle size 3apollutants1 aSakamoto, Asuka1 aNakao, Soichi1 aTaniguchi, Takuma1 aMatsushita, T.q(Taku),1 aShirasaki, Nobutaka1 aSakamoto, Naoya1 aYurimoto, Hisayoshi0 tEnvironmental Science & Technology.g2014 Sept. 16, v. 48, no. 18 p.10897-10903dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fes50245153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02594naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245008900169300001400258520160300272592002801875650001401903650000801917650001201925650001901937650002401956650001301980650001501993650001202008700002102020700002002041773010502061856008102166852000902247655001202256IND60555584220221120173950.0161029e201610  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055558422DNAL7 a10.1007/s10546-016-0155-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aArduini, Gabriele10aInteractions Between the Nighttime Valley-Wind System and a Developing Cold-Air Pool  ap. 49-72.  aThe Weather Research and Forecast numerical model is used to characterize the influence of a thermally-driven down-valley flow on a developing cold-air pool in an idealized alpine valley decoupled from the atmosphere above. Results for a three-dimensional (3D) valley, which allows for the formation of a down-valley flow, and for a two-dimensional (2D) valley, where the formation of a down-valley flow is inhibited, are analyzed and compared. A key result is that advection leads to a net cooling in the 2D valley and to a warming in the 3D valley, once the down-valley flow is fully developed. This difference stems from the suppression of the slope-flow induced upward motions over the valley centre in the 3D valley. As a result, the downslope flows develop a cross-valley circulation within the cold-air pool, the growth of the cold-air pool is reduced and the valley atmosphere is generally warmer than in the 2D valley. A quasi-steady state is reached for which the divergence of the down-valley flow along the valley is balanced by the convergence of the downslope flows at the top of the cold-air pool, with no net contribution of subsiding motions far from the slope layer. More precisely, the inflow of air at the top of the cold-air pool is found to be driven by an interplay between the return flow from the plain region and subsidence over the plateaux. Finally, the mechanisms that control the structure of the cold-air pool and its evolution are found to be independent of the valley length as soon as the quasi-steady state is reached and the down-valley flow is fully developed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadvection 3aair 3acooling 3adrainage water 3amathematical models 3aplateaus 3asubsidence 3aweather1 aStaquet, Chantal1 aChemel, Charles0 tBoundary-layer meteorology.g2016 Oct., v. 161, no. 1 p.49-72dSpringer Netherlandsx0006-83147nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10546-016-0155-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02411naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001800139245012300157300001800280520113700298592002801435650002501463650000901488650001901497650001701516650001501533650001801548650001301566650001901579650003301598650002001631650001501651653002001666653001701686653002701703653001901730700001601749700001601765773012401781856007501905852000901980655001201989IND60527456120221122065512.0160715e20130626xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052745612DNAL7 a10.1021/am40094882doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDing, Qianwei10aMorphology and Photocatalytic Property of Hierarchical Polyimide/ZnO Fibers Prepared via a Direct Ion-exchange Process  ap. 5617-5622.  aA simple and efficient method has been developed for preparing hierarchical nanostructures of polyimide (PI)/ZnO fibers by combining electrospinning and direct ion-exchange process. Poly(amic acid) (PAA) nanofibers are first prepared by electrospinning, and then, the electrospun PAA fibers are immersed into ZnCl₂ solution. After a subsequent thermal treatment, imidization of PAA and formation of ZnO nanoparticles can be simultaneously achieved in one step to obtain PI/ZnO composite fibers. SEM images show that ZnO nanoparticles are densely and uniformly immobilized on the surface of electrospun PI fibers. Furthermore, the morphology of ZnO can be tuned from nanoplatelets to nanorods by changing the initial concentration of ZnCl₂ solution. Photocatalytic degradation tests show an efficient degradation ability of PI/ZnO composite membranes toward organic dyes. Meanwhile, the free-standing membrane is highly flexible, easy to handle, and easy to retrieve, which enables its use in water treatment. This simple and inexpensive approach can also be applied to fabricating other hierarchically nanostructured composites.  aPublisher supplied data 3aasymmetric membranes 3adyes 3aheat treatment 3aion exchange 3ananofibers 3ananoparticles 3ananorods 3aphotocatalysis 3ascanning electron microscopy 3awater treatment 3azinc oxide 0aelectrospinning 0aion-exchange 0ahierarchical structure 0aphotocatalysis1 aMiao, Yue-E1 aLiu, Tianxi0 tACS Applied Materials & Interfaces.g2013 June 26, v. 5, no. 12 p.5617-5622dAmerican Chemical Societyx1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fam40094883Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02136naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100003100146245011000177300001600287520079500303592002801098650001101126650001101137650001101148650001201159650002001171650001501191650002401206650001901230650001101249650001201260650001001272653003101282653002101313653001101334653002401345653001501369653002101384700002001405700001801425700002701443773011901470856008001589852000901669655001201678IND60616763220221118231105.0181020e200902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061676322DNAL7 a10.1177/00405175080940912doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMurrells, Charlotte Marion13aAn Artificial Neural Network Model for the Prediction of Spirality of Fully Relaxed Single Jersey Fabrics  ap. 227-234.  aThe present paper proposes an artificial neural network model for the prediction of the degree of spirality of single jersey fabrics made from 100 % cotton conventional and modified ring spun yarns. The factors investigated were the yarn residual torque as the measured twist liveliness, yarn type, yarn linear density, fabric tightness factor, the number of feeders, rotational direction and gauge of the knitting machine and dyeing method. The artificial neural network model was compared with a multiple regression model, demonstrating that the neural network model produced superior results to predict the degree of fabric spirality after three washing and drying cycles. The relative importance of the investigated factors influencing the spirality of the fabric was also investigated.  aPublisher supplied data 3aJersey 3acotton 3adrying 3afabrics 3aneural networks 3aprediction 3aregression analysis 3atextile fibers 3atorque 3awashing 3ayarns 0aartificial neural networks 0afabric spirality 0amodels 0amultiple regression 0aprediction 0atwist liveliness1 aXiao Ming Tao, 1 aBin Gang Xu, 1 aCheng, Kwok Po Stephen0 tTextile research journal.g2009 Feb., v. 79, no. 3 p.227-234dSAGE PublicationswJournal:jnl46536x0040-51757nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/00405175080940913Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01325naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100001500138245011800153300001600271520028600287592002800573650001500601650002300616650002300639650002900662650002400691650002200715650002000737650001700757700001800774773012600792856007200918852000900990655001200999IND60658067620221121214145.0190816e20070115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065806762DNAL7 a10.1039/b616007g2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJiang, Hui10aEnzyme–quantum dots architecture for highly sensitive electrochemiluminescence biosensing of oxidase substrates  ap. 404-406.  aA simple strategy for the fabrication of the first biosensor based on the intrinsic electrochemiluminescence of quantum dots coupled with an enzymatic reaction is proposed with glucose oxidase as a model, which could be applied in more bioanalytical systems for oxidase substrates.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiosensors 3achemical compounds 3achemical reactions 3aelectrochemiluminescence 3aenzymatic reactions 3aenzyme substrates 3aglucose oxidase 3aquantum dots1 aJu, Huangxian0 tChemical communications.g2007 Jan. 15, , no. 4 p.404-406dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26910x1364-548X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/b616007g3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02550naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001700149245013600166520122700302592002801529650002001557650001601577650002701593650002601620650001701646650001901663650002901682650002301711651001601734653002201750653002301772653002201795653001601817653002101833653002301854653000801877653000801885653000801893653000801901653000801909773009401917856008402011852000902095655001202104IND60674187920221116191559.0200221e202001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067418792DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enpol.2019.1110572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNdebele, Tom10aAssessing the potential for consumer-driven renewable energy development in deregulated electricity markets dominated by renewables  aRenewable energy development in deregulated electricity markets dominated by fossil fuels has benefited from various government incentives and green marketing. Electricity generation in New Zealand is dominated by renewables and has developed with no government incentives or green marketing since the reforms in 1986. The New Zealand government has set a renewable energy target of 90% by 2025 with no direct support. The objective of this paper is to assess the potential for consumer-driven renewable energy development required to achieve this target by estimating willingness to pay for green electricity in the context of supplier choice. The study is based on a stated choice dataset generated using a choice experiment administered to an online panel of domestic electricity consumers in 2014. Results from a random parameter logit model estimated on 2688 choice responses show that, on average, consumers are willing to pay an extra $3.20 per month or 2% of their current power bills for a 10 percentage point increase in the share of electricity from renewable sources. These findings demonstrate that consumers are willing to support the development of renewables even where a market is dominated by renewables.  aPublisher supplied data 3adata collection 3aelectricity 3aelectricity generation 3aenvironmental markets 3afossil fuels 3alogit analysis 3arenewable energy sources 3awillingness to pay 3aNew Zealand 0aChoice experiment 0aWillingness to pay 0aGreen electricity 0aMixed logit 0aRenewable energy 0aConsumer switching 0aC93 0aD01 0aD12 0aL94 0aQ480 tEnergy policy.g2020 Jan., v. 136 p.111057-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12439x0301-42157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enpol.2019.1110573Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02230naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001900152245006600171300001800237520126700255592002801522650001801550650001001568650001101578650001101589650001501600650001301615650002401628650001001652651001101662700002401673773010001697856008601797852000901883655001201892IND60086316620221120025505.0141101e20110915xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008631662DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecolecon.2011.06.0242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSælen, Håkon12aA choice experiment on fuel taxation and earmarking in Norway  ap. 2181-2190.  aPigouvian taxes are efficient — but unpopular among voters — and hence often politically infeasible. Earmarking of revenues has been widely reported to increase public support for taxes, but earmarking is generally not the most efficient use of the revenues. This trade-off between efficiency and political feasibility is the motivation for our primary research objective: to quantify the effect of earmarking on support for fuel tax rises. Our secondary research objective is to investigate why earmarking increases support. Using data from a representative sample of the Norwegian voter population (N=1147), we estimate models of voter preferences for fuel taxes using logistic regression models. Our results show that, in the absence of earmarking, the majority of voters would like to reduce fuel taxes, but earmarking the revenues for environmental measures has a substantial effect on voter support for fuel tax increases, garnering a majority for increases of up to 15% above present levels. Further analysis indicates that a prime reason why earmarking for environmental measures is popular is that it increases the perceived environmental effectiveness of the tax, and hence its legitimacy as an environmental rather than a fiscal policy instrument.  aPublisher supplied data 3afiscal policy 3afuels 3aincome 3amodels 3amotivation 3apolitics 3aregression analysis 3ataxes 3aNorway1 aKallbekken, Steffen0 tEcological economics.g2011 Sept. 15, v. 70, no. 11 p.2181-2190dElsevier B.V.x0921-80097nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolecon.2011.06.0243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02896naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004900094040001800143100001900161245009800180300001800278500000900296520139700305592002801702650001601730650001501746650001301761650002301774650001201797650002101809650002401830650002101854650002601875650001301901650001501914650002701929650002401956650002101980650001102001650002902012650001802041650001302059650002202072651001402094700001802108700002002126773015102146856009602297852000902393655001202402IND60668443720221119122354.0191125e198809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066844372DNAL7 a10.2136/sssaj1988.03615995005200050038x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRussell, J.

Samples of six soils from eastern Australia were collected to determine their P sorption characteristics. Monocalcium phosphate solutions containing 0.005 M CaCl₂ were equilibrated with samples which were untreated, limed or CaCl₂-leached. Measurements were made of the amount of P sorbed and P remaining in solution. The soil chemical properties affecting P sorption, P buffering and amount of P sorbed needed to provide 0.2 µg P mL⁻¹ were determined by multiple regression analysis. Phosphorus sorption and buffer capacity increased with increasing CuCl₂-extractable Al and decreased with increasing exchangeable Na saturation or increased soil solution Na. Amounts of sorbed P needed for 0.2 µg P mL⁻¹ in the soil solution were relatively small for the untreated and limed Natrustalfs and ranged from 13 to 37 mg P kg⁻¹ soil. A given application of P fertilizer will provide a higher soil solution P in subtropical soils which contain appreciable Na, such as Natrustalfs, than those in which Ca is the dominant cation.

There is a growing realization that such forms of inheritance can play an important role in evolution. Bacteria represent a prime example of epigenetic inheritance because a large array of cellular components is transmitted to offspring, in addition to genetic material. Interestingly, there is an extensive and growing empirical literature showing that many bacteria can form ‘persister’ cells that are phenotypically resistant or tolerant to antibiotics, but most of these results are not interpreted within the context of epigenetic inheritance. Instead, persister cells are usually viewed as a genetically encoded bet‐hedging strategy that has evolved in response to a fluctuating environment. Here I show, using a relatively simple model, that many of these empirical findings can be more simply understood as arising from a combination of epigenetic inheritance and cellular noise. I therefore suggest that phenotypic drug tolerance in bacteria might represent one of the best‐studied examples of evolution under epigenetic inheritance.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aRNA 3aantibiotic resistance 3aantibiotics 3abacteria 3aepigenetics 3aevolution 3agene expression 3amodels 3aparents 3aphenotype 3aprogeny0 tMolecular ecology.g2016 Apr., v. 25, no. 8 p.1869-1882dBlackwell Scientific Publicationsx0962-10837nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/mec.136033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02438naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100001900138245008800157300001800245500002000263520135800283592002801641650002901669650002301698650002001721650001401741650002301755650001201778650001701790700002401807700002001831700002601851773013001877856007202007852000902079655001202088IND60648201520221120172759.0190627e20150513xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064820152DNAL7 a10.3390/f60516962doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSegura, Marina12aA New Collaborative Methodology for Assessment and Management of Ecosystem Services  ap. 1696-1720.  aJournal Article  aCollaborative management is a new framework to help implement programmes in protected areas. Within this context, the aim of this work is twofold. First, to propose a robust methodology to implement collaborative management focused on ecosystem services. Second, to develop indicators for the main functions of ecosystem services. Decision makers, technical staff and other stakeholders are included in the process from the beginning, by identifying ecosystem services and eliciting preferences using the AHP method. Qualitative and quantitative data are then integrated into a PROMETHEE based method in order to obtain indicators for provisioning, maintenance and direct to citizens services. This methodology, which has been applied in a forest area, provides a tool for exploiting available technical and social data in a continuous process, as well as providing easy to understand graphical results. This approach also overcomes the difficulties found in prioritizing management objectives in a multiple criteria context with limited resources and facilitates consensus between all of the people involved. The new indicators define an innovative approach to assessing the ecosystem services from the supply perspective and provide basic information to help establish payment systems for environmental services and compensation for natural disasters.  aPublisher supplied data 3acollaborative management 3aconservation areas 3adecision making 3adisasters 3aecosystem services 3aforests 3astakeholders1 aMaroto, Concepción1 aBelton, Valerie1 aGinestar, Concepción0 tForests.g2015 May 13, v. 6, no. 5 p.1696-1720dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2257x1999-49077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/f60516963Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02985naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100004400149245017600193300001600369520156300385592002801948650001501976650001301991650001302004650001102017650001402028650001802042650001102060650001402071650002002085650001602105650001202121650001302133650001102146650001802157651001402175653002802189653002002217653001302237653001402250653001302264700002502277773012102302856008302423852000902506655001202515IND60557969720221120171722.0200612e20161001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055796972DNAL7 a10.1515/macvetrev-2016-00872doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLengkey, Hendronoto Arnoldus Walewangko10aPhysico-chemical and Microbiological Characteristics, Sensory Quality and Acceptability of Native Chicken and Rabbit Sausage Produced with Corn Oil, Margarine and Beef Fat  ap. 193-199.  aIn this paper, we evaluated the effect of certain oils or fats (corn oil, margarine and beef fat) on the physico-chemical, microbiological characteristics and sensory quality of native chicken and rabbit sausages as low fat sausages. The sausages were evaluated by physicochemical analysis of pH, aw, moisture content, protein and fat, TPC and Salmonella as microbiological characteristics, as well as flavor, juiciness and overall acceptability as sensory quality, and with regards to diversification of meat products in Indonesia. Three formulations for native chicken (FA) and rabbit (FB) sausages were prepared: FA1 and FB1 (with 10% corn oil); FA2 and FB2 (with 10% margarine): FA3 and FB3 (with 10% beef fat). Results indicated no significant difference (p<0.05) between the pH and aw values of native chicken and rabbit sausages using different fat sources. The moisture content was significantly different (p<0.05) both between the native chicken and rabbit sausages and the types of fat source (corn oil, margarine and beef fat) added. No effect on protein content was found both in native chicken and rabbit sausages. The lowest fat content was found in rabbit sausages (18.79 + 0.70%) where corn oil was added as a fat source. Lowest TPC was also observed. Salmonella were not detected in any of the sausage groups. There was no significant difference (p<0.05) in various sensory attributes. In conclusion, native chicken and rabbit meat seems to be a suitable alternative for low fat sausages production, particularly with corn oil as fat source.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSalmonella 3achickens 3acorn oil 3aflavor 3ajuiciness 3alipid content 3alipids 3amargarine 3aprotein content 3arabbit meat 3arabbits 3asausages 3atallow 3awater content 3aIndonesia 0anative chicken sausages 0arabbit sausages 0acorn oil 0amargarine 0abeef fat1 aLobo, Balia Roostita0 tMacedonian veterinary review.g2016 Oct. 01, v. 39, no. 2 p.193-199dDe Gruyter OpenwJournal:21442x1409-76217nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1515/macvetrev-2016-00873Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03797naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100005100144245008300195500002000278520189000298592002802188596008402216596009202300596012102392650004402513650002202557650001602579650002402595650001302619650003802632650003102670650001802701650001802719650002102737650001902758650001902777650001102796650001802807650002802825650002202853650002102875650002502896650001902921700001502940700001602955700001202971700001702983700001503000773015303015856007803168852000903246655001203255IND60687784820221122070528.0200404e202004  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068778482DNAL7 a10.1002/ejlt.2019003252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPan, Li1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3582-336010aWhey Protein Isolate Coated Liposomes as Novel Carrier Systems for Astaxanthin  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aIn this work, whey protein isolate (WPI)‐coated astaxanthin‐loaded liposomes are prepared by combining the fabrication of liposomes with the layer self‐assembly deposition technique. The physical properties of such composite carriers are evaluated by zeta potential, particle size, distribution, encapsulation efficiency, and morphology. WPI‐ coated astaxanthin‐loaded liposomes display homodisperse distribution and high encapsulation efficiency with a WPI coating layer surrounding the surface of conventional liposomes by the electrostatic interaction. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and X‐ray diffraction analysis reveal that WPI interacts with the lipid bilayer via hydrophobic forces and hydrogen bonding, which result in the successful coating. Based on experimental results of differential scanning calorimetry and thermogravimetric analysis, it is demonstrated that thermal stability of astaxanthin‐loaded liposomes benefits from the formation of surface modification of the WPI‐layer. In addition, the physical stability of WPI‐coated astaxanthin‐loaded liposomes under heating and light is significantly improved as compared with uncoated liposomes. This research might provide scientific guidance for the development of WPI‐coated liposomes as efficient carrier systems for bioactive substances in food and pharmaceutical industry. Practical Applications: To improve lipid membrane stability and to prevent the leakage of encapsulated astaxanthin, a novel carrier system based on WPI coated on the surface of liposomes is prepared through the layer self‐assembly deposition technique. This research suggests that WPI‐coated liposomes represent an effective and stable delivery system for astaxanthin. WPI‐coated liposomes could be developed as efficient carrier systems for bioactive compounds in the food and pharmaceutical industries.  aPublisher supplied data  a2018BS049cHigh‐level Talents Fund of Henan University of Technology in China  a2017XTCX02cScientific Research Fund Project of Henan University of Technology in China  aPL2018005cProject of Key Laboratory of Transformation and Utilization of Cereal Resource of Henan Province of China 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3aastaxanthin 3abioactive compounds 3acoatings 3adifferential scanning calorimetry 3aelectrostatic interactions 3aencapsulation 3afood industry 3ahydrogen bonding 3ahydrophobicity 3alipid bilayers 3alipids 3aparticle size 3apharmaceutical industry 3athermal stability 3athermogravimetry 3awhey protein isolate 3azeta potential1 aZhang, Xin1 aFan, Xiaozu1 aLi, Hua1 aXu, Baocheng1 aLi, Xueqin0 tEuropean journal of lipid science and technology.g2020 Apr., v. 122, no. 4 p.e1900325-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3921629x1438-76977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ejlt.2019003253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02974naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001900142245013300161520148400294592002801778650001701806650002301823650002501846650001501871650001501886650001801901650002401919650002001943650002001963650001401983650002401997653001602021653002102037653002102058653001502079653001802094700001802112700002202130700001902152700002102171700002502192700002402217700002302241700001802264773011302282856007602395852000902471655001202480IND60742134820221119212548.0210623e20210615xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074213482DNAL7 a10.3897/BDJ.9.e653712doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGroom, Quentin10aHolistic understanding of contemporary ecosystems requires integration of data on domesticated, captive and cultivated organisms  aDomestic and captive animals and cultivated plants should be recognised as integral components in contemporary ecosystems. They interact with wild organisms through such mechanisms as hybridization, predation, herbivory, competition and disease transmission and, in many cases, define ecosystem properties. Nevertheless, it is widespread practice for data on domestic, captive and cultivated organisms to be excluded from biodiversity repositories, such as natural history collections. Furthermore, there is a lack of integration of data collected about biodiversity in disciplines, such as agriculture, veterinary science, epidemiology and invasion science. Discipline-specific data are often intentionally excluded from integrative databases in order to maintain the “purity” of data on natural processes. Rather than being beneficial, we argue that this practise of data exclusivity greatly limits the utility of discipline-specific data for applications ranging from agricultural pest management to invasion biology, infectious disease prevention and community ecology. This problem can be resolved by data providers using standards to indicate whether the observed organism is of wild or domestic origin and by integrating their data with other biodiversity data (e.g. in the Global Biodiversity Information Facility). Doing so will enable efforts to integrate the full panorama of biodiversity knowledge across related disciplines to tackle pressing societal questions.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiodiversity 3adisease prevention 3adisease transmission 3aecosystems 3aherbivores 3ahybridization 3ainfectious diseases 3anatural history 3apest management 3apredation 3aveterinary medicine 0aDarwin core 0ainteroperability 0ainvasive species 0aOne Health 0aurban ecology1 aAdriaens, Tim1 aBertolino, Sandro1 aPhelps, Kendra1 aPoelen, Jorrit H1 aReeder, DeeAnn Marie1 aRichardson, David M1 aSimmons, Nancy B.,1 aUpham, Nathan0 tBiodiversity data journal.g2021 June 15, v. 9 p.e65371-dPensoft PublisherswJournal:21364x1314-28287nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3897/BDJ.9.e653713Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03840naa a2200709 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245008700170300001800257520171400275592002801989650002802017650001702045650002702062650002202089650002702111650002302138650001002161650002002171650001502191650001702206650003002223650002702253650002002280650001502300650000902315650003502324650004802359650001002407700001802417700002302435700001702458700001802475700002302493700001902516700002702535700002202562700002202584700001802606700001702624700001802641700001702659700002002676700002302696700002302719700002102742700002002763700002102783700002202804700002102826700001702847700002002864700002302884773012102907856008103028852000903109655001203118IND60537262220221122231001.0160807e201608  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053726222DNAL7 a10.1007/s00122-016-2720-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKassa, Mulualem T.12aA saturated SNP linkage map for the orange wheat blossom midge resistance gene Sm1  ap. 1507-1517.  aKEY MESSAGE : SNP markers were developed for the OWBM resistance gene Sm1 that will be useful for MAS. The wheat Sm1 region is collinear with an inverted syntenic interval in B. distachyon. Orange wheat blossom midge (OWBM, Sitodiplosis mosellana Géhin) is an important insect pest of wheat (Triticum aestivum) in many growing regions. Sm1 is the only described OWBM resistance gene and is the foundation of managing OWBM through host genetics. Sm1 was previously mapped to wheat chromosome arm 2BS relative to simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers and the dominant, sequence characterized amplified region (SCAR) marker WM1. The objectives of this research were to saturate the Sm1 region with markers, develop improved markers for marker-assisted selection (MAS), and examine the synteny between wheat, Brachypodium distachyon, and rice (Oryza sativa) in the Sm1 region. The present study mapped Sm1 in four populations relative to single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), SSRs, Diversity Array Technology (DArT) markers, single strand conformation polymorphisms (SSCPs), and the SCAR WM1. Numerous high quality SNP assays were designed that mapped near Sm1. BLAST delineated the syntenic intervals in B. distachyon and rice using gene-based SNPs as query sequences. The Sm1 region in wheat was inverted relative to B. distachyon and rice, which suggests a chromosomal rearrangement within the Triticeae lineage. Seven SNPs were tested on a collection of wheat lines known to carry Sm1 and not to carry Sm1. Sm1-flanking SNPs were identified that were useful for predicting the presence or absence of Sm1 based upon haplotype. These SNPs will be a major improvement for MAS of Sm1 in wheat breeding programs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBrachypodium distachyon 3aOryza sativa 3aSitodiplosis mosellana 3aTriticum aestivum 3achromosome aberrations 3achromosome mapping 3agenes 3agenetic markers 3ahaplotypes 3ainsect pests 3amarker-assisted selection 3amicrosatellite repeats 3apest resistance 3aprediction 3arice 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 3asingle-stranded conformational polymorphism 3awheat1 aHaas, Sabrina1 aSchliephake, Edgar1 aLewis, Clare1 aYou, Frank M.1 aPozniak, Curtis J.1 aKrämer, Ilona1 aPerović, Dragan-Bobi,1 aSharpe, Andrew G.1 aFobert, Pierre R.1 aKoch, Michael1 aWise, Ian L.1 aFenwick, Paul1 aBerry, Simon1 aSimmonds, James1 aHourcade, Delphine1 aSenellart, Patrice1 aDuchalais, Laure1 aRobert, Olivier1 aFörster, Jutta,1 aThomas, Julian B.1 aFriedt, Wolfgang1 aOrdon, Frank1 aUauy, Cristobal1 aMcCartney, Curt A.0 tTheoretical and applied genetics.g2016 Aug., v. 129, no. 8 p.1507-1517dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx0040-57527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00122-016-2720-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03049naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001400148245017000162300001600332520163300348592002801981650000802009650002302017650001502040650002002055650001702075650001002092650001102102650001202113650001902125650001402144650002002158653002502178653005002203653003302253653002602286700001902312700001602331700005302347700001502400773009702415856008202512852000902594655001202603IND60553382120221122005539.0161021e20140915xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055338212DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bios.2014.03.0512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhu, Jing10aToehold-mediated strand displacement reaction triggered isothermal DNA amplification for highly sensitive and selective fluorescent detection of single-base mutation  ap. 276-281.  aHighly sensitive and selective detection strategy for single-base mutations is essential for risk assessment of malignancy and disease prognosis. In this work, a fluorescent detection method for single-base mutation was proposed based on high selectivity of toehold-mediated strand displacement reaction (TSDR) and powerful signal amplification capability of isothermal DNA amplification. A discrimination probe was specially designed with a stem-loop structure and an overhanging toehold domain. Hybridization between the toehold domain and the perfect matched target initiated the TSDR along with the unfolding of the discrimination probe. Subsequently, the target sequence acted as a primer to initiate the polymerization and nicking reactions, which released a great abundant of short sequences. Finally, the released strands were annealed with the reporter probe, launching another polymerization and nicking reaction to produce lots of G-quadruplex DNA, which could bind the N-methyl mesoporphyrin IX to yield an enhanced fluorescence response. However, when there was even a single base mismatch in the target DNA, the TSDR was suppressed and so subsequent isothermal DNA amplification and fluorescence response process could not occur. The proposed approach has been successfully implemented for the identification of the single-base mutant sequences in the human KRAS gene with a detection limit of 1.8pM. Furthermore, a recovery of 90% was obtained when detecting the target sequence in spiked HeLa cells lysate, demonstrating the feasibility of this detection strategy for single-base mutations in biological samples.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3abase pair mismatch 3abiosensors 3adetection limit 3afluorescence 3agenes 3ahumans 3amutants 3apolymerization 3aprognosis 3arisk assessment 0aSingle-base mutation 0aToehold-mediated strand displacement reaction 0aIsothermal DNA amplification 0aFluorescent detection1 aDing, Yongshun1 aLiu, Xingti1 aWang, Lei1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3066-61051 aJiang, Wei0 tBiosensors & bioelectronics.g2014 Sept. 15, v. 59 p.276-281dElsevier B.V.x0956-56637nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bios.2014.03.0513Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02726naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100001700138245011500155300001800270500002000288520141500308592002801723650001501751650002301766650002001789650002101809650001001830650001001840651001601850700002001866700001801886700003001904700002601934700002201960700001701982700002201999700002102021700001802042700002102060773013002081856007202211852000902283655001202292IND60648201620221120142231.0190627e20150515xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064820162DNAL7 a10.3390/f60517212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEysn, Lothar12aA Benchmark of Lidar-Based Single Tree Detection Methods Using Heterogeneous Forest Data from the Alpine Space  ap. 1721-1747.  aJournal Article  aIn this study, eight airborne laser scanning (ALS)-based single tree detection methods are benchmarked and investigated. The methods were applied to a unique dataset originating from different regions of the Alpine Space covering different study areas, forest types, and structures. This is the first benchmark ever performed for different forests within the Alps. The evaluation of the detection results was carried out in a reproducible way by automatically matching them to precise in situ forest inventory data using a restricted nearest neighbor detection approach. Quantitative statistical parameters such as percentages of correctly matched trees and omission and commission errors are presented. The proposed automated matching procedure presented herein shows an overall accuracy of 97%. Method based analysis, investigations per forest type, and an overall benchmark performance are presented. The best matching rate was obtained for single-layered coniferous forests. Dominated trees were challenging for all methods. The overall performance shows a matching rate of 47%, which is comparable to results of other benchmarks performed in the past. The study provides new insight regarding the potential and limits of tree detection with ALS and underlines some key aspects regarding the choice of method when performing single tree detection for the various forest types encountered in alpine regions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aautomation 3aconiferous forests 3adata collection 3aforest inventory 3alidar 3atrees 3aAlps region1 aHollaus, Markus1 aLindberg, Eva1 aBerger, F.q(Frédéric),1 aMonnet, Jean-Matthieu1 aDalponte, Michele1 aKobal, Milan1 aPellegrini, Marco1 aLingua, Emanuele1 aMongus, Domen1 aPfeifer, Norbert0 tForests.g2015 May 15, v. 6, no. 5 p.1721-1747dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2257x1999-49077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/f60517213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03157naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001900149245013400168300001600302520154400318592002801862650001901890650001101909650001401920650001501934650000901949650001901958650002501977650001702002650002302019650001802042650000902060650003102069650000902100650002502109650001602134650001602150650001202166653000802178653001102186653001002197653002102207700003102228700002102259700002002280700002402300700002402324700002002348700002202368773012102390856008302511852000902594655001202603IND60557969820221120181553.0200612e20161001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055796982DNAL7 a10.1515/macvetrev-2016-00882doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCannas, Simona10aStress and Cancer in Dogs: Comparison Between a Population of Dogs Diagnosed with Cancer and a Control Population - A Pilot Study  ap. 201-208.  aIt is widely accepted that psychological stress and mental illness can compromise the function of the immune system. Clinical and epidemiological studies on humans recognized that specific psychosocial factors, such as stress, chronic depression and lack of social support are risk factors for the development and progression of cancer. Unfortunately, most of the animals studies on this subject are based on laboratory tests performed on mice. This retrospective cohort study aims to analyze the relation between stress and tumor in pet dogs, by evaluating and comparing the stress level in two groups of 69 dogs each, balanced for sex and age: the oncologic group consists of dogs diagnosed with cancer and the control group consists of healthy dogs. Our results show that, before the cancer diagnosis, more dogs in the oncologic group faced changes in their household and routine as opposed to the control group (p<0.05). More dogs of the oncologic group than the control group also showed signs of stress and anxiety, before the cancer diagnosis (p<0.05). As reported by their owners, these included attention seeking, hiding without a specific reason, following the owner around the house, hyper-vigilance, fear of fireworks and gunshots, biting, aggression towards other dogs, licking and chewing excessively parts of their body. Our results are aligned with the evidence from human research, indicating that dogs with cancer are significantly more likely to have shown signs of stress compared to the control dogs during their life.  aPublisher supplied data 3asocial support 3ahumans 3aneoplasms 3aaggression 3adogs 3acohort studies 3apsychological stress 3arisk factors 3abehavior disorders 3aimmune system 3amice 3alaboratory experimentation 3apets 3apsychosocial factors 3afearfulness 3amastication 3aanxiety 0adog 0astress 0atumor 0aproblem behavior1 aBerteselli, Greta Veronica1 aPiotti, Patrizia1 aTalamonti, Zita1 aScaglia, Elisabetta1 aStefanello, Damiano1 aMinero, Michela1 aPalestrini, Clara0 tMacedonian veterinary review.g2016 Oct. 01, v. 39, no. 2 p.201-208dDe Gruyter OpenwJournal:21442x1409-76217nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1515/macvetrev-2016-00883Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02438naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002700149245008000176520133300256592002801589650001601617650001101633650001201644650001101656650001601667650002901683651001201712653002601724653003101750653001501781653001801796653002101814700002301835700001901858773009401877856008401971852000902055655001202064IND60674188120221116191449.0200221e202001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067418812DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enpol.2019.1110612doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLang, Lukas Maximilian14aThe meaning of flow-based market coupling on redispatch measures in Austria  aEnergy market modelling lacks an approach that tackles the implications of flow-based market coupling on congestion management in European electricity markets. Especially in the context of high shares of renewable energy, the topic of network congestion is becoming even more important. Usually, redispatch measures as a main part of congestion management are calculated on the basis of a simple load flow model incorporating net transfer capacities on the day-ahead market. In this paper, we suggest a modelling approach that incorporates the attributes of flow-based market coupling in the calculation of congestion management. An advanced load flow model is therefore already used to reflect the allocation process on the spot market. Retaining this result, necessary congestion management can be calculated on the basis of a more detailed network model representing the control areas’ exact transmission lines. Also, we conduct a comparison between the net transfer capacity- and the flow-based market coupling approach representing different levels of grid-granularities to show the importance of the grid model used for allocation on the European market for electricity. The results suggest, that necessary congestion management in the system is heavily dependent on the grid granularity, both in the sign and magnitude.  aPublisher supplied data 3aelectricity 3aenergy 3amarkets 3amodels 3apower lines 3arenewable energy sources 3aAustria 0aCongestion management 0aFlow-based market coupling 0aRedispatch 0aZonal pricing 0aNetwork topology1 aDallinger, Bettina1 aLettner, Georg0 tEnergy policy.g2020 Jan., v. 136 p.111061-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12439x0301-42157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enpol.2019.1110613Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03864naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100006300145245006200208300001600270500002000286520242700306592002802733650001902761650002202780650001202802650002702814650001302841650001202854650002502866650002402891650001302915650001502928650002102943650002002964650001302984650001802997650001203015650002203027650002003049650001603069650001603085650001103101650002103112700002203133773012603155856008003281852000903361655001203370IND60589288420221117184405.0180619e201803  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058928842DNAL7 a10.1111/1365-2664.130122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTonietto, Rebecca K.1http://orcid.org/0000-0002-8336-674X10aHabitat restoration benefits wild bees: A meta‐analysis  ap. 582-590.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aPollinator conservation is of increasing interest in the light of managed honeybee (Apis mellifera) declines, and declines in some species of wild bees. Much work has gone into understanding the effects of habitat enhancements in agricultural systems on wild bee abundance, richness and pollination services. However, the effects of ecological restoration targeting “natural” ecological endpoints (e.g. restoring former agricultural fields to historic vegetation types or improving degraded natural lands) on wild bees have received relatively little attention, despite their potential importance for countering habitat loss. We conducted a meta‐analysis to evaluate the effects of ecological restoration on wild bee abundance and richness, focusing on unmanaged bee communities in lands restored and managed to increase habitat availability and quality. Specifically, we assessed bee abundance and/or richness across studies comparing restored vs. unrestored treatments and studies investigating effects of specific habitat restoration techniques, such as burning, grazing, invasive plant removal and seeding. We analysed 28 studies that met our selection criteria: these represented 11 habitat types and 7 restoration techniques. Nearly all restorations associated with these studies were performed without explicit consideration of habitat needs for bees or other pollinators. The majority of restorations targeted plant community goals, which could potentially have ancillary benefits for bees. Restoration had overall positive effects on wild bee abundance and richness across multiple habitat types. Specific restoration actions, tested independently, also tended to have positive effects on wild bee richness and abundance. Synthesis and applications. We found strong evidence that ecological restoration advances wild bee conservation. This is important given that habitat loss is recognized as a leading factor in pollinator decline. Pollinator responses to land management are rarely evaluated in non‐agricultural settings and so support for wild bees may be an underappreciated benefit of botanically focused management. Future restoration projects that explicitly consider the needs of wild bees could be more effective at providing nesting, foraging and other habitat resources. We encourage land managers to design and evaluate restoration projects with the habitat needs of wild bee species in mind.  aPublisher supplied data 3aApis mellifera 3aagricultural land 3aburning 3aecological restoration 3aforaging 3agrazing 3ahabitat conservation 3ahabitat destruction 3ahabitats 3ahoney bees 3ainvasive species 3aland management 3amanagers 3ameta-analysis 3anesting 3aplant communities 3aplants (botany) 3apollination 3apollinators 3asowing 3avegetation types1 aLarkin, Daniel J.0 tJournal of applied ecology.g2018 Mar., v. 55, no. 2 p.582-590dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl57298x0021-89017nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1365-2664.130123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01666naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002600147245010900173300001600282520052100298592002800819650001700847650001600864650002100880650002100901650001300922650001300935653001600948653001900964653001600983653001300999653001601012653001801028653001001046700002401056773014301080856004801223852000901271655001201280IND50076521120221121231912.0140410e20110329xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007652112DNAL7 a10.1080/109429109032569562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChandi, Gurpreet Kaur10aProduction and Characterization of Microbial Carotenoids as an Alternative to Synthetic Colors: a Review  ap. 503-513.  aCarotenoids are important group of pigments with specific applications in food, pharmaceutical, and cosmetic industries owing to their biological properties like antioxidant, anti-carcinogenic, and immune-modulator.

These costs may be alleviated by preserving ecosystem services, such as urban runoff management. We studied the monetary value of this ecosystem service by applying the replacement cost method in six catchments with varying land-use intensities in two cities in Finland. The economic analysis was based on metric data of urban runoff generation, provided by automatic monitoring stations in the catchments. A hydrological model was applied to estimate evaporation from impervious surfaces, and to simulate runoff in the catchments. Our results suggest that leaving green space unconstructed results in significant monetary savings. The cost of managing runoff correlated with land-use intensity. The ecosystem service value (ESV) was generally higher in catchments with high land-use intensity, low proportion of green space, and high costs of runoff management. Depending on the degree of imperviousness, the ESV ranged from 90,000–270,000€ha−1. Further, our results suggest that estimates of runoff generation and evaporation are key hydrological factors for assessing ESV. Our study demonstrates how the combination of field data and hydrological and monetary analyses can support regional planning in cold climates.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase studies 3acities 3aeconomic valuation 3aecosystem services 3aevaporation 3agreen infrastructure 3ahydrologic factors 3ahydrologic models 3aland use 3amonitoring 3aregional planning 3asociety 3aurban runoff 3awatersheds 3aFinland1 aTaka, Maija1 aYli-Pelkonen, Vesa1 aKoivusalo, Harri1 aOllikainen, Markku1 aSetälä, Heikki,0 tEcosystem services.g2017 Dec., v. 28 p.17-27dElsevier B.V.wJournal:21609x2212-04167nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoser.2017.09.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02802naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001700144245017500161300002000336520111900356592002801475650000901503650001201512650001801524650001601542650001001558650001201568650001901580650002801599650001701627650002301644650001601667653001801683653001701701653004801718653001601766653002001782700001801802700001901820700001701839700001701856700001401873700001801887700001301905700005701918700005201975700001602027773014202043856007802185852000902263655001202272IND60707342320221120035350.0200819e20200724xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070734232DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.0c132152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCheng, Haoge10aHighly Efficient Photothermal Conversion of Ti₃C₂Tₓ/Ionic Liquid Gel Pen Ink for Smoothly Writing Ultrasensitive, Wide-Range Detecting, and Flexible Thermal Sensors  ap. 37637-37646.  aPhotothermal conversion behavior has a vital application to disease therapy, water purification, or uncontacted heaters. The fabrication of high-performance photothermal conversion materials especially for near-infrared (NIR) light and microstructures has attracted a great deal of attention. Among numerous substances, MXene as a new type of 2D material with semi-metallic and unique electromagnetic properties presents a broader absorption of light and even a typical plasmonic absorption near the NIR-I area (808 nm), which has made it suitable for photothermal conversion. Here, we propose a facile approach for preparing a Ti₃C₂Tₓ/ionic liquid ink with a high photothermal conversion efficiency. The as-prepared ink has showed good wettability of various substrates as well as the high sensitivity of 808 nm NIR light irradiation and a wide range of thermal variation. After packing the ink into a gel pen refill, the flexible thermal chips could be easily obtained just by pen writing on the soft surface with the designed size, which also have become an optimal candidate for the thermal alarm system.  aPublisher supplied data 3agels 3aheaters 3aionic liquids 3airradiation 3alight 3aliquids 3amicrostructure 3anear infrared radiation 3atherapeutics 3awater purification 3awettability 0aTi3C2Tx MXene 0aionic liquid 0anear-infrared light photothermal conversion 0agel pen ink 0athermal sensors1 aLiu, Qiongxia1 aHan, Shengpeng1 aZhang, Shuai1 aOuyang, Xiao1 aWang, Xun1 aDuan, Zhilong1 aWei, Hao1 aZhang, Xinyue1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8919-16641 aMa, Ning1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3252-54721 aXue, Mianqi0 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2020 July 24, v. 12, no. 33 p.37637-37646dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.0c132153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03240naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005700150245013700207300001600344520142900360592002801789650002001817650002001837650000901857650001001866650001101876650001601887650004801903650000901951650000901960650001401969650001801983650001102001650001402012651001202026653002602038653002002064653001902084653001502103653001902118653001402137700002202151700001702173700001802190700001802208700002302226700002902249700002802278700002202306700006502328700003002393700002502423773010802448856008502556852000902641655001202650IND60611072320221118062044.0200503e201809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061107232DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vetmic.2018.08.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAkkou, Madjid1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1631-924910aNew host shift from human to cows within Staphylococcus aureus involved in bovine mastitis and nasal carriage of animal's caretakers  ap. 173-180.  aStaphylococcus aureus is a commensal and pathogen of both humans and bovines. While the epidemiology of both groups has been extensively studied individually, little is known about the potential zoonotic transfer from animal strains to human being and vice versa. To determine the S. aureus prevalence of bovine mastitis in Algeria and the zoonotic transfer of strains to human beings, mastitis milk samples were collected, and professionals in a close contact with bovines were nasal swabbed. S. aureus isolates were all characterized by methicillin resistance and spa-typing. DNA microarrays analysis was performed on a subset of strains in order to detect other virulence factors, including toxins, and to assign the isolates to theirs MLST clonal complexes. Overall, 116/222 (52.3%) cows suffered from mastitis, whose 38.8% (45/116) infected with S. aureus. Human nasal carriage was of 38% (49/129), with only 4 MRSA carriers (3.1%). A higher diversity of spa-types was observed in human (35/50) than in bovine (18/67) isolates, with a predominance of clonal complexes CC97 and CC22 in bovines. The typical animal clone CC97 was occasionally detected in human beings. Conversely, the CC22 S. aureus clone largely switched from humans to bovines. Our study highlights the potential dynamics of animal and human S. aureus strains in the farm environment in Algeria, which may represent a health threat in both populations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA microarrays 3abovine mastitis 3acows 3afarms 3ahumans 3amethicillin 3amethicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus 3amilk 3anose 3apathogens 3aprofessionals 3atoxins 3avirulence 3aAlgeria 0aStaphylococcus aureus 0aBovine-mastitis 0aHuman carriage 0aspa-Typing 0aDNA microarray 0aHost-jump1 aBouchiat, Coralie1 aAntri, Kenza1 aBes, Michèle1 aTristan, Anne1 aDauwalder, Olivier1 aMartins-Simoes, Patricia1 aRasigade, Jean-Philippe1 aEtienne, Jérôme1 aVandenesch, François1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9412-71061 aRamdani-Bouguessa, Nadjia1 aLaurent, Frédéric,0 tVeterinary microbiology.g2018 Sept., v. 223 p.173-180dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl8205x0378-11357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2018.08.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03354naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002200152245007900174300001600253520199300269592002802262650001502290650001202305650001402317650001302331650001302344650001402357650001702371650001202388650001802400650001502418650001402433650001002447650001202457650002602469653001502495653001502510653001202525653001002537653001402547653001502561700001802576700001302594700001902607700001602626773011002642856008702752852000902839655001202848IND60619710820221122173838.0190408e201903  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061971082DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodqual.2018.10.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 avan Stokkom, V.L.10aCombinations of vegetables can be more accepted than individual vegetables  ap. 147-158.  aEnhancing sweetness of vegetables by addition of sucrose or sweeteners can increase acceptance but is not necessarily desirable. An alternative strategy could be to combine vegetables with other vegetables. By offering combinations of vegetables it might be possible to suppress bitterness, enhance sweetness and provide texture variety leading to increased acceptance. The aim of this study was to determine the influence of combining vegetables with other vegetables on sensory properties and acceptance. Carrot (sweet), cucumber (neutral), green bell pepper (bitter) and red bell pepper (sour) were assessed individually and in combination with the other three vegetables in two mixing ratios (1:2 and 2:1). Additionally, four combinations of three vegetables (mixing ratio 1:1:1) were assessed. A trained panel (n = 24) evaluated taste, flavour and texture and a consumer panel (n = 83) evaluated acceptance of all vegetables and combinations. Combining green bell pepper with carrot (1:2 and 2:1) increased sweetness and decreased bitterness. Combining cucumber, carrot or red bell pepper with green bell pepper (1:2) increased bitterness. Mainly sweetness and bitterness were associated with acceptance whereas texture (crunchiness, firmness and juiciness) did not strongly influence acceptance. Cucumber was the most accepted vegetable followed by carrot, red bell pepper and green bell pepper. Acceptance of vegetable combinations can differ from acceptance of individual vegetables depending on vegetable type and mixing ratio. Only 3 of 16 vegetable combinations had higher acceptance compared to the least accepted vegetable in the combination and similar acceptance as the more accepted vegetable in the combination. For 13 of 16 vegetable combinations acceptance did not increase compared to acceptance of individual vegetables. These findings suggest that strategies aimed at increasing vegetable consumption can be devised using specific combinations of vegetables.  aPublisher supplied data 3abitterness 3acarrots 3acucumbers 3afirmness 3ahardness 3ajuiciness 3amixing ratio 3asucrose 3asweet peppers 3asweeteners 3asweetness 3ataste 3atexture 3avegetable consumption 0aAcceptance 0aVegetables 0aVariety 0aTaste 0aSweetness 0aBitterness1 aGraaf, C. de,1 aWang, S.1 avan Kooten, O.1 aStieger, M.0 tFood quality and preference.g2019 Mar., v. 72 p.147-158dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46499x0950-32937nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodqual.2018.10.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03028naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006100148245011300209300001600322520126300338592002801601650001401629650002201643650002301665650002501688650002201713650002901735650002501764650001701789650002601806650003501832650001101867650002001878650002301898650002601921650000901947650003101956650001801987650003302005650001102038650001802049650001402067700002402081700002502105700002502130700002302155700002702178700002302205700002702228773012802255856008202383852000902465655001202474IND60682497020221121234047.0200128e202002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068249702DNAL7 a10.1007/s00436-019-06569-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSantos, Lívia L.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1416-288X10aMolecular method for the semiquantitative identification of gastrointestinal nematodes in domestic ruminants  ap. 529-543.  aStandard diagnostic methods currently in use for the identification of helminth infections in ruminants are based on the morphological analysis of immature and adult stages of parasites. This paper describes a method for the semiquantitative identification of nematodes, mainly Trichostrongyloidea, at species-level resolution. The method is based on amplification and fragment analysis followed by minisequencing of the ITS-2 region (internal transcribed spacer 2) of the ribosomal DNA of parasite eggs or larvae. This method allows for the identification of seven genera (Chabertia, Cooperia, Haemonchus, Oesophagostomum, Ostertagia, Teladorsagia, and Trichostrongylus) and 12 species (Chabertia ovina, Cooperia curticei, Cooperia punctata, Cooperia oncophora/Cooperia surnabada, Haemonchus contortus, Haemonchus placei, Haemonchus longistipes, Oesophagostomum asperum, Oesophagostomum radiatum, Ostertagia ostertagi, Trichostrongylus axei, and Trichostrongylus colubriformis) of infectious nematodes of domestic ruminants. The concordance between the morphological and molecular analyses in the detection of genera ranged from 0.84 to 0.99, suggesting the proposed detection method is specific, semiquantitative, less laborious, and highly cost-efficient.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChabertia 3aCooperia curticei 3aCooperia oncophora 3aHaemonchus contortus 3aHaemonchus placei 3aOesophagostomum radiatum 3aOstertagia ostertagi 3aTeladorsagia 3aTrichostrongylus axei 3aTrichostrongylus colubriformis 3aadults 3aanimal diseases 3acost effectiveness 3adiagnostic techniques 3aeggs 3agastrointestinal nematodes 3ahelminthiasis 3ainternal transcribed spacers 3alarvae 3aribosomal DNA 3aruminants1 aSalgado, Jordana A.1 aDrummond, Marcela G.1 aBastianetto, Eduardo1 aSantos, Clóvis P.1 aBrasil, Bruno S.

RESULTS: In this study, the self-fertility, progeny performance, and simple sequence repeat (SSR) locus variation of iron walnut (Juglans sigillata Dode), an ecotype of J. regia, were investigated. The average self-pollinated fruit set rate of J. sigillata cv. ‘Dapao’ (DP) was 7.0% annually from 1979 to 1982. The average germination rate of self-pollinated seeds was 45.2% during the 4-year period. Most progeny had inbreeding depression. Nine representative self-pollinated progeny (SP₁–SP₉), with special or typical traits of DP, were selected. SP₁–SP₄ were precocious because they initiated flowers as early as 2 years after germination, compared to the 7–10-yr period that is typical of DP. SP₉ had not flowered since 1980. Twelve SSR markers were used to analyze the SP and DP. The genome of SP had a tendency toward high levels of homozygosity. The high levels of homozygosity reported in 18 additional precocious walnut genotypes complemented the results of this study. CONCLUSIONS: These results provide evidence of precocious phenotypes and genomes with high levels of homozygosity that might be generated from self-pollinating walnut. This suggests that self-pollination might facilitate the generation of unique homozygous parents for subsequent use in walnut-breeding programs. The results also indicate that more attention should be focused on adequate management of precocious walnut to avoid early depression in the production of nuts.  aPublisher supplied data  a31672126cNational Natural Science Foundation of China0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aJuglans regia 3aJuglans sigillata 3aecotypes 3aflowers 3afruit set 3agenome 3agermination 3ahomozygosity 3ainbreeding depression 3aloci 3amicrosatellite repeats 3aparents 3aphenotype 3aprogeny 3aseeds 3aself-pollination 3aselfing 3awalnuts1 aDong, Runquan1 aMa, Qingguo1 aZhang, Yu1 aXu, Shizhong1 aNing, Delu1 aChen, Qin1 aPei, Dong0 tBMC plant biology.g2018 Dec., v. 18, no. 1 p.323-323dBioMed CentralwJournal:2167x1471-22297nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12870-018-1549-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02262naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004000111040001800151100001400169245009800183300001600281520077900297592002801076650001601104650001401120650001201134650001401146650002301160650002701183650002101210650001301231650000901244650002401253650001701277650002401294650002101318650001801339650001301357650001401370650001901384650004201403650002001445650002701465700001901492700001501511700001801526700001801544773008701562856008601649852000901735655001201744IND4466992520221119182436.0141110e201205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446699252DNAL7 a224017122pmid7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2012.02.0332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Lin10aBiodiesel production from algae oil high in free fatty acids by two-step catalytic conversion  ap. 208-214.  aThe effect of storage temperature and time on lipid composition of Scenedesmus sp. was studied.

However, it remains unclear whether microRNAs (miRNAs), which are endogenous small regulatory RNAs, can also silence gene transcription. We investigated the regulation mechanism of let-7d on dopamine D3 receptor (DRD3) in immortalized renal proximal tubule (RPT) cells of rats, where let-7d has a predicted homologous target site within DRD3 promoter. We found that let-7d mimics repressed DRD3 expression at the transcription level in RPT cells. Let-7d induced DRD3 inhibition via DNA-methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) and DNA-methyltransferase 3b (DNMT3b) dependent DNA methylation and the inhibition could be abolished by 5′-aza-2′-deoxycytidine (5-aza-dc), a DNA methylation inhibitor. Let-7d induced DRD3 repression was associated with the recruitment of Argonaute 2 (AGO2) protein. Histone 3 lysine 9 dimethylation (H3K9me2) was involved in the let-7d induced DRD3 TGS, indicating the chromatin-level silencing. In conclusion, our results demonstrated that let-7d may induce DRD3 repression in a transcriptional manner by means of DNMTs dependent DNA methylation and histone modification. It is suggested that miRNAs may act as a transcriptional gene regulator via the recognition of the homologous target site within the gene promoter.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA methylation 3acomplementary genes 3adopamine receptors 3agene silencing 3ahistones 3alysine 3amicroRNA 3arats 3asmall interfering RNA 3atranscription (genetics) 0aTGS 0asiRNA 0amiRNA 0aDRD3 0aRPT 0aDNMT 0aDNMT1 0aDNMT3b 0a5-aza-dc 0aH3K9me2 0aH3K27me3 0aAGO 0aPTGS 0ancRNA 0aRITS 0aHDAC 0aEZH2 0apiRNAs 0a3′UTR 0aPCR 0aMS-PCR 0aMeCP2 0aLet-7d 0aDopamine D3 receptor 0aDNA methylation 0aTranscriptional gene silencing1 aCheng, Caiyu1 aHe, Duofen1 aShi, Weibin1 aFu, Chunjiang1 aWang, Xukai1 aZeng, Chunyu0 tGene.g2016 Apr. 15, v. 580, no. 2 p.89-95dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6378x0378-11197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gene.2015.12.0713Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01686naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100001600112245007100128300001600199520054300215592002800758650001900786650002200805650002300827650002400850650002500874650002300899650002300922650001100945650001800956650001800974650001300992650001301005653002801018653001401046653001501060653002301075700001801098700001901116700001501135773010501150852000901255655001201264IND60709833720221122223507.0200908e201307  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070983372DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMunde, V.G.10aBio-management of Alternaria solani causing early blight of tomato  ap. 996-998.  aTrichoderma viride significantly reduced fungal growth and recorded 90.18 per cent inhibition over control.

However, unlike processes related to organic consumption in private households, the implementation of organic foods in public food systems is hindered by constraints and barriers. This article explores the effects related to the introduction of organic foods in institutional foodservice and uses three different theoretical frameworks from organizational sociology to understand the implementation. The article draws on data collected for the evaluation of the Danish organic public procurement funding scheme. Results show that putting organic foods on the public plate seems to be a lot more than a technical foodservice challenge that can be met by a technical “fix” approach. Instead, the data show that organic conversion involves important elements of organizational changes.  aPublisher supplied data 3afood service 3afunding 3ahouseholds 3aissues and policy 3aorganic foods 3asales 0aorganic food 0apublic foodscapes 0acatering 0afoodservice 0apublic procurement1 aSylvest, Janne0 tJournal of foodservice business research.g2012 Jan. 1, v. 15, no. 1 p.64-83dTaylor & Francis Groupx1537-80397nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15378020.2011.650541  aDNAL 7aarticle01964naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006100148245011400209300001600323520080400339592002801143650001401171650001501185650001801200650001501218650001801233650001601251650001201267650001101279650001001290650001401300650001601314700002101330700002001351773012801371856008201499852000901581655001201590IND60682497120221122004817.0200128e202002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068249712DNAL7 a10.1007/s00436-019-06564-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFranken, Gabriele1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1891-867510aCan we be sure that the human Plasmodium exoerythrocytic developmental stages occur exclusively in the liver?  ap. 667-673.  aThe development cycle of the malaria parasite, Plasmodium sp., in humans takes place after an infected female Anopheles mosquito injects motile infective forms called sporozoites into the bloodstream. Sporozoites migrate via blood vessels to the liver. This pre-erythrocytic tissue stage is widely accepted to occur in humans exclusively in the liver, contrary to avian malaria where this may occur also in other parenchymatous organs. This concept is based on research conducted by English researchers Henry Shortt and P.C.C. Garnham in the late 1940s. Although Italian researchers as, e.g., Giulio Raffaele, additionally claimed the presence of the parasites in the bone marrow, this is not well acknowledged. So, the question remains whether there exists also a tissue life cycle stage in humans.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAnopheles 3aPlasmodium 3aavian malaria 3ablood flow 3ablood vessels 3abone marrow 3afemales 3ahumans 3aliver 3aparasites 3asporozoites1 aRichter, Joachim1 aLabisch, Alfons0 tParasitology research.g2020 Feb., v. 119, no. 2 p.667-673dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl3870072x0932-01137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00436-019-06564-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03366naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001200139245013900151300001800290520191100308592002802219650001602247650001902263650001402282650002302296650001202319650001102331650002102342650001702363650003002380650001802410650001702428650001602445650002302461650002602484650001102510650002202521700001702543700001702560700001302577700001502590700001402605700001802619700001602637700001802653773010502671856007502776852000902851655001202860IND60578029720221117064141.0170811e20141125xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057802972DNAL7 a10.1021/ma50191862doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Ye10aMechanistic Understanding of Dinuclear Cobalt(III) Complex Mediated Highly Enantioselective Copolymerization of meso-Epoxides with CO2  ap. 7775-7788.  aThe desymmetrization copolymerization of meso-epoxides with CO₂ using chiral catalysts or reagents is regarded as a valuable strategy for the synthesis of optically active polycarbonates with main-chain chirality. The present study demonstrates that the biphenol-linked dinuclear Co(III) complexes show unprecedented activity, enantioselectivity, and broad substrate scope for coupling CO₂ with various meso-epoxides to afford the corresponding isotactic polycarbonates. This investigation also focuses on the mechanistic understanding on the origin of enantioselectivity and highly catalytic activity in the enantiopure dinuclear Co(III) complex mediated copolymerization process, using cyclohexene oxide as a model monomer of meso-epoxides. The kinetic study by in situ infrared spectroscopy revealed a first-order dependence on the catalyst concentration in the systems of biphenol-linked dinuclear Co(III) complex alone or in the presence of an ionic cocatalyst. An intramolecular bimetallic cooperation mechanism was proposed to be predominantly responsible for the copolymerization process, wherein alternating chain growth and dissociation take turns between two Co(III) ions from the inside cleft of the catalyst by the nucleophilic attack of the growing carboxylate species at one metal center toward the activated epoxide at the other. Density functional theory calculations suggested that in the two diastereoisomers of the biphenol-linked dinuclear Co(III) complexes the matched configuration was (S,S,S,S,S)- rather than (S,S,R,S,S)-conformer for CO₂/meso-epoxide copolymerization to give the corresponding polycarbonate with S,S-configuration. The addition of an ionic cocatalyst with bulky cation significantly improves both the catalytic activity and enantioselectivity, while the presence of a coordination Lewis base caused dramatically a change in the chiral induction orientation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLewis bases 3acarbon dioxide 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3acations 3acobalt 3acopolymerization 3acyclohexenes 3adensity functional theory 3adiastereomers 3adissociation 3aenantiomers 3aenantioselectivity 3ainfrared spectroscopy 3amodels 3aoptical isomerism1 aRen, Wei-Min1 aLiu, Zhuang,1 aFu, Song1 aWang, Meng1 aHe, Ke-Ke1 aLi, Rong-Rong1 aZhang, Rong1 aLu, Xiao-Bing0 tMacromolecules.g2014 Nov. 25, v. 47, no. 22 p.7775-7788dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fma50191863Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02993naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100003400188245010900222300001200331506007600343520150100419592002801920506003701948650001601985650001702001650002302018650001402041650001502055650002102070650001302091650001202104650000902116650001602125650003302141650001702174650002502191650001302216700001902229700001502248700006402263773010502327856008202432852000902514655001202523IND60624627720221207051037.0190503e201812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062462772DNAL7 a10.1186/s12870-018-1569-x2doi7 aPMC62781252pmcid7 a305091792pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAnguraj Vadivel, Arun Kumaran10aGenome-wide identification and localization of chalcone synthase family in soybean (Glycine max [L]Merr)  ap. 325.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Soybean is a paleopolyploid that has undergone two whole genome duplication events. Gene duplication is a type of genomic change that can lead to novel functions of pre-existing genes. Chalcone synthase (CHS) is the plant-specific type III polyketide synthase that catalyzes the first committed step in (iso)flavonoid biosynthesis in plants. RESULTS: Here we performed a genome-wide search of CHS genes in soybean, and identified 21 GmCHS loci containing 14 unique GmCHS (GmCHS1-GmCHS14) that included 5 newly identified GmCHSs (GmCHS10-GmCHS14). Furthermore, 3 copies of GmCHS3 and 2 copies of GmCHS4 were found in soybean. Analysis of gene structure of GmCHSs revealed the presence of a single intron in protein-coding regions except for GmCHS12 that contained 3 introns. Even though GmCHS genes are located on 8 different chromosomes, a large number of these genes are present on chromosome 8 where they form 3 distinct clusters. Expression analysis of GmCHS genes revealed tissue-specific expression pattern, and that some GmCHS isoforms localize in the cytoplasm and the nucleus while other isoforms are restricted to cytoplasm only. CONCLUSION: Overall, we have identified 21 GmCHS loci with 14 unique GmCHS genes in the soybean genome. Their gene structures and genomic organization together with the spatio-temporal expression and protein localization suggest their importance in the production of downstream metabolites such as (iso)flavonoids and their derived phytoalexins.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aGlycine max 3abiosynthesis 3acatalytic activity 3acytoplasm 3aflavonoids 3agene duplication 3agenomics 3aintrons 3aloci 3ametabolites 3anaringenin-chalcone synthase 3aphytoalexins 3apolyketide synthases 3asoybeans1 aKrysiak, Kevin1 aTian, Gang1 aDhaubhadel, Sangeeta1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2582-55030 tBMC plant biology.g2018 Dec., v. 18, no. 1 p.325-325dBioMed CentralwJournal:2167x1471-22297nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12870-018-1569-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01162naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245012000157300002000277520022700297592002800524650002300552650002300575650001200598650001900610650000900629700001500638773013600653856007400789852000900863655001200872IND60660306820221120034245.0190823e20190820xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066030682DNAL7 a10.1039/c9cc04834k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGong, Yanmei10aHigh performance benzoimidazolyl-based aminophenolate zinc complexes for isoselective polymerization of rac-lactide  ap. 10112-10115.  aZinc complexes supported by achiral benzoimidazolyl-based aminophenolate ligands exhibit high catalytic activities and excellent isoselectivities toward the ring-opening polymerization of rac-lactide under mild conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaromatic compounds 3acatalytic activity 3aligands 3apolymerization 3azinc1 aMa, Haiyan0 tChemical communications.g2019 Aug. 20, v. 55, no. 68 p.10112-10115dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26910x1364-548X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c9cc04834k3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03200naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002300150245016200173300001600335520150200351592002801853650002101881650002901902650001301931650001901944650001301963650002001976650001001996650001102006650001602017650001502033650001702048650001602065650001202081650001702093650001402110650002502124650001602149650001402165653002902179653002702208653001702235700002002252700001902272700002302291700002402314700002302338700006202361700002102423773010802444856008502552852000902637655001202646IND60611072520221118062145.0200503e201809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061107252DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vetmic.2018.08.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMasukagami, Yumiko10aMetabolite profiling of Mycoplasma gallisepticum mutants, combined with bioinformatic analysis, can reveal the likely functions of virulence-associated genes  ap. 160-167.  aMycoplasma gallisepticum is an economically important pathogen of commercial poultry. An improved understanding of M. gallisepticum pathogenesis is required to develop better control methods. We recently identified a number of M. gallisepticum mutants with defects in colonization and persistence in chickens using signature-tagged transposon mutagenesis. Loss of virulence was associated with mutations in a putative oligopeptide/dipeptide (opp/dpp) ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter (where the transposon was inserted into the MGA_0220 (oppD₁) gene and two hypothetical proteins (encoded by MGA_1102 and MGA_0588), one of which (MGA_1102) contains a putative peptidase motif. To further characterise the function of these proteins, we compared the metabolome of each transposon mutant with that of wild type bacteria. Two independent LC/MS analyses revealed consistent significant decreases in the abundances of several amino acids and the dipeptide alanyl-glycine (Ala-Gly) in the MGA_0220 mutant, consistent with this protein being a peptide transporter. Similarly, lysine and Ala-Gly were significantly decreased in the MGA_1102 mutant, consistent with our bioinformatic analysis suggesting that MGA_1102 encodes a membrane-located peptidase. Few differences were observed in metabolite levels in the MGA_0588 mutant, suggesting that the disrupted protein has a non-metabolic role. Overall, this study indicates that metabolomics is a useful tool in the functional analysis of mutants.  aPublisher supplied data 3aABC transporters 3aMycoplasma gallisepticum 3abacteria 3abioinformatics 3achickens 3acontrol methods 3agenes 3alysine 3ametabolites 3ametabolome 3ametabolomics 3amutagenesis 3amutants 3apathogenesis 3apathogens 3apeptide transporters 3atransposons 3avirulence 0aMycoplasma gallisepticum 0aBacterial pathogenesis 0aMetabolomics1 aNijagal, Brunda1 aTseng, Chi-Wen1 aDayalan, Saravanan1 aTivendale, Kelly A.1 aMarkham, Philip F.1 aBrowning, Glenn F.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0903-24691 aSansom, Fiona M.0 tVeterinary microbiology.g2018 Sept., v. 223 p.160-167dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl8205x0378-11357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2018.08.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02392naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002400151245012300175300001800298520107700316592002801393650002301421650001201444650001201456650002001468650001201488650001601500650001301516653001301529653002201542653002201564700005601586700005901642700002001701700005601721700002301777773009901800856008601899852000901985655001201994IND60752246320221119165133.0211029e20211029xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075224632DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vaccine.2021.09.0582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFisher, Kimberly A.10aPreferences for COVID-19 vaccination information and location: Associations with vaccine hesitancy, race and ethnicity  ap. 6591-6594.  aThis study examined the association between preferences for being informed about the COVID-19 vaccine and where to receive it with vaccination intent and race/ethnicity. We conducted an online survey, oversampling Black and Latino panel members. The 1668 participants were 53.2% female, 34.8% White, 33.3% Black, and 31.8% Latino. Participants who were vaccine hesitant (answered “not sure” or “no” to vaccination intent) were more likely to prefer a conversation with their doctor compared to those who answered “yes” (25.0% and 23.4% vs 7.8%, P < .001, respectively). Among participants who responded “not sure”, 61.8% prefer to be vaccinated at a doctor’s office, compared with 35.2% of those who responded “yes” (P < .001). Preferred location differed by race/ethnicity (P < .001) with 67.6% of Black “not sure” participants preferring a doctor’s office compared to 60.2% of Latino and 54.9% of White “not sure” participants. These findings underscore the need to integrate healthcare providers into COVID-19 vaccination programs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCOVID-19 infection 3aLatinos 3afemales 3ahealth services 3asurveys 3avaccination 3avaccines 0aCOVID-19 0aCOVID-19 vaccines 0aVaccine hesitancy1 aNguyen, Ngoc1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8265-48461 aCrawford, Sybil1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6621-04391 aFouayzi, Hassan1 aSingh, Sonal1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0912-941X1 aMazor, Kathleen M.0 tVaccine.g2021 Oct. 29, v. 39, no. 45 p.6591-6594dElsevier LtdwJournal:6210x0264-410X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2021.09.0583Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01875naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094040001800138100001800156245011400174300001600288500002000304520080000324592002801124650002001152650001301172650001001185650001601195650001301211650001201224650001001236650001601246650001101262700001601273773013701289856009001426852000901516655001201525IND60579768020221120054102.0170830e19910112xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057976802DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1439-0418.1991.tb00335.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNag, Abhijeet10aEffect of moon light and lunar periodicity on the light trap catches of cutworm Agrotis ipsilon (Hufn.) moths  ap. 358-360.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe effect of moon light and lunar periodicity on the light trap catches of cutworm, Agrotis ipsilon (Hufn.) was studied during the active periods of 1986/87 and 1987/88 at Agriculture Research Farm of the Banaras Hindu University, Varanasi. In the light traps a mercury vapour electric bulb of 160 watt was used as the source of light. The moths caught in the traps were correlated with the light illumination of different days of a lunar cycle and it showed that trap catches were consistently very low on moonlit nights around full moon. The significant linear and negative correlation between degree of moon phase and light trap catches was observed. On an average, the response was higher in descending phase (full moon to no moon) as compared to the ascending phase (no moon to full moon).  aPublisher supplied data 3aAgrotis ipsilon 3acutworms 3afarms 3alight traps 3alighting 3amercury 3amoths 3aperiodicity 3avapors1 aNath, Paras0 tJournal of applied entomology.g1991 Jan. 12, v. 111, no. 1-5 p.358-360dBlackwell Publishing LtdwJournal:jnl57792x0931-20487nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1439-0418.1991.tb00335.x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02643naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002600139245008100165300001800246500002000264520170800284592002801992650001602020650002402036650001402060650001402074650001502088650002002103650002502123773009902148856007302247852000902320655001202329IND60569998820221121080833.0170626e200810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056999882DNAL7 a10.1890/07-1508.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAmarasekare, Priyanga10aCoexistence of intraguild predators and prey in resource‐rich environments  ap. 2786-2797.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe prevalence of intraguild predation (IGP) in productive environments has long puzzled ecologists. Theory predicts the exclusion of intraguild prey from such environments, but data consistently defy this expectation. This suggests that coexistence mechanisms at high resource productivity may differ from those at lower productivity. Here I present a mathematical model that investigates multiple coexistence mechanisms. I incorporate two biological features widely observed in IGP communities: intraspecific interference via cannibalism or superparasitism, and temporal refuges arising from differential sensitivities to abiotic variation. I develop predictions based on three aspects of the IG prey–IG predator interaction: mutual invasibility, transient dynamics, and long‐term abundances. These predictions specify the conditions under which coexistence mechanisms reinforce vs. deter one another: when a competition–IGP trade‐off allows coexistence at intermediate productivity a temporal refuge for the intraguild prey always allows coexistence at high productivity, but intraspecific interference does so only at a net fitness cost to the intraguild predator. Intraspecific interference that benefits the intraguild predator not only reduces trade‐off‐mediated coexistence at intermediate productivity, but also undermines the refuge's coexistence‐enhancing effect at high productivity. Different mechanism combinations yield characteristic signatures in time series data during transient dynamics. By judicious measurement of parameters and examining time series for critical signatures, one can elucidate the mechanisms that allow IGP to prevail in resource‐rich environments.  aPublisher supplied data 3acannibalism 3amathematical models 3apredation 3apredators 3aprediction 3asuperparasitism 3atime series analysis0 tEcology.g2008 Oct., v. 89, no. 10 p.2786-2797dEcological Society of Americax0012-96587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1890/07-1508.13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03654naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100005500188245008900243300001200332506007600344520168300420592002802103596009202131506003702223650001802260650001202278650002202290650001602312650001002328650002402338650001402362650001802376650001102394650002002405650001302425650002902438650001702467650000902484650001202493650001102505650002802516650001302544650002002557650001802577650001102595700005602606700001502662700001902677700002002696700001702716700005302733700005802786773010502844856008202949852000903031655001203040IND60624627820221207073414.0190503e201812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062462782DNAL7 a10.1186/s12870-018-1537-52doi7 aPMC62781582pmcid7 a305091672pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPereira, L.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5184-858710aQTL mapping of melon fruit quality traits using a high-density GBS-based genetic map  ap. 324.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Melon shows a broad diversity in fruit morphology and quality, which is still underexploited in breeding programs. The knowledge of the genetic basis of fruit quality traits is important for identifying new alleles that may be introduced in elite material by highly efficient molecular breeding tools. RESULTS: In order to identify QTLs controlling fruit quality, a recombinant inbred line population was developed using two commercial cultivars as parental lines: “Védrantais”, from the cantalupensis group, and “Piel de Sapo”, from the inodorus group. Both have desirable quality traits for the market, but their fruits differ in traits such as rind and flesh color, sugar content, ripening behavior, size and shape. We used a genotyping-by-sequencing strategy to construct a dense genetic map, which included around five thousand variants distributed in 824 bins. The RIL population was phenotyped for quality and morphology traits, and we mapped 33 stable QTLs involved in sugar and carotenoid content, fruit and seed morphology and major loci controlling external color of immature fruit and mottled rind. The median confidence interval of the QTLs was 942 kb, suggesting that the high density of the genetic map helped in increasing the mapping resolution. Some of these intervals contained less than a hundred annotated genes, and an integrative strategy combining gene expression and resequencing data enabled identification of candidate genes for some of these traits. CONCLUSION: Several QTLs controlling fruit quality traits in melon were identified and delimited to narrow genomic intervals, using a RIL population and a GBS-based genetic map.  aPublisher supplied data  aAGL2015-64625-C2-1-RcSecretaría de Estado de Investigación, Desarrollo e Innovación0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDNA shuffling 3aalleles 3abreeding programs 3acarotenoids 3acolor 3aconfidence interval 3acultivars 3afruit quality 3afruits 3agene expression 3agenomics 3agenotyping by sequencing 3ainbred lines 3aloci 3amarkets 3amelons 3aquantitative trait loci 3aripening 3aseed morphology 3asugar content 3asugars1 aRuggieri, V.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6038-87031 aPérez, S.1 aAlexiou, K.

S125.  aSocial media has emerged as a major influence on consumer health and behavior (Korda and Itani 2013). With more than a third of all U.S. adults using the social networking site Instagram (Pew Research Center 2017), food and dietary supplement marketing may be effective in building consumer awareness and furthermore influencing attitudes towards advertised products. Advertisements for detox tea products in particular are widely prevalent on social media, with celebrity endorsements being the most notable. However, little is known of what information detox tea brands include in marketing messages on the popular social networking site, Instagram.The purpose of this study was to analyze the content of detox tea advertisements on Instagram in order to understand how detox teas are being portrayed in social media.A qualitative content analysis explored how 11 detox tea brands advertised their products on Instagram. The use of health claims and nutrient claims in posts were also recorded. Detox tea brand posts were selected for analysis during Thanksgiving weekend of 2017. Previous research has shown that people are more health conscious during the holidays as body weight significantly increases (and is retained throughout the year) due to increased dietary intake during this time. A total of 220 posts were coded by researchers.Coding and identification of themes was conducted using the constant comparative method.Findings suggested structure-function claims were the most frequently used. Qualitative content analysis revealed five overarching themes in the content of detox tea posts on Instagram including advertising and promotion of products, two-way dialogue with the brand, brand connections, health and fitness and finally, social sharing.Exploring the content of these supplement advertisements provides insight on useful strategies for increasing brand engagement on social media. Additionally, analysis of this content supports research suggesting a connection between exposure to social media content and influencing consumer behavior.None.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadults 3aattitudes and opinions 3abody weight 3adietary supplements 3afood intake 3ahealth claims 3asocial networks 3atea 3aUnited States1 aBradshaw, Amanda1 aBajalia, Alexis1 aTreise, Debbie1 aShelton, Summer1 aCretul, Matthew1 aSeoane, Montserrat Carrera0 tJournal of nutrition education and behavior.g2019 July,  Aug., v. 51, no. 7 p.S125-S125dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl70490x1499-40467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jneb.2019.05.5813Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03567naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100003000154245015200184520234300336592002802679650001702707650001102724650002002735650001602755650002002771650003502791650001702826651001102843653002402854653002102878653002202899653002202921700003202943700002402975773009602999856008903095852000903184655001203193IND60752246520221119165048.0211129e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075224652DNAL7 a10.1016/j.landusepol.2021.1057712doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDaunt, Ana Beatriz Pierri14aThe role of spatial planning in land change: An assessment of urban planning and nature conservation efficiency at the southeastern coast of Brazil  aUrban expansion is expected to continue at a fast rate, precisely in peri-urban areas of developing countries surrounded by biodiversity hotspots. The need to assess and potentially restructure urban and environmental planning instruments becomes apparent in scenarios where urban expansion is difficult to manage. Indicators based on spatially explicit datasets have been suggested as effective tools to evaluate spatial planning outcomes because they can shed light on the efficiency of planning measures and the fulfilment of claimed goals. In this work, we evaluated the conformance of stated spatial planning goals and the outcomes in terms of urban compactness, basic services and housing provision, and nature conservation for different land-use strategies. We evaluate the 2005 Ecological-Economic Zoning (EEZ) and two municipal master plans from 2006 in a coastal region in São Paulo State, Brazil. We used Partial Least Squares Path Modelling (PLS-PM) to explain the relationship between the plan strategies and land-use change ten years after implementation in terms of urban compactness, basic services and housing increase, and nature conservation. Our findings suggest that the evaluated plans were influenced by the land-use pattern at the time when the plan was approved (2005). For all evaluated plans, the Urban Use strategy was important to explain the Urban Compactness, but most of the new urban isolated areas occurred outside of the zones where the Urban Use strategy was applied. Two out of three of the evaluated plans were considered efficient in terms of nature conservation. In general, the Urban Use strategy can be considered successful in promoting more compact patterns of new build-up areas (axial and infill growth), but not in containing the emergence of new isolated areas outside the zones with Urban Use strategy. Our findings are in line with those from similar studies showing that areas outside of urban cores are often deprived of efficient spatial planning. The increase in Basic Services and Housing was not sufficient to attend the regional demand, and the inadequacy of these services remains a problem in the region. Future policies for land-use management in NCSP need to address the increasing demand for basic services and housing and to enable urban development inside urban core areas.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiodiversity 3acoasts 3adata collection 3aland policy 3aland use change 3anatural resources conservation 3aurbanization 3aBrazil 0aNature conservation 0aPlanning outcome 0aSpatial modelling 0aUrban compactness1 aInostroza Fernández, Luis,1 aHersperger, Anna M.0 tLand use policy.g2021 Dec., v. 111 p.105771-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12412x0264-83777nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.landusepol.2021.1057713Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01858naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245009300167300001600260520081000276592002801086650001401114650001001128650001801138650001101156650000901167650001201176650001101188650001701199650002101216650001001237650001601247700003301263773010901296856008201405852000901487655001201496IND60120155620221120062100.0181002e201502  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012015562DNAL7 a10.1007/s10570-014-0494-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBenli, Hüseyin10aUse of ultrasound in biopreparation and natural dyeing of cotton fabric in a single bath  ap. 867-877.  aUse of enzymes in different parts of textile finishing processes has become popular, and several enzymes have been introduced into the textile industry.

After optimization of the enzyme-based ultrasound-aided finishing, the fabrics were also colored in the same bath using natural dyes of pomegranate peel, nutshell, orange tree leaf, and alkanet root. Finally, it was observed that ultrasound-aided biopreparation of cotton fabric could provide sufficient pretreatment results. Coloration of these fabrics could be achieved with the use of natural dyes in the same bath as biopreparation.  aPublisher supplied data 3acellulose 3acolor 3acotton fabric 3adyeing 3adyes 3aenzymes 3aleaves 3apomegranates 3atextile industry 3atrees 3aultrasonics1 aBahtiyari, Muhammed İbrahim0 tCellulose.g2015 Feb., v. 22, no. 1 p.867-877dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl3871471x0969-02397nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10570-014-0494-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03951naa a2200721 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001400151245014900165520176800314592002802082650002602110650001602136650001202152650001802164650001502182650001302197650001902210650002502229650001102254650001602265650004302281650002002324650002402344650002002368653001002388653001302398653001502411653000902426653001002435653001002445653001002455653000902465653000802474653001002482653001202492653003002504653000802534653000802542653001202550653000802562653000802570700002202578700001902600700005802619700002002677700001602697700002902713700002202742700002002764700002102784700005702805700002002862700005902882700006202941773011903003856008603122852000903208655001203217IND60743886920221120144335.0211009e202111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074388692DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jnutbio.2021.1088112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWada, Eri10aDisordered branched chain amino acid catabolism in pancreatic islets is associated with postprandial hypersecretion of glucagon in diabetic mice  aDysregulation of glucagon is associated with the pathophysiology of type 2 diabetes. We previously reported that postprandial hyperglucagonemia is more obvious than fasting hyperglucagonemia in type 2 diabetes patients. However, which nutrient stimulates glucagon secretion in the diabetic state and the underlying mechanism after nutrient intake are unclear. To answer these questions, we measured plasma glucagon levels in diabetic mice after oral administration of various nutrients. The effects of nutrients on glucagon secretion were assessed using islets isolated from diabetic mice and palmitate-treated islets. In addition, we analyzed the expression levels of branched chain amino acid (BCAA) catabolism-related enzymes and their metabolites in diabetic islets. We found that protein, but not carbohydrate or lipid, increased plasma glucagon levels in diabetic mice. Among amino acids, BCAAs, but not the other essential or nonessential amino acids, increased plasma glucagon levels. BCAAs also directly increased the intracellular calcium concentration in α cells. When BCAAs transport was suppressed by an inhibitor of system L-amino acid transporters, glucagon secretion was reduced even in the presence of BCAAs. We also found that the expression levels of BCAA catabolism-related enzymes and their metabolite contents were altered in diabetic islets and palmitate-treated islets compared to control islets, indicating disordered BCAA catabolism in diabetic islets. Furthermore, BCKDK inhibitor BT2 suppressed BCAA-induced hypersecretion of glucagon in diabetic islets and palmitate-treated islets. Taken together, postprandial hypersecretion of glucagon in the diabetic state is attributable to disordered BCAA catabolism in pancreatic islet cells.  aPublisher supplied data 3aamino acid metabolism 3aamino acids 3acalcium 3acarbohydrates 3acatabolism 3aglucagon 3ahypersecretion 3aislets of Langerhans 3alipids 3ametabolites 3anoninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 3anutrient intake 3aoral administration 3apathophysiology 0aBCAAs 0aDiabetes 0aAlpha cell 0aBCAA 0aBCAT2 0aBCKDH 0aBCKDK 0aBCKA 0aLAT 0a4F2hc 0aBCA-CoA 0aPPM1K2+/Mn2+ dependent 1K 0aBCH 0aBT2 0a[Ca2+]i 0aHFD 0aSTZ1 aKobayashi, Masaki1 aKohno, Daisuke1 aKikuchi, Osamu1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1364-95651 aSuga, Takayoshi1 aMatsui, Sho1 aYokota-Hashimoto, Hiromi1 aHonzawa, Norikiyo1 aIkeuchi, Yuichi1 aTsuneoka, Haruka1 aHirano, Touko1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4386-375X1 aObinata, Hideru1 aSasaki, Tsutomu1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8041-19151 aKitamura, Tadahiro1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8809-87400 tJournal of nutritional biochemistry.g2021 Nov., v. 97 p.108811-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl44770x0955-28637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jnutbio.2021.1088113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02427naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094040001800138100001300156245015000169300001600319500002000335520122100355592002801576650001301604650002701617650002601644650001101670650001101681650002201692650001701714650002601731650001401757650001601771650001301787700001701800773013701817856009001954852000902044655001202053IND60579768120221121060747.0170830e19910112xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057976812DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1439-0418.1991.tb00334.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBenz, G.10aPreliminary studies on wound‐ and PIIF‐induced resistance in some solanaceous plants against Spodoptera littoralis (Boisd.)

While the leaves of the wounded seedlings kept at the low temperature did not exhibit significant changes in palatability, the wounded plants maintained at the high temperature showed a significant reduction in their acceptability for the larvae. However, when the leaves of two other solanaceous plants, Solanum pseudocapsicum and Physalis alkehengi, favoring low temperature conditions were wounded and kept at 20 °C., a significant reduction in the acceptability of their leaves for S. littoralis larvae was observed. Treatment of the excised tomato leaves with crude proteinase inhibitor inducing factor (PIIF) according to Ryan (1974) for 15 min did not result in a significant decline in their palatability. The possibility of the presence of a transportable factor other than “PIIF” and “Proteinase Inhibitors” and the importance of consideration of the essential factors influencing the translocation of endogenous substances in the wounded plants are discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPhysalis 3aSolanum pseudocapsicum 3aSpodoptera littoralis 3alarvae 3aleaves 3amechanical damage 3apalatability 3aproteinase inhibitors 3aseedlings 3atemperature 3atomatoes1 aAbivardi, C.0 tJournal of applied entomology.g1991 Jan. 12, v. 111, no. 1-5 p.349-357dBlackwell Publishing LtdwJournal:jnl57792x0931-20487nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1439-0418.1991.tb00334.x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02244naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001600139245008700155300001800242500002000260520125600280592002801536650001301564650001701577650001401594650001301608650001101621650002401632650002501656650002501681700001901706773009901725856007301824852000901897655001201906IND60569998920221121081718.0170626e200811  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056999892DNAL7 a10.1890/07-1988.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBecks, Lutz10aTransitions from stable equilibria to chaos, and back, in an experimental food web  ap. 3222-3226.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe question of whether deterministic chaos occurs in natural populations has been discussed since the 1970s following the discovery that simple population models can generate chaotic dynamics. Natural populations undergo a diverse mixture of deterministic and stochastic processes that define population dynamics. In most habitats populations are also exposed to changes in biotic and abiotic parameters. Models predict that shifts in ecological parameters may lead to a transition between deterministic chaos, stable equilibria, and limit cycles, yet clear examples from empirical studies are rare. However, such transitions should be considered when discussing the occurrence of chaos in nature because ecological time series are in general short and have large sampling intervals. Here we document short‐term transitions in population dynamics to and from chaos in an experimental system. Manipulation of only one experimental parameter (chemostat dilution rate) in a multi‐species food web of two bacteria and a bacterivorous ciliate showed that switching between different dynamic behaviors occured with surprising rapidity in the microbial populations. Thus, short periods of chaotic dynamics may easily be overlooked in field observations.  aPublisher supplied data 3abacteria 3abacterivores 3afood webs 3ahabitats 3amodels 3apopulation dynamics 3astochastic processes 3atime series analysis1 aArndt, Hartmut0 tEcology.g2008 Nov., v. 89, no. 11 p.3222-3226dEcological Society of Americax0012-96587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1890/07-1988.13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02980naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100002100166245012100187300001800308520156100326592002801887650001401915650001401929650002401943650002101967650001901988650001802007650001102025650001102036650001102047650001702058650001502075651001102090653002102101653001902122653001102141653001502152653003002167700002802197700003302225700003202258773012902290856008202419852000902501655001202510IND60517502920221117060122.0190803e201604  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051750292DNAL7 a260546462pmid7 a10.1017/S13689800150015242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDuran, Ana Clara14aThe role of the local retail food environment in fruit, vegetable and sugar-sweetened beverage consumption in Brazil  ap. 1093-1102.  aTo examine the relationship between the local retail food environment and consumption of fruits and vegetables (FV) and sugar-sweetened beverages (SSB) in São Paulo, Brazil, as well as the moderation effects of income in the studied relationships. Cross-sectional study design that drew upon neighbourhood- and individual-level data. For each participant, community (density and proximity) and community food environment (availability, variety, quality and price) measures of FV and SSB were assessed in retail food stores and specialized fresh produce markets within 1·6 km of their homes. Poisson generalized estimating equations (GEE) were used to model the associations of food consumption with food environment measures, adjusted by individual-level characteristics. São Paulo, Brazil. Adults (n 1842) residing in the same census tracts (n 52) in São Paulo, Brazil as those where the neighbourhood-level measures were taken. FV availability in neighbourhoods was associated with regular FV consumption (≥5 times/week; prevalence ratio=1·41; 95 % CI 1·19, 1·67). Regular FV consumption prevalence was significantly lower among lower-income individuals living in neighbourhoods with fewer supermarkets and fresh produce markets (P-interaction <0·05). A greater variety of SSB was associated with a 15 % increase in regular SSB consumption (≥5 times/week) prevalence, after adjustment for confounding variables. Our findings suggest that the local retail food environment is associated with FV and SSB consumption in a Brazilian urban sample.  aPublisher supplied data 3abeverages 3aequations 3aexperimental design 3afood consumption 3afood retailing 3afresh produce 3afruits 3aincome 3aprices 3asupermarkets 3avegetables 3aBrazil 0aFood environment 0aNeighbourhoods 0aFruits 0aVegetables 0aSugar-sweetened beverages1 ade Almeida, Samuel Luna1 aLatorre, Maria do Rosario DO1 aJaime, Patrícia Constante,0 tPublic health nutrition.g2016 Apr., v. 19, no. 6 p.1093-1102dCambridge University PresswJournal:jnl56775x1475-27277nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S13689800150015243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02882naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001700139245013300156300001800289520168100307592002801988650001602016650001202032650001302044650001302057650003602070650001902106650001302125650002202138650001902160650001602179700001802195700002002213700002002233700001902253700002302272773010502295856007502400852000902475655001202484IND60578029920180802000000.0170811e20141125xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057802992DNAL7 a10.1021/ma50193892doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHe, Jianghua10aChain Propagation and Termination Mechanisms for Polymerization of Conjugated Polar Alkenes by [Al]-Based Frustrated Lewis Pairs  ap. 7765-7774.  aA combined experimental and theoretical study on mechanistic aspects of polymerization of conjugated polar alkenes by frustrated Lewis pairs (FLPs) based on N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC) and Al(C₆F₅)₃ pairs is reported. This study consists of three key parts: structural characterization of active propagating intermediates, propagation kinetics, and chain-termination pathways. Zwitterionic intermediates that simulate the active propagating species in such polymerization have been generated or isolated from the FLP activation of monomers such as 2-vinylpyridine and 2-isopropenyl-2-oxazolineone of which, IMes⁺-CH₂C(Me)(C₃H₂NO)Al(C₆F₅)₃– (2), has been structurally characterized. Kinetics performed on the polymerization of 2-vinylpyridine by IᵗBu/Al(C₆F₅)₃ revealed that the polymerization follows a zero-order dependence on monomer concentration and a first-order dependence on initiator (IᵗBu) and activator [Al(C₆F₅)₃] concentrations, indicating a bimolecular, activated monomer propagation mechanism. The Lewis pair polymerization of conjugate polar alkenes such as methacrylates is accompanied by competing chain-termination side reactions; between the two possible chain-termination pathways, the one that proceeds via intramolecular backbiting cyclization involving nucleophilic attack of the activated ester group of the growing polymer chain by the O-ester enolate active chain end to generate a six-membered lactone (δ-valerolactone)-terminated polymer chain is kinetically favored, but thermodynamically disfavored, over the pathway leading to the β-ketoester-terminated chain, as revealed by computational studies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLewis bases 3aalkenes 3aaluminum 3acarbenes 3aheterocyclic nitrogen compounds 3apolymerization 3apolymers 3asequence analysis 3athermodynamics 3azwitterions1 aZhang, Yuetao1 aFalivene, Laura1 aCaporaso, Lucia1 aCavallo, Luigi1 aChen, Eugene Y.-X.0 tMacromolecules.g2014 Nov. 25, v. 47, no. 22 p.7765-7774dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fma50193893Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04018naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002400139245010100163300001800264500002000282520261800302592002802920650002102948650001202969650001602981650001502997650002503012650002103037650001403058650001603072650002303088650002103111650001503132650001403147650001503161650002203176700002303198700002803221700001903249700002203268700001903290700002403309773013303333856007303466852000903539655001203548IND60587643220221120205449.0180102e201409  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058764322DNAL7 a10.1890/13-0979.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGreen, Stephanie J.10aLinking removal targets to the ecological effects of invaders: a predictive model and field test  ap. 1311-1322.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aSpecies invasions have a range of negative effects on recipient ecosystems, and many occur at a scale and magnitude that preclude complete eradication. When complete extirpation is unlikely with available management resources, an effective strategy may be to suppress invasive populations below levels predicted to cause undesirable ecological change. We illustrated this approach by developing and testing targets for the control of invasive Indo‐Pacific lionfish (Pterois volitans and P. miles) on Western Atlantic coral reefs. We first developed a size‐structured simulation model of predation by lionfish on native fish communities, which we used to predict threshold densities of lionfish beyond which native fish biomass should decline. We then tested our predictions by experimentally manipulating lionfish densities above or below reef‐specific thresholds, and monitoring the consequences for native fish populations on 24 Bahamian patch reefs over 18 months. We found that reducing lionfish below predicted threshold densities effectively protected native fish community biomass from predation‐induced declines. Reductions in density of 25–92%, depending on the reef, were required to suppress lionfish below levels predicted to overconsume prey. On reefs where lionfish were kept below threshold densities, native prey fish biomass increased by 50–70%. Gains in small (<6 cm) size classes of native fishes translated into lagged increases in larger size classes over time. The biomass of larger individuals (>15 cm total length), including ecologically important grazers and economically important fisheries species, had increased by 10–65% by the end of the experiment. Crucially, similar gains in prey fish biomass were realized on reefs subjected to partial and full removal of lionfish, but partial removals took 30% less time to implement. By contrast, the biomass of small native fishes declined by >50% on all reefs with lionfish densities exceeding reef‐specific thresholds. Large inter‐reef variation in the biomass of prey fishes at the outset of the study, which influences the threshold density of lionfish, means that we could not identify a single rule of thumb for guiding control efforts. However, our model provides a method for setting reef‐specific targets for population control using local monitoring data. Our work is the first to demonstrate that for ongoing invasions, suppressing invaders below densities that cause environmental harm can have a similar effect, in terms of protecting the native ecosystem on a local scale, to achieving complete eradication.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPterois volitans 3abiomass 3acoral reefs 3aecosystems 3aenvironmental impact 3afish communities 3afisheries 3aforage fish 3aindigenous species 3ainvasive species 3amonitoring 3apredation 3aprediction 3asimulation models1 aDulvy, Nicholas K.1 aBrooks, Annabelle M.

Inward-rectifier K⁺ (Kir) channels are often activated by anionic lipids endemic to their native membranes and require accessible water along their K⁺ conductance pathway. To better understand Kir channel activation, we target multiple mutants of the Kir channel KirBac1.1 via solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (SSNMR) spectroscopy, potassium efflux assays, and Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) measurements. In the I131C stability mutant (SM), we observe an open-active channel in the presence of anionic lipids with greater activity upon addition of cardiolipin (CL). The introduction of three R to Q mutations (R49/151/153Q (triple Q mutant, TQ)) renders the protein inactive within the same activating lipid environment. Our SSNMR experiments reveal a stark reduction of lipid–protein interactions in the TQ mutant explaining the dramatic loss of channel activity. Water-edited SSNMR experiments further determined the TQ mutant possesses greater overall solvent exposure in comparison to wild-type but with reduced water accessibility along the ion conduction pathway, consistent with the closed state of the channel. These experiments also suggest water is proximal to the selectivity filter of KirBac1.1 in the open-activated state but that it may not directly enter the selectivity filter. Our findings suggest lipid binding initiates a concerted rotation of the cytoplasmic domain subunits, which is stabilized by multiple intersubunit salt bridges. This action buries ionic side chains away from the bulk water, while allowing water greater access to the K⁺ conduction pathway. This work highlights universal membrane protein motifs, including lipid–protein interactions, domain rearrangement, and water-mediated diffusion mechanisms.  aPublisher supplied data 3acardiolipins 3aenergy transfer 3amutants 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3apotassium 3apotassium channels 3asolvents1 aVersteeg, Derek B.1 aAmani, Reza1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8501-26891 aYekefallah, Maryam1 aKhan, Nazmul H.1 aWylie, Benjamin J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8183-27620 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2020 July 23, v. 142, no. 33 p.14102-14116dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19166x1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jacs.0c019913Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01820naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245007800166300001600244520075300260592002801013650002301041650001501064650002501079650001601104653001901120653001701139653001701156653002601173653002301199653003601222700002801258773012401286856005101410852000901461655001201470IND50088586220221119224703.0140414e20120401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008858622DNAL7 a10.1080/15378020.2012.6773782doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHa, Jooyeon10aConsumer Dining Value: Does It Vary Across Different Restaurant Segments?  ap. 123-142.  aThis study examined consumer value in three different restaurant segments: fast food, casual dining, and fine dining restaurants.

Using a long‐term individual and state‐dependent capture–recapture data on Storm Petrels (Hydrobates pelagicus) we analyzed whether breeding experience and current breeding investment were associated with the expression of the cost of reproduction in terms of reduced survival and/or future breeding performance. We found a positive relationship between current breeding investment, breeding experience, and future survival and an improvement in breeding performance with individual experience independently of the previous breeding outcome. Our results suggest that the survival cost paid by first‐time breeders and the positive correlation between reproduction and survival corresponds to selection against low quality birds unrelated to the breeding effort. Our work outlines the need to investigate the effect of multiple individual traits on different life history trade‐offs simultaneously.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHydrobates pelagicus 3abirds 3abreeding 3alife history 3areproductive performance1 aTavecchia, Giacomo1 aPradel, Roger1 aMínguez, Eduardo1 aOro, Daniel0 tEcology.g2008 Nov., v. 89, no. 11 p.3195-3203dEcological Society of Americax0012-96587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1890/08-0431.13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02077naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001300145245007100158300001600229520114800245592002801393650001101421650001501432650001101447650002701458650001101485650001601496650001801512650001201530700002201542700001701564773010101581856004801682852000901730655001201739IND4472605120221120103234.0120727e201201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447260512DNAL7 a10.1007/s11269-011-9916-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMix, Ken10aEnvironmental Drivers of Streamflow Change in the Upper Rio Grande  ap. 253-272.  aThe purpose of this study was to assess changes in streamflow in the Upper Rio Grande (URG) basin, as it exits the San Luis Valley (SLV) at the Lobatos gauge station, in relation to changes in local environmental drivers. Irrigation-dependent agriculture accounts for more than 85% of surface and ground water withdrawals in the SLV. Inflows of the Rio Grande and the Conejos and Los Piños rivers were aggregated into a single inflow into the SLV. Streamflow data were taken from gauges above all major diversions. Results of the analysis indicated annual streamflow at Lobatos declined by 400 hm3 after 1924, coinciding with increases in surface water extractions. Additional reductions of about 50 hm3 in annual streamflow, not accounted for by inflow reductions during the period 1925–1964, coincided with increases in groundwater extractions. In contrast, an increase of 12.5 hm3 in annual streamflow occurred during 1965–2007. The increases coincided with several changes, but were primarily related to extreme peak flow years during the period 1985–1987 and increased water deliveries in compliance with the Rio Grande Compact.  aPublisher supplied data 3abasins 3acompliance 3agauges 3agroundwater extraction 3arivers 3astream flow 3asurface water 3avalleys1 aLopes, Vicente L.1 aRast, Walter0 tWater resources management.g2012 Jan., v. 26, no. 1 p.253-272dSpringer-Verlagx0920-47417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11269-011-9916-9  aDNAL 7aarticle02499naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100003000147245013100177300001000308520129700318592002801615650001501643650000901658650001001667650001701677650001201694650001201706650001801718650001601736650001701752650000901769650001001778650001501788651001201803651001101815651000901826700002501835700002301860773010401883856008101987852000902068655001202077IND60477908020221118030417.0160220e201602  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6047790802DNAL7 a10.1007/s00114-015-1331-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOliveira, Édison Vicente10aTaxonomy, affinities, and paleobiology of the tiny metatherian mammal Minusculodelphis, from the early Eocene of South America  ap. 6.  aWith less than 3 g of estimated body mass, the early Eocene Minusculodelphis minimus Paula Couto (Mammalia, Metatheria, Jaskhadelphyidae) is one of the smallest mammals, living or extinct. It has alternatively been regarded as a didelphid or a derorhynchid “ameridelphian,” or even as an eometatherian marsupial. Here, we describe a new species of Minusculodelphis coming from the same locality (Itaboraí Quarry, Brazil) and age (Itaboraian age) of the type species of the genus. It differs from M. minimus in its larger size and several dental characters. The new species offers data on the upper dentition and femur, which are unknown in the type species. Compared to other Paleogene metatherians, Minusculodelphis shows closer relationships with Jaskhadelphys, from the early Paleocene of Tiupampa, Bolivia, as well as with Kiruwamaq, from the late Eocene-early Oligocene of Perú. A cladistic analysis places all three genera within the family Jaskhadelphyidae (Metatheria, Order indet.), which includes small to tiny, insectivorous-like metatherians. We argue that insectivory (soft insects) is the best-supported diet for both species of Minusculodelphis, and that the most probable microhabitat for them was the understorey or leaf litter of tropical, rain forested environments.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMetatheria 3adiet 3afemur 3ainsectivores 3ainsects 3amammals 3amicrohabitats 3anew species 3aplant litter 3arain 3ateeth 3aunderstory 3aBolivia 3aBrazil 3aPeru1 aZimicz, Ana Natalia,1 aGoin, Francisco J.0 tNaturwissenschaften.g2016 Feb., v. 103, no. 1-2 p.6-6dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx0028-10427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00114-015-1331-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02845naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002500150245014300175300001600318506010400334506007600438520104400514592002801558506003701586650002101623650001501644650001901659650001501678650001501693650002301708650001601731650001301747650001201760650001001772650001001782650001501792650001301807650001201820650001401832650001501846653001401861653002101875653001201896653001301908653001901921700001901940700002301959700002201982700002302004700002102027700003202048773009302080856008502173852000902258655001202267IND60772524920221207071848.0220412s2022    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077252492DNAL7 a10.1016/j.toxrep.2022.03.0362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKrutmuang, Patcharin14aThe inhibitory action of plant extracts on the mycelial growth of Ascosphaera apis, the causative agent of chalkbrood disease in Honey bee  ap. 713-719.  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aAscosphaera apis is a fungal pathogen, which causes chalkbrood disease in bees and is threatening beekeeping worldwide. The demand for organic honey for export has lately heightened hence the biological control is the option. This study aimed at the in vitro evaluation of the potency of plant extracts against chalkbrood disease for the possibility of being employed as a biological control strategy. The results showed that the combination of plant extracts from cinnamon with spearmint, cinnamon with lemongrass, cinnamon with geranium, and cinnamon with palmarosa at a concentration of 25% and 12.5% inhibited mycelial growth of A. apis by 100%. This demonstrated the potentiality of combining different plant extracts in controlling this disease. In addition, oregano caused inhibition of up to 100% singly. Conclusively, cinnamon in combination with several extracts has a great potential in curbing this disease while oregano offers an amazing remedy and hence the best formulations should be generated for the beekeeper to utilize.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAscosphaera apis 3aCymbopogon 3aMentha spicata 3aapiculture 3abeekeepers 3abiological control 3achalk brood 3acinnamon 3aexports 3afungi 3ahoney 3ahoney bees 3amycelium 3aoregano 3apathogens 3atoxicology 0aHoney bee 0aAscosphaera apis 0aOregano 0aCinnamon 0aPlant extracts1 aRajula, Julius1 aPittarate, Sarayut1 aChatima, Chanchai1 aThungrabeab, Malee1 aMekchay, Supamit1 aSenthil-Nathan, Sengottayan0 tToxicology reports.g2022, v. 9 p.713-719dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23254x2214-75007nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.toxrep.2022.03.0363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03089naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245013200170300001200302520162200314592002801936650001701964650002501981650001502006650001702021650001902038650002202057650001602079650001002095650001402105650001202119650002202131650002002153650003102173650001002204650001302214650002102227650002902248650001402277650001802291650001702309700001702326700002402343700002502367773011302392856008102505852000902586655001202595IND60572353020221121011042.0170717e201704  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057235302DNAL7 a10.1007/s11738-017-2398-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGeorge, K.

Black pepper, a major spice cultivated across the globe, is drought sensitive and water stress often results in plant death. The present study compared the difference in physiological parameters: relative water content (RWC) and cell membrane leakage, and also analyzed the differential expression of 11 drought responsive genes in drought tolerant and drought sensitive black pepper genotypes. Tolerant black pepper genotype exhibited significantly higher RWC and lower cell membrane leakage 10 days after stress induction than the sensitive genotype. The relative expressions of the 11 selected drought responsive genes were normalized against ubiquitin and RNA-binding protein which was identified as the most stable reference genes in black pepper under the present experimental condition using the RefFinder software. Dehydrin showed the highest transcript accumulation in both the black pepper genotypes under drought stress condition and the relative expression of the gene was higher in the tolerant genotype compared to the susceptible. Similar pattern of higher relative expression was also observed in the stress responsive gene, osmotin. The membrane protein aquaporin and the transcription factor bZIP were relatively down-regulated in the tolerant genotype.

In R. solanacearum, the hypersensitive response and pathogenicity (Hrp) type III secretion system is required for both the ability to induce the hypersensitive response (HR) in nonhost plants and pathogenicity in host plants. Recently, 72 effector genes, called rip (Ralstonia protein injected into plant cells), have been identified in R. solanacearum RS1000. RS1002, a spontaneous nalixidic acid‐resistant derivative of RS1000, induced strong HR in the nonhost wild eggplant Solanum torvum in an Hrp‐dependent manner. An Agrobacterium‐mediated transient expression system revealed that Rip36, a putative Zn‐dependent protease effector of R. solanacearum, induced HR in S. torvum. A mutation in the putative Zn‐binding motif (E149A) completely abolished the ability to induce HR. In agreement with this result, the RS1002‐derived Δrip36 and rip36E149A mutants lost the ability to induce HR in S. torvum. An E149A mutation had no effect on the translocation of Rip36 into plant cells. These results indicate that Rip36 is an avirulent factor that induces HR in S. torvum and that a putative Zn‐dependent protease motif is essential for this activity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aeggplants 3aSolanum torvum 3awilting 3abacterial wilt 3aproteinases 3ahost plants 3amutation 3acells 3apathogenicity 3atype III secretion system 3agenes 3aRalstonia solanacearum 3amutants 3ahypersensitive response 3abacteria 2aAgrobacteriumxphysiology 2aBacterial Proteinsxmetabolism 2aBacterial Secretion Systems 2aMutationxgenetics 2aPlant Leavesxmicrobiology 2aProtein Stability 2aRalstonia solanacearumxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aSolanumximmunologyxmicrobiology. 0aType III secretion system1 aMatsumoto, Iyo1 aTaguchi, Fumiko1 aInagaki, Yoshishige1 aYamamoto, Mikihiro1 aToyoda, Kazuhiro1 aShiraishi, Tomonori1 aIchinose, Yuki1 aMukaihara, Takafumi0 tMolecular plant pathology.g2014 Apr., v. 15, no. 3 p.297-303dBlackwell Science in collaboration with the British Society of Plant PathologywJournal:jnl60298x1464-67227nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/mpp.120793Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02456naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002100094024004500115024001100160040001800171100002000189245006300209300001600272506017300288520098100461650002601442650001801468650002601486650002301512650001401535650001501549650001401564650001901578650001601597700002501613700002401638773009501662856011201757856005801869956010101927961000902028852000902037655001202046IND50070274620221117003800.0130918s2012    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007027462DNAL7 a10113/578022hdl7 adoi:10.1016/j.prevetmed.2012.01.0072doi8 ans3323  aAGLbengcAGL1 aScott, Aaron E.10aNational animal health surveillance: Return on investment.  ap. 265-270.  aWorks produced by employees of the U.S. Government as part of their official duties are not copyrighted within the U.S. The content of this document is not copyrighted.  aA weighted benefit–cost analysis (BCA) supports prioritization of animal health surveillance activities to safeguard animal agriculture industries and reduce the impact of disease on the national economy. We propose to determine the value of investment in surveillance by assessing benefits from: avoiding disease incursion and expansion modified by the probability of occurrence of the disease event, the sensitivity of systems to detect it, and the degree to which we can mitigate disease impact when detected. The weighted benefit–cost ratio is the modified value of surveillance as laid out above divided by the cost of surveillance. We propose flexible, stream-based surveillance that capitalizes on combining multiple streams of information from both specific pathogen based and non-pathogen based surveillance. This stream-based type of system provides high value with lower costs and will provide a high return for the funds invested in animal health surveillance. 3aagricultural industry 3aanimal health 3acost benefit analysis 3adisease occurrence 3alivestock 3amonitoring 3apathogens 3aprioritization 3aprobability1 aForsythe, Kenneth W.1 aJohnson, Cynthia L.0 tPreventive veterinary medicine.g2012, v. 105 p.265-270wJournal:jnl34182x0167-58777nnas40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/578023Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/doi:10.1016/j.prevetmed.2012.01.007  aARIS submissionbhttp://submit-u.nal.usda.gov/system/files/submissions/116104_PVM_2012_105_4.pdf  aUSDA  aDNAL 7aarticle03206naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100003000151245014000181520170200321592002802023650001402051650000902065650001202074650001002086650001902096650001702115650002202132650002102154650002302175650002402198650002202222650001702244653004002261653001302301700006302314700006202377700006502439700006602504773011902570856008602689852000902775655001202784IND60743887120221120144318.0211106e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074388712DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jnutbio.2021.1088132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAkerele, Olatunji Anthony10aMaternal omega-3 fatty acids maintained positive maternal lipids and cytokines profile, and improved pregnancy outcomes of C57BL/6 mice  aOmega (n)-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) are known to regulate lipid metabolism and inflammation; however, the regulation of maternal lipid metabolism and cytokines profile by n-3 PUFA during different gestation stages, and its impact on fetal sustainability is not known. We investigated the effects of maternal diet varying in n-3 PUFA prior to, and during gestation, on maternal metabolic profile, placental inflammatory cytokines, and fetal outcomes. Female C57BL/6 mice were fed either a high, low or very low (9, 3 or 1% w/w n-3 PUFA) diet, containing n-6:n-3 PUFA of 5:1, 20:1 and 40:1, respectively for two weeks before mating, and throughout pregnancy. Animals were sacrificed prior to mating (NP), and during pregnancy at gestation days 6.5, 12.5 and 18.5. Maternal metabolic profile, placental cytokines and fetal outcomes were determined. Our results show for the first time that a maternal diet high in n-3 PUFA prevented dyslipidemia in NP mice, and maintained the expected lipid profile during pregnancy. However, females fed the very low n-3 PUFA diet became hyperlipidemic prior to pregnancy, and carried this profile into pregnancy. Maternal diet high in n-3 PUFA maintained maternal plasma progesterone and placental pro-inflammatory cytokines profile, and sustained fetal numbers throughout pregnancy, while females fed the low and very-low n-3 PUFA diet had fewer fetuses. Our findings demonstrate the importance of maternal diet before, and during pregnancy, to maintain maternal metabolic profile and fetus sustainability. These findings are important when designing dietary strategies to optimize maternal metabolism during pregnancy for successful pregnancy outcome.  aPublisher supplied data 3acytokines 3adiet 3afemales 3afetus 3ahyperlipidemia 3ainflammation 3alipid composition 3alipid metabolism 3amaternal nutrition 3aomega-3 fatty acids 3apregnancy outcome 3aprogesterone 0aOmega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids 0aPlacenta1 aManning, Sarah Jane1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0954-15461 aDixon, Sarah Emily1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1274-30151 aLacey, Amelia Estelle1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5790-21341 aCheema, Sukhinder Kaur1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4806-76480 tJournal of nutritional biochemistry.g2021 Dec., v. 98 p.108813-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl44770x0955-28637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jnutbio.2021.1088133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03255naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002700148245013700175300001600312520193500328592002802263650002602291650002202317650003402339650001102373650001102384650001002395650001702405650001102422650001802433650001502451650001802466650002802484651001302512651002502525651001302550700002102563700002302584773013502607856008202742852000902824655001202833IND60662399420221120190814.0190904e201909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066239942DNAL7 a10.1007/s10658-019-01753-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSattar, Muhammad Naeem10aCompatibility and interaction of begomoviruses and DNA-satellites causing leaf curl disease in Asia, Africa and Mediterranean Region  ap. 111-124.  aA complex of begomoviruses and their associated DNA-satellites is causing leaf curl diseases in Asia, Africa and the Mediterranean Region. Begomoviruses and DNA-satellites native to Asia and Africa are distinct from each other. Different combinations of geographically distinct monopartite begomoviruses, betasatellites and an alphasatellite were analyzed in infection experiments: cotton leaf curl Kokhran virus (CLCuKoV) and cotton leaf curl Multan virus (CLCuMuV) from Pakistan along with their associated cotton leaf curl Multan betasatellite (CLCuMuB); okra yellow crinkle virus (OYCrV), cotton leaf curl Gezira betasatellite (CLCuGeB), ageratum leaf curl Cameroon betasatellite (ALCCMB) and ageratum leaf curl Cameroon alphasatellite (ALCCMA) from Cameroon; tomato yellow leaf curl virus (TYLCV) from the Mediterranean Region. The infectivity assays were carried out in the model host species Nicotiana benthamiana and agro-infectious clones containing partial tandem repeats of the begomovirus and satellite genomes. The tested begomoviruses from different regions could functionally interact with non-cognate betasatellites and alphasatellite. Plants co-inoculated with CLCuKoV/CLCuGeB or CLCuMuV/CLCuGeB developed, for both combinations, more severe symptoms than with the begomovirus alone and the infection was verified by Southern blot hybridization. Nonetheless, CLCuKoV and CLCuMuV were shown also to support infection by ALCCMB, whereas OYCrV and TYLCV were able to support infection with CLCuMuB, ALCCMB and CLCuGeB. Moreover, all begomoviruses from different geographical origins supported ALCCMA from Africa. The results confirm that geographically diverse begomoviruses can functionally interact with non-cognate DNA-satellites, which may cause the emergence of new begomovirus-satellite complexes. Possibly, exchange of DNA-satellites may occur across continents leading to the emergence of new viral diseases.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNicotiana benthamiana 3aSouthern blotting 3aTomato yellow leaf curl virus 3aclones 3agenome 3ahosts 3aleaf curling 3amodels 3apathogenicity 3aprovenance 3asatellite DNA 3atandem repeat sequences 3aCameroon 3aMediterranean region 3aPakistan1 aLigthart, Maaike1 aKvarnheden, Anders0 tEuropean journal of plant pathology.g2019 Sept., v. 155, no. 1 p.111-124dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl51791x0929-18737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10658-019-01753-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03042naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100006100142245011600203300002000319500001900339520167100358592002802029650001602057650001002073650002002083650001302103650001202116650001202128650001502140650002202155700001902177700002202196700005802218700002102276700005602297700005702353773014902410856007602559852000902635655001202644IND60707342920221123021315.0200819e20200722xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070734292DNAL7 a10.1021/jacs.0c030112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShishido, Ryosuke1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5787-043210aGeneral Synthesis of Trialkyl- and Dialkylarylsilylboranes: Versatile Silicon Nucleophiles in Organic Synthesis  ap. 14125-14133.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aCompared to carbon-based nucleophiles, the number of silicon-based nucleophiles that is currently available remains limited, which significantly hampers the structural diversity of synthetically accessible silicon-based molecules. Given the high synthetic utility and ease of handling of carbon-based boron nucleophiles, silicon-based boron nucleophiles, i.e., silylboranes, have attracted considerable interest in recent years as nucleophilic silylation reagents that are activated by transition-metal catalysts or bases. However, the range of practically accessible silylboranes remains limited. In particular, the preparation of sterically hindered and functionalized silylboranes remains a significant challenge. Here, we report the use of rhodium and platinum catalysts for the direct borylation of hydrosilanes with bis(pinacolato)diboron, which allows the synthesis of new trialkylsilylboranes that bear bulky alkyl groups and functional groups as well as new dialkylarylsilylboranes that are difficult to synthesize via conventional methods using alkali metals. We further demonstrate that these compounds can be used as silicon nucleophiles in organic transformations, which significantly expands the scope of synthetically accessible organosilicon compounds compared to previously reported methods. Thus, the present study can be expected to inspire the development of efficient methods for novel silicon-containing bioactive molecules and organic materials with desirable properties. We also report the first ¹¹B{¹H} and ²⁹Si{¹H} NMR spectroscopic evidence for the formation of i-Pr₃SiLi generated by the reaction of i-Pr₃Si–B(pin) with MeLi.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLewis bases 3aboron 3aboron compounds 3aplatinum 3arhodium 3asilicon 3asilylation 3aspectral analysis1 aUesugi, Minami1 aTakahashi, Rikuro1 aMita, Tsuyoshi1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6655-34391 aIshiyama, Tatsuo1 aKubota, Koji1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1522-291X1 aItō, Hajime,1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3852-67210 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2020 July 22, v. 142, no. 33 p.14125-14133dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19166x1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jacs.0c030113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02496naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100006300154245008800217520135100305592002801656650001601684650001301700650001201713653002401725653002901749653001201778653001301790653002501803653003701828700006001865700001501925700001201940773009601952856008902048852000902137655001202146IND60752246920221119164634.0211129e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075224692DNAL7 a10.1016/j.landusepol.2021.1057792doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAdu-McVie, Rosemary1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5510-082410aClassifying innovation districts: Delphi validation of a multidimensional framework  aEstablishing innovation districts is a highly popular urban policy due to the economic, social and spatial benefits they offer to the host city. Investing on innovation districts is a risky business as there is no one-size-fit-all innovation district type. Besides, there only exists limited understanding on the varying features, functions and spatial and contextual characteristics of this new land use type. This study aims to contribute to the efforts in classifying innovation districts holistically through a multidimensional framework. The study builds on a conceptual framework developed by the authors and expands it into an operational framework that consists of numerous attributes—i.e., four dimensions (context, form, feature, function), 16 indicators and 48 measures. The framework and its attributes are subjected to validation by a panel of 32 experts through an international Delphi survey. This paper reports the process of framework development and validation. The resulting multidimensional innovation classification framework is first of its kind. It is useful in determining the key characteristics of existing innovation districts, helps in understanding what works in certain locations and what does not, and informs decisions of policymakers in investing the type of innovation districts suitable for the local context.  aPublisher supplied data 3aland policy 3aland use 3asurveys 0aInnovation district 0aClassification framework 0aFeature 0aFunction 0aSpace use and design 0aKnowledge and innovation economy1 aYigitcanlar, Tan1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7262-71181 aErol, Isil1 aXia, Bo0 tLand use policy.g2021 Dec., v. 111 p.105779-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12412x0264-83777nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.landusepol.2021.1057793Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03013naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002200148245009800170300001300268520170900281592002801990650005302018650001102071650001902082650001802101650001602119650001702135650001002152650001102162650001102173650001102184650001302195650000802208650001502216650001202231650002402243650001502267650001002282651001802292700002202310773014302332856008302475852000902558655001202567IND60648546120221118190609.0200217e201907  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064854612DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jneb.2019.05.5842doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTayie, Francis A.10aP208 Serum Markers of Fruits and Vegetables are Low in Low-Income Adults in the United States  ap. S126.  aPoverty alters food selection for calorie dense foods to the detriment of nutrient dense foods such as fruits and vegetables (FV).Serum carotenoids concentrations were analyzed to ascertain relationships with income level among the United States population.The phlebotomy sample of the United States National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2003-2004 was analyzed to study the relationship between income level and blood serum markers from FV. Data from 10,952 adults, comprising 5,478 men, and 5,474 women were analyzed for this study. Multivariable regression models were used to study the associations between income level, defined by the United States Bureau of the Census, and serum carotenoids concentration. Those categorized as low-income had income <130% of the federal poverty threshold, whereas those with income ≥130% of the federal poverty threshold were categorized as high-income.Compared to high-income adults, low-income adults had significantly lower serum concentration of α carotene (mean ± SE) (3.3 ± 0.1 vs 4.2 ± 0.7), β carotene (13.4 ± 0.3 vs 16.6 ± 0.2), lutein (8.8 ± 0.1vs 10.6 ± 0.1) and lycopene (19.4 ± 0.2 vs 21.7 ± 0.2) (all P < .001). Low-income adults were significantly more likely to have serum concentration that was below the median [Odds Ratio; 95% CI]: α-carotene (1.77; 1.41-2.25), β-carotene (1.62; 1.28-2.04), lutein (1.52; 1.12-2.17), and lycopene (1.42; 1.13-1.79), all P < .001.Being low-income associates with lower serum concentration, and possibly low consumption of carotenoid-rich foods such as FV. Food assistance for low-income adults should include options that improve consumption of carotenoid-rich foods such as FV.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNational Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 3aadults 3aalpha-carotene 3abeta-carotene 3ablood serum 3afood choices 3afoods 3afruits 3aincome 3alutein 3alycopene 3amen 3aodds ratio 3apoverty 3aregression analysis 3avegetables 3awomen 3aUnited States1 aBrewer, Gabrielle0 tJournal of nutrition education and behavior.g2019 July,  Aug., v. 51, no. 7 p.S126-S126dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl70490x1499-40467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jneb.2019.05.5843Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02855naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002400148245017600172300001600348520134500364592002801709650001101737650000801748650002701756650002201783650001901805650001001824650002101834650001201855650004301867650001701910650001901927650004301946650001501989650001802004650001002022700002302032700002802055700002202083700002002105700002102125773013502146856008202281961001302363852000902376655001202385IND60662399520221120200820.0190904e201909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066239952DNAL7 a10.1007/s10658-019-01755-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDrais, Mounira Inas10aDevelopment and validation of a loop-mediated isothermal amplification technique (LAMP) for the detection of Spiroplasma citri, the causal agent of citrus stubborn disease  ap. 125-134.  aCitrus stubborn disease (CSD) is caused by a Gram-positive bacterium, Spiroplasma citri, and is an endemic, but manageable, citrus disease. CSD-affected trees are low yielding but a key problem is that its symptoms are similar to and easily mistaken for Huanglongbing (HLB), a devastating citrus disease controlled by quarantine and eradication. Therefore, a rapid and simple test for S. citri is needed to readily distinguish CSD from HLB. To this end, a Loop-Mediated Isothermal Amplification technique (LAMP) was developed to detect S. citri, targeting the spiralin gene. The protocol was optimized for crude plant extracts from infected trees to allow on-site field testing. The LAMP assay showed high specificity to S. citri and detected DNA to a level of 100 fg/μl with no inhibition by crude plant extracts. Although the LAMP assay was 9 times less sensitive than qPCR with purified DNA templates, it performed well in field validations using a portable BioRanger device with citrus crude extracts. The LAMP assay showed detection efficiency and percentage yes/no calls similar to those obtained by real time PCR conducted with DNA extracted and purified from the same sample. The LAMP procedure allows growers, pest control or diagnostic services to rapidly test for S. citri in the field without a laboratory or DNA purification.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCitrus 3aDNA 3aGram-positive bacteria 3aSpiroplasma citri 3afruit diseases 3agenes 3agreening disease 3agrowers 3aloop-mediated isothermal amplification 3apest control 3aplant extracts 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3aquarantine 3atree diseases 3atrees1 aMaheshwari, Yogita1 aSelvaraj, Vijayanandraj1 aVarvaro, Leonardo1 aYokomi, Raymond1 aDjelouah, Khaled0 tEuropean journal of plant pathology.g2019 Sept., v. 155, no. 1 p.125-134dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl51791x0929-18737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10658-019-01755-63Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle02344naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245015400168300001800322520110300340592002801443650001801471650001501489650001701504650001501521650001301536650002301549650001501572650003101587700002501618700002201643700002501665700002101690700002401711700002201735700002501757773010701782856004801889852000901937655001201946IND50070022920221119223614.0131020e201312  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007002292DNAL7 a10.1007/s11947-012-0993-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPenci, María C.10aMatching Changes in Sensory Evaluation with Physical and Chemical Parameters : A Case Study: Argentinean Pistachio Nuts (Pistachia vera L. cv Kerman)  ap. 3305-3316.  aChanges in pistachio nuts induced by roasting and salting processes, evaluated by both sensory and instrumental analyses are reported, looking for a match in both methods. Dried (DP), roasted (RP), and salted–roasted pistachios (SRP) were studied, including four groups of sensory attributes, six basic chemical parameters, complemented by volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and breaking force. Multivariate statistics helped with data interpretation, enabling correlations between two groups of variables. Key results show that the perception of roasting is associated with increased amounts of α-pinene and 3-carene in RP and SRP, while DP are associated with higher amounts of limonene, moisture, and bitterness. Sensory and puncture test measurements (texturometer) showed opposite results, which could be explained considering the loss of plasticity in RP and SRP. Current results present a novel approach for the evaluation of changes in the perception of pistachio quality by consumers, supported by both sensory and instrumental analyses using multivariate statistics for data evaluation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPistacia vera 3abitterness 3acase studies 3apistachios 3aroasting 3asensory evaluation 3astatistics 3avolatile organic compounds1 aMartinez, Marcela L.1 aFabani, María P.1 aFeresin, Gabriela E.1 aTapia, Alejandro1 aIghani, Maximiliano1 aRibotta, Pablo D.1 aWunderlin, Daniel A.0 tFood and bioprocess technology.g2013 Dec., v. 6, no. 12 p.3305-3316dSpringer-Verlagx1935-51307nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11947-012-0993-4  aDNAL 7aarticle02868naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003500135040001800170100001400188245009000202300001200292506007600304520108800380592002801468596005501496596010501551506003701656650001501693650001301708650002401721650001801745650001601763650001001779650002301789650002101812650001501833650001801848650001401866650001501880650001001895650001901905650002401924651001001948700001601958700001801974700001701992700002002009700006202029700001502091773011702106856008202223852000902305655001202314IND60624628120221207045250.0210216e201812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062462812DNAL7 a305092552pmid7 aPMC62761462pmcid7 a10.1186/s12917-018-1712-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDong, Hui10aSarcocystis species in wild and domestic sheep (Ovis ammon and Ovis aries) from China  ap. 377.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Sarcocystis species are intracellular protozoan parasites that can pose a threat to animal health and food safety. The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence of infection with Sarcocystis infection in sheep from China. RESULTS: In total, 52.51% (335/638) of tissue samples from domestic sheep contained sarcocysts through examination by light microscopy. The organisms were identified as S. tenella and S. arieticanis by molecular assays. Macroscopic S. gigantea and S. medusiformis were not found. The average sarcocysts loading was 18.07 ± 29.87 per square centimeter in the myocardium of domestic sheep. Furthermore, two specimens of argali (Ovis ammon) were examined and sarcocysts were found in the myocardium of one animal. According to the sequence of the cox1 gene of sarcocysts from argali, it was speculated as S. tenella. CONCLUSIONS: We found a high prevalence and parasite load of Sarcocystis in sheep from both central and northwest China. This report is the first to indicate that argali may be a natural intermediate host for S. tenella.  aPublisher supplied data  a2016M600577cChina Postdoctoral Science Foundation  a17HASTIT038cProgram for Science and Technology Innovation Talents in Universities of Henan Province0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aOvis ammon 3aProtozoa 3aSarcocystis tenella 3aanimal health 3afood safety 3agenes 3aintermediate hosts 3alight microscopy 3amyocardium 3aparasite load 3aparasites 3asarcocysts 3asheep 3asheep diseases 3aveterinary medicine 3aChina1 aSu, Ruijing1 aWang, Yinghua1 aTong, Zongxi1 aZhang, Longxian1 aAtwill, Yurong Y.,1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8971-46481 aHu, Junjie0 tBMC veterinary research.g2018 Dec., v. 14, no. 1 p.377-377dBioMed CentralwJournal:jnl4152735x1746-61487nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12917-018-1712-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03178naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006000148245013600208300001500344520173400359592002802093650002202121650002502143650001802168650003002186650001902216650001402235650001502249650001302264650001302277650002002290650001502310650001502325650000902340650001202349650001602361650001202377650001602389700002102405700001702426700002002443700002002463773013402483856008202617852000902699655001202708IND60662399620221120200835.0190904e201909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066239962DNAL7 a10.1007/s10658-019-01752-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKaukoranta, Timo1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1251-907210aContrasting responses of T-2, HT-2 and DON mycotoxins and Fusarium species in oat to climate, weather, tillage and cereal intensity  ap. 93-110.  aAnalysis of survey data from 804 spring-oat fields divided into five climatic regions suggested that low inoculum level of Fusarium langsethiae was a major limiter of T-2 + HT-2. A 30-year climate with a cool and rainy 10-day period preceding estimated mid-anthesis and a warm 3-week period following anthesis were positively associated with T-2 + HT-2 contamination. In 12 survey years, warm weather from 4 weeks before GS65 until harvesting increased T-2 + HT-2, except in the 1–2 weeks preceding mid-anthesis, when the requirement for high humidity dominated. F. langsethiae and F. sporotrichioides were consistently promoted by high temperature from mid-anthesis onwards. A positive response of T-2 + HT-2 to high humidity peaked 5–10 days earlier and was shorter and weaker than the responses of DON and F. graminearum. The probability of high concentration and regional mean concentration of T-2 + HT-2 tended to be lower under ploughing than under non-ploughing, and they tended to increase with increasing cereal intensity. T-2 + HT-2 was positively associated with zero tillage when compared with minimum tillage. The responses of F. langsethiae and F. sporotrichioides to ploughing and cereal intensity varied by region. In contrast to T-2 + HT-2, DON was the same or higher under ploughing than under non-ploughing, not consistently affected by cereal intensity and not associated with zero tillage. F. graminearum was consistently more common under ploughing than under non-ploughing, and decreased with increasing cereal intensity in four regions. Also, F. culmorum and F. poae tended to be more common under ploughing. F. culmorum increased with cereal intensity in three regions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFusarium culmorum 3aFusarium graminearum 3aFusarium poae 3aFusarium sporotrichioides 3aclimatic zones 3aflowering 3aharvesting 3ahumidity 3ainoculum 3aminimum tillage 3amycotoxins 3ano-tillage 3aoats 3aplowing 3aprobability 3asurveys 3atemperature1 aHietaniemi, Veli1 aRämö, Sari1 aKoivisto, Tauno1 aParikka, Päivi0 tEuropean journal of plant pathology.g2019 Sept., v. 155, no. 1 p.93-110dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl51791x0929-18737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10658-019-01752-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04112naa a2200637 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004300111040001800154100002200172245015900194300001600353520206700369592002802436650002102464650002602485650002202511650002802533650001202561650001202573650001002585650001902595650001202614650001802626650002802644650000902672650001702681650001202698650001602710650001802726650001902744650001302763650002402776650002402800650001202824650004802836650002802884650002802912650002202940650004902962650004703011650003303058650001203091650002303103650005203126651001303178651001303191700001703204700002503221773011803246856008903364852000903453655001203462IND4468352520221123040003.0141111e20111202xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446835252DNAL7 a219446622pmid7 a10.1016/j.ijfoodmicro.2011.08.0282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMhone, Tryness A.10aAerobic bacterial, coliform, Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus counts of raw and processed milk from selected smallholder dairy farms of Zimbabwe  ap. 223-228.  aA cross sectional study was conducted to enumerate total viable bacteria (TBC), coliforms, Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus in raw (n=120) and processed (n=20) milk from individual farms from three smallholder dairy schemes of Zimbabwe between October, 2009 and February, 2010. Data on management factors were collected using a structured questionnaire. A standard pour plate technique was used to enumerate total viable bacteria, while for coliforms, E. coli and S. aureus, counts were assessed by the spread plate technique. The association of total viable bacterial counts and management factors was assessed using univariable and a linear regression model. The log₁₀ TBC for raw milk differed significantly (P<0.05) amongst the schemes with the lowest (5.6±4.7log₁₀ cfu/ml) and highest (6.7±5.8log₁₀ cfu/ml) recorded from Marirangwe and Nharira respectively. The mean log₁₀ of TBC of processed milk (6.6±6.0log₁₀ cfu/ml) were marginally higher than those of raw milk (6.4±5.6log₁₀ cfu/ml) but not significant (P>0.05). The coliform, E. coli and S. aureus counts for raw milk significantly differed (P<0.05) amongst the study areas. The variation in TBC, coliforms, E. coli and S. aureus counts amongst the schemes could be attributed to differences in milking hygiene where farms with more access to training and monitoring of microbiological quality of milk had lower counts. Linear regression analysis revealed dairy scheme, delivery time and season of milking as independently associated with increased TBC of raw milk. The high TBC of raw and processed milk generally indicated low levels of milking hygienic practices, and high level of post-processing contamination, respectively. The high TBC, coliform, E. coli and S. aureus counts of both raw and processed milk may present a public health hazard. Thus, educating the farmers on general hygienic practices, quickening the delivery of milk to collection centres, or availing cooling facilities on-farm will improve the microbiological quality and safety of milk.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aStaphylococcus aureus 3acoliform bacteria 3across-sectional studies 3adairies 3afarmers 3afarms 3ahealth hazards 3ahygiene 3alinear models 3amicrobiological quality 3amilk 3amilk quality 3amilking 3aplate count 3apublic health 3aquestionnaires 3araw milk 3aregression analysis 3asmall-scale farming 2aAnimals 2aBacteria, Aerobicxisolation & purification 2aColony Count, Microbial 2aCross-Sectional Studies 2aDairyingxmethods 2aEnterobacteriaceaexisolation & purification 2aEscherichia colixisolation & purification 2aFood Contaminationxanalysis 2aHygiene 2aMilkxmicrobiology 2aStaphylococcus aureusxisolation & purification 3aZimbabwe 0aZimbabwe1 aMatope, Gift1 aSaidi, Petronella T.0 tInternational journal of food microbiology.g2011 Dec. 2, v. 151, no. 2 p.223-228dElsevier B.V.x0168-16057nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijfoodmicro.2011.08.0283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03003naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002500092040001800117100002400135245007400159300001600233500002000249520186200269592002802131650001102159650001502170650001602185650001502201650002102216650001402237650001102251650001602262650001402278650001702292650002302309650002402332650001402356650001402370650000902384651001202393773009602405852000902501856007102510655001202581IND4371239020221120155238.0170626e200404  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437123902DNAL7 a10.1890/02-05762doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWebster, Michael S.10aDensity dependence via intercohort competition in a coral‐reef fish  ap. 986-994.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aDemographic density dependence is essential for regulating population dynamics. For populations with multiple age or size cohorts, interactions between cohorts may be an important source of density dependence. Between‐cohort interactions may be especially intense for many marine fish populations because of the potential disparity in competitive ability between small new recruits and relatively large resident conspecifics. Indeed, for marine fishes, density dependence in local populations appears to be widespread, particularly during a crucial time period following settlement of larvae into juvenile and adult habitats. I tested whether the demography of newly settled juveniles of the planktivorous fairy basslet (Gramma loreto) was affected by the density of adult conspecifics. Using spatially isolated local populations on coral reefs in the Bahamas, I experimentally transplanted a cohort of juveniles to local populations with three treatments of adult density: adults absent, average adult density, and high adult density (twice average). By following the fate of the transplanted juveniles, I determined that juvenile mortality increased as a function of adult density. Juveniles did not experience significantly higher rates of aggression or lower growth at higher densities of adults. However, in the presence of adults, juveniles generally fed at the back of aggregations, where feeding rates tend to be lower. Automated time‐lapse video revealed that predators were found most frequently toward the back of aggregations. Thus competition with adults for prime feeding positions may increase predation risk for juveniles by forcing them to overlap spatially with predators. Consequently, interactions between juveniles and adults could influence the demography of subsequent generations in ways that promote local population regulation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadults 3aaggression 3acoral reefs 3ademography 3afish communities 3ajuveniles 3alarvae 3amarine fish 3amortality 3aplanktivores 3apopulation density 3apopulation dynamics 3apredation 3apredators 3arisk 3aBahamas0 tEcology.g2004 Apr., v. 85, no. 4 p.986-994dEcological Society of Americax0012-96587nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1890/02-05763Available from publisher's site 7aarticle03458naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002500150245017300175300001600348506010400364506007600468506011700544520162400661592002802285506003702313650001702350650002302367650001602390650002402406650002102430650001702451650001102468650001702479650001502496653001402511653001102525653001302536653001402549653001202563653002602575653000902601653002302610700002302633700002202656700003202678700001802710700001302728773009302741856008502834852000902919655001202928IND60772525220221207073535.0220421s2022    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077252522DNAL7 a10.1016/j.toxrep.2022.03.0402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLim, Sharoen Yu Ming10aIn vitro and In silico studies of interactions of cathinone with human recombinant cytochrome P450 CYP(1A2), CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C19, CYP2E1, CYP2J2, and CYP3A5  ap. 759-768.  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/  aCathinone is the psychostimulatory major active ingredient of khat (Catha edulis Forsk) and are often co-abused with alcohols and polydrugs. With the increased consumption of khat and cathinones on a global scale, efforts should be channelled into understanding and minimising the excruciating effects of possible khat-drug interactions. This study aimed to determine the in vitro inhibitory effects of cathinone on CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C19, CYP2E1, CYP2J2 and CYP3A5 and the in silico identification of their type of interactions and residues involved. The activities of CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C19, CYP2E1, CYP2J2 and CYP3A5 were examined by fluorescence based assays using recombinant cDNA-expressed human CYPs in Vivid® P450 screening kits. Cathinone reversibly inhibited CYP1A2, CYP2A6 and CYP3A5 via competitive, uncompetitive and noncompetitive modes with inhibition constant (Kᵢ) values of 57.12, 13.75 and 23.57 µM respectively. Cathinone showed negligible inhibitory effects on CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C19, CYP2E1 and CYP2J2. Cathinone showed negligible time dependent inhibition on all 8 CYPs. Docking studies was performed on cathinone with CYP1A2, CYP2A6 and CYP3A5 following their inhibition in vitro. Cathinone is bound to a few key amino acid residues in the active sites while π-π interactions are formed in aromatic clusters of CYP1A2 and CYP3A5. These findings offer valuable reference for the use of cathinones and khat when combined with therapeutic drugs that are metabolised by CYP enzymes especially patients on medications metabolised by CYP1A2, CYP2A6 and CYP3A5.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aCatha edulis 3aactive ingredients 3aamino acids 3acomputer simulation 3acytochrome P-450 3afluorescence 3ahumans 3atherapeutics 3atoxicology 0aCathinone 0aCYP450 0ain vitro 0ain silico 0aDocking 0aHerb-drug interaction 0aKhat 0aCatha edulis Forsk1 aLoo, Jason Siau Ee1 aAlshagga, Mustafa1 aAlshawsh, Mohammed Abdullah1 aOng, Chin Eng1 aPan, Yan0 tToxicology reports.g2022, v. 9 p.759-768dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23254x2214-75007nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.toxrep.2022.03.0403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02821naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245011200166300001600278520164100294592002801935650001401963650002201977650001801999650001302017650001602030650002602046650001202072650001602084650002102100650001202121700003102133700002202164700003102186700001802217773010902235856008202344852000902426655001202435IND60120156220221120071951.0181002e201502  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012015622DNAL7 a10.1007/s10570-014-0500-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEsmaeili, Nima10aMechanical properties for bio-based thermoset composites made from lactic acid, glycerol and viscose fibers  ap. 603-613.  aRegenerated cellulose fibers were used to produce thermoset composites from a bio-based thermoset resin synthesized from lactic acid and glycerol. The resin was impregnated into the regenerated cellulose fiber and compression molded at elevated temperature to produce thermoset composites. Different fiber alignments (unidirectional and bidirectional), different reinforcement type (warp-knitted and non-woven) and varying fiber loading (65, 70 and 75 wt%) were investigated. The composites were characterized by flexural, tensile and Charpy impact testing and by dynamical mechanical thermal analysis. Water uptake and ageing properties in climate chamber were also characterized for the composites. The results showed that the composites had good mechanical properties. They can be produced with up to 70 wt% fiber content when using unidirectional (UD) and bidirectional fiber (BD) alignment, and with up to 65 wt% fiber content when using the non-woven (NW) reinforcement. The tensile modulus ranged between 11 and 14 GPa for UD composites, 7 and 8.5 GPa for BD composites and 5 and 7.5 GPa for NW composites. The flexural modulus ranged between 10 and 11.5 GPa for UD composites, 5 and 6.5 GPa for BD composites and 5 and 6 GPa for NW composites. The impact strength ranged between 130 and 150 kJ/m² for UD composites, 98 and 110 kJ/m² for BD composites and 17 and 20 kJ/m² for NW composites. The result of the ageing test showed that the mechanical properties of the composites deteriorate with ageing but the addition of styrene somewhat counteracts the degradation, making the composite applicable for indoor use.  aPublisher supplied data 3acellulose 3acellulosic fibers 3afiber content 3aglycerol 3alactic acid 3amechanical properties 3astyrene 3atemperature 3athermal analysis 3aviscose1 aBakare, Fatimat Oluwatoyin1 aSkrifvars, Mikael1 aJavanshir Afshar, Shahrzad1 aÅkesson, Dan0 tCellulose.g2015 Feb., v. 22, no. 1 p.603-613dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl3871471x0969-02397nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10570-014-0500-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01964naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100003200150245011100182300001600293520081400309592002801123650002401151650002301175650002501198650001201223653002301235653002101258653003601279653003001315653002601345653002901371700002101400773009901421856008501520852000901605655001201614IND60584075420221118075938.0190416e201802  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058407542DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecoser.2017.08.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVarga Pastor, Aitana de la,10aInnovative legal tools applied in land stewardship for the conservation of ecosystem services in Catalonia  ap. 395-403.  aIn this paper we analyse how the conservation of ecosystem services (ES) is integrated in Spanish and Catalan legislation on land stewardship. Analysing their implementation in Catalonia, we demonstrate that the legal land stewardship framework has innovative tools that can be supplemented by payments for ecosystem services (PES) and tax incentives toward comprehensive ES protection. By analysing several experiences in Catalonia currently under development, we verify that implementing all of these instruments and encouraging the involvement of public administrations and civil society as a whole is crucial to conserving ES. Overall, we demonstrate the importance of incorporating into law not only ES but also measures available for protecting them and the alternative instruments used to develop them.  aPublisher supplied data 3aeconomic incentives 3aecosystem services 3alaws and regulations 3asociety 0aEcosystem services 0aLand stewardship 0aPayments for ecosystem services 0aEnvironmental legislation 0aMillennium Objectives 0aEnvironmental protection1 aPons Solé, Joan0 tEcosystem services.g2018 Feb., v. 29 p.395-403dElsevier B.V.wJournal:21609x2212-04167nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoser.2017.08.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02930naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100006500150245007900215300001600294520150900310592002801819650001901847650002501866650002301891650002901914650001201943650001101955650002201966650001801988650001902006650001102025653002102036653002902057653001902086653003002105653002902135653001902164700002302183700002602206700006202232773009602294856008502390852000902475655001202484IND60619711620221122143013.0200712e201809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061971162DNAL7 a10.1016/j.wasman.2018.07.0502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBartolacci, Francesca1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0773-595010aAssessing factors that influence waste management financial sustainability  ap. 571-579.  aThis article examines the financial sustainability of waste management activities to understand whether and how choices oriented toward environmental protection and contextual factors influence waste management companies’ revenues and costs, which, in turn, affect their financial sustainability and, thus, their ongoing viability.To achieve this purpose, a three-year empirical analysis on 880 Italian municipalities was conducted. Financial sustainability was evaluated with reference to waste management companies working in these territories, and a set of quantitative and qualitative data was considered to investigate possible influencing factors.The results show that separate waste collection may positively influence companies’ financial performance, while municipalities’ territorial extension negatively impacts profitability. Lastly, there is no evidence of a relationship between companies’ financial sustainability and the potential presence of waste disposal plants or the geographical areas in which they operate. For the analyzed companies, thus, it seems that it would be more convenient to expand business by boosting separate waste collection activities than by enlarging the territories served.These findings can support firms’ decisions regarding environmental and financial issues, both of which are crucial for long-term sustainability. It can also help policy makers detect appropriate tools to support companies in implementing European Union waste management targets.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEuropean Union 3abusiness enterprises 3aempirical research 3aenvironmental protection 3afinance 3aincome 3aissues and policy 3aprofitability 3awaste disposal 3awastes 0aWaste management 0aFinancial sustainability 0aMunicipalities 0aSeparate waste collection 0aEnvironmental protection 0aPanel analysis1 aPaolini, Antonella1 aQuaranta, Anna Grazia1 aSoverchia, Michela1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7558-37950 tWaste management.g2018 Sept., v. 79 p.571-579dElsevier LtdwJournal:6325x0956-053X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2018.07.0503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02775naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002100148245009300169300001300262520171500275592002801990650002502018650001102043650002102054650001502075650001402090650001202104650002202116650001302138650001502151650001102166650001302177773014302190856008302333852000902416655001202425IND60648546320221118190225.0200217e201907  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064854632DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jneb.2019.05.5862doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCrosier, Michael10aP210 Effect of Class Length and Frequency on Learning in an Upper-Level Nutrition Course  ap. S127.  aDebate exists on the merits of twice-per-week classes versus classes that meet more frequently for a shorter length of time. The effect of class length and frequency on student achievement in the college setting is unknown.Assess if class length and frequency affect learning in an upper-level nutrition class.From Fall 2014 through Fall 2017, a total of 251 undergraduate and graduate students (91% female) took an upper-level metabolism course offered at Framingham State University as part of the dietetics curriculum. One hundred and fifty-nine (63%) took the class twice-per-week in a one hour 40 minute time block, while 92 (37%) took the class in a shorter, more frequent time block (50 minutes, four days per week).Independent T-tests were used to assess the difference in final grades between the two time blocks. Statistical analysis was conducted using IBM SPSS Statistics version 24.There was no difference in final grade between groups [twice-per-week mean final grade 81 vs. four days per week mean final grade 83 (P = .254)]. Of the 251 students, 194 were undergraduate and 57 were graduate students. Overall, there was a significant difference in final grade between the graduate vs. undergraduate students (87 vs. 81; P < .001). However, when compared by class schedule, there was no significant difference in final grades for graduates or undergraduates.This research suggest class length and frequency do not play a major role in student success in an upper-level dietetics course. While there may be advantages to either class schedule based on individual instructor pedagogical style, one class schedule does not appear to enhance student achievement, as measured by final grades.None.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacademic achievement 3aautumn 3acollege students 3acurriculum 3adietetics 3afemales 3agraduate students 3alearning 3ametabolism 3at-test 3ateachers0 tJournal of nutrition education and behavior.g2019 July,  Aug., v. 51, no. 7 p.S127-S127dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl70490x1499-40467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jneb.2019.05.5863Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03867naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001700139245014500156300001600301520205900317592002802376650002202404650001502426650002002441650001302461650003802474650001802512650001002530650001602540650002802556650002002584650001102604650001302615650002102628650003102649650001302680650003302693650001102726650001302737650002102750650003702771653002202808653001302830653001802843653002202861653003002883653001502913700001702928700002002945700001502965700001902980700001302999700001903012700001703031773012103048856007503169852000903244655001203253IND60527433620221120230718.0160715e20130109xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052743362DNAL7 a10.1021/am302246s2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSun, Lizhang10aNovel Chitosan-Functionalized Spherical Nanosilica Matrix As an Oral Sustained Drug Delivery System for Poorly Water-Soluble Drug Carvedilol  ap. 103-113.  aA novel spherical nanosilica matrix (SNM) together with chitosan (CTS) encapsulated SNM (CTS-SNM) was developed in order to investigate the feasibility of using chitosan to regulate drug release rate from porous silica and obtain an oral sustained drug delivery system. To achieve this goal, we synthesized a spherical nanosilica matrix (SNM) and incorporated chitosan chains on the SNM surface. Solvent evaporation method was adopted to load the model drug carvedilol into SNM and CTS-SNM. The physicochemical properties of the drug carriers and drug-loaded composites were systematically studied using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), nitrogen adsorption, X-ray diffraction (XRD), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The structural changes in CTS-SNM in simulated gastrointestinal fluid as well as the relationships between swelling effect of chitosan and in vitro drug release behaviors were investigated. Pharmacokinetic and bioavailability aspects were also discussed. The results showed that the powerful dispersing effect of SNM and the blocking action due to the swelling of chitosan were the two main factors contributing to the sustained drug release behavior. The swelling effect of chitosan in an acidic environment together with the shrinking effect in a relatively alkaline environment allowed regulation of drug release behavior in simulated gastrointestinal fluid. An in vivo study showed that the bioavailability of CAR was improved 182% compared with that of the commercial capsule when SNM was used as the drug carrier. As for CAR-CTS-SNM, the Tₘₐₓ of CAR was delayed by about 3.4 h and the bioavailability was slightly increased in comparison with the commercial capsule. We believe that SNM and CTS-SNM developed in this study will help increase the use of polymers and inorganic materials in pharmaceutical applications and stimulate the design of oral drug delivery systems for immediate or sustained release of poorly water-soluble drugs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3aadsorption 3abioavailability 3achitosan 3adifferential scanning calorimetry 3adrug carriers 3adrugs 3aevaporation 3agastrointestinal system 3ain vivo studies 3amodels 3anitrogen 3apharmacokinetics 3aphysicochemical properties 3apolymers 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asilica 3asolvents 3athermogravimetry 3atransmission electron microscopy 0ananosilica matrix 0achitosan 0adrug delivery 0asustained release 0apoorly water-soluble drug 0acarvedilol1 aWang, Yanzhu1 aJiang, Tongying1 aZheng, Xin1 aZhang, Jinghai1 aSun, Jin1 aSun, Changshan1 aWang, Siling0 tACS Applied Materials & Interfaces.g2013 Jan. 09, v. 5, no. 1 p.103-113dAmerican Chemical Societyx1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fam302246s3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04109naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001600143245012700159300001800286520258000304592002802884650001302912650001102925650001302936650001602949650000902965650001702974650001002991650001203001650001003013650001903023650000903042650001503051650001203066650001403078650001503092650002303107650001103130651001603141653002203157653001803179653002303197653001903220700001803239700001803257700001603275700001803291700001703309773015403326856007803480852000903558655001203567IND60539592420221121002126.0190318e201509  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053959242DNAL7 a10.3168/jds.2014-89482doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDavis, S.R.10aLactation traits associated with short- and long-term once-daily milking performance in New Zealand crossbred dairy cattle  ap. 6094-6107.  aThe main objectives of this study were to establish the relative value of milk yields under twice-daily milking (TDM) as a predictor of yield and yield loss under once-daily milking (ODM), and to understand the role of residual milk and udder storage capacity-related traits in regulating yield and yield loss during ODM. A Holstein-Friesian × Jersey crossbred herd was established over 2 seasons (years), as 2 individual cohorts on the same farm, managed on a pasture-based system over 4 lactations. Short-term (1-wk) ODM studies, with a starting total of 690 cows, were undertaken in mid- and late-lactation in lactation 2 and in mid-lactation in lactation 3 for each cohort. A 10-wk study of ODM performance began in mid-lactation in lactation 3, whereas lactation 4 was a full-lactation assessment of ODM. In the short-term studies, milk yield under ODM was well predicted (R2=0.7 to 0.8 in 5 of 6 studies) by the daily yield under TDM in the week before ODM. Yield loss (kg/d) increased with increasing milk yield and with increasing somatic cell count (SCC), although predictions were relatively poor (R2=0.09 to 0.30). Yield loss (%) decreased with increasing TDM yield in 3 of the 6 studies and was positively correlated with SCC during ODM. Nevertheless, ODM yield loss, in absolute or percentage terms, was a poorly repeatable trait in grazing cows. Part of the variation in yield loss percentage (30%) was positively associated with residual milk (%), measured pretrial, during measurement of functional udder capacity in lactation 3. Total production (kg of milk) over the full-lactation ODM study in lactation 4 was correlated with total production in the 10-wk trial in lactation 3 (r=0.72 and 0.63 for cohorts 1 and 2, respectively). Identifying the highest- and lowest-producing 10% of animals during the full lactation of ODM indicated that poor production was associated with high yields of residual milk (measured in lactation 3) and, conversely, high production was associated with low yields of residual milk, relative to the other 80% of animals. These same “high” and “low” production groups from lactation 4 had similar differences in performance in the earlier short-term studies and a larger or smaller percentage yield loss associated with the residual milk measurement. Breeding strategies for ODM may benefit, therefore, from greater emphasis on selecting for a low residual milk fraction to optimize milking performance. Nevertheless, the level of milk production under TDM is a strong phenotypic predictor of milk production under ODM.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHolstein 3aJersey 3abreeding 3acorrelation 3acows 3adairy cattle 3afarms 3agrazing 3aherds 3alate lactation 3amilk 3amilk yield 3amilking 3aphenotype 3aprediction 3asomatic cell count 3audders 3aNew Zealand 0amilking frequency 0aresidual milk 0aonce-daily milking 0audder capacity1 aTurner, S.-A.1 aObolonkin, V.1 aTiplady, K.1 aSpelman, R.J.1 aPhyn, C.V.C.0 tJournal of dairy science.g2015 Sept., v. 98, no. 9 p.6094-6107dElsevier Inc.aAmerican Dairy Science AssociationwJournal:jnl45500x0022-03027nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3168/jds.2014-89483Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01630naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002400094040001800118100002500136245006900161300001600230520063500246592002800881650001300909650000900922650001400931650002600945650001600971650001200987650001200999650001001011650001001021650001201031651001301043700002601056773010501082856007201187852000901259655001201268IND60131438420221120053941.0151127e200306  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013143842DNAL7 a10.1676/02-1402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLONDOÑO, GUSTAVO A.14aTHE nest and eggs of the cinereous mourner (laniocera hypopyrra)  ap. 115-118.  aWe present the first account of nesting biology for the Neotropical suboscine genus Laniocera by describing the nest and eggs of the Cinereous Mourner (L. hypopyrra) based on observations made in the Peruvian Amazon during 2001.

A monoethanolamine (MEA) based CO₂ capture system (CCSy) is a promising solution to separate CO₂ from the flue gases, but it can lead to a loss in utility generation by the UtSy, because of utility requirements for recovering the MEA solvent. A technoeconomic feasibility study to deploy CCSy at an existing UtSy as an integrated process should be performed for chemical plants. Thus, we design three process integration configurations to combine the UtSy and CCSy and then develop each process optimization model. Lastly, our technoeconomic analysis determines the one among three configurations that minimizes the total cost of configurations.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon dioxide 3aelectricity 3aengineering 3aethanolamine 3afeasibility studies 3aflue gas 3amanufacturing 3amodels 3asolvents 3asteam 3autilities1 aHan, Jee-Hoon1 aLee, In-Beum0 tIndustrial & Engineering Chemistry Research.g2013 Dec. 26, v. 52, no. 51 p.18334-18344dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-50457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fie40280443Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03212naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002600148245008600174300001600260520162400276592002801900596005701928596007501985596008502060650001502145650002602160650002002186650001202206650002402218650001502242650001002257650002602267650001502293650001702308650001802325650001302343650002102356650001802377700002102395700002202416700002102438700006402459773012702523856008302650852000902733655001202742IND60701696120221120232154.0220906e202007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070169612DNAL7 a10.1007/s10533-020-00672-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEberwein, Jennifer R.10aLarge nitrogen oxide emission pulses from desert soils and associated microbiomes  ap. 239-250.  aNitrogen (N) trace gas emission pulses produced after wetting dry soils may be important pathways of ecosystem N loss. However, the rates and mechanisms controlling these emissions remain unclear. We tested whether changes in microbial community structure and increased rates of atmospheric N deposition could explain N emissions at two desert sites differing in atmospheric N deposition by ~ six fold. We measured peak NOₓ (sum of nitric oxide and nitrogen dioxide) emissions 12 h post-wetting. NOₓ emissions remained elevated over 24 h and increased after adding N. In contrast, we measured the highest nitrous oxide (N₂O) emissions within only 15 min post-wetting. N₂O emissions decreased within 12 h, were insensitive to adding N, and were among the highest reported globally. Microbial communities at the high N deposition site were less diverse with higher 16S nitrifier and bacterial amoA gene abundances relative to the low N deposition site, suggesting an increased capacity for nitrification. Nevertheless, N emissions were lower at the high N deposition site. While microbial communities changed after wetting, these changes were not correlated with N emissions. We conclude that desert soils can produce substantial NOₓ and N₂O emission pulses, but that these emissions do not appear directly governed by changing microbial community characteristics or higher atmospheric N inputs. These findings highlight the importance of gaseous N loss pathways from dryland ecosystems that may contribute to sustained N limitation, with implications for atmospheric chemistry and Earth’s climate.  aPublisher supplied data  aDEB 1405525 and 1656062cNational Science Foundation  aSTAR Graduate Student FellowshipcU.S. Environmental Protection Agency  aCA-R-PPA-5101-CG and CA-R-PPA-5093-HcNational Institute of Food and Agriculture 3aarid lands 3aatmospheric chemistry 3abiogeochemistry 3aclimate 3acommunity structure 3aecosystems 3agenes 3amicrobial communities 3amicrobiome 3anitric oxide 3anitrification 3anitrogen 3anitrogen dioxide 3anitrous oxide1 aHomyak, Peter M.1 aCarey, Chelsea J.1 aAronson, Emma L.1 aJenerette, G.

However, the information on the nutritional quality of these three populations of crabs is still scarce. Thus, we investigated and compared the tissue indices, total edible yield, proximate composition, fatty acid compositions and amino acid contents of these wild crab populations. We showed that: (1) TM population had the highest meat yield among the three populations; (2) TM recorded the highest moisture and the lowest total lipid content in ovary and muscle; (3) a higher level of total n-3 poly-unsaturated fatty acids was found in TM, except for the ovary in SF; (4) the three populations had similar essential amino acids scores. In conclusion, Eriocheir s.s. from these three populations all showed a high nutritional quality suitable for humans, especially the TM, which contains more eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEriocheir 3acrabs 3adocosahexaenoic acid 3aeicosapentaenoic acid 3afemales 3alipid content 3ameat 3amuscles 3anutritive value 3aproximate composition 3arivers 3aChina 0aEriocheir sensu stricto 0aedible yield 0anutritional quality 0afatty acids 0aamino acids1 aJiang, Xiaodong1 aZu, Lu1 aZhou, Wenquan1 aLuo, Min1 aCheng, Yongxu1 aWu, Xugan0 tCrustaceana.g, v. 94, no. 3 p.309-324dBrillwJournal:21399x0011-216X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1163/15685403-bja100943Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02802naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001600152245019900168300001800367520131200385592002801697650001201725650002101737650002501758650002701783650001901810650001801829650002201847650001101869650002001880650001301900650001701913653001901930653002701949653001901976653003101995653002502026700001302051700001502064700001602079700001602095773013702111856008702248852000902335655001202344IND60676126520221120231105.0200523e20200715xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067612652DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2019.11.0742doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShao, Lijun10aDecolorization affects the structural characteristics and antioxidant activity of polysaccharides from Thesium chinense Turcz: Comparison of activated carbon and hydrogen peroxide decolorization  ap. 1084-1091.  aDifferent decolorization methods have different effects on the properties of polysaccharides. In this study, polysaccharides extracted from Thesium chinense Turcz (T. chinense) were decolorized using either hydrogen peroxide (H₂O₂), which has been previously reported, or activated carbon. To begin, the conditions for decolorization by activated carbon were optimized through single factor experiments and orthogonal modeling and were predicted to be best at 0.5% (w/w) activated carbon, pH 5.0 and 40 °C in a water bath for 60 min. Following treatment by the two methods, the structures of the decolorized polysaccharides were compared. The samples treated by activated carbon (CTP) had higher molecular weight (Mw: 3.064 × 10⁵ g/mol) and more sulfate groups (14.33%, w/w), whereas the samples treated by H₂O₂ (HTP) had lower Mw (8.349 × 10⁴ g/mol) and more uronic acid (35.02%, w/w). The antioxidant capacities of the two samples were analyzed by free radical scavenging (DPPH, hydroxyl and ABTS) and cell antioxidant activity (CAA). The HTP showed a better scavenging effect on free radicals and a higher CAA. Together, the results showed that various decolorization methods differentially influence the characteristics of the polysaccharides extracted from T. chinense.  aPublisher supplied data 3aThesium 3aactivated carbon 3aantioxidant activity 3acarbohydrate structure 3adecolorization 3afree radicals 3ahydrogen peroxide 3amodels 3apolysaccharides 3asulfates 3auronic acids 0aPolysaccharide 0aThesium chinense Turcz 0aDecolorization 0aStructural characteristics 0aAntioxidant activity1 aSun, Yue1 aLiang, Jin1 aLi, Meiqing1 aLi, Xueling0 tInternational journal of biological macromolecules.g2020 July 15, v. 155 p.1084-1091dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12340x0141-81307nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2019.11.0743Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02991naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001400139245009600153300002000249520170000269592002801969650002701997650002502024650001902049650002002068650001002088650001902098650002102117650002602138650002202164650001702186650001302203650001802216650001102234650002002245651001802265700001902283700002502302700001802327773012802345856007502473852000902548655001202557IND60534929620221123033920.0160803e20140916xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053492962DNAL7 a10.1021/es501912d2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Hui10aIsotopic Fractionation by a Fungal P450 Nitric Oxide Reductase during the Production of N2O  ap. 10707-10715.  aNitrous oxide (N₂O) is a potent greenhouse gas with a 100-year global warming potential approximately 300 times that of CO₂. Because microbes account for over 75% of the N₂O released in the U.S., understanding the biochemical processes by which N₂O is produced is critical to our efforts to mitigate climate change. In the current study, we used gas chromatography–isotope ratio mass spectrometry (GC–IRMS) to measure the δ¹⁵N, δ¹⁸O, δ¹⁵Nᵅ, and δ¹⁵Nᵝ of N₂O generated by purified fungal nitric oxide reductase (P450nor) from Histoplasma capsulatum. The isotope values were used to calculate site preference (SP) values (difference in δ¹⁵N between the central (α) and terminal (β) N atoms in N₂O), enrichment factors (ε), and kinetic isotope effects (KIEs). Both oxygen and Nᵅ displayed normal isotope effects during enzymatic NO reduction with ε values of −25.7‰ (KIE = 1.0264) and −12.6‰ (KIE = 1.0127), respectively. However, bulk nitrogen (average δ¹⁵N of Nᵅ and Nᵝ) and Nᵝ exhibited inverse isotope effects with ε values of 14.0‰ (KIE = 0.9862) and 36.1‰ (KIE = 0.9651), respectively. The observed inverse isotope effect in δ¹⁵Nᵝ is consistent with reversible binding of the first NO in the P450nor reaction mechanism. In contrast to the constant SP observed during NO reduction in microbial cultures, the site preference measured for purified H. capsulatum P450nor was not constant, increasing from ∼15‰ to ∼29‰ during the course of the reaction. This indicates that SP for microbial cultures can vary depending on the growth conditions, which may complicate source tracing during microbial denitrification.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHistoplasma capsulatum 3abiochemical pathways 3acarbon dioxide 3adenitrification 3afungi 3aglobal warming 3agreenhouse gases 3aisotope fractionation 3amass spectrometry 3anitric oxide 3anitrogen 3anitrous oxide 3aoxygen 3astable isotopes 3aUnited States1 aGandhi, Hasand1 aOstrom, Nathaniel E.1 aHegg, Eric L.0 tEnvironmental Science & Technology.g2014 Sept. 16, v. 48, no. 18 p.10707-10715dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fes501912d3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02830naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100003000139245008500169300002000254520155500274592002801829650003001857650002101887650002601908650002601934650002701960650001301987650001702000650001502017650002102032650001002053650002102063650001602084650001402100650002102114650001202135650001402147700001802161700002002179773011302199856007502312852000902387655001202396IND60529876120221120072548.0160720e20141021xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052987612DNAL7 a10.1021/ac502554s2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChotinantakul, Kamonnaree10aAdvanced Amperometric Respiration Assay for Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing  ap. 10315-10322.  aA ferricyanide-based electrochemical cell respiration assay was adapted for use in broad-spectrum antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST). Total bacterial respiration was converted into faradaic current by electro-oxidation of ferrocyanide, produced when ferricyanide is reduced by bacterial electron-transport. For Escherichia coli (E. coli), the signal was linear with 5–13 × 10⁸ colony-forming units in measuring buffer. For AST, test cells were treated with drugs before ferricyanide addition; cell counts from the amperometric assay provided a measure of drug-induced cell death. Initial trials with six antimicrobial agents produced incorrect susceptibility classifications for drugs that were electroactive at the potential used to detect ferrocyanide or which affected cellular respiration rates. We therefore changed the procedure from drug-treatment and assay in the same buffer to sequential drug exposure in treatment buffer, centrifugal separation of surviving cells, cell resuspension, incubation in the presence of ferricyanide and finally ferrocyanide amperometry in drug-free buffer. Data analysis with E. coli led to an activity classification that agreed with cell culture-based ASTs, obtained by a quicker, more convenient procedure. The potential of this approach was confirmed by trials with the highly virulent bacterium Burkholderia pseudomallei, a particularly antimicrobial-resistant pathogen that is the cause of lethal melioidosis in tropical climates and is currently of concern as a potential bioterrorism agent.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBurkholderia pseudomallei 3aEscherichia coli 3aanti-infective agents 3aantibiotic resistance 3aaspartate transaminase 3abacteria 3abioterrorism 3acell death 3acell respiration 3adrugs 3aelectrochemistry 3amelioidosis 3apathogens 3arespiratory rate 3atropics 3avirulence1 aSuginta, Wipa1 aSchulte, Albert0 tAnalytical chemistry.g2014 Oct. 21, v. 86, no. 20 p.10315-10322dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-68827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fac502554s3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03065naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100002800138245015700166300001600323500002000339520161600359592002801975650001802003650001902021650001302040650001102053650002002064650001402084650001502098650002502113650001202138650001002150650001702160650001402177650001702191650001502208650002002223650001902243650002102262650002202283650001402305650001002319651001102329700002102340773012902361856007202490852000902562655001202571IND60648200220221122070526.0190627e20150327xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064820022DNAL7 a10.3390/f60409142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDoblas-Miranda, Enrique10aLocalized Effects of Coarse Woody Material on Soil Oribatid Communities Diminish over 700 Years of Stand Development in Black-Spruce-Feathermoss Forests  ap. 914-928.  aJournal Article  aIn the black-spruce clay-belt region of Western Québec, soil nutrients are limited due to paludification. Under paludified conditions, nutrient subsidies from decomposing surface coarse woody material (CWM) may be important particularly during the later stages of ecosystem development when deadwood from senescent trees has accumulated. For soil organisms, CWM can alter microclimatic conditions and resource availability. We compared abundance and species richness of oribatid mites below or adjacent to CWM across a chronosequence which spans ca. 700 years of stand development. We hypothesized that oribatid abundance and richness would be greater under the logs, particularly in later stages of forest development when logs may act as localized sources of carbon and nutrients in the paludified substrate. However, oribatid density was lower directly under CWM than adjacent to CWM but these differences were attenuated with time. We suggest that oribatids may be affected by soil compaction and also that such microarthropods are most likely feeding on recently fallen leaf litter, which may be rendered inaccessible by the presence of overlying CWM. This may also explain the progressive decline in oribatid density and diversity with time, which are presumably caused by decreases in litter availability due to self-thinning and Sphagnum growth. This is also supported by changes of different oribatid trophic groups, as litter feeders maintain different numbers relative to CWM with time while more generalist fungi feeders only show differences related to position in the beginning of the succession.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPicea mariana 3aSarcoptiformes 3aSphagnum 3acarbon 3achronosequences 3adead wood 3aecosystems 3aforestry development 3aforests 3afungi 3amicroclimate 3anutrients 3aplant litter 3asoil biota 3asoil compaction 3asoil nutrients 3aspecies richness 3astand development 3asubsidies 3atrees 3aQuebec1 aWork, Timothy T.0 tForests.g2015 Mar. 27, v. 6, no. 4 p.914-928dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2257x1999-49077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/f60409143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03134naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100005700146245013900203300001800342520138500360592002801745596008901773596007901862650002101941650002201962650001601984650001902000650001302019650001202032650001702044650001302061650001902074650001502093650001402108650001902122650001602141650001902157650001202176650002402188650002202212653002502234653002402259653001402283700001802297700002002315700001302335700001702348700001602365773012202381856008002503852000902583655001202592IND60655007620221119053326.0190729e201906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065500762DNAL7 a10.1177/00405175187927502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZeng, Shaohua1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0217-711210aMechanical and thermal properties of carbon nanotube- and graphene-glass fiber fabric-reinforced epoxy composites: A comparative study  ap. 2353-2363.  aThis study was focused on the comparative effect of tube- and sheet-like nanocarbons on the structure–property relationships of fiber-reinforced composites. Graphene nanosheets and multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) were dispersed into commercial glass fiber fabric (Gf) to obtain multiscale graphene-Gf- and MWCNT-Gf-reinforcing materials, respectively, followed by a vacuum-assisted resin infusion process. The influence of MWCNTs and graphene on the mechanical and thermal performance of multiscale composites were investigated. The experimental results indicated that oxidized MWCNTs or graphene could ensure excellent dispersibility on the fiber surface, and ultimately enhance the mechanical properties and thermal stability of the resultant composites. Graphene oxide (GO), with a wrinkled and roughened texture, was shown to be superior to MWCNTs in terms of toughening the fiber/matrix interface and delaying the deformation or failure of the epoxy matrix. Under the same dosage of nanocarbons, the interlaminar shear strength of GO-Gf-reinforced composites (GO-GfCs) was raised by approximately 12%, and the relevant onset thermal-decomposition temperature was increased by > 11℃, compared with carboxyl MWCNT-Gf-reinforced composites (Mc-GfCs). Meanwhile, the GO-GfCs exhibited superior static and dynamic mechanical properties compared to those of Mc-GfCs.  aPublisher supplied data  aKYLX16_0734cPostgraduate Research & Practice Innovation Program of Jiangsu Province  a2018B40814cFundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, China 3acarbon nanotubes 3acomparative study 3adeformation 3adispersibility 3aepoxides 3afabrics 3aglass fibers 3agraphene 3agraphene oxide 3ananosheets 3aoxidation 3ashear strength 3atemperature 3atextile fibers 3atexture 3athermal degradation 3athermal stability 0asurface modification 0aglass fiber fabrics 0ainterface1 aShen, Mingxia1 aChen, Shangneng1 aYang, Lu1 aLu, Fengling1 aXue, Yijiao0 tTextile research journal.g2019 June, v. 89, no. 12 p.2353-2363dSAGE PublicationswJournal:jnl46536x1746-77487nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/00405175187927503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02903naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001500145245011500160300001600275520167900291592002801970650002101998650001502019650001202034650002202046650002502068650001902093650001202112650001502124650001202139650002102151650002102172650000702193650001402200650001502214700001402229700001702243773014202260852000902402856008202411655001202493IND4414187520221122051851.0200207e200901  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441418752DNAL7 a10.1007/s00253-008-1759-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJiang, Xia10aTransient-state biodegradation behavior of a horizontal biotrickling filter in co-treating gaseous H2S and NH3  ap. 969-975.  aA horizontal biotrickling filter (HBTF) was used to inoculate autotrophic sulfide-oxidizing and ammonia-oxidizing microbial consortiums over H₂S-exhausted carbon for co-treating H₂S and NH₃ waste gas in a long-term operation. In this study, several aspects (i.e., pH change, shock loading and starvation) of the dynamic behavior of the HBTF were investigated. The metabolic products of N and S bearing species in recycling liquid and biological activities of the biofilm were analyzed to explain the observed phenomena and further explore the fundamentals behind. In the pH range of 4–8.5, although the removal efficiencies of H₂S and NH₃ remained 96–98% and 100%, respectively, the metabolic products demonstrated different removal mechanisms and pathways. NH₄-N and NO₂/NO₃-N were dominated at pH ≤6 and ≥7, respectively, indicating the differentiated contributions from physical/chemical adsorption and bio-oxidation. Moreover, the HBTF demonstrated a good dynamic stability to withstand shock loadings by recovering immediately to the original. During shock loading, only 15.4% and 17.9% of captured H₂S and NH₃ was biodegraded, respectively. After 2, 11, and 48 days of starvation, the HBTF system reached a full performance within reasonable re-startup times (2–80 h), possibly due to the consumption of reduced S and N species in biomass or activated carbon thus converted into SO₄-S and NO₃-N during starvation period. The results helped to understand the fundamental knowledge by revealing the effects of pH and transient loadings linked with individual removal mechanism for H₂S and NH₃ co-treatment in different conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactivated carbon 3aadsorption 3aammonia 3aammonium nitrogen 3abioactive properties 3abiodegradation 3abiofilm 3abiofilters 3abiomass 3ahydrogen sulfide 3anitrate nitrogen 3apH 3arecycling 3astarvation1 aYan, Rong1 aTay, Joo Hwa0 tApplied microbiology and biotechnology.g2009 Jan., v. 81, no. 5 p.969-975dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl35319x0175-75987nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00253-008-1759-93Available from publisher's site 7aarticle02870naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004900094040001800143100001700161245006200178300001600240500000900256520163800265592002801903650002001931650002101951650002601972650001301998650002702011650001002038650001702048650001502065650000902080650001102089650000902100650002202109650001702131650001702148650001502165700001602180773014702196856009602343852000902439655001202448IND60668442520221119120630.0191125e198605  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066844252DNAL7 a10.2136/sssaj1986.03615995005000030038x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIstok, J.

Development of methods for computing the frequency of occurrence of these conditions using historical precipitation and air temperature data is reported. The methods are based on dividing hourly precipitation and air temperature data into precipitation events, freezing events, and event clusters. Precipitation events are defined as “wet” hours separated by “dry” hours. Freezing events are defined as periods of consecutive “cold” hours (air temperatures <0°C) separated by periods of consecutive “warm” hours (air temperatures >0°C). Event clusters are defined as over-lapping precipitation and freezing events. Sets of characteristics are defined for each type of event and for event clusters, e.g., duration and amount of precipitation for precipitation events, and freeze index and minimum temperature for freezing events. Joint frequency distributions for event and cluster characteristics are obtained, and examples show how to use these to predict frequency of occurrence of climatic conditions known to result in high rates of soil erosion. Application of joint frequency distributions to the Soil Conservation Service's curve number method for predicting watershed runoff is discussed, and it is shown how joint frequency distributions for precipitation amount and freeze index can be combined with the results of discriminant analysis for the occurrence of soil frost to compute the frequency of occurrence of rainfall on a frozen soil surface.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair temperature 3aclimatic factors 3adiscriminant analysis 3afreezing 3afrequency distribution 3afrost 3afrozen soils 3aprediction 3arain 3arunoff 3asoil 3asoil conservation 3asoil erosion 3asoil quality 3awatersheds1 aBoersma, L.0 tSoil Science Society of America journal.g1986 May, v. 50, no. 3 p.752-758dSoil Science Society of AmericawJournal:jnl44580x0361-59957nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2136/sssaj1986.03615995005000030038x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01318naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245013100167300001600298500001400314520041200328592002800740650001500768650002100783650002700804650001500831650001000846773008200856856008100938852000901019655001201028IND60730300220221122064444.0210307e20210302xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073030022DNAL7 a10.1163/15685403-bja100932doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIzawa, Kunihiko12aA new and a known species of Taeniacanthus Sumpf, 1871 (Copepoda, Cyclopoida, Taeniacanthidae) parasitic on Japanese fishes  ap. 343-356.  aNAL-light  aTaeniacanthus aulacocephali sp. nov. recovered from Aulacocephalus temminckii Bleeker, 1855 (Serranidae) is described and T. sebastichthydis Yamaguti, 1939 collected from Sebastiscus marmoratus (Cuvier, 1829) and Sebastes inermis Cuvier, 1829 (Sebastidae) is redescribed.

We propose that information on processes shaping natural epigenetic variation can be gained using the spatial structure of genetic diversity as null model. Departures of epigenetic isolation‐by‐distance (IBD) patterns from genetic IBD patterns for the same sample, particularly differences in slope of similarity‐distance regressions, will reflect the action of factors that operate specifically on epigenetic variation, including imperfect transgenerational inheritance and responsiveness to environmental factors of epigenetic marks. As a proof of concept, we provide a comparative analysis of spatial genetic and epigenetic structure of 200 mapped individuals of the perennial herb Helleborus foetidus. Plants were fingerprinted using nuclear microsatellites, amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AFLP) and methylation‐sensitive AFLP markers. Expectations from individual‐level IBD patterns were tested by means of kinship‐distance regressions. Both genetic and epigenetic similarity between H. foetidus individuals conformed to theoretical expectations under individual‐level IBD models. Irrespective of marker type, there were significant negative linear relationships between the kinship coefficient for plant pairs and their spatial separation. Regression slopes were significantly steeper for epigenetic markers. Epigenetic similarity between individuals was much greater than genetic similarity at shortest distances, such epigenetic ‘kinship excess’ tending to decrease as plant separation increased. Results suggest that moderate‐to‐high heritability and responsiveness to local environments are major drivers of epigenetic spatial structure in H. foetidus, and illustrate the heuristic value of comparing genetic and epigenetic spatial structure for formulating and testing hypotheses on forces shaping epigenetic diversity in wild plant populations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHelleborus foetidus 3aamplified fragment length polymorphism 3aenvironmental factors 3aepigenetics 3agenetic variation 3aheritability 3akinship 3amicrosatellite repeats 3amodels 3awild plants1 aMedrano, Mónica1 aBazaga, Pilar0 tMolecular ecology.g2016 Apr., v. 25, no. 8 p.1653-1664dBlackwell Scientific Publicationsx0962-10837nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/mec.135763Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03846naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001200143245010200155300001800257520211000275592002802385650001802413650001902431650001402450650001202464650001402476650001602490650001002506650000902516650001302525650000902538650002202547650002302569650002002592650001902612650001602631650000702647650001802654650002102672650001502693650002402708650001502732650001702747650002002764650002002784650002302804650000902827650002902836653001402865653001702879653001102896653001802907700001802925700002002943700001602963773015402979856007803133852000903211655001203220IND60539592620221121002021.0190318e201509  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053959262DNAL7 a10.3168/jds.2014-91742doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQiu, Y.14aThe effect of microfiltration on color, flavor, and functionality of 80% whey protein concentrate  ap. 5862-5873.  aThe residual annatto colorant in fluid Cheddar cheese whey is bleached to provide a neutral-colored final product. Currently, hydrogen peroxide (HP) and benzoyl peroxide are used for bleaching liquid whey. However, previous studies have shown that chemical bleaching causes off-flavor formation, mainly due to lipid oxidation and protein degradation. The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of microfiltration (MF) on norbixin removal and to compare flavor and functionality of 80% whey protein concentrate (WPC80) from MF whey to WPC80 from whey bleached with HP or lactoperoxidase (LP). Cheddar cheese whey was manufactured from colored, pasteurized milk. The fluid whey was pasteurized and fat separated. Liquid whey was subjected to 4 different treatments: control (no bleaching; 50°C, 1 h), HP (250 mg of HP/kg; 50°C, 1 h), and LP (20 mg of HP/kg; 50°C, 1 h), or MF (microfiltration; 50°C, 1 h). The treated whey was then ultrafiltered, diafiltered, and spray-dried to 80% concentrate. The entire experiment was replicated 3 times. Proximate analyses, color, functionality, descriptive sensory and instrumental volatile analysis were conducted on WPC80. The MF and HP- and LP-bleached WPC80 displayed a 39.5, 40.9, and 92.8% norbixin decrease, respectively. The HP and LP WPC80 had higher cardboard flavors and distinct cabbage flavor compared with the unbleached and MF WPC80. Volatile compound results were consistent with sensory results. The HP and LP WPC80 were higher in lipid oxidation compounds (especially heptanal, hexanal, pentanal, 1-hexen-3-one, 2-pentylfuran, and octanal) compared with unbleached and MF WPC80. All WPC80 had >85% solubility across the pH range of 3 to 7. The microstructure of MF gels determined by confocal laser scanning showed an increased protein particle size in the gel network. MF WPC80 also had larger storage modulus values, indicating higher gel firmness. Based on bleaching efficacy comparable to chemical bleaching with HP, flavor, and functionality results, MF is a viable alternative to chemical or enzymatic bleaching of fluid whey.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBixa orellana 3aCheddar cheese 3ableaching 3acabbage 3acardboard 3acheese whey 3acolor 3adyes 3afirmness 3agels 3ahydrogen peroxide 3alipid peroxidation 3amicrofiltration 3amicrostructure 3aoff flavors 3apH 3aparticle size 3apasteurized milk 3aperoxidase 3aprotein degradation 3asolubility 3aspray drying 3astorage modulus 3aultrafiltration 3avolatile compounds 3awhey 3awhey protein concentrate 0ableaching 0awhey protein 0aflavor 0afunctionality1 aSmith, Tommy,1 aFoegeding, E.A.1 aDrake, M.A.0 tJournal of dairy science.g2015 Sept., v. 98, no. 9 p.5862-5873dElsevier Inc.aAmerican Dairy Science AssociationwJournal:jnl45500x0022-03027nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3168/jds.2014-91743Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03916naa a2200817 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146072000900164072000900173100001900182245014700201300001400348500002400362500001500386520141000401650002301811650002101834650001901855650001001874650002801884650002501912650004301937650001901980650002501999650002002024650001402044650001802058650001702076650001302093650000902106650002502115650002002140650001602160650003602176650001302212650002702225650001802252650001302270650002602283650001202309650003102321650002402352650002802376650004202404650003102446650004802477650003802525650000902563650003302572650002702605650000902632650001702641653001402658653001402672653002202686653002602708653003402734653004002768700001902808773009602827852000902923856008502932930003303017945002503050946001103075655001203086IND4419552920221119114140.0090424e20090504xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441955292DNAL7 a194293342pmid7 a10.1016/j.jep.2009.02.0382doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aX380 0aS2001 aSingh, Jyotsna10aAntihyperglycemic and antioxidant effect of Berberis aristata root extract and its role in regulating carbohydrate metabolism in diabetic rats  ap. 22-26.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aEthnopharmacological relevance: Berberis aristata DC root is used in traditional medicine for a number of ailments including metabolic disorders. Aim of the study: The aim of the present study was to explore the antihyperglycemic and antioxidant potential of 50% aqueous ethanolic root extract of Berberis aristata (BA) in alloxan induced diabetic rats. Materials and methods: BA root extract (250mg/kg) was administered to diabetic rats and standard drug glybenclamide (0.6mg/kg) to group serving as positive control. Effect of extract on antioxidant and carbohydrate metabolism regulating enzymes of liver was studied in diabetic rats along with its safety parameters. Results: The main constituents of root were identified as berberine, berbamine and palmatine through HPTLC. The extract besides being safe, lowered the blood glucose significantly without any hypoglycemic effect on their control counterparts. It increased CAT, SOD, GPx, GR activity significantly and reduced lipid peroxidation (41.6%) and protein carbonylation (30.15%). It also increased the glucokinase and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase activities and decreased glucose-6-phosphatase activity in diabetic rats which play a critical role in glucose homeostasis. Conclusion: Thus, the extract of Berberis sristata (root) has strong potential to regulate glucose homeostasis through decreased gluconeogenesis and oxidative stress. 3alipid peroxidation 3amedicinal plants 3aplant extracts 3aroots 3acarbohydrate metabolism 3amedicinal properties 3aNADP-glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase 3aphytochemicals 3asuperoxide dismutase 3aglycemic effect 3aberberine 3ablood glucose 3ahypoglycemia 3adiabetes 3arats 3aantioxidant activity 3aenzyme activity 3aglucokinase 3aglutathione-disulfide reductase 3acatalase 3aglutathione peroxidase 3aanimal models 3aBerberis 3aglucose-6-phosphatase 2aAnimals 2aAntioxidantsxpharmacology 2aBerberisxchemistry 2aBlood Glucosexanalysis 2aCarbohydrate Metabolismxdrug effects 2aChromatography, Thin Layer 2aDiabetes Mellitus, Experimentalxmetabolism 2aHypoglycemic Agentsxpharmacology 2aMale 2aPlant Extractsxpharmacology 2aPlant Rootsxchemistry 2aRats 2aRats, Wistar 0apalmatine 0aberbamine 0aBerberis aristata 0aprotein carbonylation 0aglutathione reductase (NADPH) 0aglucose-6-phosphate 1-dehydrogenase1 aKakkar, Poonam0 tJournal of ethnopharmacology.g2009 May 4, v. 123, no. 1 p.22-26dElsevierx0378-87417nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jep.2009.02.0383Available from publisher's Web site  a20090911b20091002c00000000  aINDd2CTe2009/08/13  aNon-US 7aarticle03359naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146072000900164072000900173072000900182100001800191245007600209300001400285500002400299520202300323650001602346650002102362650001002383650001602393650002502409650002502434650002602459650001302485650002302498650002502521650003802546650002402584651001102608651001102619773009602630852000902726856008502735930003302820945002502853946001102878655001202889IND4419553320221119114055.0090424e20090504xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441955332DNAL7 a194293382pmid7 a10.1016/j.jep.2009.02.0312doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aS200 0aF000 0aX3801 aAl-Qura'n, S.10aEthnopharmacological survey of wild medicinal plants in Showbak, Jordan  ap. 45-50.  aIncludes references  aTwo main research questions are framing this investigation: (1) the main taxa of the medicinal importance value altered the Showbak forest stand and species composition? (2) The most safe species and what are the toxic ones (unsafe). These two research questions are the vital ones to draw a clear image about the wild medicinal plants of this investigated area of Showbak region in Jordan. 79 wild medicinal plant species were investigated in this study which are used in traditional medication for the treatment of various diseases. Most of the locals interviewed dealt with well-known safe medicinal plants such as Aaronsohnia factorovskyi Warb. et Eig., Achillea santolina L., Adiantum capillus-veneris L., Artemisia herba-alba L., Ceratonia siliqua L., Clematis recta L., Herniaria hirsuta L., Malva neglecta Wallr., Rosmarinus officinalis L., Ruta chalepensis L., Salvia triloba L., Sarcopoterium spinosa (L.) Spach., Thymbra capitata (L.) Hof, and Urginea maritima Barker. Many of the wild medicinal plants investigated were toxic and needed to be practiced by practitioners and herbalists rather than the local healers. These plants include Calotropis procera Willd R.Br., Citrullus colocynthis (L.) Sch., Datura stramonium L., Digitalis purpurea L., Ecballium elaterium (L.) A.Rich., Euphorbia helioscopia L., Euphorbia tinctoria Boiss., Glaucium corniculatum (L.)

The conservation of medicinal plants and natural resources is becoming increasingly important, so this research is trying to collect information from local population concerning the use of medicinal plants in Showbak; identify the most important specie; determine the relative importance value of the species and calculate the informant consensus factor (ICF) for the medicinal plants. Obtaining results is relied on the interviewee's personal information and the medicinal use of specific plants. 3awild plants 3amedicinal plants 3aflora 3aethnobotany 3amedicinal properties 3aindigenous knowledge 3abotanical composition 3atoxicity 3aindigenous peoples 3atraditional medicine 2aPlants, Medicinalxclassification 2aSpecies Specificity 3aJordan 0aJordan0 tJournal of ethnopharmacology.g2009 May 4, v. 123, no. 1 p.45-50dElsevierx0378-87417nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jep.2009.02.0313Available from publisher's Web site  a20090911b20091002c00000000  aINDd2CTe2009/08/13  aNon-US 7aarticle02860naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003800111040001800149072000900167100001700176245015100193300001800344500002400362520128600386650001201672650002601684650001501710650002401725650002301749650005401772650001701826650003601843650002201879650003601901650005501937650001501992653002902007700001602036700001902052700002202071700001902093773010002112852000902212856008802221930003302309945002502342946001102367655001202378IND4427701620221119114011.0091023e20091106xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442770162DNAL7 a197967682pmid7 a10.1016/j.chroma.2009.09.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF6001 aBonny, Sarah10aOptimization of a microwave-assisted extraction of secondary metabolites from crustose lichens with quantitative spectrophotodensitometry analysis  ap. 7651-7656.  aIncludes references  aA focused and rapid microwave-assisted extraction (MAE) process was carried out and optimized for secondary metabolites from crustose lichens using Taguchi experimental design and quantitative analysis on TLC by a Camag® spectrophotodensitometer. The procedure was improved by quantitative determination of norstictic acid (NA), a common depsidone isolated from Pertusaria pseudocorallina (Sw.) Arn. Various experimental parameters that can potentially affect the NA extraction yields including extraction time, irradiation power, volume and the percentage of tetrahydrofuran (THF) were optimized. Results suggest that THF percentage and solvent volume were statistically the most significant factors. The optimal conditions were determined as follows: THF level of 100%, solvent volume of 15mL, microwave power of 100W and extraction time of 7min. Compared to the reflux method, MAE showed a drastic reduction of extraction time (7min vs. 3h) and solvent consumption (15mL vs. 30mL). The NA in total yield was 90% using the two methods. The optimal conditions were applied to other crustose lichens, Aspicilia radiosa, Diploicia canescens and Ochrolechia parella for the extraction of NA, diploicine (DP) and variolaric acid (VA), with 83%, 90% and 95% of recovery, respectively. 3alichens 3asecondary metabolites 3aextraction 3amicrowave treatment 3aanalytical methods 2aChemical Fractionationxinstrumentationxmethods. 2aDensitometry 2aDepsidesxanalysisxmetabolism. 2aFuransxchemistry 2aLactonesxanalysisxmetabolism. 2aLichensxchemistryxmetabolismxradiation effects. 2aMicrowaves 0aspectrophotodensitometry1 aHitti, Eric1 aBoustie, Joël1 aBernard, Aurélie1 aTomasi, Sophie0 tJournal of chromatography.g2009 Nov. 6, v. 1216, no. 45 p.7651-7656dElsevierx0021-96737nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chroma.2009.09.0093Available from publisher's Web site  a20091120b20091204c00000000  aINDdRHFe2009/11/19  aNon-US 7aarticle02403naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002800111040001800139100001400157245007300171300001800244520126900262650001801531650001901549650001601568650002001584650001401604650001401618650001701632650003601649653001501685653001101700700001801711700001301729700001701742773008801759852000901847856007801856930003301934945001301967946001301980655001201993IND2036734020221119114125.0940113e199210  nyu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203673402DNAL7 a242547242pmid7 a10.1007/BF027511072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aInoue, M.10aAllelochemicals from Polygonum sachalinense Fr.

The rhizomes and roots of P. sachalinense were extracted with 80% acetone. Bioassay of the neutral-acidic fraction on the TLC agar plate showed the inhibitory activity corresponded to the two yellow pigment bands. Two orange needles were isolated and identified as anthraquinone compounds: emodin and physcion. Both compounds exhibited inhibitory activities against the seedling growth of several testing plant species. Glucosides were isolated from P. sachalinense and were identified as emodin-1-O-beta-D-glucoside and physcion-1-O-beta-D-glucoside, respectively. On plant growth bioassay, these glucosides showed no phytotoxic activity against lettuce seedlings. The concentrations of emodin, physcion, and their glucosides from rhizome with roots, aerial parts, fallen leaves, and soil were determined. The rhizome with roots and fallen leaves contained emodin and physcion at relatively high concentrations. Emodin also occurs in the soil of this plant community with effective concentrations in the fall. The results indicate that these anthraquinones are responsible for the observed interference and are potent allelopathic substances. 3aroot exudates 3aanthraquinones 3aallelopathy 3aallelochemicals 3abioassays 3aseedlings 3aweed control 3achemical constituents of plants 0ainhibition 0agrowth1 aNishimura, H.1 aLi, H.H.1 aMizutani, J.0 tJournal of chemical ecology.g1992 Oct., v. 18, no. 10 p.1833-1840x0098-03317nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF027511073Available from publisher's Web site  a19940202b19940204c00000000  aINDdLDP  aOther US 7aarticle03492naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134072000900152072000900161100001500170245010700185300001600292500002400308500001500332520181100347650002502158650002102183650001402204650001702218650002602235650001602261650001502277650002002292650001402312650003802326650002102364650002502385650001602410650002002426650001802446650002102464650001402485650001902499653002102518653001302539653002102552653001402573700002902587700001902616773010702635852000902742856009202751930003302843945002502876946001302901655001202914IND4408376120221119114303.0080801e200808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440837612DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1750-3841.2008.00848.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ504 0aT3001 aSong, Y.S.10aQuantification of Human IgE Immunoreactive Soybean Proteins in Commercial Soy Ingredients and Products  ap.

Optimum dilutions of primary antibody and antigens as well as detection sensitivity were determined for the implementation of a sandwich ELISA method using plasma from soy sensitive subjects (IgE ranging from 0.35 to 98.7 IU/mL). Human IgE immunoreactivity of commercial soybean ingredients showed that the plasma of subjects with strong allergic reaction to soybean presented proportionally higher immunoreactive response. Soy protein isolate and soy protein concentrate contained less immunoreactive proteins than soy flour and grits. As expected, a hypoallergenic soybean product presented the lowest IgE immunoreactivity. Hydrolyzed and fermented soy ingredients showed negligible human IgE immunoreactivity when proteins and peptides were < 20 kDa. The IgE immunoreactivity of soymilk samples ranged from 3.4 to 68.9 ng IgE/mg extracted protein. Tofu contained about 20-fold higher IgE immunoreactivity than soymilk products (median 171 ng IgE/mg extracted protein). Furthermore, soy cheese products presented twice the IgE immunoreactivity than tofu products (median 359 ng IgE/mg protein). Meat analogues presented considerably high extracted protein concentration (median 67.9 mg/g product). The findings of the current investigation demonstrate sandwich ELISA as a reliable immunochemical method with good repeatability, sensitivity, and low detection limit to quantify IgE immunoreactive proteins in soy ingredients and products. Quantitative measurement of specific IgE is likely to become an increasingly valuable tool for soybean industry to comply with food labeling for manufacturers, thus protecting soy-sensitive consumers. 3aprotein concentrates 3aprotein isolates 3asoy flour 3afermentation 3aquantitative analysis 3asoy protein 3aantibodies 3aimmunochemistry 3aallergens 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3aimmunoglobulin E 3aenzymatic hydrolysis 3aingredients 3aimmune response 3arepeatability 3amolecular weight 3adetection 3afood allergies 0atest sensitivity 0aantigens 0asoybean products 0asoy grits1 aMartinez-Villaluenga, C.1 ade Mejia, E.G.0 tJournal of food science.g2008 Aug., v. 73, no. 6 p.T90-T99dBlackwell Publishing Incx0022-11477nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1750-3841.2008.00848.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20090325b20090508c00000000  aINDd2CTe2009/03/04  aOther US 7aarticle03527naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002300094024004200117040001800159100001700177245009100194300001600285500011200301520198600413650001902399650001202418650002302430650002202453650001402475650001402489650001502503650001402518650001502532650002402547650001702571650001702588650001102605650001302616651001402629651001202643700001802655700001502673700001902688700001602707773014402723856005502867856011402922852000903036655001203045IND60697304120221119114252.0200604e20191108xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069730412DNAL7 a10113/69730412hdl7 a10.17660/ActaHortic.2019.1256.442doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEkman, J.

However, much of the basic research linking shelf life to temperature was conducted decades ago and may be based on different varieties, growing conditions and marketing chains. Furthermore, recommendations do not always consider commercial issues or the costs and returns on investment in improved product management. To verify, and potentially revise, storage temperature recommendations, we conducted trials examining storage and shelf life of selected vegetables grown in south-east Australia. Vegetables were stored at 2, 4, 7 or 12°C for up to 39 days, removed at intervals of 2-5 days, and visually assessed for external quality. The estimated storage life of buk choy and choy sum reduced with higher storage temperatures, whereas the inverse occurred for chilling sensitive vegetables including Lebanese cucumber, eggplant and zucchini. Capsicums, especially red capsicums, were found to be less chilling sensitive than previously reported, with storage life maximised at 2-4°C. A key finding was that chilling sensitive vegetables could be stored for several days or even longer at nominally damaging temperatures (i.e., 2-4°C) before damage occurred. Also, short-term storage temperature was less critical than previously thought. These results demonstrate it is not always necessary to cool product to the 'optimum' temperature to achieve the quality and shelf life required for transport and retail. That may have considerable logistical benefits, e.g., when produce needs to be held at less than optimal temperatures due to transport within mixed loads. Raising the storage temperature by even a few degrees can reduce cooling costs as well as wear on plant and equipment. This information can help members of the supply chain decide on the most cost-effective temperature for cold rooms and trucks, providing acceptable quality and storage life without adding unnecessary cost. 3acold treatment 3acooling 3acost effectiveness 3acosts and returns 3acucumbers 3aeggplants 3aguidelines 3amarketing 3ashelf life 3astorage temperature 3astorage time 3asupply chain 3atrucks 3azucchini 3aAustralia 3aLebanon1 aGoldwater, A.1 aWinley, E.1 aMarques, J.

Quantitative matrices that were borrowed from landscape ecology were first used to measure the variety and spatial arrangement of open space plots and landuses around houses. Amenity values of those measures were then evaluated in a hedonic regression that was corrected for identification problem caused by the endogeneity of landuse variables. Empirical estimates from this research reveal that urban residents positively valued the varieties of open space but negatively valued the diversity within developed land uses in their neighborhoods. Similarly, open space plots with square shape and smooth, straight edges were preferred to those with more complex shapes and irregular edges. Further, residents preferred open spaces in few larger plots to many smaller pieces that are scattered throughout the neighborhood. Findings from this study will be useful in enhancing the quality and amenity value of open spaces and conceivably increase local property tax base. 3amodels 3aland use 3aland policy 3aurban areas 3aattitudes and opinions 3aarea 3aurban planning 3ashape 0aopen space 0aHedonic model1 aHodges, Donald G.1 aTonn, Bruce1 aCho, Seong-Hoon0 tForest policy and economics.g2009 May, v. 11, no. 3 p.194-201dElsevier Sciencex1389-93417nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.forpol.2009.02.0073Available from publisher's Web site  a20090905b20091002c00000000  aINDd8CTe2009/08/01  aNon-US 7aarticle03376naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002300094024004200117040001800159100001600177245008900193300001600282500011200298520182400410650002002234650001302254650002102267650001002288650001302298650001802311650001402329650001702343650002202360650002302382650001502405650002402420650001702444650001202461650002502473650001602498650001102514700001702525700001802542700001202560773014402572856005502716856011402771852000902885655001202894IND60697304520221119114016.0200604e20191108xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069730452DNAL7 a10113/69730452hdl7 a10.17660/ActaHortic.2019.1256.482doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOh, Sung-ll10aEnhanced shelf life of jujube (Ziziphus jujuba Mill.) using aqueous chlorine dioxide  ap. 343-348.  aPaper presented at the VI International Conference Postharvest Unlimited held Oct 17-20, 2020 Madrid, Spain  aIn this study, we aimed to determine the appropriate conditions for storage of jujube (Ziziphus jujuba Mill.). Jujube was treated with aqueous chlorine dioxide (10, 25, and 50 mg L(‑1) for 1, 5, and 10 min) and was stored at 0±0.3°C (optimal storage temperature) and 90±5% relative humidity for six weeks. The weight loss rate of all samples increased during storage, but it was not significantly different among treatments. The percent of weight loss after six weeks of storage ranged from 0.4 to 1.4%. The colour change (ΔE) values, soluble solid content, and firmness of jujube were not significantly different among treatments. However, the sensory evaluation index was higher for chlorine dioxide-treated samples than untreated samples with regard to palatability, texture, and off-odor. The decay rate of all samples increased during storage, and after storage for six weeks it was the highest in the 10 mg L(‑1) - 1 min treatment group (50.0%) and was the lowest in the 50 mg L(‑1) - 5 min treatment group (23.0%).

These results suggest that aqueous chlorine dioxide treatment (particularly treatment at 50 mg L(‑1) for 5 min) improved microbiological characteristics and preserved the quality of jujube during storage. 3aZiziphus jujuba 3achlorine 3achlorine dioxide 3acolor 3afirmness 3amolds (fungi) 3aoff odors 3apalatability 3arelative humidity 3asensory evaluation 3ashelf life 3astorage temperature 3astorage time 3atexture 3atotal soluble solids 3aweight loss 3ayeasts1 aLee, Sugwang1 aKim, Chul-Woo1 aLee, Uk0 tActa horticulturae.g2019 Nov. 8, , no. 1256 p.343-348dInternational Society for Horticultural Science.wJournal:jnl46289x0567-75727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.17660/ActaHortic.2019.1256.4840uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/69730453Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  aDNAL 7aarticle02846naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002300094024004200117040001800159100001900177245015100196300001600347500011200363520130100475650002501776650000801801650001301809650002401822650001101846650001601857650001301873650001501886650002301901650001701924650001301941650002601954700001801980700002001998700001702018700002402035700001902059773014402078856005502222856011402277852000902391655001202400IND60697304420221119113913.0200604e20191108xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069730442DNAL7 a10113/69730442hdl7 a10.17660/ActaHortic.2019.1256.472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPristijono, P.14aThe application of UV-C irradiation followed by storage in continuous low level ethylene atmosphere to delay the ripening of mature green tomatoes  ap. 335-342.  aPaper presented at the VI International Conference Postharvest Unlimited held Oct 17-20, 2020 Madrid, Spain  aMature green tomatoes (Solanum lycopersicum ‘Neang Pich’) were exposed to 0, 3.1, 7.1, 10.5 and 13.6 kJ m(‑2) UV-C irradiation at 20°C. After treatment, tomatoes were stored in continuous air containing either <0.005 or 0.1 μL L(‑1) ethylene at 20°C and 100% RH for up to 11 days. The untreated fruit (0 kJ m‑2 UV-C) ripened significantly faster than UV-C treatments in both storage conditions. All UV-C treatments followed by storage at either <0.005 and 0.1 μL L(‑1) ethylene had significantly slower ethylene production rates throughout the ripening period. There was no difference between treatments in fruit TSS, TA and, TSS/TA ratio. After storage, fruit treated with 10.5 and 13.6 kJ m(‑2) UV-C were significantly firmer than untreated fruits for both storage conditions. Overall, tomatoes stored at <0.005 μL L(‑1) ethylene were significantly firmer and had lower TSS/TA ratio than fruits stored at 0.1 μL L(‑1) ethylene. These results show that UV-C treatment delayed ripening of tomatoes in the presence of low level of ethylene during storage. In the absence of added ethylene, UV-C treatment resulted in firmer fruit with higher TSS and TSS/TA ratios. This new treatment could be used to extend the shelf-life of mature green tomatoes through the supply chain. 3aSolanum lycopersicum 3aair 3aethylene 3aethylene production 3afruits 3airradiation 3aripening 3ashelf life 3astorage conditions 3asupply chain 3atomatoes 3aultraviolet radiation1 aBowyer, M.

The peptides are released by the digestion of caseins and whey proteins. Peptides derived from the different genetic variants A, B, C, E, F1, F2, G1, G2, H, I, and J of bovine κ-casein (CSN3) were investigated for their inhibitory activities against angiotensin I converting enzyme (ACE). Amino acid sequences of the CSN3 variants were analyzed in silico to detect potential ACE inhibitory peptides. Besides known biologically active peptides, exclusive peptides were identified in some CSN3 variants and their biological activity was determined: within CSN3*B and CSN3*C, the ACE inhibitory peptide ASP (IC₅₀ = 242.3; the IC₅₀ value is equivalent to the micromolar concentration of peptide mediating a 50% inhibition of ACE activity) and within CSN3*C the peptide AHHP (IC₅₀ = 847.6) was detected. Furthermore, the peptides VSP (IC₅₀ = 21.8) and ACHP (IC₅₀ = 360.7) were identified in CSN3*F1 and CSN3*G2, respectively. 3ainhibitory concentration 50 3akappa-casein 3abioactive properties 3apeptidyl-dipeptidase A 3apeptides 3aamino acid sequences 3aenzyme inhibitors 3amilk 3agenotype 3agenetic variation 0aenzymes 0amolecular sequence data1 aMeisel, H.1 aErhardt, G.0 tJournal of dairy science.g2009 May, v. 92, no. 5 p.1885-1888dAmerican Dairy Science Associationx0022-03027nnas  aDNAL  a20090625b20090703c00000000  aINDd2CTe2009/05/28  aOther US 7aarticle04353naa a2200685 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003100111040001800142072000900160100001700169245007000186300001800256500002400274520228500298650001502583650001102598650002302609650001302632650001402645650002102659650002002680650001302700650001602713650001402729650001502743650002102758650001902779650000902798650001202807650002302819650003602842650003302878650001102911650002802922650004802950650004502998650002603043650007103069650003303140650003603173650001703209653002003226653001503246653002303261700002303284700001803307700001703325700001703342700001603359773011903375852000903494856008103503930003303584945002503617946001303642655001203655IND4419578320221119114132.0090424e200905  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441957832DNAL7 a193899572pmid7 a10.3168/jds.2008-16432doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL6001 aTremblay, G.10aLocal control of mammary involution: Is stanniocalcin-1 involved?  ap. 1998-2006.  aIncludes references  aThere is considerable evidence to indicate the existence of local control of mammary gland involution, but the exact nature of this control has yet to be defined. Stanniocalcin-1 (STC-1) is a newly discovered mammalian hormone that seems involved in the lactation process and may be implicated in the control of involution. As a first step in investigating this hypothesis, the change in STC-1 levels in milk and serum was measured during drying off. Nine Holstein cows in late lactation were milked twice daily on half the gland, while the other half was left unmilked for a 14-d period. Milk and blood samples and mammary biopsies were taken on d -7, 1, 2, 7, and 14 relative to the onset of the nonmilking period. The concentrations of STC-1 in serum and milk were determined by RIA. The albumin concentration and proteinase activity of the milk were determined. Apoptosis of the mammary epithelium was quantified by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling assay. Finally, the effects of milk on cellular activity and apoptosis were tested in vitro on mammary epithelial cells by measuring the turnover of tetrazolium salts and by counting the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling-positive cells. The drying off of 2 quarters increased the milk production of the quarters that were milked by 30%. Milk proteinase activity and BSA and STC-1 concentrations increased in the nonmilked quarters, but remained unchanged in the milked quarters. Moreover, at d 2, the apoptotic rate of the mammary cells was higher in the nonmilked quarters than in the milked quarters (0.22 ± 0.04 vs. 0.07 ± 0.04%, respectively). Finally, in vitro experimentation demonstrated that mammary epithelial cells cultured in the presence of milk from involuting quarters had 3-fold more apoptotic cells as compared with those cultured in milk from the milked quarters at d 14. The metabolic rate was reduced by 14.6% for milk from d 7 and 23.6% for milk from d 14. Interestingly, the metabolic rate was negatively correlated with the STC-1 concentration in milk (r = -0.65). This study shows for the first time that STC-1 in milk is increased following milk stasis, although its exact role in the involution process remains to be clarified. 3adairy cows 3audders 3amammary involution 3ahormones 3alactation 3amilk composition 3ablood chemistry 3aalbumins 3aproteinases 3aapoptosis 3aepithelium 3ain vitro studies 3acultured cells 3amilk 2aAnimals 2aBiopsyxveterinary 2aCattlexmetabolismxphysiology. 2aEpithelial Cellsxmetabolism 2aFemale 2aGelatinasesxmetabolism 2aGlycoproteinsxanalysisxbloodxmetabolism. 2aInsulin-Like Growth Factor Ixmetabolism 2aLactationxphysiology 2aMammary Glands, Animalxcytologyxmetabolismxphysiologyxsurgery. 2aMilkxchemistryxenzymology. 2aSerum Albumin, Bovinexanalysis 2aTime Factors 0astanniocalcin-1 0adrying off 0amammary epithelium1 aBernier-Dodier, P.1 aDelbecchi, L.1 aWagner, G.F.1 aTalbot, B.G.1 aLacasse, P.0 tJournal of dairy science.g2009 May, v. 92, no. 5 p.1998-2006dAmerican Dairy Science Associationx0022-03027nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3168/jds.2008-16433Available from publisher's Web site  a20090624b20090703c00000000  aINDd2CTe2009/05/28  aOther US 7aarticle03011naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100002300128245009900151300001600250500001500266520158200281650002301863650000901886650001701895650001101912650001201923650001201935650000901947650001501956650001201971650002801983650001602011650003702027650000902064650001102073650001302084650002602097650004002123650000902163650002202172650002202194650000902216650002502225650003702250653000902287700002102296700001802317773007902335852000902414939003302423946001302456655001202469IND9004410320221119114150.0900912e199007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND900441032DNAL7 a23661102pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGarcia-Lopez, J.S.10aIron retention by rats from casein-legume test meals: effect of tannin level and previous diet  ap. 760-766.  a2019-12-04  aThe effect of tannin content on iron (Fe) bioavailability from several legumes was evaluated. Absorption of Fe from a casein (C), isolated soy protein (ISP), chickpea (CP) or red kidney bean (RKB) test meal was tested in marginally Fe-deficient rats [19.9 +/- 0.2 9 Hb/100 mL (mean +/- SD)] using the extrinsic tag technique. Also, the effects of a casein habitual diet or of one of three casein-legume habitual diets fed before and after the test meal were investigated. Weanling male rats were fed the habitual diets containing 23 +/- 4 mg Fe/kg of diet (range 17-28) for 13 d. On d 14, after an overnight fast, rats were fed the test meal (1.5 g + 0.1 microCi 59Fe), and whole-body radioactivity was determined. The same habitual diet was refed for seven additional days, and whole-body radioactivity was determined again. Rats retained more iron from C (86%) than from ISP, CP or RKB test meals (73%, 75% and 67%, respectively) when the respective casein-legume habitual diets were fed before and after the test meals. With the casein habitual diet, there was no difference in retained iron from C, ISP, CP or RKB test meals (86%, 87%, 83% and 82%, respectively). Retention of iron from an RKB test meal was increased from 69.6 to 73% when about 90% of the extractable tannins were removed, but the difference was not statistically significant. Thus, feeding a casein-legume diet but not a casein diet prior to a test meal apparently predisposes the rat to lower iron absorption. However, in these studies, tannins per se did not significantly depress iron bioavailability. 3anutritional status 3airon 3adiet history 3acasein 3atannins 3alegumes 3arats 2aAbsorption 2aAnimals 2aBiological Availability 2aBody Weight 2aCaseinsxadministration & dosage 2aDiet 2aEating 2aFabaceae 2aHemoglobinsxanalysis 2aIronxdeficiencyxpharmacokinetics. 2aMale 2aPlants, Medicinal 2aRandom Allocation 2aRats 2aRats, Inbred Strains 2aTanninsxadministration & dosage 0adiet1 aErdman, J.W.

Some guinea pigs were fed ad libitum a purified diet deficient in vitamin A (VAD group) until biochemical signs of deficiency occurred. A second, control group (VA group) received the same diet as well as 100 IU vitamin A daily by pharyngeal tube. Cochlear potentials were recorded by special computerized equipment using implanted electrodes. Before acoustic stimulation, a baseline value was determined with a test stimulus [90 dBA (A-filter according to usual DIN instructions)] corresponding to that for TTS measurements. Noise-induced changes were determined by calculating the changes in latency and amplitude of the N1-signal of the compound action potential (CAP) at various times (1, 3, 5, 7, 11 min) after termination of acoustic stimulation in comparison with baseline values. Statistical analysis of the CAP data showed that the VAD group had significantly smaller amplitudes and increased latency of the N1-potential after acoustic stimulation and that the VA group did not show a significant change in amplitude or latency. The reduction in N1-amplitude and N1-latency in the VAD group reflects changes in inner ear hair cell activity. We conclude that vitamin A deficiency increases the sensitivity of the inner ear to noise and that this increased sensitivity increases the probability of noise-induced hearing loss. 3adiet 3avitamin deficiencies 3avitamin A 3asounds 3aguinea pigs 3abiological resistance 2aAcoustic Stimulation 2aAnalysis of Variance 2aAnimals 2aAudiometry, Evoked Response 2aAuditory Threshold 2aChromatography, High Pressure Liquid 2aElectrodes, Implanted 2aEvoked Potentials, Auditory 2aGuinea Pigs 2aHearing Loss, Noise-Inducedxetiology 2aMale 2aNoisexadverse effects 2aRandom Allocation 2aSignal Processing, Computer-Assisted 2aVitamin A Deficiencyxcomplications1 aWellner, U.1 aWeiser, H.0 tJournal of nutrition.g1990 July, v. 120, no. 7 p.726-737x0022-31667nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02483naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100002400129245012400153300001600277500001500293520107500308650002201383650001201405650001201417650001201429650001001441650001601451650002401467650001301491650001901504650001301523650001201536650001801548650004801566650002101614650001101635650002201646650002801668653001601696653001501712653001201727653001801739653001501757653001301772700001601785773008601801852000901887930003301896945001301929946001101942655001201953IND2331952820221119114151.0030411e200302  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233195282DNAL7 a127700052pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPszczolkowski, M.A.10aChilling affects allatal cell proliferation via antennae and protocerebral neurons in the cockroach Diploptera punctata  ap. 123-129.  a2019-12-05  aThe corpora allata (CA) cells in a mated female of the cockroach Diploptera punctata undergo numerous mitotic divisions before an increase in juvenile hormone synthesis. A previous study demonstrated that this mitotic wave could be suppressed by exposure of the mated female to melting ice. Herein, we report that chilling suppresses CA mitosis via antennal perception. Cell proliferation-suppressing stimuli from chilling were acquired in proportion to the length of time of exposure to the low temperature and the physical length of the antennae exposed to chilling. Sixty basal antennal annuli should remain exposed to chilling for at least 1.5 h in order to suppress mitotic divisions in CA. Mitotic divisions in corpus allatum are suppressed by stimuli from contralateral antenna, predominantly via pars intercerebralis neurons. Selective disconnection of pars intercerebralis neurons from CA, prior to chilling, restored the mitotic wave in CA. Cellular divisions did not occur in CA of chilled females if either pars lateralis neurons were severed or left intact. 3asensory receptors 3amitosis 3aneurons 3acooling 3abrain 3acold stress 3aDiploptera punctata 3aduration 3acorpora allata 3aantennae 2aAnimals 2aCell Division 2aCockroachesxanatomy & histologyxcytology. 2aCold Temperature 2aFemale 2aNeuronsxcytology 2aTelencephalonxcytology 0adenervation 0aperception 0astimuli 0acell division 0ainhibition 0aablation1 aBrown, J.J.0 tJournal of insect physiology.g2003 Feb., v. 49, no. 2 p.123-129x0022-19107nnas  aDNAL  a20030508b20030509c00000000  aINDdNZM  aNon-US 7aarticle01877naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001100110245009600121300001600217520100700233650002201240650002401262650001701286650001801303650002001321653002401341653001101365700001901376773010001395852000901495930003301504945001301537946001301550655001201563IND2199886220221119113945.0990726e199901  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND219988622DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, G.10aControls of sediment transport capacity in laminar interrill flow on stone-covered surfaces  ap. 305-310.  aSediment transport capacity is an important control on soil erosion and deposition by overland flow. To investigate the controls of transport capacity in laminar interrill overland flow on stone-covered surfaces, 357 flume experiments were performed using a single sediment size. Multiple regression analyses reveal that transport capacity is positively related to excess flow power omega - omega c, but the slope of the relation is steeper where omega < 0.3 W m-2 than where omega greater than or equal to 0.3 W m-2. Transport capacity is positively related to rainfall intensity where omega < 0.3 W m-2 and negatively related to rainfall intensity where omega greater than or equal to 0.3 W m-2. Transport capacity is negatively related to stone concentration and positively related to stone size irrespective of the value of omega. Finally, transport capacity is negatively related to fluid viscosity where omega < 0.3 W m-2 and unrelated to viscosity where omega greater than or equal to 0.3 W m-2. 3ainterrill erosion 3asediment deposition 3alaminar flow 3aoverland flow 3aerosion control 0amultiple regression 0astones1 aAbrahams, A.D.0 tWater resources research.g1999 Jan., v. 35, no. 1 p.305-310wJournal:jnl46306x0043-13977nnas  aDNAL  a19990901b19990909c00000000  aINDdGHK  aOther US 7aarticle02373naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001700152245009500169300001600264500002400280520129800304650001901602650001501621650001801636650001801654650001301672650002201685650002301707650001901730650001801749650002201767700001701789700002201806773011901828852000901947856005501956655001202011IND4394757220221119114025.0070906e200710  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439475722DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1745-4530.2007.00131.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKaya, Ahmet.10aConcentration boundary conditions in the theoretical analysis of convective drying process  ap. 564-577.  aIncludes references  aIn the theoretical analysis of convective drying process, two boundary conditions are common for concentration: constant concentration and convection. In this study, these two boundary conditions were comparatively examined by comparing theoretical results obtained with regard to experimental ones. Pumpkin (Cucurbita pepo) was considered as the product to be dried while air was the drying medium. The drying characteristics of pumpkin were determined for various values of drying air parameters, including temperature, velocity and relative humidity. Sorption isotherms of the dried pumpkin were also determined for different temperatures and water activities. The values of the effective moisture diffusivity, Deff, and the convective mass transfer coefficient, hm, were predicted, and these values were found to agree fairly well with those available in the existing literature. Convective drying as well as other drying techniques are used in order to preserve and store agricultural products for longer periods by removing some of their moisture content. Drying is a complicated process involving simultaneous heat and mass transfer under transient conditions. Understanding the heat and mass transfer in the product will help to improve drying process parameters and hence the quality. 3aCucurbita pepo 3aair drying 3aheat transfer 3amass transfer 3apumpkins 3arelative humidity 3asorption isotherms 3awater activity 3awater content 3awater temperature1 aAYDIN, ORHAN1 aDEMIRTAŞ, CEVDET0 tJournal of food process engineering.g2007 Oct., v. 30, no. 5 p.564-577dBlackwell Publishing Incx0145-88767nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1745-4530.2007.00131.x 7aarticle03924naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127072000900145072000900154100001400163245018100177300001300358500002400371500001500395520221600410650002602626650002102652650001302673650002102686650002702707650002102734650002102755650000902776650001602785650001802801650002002819650003102839650002502870650001802895650001602913653001602929653001402945700001802959700002002977700001902997700001603016700001903032700001903051700001803070773009503088852000903183856008503192930003303277945002503310946001103335655001203346IND4419553620221119114019.0090424e20090504xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441955362DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jep.2009.02.0452doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aS200 0aX3801 aKang, Hee10aUpregulation of interferon-γ and interleukin-4, Th cell-derived cytokines by So-Shi-Ho-Tang (Sho-Saiko-To) occurs at the level of antigen presenting cells, but not CD4 T cells  ap. 6-14.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aEthnopharmacological relevance: So-Shi-Ho-Tang (SSHT) or known as Sho-Saiko-To in Japanese and Xiao-Chai-Hu-Tang in Chinese has been used to treat chronic liver disease and other infections, and its hepatoprotective effects have been widely studied. Aim of the study: We tried to investigate the immunomodulatory effect of SSHT on interferon (IFN)-γ and interleukin (IL)-4 and their Th1/Th2 transcription factors in vivo and in vitro since these two cytokines are important in determining the type of cell-mediated inflammatory and humoral responses. Materials and methods: SSHT was orally given to BALB/c mice for 7 days and then injected with anti-CD3 mAb intravenously. IFN-γ, IL-4, IL-2 and Th1/Th2-specific transcription factors as well as splenocyte subsets were measured. Splenocytes and CD4 T cells were cultured with anti-CD3 or anti-CD3/anti-CD28 in the presence of SSHT, its constituent herbs and baicalin, and the levels of cytokines and transcription factors were measured by ELISA and western blotting. Results: Oral administration of SSHT to mice in response to i.v. anti-CD3 injection enhanced the expression of IFN-γ, IL-4 and IL-2 in the serum and spleen at the secreted protein and mRNA level. This was accompanied by the upregulation of CD69 and CD4 T cell populations by flow cytometry. The upregulation of IFN-γ and IL-4 by SSHT did not occur in anti-CD3/anti-CD28 stimulated CD4 T cells in vitro. However, SSHT was capable of producing the cytokines in anti-CD3 stimulated splenocytes even in the absence of CD28, suggesting a role for some soluble factors produced by antigen presenting cells (APC). In support of this, we found that SSHT increased IL-12 and IL-6 in the same cells. STAT4, but not T-bet, was involved in the upregulation of IFN-γ by SSHT while the increased IL-4 expression was accompanied by a parallel increase in c-Maf but independent of STAT6 and GATA-3. Conclusion: These data indicate that the upregulation of IFN-γ and IL-4 by SSHT must occur through some interactions between APC and CD4 T cells. Taken together, the present data provide additional information on some of the immunological mechanisms of SSHT for treatment of liver diseases and infections. 3atranscription factors 3ain vitro studies 3aantigens 3ahumoral immunity 3acell-mediated immunity 3aimmunomodulators 3aherbal medicines 3amice 3asplenocytes 3aanimal models 3aimmune response 3aCD4-positive T-lymphocytes 3amedicinal properties 3ainterleukin-4 3ainterferons 0alymphocytes 0acytokines1 aChoi, Tae-Won1 aAhn, Kyoo Seok.1 aLee, Ju Young.1 aHam, In-Hye1 aChoi, Ho-Young1 aShim, Eun-Sheb1 aSohn, Nak-Won0 tJournal of ethnopharmacology.g2009 May 4, v. 123, no. 1 p.6-14dElsevierx0378-87417nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jep.2009.02.0453Available from publisher's Web site  a20090911b20091002c00000000  aINDd2CTe2009/08/13  aNon-US 7aarticle03193naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002300094024004200117040001800159100001800177245006700195300001600262500011200278520144300390650001901833650001701852650001301869650002301882650001401905650001801919650002301937650001101960650002201971650001101993650001202004650001102016650002302027650002302050650001102073650001502084650001002099700001302109700001302122700004802135700001502183700001702198700001502215700002402230700001402254700001702268700002002285773014402305856005502449856011402504852000902618655001202627IND60697303520221119114041.0200604e20191108xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069730352DNAL7 a10113/69730352hdl7 a10.17660/ActaHortic.2019.1256.412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHunter, P.

However, such products have increased perishability resulting in high wastage. Many leafy vegetables and fruits are susceptible to discolouration, and breeding crop varieties with reduced propensity to discolour offers a cost effective solution as growing them has no added costs. This project facilitates a genetic approach to controlling postharvest discolouration by developing an understanding of the genetics and biochemistry of discolouration and providing underpinning knowledge to allow exploitation of quantitative natural variation in the development of discolouration whilst maintaining other traits (e.g., disease resistance, taste, etc.) at acceptable levels. We have observed that a lettuce (Lactuca sativa) recombinant inbred population from 'Saladin' × 'Iceberg' segregates into two Iceberg and Cos head morphotypes. Levels of phenolics in the leaves are associated with morphotype and processed and bagged leaves from the population show a general negative association between pinking and browning symptoms. Discolouration traits exhibit genotypic variation allowing the identification of breeding material to develop lines with improved postharvest quality. A better understanding of the biochemical variation has the potential to lead to specific treatments that could be applied during processing to reduce discolouration development and increase shelf life. 3aLactuca sativa 3abiochemistry 3abreeding 3acost effectiveness 3acultivars 3adiscoloration 3adisease resistance 3afruits 3agenetic variation 3aleaves 3alettuce 3amorphs 3aphenolic compounds 3aready-to-eat foods 3asalads 3ashelf life 3ataste1 aPink, D.1 aHand, P.1 aHeath, Johnc(Principal scientific officer)1 aBarker, G.1 aHambidge, A.1 aLignou, S.1 aOruna-Concha, M.

M. avenae feeding on infected wheat had a significantly shorter (P less than or equal to 0.05) developmental time, a greater fecundity, and a greater intrinsic rate of natural increase (rm) than aphids feeding on noninfected plants. These results suggest that BYDV and M. avenae interact for their mutual benefit, resulting in a higher potential for population growth of the virus and the vector. The wheat cultivar 'Caldwell' was found in this and previous studies to have a degree of tolerance to BYDV as indicated by milder symptoms. Resistance to virus production also was detected for the P-PAV-infected 'Caldwell' wheat, which had significantly lower ELISA values (i.e., lower virus concentration) than 'Abe' wheat. M. avenae also had a significantly reduced fecundity on 'Caldwell' compared with that on 'Abe' and 'Talento' wheats infected with BYDV. No significant differences were observed in M. avenae fecundity on BYDV-free cultivars. The results suggest that infection with BYDV might improve the nutritional quality of wheat to M. avenae, resulting in changes in the fecundity of the vector. These changes were greater with the BYDV-sensitive 'Abe' and 'Talento' cultivars than with the tolerant 'Caldwell' wheat cultivar. 3aTriticum aestivum 3aSitobion avenae 3afecundity 3acultivars 0adevelopment 0abarley yellow dwarf luteovirus1 aLister, R.M.1 aAraya, J.E.1 aFoster, J.E.0 tEnvironmental entomology.g1989 June, v. 18, no. 3 p.388-393x0046-225X7nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle01923naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001500110245006700125300001800192500001500210520079800225650002301023650001301046650001401059650001101073650002501084650001501109650001201124653002401136653002401160653000901184653001701193653002401210653003201234653003301266653001501299700001601314773010301330852000901433930003301442945001301475946001301488655001201501IND2198075520221119114004.0990412e199810  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND219807552DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStreck, T.10aOn field-scale dispersion of strongly sorbing solutes in soils  ap. 2769-2773.  a2019-12-05  aThe practical application of parallel soil column (or stream tube) models is hindered by the difficulty to assess the probability density function of the pore water velocity, which at present requires extensive measurements. However, many environmentally relevant chemicals are strongly sorbed to the soil matrix. In this case, solute transport can be modeled to a good approximation on the basis of the pdf of infiltration and a constant water content. The exact value of the water content and its variability are not important. This follows from analysis of the travel time moments of a generalized multicompartment model and is shown to hold true for kinetic sorption to an arbitrary number of arbitrarily connected sorbent compartments with different equilibrium partitioning coefficients. 3asoil water content 3asorption 3aequations 3amodels 3aprobability analysis 3awater flow 3asolutes 0aheterogeneous soils 0apore water velocity 0asoil 0ainfiltration 0atransport processes 0aparallel soil column models 0aprobability density function 0adispersion1 aPiehler, H.0 tWater resources research.g1998 Oct., v. 34, no. 10 p.2769-2773wJournal:jnl46306x0043-13977nnas  aDNAL  a19990503b19990512c00000000  aINDdGHK  aOther US 7aarticle03123naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004400092040001800136100001600154245009300170300001600263500002400279520164900303650001501952650002101967650001501988650001202003650001802015650001802033650002002051650001302071650002202084650002102106650001502127650003702142650001102179651001202190653001702202700001602219700002002235700001502255773014702270852000902417856009402426856006202520930003302582945001302615946001302628655001202641IND2062336320221119113939.0980310e199706  vau|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206233632DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1752-1688.1997.tb03541.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGupta, R.K.10aSurface water quality impacts of tillage practices under liquid swine manure application  ap. 681-687.  aIncludes references  aField studies were conducted to investigate the effects of tillage practices on the saturated hydraulic conductivity, and quantity and quality of surface runoff water resulting from the application ofthe liquid swine manure as a fertilizer. As part of the study, infiltration experiments were conducted on silt-loam soil with no-tillage (NT) and disk tillage (DT) practices. Liquid swine manure was applied on test plots, and the rainfall was applied by the portable rainfall simulator. The infiltration data was analyzed for the saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ks) and runoff volume determinations. The surface runoff water was analyzed for total N, total P, ammonia, and nitrate concentration determinations. The study indicated that the tillage had significant effects on Ks, and quantity and quality of runoff water. The Ks values of the NT plots were found to vary from 0.693 to 1.734 mm/min, with a mean of 1.494 mm/min, while they varied from 1.056 to 2.543 mm/min, with a mean of 2.231 mm/min in the DT plots. The total N, total P, ammonium nitrogen and nitrate nitrogen concentrations were lower in runoff generated from DT plots, compared to that from the NT plots. The chemical concentration levels were significantly different in runoff waters collected one-day after manure application than in those collected 40-days after the manure application. Study suggested that the DT practice must be preferred over the NT practice if liquid swine manure is used as the fertilizer. The study is further continued to assess the long-term impacts of swine manure application and tillage on the quantity and quality of surface runoff water. 3apig manure 3aland application 3ano-tillage 3adiscing 3asurface water 3awater quality 3awater pollution 3anitrogen 3aammonium nitrogen 3anitrate nitrogen 3aphosphorus 3asaturated hydraulic conductivity 3arunoff 3aOntario 0ainfiltration1 aRudra, R.P.1 aDickinson, W.T.1 aWall, G.J.0 tJournal of the American Water Resources Association.g1997 June, v. 33, no. 3 p.681-687dAmerican Water Resources Associationx1093-474X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1752-1688.1997.tb03541.x3Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://www.awra.org/jawra/index.html3electronic resource  a20050421b20050501c00000000  aINDdGHK  aOther US 7aarticle03533naa a2200661 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100002200129245015700151300001400308500001500322520165600337650001401993650002302007650001902030650000902049650001202058650002502070650001302095650002002108650002102128650002102149650001902170650001202189650001002201650001802211650002702229650001502256650002002271650001202291650003802303650001302341650003502354650002402389650004302413650002402456650002702480653002202507653001502529653001902544653001502563653002802578653001302606653002402619653001402643700001702657700002102674700001402695773008402709852000902793930003302802945001302835946001102848655001202859IND2331464420221119113944.0030318e200301  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233146442DNAL7 a127700142pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchofield, R.M.S.10aZinc is incorporated into cuticular "tools" after ecdysis: the time course of the zinc distribution in "tools" and whole bodies of an ant and a scorpion  ap. 31-44.  a2019-12-05  aAn understanding of the developmental course of specialized accumulations in the cuticular "tools" of arthropods will give clues to the chemical form, function and biology of these accumulations as well as to their evolutionary history. Specimens from individuals representing a range of developmental stages were examined using MeV - Ion microscopy. We found that zinc, manganese, calcium and chlorine began to accumulate in the mandibular teeth of the ant Tapinoma sessile after pre-ecdysial tanning, and the zinc mostly after eclosion; peak measured zinc concentrations reached 16% of dry mass. Accumulations in the pedipalp teeth, tarsal claws, cheliceral teeth and sting (aculeus) of the scorpion Vaejovis spinigeris also began after pre-ecdysial tanning and more than 48 h after ecdysis of the second instars. Zinc may be deposited in the fully formed cuticle through a network of nanometer scale canals that we observed only in the metal bearing cuticle of both the ants and scorpions. In addition to the elemental analyses of cuticular "tools", quantitative distribution maps for whole ants were obtained. The zinc content of the mandibular teeth was a small fraction of, and independent of, the total body content of zinc. We did not find specialized storage sites that were depleted when zinc was incorporated into the mandibular teeth. The similarities in the time course of zinc, manganese and calcium deposition in the cuticular "tools" of the ant (a hexapod arthropod) and those of the scorpion (a chelicerate arthropod) contribute to the evidence suggesting that heavy metal - halogen fortification evolved before these groups diverged. 3amanganese 3atemporal variation 3amineralization 3azinc 3acalcium 3adevelopmental stages 3achlorine 3amineral content 3aTapinoma sessile 3abody composition 3aanimal cuticle 3aecdysis 3aclaws 3acalcification 3abiological development 3aScorpiones 3asting apparatus 2aAnimals 2aAntsxphysiologyxultrastructure. 2aKinetics 2aMicroscopy, Electron, Scanning 2aMoltingxphysiology 2aScorpionsxphysiologyxultrastructure. 2aTissue Distribution 2aZincxpharmacokinetics 0abiomineralization 0adeposition 0ascorpion teeth 0abody parts 0acentruroides exilicauda 0aTapinoma 0avaejovis spinigeris 0aant teeth1 aNesson, M.H.1 aRichardson, K.A.1 aWyeth, P.0 tJournal of insect physiology.g2003 Jan., v. 49, no. 1 p.31-44x0022-19107nnas  aDNAL  a20030401b20030408c00000000  aINDdNZM  aNon-US 7aarticle01835naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245007000127300001800197520089300215650001901108650002101127650001701148650001401165650001701179653001501196653002801211653002301239700001901262700001701281700001601298773010301314852000901417930003301426945001301459946001301472655001201485IND2198073520221119113852.0990412e199810  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND219807352DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMiller, C.T.10aRobust solution of Richards' equation for nonuniform porous media  ap. 2599-2610.  aCapillary pressure-saturation-relative permeability relations described using the van Genuchten [1980] and Mualem [1976] models for nonuniform porous media lead to numerical convergence difficulties when used with Richards' equation for certain auxiliary conditions. These difficulties arise because of discontinuities in the derivative of specific moisture capacity and relative permeability as a function of capillary pressure. Convergence difficulties are illustrated using standard numerical approaches to simulate such problems. We investigate constitutive relations, interblock permeability, nonlinear algebraic system approximation methods, and two time integration approaches. An integral permeability approach approximated by Hermite polynomials is recommended and shown to be robust and economical for a set of test problems, which correspond to sand, loam, and clay loam media. 3asaturated flow 3aunsaturated flow 3apermeability 3aequations 3aporous media 0asaturation 0avariably saturated flow 0acapillary pressure1 aWilliams, G.A.1 aKelley, C.T.1 aTocci, M.D.0 tWater resources research.g1998 Oct., v. 34, no. 10 p.2599-2610wJournal:jnl46306x0043-13977nnas  aDNAL  a19990503b19990512c00000000  aINDdGHK  aOther US 7aarticle02722naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001400110245017200124300001600296500001500312520126900327650002101596650001801617650001201635650002301647650001101670650002301681650001701704650002001721653001601741653002401757653001401781653002501795653001501820653004001835653001201875653002301887653002701910653001301937653001401950653002301964700001801987700001502005700001702020700001502037773008602052852000902138930003302147945001302180946001102193655001202204IND2330432920221119114221.0030116e200208  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233043292DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHoste, B.12aA comparison of phase-related shifts in behavior and morphometrics of an albino strain, deficient in [His7]-corazonin, and a normally colored Locusta migratoria strain  ap. 791-801.  a2019-12-05  aThe albino Okinawa strain of Locusta migratoria is deficient in the neurohormone [His(7)]-corazonin. This peptide induces darkening of the cuticle, one of the typical features of gregarious locusts. As part of a broader study on the possible role of [His(7)]corazonin in phase transition, we explored whether corazonin-deficiency might be associated with differences in behavior and morphometrics between albino and normal phenotypes of L. migratoria. Using a modification of the logistic-regression assay of behavioral phase state previously derived for Schistocerca gregaria, we found that there were strain dependant behavioral differences between crowd-reared nymphs of the albino Okinawa and the normally colored African strain, with no evidence of the albino strain being obligatorily solitarious. However, upon isolation, a shift towards more solitarious behavior occurs in both strains, even more profoundly in the Okinawa albinos. A shift could also be recorded in morphometrics. The conclusion is that the albino strain, although showing some solitarious features even when crowd-reared, is not, as has been suggested, obligatory solitarious and, as a consequence, the complete absence of corazonin is not sufficient to bring about the solitarious state. 3aphase transition 3aneurohormones 3alocusts 3astrain differences 3aalbino 3aLocusta migratoria 3apolymorphism 3abehavior change 0aaggregation 0adark pigmentotropin 0aphenotype 0acorazonin deficiency 0adeficiency 0agregarious vs. solitarious behavior 0aalbinos 0aphase polymorphism 0aanatomy and morphology 0acrowding 0aisolation 0aarthropod hormones1 aSimpson, S.J.1 aTanaka, S.1 aLoof, A. de.1 aBreuer, M.0 tJournal of insect physiology.g2002 Aug., v. 48, no. 8 p.791-801x0022-19107nnas  aDNAL  a20030304b20030311c00000000  aINDdNZM  aNon-US 7aarticle03890naa a2200673 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003100111040001800142072000900160072000900169072000900178100001500187245012600202300001800328500002400346500001500370520176500385650002002150650002302170650002302193650001502216650003102231650002102262650001702283650002202300650003802322650001302360650002302373650002002396650001702416650004802433650001502481650001902496650001202515650004902527650001302576650001102589650006802600650001102668650002302679650000902702650006002711650006902771651001202840651002702852653001302879700001502892700001602907773012002923852000903043856008103052930003303133945002503166946001303191655001203204IND4408261620221119114049.0080726e200808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440826162DNAL7 a186503012pmid7 a10.3168/jds.2008-10212doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL832 0aL810 0aL2001 aHinger, M.10aHeritability Estimates for Antibody Response to Mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis in German Holstein Cattle  ap. 3237-3244.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe objective of this study was to estimate heritability of antibody response to Mycobacterium avium ssp. paratuberculosis (MAP) in 4,524 German Holstein cows by applying linear and threshold models. Data were collected within a paratuberculosis voluntary control program in Thuringia, Germany, in 2005. The MAP-positive prevalence of the 12 farms in the data set varied between 5 and 36.9%. A nearly linear increase in prevalence was observed from 2- to 3-yr-old cows, whereas prevalence declined in cows older than 5 yr. This could be explained by greater culling rates associated with increasing age. Classification as MAP positive, questionable, and negative was available for all cows, and the optical density values of the Svanovir ELISA test existed for 2,084 of the animals originating from 6 farms. The heritability estimates of linear and threshold animal and sire models were compared. For the available data sets with an average of 8 progeny per sire, animal models were more robust and yielded more reliable results than did sire models. Heritability estimates from sire models led to overestimation of genetic variances because of a low number of progeny per sire and average relationship within sire progeny of greater than one-fourth, as expected between half-sibs. For all animal models, a heritability of about 0.1 was estimated for antibody response to MAP. Furthermore, it can be concluded that for the estimation of breeding values for antibody response to MAP optical density values of the ELISA test as a normally distributed trait (log-transformed) should be used rather than MAP status (positive or negative) as a binary trait because of the greater heritability and more robust parameter estimates when sire or animal models are used. 3acattle diseases 3agenetic resistance 3adisease prevalence 3aantibodies 3aanimal pathogenic bacteria 3aparatuberculosis 3adairy cattle 3aculling (animals) 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3aHolstein 3adisease resistance 3aimmune response 3aheritability 3aMycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis 3aanimal age 3abreeding value 2aAnimals 2aAntibodies, Bacterialxgeneticsximmunology. 2aBreeding 2aCattle 2aCattle Diseasesxdiagnosisxepidemiologyxgeneticsximmunology. 2aFemale 2aHeredityxgenetics 2aMale 2aMycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosisximmunology 2aParatuberculosisxdiagnosisxepidemiologyxgeneticsximmunology. 3aGermany 0aGermanyxepidemiology. 0aimmunity1 aBrandt, H.1 aErhardt, G.0 tJournal of dairy science.g2008 Aug., v. 91, no. 8 p.3237-3244dAmerican Dairy Science Associationx0022-03027nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3168/jds.2008-10213Available from publisher's Web site  a20081023b20081101c00000000  aINDd2CTe2008/10/07  aOther US 7aarticle03006naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002500111040001800136100002300154245015600177300001400333500002400347520146000371650003001831650001301861650001101874650001301885650001501898650001101913650001401924650001401938650002501952650001301977650001001990650001602000650001302016650001302029650001202042650003502054650001402089650001102103650002802114650001302142650000902155650004102164650001602205650002602221700001802247700001502265700002102280773010402301852000902405856003802414655001202452IND4451235120221119114233.0110322e201101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445123512DNAL7 a209541692pmid7 a10.1002/ps.20352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuarino, Salvatore10aResponses of Rhynchophorus ferrugineus adults to selected synthetic palm esters: electroantennographic studies and trap catches in an urban environment  ap. 77-81.  aIncludes references  aBACKGROUND: The red palm weevil (RPW), Rhynchophorus ferrugineus Olivier, accidentally introduced into the European countries facing the Mediterranean basin, is becoming the most serious pest for ornamental palms in the urban environment. In the present work, tests were conducted on the electroantennogram (EAG) and behavioural responses of RPW adults to five selected synthetic palm esters, ethyl propionate, ethyl butyrate, ethyl isobutyrate, ethyl lactate and ethyl acetate, to assess the application of a mass trapping technique in an urban environment. RESULTS: In the laboratory, EAG bioassays on RPW adults with the synthetic palm esters showed: (1) positive dose‐dependent responses; (2) differences among the treatments; (3) a greater response to ethyl propionate; (4) a higher sensitivity of female antennae compared with male antennae. In the urban environment, RPW behavioural responses, evaluated over six biweekly observations on pheromone‐ and molasses‐ baited traps, showed that more adults were caught by traps supplemented with ethyl propionate and ethyl acetate than by traps supplemented with only ethyl propionate. Similar catches were recorded in the traps supplemented with ethyl propionate or ethyl acetate. CONCLUSION: This study supports the application of the mass trapping implemented with synthetic palm esters as a potential tool for the management of RPW populations to protect ornamental palms in urban environments. 3aRhynchophorus ferrugineus 3aacetates 3aadults 3aantennae 3abait traps 3abasins 3abioassays 3abutyrates 3aelectroantennography 3alactates 3apests 3apropionates 3atrapping 2aAcetates 2aAnimals 2aBehavior, Animalxdrug effects 2aButyrates 2aFemale 2aInsect Controlxmethods 2aLactates 2aMale 2aPheromonesxchemistryxpharmacology. 2aPropionates 2aWeevilsxdrug effects1 aBue, Paolo Lo1 aPeri, Ezio1 aColazza, Stefano0 tPest management science.g2011 Jan., v. 67, no. 1 p.77-81dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.x1526-498X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ps.2035 7aarticle03361naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134072000900152072000900161100001500170245008300185300001600268500002400284500001500308520205900323650002802382650002702410650001302437650002002450650001602470650001902486650000702505650001902512650002002531650002202551650002702573651002102600653001702621773010502638852000902743856009202752930003302844945002502877946001302902655001202915IND4419491120221119114102.0090424e200905  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441949112DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1745-4565.2009.00154.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ121 0aQ2011 aDurmaz, H.10aFate of Listeria monocytogenes in Carra cheese during manufacture and ripening  ap. 253-260.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aCarra cheese produced from raw milk is a traditional cheese that contains mostly black cumin (Nigella sativa) and is produced in the Southeastern provinces of Turkey. This study was carried out to evaluate the growth and survival of Listeria monocytogenes during manufacture and ripening of Carra cheese. For this purpose, Carra cheese was produced with raw cow's milk inoculated to contain 2.97 log cfu/mL of L. monocytogenes (serovar 4b). Cheese was ripened through storing in an earthenware jug underground for 90 days. Enumeration of L. monocytogenes was made by surface-plating on Oxford agar. The number of L. monocytogenes increased during manufacture and reached 4.89 log cfu/g at the first day of ripening, while it decreased to 4.19 log cfu/g during the first 15 days of ripening and remained constant throughout the rest of the ripening period. The results indicated that L. monocytogenes in Carra cheese manufactured with raw milk was able to survive for 90 days of ripening despite low pH and the presence of a high number of lactic acid bacteria. Thus, Listeria-contaminated Carra cheese could cause serious illness if consumed by susceptible individuals. Behaviour of L. monocytogenes during manufacture and ripening of different types of cheese in several countries should be studied in order to determine the exact risk that this food represents to food safety. Considering the processing method (it was prepared with raw milk) of Carra cheese and that artisan practices may still be applied under potentially poor hygienic conditions in small dairies, there is a potential for L. monocytogenes in the cheese at the time of consumption. Therefore, this study was undertaken to describe what might be expected if Carra cheese is manufactured from contaminated raw milk. In Carra cheese, the pathogen might survive after ripening for 90 days. Therefore, we think that individuals should be consuming Carra cheese with caution. Otherwise, Listeria-contaminated Carra cheese may cause serious and mortal illnesses, even outbreaks, in humans. 3abacterial contamination 3atraditional technology 3araw milk 3acheese ripening 3aplate count 3afood pathogens 3apH 3aNigella sativa 3afood sanitation 3aprocessing stages 3aListeria monocytogenes 3aTurkey (country) 0acheesemaking0 tJournal of food safety.g2009 May, v. 29, no. 2 p.253-260dBlackwell Publishing Incx0149-60857nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1745-4565.2009.00154.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20090530b20090608c00000000  aINDdPNNe2009/05/30  aOther US 7aarticle01609naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001500110245008400125300001200209500001500221520073300236650002300969650002600992650001301018650001301031650002101044653002001065700002001085700001701105700001701122773006601139852000901205930003301214945001301247946001101260655001201271IND2151376020221119114006.0980811e199701  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND215137602DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAtta, M.B.14aThe effect of cooking on the content of heavy metals in fish (Tilapia nilotica)  ap. 1-4.  a2019-12-05  aFish (Tilapia nilotica) were grown in polluted water with some heavy metals namely cadmium (Cd), copper (Cu), lead (Pb) and zinc (Zn).

The results revealed that heavy metal contents in fish parts varied according to concentrations in the environment and the type of fish tissue. The highest levels (all examined metals) were found in visceral tissues followed by the head. The lowest value was found in fish flesh. The heavy metal content in all fish parts decreased on steaming and baking. The reduction in the metal content on baking was much greater than on steaming. 3afood contamination 3aOreochromis niloticus 3aroasting 3asteaming 3afood composition 0afood processing1 aEl-Sebaie, L.A.1 aNoaman, M.A.1 aKassab, H.E.0 tFood chemistry.g1997 , v. 58, no. 1/2 p.1-4x0308-81467nnas  aDNAL  a19981001b19981008c00000000  aINDdHBI  aNon-US 7aarticle02124naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002000110245009900130300001300229520128400242650001601526650002001542650002101562650002001583650001801603700001501621700002001636700002101656773006701677852000901744930003301753945001301786946001101799655001201810IND2151376620221119114210.0980811e199701  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND215137662DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJayarajah, C.N.10aDephytinisation of wheat bran and the consequences for fibre matrix non-starch polysaccharides  ap. 5-12.  aWheat bran is a rich source of dietary fibre. Modified milling technologies can yield fibre-enriched bran fractions but the processing also leads to a concentration of phytate, which has a perceived detrimental effect on mineral metabolism. Endogenous phytase activity in wheat grain can be used to reduce phytate levels, and methods to optimise phytase activity have been investigated using aleurone-enriched and pericarp-enriched bran fractions. It was found that dephytinisation of wheat bran could he achieved at a relatively low moisture content for each fraction. The extent of dephytinisation could be controlled either through control of moisture content or through time of incubation. By using yeast, the rate of dephytinisation at 35 degrees C was similar to that achieved by endogenous phytase alone at 55 degrees C. The endogenous phytase activity resulted in the destruction of phytate without accumulation of inositol phosphate intermediates, as monitored using 31P-NMR spectroscopy. Also, at low moisture levels there was no apparent modification of fibre components through polysaccharidase activities which may he present in the bran. Therefore bran fractions can be readily dephytinised at low moisture contents and without modification of the fibre components. 3aphytic acid 3aenzyme activity 3afood composition 3afood processing 3adietary fiber1 aTang, H.R.1 aRobertson, J.A.1 aSelvendran, R.R.0 tFood chemistry.g1997 , v. 58, no. 1/2 p.5-12x0308-81467nnas  aDNAL  a19981001b19981008c00000000  aINDdHBI  aNon-US 7aarticle03617naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001500110245010000125300001600225520235300241650001602594650001102610650001702621650002102638650001502659650001502674650001602689650001502705650002302720650001102743650001002754650001402764650001502778653001402793653001602807653001202823653001702835653001402852653002202866653002102888653003202909700001502941700001502956773008602971852000903057930003303066945001303099946001103112655001203123IND2330305720221119114042.0030107e200206  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233030572DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTosh, C.R.10aMaternal reproductive decisions are independent of feeding in the black bean aphid, Aphis fabae  ap. 619-629.  aAphids are phloem feeders and an important assumption has been that reproduction is initiated only after phloem ingestion. Here we investigate the plant tissue location of parturition cues in winged and wingless, summer virginoparae and autumn migrants (gynoparae) of the black bean aphid, Aphis fabae. These seasonal forms have different host preferences. Using electrical penetration graph (EPG: to observe activity of the mouthparts) and video-monitoring procedures we demonstrate that the time to first parturition after host-plant contact is significantly shorter than the time to first registered phloem contact in the summer winged form. In gynoparae, the time to first parturition does not significantly differ from time to first phloem contact but is shorter than time to first phloem ingestion. Times to first parturition, first registered phloem contact and first phloem ingestion do not differ significantly in the summer wingless form. Simultaneous EPG and video recording procedures show that a high proportion of individuals of all morphs (45-70%) initiate reproduction before sustained phloem activities (salivation/ingestion). The only behaviours that all individuals demonstrate before first parturition are 'non-penetration' (aphid on plant surface with mouthparts outside plant) and stylet 'pathway activity', including secretion of gelling saliva and penetration of the non-vascular (epidermis and mesophyll) cells. A short period of penetration of the peripheral plant tissues (five cell punctures per individual) by aphids tethered and monitored by EPG decreases the time to first parturition of the winged summer form when subsequently placed on a Parafilm sachet containing 15% sucrose solution. This treatment also significantly increases the incidence of reproduction and individual reproductive output of gynoparae over a 24-h period. No detectable effects of tissue penetration on subsequent reproductive output are observed in the wingless summer form. Additionally, EPGs reveal that a number of aphids of all morphs display xylem ingestion, which occurs predominantly before initiation of phloem feeding but is not necessary to initiate parturition. It is concluded that aphids are likely to detect parturition cues during stylet punctures of cells within peripheral tissue layers, before reaching the phloem vessels. 3aAphis fabae 3amorphs 3areproduction 3afeeding behavior 3amouthparts 3asalivation 3ahost plants 3aVicia faba 3aEuonymus europaeus 3aphloem 3axylem 3aingestion 3amonitoring 0arecording 0apenetration 0astimuli 0avirginoparae 0agynoparae 0astyle penetration 0aparturition cues 0aelectrial penetraiton graph1 aPowell, G.1 aHardie, J.0 tJournal of insect physiology.g2002 June, v. 48, no. 6 p.619-629x0022-19107nnas  aDNAL  a20030304b20030311c00000000  aINDdNZM  aNon-US 7aarticle03871naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072002000110072002000130072002000150100001700170245010100187300001800288500002800306500001500334520240700349650001502756650001602771650001602787650002302803650002202826650001402848650001902862650001902881650002402900650002402924650002502948650002802973650001103001650001903012650002803031650001703059650001603076653002103092653001603113653001503129700002003144700001903164700001603183773012003199852000903319946001303328655001203341IND4408260520221119114052.0080726s2008    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440826052DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Bieb.) and reed canarygrass (Phalaris arundinacea L.) has proven to be extremely persistent in the northern United States, but information about dairy cow performance on this mixture is lacking. Twenty lactating Holstein cows were used in a crossover design to compare dry matter (DM) intake and milk production from diets containing kura clover-reed canarygrass silage (KRS) or alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) silage (AS). Forages were cut, wilted, ensiled in horizontal plastic bags, and allowed to ferment for at least 50 d before beginning the feeding experiment. The KRS was approximately 40% kura clover and 60% reed canarygrass. Treatments were total mixed rations formulated with either 57% of total DM from 1) AS or 2) KRS. Experimental periods were 28 d, with the first 14 d for diet adaptation and the last 14 d for measurement of intake and milk production. The neutral detergent fiber (NDF) concentrations of AS and KRS were 37.3 and 47.3%, respectively. The fermentation analyses indicated that both silages underwent a restricted fermentation, producing primarily lactic acid and some acetic acid. Dry matter intake (24.2 vs. 22.8 kg) and 4% fat-corrected milk (32.8 vs. 30.9 kg) were significantly higher for cows fed AS than for cows fed KRS. Cows consumed less NDF (6.7 vs. 8.0 kg) and less digestible NDF (3.0 vs. 4.4 kg) when fed AS diets compared with KRS diets, but the pool of ruminally undegraded NDF was similar (3.7 kg) between diets. Cows produced 1.5 kg of milk/kg of DM consumed regardless of the diet, indicating that digestible NDF of KRS was utilized with similar efficiency as the cell wall constituents of AS, but the intake of cows fed KRS may have been limited by rumen fill. Milk fat concentration tended to be higher for cows fed AS, but the milk true protein concentration and yields of fat and protein did not differ by treatment. Milk urea nitrogen content was higher when cows consumed AS (16.4 mg/ dL) compared with KRS (13.4 mg/dL). The cows fed KRS consumed more NDF but less total DMI, based on the results from this trial with diets formulated to contain approximately 60% of DM as forage, resulting in slightly lower milk yields than cows fed excellent-quality AS. This grass-legume mixture has the potential to be a source of quality forage for dairy cows in regions where alfalfa persistence is a problem. 3adairy cows 3acow feeding 3aacetic acid 3amilk protein yield 3adry matter intake 3alactation 3aforage legumes 3aforage grasses 3asilage fermentation 3amilk fat percentage 3acell wall components 3aneutral detergent fiber 3asilage 3amilk fat yield 3amilk protein percentage 3afeed rations 3alactic acid 0amilk composition 0afeed intake 0amilk yield1 aHeemink, G.B.H.1 aAlbrecht, K.A.1 aCombs, D.K.0 tJournal of dairy science.g2008 Aug., v. 91, no. 8 p.3138-3144dAmerican Dairy Science Associationx0022-03027nnas  aDNAL  aOther US 7aarticle01696naa a2200313 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002400075040001800099100002200117245013800139300001600277520072400293650002301017650001901040650001701059650001701076650001701093650002301110650001101133653003001144700001901174700002401193773010301217852000901320939003301329945000801362655001201370991565350590742620221119114021.0780901e197803  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aCAIN7894833402DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPeringian, Lynda.10aConsumer beliefs concerning intentional and unintentional additives in health food breads: chlorinated hydrocarbon pesticide residues  ap. 160-162.  aExtract: The majority of 150 respondents to a consumer knowledge questionnaire believed breads purchased in health food stores to be free of pesticides as well as other additives. To determine the correctness of this belief, analyses were completed to compare the presence of PCBs (polychlorinated biphenyls) and 12 chlorinated hydrocarbon pesticides in five brands of bread purchased in health food stores ("health" breads) and five purchased at supermarkets ("traditional") breads). No statistical differences were noted between the breads. Data indicate that the high price of "health" breads is not justified solely by the fact that these products are pesticide free or contain residues below "traditional" samples. 3aconsumer attitudes 3afood additives 3afood beliefs 3ahealth foods 3ahydrocarbons 3apesticide residues 3abreads 0aAdditives and adulterants1 aShier, Nathan.1 aLeavitt, Richard A.0 pJ Food ProtectiontJournal of food protection.g1978 Mar., v. 41, no. 3 p.160-162x0362-028X7nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19780901c00000000  aFNC 7aarticle02272naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003000092024002200122024001900144040001800163100002100181245013300202300001800335500002400353506007600377520094000453506003701393650004801430650001901478650001301497650001101510650001001521650002601531650001501557700002101572700002001593773013601613852000901749856008001758856004801838655001201886IND4391814920221207101616.0070529e20070601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439181492DNAL7 a10.1128/AEM.00057-072doi7 aPMC19326772pmcid7 a174350012pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAltic, Leslie C.10aUV Light Inactivation of Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis in Milk as Assessed by FASTPlaqueTB Phage Assay and Culture  ap. 3728-3733.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aUV light inactivation of Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis in Middlebrook 7H9 broth and whole and semiskim milk was investigated using a laboratory-scale UV machine that incorporated static mixers within UV-penetrable pipes.

The FASTPlaqueTB phage assay provided more rapid enumeration of surviving M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis (within 24 h) than culture on Herrold's egg yolk medium (6 to 8 weeks). Despite the fact that plaque counts were consistently 1 to 2 log₁₀ lower than colony counts throughout the study, UV inactivation rates for M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis derived using the phage assay and culture results were not significantly different (P = 0.077).0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aMycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis 3abacteriophages 3aegg yolk 3amixers 3apipes 3aultraviolet radiation 3awhole milk1 aRowe, Michael T.1 aGrant, Irene R.0 tApplied and environmental microbiology.g2007 June 1, v. 73, no. 11 p.3728-3733dAmerican Society for Microbiologyx0099-22407nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1128/AEM.00057-073Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://aem.asm.org/contents-by-date.0.shtml 7aarticle03651naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134072000900152072000900161100001500170245012400185300001600309500002400325500001500349520204200364650002102406650001302427650001302440650002702453650001602480650002502496650002502521650002302546650001902569650002402588650002702612650002902639651001102668653001902679653001402698653002702712700001702739700001502756700001902771700002102790700002102811773010502832852000902937856009202946930003303038945002503071946001303096655001203109IND4419491220221119113859.0090424e200905  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441949122DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1745-4565.2009.00155.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ121 0aQ2011 aNero, L.A.10aAutochthonous microbiota of raw milk with antagonistic activity against Listeria moncytogenesand Salmonella enteritidis  ap. 261-270.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe objective of this study was to detect and identify the autochthonous microbiota of raw milk with antagonistic activity on Listeria monocytogenes and Salmonella Enteritidis. Three hundred sixty colonies isolated from 15 raw milk samples were tested for antagonistic activity for L. monocytogenes and S. Enteritidis using the "spot-on-the-lawn" method. The colonies detected as antagonistic were identified using API 20 Strep. Two types of inhibition were observed: total, characterized by the formation of a well-defined halo around the colony, and partial, with the formation of a diffused halo. Ninety-one (25.3%) colonies presented antagonistic activity for L. monocytogenes and 33 (9.2%) for S. Enteritidis. Most of the antagonistic cultures were lactic acid bacteria, mainly Lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis and Enterococcus faecium. The results indicate that microorganisms in the natural microbiota of raw milk may play an important role in the inhibition of key pathogens in dairy products. This article is an initial study from our group concerning the antagonistic activity of the autochthonous microbiota from raw milk. This activity can explain the low frequency of some pathogens in this food, and these findings were the basis for our current studies concerning the characterization of this activity. For the period of 2006-2008, our group received funds from the National Council for Scientific and Technological Development, Brazil, and the Foundation of Scientific Support from Minas Gerais state, Brazil, for this complete study, aiming to describe the antagonistic microorganisms (phenotypic and genotypic), their antimicrobial productions (identification, characterization and potential) and purification. This article has the importance of supporting similar studies concerning this phenomenon, and proves the necessity of future studies for isolation and characterization of autochthonous microorganisms in milk, with antimicrobial activity, for subsequent utilization in the dairy industry, improving food safety. 3astarter cultures 3ataxonomy 3araw milk 3aSalmonella Enteritidis 3aantagonists 3alactic acid bacteria 3aEnterococcus faecium 3aLactococcus lactis 3afood pathogens 3amicrobial detection 3aListeria monocytogenes 3aantibacterial properties 3aBrazil 0amicroorganisms 0aisolation 0aSalmonella enteritidis1 aMattos, M.R.1 aBeloti, V.1 aBarros, M.A.F.1 aOrtolani, M.B.T.1 aFranco, B.D.G.M.0 tJournal of food safety.g2009 May, v. 29, no. 2 p.261-270dBlackwell Publishing Incx0149-60857nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1745-4565.2009.00155.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20090530b20090608c00000000  aINDdPNNe2009/05/30  aOther US 7aarticle01141naa a2200241 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002400075040001800099100002600117245003800143300001600181520048500197650000900682650001200691653001500703700001600718773010300734852000900837939003300846945000800879655001200887991565349710742620221119113857.0781101e197806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aCAIN7894837912DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLabropoulos, Athan E.10aDelayed chilling of beef a review  ap. 483-485.  aExtract: Tenderness of beef can be influenced by various factors. Biochemical changes undergone by the components of muscle during the various stages of rigor mortis influence tenderness of the muscle. One of these changes, the "cold shortening" involved involved in contraction of muscle, has a particularly strong effect on tenderness. Factors such as relative rates of chill and delay chill, post mortem drop in pH and cold storage treatments have a tenderizing effect on beef. 3abeef 3acooling 0atenderness1 aKelly, R.F.0 pJ Food ProtectiontJournal of food protection.g1978 June, v. 41, no. 6 p.483-485x0362-028X7nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19781101c00000000  aFNC 7aarticle03359naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001500128245013800143300001800281520187600299650001002175650002102185650000802206650001702214650002002231650001802251650002502269650001402294650003802308650001202346650002402358650002802382650001402410650001102424650001602435650002902451650000902480650001302489650002302502650002002525650002302545650003002568650001002598700001502608700001602623700002102639700001602660773008602676852000902762939003302771946001302804655001202817IND9301383120221119113917.0930308e199212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND930138312DNAL7 a13354502pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aReid, R.L.10aNutritive quality and palatability of switchgrass hays for sheep: effects of cultivar, nitrogen fertilization, and time of adaptation  ap. 3877-3888.  aFeeding and palatability trials were conducted with four cultivars (cv) of switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.), fertilized at three levels of N (0, 75, or 150 kg of N/ha) in 2 yr. Wether sheep had ad libitum access to chopped hays, and intake, apparent digestibility, particle passage rates, and concentrations of blood metabolites were determined. Palatability was measured with mature sheep in cafeteria trials. Nitrogen fertilization did not affect (P > .05) DM digestibility (DMD) or DMI, but there was a year X N interaction (P < .01) for NDF digestibility. Dry matter digestibility values for combined years and N levels were 56.9, 54.4, 56.6, and 57.9% (P < .01) for Pathfinder, New Jersey 50, Kentucky 1625, and Trailblazer cv, respectively; mean DMI values were 60.4, 60.8, 57.7, and 64.0 g/kg BW(.75) (year X cv, P < .01). An apparently greater quality of Trailblazer was masked by weed invasion of N-fertilized stands of this cv in yr 2, with changes in hay composition. Lambs adapted to hay diets with time; mean DMI for cv and N levels combined increased (P < .001) from 50.5 to 71.4 g/kg BW.75 between wk 2 and 3 and wk 10 and 11, with no change in DMD. Intakes of NDF increased from 37.6 to 55.6 g/kg BW(.75), an increase of 48%. Marker (Yb) measurements indicated little change in particle passage rates with treatment. There were no major differences in blood composition, apart from increases in blood urea N, as a result of N fertilization. Cafeteria trials showed preference by sheep for Trailblazer and KY 1625 compared with NJ 50 and Pathfinder, with a N X cv interaction (P < .01). Trailblazer was preferred to KY 1625 in a two-choice situation (P < .01). Results show relatively small effects of cv and N fertilization on quality of switchgrass and indicate the need for a lengthy period of adaptation by sheep to the feeding of a warm-season grass. 3asheep 3aPanicum virgatum 3ahay 3apalatability 3anutritive value 3adigestibility 3anitrogen fertilizers 3acultivars 2aAnimal Feedxanalysisxstandards. 2aAnimals 2aBlood Urea Nitrogen 2aDietary Fiberxanalysis 2aDigestion 2aEating 2aFertilizers 2aGastrointestinal Transit 2aMale 2aNitrogen 2aNutritional Status 2aNutritive Value 2aPoaceaexchemistry 2aSheepxbloodxphysiology. 2aTaste1 aJung, G.A.1 aPuoli, J.R.1 aCox-Ganser, J.M.1 aScott, L.L.0 tJournal of animal science.g1992 Dec., v. 70, no. 12 p.3877-3888x0021-88127nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle01593naa a2200277 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002400075040001800099100001900117245008900136300001600225520078300241650001701024650001701041650001701058650001401075650001601089650002401105700002101129773010301150852000901253939003301262945000801295655001201303991565349140742620221119114157.0781101e197806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aCAIN7894840362DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRhee, Ki Soon.10aOxidative deterioration in vegetable oils: health food oils versus conventional oils  ap. 443-446.  aExtract: Storage stability of health food and conventional vegetable oils was evaluated by determining oxidative deterioration during accelerated storage at 60 C of unused oils and room temperature storage of unused and used (once heated) oils.

In the choice experiment, newly moulted final instar larvae were provided with one of three protein-biased foods (PB-food: p35:c7, p28:c5.6 or p21:c4.2) and one of three equal protein-carbohydrate ratio foods (ER-food: p21:c21, p16.8:c16.8 or p12.6:c12.6). On five of the nine treatments, caterpillars independently regulated protein and carbohydrate intake to a mixture of 57 and 43%, respectively. However, when the concentration of the ER-food decreased and that of the paired PB-food increased, caterpillars progressively abandoned regulation and ate more of the PB-food. Despite these regulatory differences, performance (survivorship, growth and development) was similar across all nine treatments. In the no-choice experiment, caterpillars were given one of five foods (p35:c7, p28:c14, p21:c21, p14:c28 and p7:c35). Results indicated that caterpillars moved to a point in protein-carbohydrate space that was consistent with the Equal Distance Rule of compromise, a pattern previously predicted for generalist feeders. The insects on the two extreme foods, p35:c7 and p7:c35, showed reduced pupal mass and longer development, respectively. There was also strong evidence for post-ingestive regulation of nutrient utilisation, notably for protein. 3afood intake 3amathematical models 3adietary protein 3aSpodoptera littoralis 3afood conversion 3adietary carbohydrate 3anutritive value 3aprotein intake 3anutrient balance 3afeeding behavior 3amortality 3alarvae 3abiological development 0anutrient intake 0aregulation 0adietary self selection 0agrowth 0anutrition physiology1 aBehmer, S.T.1 aSimpson, S.J.1 aRaubenheimer, D.0 tJournal of insect physiology.g2002 June, v. 48, no. 6 p.655-665x0022-19107nnas  aDNAL  a20030304b20030311c00000000  aINDdNZM  aNon-US 7aarticle01397naa a2200289 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002400075040001800099100002300117245005900140300001600199520057900215650002300794650000900817650002200826650000900848650001200857650001800869653003500887700001900922773010400941852000901045939003301054945000801087655001201095991565348500742620221119114122.0780901e197711  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aCAIN7894828132DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCohen, Mitchell L.10aTrends in foodborne salmonellosis outbreaks: 1963-1975  ap. 798-800.  aExtract: Since 1963, 651 outbreaks of human salmonellosis have been reported to the Center for Disease Control. The vehicle of transmission was identified in 463 (71 percent) of the reported outbreaks. The three most important vehicles have been poultry, meat, and eggs, which accounted for 99 (21 percent), 69 (15 percent), and 53 (11 percent) of the outbreaks respectively. Egg associated outbreaks decreased markedly during the study period while meat associated outbreaks (particularly beef) gradually increased and poultry associated outbreaks showed no constant trend. 3adisease prevention 3aeggs 3afoodborne illness 3ameat 3apoultry 3asalmonellosis 0aCenter for Disease Control CDC1 aBlake, Paul A.0 pJ Food ProtectiontJournal of food protection.g1977 Nov., v. 40, no. 11 p.798-800x0362-028X7nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19780901c00000000  aFNC 7aarticle02766naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002500152245011000177300001600287500002400303520141800327650002701745650001401772650001001786650001501796650001201811650001701823650001501840650001301855650001101868650002501879650001201904650002001916650002201936653003501958653002701993653002502020700002202045700001802067700002002085700003402105773010502139852000902244856005502253655001202308IND4409805720221119114100.0080905e200810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440980572DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2311.2008.01015.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aUNSICKER, SYBILLE B.10aColour morph related performance in the meadow grasshopper Chorthippus parallelus (Orthoptera, Acrididae)  ap. 631-637.  aIncludes references  a1. Polymorphism has been described for a number of herbivorous insects, but little is known about whether differences in body colour cause fitness differences. In Chorthippus parallelus, three main colour morphs occur, namely brown, green, and dorsally striped. 2. The present study examined colour morph abundances and morph-related differences in body size, oviposition rate, and offspring numbers in females of C. parallelus collected in 15 montane grasslands. The study also examined the effect of plant species richness, composition, community productivity, and solar radiation on colour morph frequency and fitness. 3. The relative frequencies of the three colour morphs was 31.7% (brown), 33.1% (green), and 35.2% (dorsally striped), but the morphs were not evenly distributed across the 15 sites. 4. There was no effect of the habitat variables on the distribution of the green and the striped morph in the study sites, however 80% of the variation in the abundances of the brown morph was explained by plant species richness and composition. 5. Grasshopper size was equal among the morphs. Brown females laid significantly more egg pods than the green and dorsally striped morphs. There were no significant differences in offspring numbers among the colour morphs. 6. Body colour in C. parallelus seems to be a fitness-relevant trait, raising the question of the evolutionary maintenance of polymorphism. 3aChorthippus parallelus 3abody size 3acolor 3aegg masses 3afemales 3agrasshoppers 3agrasslands 3ahabitats 3amorphs 3aphytophagous insects 3aprogeny 3asolar radiation 3aspecies diversity 0aextensively managed grasslands 0aplant species richness 0areproductive success1 aKöhler, Günter.1 aLINZ, JEANINE1 aStein, Claudia.1 aWeisser, W.

Reliable interpretations require considerable experience with an assay and an extensive database from field and research case samples of a variety of species. The Michigan State University Animal Health Diagnostic Laboratory (MSU-AHDL) has offered Se analyses by acid-digestion and fluorometric detection since 1982. This laboratory expects serum Se values (nanograms per milliliter) of livestock to increase gradually with age from starting ranges for neonates of 50 to 80 for calves and sheep and 70 to 90 for foals and pigs. Expected or "normal" values for the adults are in the ranges of 70 to 100 for cattle, 120 to 150 for sheep, 130 to 160 for horses, and 180 to 220 for swine. Normal liver Se concentrations are considered to range between 1.2 and 2.0 micrograms/g on a dry weight basis, regardless of the species or age. Based on samples submitted to MSU-AHDL between September 1990 and August 1991, contemporary feeding practices in the Michigan area resulted in mean serum Se values (nanograms per milliliter) of 75 +/- 19 for adult Holsteins, 170 +/- 27 for adult swine (mixed breeds), and 137 +/- 30 for adult race horses. Within that period of time, two field cases of Se toxicity were diagnosed. One involved feeder pigs with a recorded high serum Se value of 1,525 ng/ml due to a commercial premix manufacturing error. The other involved mature horses with a recorded high serum Se of 928 ng/ml due to consumption of hays with a natural Se content of 20 ppm. 3adairy cows 3afeed mixing 3ainterspecific variation 3ablood serum 3alaboratory techniques 3anormal values 3ahematologic tests 3aselenosis 3aselenium 3ahay 3aracehorses 3afeed supplements 3aaccuracy 3aswine 2aAgingxmetabolism 2aAnimals 2aAnimals, Domesticxbloodxmetabolism. 2aCattlexblood 2aHorse Diseasesxchemically induced 2aHorsesxblood 2aLiverxchemistry 2aReference Values 2aSeleniumxanalysisxbloodxpoisoning. 2aSheepxblood 2aSwinexblood 2aSwine Diseasesxchemically induced 0aspecies differences 0aerrors1 aHerdt, T.H.0 tJournal of animal science.g1992 Dec., v. 70, no. 12 p.3928-3933x0021-88127nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02148naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001400128245007400142300001800216500011100234500002300345500001500368520082300383650002001206650001001226650001501236650004301251650003801294650001401332650002601346650001201372650003301384650001101417650002501428653002601453653002101479653002301500653001501523653002301538773008601561852000901647939003301656946001301689655001201702IND9301384020221119113856.0930308e199212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND930138402DNAL7 a14740322pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChu, F.S.10aRecent progress on analytical techniques for mycotoxins in feedstuffs  ap. 3950-3963.  aPaper presented at a symposium entitled "Current Perspectives on Mycotoxins in Animal Feeds," Laramie, WY.  aLiterature review.  a2019-12-04  aAnalysis of mycotoxins in feedstuffs is a difficult task because only trace amounts of the toxins are present in the sample. However, rapid progress in the area of mycotoxin analysis has been made during the last few years. Simplified sample cleanup protocols and new chromatographic methods, especially HPLC, have been developed. New, more sensitive and versatile instruments such as high-resolution mass spectrometry (MS) and gas chromatography/tandem MS/MS are coming to the market. After 15 yr of laboratory research, immunoassay techniques have gained more acceptance as analytical tools for mycotoxins. Several immunoassay kits for mycotoxins are currently available. The development of these new techniques and their application for monitoring various mycotoxins in foods and feeds are described in this review. 3aimmunochemistry 3afeeds 3aaflatoxins 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3ascreening 2aAnimal Feedxanalysis 2aAnimals 2aFood Contaminationxanalysis 2aHumans 2aMycotoxinsxanalysis 0alaboratory techniques 0aquality controls 0aliterature reviews 0amycotoxins 0aanalytical methods0 tJournal of animal science.g1992 Dec., v. 70, no. 12 p.3950-3963x0021-88127nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02682naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134072000900152072000900161100001400170245017800184300001800362500002400380500001500404520108800419650002001507650002701527650002301554650002301577650001101600650001501611650002301626650002401649650004401673650002101717650001901738650002701757651001201784653001001796653001201806700001901818700001601837700001401853700001601867773010901883852000901992856009202001930003302093945002502126946001302151655001202164IND4408374420221119113811.0080801e200808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440837442DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1750-3841.2008.00846.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ121 0aQ5011 aZiadi, M.10aAnalysis of Volatile Compounds Produced by 2 Strains of Lactococcus lactis Isolated from Leben (Tunisian Fermented Milk) Using Solid-Phase Microextraction-Gas Chromatography  ap.

Volatile compounds from Leben were concentrated by a Carboxen-PDMS fiber and analyzed by GC-MS. These compounds include acids, alcohols, aldehydes, ketones, sulfur compounds, and hydrocarbons. Commercial Leben presented a poor volatile profile compared to the laboratory-made Leben. The mixed culture of 2 Lactococcus lactis strains resulted in higher volatile compound formation than the single strain culture. The GC volatile profiles of Leben produced in flask and in the 100-L fermentor were similar. Changes in volatile compounds were observed during storage at 4 °C. The effect of culture conditions on production of volatiles by SLT6 strain was studied. Aeration (0.1 mL/min) and agitation enhanced the production of diacetyl, acetoin, 3-methylbutanal, and 3-methylbutanol. Fermentation at pH 5 had no effect on volatile production. 3amicroextraction 3acultured milk starters 3avolatile compounds 3agas chromatography 3amixing 3afermenters 3astrain differences 3astorage temperature 3aLactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis 3afood composition 3afermented milk 3asolid phase extraction 3aTunisia 0aLeben 0astrains1 aWathelet, J.P.1 aMarlier, M.1 aHamdi, M.1 aThonart, P.0 tJournal of food science.g2008 Aug., v. 73, no. 6 p.S247-S252dBlackwell Publishing Incx0022-11477nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1750-3841.2008.00846.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20090325b20090508c00000000  aINDd2CTe2009/03/04  aOther US 7aarticle02635naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134072000900152072000900161100002000170245009400190300001800284500002400302520131700326650001601643650001901659650001601678650002201694650002101716650002601737650002101763650001401784650001901798653003401817700001601851700001501867700001401882700001201896773010901908852000902017856009202026930003302118945002502151946001302176655001202189IND4408374620221119113540.0080801e200808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440837462DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1750-3841.2008.00847.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ505 0aQ2051 aPickering, G.J.10aDetection Thresholds for 2-Isopropyl-3-Methoxypyrazine in Concord and Niagara Grape Juice  ap. S262-S266.  aIncludes references  a2-Isopropyl-3-methoxypyrazine (IPMP) is the compound responsible for the off-flavor known as ladybug taint, which occurs when Harmonia axyridis beetles become incorporated with the grapes during juice processing. It is also an important grape-derived component of juice flavor in some varieties. The main objective of this study was to determine the orthonasal (ON) and retronasal (RN) detection thresholds for IPMP in juice. The ASTM E679 ascending forced choice method of limits was used to determine detection thresholds for 26 individuals in Concord and Niagara juices. Group best estimate thresholds (BETs) averaged 0.93 ng/L and were 50% and 21% higher in Concord than in Niagara juices for ON and RN evaluation, respectively. Group BETs for IPMP (ng/L) for Concord were ON: 1.11; RN: 1.02 and for Niagara were ON: 0.74; RN: 0.84. Variation in individual detection thresholds was observed, although familiarity with ladybug taint was not associated with individual threshold values. We conclude that humans are very sensitive to IPMP in juice, and that detection thresholds are more strongly influenced by grape variety than evaluation mode. These results may assist juice producers in establishing tolerance levels for IPMP in juice affected by ladybug taint or derived from grapes of suboptimal ripeness. 3agrape juice 3aVitis vinifera 3aoff flavors 3ataste sensitivity 3afood composition 3aquantitative analysis 3aflavor compounds 3acultivars 3aodor compounds 0a2-isopropyl-3-methoxypyrazine1 aKarthik, A.1 aInglis, D.1 aSears, M.1 aKer, K.0 tJournal of food science.g2008 Aug., v. 73, no. 6 p.S262-S266dBlackwell Publishing Incx0022-11477nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1750-3841.2008.00847.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20090325b20090508c00000000  aINDd2CTe2009/03/04  aOther US 7aarticle03127naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134072000900152072000900161100001800170245010300188300001800291500002400309500001500333520147000348650002301818650002801841650002101869650002201890650002001912650002301932650002201955650001701977650001601994650001902010650002102029650001802050650001702068650001702085650002802102650001202130650001702142650001702159650001802176653002202194700001902216700001802235700002702253773010902280852000902389856009202398930003302490945002502523946001302548655001202561IND4408373120221119113806.0080801e200808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440837312DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1750-3841.2008.00791.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ205 0aQ1051 aLavinas, F.C.10aEffect of High Hydrostatic Pressure on Cashew Apple (Anacardium occidentale L.)

Cashew apple juice has a pleasant flavor and is rich in vitamin C. Studies to determine the effect of high pressure on microorganisms in cashew apple juice are still lacking. In this study, the inactivation of natural micropopulation and inoculated Escherichia coli by high pressure was evaluated in fresh cashew apple juice. The microbiological stability of pressure-treated juice was also evaluated. The applied high pressure levels ranged from 250 to 400 MPa for periods of 3 to 7 min. Treatments with 350 MPa for 7 min and 400 MPa for either 3 or 7 min reduced the aerobic mesophilic bacteria count to a level below the detection limit. Pressure treatments were also efficient in inactivating yeast and filamentous fungi. The inoculated E. coli (10⁶ CFU/mL) was reduced to below 10 CFU/mL after a pressure treatment of 400 MPa for 3 min. The inactivation of this microorganism followed a 1st-order reaction kinetics. The decimal reduction time (D-value) ranged from 1.21 to 16.43 min, while pressure resistance value (z-value) was 123.46 MPa. Neither natural micropopulation growth nor E. coli repair was observed in postprocessed (400 MPa for 3 min) cashew apple juice kept under refrigerated storage (at 4 °C) during 8 wk. The results of this study demonstrated the efficacy of high-pressure treatment for preserving cashew apple juice. 3atemporal variation 3abacterial contamination 3aEscherichia coli 3areaction kinetics 3adetection limit 3afood contamination 3afood preservation 3acashew fruit 3aplate count 3afood pathogens 3amicrobial growth 3arefrigeration 3adisinfection 3astorage time 3ahigh pressure treatment 3aaerobes 3afruit juices 3acold storage 3aascorbic acid 0afood microbiology1 aMiguel, M.A.L.1 aLopes, M.L.M.1 aValente Mesquita, V.L.0 tJournal of food science.g2008 Aug., v. 73, no. 6 p.M273-M277dBlackwell Publishing Incx0022-11477nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1750-3841.2008.00791.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20090325b20090508c00000000  aINDd2CTe2009/03/04  aOther US 7aarticle02426naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002400145245004400169300001600213500002400229520125700253650001301510650001601523650002501539650001801564650001101582650001601593650001801609650001701627650001701644650002001661650002901681650001001710651000901720653002701729653002101756653002001777653002001797700002301817773009501840852000901935856004801944655001201992IND4417088920221119113429.0090228e200903  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441708892DNAL7 a10.1007/s10040-008-0331-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStevanović, Zoran.10aGroundwater management in northern Iraq  ap. 367-378.  aIncludes references  aGroundwater is vital and the sole resource in most of the studied region of northern Iraq.

Although Iraq is currently dramatically disturbed by complex political and socio-economic problems, in its northern part, i.e. the Kurdish-inhabited region, fast urbanization and economic expansion are visible everywhere. Monitoring and water management schemes are necessary to prevent aquifer over-exploitation in the region. Artificial recharge with temporary runoff water, construction of subsurface dams and several other aquifer management and regulation measures have been designed, and some implemented, in order to improve the water situation. Recommendations, presented to the local professionals and decision-makers in water management, include creation of Water Master Plans and Water User Associations, synchronization of drilling programmes, rehabilitation of the existing well fields, opening of new well fields, and the incorporation of new spring intakes in some areas with large groundwater reserves, as well as construction of numerous small-scale schemes for initial in situ water treatment where saline groundwater is present. 3aaquifers 3agroundwater 3agroundwater recharge 3aprofessionals 3arunoff 3arural areas 3arural poverty 3aurbanization 3awater supply 3awater treatment 3awater users associations 3awells 3aIraq 0aGroundwater management 0aOver-abstraction 0aInjection wells 0aSubsurface dams1 aIurkiewicz, Adrian0 tHydrogeology journal.g2009 Mar., v. 17, no. 2 p.367-378dSpringer-Verlagx1431-21747nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10040-008-0331-0 7aarticle03622naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134072000900152072000900161072000900170072000900179100002000188245011500208300001600323500002400339520232500363650002502688650001902713650001502732650001402747650001402761650001802775650002202793650001802815700001902833700002102852700001902873773012402892852000903016856009203025930003303117945002503150946001303175655001203188IND4408238020221119113401.0080726e200808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440823802DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1749-7345.2008.00189.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aM120 0aL200 0aL600 0aM0011 aMoss, Dustin R.10aInbreeding Effects on Hatchery and Growout Performance of Pacific White Shrimp, Penaeus (Litopenaeus) vannamei  ap. 467-476.  aIncludes references  aIn animal breeding programs, selection coupled with a narrow genetic base can cause high levels of inbreeding to occur rapidly (in one or two generations). Although the effects of inbreeding have been studied extensively in terrestrial animals and to a lesser extent in aquaculture species, little is known about the effects of inbreeding on penaeid shrimp. The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of inbreeding on hatchery and growout performance of the Pacific white shrimp, Penaeus vannamei. The experiment was conducted over 2 yr, and data from two successive generations (G₂ and G₃) of inbred (sibling-sibling mating) and outbred families were analyzed. There were 11 inbred and 12 outbred families in G₂ and 9 inbred and 10 outbred families in G₃. Inbreeding coefficients (F) for outbred and inbred families were 0.00 and 0.25, respectively, for G₂ and 0.00 and 0.375, respectively, for G₃. Growth rates for outbreds and inbreds were similar in both G₂ and G₃. Hatch rate for inbred families was 33.1% lower than for outbred families in G₂ and 47.1% lower in G₃. Inbreeding depression (IBD) (relative change in phenotype per 0.1 increase in F) ± 95% CI for hatch rate was -12.3 ± 10.1%. Hatchery survival for inbred families was 31.4% lower than for outbred families in G₂ and 38.8% lower in G₃. IBD for hatchery survival was -11.0 ± 5.7%. Growout survival was 1.9% lower for inbred families than for outbred families in G₂ and 19.6% lower in G₃. IBD for growout survival was -3.8 ± 2.9%. There was also a significant linear relationship between IBD estimates for survival traits and mean outbred survival. At high outbred survival, IBD was low (e.g., growout survival in G₂), but IBD appeared to become more severe when outbred survival was lower. This suggests that stress (related to environment and/or life stage) may worsen IBD for survival traits. Results also indicate that moderate to high levels of inbreeding (>10%) should be avoided in commercial shrimp hatcheries because the cumulative effect of IBD on hatch rate and hatchery survival will significantly reduce postlarvae production. Thus, IBD can be significant enough to justify the use of inbreeding as a germplasm protection strategy (under certain scenarios) for genetic improvement programs. 3aLitopenaeus vannamei 3ashrimp culture 3ainbreeding 3aviability 3amortality 3aanimal stress 3aanimal production 3aanimal growth1 aArce, Steve M.1 aOtoshi, Clete A.1 aMoss, Shaun M.0 tJournal of the World Aquaculture Society.g2008 Aug., v. 39, no. 4 p.467-476dBlackwell Publishing Incx0893-88497nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1749-7345.2008.00189.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20090803b00000000c00000000  aINDdGAYe2009/08/03  aOther US 7aarticle03146naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134072000900152072000900161072000900170072000900179072000900188100002500197245026400222300001600486500002400502500001500526520149200541650001702033650001602050650001202066650002102078650002002099650002302119650001802142650002102160650002002181650001502201650001702216650002402233650000902257650002502266653001402291700002702305773012402332852000902456856009202465930003302557945002502590946001302615655001202628IND4408237920221119113432.0080726e200808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440823792DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1749-7345.2008.00179.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aM120 0aL500 0aL600 0aL832 0aM0011 aTrushenski, Jesse T.10aInfluence of Vitamin E Source and Dietary Supplementation Level on Production Performance of Sunshine Bass, Morone chrysops [female symbol] x Morone saxatilis [male symbol], Fillet Tocopherol Content, and Immunocompetency during Stress and Bacterial Challenge  ap. 454-466.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aWe evaluated the effects of dietary vitamin E concentration and source on production performance and immunocompetency of sunshine bass, Morone chrysops x Morone saxatilis, following stress and disease challenge. Four diets were formulated to contain requisite levels (1x) or five times (5x) the vitamin E requirement of sunshine bass as met by synthetic vitamin E (SYNE) or natural source vitamin E (NSVE). Each diet was fed to juvenile sunshine bass for 8 wk prior to experimental challenges. Replicate tanks within each dietary treatment were challenged with stressor exposure (chasing with dip net), incidental Flavobacterium columnare exposure, or both; control groups were not challenged. Pathogen and/or stressor exposure largely resulted in significant reductions in immunological performance. Although significant independent dietary effects were not observed among immunological parameters, suppression of complement and macrophage respiratory burst activities was numerically lower within the 5x NSVE treatment. Production performance was largely unaffected by dietary vitamin E source or level. Fillet α-tocopherol concentration was significantly higher among fish fed the 5x diets (40.7/41.6 vs. 12.2/14.5 μg/g dry tissue for 1x diets); however, the dietary concentration required to achieve these levels was lower for NSVE. Although super-requirement levels of either source of vitamin E were apparently beneficial, NSVE was effective at ~50% lower supplementation levels. 3afish culture 3atocopherols 3ahybrids 3aimmunocompetence 3afish production 3aexperimental diets 3aanimal stress 3aMorone saxatilis 3aMorone chrysops 3ahematology 3afish fillets 3adietary supplements 3abass 3abacterial infections 0avitamin E1 aKohler, Christopher C.0 tJournal of the World Aquaculture Society.g2008 Aug., v. 39, no. 4 p.454-466dBlackwell Publishing Incx0893-88497nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1749-7345.2008.00179.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20090803b00000000c00000000  aINDdGAYe2009/08/03  aOther US 7aarticle02830naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002400145245013300169300001800302500002400320520164300344650001901987650001502006650002302021650002502044650001002069650002002079650001202099650002302111650001202134650001402146650001302160650001102173650001202184651000902196700002602205700002202231773011002253852000902363856004802372655001202420IND4435274620221119113414.0100409e201005  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443527462DNAL7 a10.1007/s10531-009-9773-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHolland, Brenden S.12aA reptilian smoking gun: first record of invasive Jackson's chameleon (Chamaeleo jacksonii) predation on native Hawaiian species  ap. 1437-1441.  aIncludes references  aHere we report the first conclusive evidence of an introduced reptile (Chamaeleo jacksonii) feeding on Hawaiian taxa, including 11 snails in four endemic genera from two families, including four individuals of an endangered species (Achatinella mustelina), and native insects in five genera. Native Hawaiian invertebrates were discovered in the dissected stomachs of wild caught Jackson's chameleons collected from June to November 2009 on the island of Oahu. Although Jackson's chameleons were introduced to the Hawaiian Islands in the early 1970s, ecological impacts have never been documented. Of particular concern is the fact that chameleons have previously only rarely been found in native Hawaiian habitat, although 12 were recently collected in a mid-elevation native forest, an area that is not likely to be suitable for their long-term persistence, but that is adjacent to higher elevation pristine forest where endemic prey are abundant and favorable climatic conditions exist for chameleon persistence. One concern is that Jacksons's chameleons may be undergoing a range expansion into upper elevation pristine forests. If chameleons reach and establish populations in these areas, devastating impacts to the native ecosystem are possible. A thorough understanding of the impacts of chameleons on Hawaiian fauna will require additional evaluation and sampling, but dissemination of this discovery in a timely fashion is important as it provides new information regarding this threat. Monitoring and collection of chameleons is ongoing, particularly in native Hawaiian forest habitats at mid and upper elevations (600-1,300 m). 3aChamaeleonidae 3aecosystems 3aendangered species 3aenvironmental impact 3afauna 3aforest habitats 3aforests 3aindigenous species 3aislands 3apredation 3areptiles 3asnails 3astomach 3aOahu1 aMontgomery, Steven L.1 aCostello, Vincent0 tBiodiversity and conservation.g2010 May, v. 19, no. 5 p.1437-1441dSpringer Netherlandsx0960-31157nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10531-009-9773-5 7aarticle03048naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003000092024002200122024001900144040001800163100004000181245012100221300001600342500002400358506007600382520159500458506003702053650002702090650001802117650001202135650001802147650001402165650001102179650002102190650001202211650001402223650001102237700002102248700001702269700002002286700002302306700002002329700001902349773013302368852000902501856008002510655001202590IND4432057420221207083309.0100129e20100201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443205742DNAL7 a10.1128/AEM.02175-092doi7 aPMC28130262pmcid7 a199488512pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHowlader, Mohammad Tofazzal Hossain10aAlanine Scanning Analyses of the Three Major Loops in Domain II of Bacillus thuringiensis Mosquitocidal Toxin Cry4Aa  ap. 860-865.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCry4Aa produced by Bacillus thuringiensis is a dipteran-specific toxin and is of great interest for developing a bioinsecticide to control mosquitoes. Therefore, it is very important to characterize the functional motif of Cry4Aa that is responsible for its mosquitocidal activity. In this study, to characterize a potential receptor binding site, namely, loops 1, 2, and 3 in domain II, we constructed a series of Cry4Aa mutants in which a residue in these three loops was replaced with alanine. A bioassay using Culex pipiens larvae revealed that replacement of some residues affected the mosquitocidal activity of Cry4Aa, but the effect was limited. This finding was partially inconsistent with previous results which suggested that replacement of the Cry4Aa loop 2 results in a significant loss of mosquitocidal activity. Therefore, we constructed additional mutants in which multiple (five or six) residues in loop 2 were replaced with alanine. Although the replacement of multiple residues also resulted in some decrease in mosquitocidal activity, the mutants still showed relatively high activity. Since the insecticidal spectrum of Cry4Aa is specific, Cry4Aa must have a specific receptor on the surface of the target tissue, and loss of binding to the receptor should result in a complete loss of mosquitocidal activity. Our results suggested that, unlike the receptor binding site of the well-characterized molecule Cry1, the receptor binding site of Cry4Aa is different from loops 1, 2, and 3 or that there are multiple binding sites that work cooperatively for receptor binding.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aBacillus thuringiensis 3aCulex pipiens 3aalanine 3abinding sites 3abioassays 3alarvae 3amosquito control 3amutants 3areceptors 3atoxins1 aKagawa, Yasuhiro1 aMiyakawa, Ai1 aYamamoto, Ayaka1 aTaniguchi, Tetsuya1 aHayakawa, Tohru1 aSakai, Hiroshi0 tApplied and environmental microbiology.g2010 Feb. 1, v. 76, no. 3 p.860-865dAmerican Society for Microbiologyx0099-22407nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1128/AEM.02175-093Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02863naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110245011800128300001600246500011000262500001500372520181600387650002102203650001802224650002002242650001502262650001802277650001502295651001102310653001002321653001602331700001602347773007202363852000902435930003302444945001302477946001102490655001202501IND2200083920221119113757.0990810e199808  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220008392DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBen-Amotz, A.10aAnalysis of carotenoids with emphasis on 9-cis beta-carotene in vegetables and fruits commonly consumed in Israel  ap. 515-520.  aPaper presented at the Royal Society of Chemistry meeting on Maillard Reaction, December 6, 1996, London.  a2019-12-05  aRecent epidemiological studies have directed the attention from the synthetic all-trans beta-carotene to natural carotenoids predominant in fruits and vegetables as possible active ingredients for prevention of cancer and cardiovascular diseases. Seventeen fruits and 17 vegetables commonly consumed in Israel and the beta-carotene-rich alga, Dunaliella bardawil, were analysed for their content of carotenoids with emphasis on 9-cis beta-carotene by reversed-phase, 3D photodiode array HPLC. Fourteen carotenoids were eluted in order of decreasing polarity, from polar oxycarotenoids to lipophilic hydrocarbons, and quantified in microgram carotenoid per gram freeze-dried plant sample. The richest sources of total carotenoids (> 100 micrograms/g dry weight) in Israeli fruits were pittango, mango and papaya while, in vegetables, the predominant types were carrot, dill, parsley, tomato, lettuce, sweet potato and red pepper. Red fruits and vegetables contained mainly lycopene. Yellow and orange fruits and vegetables had high contents of hydrocarbon carotenes with substantial levels of cryptoxanthins and xanthophylls. The green vegetables had high contents of both xanthophylls and hydrocarbon carotenes. Relatively high ratios (9-cis to all-trans beta-carotene) of above 0.2 g/g were noted in sweet potato, papaya, parsley, lettuce, dill, apricot, pepper, prune and pumpkin, compared to the high ratio of 9-cis to all-trans beta-carotene in the alga Dunaliella (approximately 1.0 g/g). The high content of 9-cis beta-carotene in certain fruits and vegetables and the wide variety of carotenoids and stereoisomers of carotenoids in all plants should shift nutritional and medical attention from the synthetic all-trans beta-carotene toward natural carotenoids as potential candidates for chemoprevention. 3anutrient content 3afood analysis 3avitamin content 3aDunaliella 3abeta-carotene 3avegetables 3aIsrael 0afruit 0acarotenoids1 aFishler, R.0 tFood chemistry.g1998 Aug., v. 62, no. 4 p.515-520x0308-81467nnas  aDNAL  a19991003b19991007c00000000  aINDdHBI  aNon-US 7aarticle02291naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002400152245011100176300001600287500002400303520126100327650001301588650001501601653002501616700002101641700002601662700001901688773012501707852000901832856009201841930003301933946001101966655001201977IND4408224520221119113711.0080726e200808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440822452DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1095-8312.2008.01023.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFIORENTINO, VIVIANA10aPhylogeography and morphological variability in land snails: the Sicilian Marmorana (Pulmonata, Helicidae)  ap. 809-823.  aIncludes references  aLand snails have long been recognized as suitable organisms for studying phenotypic differentiation and phylogeny in relation to geographical distribution. Morphological data (shell and anatomy biometry on different geographical scales) and partial sequences from mitochondrial genes (cytochrome oxidase subunit I, 16S rDNA) were used to test whether morphological patterns match phylogeny in a diversified group of Sicilian rock-dwelling land snails belonging to the genus Marmorana. The taxonomic implications of the three character sets (shell and anatomical biometry and molecular data) were also considered. The inferred phylogenetic relationships do not match morphological (shell and genitalia) patterns. This result may significantly modify the current taxonomy. Mitochondrial based reconstructions define several supported clades well correlated with geographic distribution and populations were found to be distributed parapatrically. The progressive decline in mitochondrial DNA sequence similarity over a distance of 250 km is consistent with a model of isolation by distance, a pattern previously recognized for other groups of land snails. For one clade of Marmorana, colonization along Mediterranean trade routes appears to be a possibility. 3abiometry 3aGastropoda 0aphenotypic diversity1 aSALOMONE, NICOLA1 aManganelli, Giuseppe.1 aGiusti, Folco.0 tBiological journal of the Linnean Society.g2008 Aug., v. 94, no. 4 p.809-823dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0024-40667nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1095-8312.2008.01023.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20080726b20080801c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03721naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003000092024002200122024001900144040001800163100002300181245016200204300001600366500002400382506007600406520206200482506003702544650004802581650002102629650001002650650002002660650001402680650002602694650002102720650003002741650001302771650001402784650001602798700001902814700002402833700002202857700002102879700001902900700002102919700001902940700001702959700001702976773013302993852000903126856008003135655001203215IND4415431920221207104254.0090123e20090201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441543192DNAL7 a10.1128/AEM.01683-082doi7 aPMC26321552pmcid7 a190473952pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCastellanos, Elena10aDiscovery of Stable and Variable Differences in the Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis Type I, II, and III Genomes by Pan-Genome Microarray Analysis  ap. 676-686.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aMycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis is an important animal pathogen widely disseminated in the environment that has also been associated with Crohn's disease in humans. Three M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis genomotypes are recognized, but genomic differences have not been fully described. To further investigate these potential differences, a 60-mer oligonucleotide microarray (designated the MAPAC array), based on the combined genomes of M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis (strain K-10) and Mycobacterium avium subsp. hominissuis (strain 104), was designed and validated. By use of a test panel of defined M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis strains, the MAPAC array was able to identify a set of large sequence polymorphisms (LSPs) diagnostic for each of the three major M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis types. M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis type II strains contained a smaller genomic complement than M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis type I and M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis type III genomotypes, which included a set of genomic regions also found in M. avium subsp. hominissuis 104. Specific PCRs for genes within LSPs that differentiated M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis types were devised and shown to accurately screen a panel (n = 78) of M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis strains. Analysis of insertion/deletion region INDEL12 showed deletion events causing a reduction in the complement of mycobacterial cell entry genes in M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis type II strains and significantly altering the coding of a major immunologic protein (MPT64) associated with persistence and granuloma formation. Analysis of MAPAC data also identified signal variations in several genomic regions, termed variable genomic islands (vGIs), suggestive of transient duplication/deletion events. vGIs contained significantly low GC% and were immediately flanked by insertion sequences, integrases, or short inverted repeat sequences. Quantitative PCR demonstrated that variation in vGI signals could be associated with colony growth rate and morphology.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aMycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis 3aanimal pathogens 3agenes 3agenomic islands 3agranuloma 3amicroarray technology 3aparatuberculosis 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aproteins 3ascreening 3atransposons1 aAranaz, Alicia1 aGould, Katherine A.1 aLinedale, Richard1 aStevenson, Karen1 aAlvarez, Julio1 aDominguez, Lucas1 ade Juan, Lucia1 aHinds, Jason1 aBull, Tim J.0 tApplied and environmental microbiology.g2009 Feb. 1, v. 75, no. 3 p.676-686dAmerican Society for Microbiologyx0099-22407nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1128/AEM.01683-083Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02066naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002000110245006500130300001400195520108600209650001801295650002301313650002001336650002801356650002301384650001201407650000701419650001601426650001901442650001601461650001901477650001501496653001401511700001801525773007101543852000901614930003301623945001301656946001101669655001201680IND2200086120221119113751.0990810e199809  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220008612DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAngsupanich, K.10aHigh pressure treatment effects on cod (Gadus morhua) muscle  ap. 39-50.  aAfter treatment at pressures above 400 MPa, the oxidative stability of the lipids in cod (Gadus morhua) muscle were markedly decreased as measured by the thiobarbituric acid (TBA) number. This was thought to be due to the release of metal catalysts from complexes, since addition of EDTA effectively inhibited the increased rates of oxidation. As judged by differential scanning calorimetry and electrophoresis this effect did not appear to be related to denaturation of the major proteins in meat, since myosin was denatured at 100-200 MPa and actin and most of the sarcoplasmic proteins at 300 MPa. A few water soluble proteins survived pressures of 800 MPa including several of the proteases, but there was a marked decrease in activity of the neutral proteases (pH optima 6.6) above 200 MPa. In contrast to heat-treatment, pressure was shown to lead to the formation of structures that were stabilised, at least to some extent, by hydrogen bonds and texture profile analysis (TPA) showed that the structures produced by heat and pressure treatments had very different textures. 3awater content 3apressure treatment 3afish processing 3afood processing quality 3alipid peroxidation 3atexture 3apH 3atemperature 3athermodynamics 3aproteolysis 3amuscle tissues 3acod (fish) 0astability1 aLedward, D.A.0 tFood chemistry.g1998 Sept., v. 63, no. 1 p.39-50x0308-81467nnas  aDNAL  a19990901b19990909c00000000  aINDdHBI  aNon-US 7aarticle03205naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072002000110100001800130245011100148300001800259500002800277520171900305650001202024650001902036650002102055650001102076650002302087650002402110650001802134650001302152650002402165650001202189650003302201650001902234650002502253650003902278650002002317650001402337653002402351653004002375653004002415700002102455700002402476700001802500700001902518700002002537773012002557852000902677946001302686655001202699IND4408259520221119113848.0080726s2008    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440825952DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

High energy intake and excessive fatness also increase serum leptin. Our objective was to determine if an infusion of leptin decreases proliferation of mammary epithelial cells of prepubertal heifers in vivo. Ovine leptin at 100 μg/ quarter per d with or without 10 μg of insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-I was infused via the teat canal into mammary glands of prepubertal dairy heifers; contralateral quarters were used as controls. After 7 d of treatment, bromodeoxyuridine was infused intravenously and heifers were slaughtered ~2 h later. Tissue from 3 regions of the mammary parenchyma was collected and immunostained for bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU), proliferating cell nuclear antigen (Ki-67), and caspase-3. Leptin decreased the number of mammary epithelial cells in the S-phase of the cell cycle by 48% in IGF-I-treated quarters and by 19% in saline-treated quarters. Leptin did not alter the number of mammary epithelial cells within the cell cycle, as indicated by Ki-67 labeling. Caspase-3 immunostaining within the mammary parenchyma was very low in these heifers, but leptin significantly increased labeling in saline-treated quarters. Leptin enhanced SOCS-3 expression in IGF-I-treated quarters but did not alter SOCS-1 or SOCS-5 expression. We conclude that a high concentration of leptin in the bovine mammary gland reduces proliferation of mammary epithelial cells. The reduced proliferation is accompanied by an increase in SOCS-3 expression, suggesting a possible mechanism for leptin inhibition of IGF-I action. Whether leptin might be a physiological regulator of mammogenesis remains to be determined. 3aheifers 3amammary glands 3aepithelial cells 3aleptin 3acell proliferation 3aapplication methods 3aenergy intake 3abody fat 3amammary development 3apuberty 3ainsulin-like growth factor I 3audder quarters 3aimmunohistochemistry 3aproliferating cell nuclear antigen 3aanimal proteins 3acaspase-3 0aintrammary infusion 0asuppressor of cytokine signalling-1 0asuppressor of cytokine signalling-51 aEtchebarne, B.E.1 aWeber Nielsen, M.S.1 aLiesman, J.S.1 aKiupel, Matti.1 aVandeHaar, M.J.0 tJournal of dairy science.g2008 Aug., v. 91, no. 8 p.3034-3044dAmerican Dairy Science Associationx0022-03027nnas  aDNAL  aOther US 7aarticle02676naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001700145245012900162300001600291500002400307520167200331650001402003650001202017650001302029650003302042650001902075700001502094700002502109700002302134700002002157700002202177773008202199852000902281856004802290655001202338IND4416989220221119113721.0090228e200903  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441698922DNAL7 a10.1007/s00425-008-0872-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSato, Mayuko14aThe dynamic surface of dividing cyanelles and ultrastructure of the region directly below the surface in Cyanophora paradoxa  ap. 781-791.  aIncludes references  aThe cyanelles of glaucocystophytes are probably the most primitive of known extant plastids and the closest to cyanobacteria. Their kidney shape and FtsZ arc during the early stage of division define cyanelle division. In order to deepen and expand earlier results (Planta 227:177-187, 2007), cells of Cyanophora paradoxa were fixed with two different chemical and two different freeze-fixation methods. In addition, cyanelles from C. paradoxa were isolated to observe the surface structure of dividing cyanelles using field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM). A shallow furrow started on one side of the division plane. The furrow subsequently extended, covering the entire division circle, and then invaginated deeply, becoming clearly visible. The typical FtsZ arc was 2.3-3.4 μm long. This length matches that of the cleavage furrow observed using FE-SEM. The cyanelle cleavage furrows are from one-fourth to one-half of the circumference of the division plane. The shallow furrow that appears on the cyanelle outer surface effectively changes the division plane. Using freeze-fixation methods, the electron-dense stroma and peptidoglycan could be distinguished. In addition, an electron-dense belt structure (the cyanelle ring) was observed inside the leading edge at the cyanelle division plane. The FtsZ arc is located at the division plane ahead of the cyanelle ring. Immunogold-TEM localization shows that FtsZ is located interiorly of the cyanelle ring. The lack of an outer PD ring, together with the arch-shaped furrow, suggests that the mechanical force of the initial (arch shaped) septum furrow constriction comes from inside the cyanelle. 3aemissions 3afurrows 3aplastids 3ascanning electron microscopy 3aultrastructure1 aMogi, Yuko1 aNishikawa, Toshikazu1 aMiyamura, Shinichi1 aNagumo, Tamotsu1 aKawano, Shigeyuki0 tPlanta.g2009 Mar., v. 229, no. 4 p.781-791dSpringer-Verlagx0032-09357nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00425-008-0872-4 7aarticle02205naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245009600126300001600222500001500238520099200253650002301245650002801268650001201296650002101308650001001329650002301339650002501362650001301387650001601400650001801416650000901434650002001443653002201463653002801485653002001513653002001533653001201553653002401565700002001589773007201609852000901681930003301690945001301723946001101736655001201747IND2200246520221119113536.0990823e199812  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220024652DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLongvah, T.10aEffect of dehulling, cooking and roasting on the protein quality of Perilla frutescens seed  ap. 519-523.  a2019-12-05  aThe effect of processing on the protein quality of Perilla frutescens was investigated.

Cooking increased the NPR, NPU and TDP significantly (p <0.05), whereas roasting exerted a negative effect. Dehulling significantly (p <0.05) increased the NPR, NPU and TDP. This study demonstrates that Perilla seed is a source of good quality protein that could be used in both human and animal nutrition. 3adigestible protein 3afood processing quality 3ahulling 3anutrient content 3aseeds 3aPerilla frutescens 3anutritional adequacy 3aroasting 3aamino acids 3aanimal models 3arats 3aprotein content 0anet protein ratio 0anet protein utilization 0anutritive value 0afood processing 0acooking 0aprotein composition1 aDeosthale, Y.G.0 tFood chemistry.g1998 Dec., v. 63, no. 4 p.519-523x0308-81467nnas  aDNAL  a19991003b19991007c00000000  aINDdHBI  aNon-US 7aarticle03832naa a2200745 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003100111040001800142072000900160072000900169072000900178100002300187245010300210300001800313500002400331500001500355520163100370650002302001650001602024650002702040650002802067650001402095650001802109650001802127650001702145650001302162650000902175650001602184650002302200650001902223650002102242650001502263650002902278650001202307650001302319650002102332650002402353650002502377650002602402650001102428650002802439650004102467650003202508650005502540650002202595650002202617650001702639653003202656653001502688700001502703700002002718700001602738700002302754700001602777773012002793852000902913856008102922930003303003945002503036946001303061655001203074IND4408260320221119113608.0080726e200808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440826032DNAL7 a186502882pmid7 a10.3168/jds.2007-09542doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL500 0aL100 0aQ5011 aGómez-Cortés, P.10aAddition of Olive Oil to Dairy Ewe Diets: Effect on Milk Fatty Acid Profile and Animal Performance  ap. 3119-3127.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe effects of ruminant diet supplementation with linoleic or different polyunsaturated fatty acids (FA) have been well documented. Less abundant information, however, exists on the effects of incorporating monounsaturated FA, such as oleic acid, on lipid metabolism or animal performance. The purpose of this work was to assess the effects of feeding dairy ewes a diet supplemented with high levels of olive oil (OO) on milk yield and composition, paying particular attention to the FA profile. Twenty-four Assaf ewes were fed ad libitum with 2 diets, control or supplemented with 6% OO (2 lots of 6 animals per diet) for 4 wk. Milk yield and composition and dry matter intake were recorded weekly. Milk FA composition was determined by gas chromatography and conjugated linoleic acid profile by silver ion HPLC. Milk yield increased in ewes receiving OO, with no differences in dry matter intake. The OO diet decreased the milk protein percentage but increased the milk fat, protein, and total solids yield. Medium-chain saturated FA (C10:0 to C16:0) content was reduced with OO supplementation, whereas C18:0 and cis-9 C18:1 content increased. Leaving aside trans-11, most trans C18:1 isomers, mainly trans-10, increased in supplemented ewes. The main conjugated linoleic acid isomer (cis-9, trans-11 C18:2) decreased with OO supplementation, whereas trans-7, cis-9 and trans-9, cis-11 C18:2 exhibited a remarkable increase. These results support the argument that the supplementation of ewe diets with high levels of OO does not have any detrimental effects on animal performance but substantially modifies the FA profile. 3amilk protein yield 3adietary fat 3afatty acid composition 3amilk protein percentage 3aolive oil 3adairy animals 3asheep feeding 3atotal solids 3amilk fat 3aewes 3afeed intake 3aad libitum feeding 3amilk fat yield 3alipid metabolism 3aoleic acid 3aconjugated linoleic acid 2aAnimals 2aDairying 2aDietxveterinary 2aDietary Supplements 2aEatingxdrug effects 2aFatty Acidsxanalysis 2aFemale 2aLactationxdrug effects 2aLinoleic Acids, Conjugatedxanalysis 2aMilkxchemistryxsecretion. 2aPlant Oilsxadministration & dosagexpharmacology. 2aRandom Allocation 2aSheepxphysiology 2aTime Factors 0amonounsaturated fatty acids 0amilk yield1 aFrutos, P.1 aMantecón, A.R.1 aJuárez, M.1 ade la Fuente, M.A.1 aHervás, G.0 tJournal of dairy science.g2008 Aug., v. 91, no. 8 p.3119-3127dAmerican Dairy Science Associationx0022-03027nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3168/jds.2007-09543Available from publisher's Web site  a20081023b20081101c00000000  aINDd2CTe2008/10/07  aOther US 7aarticle03387naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072002000110072002000130100001500150245013500165300001800300500002800318500001500346520207900361650002202440650001802462650002202480650001802502650003102520650001702551650001502568650002002583650000902603650001902612650001702631650001502648650002002663650001802683653001402701653003702715700001602752700001902768773012002787852000902907946001302916655001202929IND4408259820221119113518.0080726s2008    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440825982DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Platelet activating factor (PAF), interleukin 1β (IL-1β), IL-8, and intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM1) are among the several inflammatory factors involved in the early activation and migration of leukocytes into the mammary gland during the initial stages of coliform mastitis. Several different cell types within the mammary gland are capable of expressing these potent pro-inflammatory mediators. The objective of this study was to characterize the expression profile of vascular-derived inflammatory molecules that may play a role in the pathogenesis of bovine coliform mastitis. Isolated bovine mammary gland endothelial cells were stimulated in culture for up to 12 h with endotoxin obtained from Escherichia coli, and the temporal expression of proinflammatory cytokines and adhesion molecules relative to endogenous PAF biosynthesis was evaluated. Results from the in vitro time course experiment showed that vascular-derived PAF biosynthesis began as early as 30 min and peaked at 1 h following endotoxin challenge. The biosynthesis of PAF preceded the endotoxin-induced IL-1β, IL-8, and ICAM1 mRNA expression that increased after 1 h and reached peak expression between 4 and 12 h following stimulation. Inhibiting the effects of endogenous PAF with a receptor antagonist suggests that vascular-derived PAF is an early proinflammatory mediator that plays at least a partial role in the subsequent expression of IL-1β, IL-8, and ICAM1 during endotoxin challenge. Furthermore, endotoxin-induced PAF biosynthesis by bovine mammary gland endothelial cells is regulated to some extent by phospholipase D activity and phosphatidic acid production. The results from this study support the contention that mammary gland endothelial cells can contribute to the production of important proinflammatory mediators that are typically associated with coliform mastitis. 3acoliform bacteria 3amessenger RNA 3aendothelial cells 3ainterleukin-1 3aplatelet-activating factor 3ainflammation 3aleukocytes 3agene expression 3acows 3amammary glands 3apathogenesis 3aendotoxins 3abovine mastitis 3ainterleukin-8 0acytokines 0aintercellular adhesion molecules1 aGandy, J.C.1 aSordillo, L.M.0 tJournal of dairy science.g2008 Aug., v. 91, no. 8 p.3067-3078dAmerican Dairy Science Associationx0022-03027nnas  aDNAL  aOther US 7aarticle02806naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001500110245008900125300001600214500001500230520171800245650001901963650001601982650001301998650001902011650001802030650001302048650001502061650001702076650001102093650002002104650001302124651001202137653001102149653002202160700001702182700001702199773010002216852000902316930003302325945001302358946001302371655001202384IND2201241320221119113736.0991022e199903  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220124132DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHill, A.R.10aNitrogen chemistry of subsurface storm runoff on forested Canadian Shield hillslopes  ap. 811-821.  a2019-12-05  aThe nitrogen dynamics of storm runoff was studied using throughfall trenches on slopes with thin soils in a white pine forest catchment near Dorset, Ontario. Hydrologic data were combined with analysis of isotopic signatures and nitrogen chemistry in throughfall, soil water, and hillslope runoff. Two hypotheses were tested: (1) macropore preferential flow pathways are a source of nitrate flushing in storm runoff, and (2) the nitrogen chemistry of subsurface storm flow is controlled by the mixing of event water fluxes via macropores with preevent soil water. Most flow occurred at the soil-bedrock interface on the slopes, and the use of (18)O indicated that a considerable fraction of event water moved vertically to bedrock via preferential flow paths. Despite high levels of inorganic N in throughfall, subsurface runoff N losses during autumn storms were dominated by dissolved organic nitrogen, and little nitrate flushing occurred via preferential flow paths. Comparisons of observed NO3(-) and NH4+ concentrations versus concentrations predicted from the mixture of event and preevent water in subsurface flow did not support hypothesis 2 and instead indicated depletion of inorganic N. Low rates of N mineralization and negligible nitrification in surface 0-0.1 m soil during June-October suggested high biological utilization of a limited soil N supply. Laboratory experiments in which soil cores were leached with solutions containing NO3(-) and bromide confirmed that the organic Ae horizon was a sink for NO3(-). These data suggest that the biogeochemistry of the organic horizon can regulate patterns of inorganic N loss in subsurface runoff moving by preferential flow pathways in forest soils. 3amineralization 3athroughfall 3anitrogen 3amacropore flow 3anitrification 3aleaching 3asoil water 3aforest soils 3astorms 3asubsurface flow 3anitrates 3aOntario 0aslopes 0apreferential flow1 aButtle, J.M.1 aGoodyear, D.0 tWater resources research.g1999 Mar., v. 35, no. 3 p.811-821wJournal:jnl46306x0043-13977nnas  aDNAL  a19991201b19991209c00000000  aINDdGHK  aOther US 7aarticle03226naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001200145245019400157300001600351500002400367520185300391650002502244650001902269650002102288650001202309650001402321650001202335650001802347650002102365650001502386650001702401650001502418650001502433650002802448700001902476700001502495700001402510700001302524700001202537700001202549700001502561700001502576773010802591852000902699856004802708655001202756IND4410469620221119113808.0080919e200810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441046962DNAL7 a10.1007/s00122-008-0836-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLu, Kun10aCloning and characterization of phosphorus starvation inducible Brassica napus PURPLE ACID PHOSPHATASE 12 gene family, and imprinting of a recently evolved MITE-minisatellite twin structure  ap. 963-975.  aIncludes references  aPurple acid phosphatase (PAP) is important for phosphorus assimilation and in planta redistribution. In this study, seven Brassica napus PAP12 (BnPAP12) genes orthologous to Arabidopsis thaliana PAP12 (AtPAP12) are isolated and characterized. NCBI BLASTs, multi-alignments, conserved domain prediction, and featured motif/residue characterization indicate that all BnPAP12 members encode dimeric high molecular weight plant PAPs. BnPAP12-1, BnPAP12-2, BnPAP12-3 and BnPAP12-7 (Group I) have six introns and encode 469-aa polypeptides structurally comparable to AtPAP12. BnPAP12-4 and BnPAP12-6 (Group II) have seven introns and encode 526-aa PAP12s. Encoding a 475-aa polypeptide, BnPAP12-5 (Group III) is evolved from a chimera of 5' part of Group I and 3' part of Group II. Sequence characterization and Southern detection suggest that there are about five BnPAP12 alleles. Homoeologous non-allelic fragment exchanges exist among BnPAP12 genes. BnPAP12-4 and BnPAP12-6 are imprinted with a Tourist-like miniature inverted-repeat transposable element (MITE) which is tightly associated with a novel minisatellite composed of four 36-bp tandem repeats. Existing solely in B. rapa/oleracea lineage, this recently evolved MITE-minisatellite twin structure does not impair transcription and coding capacity of the imprinted genes, and could be used to identify close relatives of B. rapa/oleracea lineage within Brassica. It is also useful for studying MITE activities especially possible involvement in minisatellite formation and gene structure evolution. BnPAP12-6 is silent in transcription. All other BnPAP12 genes basically imitate AtPAP12 in tissue specificity and Pi-starvation induced expression pattern, but divergence and complementation are distinct among them. Alternative polyadenylation and intron retention also exist in BnPAP12 mRNAs. 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aBrassica napus 3aacid phosphatase 3aalleles 3aevolution 3aintrons 3amessenger RNA 3amolecular weight 3aphosphorus 3apolypeptides 3aprediction 3astarvation 3atandem repeat sequences1 aChai, You-Rong1 aZhang, Kai1 aWang, Rui1 aChen, Li1 aLei, Bo1 aLu, Jun1 aXu, Xin-Fu1 aLi, Jia-Na0 tTheoretical and applied genetics.g2008 Oct., v. 117, no. 6 p.963-975dSpringer-Verlagx0040-57527nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00122-008-0836-x 7aarticle03501naa a2200673 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003100111040001800142072000900160072000900169100001800178245010000196300001800296500002400314500001500338520150700353650002001860650001601880650002601896650001601922650002101938650001801959650001901977650001801996650002802014650001302042650001702055650001402072650002302086650001402109650002702123650002102150650001202171650001602183650002102199650002302220650005302243650002702296650001002323650002002333650001802353650002002371650003302391650002402424653002902448653002102477700001802498700001802516773012002534852000902654856008102663930003302744945002502777946001302802655001202815IND4408258420221119113658.0080726e200808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440825842DNAL7 a186502692pmid7 a10.3168/jds.2007-08732doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ501 0aQ1011 aPereira, R.N.10aGoat Milk Free Fatty Acid Characterization During Conventional and Ohmic Heating Pasteurization  ap. 2925-2937.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe disruption of the milk fat globule membrane can lead to an excessive accumulation of free fatty acids in milk, which is frequently associated with the appearance of rancid flavors. Solid-phase microextraction and gas chromatography techniques have been shown to be useful tools in the quantification of individual free fatty acids in dairy products providing enough sensitivity to detect levels of rancidity in milk. Therefore, the aim of this study was to characterize the short-chain and medium-chain free fatty acid profile in i) raw untreated goat milk; ii) raw goat milk passing through pumps and heating units (plate-and-frame heat exchanger and ohmic heater); and iii) processed goat milk by conventional and ohmic pasteurization to determine the influence of each treatment in the final quality of the milk. Multivariate statistical analysis has shown that the treatments studied were not responsible for the variability found on free fatty acid contents. In particular, it was possible to conclude that ohmic pasteurization at 72°C for 15 s did not promote an extended modification of free fatty acid contents in goat milk when compared with that of conventional pasteurization. Furthermore, principal component analysis showed that the capric acid can be used to discriminate goat's milk with different free fatty acid concentrations. Hierarchical cluster analysis showed evidence of the existence of correlations between contents of short and medium chain free fatty acids in goat milk. 3amicroextraction 3atemperature 3aquantitative analysis 3aoff flavors 3afree fatty acids 3aohmic heating 3apasteurization 3adecanoic acid 3ashort chain fatty acids 3amilk fat 3afat globules 3arancidity 3agas chromatography 3agoat milk 3asolid phase extraction 3apasteurized milk 2aAnimals 2aCalibration 2aCluster Analysis 2aElectric Impedance 2aFatty Acids, Nonesterifiedxanalysisxchemistry. 2aFood Handlingxmethods 2aGoats 2aHot Temperature 2aLinear Models 2aMilkxchemistry 2aPrincipal Component Analysis 2aReference Standards 0amedium chain fatty acids 0amilk composition1 aMartins, R.C.1 aVicente, A.A.0 tJournal of dairy science.g2008 Aug., v. 91, no. 8 p.2925-2937dAmerican Dairy Science Associationx0022-03027nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3168/jds.2007-08733Available from publisher's Web site  a20081023b20081101c00000000  aINDd2CTe2008/10/07  aOther US 7aarticle02133naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001500110245010200125300001800227520104900245650002801294650002101322650001501343650001301358650001601371650001601387650002501403653001301428653002601441653001501467653001601482653002401498700002601522700001401548700001701562773009001579852000901669930003301678945001301711946001101724655001201735IND2324174120221119113755.0011123e200109  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232417412DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSheeba, V.12aA case of multiple oscillators controlling different circadian rhythms in Drosophila melanogaster  ap. 1217-1225.  aA population of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster was raised in periodic light/dark (LD) cycles of 12:12 h for about 35 generations. Eclosion, locomotor activity, and oviposition were found to be rhythmic in these flies, when assayed in constant laboratory conditions where the light intensity, temperature, humidity and other factors which could possibly act as time cue for these flies, were kept constant. These rhythms also entrained to a LD cycle of 12:12 h in the laboratory with each of them adopting a different temporal niche. The free-running periods (tau) of the eclosion, locomotor activity and oviposition rhythms were significantly different from each other. The peak of eclosion and the onset of locomotor activity occurred during the light phase of the LD cycle, whereas the peak of oviposition was found to occur during the dark phase of the LD cycle. Based on these results, we conclude that different circadian oscillators control the eclosion, locomotor activity and oviposition rhythms in the fruit fly D. melanogaster. 3aDrosophila melanogaster 3acircadian rhythm 3alocomotion 3aeclosion 3aoviposition 3aphotoperiod 3atime series analysis 0aactivity 0acircadian oscillators 0apacemakers 0aentrainment 0afree-running period1 aChandrashekaran, M.K.1 aJoshi, A.1 aSharma, V.K.0 tJournal of insect physiology.g2001 Sept., v. 47, no. 10 p.1217-1225x0022-19107nnas  aDNAL  a20020204b20020208c00000000  aINDdNZM  aNon-US 7aarticle03233naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002800092040001800120100002300138245009200161300001800253500002400271520186300295650003102158650001302189650001202202650001502214650001402229650001402243650001302257650001002270650002002280650001002300650001102310650001402321650001102335650001502346650001402361650001002375700002002385700001802405700002202423700001702445700002102462700002302483700003002506773011602536852000902652856007802661655001202739IND4428181220221119113738.0091106e200911  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442818122DNAL7 a10.1093/jxb/erp2692doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShetty, Nandini P.10aEffects of β-1,3-glucan from Septoria tritici on structural defence responses in wheat  ap. 4287-4300.  aIncludes references  aThe accumulation of the pathogenesis-related (PR) proteins β-1,3-glucanase and chitinase and structural defence responses were studied in leaves of wheat either resistant or susceptible to the hemibiotrophic pathogen Septoria tritici. Resistance was associated with an early accumulation of β-1,3-glucanase and chitinase transcripts followed by a subsequent reduction in level. Resistance was also associated with high activity of β-1,3-glucanase, especially in the apoplastic fluid, in accordance with the biotrophic/endophytic lifestyle of the pathogen in the apoplastic spaces, thus showing the highly localized accumulation of defence proteins in the vicinity of the pathogen. Isoform analysis of β-1,3-glucanase from the apoplastic fluid revealed that resistance was associated with the accumulation of an endo-β-1,3-glucanase, previously implicated in defence against pathogens, and a protein with identity to ADPG pyrophosphatase (92%) and germin-like proteins (93%), which may be involved in cell wall reinforcement. In accordance with this, glycoproteins like extensin were released into the apoplast and callose accumulated to a greater extent in cell walls, whereas lignin and polyphenolics were not found to correlate with defence. Treatment of a susceptible wheat cultivar with purified β-1,3-glucan fragments from cell walls of S. tritici gave complete protection against disease and this was accompanied by increased gene expression of β-1,3-glucanase and the deposition of callose. Collectively, these data indicate that resistance is dependent on a fast, initial recognition of the pathogen, probably due to β-1,3-glucan in the fungal cell walls, and this results in the accumulation of β-1,3-glucanase and structural defence responses, which may directly inhibit the pathogen and protect the host against fungal enzymes and toxins. 3aMycosphaerella graminicola 3aapoplast 3acallose 3acell walls 3achitinase 3acultivars 3aextensin 3afungi 3agene expression 3ahosts 3aleaves 3alifestyle 3alignin 3amycotoxins 3apathogens 3awheat1 aJensen, Jens D.1 aKnudsen, Anne1 aFinnie, Christine1 aGeshi, Naomi1 aBlennow, Andreas1 aCollinge, David B.1 aJørgensen, Hans J.

Age at puberty is important as a production trait when heifers are bred to calve as 2-yr-olds and in systems that impose restricted breeding periods. Calving by 24 mo of age is necessary to obtain maximum lifetime productivity. Because the reproductive system is the last major organ system to mature, factors that influence puberty are critical. The influence of environment on the sequence of events leading to puberty in the heifer is dictated largely by the nutritional status of the animal and related effects on growth rate and development. Management strategies have been designed to ensure that heifers reach a prebreeding target weight that supports optimum reproductive performance, and consequences of inadequate or excessive development have been evaluated. Those strategies are based on evidence linking postweaning nutritional development with key reproductive events that include age at puberty and first breeding, conception, pregnancy loss, incidence and severity of dystocia, and postpartum interval to estrus. Management alternatives that ultimately affect lifetime productivity and reproductive performance of heifers begin at birth and include decisions that involve growth-promoting implants, creep-feeding, breed type and(or) species, birth date and weaning weight, social interaction, sire selection, and exogenous hormonal treatments to synchronize or induce estrus. Basic and applied future research efforts should converge to match in a realistic manner the production potential of the animal with available resources. Strategies that incorporate consideration of nutrition, genetics, and emerging management techniques will need to be tested to enable producers to make decisions that result in profit. This review evaluates the current status of knowledge relating to management of the replacement beef heifer and serves to stimulate research needed to enhance management techniques to ensure puberty at an optimal age. 3areproduction 3aheifers 3abeef cows 3apuberty 3aage 3anutritional status 3aprogestational hormones 3acrossbreds 3aweaning weight 2aAnimal Feed 2aAnimal Husbandry 2aAnimals 2aAnimals, Sucklingxgrowth & development 2aBreeding 2aCattlexgeneticsxgrowth & developmentxphysiology. 2aFemale 2aMale 2aReproductionxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aSexual Maturationxgenetics 2aSocial Behavior 2aWeaning 0aliterature reviews1 aPerry, R.C.1 aKiracofe, G.H.1 aBellows, R.A.1 aStaigmiller, R.B.1 aCorah, L.R.0 tJournal of animal science.g1992 Dec., v. 70, no. 12 p.4018-4035x0021-88127nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02402naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100002100128245013500149300001600284500001500300520089900315650002601214650001301240650002901253650001201282650003201294650001201326650001801338650001401356650002901370650001501399650001101414650003701425650002301462650002301485650003401508650004201542650004901584650002401633650003701657653000801694653001401702700001401716700001801730700001401748773006701762852000901829939003301838946001301871655001201884IND9301385920221119113803.0930308e199210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND930138592DNAL7 a13257082pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShoji-Tanaka, A.10aIn vitro accurate transcription from the cap site of bovine leukemia virus (BLV) dependent on the BLV-infected cell nuclear lysate  ap. 834-839.  a2019-12-04  aThe cell-free transcriptional system initiating from the cap site in bovine leukemia virus (BLV) LTR by RNA polymerase 11 was constructed.

Our approach is based on an extension of the Priestley-Taylor equation and a relationship between remotely sensed surface temperature and vegetation index. The required parameters for this approach are derived from advanced very high resolution radiometer NOAA 14 data over the southern Great Plains (SGP) in 1997. Compared to ground flux observations by the Atmospheric Radiation Measurement program, our six case studies varying from early spring to late summer over the SGP domain show that the proposed method provides better estimation accuracy for surface evaporation than the original Priestley-Taylor method. It appears that the proposed method can estimate evaporation over large areas with significantly less complexity than that of the traditionally used residual method based on aerodynamic resistance. The uncertainty in the estimation of surface evaporation for the proposed approach is closely related to the inaccuracy in deriving net radiation and soil heat flux from remote sensing data. Results suggest that the proposed approach is more reliable and easily applicable for operational estimation of evaporation over large areas where ground-based data are not readily available. 3aestimation 3aequations 3aevaporation 3aremote sensing 3aOklahoma 3aKansas 0asurface layers 0apriestley-taylor equation 0agreat plains states of usa1 aIslam, S.0 tWater resources research.g2001 Feb., v. 37, no. 2 p.329-340x0043-13977nnas  aDNAL  a20021002b20021010c00000000  aINDdGHK  aOther US 7aarticle02929naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110245010100128300001600229500001500245520188200260650003702142650002502179650002302204650001402227650001702241650000902258650000902267650001902276653001902295653001802314653001702332653001102349700001502360773010002375852000902475930003302484945001302517946001302530655001202543IND2328766320221119113916.0020830e200102  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232876632DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAssouline, S.10aSoil seal formation and its effect on infiltration: uniform versus nonuniform seal approximation  ap. 297-305.  a2019-12-05  aTwo different approaches to the solution of the problem of flow through the dynamic stage of seal formation as well as through soil with a fully developed seal are studied. The first approach considers the disturbed seal layer and the undisturbed soil underneath as a continuous nonuniform soil profile. The second replaces the nonuniform seal by a uniform equivalent layer, thereby generating a homogeneous two-layer flow system. The depth-dependent properties of the nonuniform seal are expressed in terms of the exponential model of Mualem and Assouline [1989]. The dynamics of seal formation are modeled according to Assouline and Mualem [1997]. During the first rainfall on an undisturbed soil profile, when the seal layer is formed, the application of the first or the second approach has only a minor effect on the calculated infiltration curves. However, there is a significant difference between the two solutions regarding the dynamic changes of the water content in the soil surface and, consequently, within the seal layer. During subsequent rainfalls on a sealed soil profile, when the seal layer is completely developed, the differences between the two ways of accounting for the seal layer become evident, and their effects on the infiltration curve are much more significant. Representing the seal as an equivalent uniform layer increases the ponding time and the infiltration rates at the early stage of the process. The amplitude of these effects is increased when the rainfall rate is higher and the seal layer is thicker. An important result is that the relationship between infiltration rate and cumulative infiltration is unique in the case of a completely developed seal and when the seal is considered as a nonuniform layer. However, this relationship is not unique during seal formation, independent of the approach applied to represent the seal layer. 3asaturated hydraulic conductivity 3asoil surface sealing 3asoil water content 3aequations 3abulk density 3aflow 3arain 3arain intensity 0asurface layers 0acrusted soils 0ainfiltration 0acrusts1 aMualem, Y.0 tWater resources research.g2001 Feb., v. 37, no. 2 p.297-305wJournal:jnl46306x0043-13977nnas  aDNAL  a20021002b20021010c00000000  aINDdGHK  aOther US 7aarticle04042naa a2200721 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002700111040001800138072000900156100001400165245011500179300001800294500002400312500001500336520186100351650001602212650001502228650001502243650002202258650002402280650003002304650001502334650001302349650001302362650001202375650001302387650002402400650001402424650002502438650001802463650003502481650001502516650002802531650004302559650002302602650003902625650003202664650003102696650004002727653002702767653000802794653001402802653001602816653001602832653002302848653001002871653003702881700001302918700001202931700001702943700001402960700001402974773016302988852000903151856007703160930003303237945002503270946001303295655001203308IND4408298220221119112345.0080728e20080723xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440829822DNAL7 a185704322pmid7 a10.1021/jf800033k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF2001 aZhang, H.10aDevelopment of One Novel Multiple-Target Plasmid for Duplex Quantitative PCR Analysis of Roundup Ready Soybean  ap. 5514-5520.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aTo enforce the labeling regulations of genetically modified organisms (GMOs), the application of reference molecules as calibrators is becoming essential for practical quantification of GMOs. However, the reported reference molecules with tandem marker multiple targets have been proved not suitable for duplex PCR analysis. In this study, we developed one unique plasmid molecule based on one pMD-18T vector with three exogenous target DNA fragments of Roundup Ready soybean GTS 40-3-2 (RRS), that is, CaMV35S, NOS, and RRS event fragments, plus one fragment of soybean endogenous Lectin gene. This Lectin gene fragment was separated from the three exogenous target DNA fragments of RRS by inserting one 2.6 kb DNA fragment with no relatedness to RRS detection targets in this resultant plasmid. Then, we proved that this design allows the quantification of RRS using the three duplex real-time PCR assays targeting CaMV35S, NOS, and RRS events employing this reference molecule as the calibrator. In these duplex PCR assays, the limits of detection (LOD) and quantification (LOQ) were 10 and 50 copies, respectively. For the quantitative analysis of practical RRS samples, the results of accuracy and precision were similar to those of simplex PCR assays, for instance, the quantitative results were at the 1% level, the mean bias of the simplex and duplex PCR were 4.0% and 4.6%, respectively, and the statistic analysis (t-test) showed that the quantitative data from duplex and simplex PCR had no significant discrepancy for each soybean sample. Obviously, duplex PCR analysis has the advantages of saving the costs of PCR reaction and reducing the experimental errors in simplex PCR testing. The strategy reported in the present study will be helpful for the development of new reference molecules suitable for duplex PCR quantitative assays of GMOs. 3aGlycine max 3atransgenes 3abiomarkers 3atransgenic plants 3agenetic improvement 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aherbicides 3asoybeans 3aplasmids 3alectins 3avalidity 3areference standards 3ascreening 2aDNA, Plantxanalysis 2aFood Labeling 2aGlycinexanalogs & derivatives 2aHerbicides 2aPlant Lectinsxgenetics 2aPlants, Genetically Modifiedxgenetics 2aPlasmidsxgenetics 2aPolymerase Chain Reactionxmethods 2aSensitivity and Specificity 2aSoybean Proteinsxgenetics 2aSoybeansxclassificationxgenetics. 0aRoundup Ready soybeans 0aDNA 0ametrology 0amethodology 0anew methods 0amolecular genetics 0agenes 0aduplex polymerase chain reaction1 aYang, L.1 aGuo, J.1 aLi, Xunjing.1 aJiang, L.1 aZhang, D.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2008 July 23, v. 56, no. 14 p.5514-5520dAmerican Chemical Society, Books and Journals Division]x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf800033k3Available from publisher's Web site  a20090610b20090703c00000000  aINDd4CTe2009/05/04  aOther US 7aarticle02934naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119072000900137072000900146100002500155245010300180300001600283500018900299500002400488500001500512520130000527650001801827650001801845650002001863650002501883650001201908650002201920650001901942650002301961650001601984650002102000650001702021651001002038653002502048653001602073653002502089653001402114700002602128773011702154852000902271856007702280930003302357945002502390946001302415655001202428IND4408282320221119112404.0080726s2008    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440828232DNAL7 a10.1002/agr.201692doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aE720 0aE7001 aBanterle, Alessandro10aInformation, labelling, and vertical coordination: an analysis of the Italian meat supply networks  ap. 320-331.  aIn the special issue: Innovation and system dynamics in food networks / edited by M.

The purpose of this article is to evaluate whether voluntary traceability labelling, introduced by Regulation 1760/2000, can be considered a useful instrument for both the producers and consumers of meat products. Attention is focused on the vertical coordination effects of introducing voluntary labelling along the beef chain and on the interest the Italian consumer shows in labelled information on meat products. Two surveys were conducted: one addressing Italian meat organizations that signed voluntary labelling agreements and the other a sample of 1,025 Italian consumers. With regard to supply, the survey revealed that improved traceability led to a better redistribution of liability among the agents of the meat supply chain and to a strengthening of vertical agreements. Regarding the consumers, the results showed a notable consumer interest in the labelled information such as the meat origin and the information related to the system of cattle breeding, cattle feeding, and the date of slaughtering. 3ameat products 3afood labeling 3arisk management 3aconsumer information 3asurveys 3afood availability 3aEuropean Union 3aconsumer attitudes 3afood safety 3ahuman food chain 3atraceability 3aItaly 0avoluntary agreements 0afood supply 0afood supply networks 0aliability1 aStranieri, Stefanella0 tAgribusiness.g2008, v. 24, no. 3 p.320-331dWiley Subscription Services, Inc., A Wiley Companyx0742-44777nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/agr.201693Available from publisher's Web site  a20080917b20081011c00000000  aINDd2CTe2008/09/03  aOther US 7aarticle03228naa a2200625 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002700111040001800138072000900156072000900165072000900174100002200183245010900205300001800314500002400332500001500356520132500371650002501696650001601721650002501737650003601762650001301798650001601811650001301827650001501840650002201855650001801877650002201895650002201917650001601939650001601955650001901971650001701990650002302007650001502030650002502045650003502070650002702105650003202132650002202164653001402186653003402200653002002234700001602254773016302270852000902433856007702442930003302519945002502552946001302577655001202590IND4408297420221119112506.0080728e20080723xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440829742DNAL7 a185729522pmid7 a10.1021/jf800069p2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ500 0aX100 0aQ4001 aLachenmeier, D.W.10aMultivariate Curve Resolution of Spectrophotometric Data for the Determination of Artificial Food Colors  ap. 5463-5468.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aIn the analysis of food additives, past emphasis was put on the development of chromatographic techniques to separate target components from a complex matrix. Especially in the case of artificial food colors, direct spectrophotometric measurement was seen to lack in specificity due to a high spectral overlap between different components. Multivariate curve resolution (MCR) may be used to overcome this limitation. MCR is able to (i) extract from a complex spectral feature the number of involved components, (ii) attribute the resulting spectra to chemical compounds, and (iii) quantify the individual spectral contributions with or without a priori knowledge. We have evaluated MCR for the routine analysis of yellow and blue food colors in absinthe spirits. Using calibration standards, we were able to show that MCR equally performs as compared to partial least-squares regression but with much improved chemical information contained in the predicted spectra. MCR was then applied to an authentic collective of different absinthes. As confirmed by reference analytics, the food colors were correctly assigned with a sensitivity of 0.93 and a specificity of 0.85. Besides the artificial colors, the algorithm detected a further component in some samples that could be assigned to natural coloring from chlorophyll. 3achemical composition 3acalibration 3aArtemisia absinthium 3achemical constituents of plants 3aaccuracy 3afood matrix 3avalidity 3aalgorithms 3adistilled spirits 3adata analysis 3aspectral analysis 3aartificial colors 3ameasurement 3achlorophyll 3afood additives 3aspectroscopy 2aAbsinthexanalysis 2aAlgorithms 2aAnalysis of Variance 2aFood Coloring Agentsxanalysis 2aLeast-Squares Analysis 2aSensitivity and Specificity 2aSpectrophotometry 0ametrology 0amultivariate curve resolution 0aproduct quality1 aKessler, W.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2008 July 23, v. 56, no. 14 p.5463-5468dAmerican Chemical Society, Books and Journals Division]x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf800069p3Available from publisher's Web site  a20090610b20090703c00000000  aINDd4CTe2009/05/04  aOther US 7aarticle02842naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119072000900137072000900146072000900155100001500164245016800179300001800347500002400365500001500389520105200404650001001456650002301466650002301489650001101512650002001523650001201543650001301555650001001568650002601578650002301604650002301627650002701650650002701677650002001704650001401724650001201738650001501750650002001765653001201785653002301797653002101820700001601841700001601857700002901873700001801902773016301920852000902083856007702092930003302169945002502202946001302227655001202240IND4408300220140724000000.0080728e20080723xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440830022DNAL7 a10.1021/jf800787y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF600 0aF200 0aQ5041 aTaylor, M.10aSeed Storage Protein Deficiency Improves Sulfur Amino Acid Content in Common Bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.): Redirection of Sulfur from γ-Glutamyl-S-methyl-cysteine  ap. 5647-5654.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe contents of sulfur amino acids in seeds of common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) are suboptimal for nutrition. They accumulate large amounts of a γ-glutamyl dipeptide of S-methyl-cysteine, a nonprotein amino acid that cannot substitute for methionine or cysteine in the diet. Protein accumulation and amino acid composition were characterized in three genetically related lines integrating a progressive deficiency in major seed storage proteins, phaseolin, phytohemagglutinin, and arcelin. Nitrogen, carbon, and sulfur contents were comparable among the three lines. The contents of S-methyl-cysteine and γ-glutamyl-S-methyl-cysteine were progressively reduced in the mutants. Sulfur was shifted predominantly to the protein cysteine pool, while total methionine was only slightly elevated. Methionine and cystine contents (mg per g protein) were increased by up to ca. 40%, to levels slightly above FAO guidelines on amino acid requirements for human nutrition. These findings may be useful to improve the nutritional quality of common bean. 3abeans 3aPhaseolus vulgaris 3aphytohemagglutinin 3asulfur 3anutrient uptake 3aarcelin 3acysteine 3aseeds 3anutrient deficiencies 3astrain differences 3anutrient retention 3aamino acid composition 3anonprotein amino acids 3anutritive value 3aphaseolin 3amutants 3amethionine 3aprotein content 0astrains 0asulfur amino acids 0astorage proteins1 aChapman, R.1 aBeyaert, R.1 aHernández-Sebastià, C.1 aMarsolais, F.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2008 July 23, v. 56, no. 14 p.5647-5654dAmerican Chemical Society, Books and Journals Division]x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf800787y3Available from publisher's Web site  a20090610b20090703c00000000  aINDd4CTe2009/05/06  aOther US 7aarticle02096naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110245007700128300001600205500001500221520090200236650001701138650001201155650002601167650001801193650002301211650001901234650002001253650001501273650001301288650001101301650002001312650001501332650002301347650001301370653001101383653001901394653002301413653002101436653001901457653001201476773007201488852000901560930003301569945001301602946001101615655001201626IND2200009620221119112452.0990805e199810  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220000962DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMahoney, R.R.10aGalactosyl-oligosaccharide formation during lactose hydrolysis: a review  ap. 147-154.  a2019-12-05  aEnzymatic hydrolysis of lactose is accompanied by galactosyl transfer to other sugars, thereby producing oligosaccharides. These are hydrolyzed slowly, both in vitro and in vivo. They can be thought of as low molecular weight, non-viscous, water-soluble, dietary fibre. They are considered to be physiologically functional foods which promote the growth of bifidobacteria in the colon and a wide variety of health benefits has been claimed in connection with this effect. This article reviews the mechanism of oligosaccharide formation, and then discusses the amount and nature of the products as well as the factors which influence them. The appearance and disappearance of oligosaccharides is explored through consideration of the kinetics of tranferase activity. The consequences of oligosaccharide formation for dairy processing, food analysis, nutrition and health are then briefly discussed. 3afermentation 3alactose 3aquantitative analysis 3afood analysis 3abeta-galactosidase 3afermented milk 3afood processing 3ahydrolysis 3akinetics 3ayields 3aenzyme activity 3aseparation 3achemical structure 3abacteria 0asugars 0aimmobilization 0aliterature reviews 0aoligosaccharides 0adairy products 0asources0 tFood chemistry.g1998 Oct., v. 63, no. 2 p.147-154x0308-81467nnas  aDNAL  a19990901b19990909c00000000  aINDdHBI  aNon-US 7aarticle03716naa a2200649 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002700111040001800138072000900156072000900165072000900174100001800183245014500201300001800346500002400364500001500388520169900403650002702102650001402129650003702143650001402180650002802194650001302222650001102235650001002246650001302256650003202269650002502301650002102326650002302347650001602370650002702386650001902413650002402432650002702456650002102483650002502504650002702529650002002556650002502576650005302601650002002654651001102674653001602685653001502701700001802716773016302734852000902897856007702906930003302983945002503016946001303041655001203054IND4408301420221119112357.0080728e20080723xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440830142DNAL7 a185587092pmid7 a10.1021/jf703783u2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ205 0aH000 0aQ1051 aAmvrazi, E.G.10aMulticlass Pesticide Determination in Olives and Their Processing Factors in Olive Oil: Comparison of Different Olive Oil Extraction Systems  ap. 5700-5709.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe processing factors (pesticide concentration found in olive oil/pesticide concentration found in olives) of azinphos methyl, chlorpyrifos, λ-cyhalothrin, deltamethrin, diazinon, dimethoate, endosulfan, and fenthion were determined in olive oil production process in various laboratory-scale olive oil extractions based on three- or two-phase centrifugation systems in comparison with samples collected during olive oil extractions in conventional olive mills located at different olive oil production areas in Greece. Pesticide analyses were performed using a multiresidue method developed in our laboratory for the determination of different insecticides and herbicides in olive oil by solid-phase extraction techniques coupled to gas chromatography detection (electron capture detection and nitrogen phosphorus detection), optimized, and validated for olive fruits sample preparation. Processing factors were found to vary among the different pesticides studied. Water addition in the oil extraction procedure (as in a three-phase centrifugation system) was found to decrease the processing factors of dimethoate, α-endosulfan, diazinon, and chlorpyrifos, whereas those of fenthion, azinphos methyl, β-endosulfan, λ-cyhalothrin, and deltamethrin residues were not affected. The water content of olives processed was found to proportionally affect pesticide processing factors. Fenthion sulfoxide and endosulfan sulfate were the major metabolites of fenthion and endosulfan, respectively, that were detected in laboratory-produced olive oils, but only the concentration of fenthion sulfoxide was found to increase with the increase of water addition in the olive oil extraction process. 3achemical concentration 3adetection 3aorganothiophosphate insecticides 3aolive oil 3apyrethroid insecticides 3avalidity 3aolives 3awater 3asolvents 3aorganochlorine insecticides 3ainsecticide residues 3atoxicity testing 3agas chromatography 3afood safety 3asolid phase extraction 3acentrifugation 2aChromatography, Gas 2aFood Handlingxmethods 2aFruitxchemistry 2aHerbicidesxanalysis 2aInsecticidesxanalysis 2aOleaxchemistry 2aPesticidesxanalysis 2aPlant Oilsxchemistryxisolation & purification. 2aWaterxanalysis 3aGreece 0amethodology 0aextraction1 aAlbanis, T.A.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2008 July 23, v. 56, no. 14 p.5700-5709dAmerican Chemical Society, Books and Journals Division]x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf703783u3Available from publisher's Web site  a20090611b20090703c00000000  aINDd4CTe2009/05/07  aOther US 7aarticle01848naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001500110245008500125300001600210520080200226650001401028650001801042650002001060650001701080650002101097650002501118650001101143650002701154651001001181653001101191700001701202700001801219700001401237700001901251700001401270700001601284773007201300852000901372930003301381945001301414946001101427655001201438IND2199966720221119112439.0990802e199807  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND219996672DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBianco, A.10aMicrocomponents of olive oil.

They are characterized by a low polarity, despite the presence of a diglycosidic unit, giving, in water, micelles. Because of this characteristic, compounds 1 and 2 could be responsible for the stability of the light emulsion typical of freshly produced olive oil. The presence of hydrophilic ortho-diphenolic compounds enhances the antioxidant properties of this oil, particularly in the first period after the production. In addition, the functions present in 1 and 2 are susceptible to hydrolysis and may be easily modified in the alkaline treatment used for the olive oil refining process. For this reason, their presence in olive oil may be a very useful indication of the untreated food product. 3aolive oil 3aOlea europaea 3adiacylglycerols 3acerebrosides 3afood composition 3achemical composition 3aleaves 3amolecular conformation 3aItaly 0afruits1 aMazzei, R.A.1 aMelchioni, C.1 aLuisa, M.1 aScarpati, M.L.1 aRomeo, G.1 aUccella, N.0 tFood chemistry.g1998 July, v. 62, no. 3 p.343-346x0308-81467nnas  aDNAL  a19990901b19990909c00000000  aINDdHBI  aNon-US 7aarticle01691naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003000092024002200122024001900144040001800163100001900181245007600200300001800276500002400294506007600318520044800394506003700842650002300879650001300902650001500915650003300930650001200963650001800975700002800993700002101021700001901042700001901061773013601080852000901216856008001225655001201305IND4408443020221207110929.0080801e20080801xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440844302DNAL7 a10.1128/AEM.00117-082doi7 aPMC25193382pmcid7 a185397892pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLarsen, Rasmus10aTranscriptome Analysis of the Lactococcus lactis ArgR and AhrC Regulons  ap. 4768-4771.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aIn previous studies, we have shown that direct protein-protein interaction between the two regulators ArgR and AhrC in Lactococcus lactis is required for arginine-dependent repression of the biosynthetic argC promoter and the activation of the catabolic arcA promoter.

The quality deterioration was mainly due to mechanical injury and non-selective plucking with shear-harvesting. However, tea obtained by shear-harvesting from a continuously sheared field over a prolonged period was found to be superior. The use of shears reduced the yield and increased the plucking average with a net decrease in cost of production compared to hand plucking. 3ashears 3achemical composition 3afood processing quality 3asensory evaluation 3afatty acids 3avolatile compounds 3ablack tea 3afood composition 3aflavor compounds 3amechanical harvesting 3aleaves 3aIndia 0atea 0aplucking 0afood quality 0acrush tear and curl1 aParthiban, R.0 tFood chemistry.g1998 Sept., v. 63, no. 1 p.61-64x0308-81467nnas  aDNAL  a19990901b19990909c00000000  aINDdHBI  aNon-US 7aarticle03283naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003000092024002200122024001900144040001800163100002400181245012400205300001800329500002400347506007600371520173100447506003702178650003202215650001402247650001602261650001202277650001602289650002802305650001102333650001402344650001502358650002002373650003002393650001302423700002102436700001902457700003002476700002402506700002702530700001802557773013702575852000902712856008002721655001202801IND4458872820221207110940.0110610e20110615xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445887282DNAL7 a10.1128/AEM.02993-102doi7 aPMC31316542pmcid7 a215157332pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGilmour, Cynthia C.10aSulfate-Reducing Bacterium Desulfovibrio desulfuricans ND132 as a Model for Understanding Bacterial Mercury Methylation  ap. 3938-3951.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aWe propose the use of Desulfovibrio desulfuricans ND132 as a model species for understanding the mechanism of microbial Hg methylation. Strain ND132 is an anaerobic dissimilatory sulfate-reducing bacterium (DSRB), isolated from estuarine mid-Chesapeake Bay sediments. It was chosen for study because of its exceptionally high rates of Hg methylation in culture and its metabolic similarity to the lost strain D. desulfuricans LS, the only organism for which methylation pathways have been partially defined. Strain ND132 is an incomplete oxidizer of short-chain fatty acids. It is capable of respiratory growth using fumarate as an electron acceptor, supporting growth without sulfide production. We used enriched stable Hg isotopes to show that ND132 simultaneously produces and degrades methylmercury (MeHg) during growth but does not produce elemental Hg. MeHg produced by cells is mainly excreted, and no MeHg is produced in spent medium. Mass balances for Hg and MeHg during the growth of cultures, including the distribution between filterable and particulate phases, illustrate how medium chemistry and growth phase dramatically affect Hg solubility and availability for methylation. The available information on Hg methylation among strains in the genus Desulfovibrio is summarized, and we present methylation rates for several previously untested species. About 50% of Desulfovibrio strains tested to date have the ability to produce MeHg. Importantly, the ability to produce MeHg is constitutive and does not confer Hg resistance. A 16S rRNA-based alignment of the genus Desulfovibrio allows the very preliminary assessment that there may be some evolutionary basis for the ability to produce MeHg within this genus.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDesulfovibrio desulfuricans 3aelectrons 3afatty acids 3amercury 3amethylation 3amethylmercury compounds 3amodels 3asediments 3asolubility 3astable isotopes 3asulfate-reducing bacteria 3asulfides1 aElias, Dwayne A.1 aKucken, Amy M.1 aBrown, S.

Only strictly reproducible isotopic fractionation will ensure that the fermentation products are always representative of their lactose precursor. An analytical strategy has therefore been designed that avoids discriminating isotope effects in the fermentation of pure lactose or whey permeates by Kluyveromyces fragilis. Appropriate experimental conditions ensure nearly full consumption of lactose and a high yield of conversion into ethanol. A lactose concentration of the order of magnitude of that found in whey permeates (50 g l-1) is convenient and an inoculum grown for 24 h is selected. Whereas sodium ions exert an inhibitory effect, added peptones optimize the fermentation process without introducing isotopic perturbations. The overall carbon isotope parameter of ethanol, delta 13C, is measured by isotope ratio mass spectrometry with a reproducibility of 0.2 per thousand and the site-specific natural isotope ratios of the methyl, (D/H)I, and methylene, (D/H)II, sites of ethanol are obtained with a reproducibility of about 1.5 ppm. These parameters provide useful criteria for comparing various starting materials such as lactoses (alpha or beta) from different commercial producers, milk powders, ordinary or skimmed milks and lactoserum. The methyl parameter, (D/H)I, mainly reflects the deuterium content of the lactose precursor, which is itself expected to provide information on the feeding of the animal and on the metabolism.

NIH3T3 and human mammary epithelial cells were incubated with lovastatin and [2-14C]mevalonolactone in the absence and presence of limonene. Labeled proteins were then subjected to sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and fluorography. Limonene inhibited isoprenylation of a class of cellular proteins of 21-26 kDa, including p21ras and possibly other small GTP-binding proteins, in a dose-dependent manner in both cell lines. In contrast, limonene did not affect the isoprenylation of several other proteins, including nuclear lamins. Limonene is metabolized extensively in vivo but not in cultured cells. The two major rat serum metabolites of limonene, perillic acid and dihydroperillic acid, were more potent than limonene in the inhibition of isoprenylation. These results demonstrate that limonene selectively inhibits isoprenylation of 21-26-kDa proteins at a point in the mevalonic acid pathway distal to 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase, and they provide a plausible explanation for its chemotherapeutic activity. Inhibition of isoprenylation of proteins such as p21ras and other small GTP-binding proteins would alter their intracellular localization and, hence, disrupt their biological activity. 3amammary neoplasms (animal) 3alimonene 3aantineoplastic agents 3acell lines 3achemical reactions 2aAnimals 2aButadienesxmetabolism 2aCell Line 2aCholesterolxbiosynthesis 2aCyclohexenes 2aHemiterpenes 2aMice 2aMolecular Structure 2aPentanes 2aPhosphorylation 2aPolyisoprenyl Phosphatesxmetabolism 2aProtein Processing, Post-Translational 2aProto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras)xmetabolism 2aStructure-Activity Relationship 2aTerpenesxmetabolismxpharmacology. 0ainhibition 0aorange peel1 aChang, R.R.1 aRen, Z.1 aElson, C.E.1 aGould, M.N.0 tJournal of biological chemistry.g1991 Sept. 15, v. 266, no. 26 p.17679-17685x0021-92587nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03071naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002100110040001800131100002900149245008200178300001800260500001500278520157100293650001901864650002201883650003001905650001101935650001001946650002101956650001201977650001401989650005302003650002302056650002302079650004002102650003302142650002402175650002202199650003902221650002302260650004502283650003602328653003002364700001502394700001602409773008502425852000902510939003302519946001302552655001202565IND9202113920221119112228.0920413e199110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920211392DNAL7 a16557162pmid7 aPMC2089912pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRodriguez-Palenzuela, P.10aPolygalacturonase is a virulence factor in Agrobacterium tumefaciens biovar 3  ap. 6547-6552.  a2019-12-04  aAgrobacterium tumefaciens biovar 3 causes both crown gall and root decay of grapes. All biovar 3 strains, regardless of their tumorigenicity, produce in culture a single polygalacturonase with a pI around 4.5. A. tumefaciens biovar 3 strain CG49 was mutagenized with Tn5 by using pSUP2021 as a suicide vector. A mutant strain, CG50, lacking polygalacturonase activity was isolated. The mutation was due to a single Tn5 insertion in an 8.5-kb EcoRI fragment that also contained the polygalacturonase structural gene. The polygalacturonase-encoding pehA gene was cloned in Escherichia coli by using the plasmid pBluescript as a vector. Activity-stained isoelectric focusing gel analysis demonstrated that E. coli cells harboring the pehA+ recombinant plasmid pCPP2067 produced a polygalacturonase in culture with the same pI as the enzyme produced by CG49. The peha gene was localized within a 2.5-kb HindIII-salI fragment. This fragment was used as a probe in Southern hybridization analysis and showed that no closely related genes are present in A. tumefaciens biovars 1 or 2, Rhizobium leguminosarum, or Bradyrhizobium japonicum. The polygalacturonase mutant was unable to induce root decay in grapes (Vitis vinifera cv. Chardonnay) and was substantially less tumorigenic than the wild type in grape stems when low levels of inoculum were used, although both strains were equally tumorigenic in potato disc assays. The results indicate that polygalacturonase is a virulence factor in both the root decay and crown gall incited in grapes by A. tumefaciens biovar 3. 3aVitis vinifera 3apolygalacturonase 3aAgrobacterium radiobacter 3aclones 3agenes 3ahost specificity 3astrains 3avirulence 2aAgrobacterium tumefaciensxenzymologyxgenetics. 2aBlotting, Southern 2aCloning, Molecular 2aDNA Transposable Elementsxgenetics 2aEscherichia colixmetabolism 2aFruitxmicrobiology 2aIsoelectric Point 2aMutagenesis, Insertionalxgenetics 2aMutationxgenetics 2aPolygalacturonasexgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aSolanum tuberosumxmicrobiology 0aAgrobacterium tumefaciens1 aBurr, T.J.1 aCollmer, A.0 tJournal of bacteriology.g1991 Oct., v. 173, no. 20 p.6547-6552x0021-91937nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02160naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002700111040001800138100001900156245007600175300001800251520090100269650001401170650001601184650001901200650001901219650003301238650002401271650004001295650002201335650004001357653002301397653002701420700001201447700001701459700001401476773010301490852000901593856007701602930003301679945001301712946001301725655001201738IND2322334320221119112220.0010801e200010  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232233432DNAL7 a110527492pmid7 a10.1021/jf991198d2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCroguennec, T.10aSimple rapid procedure for preparation of large quantities of ovalbumin  ap. 4883-4889.  aA simple rapid procedure for preparation of large quantities of highly purified homogeneous ovalbumin from egg white by using an anion exchanger is described. It is based on the principle of frontal chromatography. The volume of "mucin-free" egg white loaded onto the column was determined in order to exceed resin capacity. Thus, competition between proteins for resin sites was created. Owing to its high negative charge density, ovalbumin drives other egg white proteins from the column progressively. Two hundred and fifty milliliters of Q-Sepharose FF gel eluted isocratically with 0.5 M NaCl extracted 9.55 g of ovalbumin with a purity rate of 83%. A 6.75 g amount of ovalbumin, with a purity rate of 94%, was recovered with an isocratic elution program using 0.14 M NaCl. Purified ovalbumins were compared by electrophoresis and analytical chromatography with other ovalbumin preparations. 3aovalbumin 3aegg albumen 3achromatography 3aanion exchange 2aChromatography, Ion Exchange 2aEgg Whitexanalysis 2aElectrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel 2aMucinsxchemistry 2aOvalbuminxisolation & purification 0aprotein extraction 0afrontal chromatography1 aNau, F.1 aPezennec, S.1 aBrule, G.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2000 Oct., v. 48, no. 10 p.4883-4889x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf991198d3Available from publisher's Web site  a20010903b20010910c00000000  aINDdGHK  aOther US 7aarticle02258naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002700111040001800138100001600156245008800172300001800260520096300278650001001241650001601251650001001267650002301277650002301300650002301323650002201346650001001368650003301378650004101411650002401452650002401476650001901500700001301519700001301532700001901545773010301564852000901667856007701676930003301753945001301786946001301799655001201812IND2322324420221119112301.0010731e200010  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232232442DNAL7 a110527422pmid7 a10.1021/jf00076832doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDarriet, P.10aIdentification and quantification of geosmin, an earthy odorant contaminating wines  ap. 4835-4838.  aMusty, earthy odors are highly detrimental to the aromatic quality of wines. A characteristic aroma of freshly tilled earth, damp cellar was studied in some red and white wines of different origins. The extraction and purification of the wines marked by this odor have shown after analysis by gas chromatography-olfactometry a unique strong odorous zone having the same odor as the one perceived at tasting. The compound responsible for this odorous zone was identified by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry as geosmin (trans-1,10-dimethyl-trans-9-decalol), which possesses a distinctive earthy odor. Geosmin may be present in wines at levels higher than the racemic geosmin olfactory perception threshold, thus suggesting its contribution to their off-aroma. Moreover, the presence of this compound in juice taken from freshly crushed grapes suggests that microorganisms that develop on the grapes may contribute to the presence of this compound in wines. 3awines 3agrape juice 3aodors 3avolatile compounds 3afood contamination 3agas chromatography 3amass spectrometry 3asmell 2aFood Contaminationxanalysis 2aGas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry 2aNaphtholsxanalysis 2aOdorantsxanalysis. 2aWinexanalysis1 aPons, M.1 aLamy, S.1 aDubourdieu, D.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2000 Oct., v. 48, no. 10 p.4835-4838x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf00076833Available from publisher's Web site  a20010903b20010910c00000000  aINDdGHK  aOther US 7aarticle02100naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002700111040001800138100001700156245007400173300001800247520084100265650001201106650002201118650001401140650001001154650002301164650001201187650004101199650002401240650002501264650001901289653001901308700001601327700001701343700001501360700001401375700001701389773010301406852000901509856007701518930003301595945001301628946001301641655001201654IND2322326820221119112240.0010731e200010  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232232682DNAL7 a110527452pmid7 a10.1021/jf991394k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPiveteau, F.10aAroma of fresh oysters Crassostrea gigas: composition and aroma notes  ap. 4851-4857.  aIn contrast to many foods, very little is known about the aroma of fresh oysters. This study deals with the relationship between extracted volatiles of oysters and their olfactory properties. Nearly 50 volatiles were identified: most of them were principally related to fatty acid oxidation (86%) and particularly to n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid oxidation (66%). Only one volatile arose from amino acid degradation. Panelists detected 42 odors by sniffing. Among them, only 12 odors were definitely attributed to identified volatile. These odors were green/sulfur/crustacean, mushroom/citrus, and marine/cucumber notes and were attributed to dimethyl sulfide, 1-penten-3-one, hexanal, (2,4)-E,E-heptadienal, 1-octen-3-one, 1-octen-3-ol, 6-methyl-5-hepten-3-one, octanal, (E,Z)-2,6-nonadienal, (E)-2-octenal, and decanal, respectively. 3aoysters 3aCrassostrea gigas 3araw foods 3aodors 3avolatile compounds 2aAnimals 2aGas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry 2aOdorantsxanalysis. 2aOstreidaexchemistry 2aVolatilization 0afresh products1 aLe Guen, S.1 aGandemer, G.1 aBaud, J.P.1 aProst, C.1 aDemaimay, M.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2000 Oct., v. 48, no. 10 p.4851-4857x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf991394k3Available from publisher's Web site  a20010903b20010910c00000000  aINDdGHK  aOther US 7aarticle02567naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002700111040001800138100001700156245010500173300001800278520107000296650002501366650002001391650001501411650000901426650001301435650001201448650001101460650001701471650001901488650002101507650003601528650001401564650001501578650002801593650004201621650001401663650001601677653002401693653003701717700001401754700001701768700001601785773010301801852000901904856007701913930003301990945001302023946001302036655001202049IND2322376220221119112455.0010802e200010  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232237622DNAL7 a110527602pmid7 a10.1021/jf000457s2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChampion, D.10aReaction rate modeling in cryoconcentrated solutions: alkaline phosphatase catalyzed DNPP hydrolysis  ap. 4942-4947.  aThe hydrolysis of disodium p-nitrophenyl phosphate catalyzed by alkaline phosphatase was chosen as a model to study the kinetics of changes in frozen food products. The initial reaction rate was determined in concentrated sucrose solutions down to -24 degrees C, and the enzymatic characteristics K(m) and V(max) were calculated. The experimental data were compared to the kinetics predicted by assuming that the reaction was viscosity dependent. Indeed, an analysis of the enzymatic reaction demonstrated that both the diffusion of the substrate and the flexibility of the enzyme segments were controlled by the high viscosity of the media. When the temperature was too low for the viscosity to be measured simply, the Williams-Landel-Ferry equation was used to predict the viscosity, taking, as reference temperature, the glass transition temperature (T(g)) corresponding to the concentration of the freeze-concentrated phase at the test temperature. Predicted values of the reaction rate were very close to the experimental ones in the studied temperature range. 3aalkaline phosphatase 3aenzyme activity 3ahydrolysis 3acold 3afreezing 3asucrose 3amodels 3afrozen foods 3afrozen storage 3afreezing quality 2aAlkaline Phosphatasexchemistry 2aCatalysis 2aHydrolysis 2aNitrophenolsxchemistry 2aOrganophosphorus Compoundsxchemistry 2aSolutions 2aTemperature 0aphosphates (esters) 0adisodium p-nitrophenyl phosphate1 aBlond, G.1 aLe Meste, M.1 aSimatos, D.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2000 Oct., v. 48, no. 10 p.4942-4947x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf000457s3Available from publisher's Web site  a20010903b20010910c00000000  aINDdGHK  aOther US 7aarticle02328naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100002400128245012500152300001600277520097700293650001401270650001601284650002501300650001801325650000801343650001001351650001201361650002301373650002201396650005001418650002501468650002401493650002001517650002901537650001801566650006601584650001201650650002701662653001601689700001701705700001401722773006701736852000901803939003301812946001301845655001201858IND9202116620221119112438.0920413e199111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920211662DNAL7 a19267912pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKuyl, A.C. van der.10aRole of alfalfa mosaic virus coat protein in regulation of the balance between viral plus and minus strand RNA synthesis  ap. 496-499.  aReplication of wild type RNA 3 of alfalfa mosaic virus (AlMV) and mutants with frameshifts in the P3 or coat protein (CP) genes was studied in protoplasts from tobacco plants transformed with DNA copies of AlMV RNAs 1 and 2. Accumulation of viral plus and minus strand RNAs was monitored with strand-specific probes. A frameshift in the P3 gene did not change the asymmetry in plus/minus strand accumulation observed for the wild type. A frameshift early in the CP gene resulted in a 100-fold reduction in plus strand accumulation and a 3- to 10-fold increase in minus strand accumulation. A frameshift late in the CP gene caused a similar reduction in plus strand accumulation but had no effect on minus strand accumulation. This latter mutant accumulated nearly wild type levels of a truncated CP molecule. Apparently, wild type AlMV CP up-regulates plus strand accumulation and down-regulates minus strand accumulation and these two functions can be mutated separately. 3aNicotiana 3aprotoplasts 3aAlfalfa mosaic virus 3acoat proteins 3aRNA 3agenes 3amutants 2aBlotting, Northern 2aBlotting, Western 2aCapsidxisolation & purificationxmetabolism. 2aDNA, Viralxgenetics 2aFrameshift Mutation 2aMedicago sativa 2aMosaic Virusesxgenetics 2aPlants, Toxic 2aRNA, Viralxbiosynthesisxgeneticsxisolation & purification. 2aTobacco 2aTranscription, Genetic 0areplication1 aNeeleman, L.1 aBol, J.F.0 tVirology.g1991 Nov., v. 185, no. 1 p.496-499x0042-68227nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02179naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002700111040001800138100001400156245007500170300001800245520089700263650000901160650002001169650002701189650001501216650001701231650001601248650001201264650002201276650004001298650002601338650002301364650002501387650002501412700001701437700001801454700001301472773010301485852000901588856007701597930003301674945001301707946001301720655001201733IND2322375520221119112704.0010802e200010  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232237552DNAL7 a110527532pmid7 a10.1021/jf990479i2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKonno, K.10aEarly structural changes in myosin rod upon heating of carp myofibrils  ap. 4905-4909.  aUpon heating carp myofibrils at 40 degrees C, the amount of myosin that is soluble and monomeric dropped very quickly, roughly 5 times faster than the ATPase inactivation. This rapid decrease of solubility was well explained by a rapid denaturation of the rod portion as measured by chymotryptic digestibility. Chymotryptic digestion of heated myofibrils in a low-salt medium with EDTA generated a reduced amount of rod and subfragment-1 (S-1). The decrease of S-1 produced from the heated myofibrils was consistent with the ATPase inactivation. The decrease of rod produced from the heated myofibrils was explained by the increased susceptibility of the heavy meromyosin (HMM)/light meromyosin (LMM) junction to chymotryptic. It was, therefore, concluded that the fastest event occurring in the myosin molecule upon heating of myofibrils is the irreversible exposure of the HMM/LMM junction. 3acarp 3askeletal muscle 3amolecular conformation 3asolubility 3adenaturation 3aproteolysis 2aAnimals 2aCarpsxmetabolism 2aElectrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel 2aMyofibrilsxchemistry 2aMyosinsxchemistry 2aProtein Conformation 2aProtein Denaturation1 aYamamoto, T.1 aTakahashi, M.1 aKato, S.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2000 Oct., v. 48, no. 10 p.4905-4909x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf990479i3Available from publisher's Web site  a20010903b20010910c00000000  aINDdGHK  aOther US 7aarticle02749naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002700111040001800138100002200156245013400178300001800312500001500330520128200345650001001627650001701637650004301654650002001697650001901717650001501736650001301751650006801764650002901832650002601861650001801887650002201905650003101927650002101958653001401979653001901993700001902012773010302031852000902134856007702143930003302220945001302253946001302266655001202279IND2322447220221119112217.0010809e200011  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232244722DNAL7 a110874572pmid7 a10.1021/jf00030002doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSzmigielska, A.M.10aUse of anion-exchange membrane extraction for the high-performance liquid chromatographic analysis of mustard seed glucosinolates  ap. 5190-5194.  a2019-12-04  aA new one-step extraction using anion-exchange membranes for the HPLC determination of glucosinolates in mustard seeds is reported. The exchange of glucosinolates on the membranes was studied using sinigrin in solutions and sinigrin added as an internal standard to seeds of yellow mustard. By varying time of extraction, membrane size, and sample size, the optimal conditions for maximum glucosinolate recovery were determined and the following procedure was adopted: 0.2 g of ground mustard seeds are heated in 20 mL of boiling water for 5 min. After cooling, samples are transferred to plastic centrifuge tubes, 9-cm2 membranes are added, and suspensions are shaken on a mechanical shaker for 2.5 h. Glucosinolates are then eluted from the membranes with 25 mL of 1 N KCl by shaking again for 2.5 h. Using this procedure, the sinigrin extraction from solutions and from mustard seeds was linear with 80% recovery. Seeds of yellow, brown, oriental, and Indian mustard were analyzed by this procedure; excellent reproducibility, with coefficients of variation in the range 1.0-4.3% were obtained. This method offers a simple and inexpensive alternative to complicated and tedious procedures for glucosinolate isolation/purification required for chromatographic determinations. 3aseeds 3aSinapis alba 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3aBrassica juncea 3aanion exchange 3aextraction 3asinigrin 2aChromatography, High Pressure Liquidxinstrumentationxmethods. 2aGlucosinolatesxanalysis 2aMembranes, Artificial 2aMustard Plant 2aPlants, Medicinal 2aReproducibility of Results 2aSeedsxchemistry 0amembranes 0aglucosinolates1 aSchoenau, J.J.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2000 Nov., v. 48, no. 11 p.5190-5194x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf00030003Available from publisher's Web site  a20010929b20011005c00000000  aINDdGHK  aOther US 7aarticle02857naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002700111040001800138100002600156245015200182300001800334520120200352650002101554650002301575650002601598650001601624650002601640650001501666650001401681650002301695650001601718650002501734650004701759650002001806650002601826650001801852650001801870650002001888650005401908650002201962650001301984653002501997653002602022700001402048700001702062773010302079852000902182856007702191930003302268945001302301946001302314655001202327IND2322446720221119112236.0010809e200011  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232244672DNAL7 a110874542pmid7 a10.1021/jf000604m2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRodriguez-Saona, L.E.10aUse of Fourier transform near-infrared reflectance spectroscopy for rapid quantification of castor bean meal in a selection of flour-based products  ap. 5169-5177.  aMethodology was developed and evaluated for the rapid detection of castor bean meal (CBM) containing the toxic protein ricin by using Fourier transform near-infrared (FT-NIR) spectroscopy and multivariate techniques. The method is intended to be a prototype to develop a more general approach to detect food tampering. Measurements were made on an FT-NIR system using a diffuse reflection-integrating sphere. Flours spiked with caffeine, crystalline sugar, and corn meal, 1-20% w/w, were used as test articles to evaluate the methodologies. Food matrices (bleached flour, wheat flour, and blueberry pancake mix) spiked with CBM (0.5-8% w/w) were analyzed. Multiplicative scatter correction transformed partial least-squares regression models, using a specific NIR spectral region, predicted CBM contamination in foods with a standard error of cross-validation of <0.6% and a coefficient of determination (R2) of >94%. Models discriminated between flour samples contaminated with CBM and other protein sources (egg white, soybean meal, tofu, and infant formula). CBM had loading spectra with bands characteristic of amide groups (4880 and 4555 cm(-1) and lipids (5800, 5685, 4340, and 4261 cm(-1)). 3acastor bean meal 3afood contamination 3ainfrared spectroscopy 3awheat flour 3amultivariate analysis 3acane sugar 3acorn meal 2aCaffeinexanalysis 2aCastor Bean 2aColorimetryxmethods 2aEnzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assayxmethods 2aFlourxanalysis 2aMultivariate Analysis 2aPlant Lectins 2aPlants, Toxic 2aRicinxanalysis 2aSpectroscopy, Fourier Transform Infraredxmethods 2aSucrosexanalysis 2aZea mays 0ableached wheat flour 0ablueberry pancake mix1 aFry, F.S.1 aCalvey, E.M.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2000 Nov., v. 48, no. 11 p.5169-5177x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf000604m3Available from publisher's Web site  a20010929b20011005c00000000  aINDdGHK  aOther US 7aarticle02585naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002700111040001800138100001700156245008500173300001800258520122700276650001001503650001401513650001801527650001501545650002301560650001501583650002101598650003301619650002401652650002801676650002901704650003301733650002101766650001501787653001401802700001601816700001601832700001901848773010301867852000901970856007701979930003302056945001302089946001302102655001202115IND2322447920221119111927.0010809e200011  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232244792DNAL7 a110874602pmid7 a10.1021/jf000467t2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTaylor, W.G.10aMicrodetermination of diosgenin from fenugreek (Trigonella foenum-graecum) seeds  ap. 5206-5210.  aSulfuric acid hydrolysis of steroidal glycosides of Amber fenugreek was studied by capillary gas chromatographic analysis of diosgenin [(25R)-spirost-5-en-3-ol] and isomeric spirostadiene artifacts from 100 mg samples of seed material. Following extraction with 80% ethanol, highest recoveries of diosgenin occurred when hydrolyses were conducted in sulfuric acid, prepared at 1 molar (M) concentration in water containing 60-80% 2-propanol. Compared to a previous method with aqueous hydrochloric acid, the selected conditions of hydrolysis at 100 degrees C for 2 h with sulfuric acid in 70% 2-propanol reduced diene formation but did not completely eliminate these artifacts. Extraction of steroidal saponins with various alcohol/water mixtures prior to sulfuric acid hydrolysis gave similar recoveries of diosgenin. Application of the quantitative method to experimental samples of Amber, Quatro, and ZT-5 fenugreek, using 10 mg subsamples of crushed seed that had been defatted with petroleum ether and dried at 60 degrees C, gave diosgenin levels of 0.55, 0.42, and 0.75%, respectively.

HSCCC also enabled the isolation of a polymeric fraction from black tea. According to Roberts' classification, the polymeric fraction mainly consisted of SII thearubigins (TR).

The enzyme was effectively extracted and partially purified from the pith using combinations of nonionic detergents. With Triton X-114 and a temperature-induced phase partitioning method, the enzyme showed a recovery of 70% and purification of 4.1-fold. Native PAGE analysis of the partially purified LPPO revealed three activity bands when stained with catechol and two bands with pyrogallol. The molecular masses of the enzymes were estimated by SDS-PAGE to be 37, 45, and 53 kDa. The enzyme showed optimum pH values of 4.5 with 4-methylcatechol as a substrate and 7.5 with pyrogallol. The LPPO was highly reactive toward diphenols and triphenols. The activity of the enzyme was greatly enhanced in the presence of trypsin, SDS, ethanol, and linoleic acid. 3aMetroxylon sagu 3acatechol oxidase 3aenzyme activity 3afood processing 2aCatechol Oxidasexchemistryxmetabolism. 2aElectrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel 2aEnzyme Activation 2aPlantsxchemistry 2aSubstrate Specificity1 aSaari, N. bin.1 aSelamat, J.1 aBakar, J.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2000 Oct., v. 48, no. 10 p.5041-5045x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf99094543Available from publisher's Web site  a20010903b20010910c00000000  aINDdGHK  aOther US 7aarticle01427naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245007600127300001600203520057900219650001300798650000900811650001900820650001500839650001600854650001700870650001500887650002000902653000900922700001800931773009900949852000901048939003301057946001101090655001201101IND9202110820221119112034.0920413s1991    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920211082DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSrikar, L.N.10aProtein solubility and emulsifying capacity in frozen stored fish mince  ap. 447-453.  aEffect of initial freshness on the relationship between emulsifying capacity and protein solubility of frozen stored fish mince was investigated.

In this study, we show that mutation of rbdA, which encodes a fusion protein consisting of PAS-PAC-GGDEF-EAL multidomains, results in decreased biofilm dispersal. RbdA contains a highly conserved GGDEF domain and EAL domain, which are involved in the synthesis and degradation of c-di-GMP, respectively. However, in vivo and in vitro analyses show that the full-length RbdA protein only displays phosphodiesterase activity, causing c-di-GMP degradation. Further analysis reveals that the GGDEF domain of RbdA plays a role in activating the phosphodiesterase activity of the EAL domain in the presence of GTP. Moreover, we show that deletion of the PAS domain or substitution of the key residues implicated in sensing low-oxygen stress abrogates the functionality of RbdA. Subsequent study showed that RbdA is involved in positive regulation of bacterial motility and production of rhamnolipids, which are associated with biofilm dispersal, and in negative regulation of production of exopolysaccharides, which are required for biofilm formation. These data indicate that the c-di-GMP-degrading regulatory protein RbdA promotes biofilm dispersal through its two-pronged effects on biofilm development, i.e., downregulating biofilm formation and upregulating production of the factors associated with biofilm dispersal.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aPseudomonas aeruginosa 3abacterial motility 3abiofilm 3aenzymes 3aexopolysaccharides 3aguanosine triphosphate 3amutation 3aregulatory proteins 3asecond messengers1 aWu, Ji'en1 aZhang, Lian-Hui0 tApplied and environmental microbiology.g2010 Dec. 15, v. 76, no. 24 p.8160-8173dAmerican Society for Microbiologyx0099-22407nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1128/AEM.01233-103Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle01912naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001800128245010800146300001600254500001500270520058700285650002500872650001400897650000900911650001900920650002500939650001500964650001200979650002800991650003301019650001401052650000901066650002401075650001101099650001101110650002901121650000901150650003001159650002201189653001701211700001701228700001701245700001701262773008601279852000901365939003301374946001101407655001201418IND9202108520221119111932.0920415e199103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920210852DNAL7 a20567602pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPantoja, C.V.10aDiuretic, natriuretic and hypotensive effects produced by Allium sativum (garlic) in anaesthetized dogs  ap. 325-331.  a2019-12-04  aGastric administration of encapsuled garlic powder to anaesthetized dogs induced dose-dependent (2.5 to 15 mg/kg) natriuretic and diuretic responses which reached maximum 30-40 min after garlic administration and decreased to basal levels after 100-150 min.

Gossypol was linked to LPH (Limulus polyphemus hemolymph), BSA (bovine serum albumin), amines, or amino acids via Schiff base intermediates for the production of immunogen, solid-phase, and gossypol derivatives. Products were stabilized using NaBH3CN. Polyclonal antibodies were produced from rabbits after four immunizations with gossypol-LPH. In ELISA, approximately 0.4 micromolar caused 50% inhibition of binding (I50) to gossypol-BSA solid-phase, when gossypol derivatives were used competitively. This antibody showed higher affinity to lysine-derivatized gossypol, hemigossypol, gossypolone, 6,6'-dimethoxygossypol, and hexamethoxygossypol compared to underivatized counterparts, and this antibody did not recognize naphthalene or naphthol.

The mRNA encoding r-protein L3 is derived from a single-copy gene, and experimental evidence would suggest that it contains the pan-nematode splice leader sequence at its 5' end and that the gene is interrupted by at least three introns. 3aproteins 3amessenger RNA 3astructural genes 3acomplementary DNA 3aribosomes 3aamino acid sequences 3agene expression 3aexons 3aToxocara canis 3aintrons 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAnimals 2aBase Sequence 2aCloning, Molecular 2aDNA, Complementaryxgenetics 2aDNA, Helminthxgenetics 2aGene Dosage 2aGenes, Helminthxgenetics 2aHelminth Proteinsxgenetics 2aIntronsxgenetics 2aLarva 2aMale 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aRNA, Messengerxgenetics 2aRibosomal Proteinsxgenetics 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 2aSequence Homology, Amino Acid 2aToxocara canisxgenetics 0asplice leader sequence 0atl3 gene 0auntranslated region 0amolecular sequence data 0agenbank/u17358 0anucleotide sequences1 aTodorova, V.1 aKennedy, M.W.0 tGene.g1995, v. 165, no. 2 p.239-242x0378-11197nnas  aDNAL  a19960304b19960308c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle03217naa a2200673 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001800128245013500146300001600281500001500297520126700312650002501579650001401604650001801618650002201636650002301658650001001681650003301691650003101724650002601755650001801781650003201799650004501831650003201876650002201908650003301930650002001963650001701983650001002000650001702010650002802027650003102055650002602086650001702112650002702129650003602156653001202192653002302204653001602227653000802243653001902251653002802270653002002298653003102318700001302349700001302362700001402375700001802389773005802407852000902465930003302474945001302507946001102520655001202531IND2049836720221119111921.0960212s1995    ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204983672DNAL7 a85221702pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHayashida, N.10aConstruction of a cDNA library for a specific region of a chromosome using a novel cDNA selection method utilizing latex particles  ap. 155-161.  a2019-12-05  aA novel method is described for the rapid concentration of particular cDNAs and their mapping to specific regions of a genome. The strategy for 'cDNA scanning' is based on the hybridization of an entire library of cDNAs to a large fragment of genomic DNA that is covalently bound to latex particles. The hybridized cDNAs are eluted, amplified by PCR and cloned into a lambda vector. Selected cDNAs that hybridized to the genomic DNA are cloned, with subsequent sequence analysis. Region-specific DNA fragments prepared from a yeast artificial chromosome (YAC) clone, EG10D9, which maps to chromosome 5 of the small cruciferous plant Arabidopsis thaliana (At), were used to prepare a model system and were covalently bound to latex particles. cDNAs that hybridized to EG10D9 were concentrated by hybridization to the immobilized DNA. The hybridized cDNAs were recovered and amplified by PCR. The resultant sub-library of cDNAs of 0.5-2 kb in length was enriched about 1000-fold. The partial sequences of the cDNAs provided information about genes that are located on the EG10D9 region of the At genome. The cDNA scanning strategy provides an efficient method for the mapping of expressed genes which could be used as expressed sequence tags (EST) within a genome. 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aparticles 3aDNA libraries 3acomplementary DNA 3achromosome mapping 3alatex 3ayeast artificial chromosomes 3anucleic acid hybridization 2aArabidopsisxgenetics 2aBase Sequence 2aChromosome Mappingxmethods 2aChromosomes, Artificial, Yeastxgenetics 2aCloning, Molecularxmethods 2aCosmidsxgenetics 2aDNA, Complementaryxgenetics 2aGene Expression 2aGene Library 2aLatex 2aMicrospheres 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aNucleic Acid Hybridization 2aPolymethacrylic Acids 2aPolystyrenes 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 2aSequence Homology, Nucleic Acid 0acloning 0apositional cloning 0achromosomes 0aDNA 0aimmobilization 0ahybridization selection 0aimmobilized dna 0acomplementary dna scanning1 aSumi, Y.1 aWada, T.1 aHanda, H.1 aShinozaki, K.0 tGene.g1995, v. 165, no. 2 p.155-161x0378-11197nnas  aDNAL  a19960304b19960308c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle03890naa a2200781 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002700111040001800138072000900156072000900165072000900174072000900183072000900192100001700201245015200218300001800370500002400388500001500412520150100427650001301928650002201941650002001963650001701983650002102000650001902021650002002040650002002060650002002080650001502100650001302115650001302128650001902141650001502160650002702175650002602202650001702228650004302245650003102288650004002319650005402359650002002413650001302433650003602446650003602482650001902518650005202537650002102589653001002610653002702620653001002647700001602657700001902673700001802692700001802710700001602728700001602744700001602760773016302776852000902939856007702948930003303025945002503058946001303083655001203096IND4408307920221119111931.0080728e20080723xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440830792DNAL7 a185648482pmid7 a10.1021/jf80033382doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF110 0aF600 0aF200 0aF300 0aQ5051 aGiuntini, D.10aFlavonoid Profiling and Biosynthetic Gene Expression in Flesh and Peel of Two Tomato Genotypes Grown under UV-B-Depleted Conditions during Ripening  ap. 5905-5915.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe effect of shielding solar ultraviolet B radiation on the accumulation of some flavonoids and their precursor hydroxycinnamic acids in tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) was evaluated by liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-MS/MS). In particular, flesh and peel of two tomato hybrids, DRW 5981 and Esperanza, were separately analyzed. The hybrids have been chosen for their different responses to the light, since it was previously reported that they show different pigmentation and opposite behavior under UV-B in terms of carotenoids and ascorbic acid content at different ripening stages. To determine the effect of UV-B radiation during tomato ripening, we also measured the expression of some flavonoid biosynthetic genes by real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis. The results allowed us to conclude that UV-B radiation deeply and differentially affects the content of the considered flavonoids and hydroxycinnamic acids as well as the expression of some of their biosynthetic genes in both flesh and peel during the ripening process. On the other hand, the collected data clearly showed that this influence varies between different genotypes. We conclude that the use of specific plastic covers able to eliminate UV-B radiation may be an environmentally friendly approach to modulate the expression of structural genes and, in turn, to enhance healthy antioxidant compounds in fruits of specific tomato cultivars. 3atomatoes 3aplant development 3asolar radiation 3abiosynthesis 3astructural genes 3acoumaric acids 3anutrient uptake 3alight intensity 3agene expression 3afruit pulp 3agenotype 3aripening 3aplant response 3aflavonoids 3abiochemical mechanisms 3aultraviolet radiation 3aantioxidants 3aSolanum lycopersicum var. lycopersicum 2aAcyltransferasesxgenetics 2aFlavonoidsxanalysisxbiosynthesis. 2aFruitxchemistryxgeneticsxgrowth & development. 2aGene Expression 2aGenotype 2aIntramolecular Lyasesxgenetics 2aSolanum lycopersicumxgenetics. 2aRNA, Messenger 2aReverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction 2aUltraviolet Rays 0apeels 0afruits (plant anatomy) 0alight1 aLazzeri, V.1 aCalvenzani, V.1 aDall'Asta, C.1 aGalaverna, G.1 aTonelli, C.1 aPetroni, K.1 aRanieri, A.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2008 July 23, v. 56, no. 14 p.5905-5915dAmerican Chemical Society, Books and Journals Division]x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf80033383Available from publisher's Web site  a20090610b20090703c00000000  aINDd4CTe2009/05/09  aOther US 7aarticle02779naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001500144245009300159300001600252520143700268592002801705650002501733650002401758650001801782650002001800650002801820650001301848650001301861650003301874650001301907650002301920650003001943650002801973650001202001650001102013650001402024650001002038650001102048650001002059651001102069700001902080700001902099700001802118773010702136856004502243852000902288655001202297IND50064476220221120055820.0130401e201212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006447622DNAL7 a10.1002/jobm.2011005642doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSevim, Ali10aBacteria from Ips sexdentatus (Coleoptera: Curculionidae) and their biocontrol potential  ap. 695-704.  aIps sexdentatus (Coleoptera: Curculionidae) is one of the most destructive pests of the spruce trees in Europe. In this study, we have isolated and characterized culturable bacteria from I. sexdentatus and tested their insecticidal activity against the last instar larvae of the pest as a possible biocontrol agent. A total of eight bacterial isolates was determined and four of them were identified at species level, and the others were identified at genus level. Isolates were identified as Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (Is1), Rahnella sp. (Is2), Pseudomonas sp. (Is3), Bacillus sp. (Is4), Alcaligenes faecalis (Is5), Panteoea agglomerans (Is6), Pseudomonas fluorescens (Is7) and Serratia sp. (Is8) based on their morphological, biochemical and molecular characteristics. Insecticidal effects of bacterial isolates were performed on the last instar larvae of the pest. The highest insecticidal activity was obtained from P. fluorescens (Is7) with 73% mortality within 10 days after inoculation (p < 0.05). Mortality values of the other isolates ranged from 20 to 53%. This study suggests that Pseudomonas fluorescens (Is7) seems to be a good candidate as a possible biocontrol agent against I. sexdentatus, and provides suitable strains that can be modified to express insecticidal toxins and/or other detrimental substances to develop new control methods for I. sexdentatus.

Based on more than 400 cases in cold regions, this study compared the post-evaluation and drivers of ZEBs from China, the US and the European Union (EU). Results found that ZEB definition, energy drivers, standard, regional policies, technology adoption and their adoption ratio determine the energy performance of cases. Not all EU and China cases reach the net-zero energy target; however, most ZEBs in the US do. ZEBs in cold regions adopted multiple technologies to achieve high energy-efficiency. The adoption ratio of passive technologies is higher than that of active technologies, especially in China. The active technologies in cold regions are mainly seen in the application of advanced HVAC systems. Such application of renewable technologies exhibits strong regional characteristics; for example, the EU’s carbon emission reduction policies promoted the use of biomass-based technologies. The analysis also found that energy policies greatly enhance the development of ZEBs. Overall, achieving zero energy is a process, not an endpoint and many projects need further refinement after occupancy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEuropean Union 3acarbon 3acold 3aenergy efficiency 3ainnovation adoption 3aChina 0aZero energy building 0aCold climates 0aRenewable energy 0aEnergy policy 0aStandard 0aCase study1 aFeng, Wei1 aWang, Lan1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7241-290X1 aLu, Shilei0 tEnergy.g2021 Jan. 15, v. 215 p.118992-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2020.1189923Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02720naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094024002200134024001900156040001800175100002200193245010200215300001600317506007600333520131700409592002801726506003701754650002201791650001201813650002101825650002001846650002301866650002001889650001301909650001801922650000801940650001901948650002401967650001201991650001802003700001702021700002302038700002202061773008402083856008602167852000902253655001202262IND60096292820221207095247.0141104e201212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009629282DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cryobiol.2012.05.0102doi7 aPMC35004042pmcid7 a227280462pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHopkins, Jesse B.10aEffect of common cryoprotectants on critical warming rates and ice formation in aqueous solutions  ap. 169-178.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aIce formation on warming is of comparable or greater importance to ice formation on cooling in determining survival of cryopreserved samples. Critical warming rates required for ice-free warming of vitrified aqueous solutions of glycerol, dimethyl sulfoxide, ethylene glycol, polyethylene glycol 200 and sucrose have been measured for warming rates of order 10–10⁴K/s. Critical warming rates are typically one to three orders of magnitude larger than critical cooling rates. Warming rates vary strongly with cooling rates, perhaps due to the presence of small ice fractions in nominally vitrified samples. Critical warming and cooling rate data spanning orders of magnitude in rates provide rigorous tests of ice nucleation and growth models and their assumed input parameters. Current models with current best estimates for input parameters provide a reasonable account of critical warming rates for glycerol solutions at high concentrations/low rates, but overestimate both critical warming and cooling rates by orders of magnitude at lower concentrations and larger rates. In vitrification protocols, minimizing concentrations of potentially damaging cryoprotectants while minimizing ice formation will require ultrafast warming rates, as well as fast cooling rates to minimize the required warming rates.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aaqueous solutions 3acooling 3acryopreservation 3acryoprotectants 3adimethyl sulfoxide 3aethylene glycol 3aglycerol 3agrowth models 3aice 3aice nucleation 3apolyethylene glycol 3asucrose 3avitrification1 aBadeau, Ryan1 aWarkentin, Matthew1 aThorne, Robert E.0 tCryobiology.g2012 Dec., v. 65, no. 3 p.169-178dElsevier Inc.x0011-22407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cryobiol.2012.05.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02957naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001400151245017500165300001800340520122500358592002801583650001501611650001701626650001401643650002301657650002101680650001401701650001201715650001201727650001901739650001601758650001601774650001801790650001401808650001401822650003001836650001701866653002601883653002701909653003001936653002401966653003101990700001602021700001502037700001602052700001502068700001202083700001702095700005402112773014302166856008502309852000902394655001202403IND60630016420221119232008.0190204e20190114xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063001642DNAL7 a10.1021/acssuschemeng.8b060902doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHe, Yuchu10aRationally Designed Multifunctional Carbon–Palladium Nanohybrids for Wide Applications: From Electrochemical Catalysis/Nonenzymatic Sensor to Photothermal Tumor Therapy  ap. 3584-3592.  aPalladium nanomaterials have been widely investigated in many areas due to their high activity of catalysis and surface plasmon resonance (SPR) resulting from their special configurations of the outer electrons. Herein, the novel nanoparticles, reduced graphene oxide modified with palladium nanoflowers (rGO/PdNFs), were designed and synthesized by seeded growth. Their application potentials in three areas were explored, including electrochemical ethanol catalysis, nonenzymatic glucose sensor, and photothermal tumor therapy. The hybrids of PdNFs and rGO increased the conductivity and active sites of PdNFs and then enhanced the activity of catalysis. Interestingly, through control of morphologies, the absorption of PdNFs in the near-infrared region was enhanced compared with common palladium nanoparticles, which showed excellent potential in photothermal tumor therapy. These results indicated the stronger activity of catalysis to ethanol of rGO/PdNFs compared with the commercial Pd/C catalyst, superior sensitivity and selectivity of glucose, and effective photothermal antitumor efficacy. Overall, it is demonstrated that the multifunctional rGO/PdNFs nanohybrids could possess more application potentials.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3aactive sites 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrons 3aethanol 3aglucose 3agraphene oxide 3ananoflowers 3ananohybrids 3ananoparticles 3aneoplasms 3apalladium 3asurface plasmon resonance 3atherapeutics 0aPalladium nanoflowers 0aReduced graphene oxide 0aElectrochemical catalysis 0aNonenzymatic sensor 0aPhotothermal tumor therapy1 aCao, Weiwei1 aCong, Cong1 aZhang, Xuwu1 aLuo, Liyao1 aLi, Lei1 aCui, Hongxia1 aGao, Dawei1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5030-70220 tACS sustainable chemistry & engineering.g2019 Jan. 14, v. 7, no. 3 p.3584-3592dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23317x2168-04857nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acssuschemeng.8b060903Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02522naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001100140245012200151300001800273500002000291520124600311592002801557650001101585650002301596650001801619650001501637650001901652650001901671650001301690650001101703650000701714650002101721650001901742650001401761650002201775650003701797650000901834700001401843773016001857856007402017852000902091655001202100IND60590849620221122061608.0180314e20060301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059084962DNAL7 a10.1002/pola.212872doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBo, Qi10aDouble‐hydrophilic block copolymer for encapsulation and two‐way pH change‐induced release of metalloporphyrins  ap. 1734-1744.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aA double hydrophilic block copolymer composed of poly(acrylic acid) (PAA) and poly(4‐vinyl pyridine) (P4VP) was obtained through hydrolysis of diblock copolymer of poly(tert‐butyl acrylate) (PtBA) and P4VP synthesized using atom transfer radical polymerization. Water‐soluble micelles with PAA core and P4VP corona were observed at low (acidic) pH, while micelles with P4VP core and PAA corona were formed at high (basic) pH. Two metalloporphyrins, zinc tetraphenylporphyrin (ZnTPP) and cobalt tetraphenylporphyrin (CoTPP), were used as model compounds to investigate the encapsulation of hydrophobic molecules by both types of micelles. UV–vis spectroscopic measurements indicate that micelles with P4VP core are able to entrap more ZnTPP and CoTPP as a result of the axial coordination between the transition metals and the pyridine groups. The study found that metalloporphyrins encapsulated by the micelles with PAA core could be released on pH increase, while those entrapped by the micelles with P4VP core could be released on pH decrease. This behavior originates from the two‐way pH change‐induced disruption of PAA‐b‐P4VP micelles. © 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Interaction with the protein scaffold and flowing blood modulates the ability of endothelial cells to migrate, align and maintain barrier function. Interaction with neighbors provides the endothelial monolayer unique “collective” properties. However, the nature of local mechanical signaling – i.e., the local functional consequence of a cell interacting with its contractile neighbors – remains unclear. Using an advancing sheet of pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells, here we examine the mechanical properties of an individual cell and its neighboring region. By combining Monolayer Stress Microscopy (MSM) with a novel analysis, we assessed several mechanical properties of an individual cell and its neighboring region. Across the monolayer, mechanical properties of the neighboring region defined multicellular “subdivisions” wherein constituent cells were exposed to a similar mechanical microenvironment. Adjacent subdivisions were separated by a narrow interface where adjoining cells were exposed to remarkably different mechanical microenvironments. Comparison of temporal fluctuations in mechanical properties of individual cells and those of their neighboring regions suggested three distinct intercellular mechanical signaling processes. These processes indicated that change in size, shape and speed of individual cells is associated with change in contractile forces in their neighboring regions. In summary, we present a novel approach to assess the mechanical interactions of individual cells with their contractile neighbors and identify potential functional consequences of such interactions.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3ablood 3aendothelial cells 3amicroscopy 3aresearch 3ascaffolding proteins 0aMorphology 0aMotion 0aForces 0aMechanics 0aTissue engineering 0aMechanical signaling1 aXu, Ningyong1 aNguyen, Alyson1 aAlvarez, Diego F.1 aFredberg, Jeffrey J.1 aStevens, Troy1 aTambe, Dhananjay T.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6534-65770 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2019 Nov. 05, v. 519, no. 2 p.337-343dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl46848x0006-291X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2019.08.1693Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01843naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245006600158300001800224500002000242520090400262592002801166650001501194650002601209650001701235650001001252650002201262650001401284773016001298856007401458852000901532655001201541IND60590849720221122061414.0180314e20060301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059084972DNAL7 a10.1002/pola.212582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShabat, Doron10aSelf‐immolative dendrimers as novel drug delivery platforms  ap. 1569-1578.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aSelf‐immolative dendrimers were recently developed and introduced as a potential platform for a single‐triggered multi‐prodrug. These unique structural dendrimers can release all of their tail units through domino‐like chain fragmentation, which is initiated by a single cleavage at the dendrimer core. The incorporation of drug molecules as the tail units and an enzyme substrate as the trigger generates a multi‐prodrug unit that is activated with a single enzymatic cleavage. We have demonstrated several examples of self‐immolative dendritic prodrug systems and have shown significant advantages with respect to the appropriate monomeric prodrug. We anticipate that single‐triggered, dendritic prodrugs will be exploited to further improve selective chemotherapeutic approaches in cancer therapy. © 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

In the second part, we were interested in testing the effect of quercetin, as an antioxidant, in preventing sperm damage during the freeze–thawing process. Seventeen semen samples were obtained from 17 men recruited for infertility investigations. Liquefied sperm was cryopreserved using spermfreeze®. Nine of the used samples were divided into two aliquots; the first one was cryopreserved with spermfreeze only (control) and the second one was cryopreserved with spermfreeze supplemented with quercetin to a final concentration of 50μM. Sperm motility and viability were assessed according to WHO criteria. We used TUNEL assay and the Oxy DNA assay to assess sperm DNA integrity. Activated caspase 3 levels were measured in spermatozoa using fluorescein-labeled inhibitor of caspase (FLICA). Cryopreservation led to a significant increase in sperm DNA fragmentation, DNA oxidation and caspase 3 activation (p<0.01). Supplementation of the cryopreservation medium with quercetrin induced a significant improvement in post thaw sperm parameters, compared to those of control, regarding sperm motility (p=0.007), viability (p=0.008) and DNA integrity (p=0.02); however, it had no effect on caspase 3 activation (p=0.3). We conclude that oxidative stress plays a major role in inducing sperm cryodamage but implication of apoptosis in this impairment requires further investigations.

In Brazil, several aquaculture and salt ponds have been established over mangroves and salt flats (‘apicuns’) i.e. sandier natural areas contiguous to mangroves. These areas, often hypersaline, can be colonized by mangroves if tidal coverage increases, and should, therefore, be protected to ensure mangrove conservation against predicted sea level rise. To restore a mangrove stand in an abandoned saltworks (former ‘apicum’ area) in northeast Brazil, hydrological restoration measures were applied, which involved digging channels to restore estuarine water flux to planted and water-borne propagules. In two years, mangroves developed rapidly in the intervention area, after decades of slow monospecific Avicennia germinans recovery. Survival of planted Rhizophora mangle propagules was high, and naturally established Avicennia germinans and Laguncularia racemosa reached far higher densities and heights in channels with respect to the condition before channeling. These results provide valuated insight into mangrove expansion over salt flats by increasing tidal coverage from ongoing rising sea levels. Associated with ecological changes after mangrove rehabilitation and driven by the return of plant and faunal key groups, ecological interactions like facilitation, herbivory and bioturbation increased in the restored area. Our results shed light on the processes related to forest recovery of degraded littoral areas, and contribute to improving the restoration and management of mangrove forests in semiarid coasts.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAvicennia germinans 3aLaguncularia racemosa 3aRhizophora mangle 3aaquaculture 3abioturbation 3abrackish water 3acoasts 3aecological restoration 3afauna 3aherbivores 3ahumans 3ahypersalinity 3alittoral zone 3asea level 3ashrimp 3aBrazil1 aFreire, Fúlvio Aurélio Morais1 aRodrigues, José Vitor Machado1 aBezerra, Luis Ernesto Arruda0 tWetlands.g2022 Oct., v. 42, no. 7 p.80-80dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl57834x0277-52127nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13157-022-01603-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02637naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002200140245012500162300001800287500002000305520125400325592002801579650004401607650002101651650002501672650001701697650002201714650001901736650001001755650001901765650001901784650001101803650001101814650001501825650001401840650001701854650001101871650002101882650001301903700003201916773016001948856007402108852000902182655001202191IND60590849920221122061416.0180314e20060301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059084992DNAL7 a10.1002/pola.212862doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStrandberg, Clara10aImprovement of α‐tocopherols long‐term efficiency by modeling its heterogeneous natural environment in polyethylene  ap. 1660-1666.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe natural antioxidant vitamin E (α‐tocopherol) is of interest to use in packaging applications to decrease the amount of toxic products migrating into food and drugs. We have earlier shown that the long‐term efficiency of α‐tocopherol in polyethylene (PE) films is poor. α‐Tocopherol is located in the lipid phase of the cell in vivo and it has been revealed that it is more efficient in a polar substrate. PE is more hydrophobic and homogenous than the heterogeneous and hydrophilic lipid phase. Three different additive systems were investigated to model α‐tocopherols heterogeneous natural environment in PE. Two of these had carboxylic acid groups, EAA and polyTRIM/PAA core‐shell particles (Core), and the third, oat starch, had no carboxylic acid groups. The materials were thermally aged and characterized by chemiluminescence (CL), FTIR, chromatography, and thermal analysis. The EAA system as well as the Core system improved the antioxidant properties of α‐tocopherol in PE, and the Core system had the best performance. We know that starch has stabilizing properties in PE, but it had no effect on the efficiency of α‐tocopherol. © 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

However, whether and how excess nucleolar proteins are removed in normal conditions is unknown. Here we show that overexpressed nucleolar protein Nop1 is toxic and degraded in nutrient-rich conditions in budding yeast. The degradation was dependent on proteasomes. The CUE domain-containing protein Def1 mediated the degradation via the CUE domain and alleviated toxicity of Nop1 overexpression. Def1 was recruited to overexpressed Nop1 in the nucleolus. Ubiquitin mutants compromised this recruitment. This study revealed that Def1 is a novel factor for ubiquitin-dependent degradation of excess nucleolar proteins.  aPublisher supplied data 3acell nucleolus 3aresearch 3atoxicity 3aubiquitin 3ayeasts 0aDef1 0aNop1 0aNucleolar protein 0aProteasome 0aProtein degradation 0aGFP 0aPQC 0aRFP 0aUPS 0aTORC11 aMochida, Takahiro1 aShibata, Ritsu1 aIto, Kisara1 aMostofa, Md Golam1 aRahman, Muhammad Arifur1 aUshimaru, Takashi1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4589-74080 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2019 Nov. 05, v. 519, no. 2 p.302-308dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl46848x0006-291X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2019.09.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02082naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002000152245012700172300001600299520098800315592002801303650001901331650003901350650001501389650002101404650001101425650001201436650001901448700002601467700002301493700002001516700001701536773008401553856008601637852000901723655001201732IND60096293220221119164038.0141104e201212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009629322DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cryobiol.2012.05.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aValle, Marcello10aBirth of normal infants after transfer of embryos that were twice vitrified/warmed at cleavage stages: Report of two cases  ap. 332-334.  aThe role of cryopreservation in assisted reproductive technology programs has increased within the last years allowing the transfer of a limited number of embryos and the storage of the remaining for future use. The reduction in the number of transferred embryos decreases the frequency of multiple pregnancy rates and of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome while the cumulative pregnancy rate can be maximized. Moreover, as not all embryos will survive the warming process more cleavage stage embryos are warmed to improve selection for transfer. Therefore, surplus good quality cleavage stage embryos and/or blastocysts must be re-vitrified for further transfer to achieve pregnancy. To our knowledge, there have been no reports demonstrating that human embryos can be successfully vitrified/warmed twice at the cleavage stage. Thus we report two successful pregnancies and deliveries of healthy babies after transfer of embryos that were twice vitrified/warmed at 2–4 cells stage.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal ovaries 3aassisted reproductive technologies 3ablastocyst 3acryopreservation 3ahumans 3ainfants 3apregnancy rate1 aGuimarães, Fernando,1 aCavagnoli, Melissa1 aSampaio, Marcos1 aGeber, Selmo0 tCryobiology.g2012 Dec., v. 65, no. 3 p.332-334dElsevier Inc.x0011-22407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cryobiol.2012.05.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02647naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245006500167300001200232500001100244520138900255592002801644650001501672650001701687650001501704650002501719650001101744650002401755650001901779650002001798650001301818650002801831650002101859650001301880650001701893700002701910700002001937700005801957773011802015856008302133852000902216655001202225IND60795053520221122065151.0221004e202211  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079505352DNAL7 a10.1007/s13205-022-03361-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDas, Indukalpa10aRole of metal-nanoparticles in farming practices: an insight  ap. 294.  aReview  aNanotechnology introduces revolutionary approaches for agriculture in the form of nano-based pesticides, fertilizers, sensors, weed-controlling agents, enhanced seed germination materials, etc. Even though metal-nanoparticles (NPs) have shown their potential to improve crop yield, the mode of action at the cellular level and fate in the human body and the environment are not well understood yet. Several metal-nanoparticles have been studied extensively by researchers for their active role in enhancing the rate of seed germination and crop quality augmentation which may happen due to several mechanisms such as increased porosity in nano-primed seeds inducing up-regulation of the expression of aquaporin and Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) genes involved in water uptake, improving the root dehydrogenase activity to enhance the water absorption capability, etc. However, researchers have also demonstrated and reported the possible toxicity of NPs in the environment due to their agricultural practices. But the fate of NPs and their environmental impact are still unclear and largely vary based on several factors such as the size of NPs, coating material, mode of discharge and locations, etc. This review thoroughly focuses on the mode of action of various NPs in seed germination and accumulation, translocation through cells, and potential environmental and health risks.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaquaporins 3acrop quality 3acrop yield 3aenvironmental impact 3ahumans 3amechanism of action 3ananotechnology 3aoxidoreductases 3aporosity 3areactive oxygen species 3aseed germination 3atoxicity 3awater uptake1 aGagai, Bhāskarajyoti,1 aSharma, Bidisha1 aBorah, Debajit1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9367-55890 t3 Biotech.g2022 Nov., v. 12, no. 11 p.294-294dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:22884x2190-572X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13205-022-03361-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02266naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001800146245013700164300001800301500001900319520097300338592002801311650002401339650001201363650001401375650001501389650001801404650002301422700001701445700001801462700001801480700002301498700005901521700005701580700001901637773013501656856008001791852000901871655001201880IND60697334820221119115916.0200604e20200508xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069733482DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcb.0c022832doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Geping10aSelf-Stabilized Giant Aggregates in Water from Room-Temperature Ionic Liquids with an Asymmetric Polar–Apolar–Polar Architecture  ap. 4651-4660.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aWe report the assembly of four imidazolium bromides, each of which bears a naphthyl on one side of the imidazolium cation and a branched alkyl chain on the other. This design creates a new type of amphiphilic ionic liquid with an apolar–polar–apolar structure and a low melting point (mₚ, <−20 °C), which has not been achieved by reported counterparts bearing linear alkyl chains. In solvent-free states, microphase segregation occurs where polar and apolar domains arrange bicontinuously as proved by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. When dispersed in water, self-stabilized giant aggregates formed with ultrahigh colloidal stability (up to years). MD simulations provide clues of discrete bicontinuous phases within the giant aggregates. These newly discovered self-assemblies provide a heterogeneous reservoir that can accommodate guest molecules including the highly apolar fullerene C₆₀, paving the way for a wide range of potential applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aambient temperature 3acations 3afullerene 3aimidazoles 3aionic liquids 3amolecular dynamics1 aZhu, Hongxia1 aChen, Jingfei1 aChen, Mengjun1 aKalwarczyk, Tomasz1 aHołyst, Robert1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3211-42861 aLi, Hongguang1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5773-50031 aHao, Jingcheng0 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2020 May 08, v. 124, no. 22 p.4651-4660dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19284x1520-52077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcb.0c022833Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04227naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001500149245012200164300001600286506010400302506007600406520230900482592002802791506003702819650001602856650001402872650001602886650001702902650001802919650002302937650001702960650001502977650001402992650001503006650002803021650001003049650002003059650001603079650001003095650002303105650002003128650001503148650001903163650001003182653001303192653002203205653001503227653002403242653002203266700001303288700001903301700005703320773016703377856008403544852000903628655001203637IND60744366220221207081548.0220809e202109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074436622DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aninu.2020.11.0192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Yanli10aAge-associated changes in caecal microbiome and their apparent correlations with growth performances of layer pullets  ap. 841-848.  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe microbiome in gastrointestinal tracts play an important role in regulating nutrient utilization and absorption, gut immune function, and host growth or development. This study was conducted to investigate the composition and dynamic distribution of caecal microbiota in pullets during the first 16 weeks. Growth performance, immune organs index, and intestinal morphology of pullets were analyzed at 3, 6, 12 and 16 weeks of age. The caecal contents were collected for microbiota analysis by 16S rRNA gene sequencing method. With advancing ages in pullets, the gradually increased average daily feed intake (ADFI), feed conversion ratio (FCR) and intestinal villus height, but the gradually decreased organs index of thymus and bursa were determined. Meanwhile, more abundant caecal bacterial communities were determined from pullets at 12 and 16 weeks of age than those at 3 and 6 weeks of age. Furthermore, the dominant microflora of pullets from different weeks of age were analyzed by using LEfSe: The higher abundance of Blautia, Prevotella, Alistipes, and Eggerthella were found at 6 weeks; Anaerostipes, Oscillospira, Enterococcus and Methanobrevibacter were determined at 12 weeks; and the higher abundance of Parabacteroides, Anaerofustis, Lactobacillus and Butyricimonas were determined at 16 weeks. Further functional predicted analysis by PICRUSt revealed that the endocrine system and carbohydrate metabolism were significantly developed at 3 weeks. The development of the immune system was predicted to be mainly during 6 to 12 weeks, while cardiovascular diseases and circulatory system were during 12 to 16 weeks. In addition, the significantly negative correlation between Bacteroides and villus height, the significantly negative correlation between growth parameters (ADFI and FCR) and Bacteroides, Oscillospira and Alistipes; and the significantly positive relations between growth parameters (ADFI and FCR) and Bilophila, Lactobacillus, Rikenella and Anaerofustis were determined by using Pearson analyses. In conclusion, our data demonstrated that growth performance and intestinal morphology correlate well with caecal microbiota, which could provide new insights to establish or develop nutritional strategies to manage the intestinal health or development of laying pullets.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aBacteroides 3aBilophila 3aEggerthella 3aEnterococcus 3aLactobacillus 3aMethanobrevibacter 3aOscillospira 3aPrevotella 3aRikenella 3aabsorption 3acarbohydrate metabolism 3acecum 3afeed conversion 3afeed intake 3agenes 3agrowth performance 3aimmune response 3amicrobiome 3amicroorganisms 3avilli 0a16S rRNA 0aCaecal microbiota 0aLaying hen 0aDevelopmental stage 0aIntestinal health1 aYan, Tao1 aRen, Zhouzheng1 aYang, Xiaojun1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9702-70390 tAnimal nutrition.g2021 Sept., v. 7, no. 3 p.841-848dElsevier B.V.aChinese Association of Animal Science and Veterinary MedicinewJournal:23216x2405-65457nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aninu.2020.11.0193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03140naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002200148245012300170300001200293520159500305592002801900596010701928650004902035650002402084650002502108650001102133650001402144650001502158650002002173650002002193650001502213650001102228650001402239650001002253650001702263650000702280650001702287650001202304650004102316650001602357700002002373700006702393773011802460856008302578852000902661655001202670IND60795053720221122065317.0221004e202211  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079505372DNAL7 a10.1007/s13205-022-03374-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKhamwan, Sumolnat10aProduction of fructan synthesis/hydrolysis of endophytic bacteria involved in inulin production in Jerusalem artichoke  ap. 296.  aEndophytic bacteria refer to bacteria which promote plant growth via direct and indirect mechanisms. Three endophytic bacteria isolated from Jerusalem artichoke exhibited plant growth induction and inulin production. These bacteria had functions of fructan degradation and synthesis from inulinase and levansucrase, respectively. Rossellomorea aquimaris 3.13 and Priestia megaterium 3.5 obtained inulinase/levanase enzyme with inulin and levan as substrates; enzyme production showed the optimum conditions in 1% inulin medium of 35 °C, pH 7.0. Bacillus velezensis 5.18 and Priestia megaterium 3.5 had inulosucrase/levansucrase enzyme with sucrose as a major carbon source; the enzyme had optimum temperature and pH conditions of 30 °C and pH 7.0, respectively. A combination of carbon sources had effect on decreasing enzyme activity; in addition, co-inoculation of bacteria showed a slight difference in enzyme production compared with single inoculation. The inulosucrase/levansucrase was produced earlier in co-culture containing bacteria with inulinase activity. Plant fructan synthesis was involved in 1-SST and 1-FFT, while 1-FEH encoded inulin degradation; these genes were evaluated in Jerusalem artichoke inoculated with the endophytic bacteria to quantify gene expression level using qPCR. All genes expressed in low levels at early stage of growth, responding to all endophytic bacteria. Significantly, Bacillus velezensis 5.18 induced all genes of the plant at 65 days of inoculation; Rossellomorea aquimaris 3.13 induced 1-FFT while Priestia megaterium 3.5 induced 1-SST.  aPublisher supplied data  aProject B05F630053cOffice of National Higher Education Science Research and Innovation Policy Council 3a1,2-beta-D-fructan 1(F)-fructosyltransferase 3aBacillus velezensis 3aJerusalem artichokes 3acarbon 3acoculture 3aendophytes 3aenzyme activity 3agene expression 3ahydrolysis 3ainulin 3ainulinase 3alevan 3alevansucrase 3apH 3aplant growth 3asucrose 3asucrose:sucrose fructosyltransferase 3atemperature1 aBoonlue, Sophon1 aMongkolthanaruk, Wiyada1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0954-81470 t3 Biotech.g2022 Nov., v. 12, no. 11 p.296-296dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:22884x2190-572X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13205-022-03374-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03868naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001800149245018100167300001600348506011700364506007600481520171200557592002802269506003702297650002602334650001502360650001702375650001902392650002102411650001402432650003102446650001602477650001402493650002302507650002402530650000902554650002002563650002302583650001702606650001102623650002102634650002302655650001402678650002002692653002402712653003602736653002102772653003102793653002602824700001902850700002002869700001602889700001102905700001402916700005202930773016702982856008403149852000903233655001203242IND60744366320221207081531.0220809e202109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074436632DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aninu.2021.02.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuang, Haoyan10aN-carbamoylglutamate improves lipid metabolism, inflammation, and apoptosis responses in visceral adipocytes of Japanese seabass (Lateolabrax japonicus), in vivo and in vitro  ap. 707-715.  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThis study applied in vivo and in vitro methods to investigate the effect of dietary N-carbamoylglutamate (NCG) on lipid metabolism, inflammation and apoptosis related-gene expression in visceral adipose tissue and isolated adipocytes of Japanese seabass (Lateolabrax japonicus). A basal diet and a test diet supplemented with 720 mg/kg NCG were fed to the fish for 10 weeks. During the growth trial, no mortality and no significant differences in growth performance were observed in fish between the 2 groups (P > 0.05). Plasma Arg content and mRNA level of argininosuccinate synthetase (ASS) in adipose tissue were significantly increased, which indicated that NCG inclusion promoted endogenous Arg synthesis. Thereafter, the potential effects of NCG treatment on lipid metabolism-related genes expression were studied through in vivo and in vitro methods. In the present study, we successfully established a primary adipocytes culture system and isolated pre-adipocytes in vitro of Japanese seabass for the first time. Both the results in vivo and in vitro showed that NCG treatment decreased the mRNA levels of genes related to adipogenesis (fatty acid synthase, FASN), cholesterol synthesis (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase, HMGCR) and fat deposition (lipoprotein lipase [LPL] and leptin), which revealed the underlying mechanism of NCG on reducing fat deposition. The results of this study demonstrated that NCG inclusion reduced the expression of inflammatory and apoptosis cytokines markedly in vivo and in vitro. In conclusion, NCG did exert beneficial effects on ameliorating adipogenesis, inflammation and apoptosis via promoting Arg endogenous synthesis in Japanese seabass.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aLateolabrax japonicus 3aadipocytes 3aadipogenesis 3aadipose tissue 3aanimal nutrition 3aapoptosis 3aargininosuccinate synthase 3acholesterol 3acytokines 3aexperimental diets 3afatty-acid synthase 3afish 3agene expression 3agrowth performance 3ainflammation 3aleptin 3alipid metabolism 3alipoprotein lipase 3amortality 3aoxidoreductases 0aN-Carbamylglutamate 0aVisceral adipose and adipocytes 0aLipid metabolism 0aInflammatory and apoptosis 0aLateolabrax japonicus1 aZhang, Xiaoran1 aLiang, Xiaofang1 aWu, Xiufeng1 aGu, Xu1 aHan, Juan1 aXue, Min1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9484-062X0 tAnimal nutrition.g2021 Sept., v. 7, no. 3 p.707-715dElsevier B.V.aChinese Association of Animal Science and Veterinary MedicinewJournal:23216x2405-65457nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aninu.2021.02.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01407naa a2200253 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002200139245013500161300001600296500001100312520048700323592002800810650001900838650002200857650001500879773016500894856007301059852000901132655001201141IND60518988420221121064314.0160419e201606  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051898842DNAL7 a10.1111/bij.127402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSmith, Charles H.10aDid Wallace's Ternate essay and letter on natural selection come as a reply to Darwin's letter of 22 December 1857?

Nano-carriers for intracellular uptake of anticancer drugs  aA new fully biodegradable “reverse” oligosaccharide-based amphiphilic graft copolymer structure with a hydrophobic backbone and hydrophilic side chains, poly(ε-caprolactone)-g-dextran (PCL-g-Dex) was synthetized. For this purpose, “clickable” propargylated PCL (PCL-yne) and azido-dextran (Dex-N3) were prepared to further synthesize PCL-g-Dex copolymer by a Huisgen’s cycloaddition. This “reverse” copolymer architecture self-assembled in biodegradable nano-carriers, in the shape of dynamic polymeric micelles, and were loaded with doxorubicin (Dox) anti-cancer drug. Dox-loaded micelles showed different drug releases depending on the pH. Cytotoxicity tests showed that Dox-loaded micelles can selectively kill colon cancer cells (HCT-116) while they have no cytotoxic effect towards healthy cells (CCD-45SK). Fluorescent micelles based on FITC-labelled PCL-g-Dex copolymer were used for fluorescence imaging and flow cytometry assays. These experiments proved the effective and specific internalization of micelles by cancer cells, whereas healthy cells showed a very poor uptake. These results show that PCL-g-Dex micelles may be a promising Dox nano-carrier in cancer chemotherapy.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiodegradability 3acolorectal neoplasms 3acomposite polymers 3acycloaddition reactions 3acytotoxicity 3adoxorubicin 3adrug therapy 3aflow cytometry 3afluorescence 3ahydrophilicity 3ahydrophobicity 3aimage analysis 3alactones 3amicelles 3ananocarriers 3aneoplasm cells 3apH 0aDextran 0aPoly(ε-caprolactone) 0aGraft copolymers 0aBiodegradable micelles 0aDrug delivery 0aAnti-cancer therapy1 aLichon, Laure1 aMahindad, Hana1 aHunger, Sylvie1 aLaroui, Nabila1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6125-65151 aDaurat, Morgane1 aGodefroy, Anastasia1 aCoudane, Jean1 aGary-Bobo, Magali1 aVan Den Berghe, Hélène0 tCarbohydrate polymers.g2020 Mar. 15, v. 232 p.115764-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl47819x0144-86177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbpol.2019.1157643Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03521naa a2200649 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245011100165300001600276500001900292520169500311592002802006650001902034650001702053650001502070650002202085650001802107650001902125650002602144650001402170650002102184650001602205650001402221650002202235650001502257650001302272650001002285653002002295653002802315653002302343653000702366653000802373653000702381653000802388653001002396653001202406653001102418653000802429653000702437700001302444700001502457700001602472700001302488700001502501700001502516700001702531700001602548700005702564773014602621856008302767852000902850655001202859IND60662795420221120054726.0191004e20191105xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066279542DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbrc.2019.09.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Xuebin10aMelatonin alleviates cigarette smoke-induced endothelial cell pyroptosis through inhibiting ROS/NLRP3 axis  ap. 402-408.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aEndothelial dysfunction (ED) is a crucial and initial stage for the development of cardiovascular diseases. Accumulated evidence has demonstrated causative links between cigarette smoke (CS) and ED. However, the underlying mechanisms remain largely unknown. Pyroptosis is a unique form of inflammatory cell death. In this study, we found that cigarette smoke extract (CSE) increased pyroptosis in endothelial cells (ECs) as evidenced by increasing lactate dehydrogenase release and the number of propidium iodide (PI) positive cells. A specific NOD-like receptor family, pyrin domain-containing 3 (NLRP3) inhibitor (MCC950) pretreatment dramatically reduced CSE-induced pyroptosis. Additionally, we also observed that N-Acetylcysteine (NAC, a ROS scavenger) pretreatment inhibited NLRP3 inflammasome activation as evidenced by suppressing the upregulation of NLRP3, ASC, cleaved-caspase-1, GSDMD-N, IL-1β and IL-18 protein levels in CSE-treated ECs. Meanwhile, NAC pretreatment also remarkably inhibited CSE-induced EC pyroptosis. Melatonin is a hormone synthesized and secreted by mammalian pineal gland and plays a protective role in various cardiovascular diseases through its powerful anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. In this study, melatonin was observed to inhibit ROS production, NLRP3 inflammasome activation and pyroptosis in CSE-treated ECs. Moreover, oxidative stress and NLRP3 inflammasome activation in carotid arteries of smoking rats was also inhibited by melatonin. In conclusion, our study generated two novel findings, (i) CS activates ROS/NLRP3 axis and induces EC pyroptosis; (ii) melatonin attenuates CS-induced EC pyroptosis by inhibiting ROS/NLRP3 axis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetylcysteine 3aantioxidants 3acigarettes 3aendothelial cells 3ainflammasomes 3ainterleukin-18 3alactate dehydrogenase 3amelatonin 3aoxidative stress 3apineal body 3apropidium 3aprotective effect 3apyroptosis 3aresearch 3asmoke 0aCigarette smoke 0aEndothelial dysfunction 0aNLRP3 inflammasome 0aED 0aECs 0aCS 0aCSE 0aNLRP3 0aGSDMD-N 0aHUVECs 0aLDH 0aPI1 aBian, Ye1 aZhang, Rui1 aLiu, Xudong1 aNi, Leng1 aMa, Baitao1 aZeng, Rong1 aZhao, Zhewei1 aSong, Xitao1 aLiu, Changwei1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8718-01440 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2019 Nov. 05, v. 519, no. 2 p.402-408dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl46848x0006-291X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2019.09.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02530naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001500146245013000161300001800291500001900309520141900328592002801747650001701775650001101792650002201803650001301825650001601838650002301854700002001877700001701897700005401914773013501968856008002103852000902183655001202192IND60697335220221119115541.0200604e20200505xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069733522DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcb.0c025222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGong, Zhou14aThe Conformational Preference of Chemical Cross-linkers Determines the Cross-linking Probability of Reactive Protein Residues  ap. 4446-4453.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aChemical cross-linking mass spectrometry (XLMS) is an emerging technique in structural biology. Providing the cross-linked peptides are identified by mass spectrometry with high confidence, a distance restraint can be applied between the two reactive protein residues, with the upper bound corresponding to the maximal span of the cross-linker. However, as the upper bound is typically over 20 Å, cross-link distance restraints are unrestrictive and provide a marginal improvement in protein structural refinement. Here we analyze the experimental cross-links for lysine or acidic residues and show that the distribution of Cβ-Cβ′ distances can be described with two overlapping Gaussian species. In addition to the pairwise occurrence probability of the reactive protein residues, we show that the distribution profile of the cross-link distances is determined by the intrinsic conformational propensity of the cross-linker. The cross-linker prefers either a compact or extended conformation and, once attached to a reactive protein residue, predominantly an extended conformation. Consequently, the long-distance Gaussian species occurs at a much higher probability than the short-distance species in the observed cross-links. Together, the probabilistic distribution of the cross-link distance allows the construction of a more restrictive restraint for structural modeling and better use of the XLMS data.  aPublisher supplied data 3acrosslinking 3alysine 3amass spectrometry 3apeptides 3aprobability 3astructural biology1 aYe, Shang-Xiang1 aNie, Ze-Feng1 aTang, Chun1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6477-65000 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2020 May 05, v. 124, no. 22 p.4446-4453dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19284x1520-52077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcb.0c025223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02341naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245015400170300001800324520109300342592002801435650004401463650001601507650002301523650002101546650002101567650001901588650002401607650001901631650003301650650001501683650001601698650002201714700003001736773010601766856008601872852000901958655001201967IND60580159120221119093332.0170912e20170912xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058015912DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.macromol.7b014572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrown, Emily

BA-a can be homogeneously dispersed in both polymers where a wide loading range of ∼100–40 wt % BA-a is possible. The cure temperature for blended BA-a/mPEGOTs was up to 50 °C less than that of pure BA-a or mPEGOH blends. It is proposed that nucleophilic attack of BA-a on the end-group of mPEGOTs produces free tosylate and cationic BA-a-based initiators that act as cure catalystswhere the former was detected by TGA-FTIR and TGA-MS. H-NMR and FTIR revealed the polybenzoxazine (PBA-a) synthesized in mPEGOTs consists of a phenolic rich molecular structure with H-bonded hydroxyl residues and grafted PEG-chains. SEM confirmed that this material, P(BA-a)-graft-mPEGOTs, has a homogeneous microstructure. The glass transition and the thermal stability of the P(BA-a)-graft-mPEGOTs can be tuned based on the blend composition.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aLewis bases 3achemical structure 3aglass transition 3ahydrogen bonding 3amicrostructure 3apolyethylene glycol 3apolymerization 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asolubility 3atemperature 3athermal stability1 aRider, D.

This paper presents an investigation into optimal WT layout patterns for three OWF configurations (aligned, staggered, scattered) in HK (Hong Kong) waters. A hypothetical OWF (6930 m × 9072 m) are analysed based on twenty years of wind data (1992–2011). For the aligned and staggered WFs, different WT layout separations are studied. The separations varied between 5.0D and 15.0D along the PWD (prevailing wind direction) and 5.0D to 12.0D in the CWD (crosswind direction), where D is the WT rotor diameter. A range of 25 and 45 WTs are placed in the scattered WF, with their layout optimized using the Multi-Population Genetic Algorithm. WF performance is reported for the best ten layout patterns following studies of many different layouts. Results show for this hypothetical OWF, that the optimal WT separation is 14.5D in the PWD and 11.0D in the CWD for the aligned and staggered cases. Thirty WTs are recommended as the optimum number for the scattered WF. The LCOE (levelized costs of energy) were calculated in HK$ terms 1.474/kWh (aligned), 1.467/kWh (staggered), and 1.290/kWh (scattered). APG (annual energy generation) is determined to be 40.80 × 10⁸ kWh (aligned), 40.42 × 10⁸ kWh (staggered), and 33.98 × 10⁸ kWh (scattered), representing 9.48% (aligned), 9.39% (staggered), and 7.89% (scattered) of the annual electricity consumption for HK in 2012. The approach presented can be regarded as a generic method for WT layout optimization.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3aelectric energy consumption 3aenergy 3awind direction 3awind farms 3awind turbines 3aChina 0aOffshore wind farm 0aWind farm configurations 0aOptimal WT (wind turbine) layout pattern 0aAnnual power generation1 aYang, Hongxing1 aLü, Lin,0 tEnergy.g2014 Aug. 14, v. 73 p.430-442dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2014.06.0333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03326naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245008200171300001600253520200200269592002802271650004102299650002002340650001102360650001302371650001102384650001302395650001902408650002802427651001202455653002502467653001702492653001502509653002002524700006002544700006002604700003902664773011802703856008602821852000902907655001202916IND60629772120221118074025.0190206e20180715xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062977212DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jenvman.2018.04.0532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchlör, Holger10aManaging the resilience space of the German energy system - A vector analysis  ap. 527-539.  aThe UN Sustainable Development Goals formulated in 2016 confirmed the sustainability concept of the Earth Summit of 1992 and supported UNEP's green economy transition concept. The transformation of the energy system (Energiewende) is the keystone of Germany's sustainability strategy and of the German green economy concept. We use ten updated energy-related indicators of the German sustainability strategy to analyse the German energy system. The development of the sustainable indicators is examined in the monitoring process by a vector analysis performed in two-dimensional Euclidean space (Euclidean plane).The aim of the novel vector analysis is to measure the current status of the Energiewende in Germany and thereby provide decision makers with information about the strains for the specific remaining pathway of the single indicators and of the total system in order to meet the sustainability targets of the Energiewende.Within this vector model, three vectors (the normative sustainable development vector, the real development vector, and the green economy vector) define the resilience space of our analysis. The resilience space encloses a number of vectors representing different pathways with different technological and socio-economic strains to achieve a sustainable development of the green economy. In this space, the decision will be made as to whether the government measures will lead to a resilient energy system or whether a readjustment of indicator targets or political measures is necessary.The vector analysis enables us to analyse both the government's ambitiousness, which is expressed in the sustainability target for the indicators at the start of the sustainability strategy representing the starting preference order of the German government (SPO) and, secondly, the current preference order of German society in order to bridge the remaining distance to reach the specific sustainability goals of the strategy summarized in the current preference order (CPO).  aPublisher supplied data 3aUnited Nations Environment Programme 3adecision making 3aenergy 3ageometry 3amodels 3apolitics 3asocioeconomics 3asustainable development 3aGermany 0aGerman energy system 0aEnergiewende 0aResilience 0aVector analysis1 aVenghaus, Sandra1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9352-66041 aMärker, Carolin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7521-03071 aHake, J.-Fr.q(Jürgen-Friedrich),0 tJournal of environmental management.g2018 July 15, v. 218 p.527-539dElsevier LtdwJournal:2018x0301-47977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2018.04.0533Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02401naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001500150245008400165500001900249520130200268592002801570650001101598650001901609650002201628650001101650651001001661653003201671653002001703653002201723653003001745700001201775700001301787700005501800773009001855856008501945852000902030655001202039IND60714981720221120083636.0210415e20210101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071498172DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2020.1190632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuo, Siyue10aModelling building energy consumption in China under different future scenarios  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aBuilding energy use is becoming increasingly important in China. Despite a rapid growth in recent years, energy use intensity in China is still relatively low compared to other advanced economies; thus, there is still substantial room for it to increase as living standards and industrial services are improved. It is therefore important to focus on the future development of building energy use by considering new trends in the building and energy sectors, as well as the role of occupant behavior. This study uses the China Building Energy Model (CBEM) to model China’s building energy consumption and carbon emissions up to 2050 for different scenarios based on these considerations. The results indicate that building energy use will be 80% higher than the current situation if the strategies of the 13th Five-Year Plan are maintained and approximately 10% higher if stronger strategies toward energy efficiency are employed. Carbon emissions are predicted to peak around 2020 to 2035. The contributions of key strategies in different subsectors are also discussed. This research suggests that, through the use of suitable strategies and policies, energy use and carbon emissions in China’s building sector can achieve the combined goals of energy revolution and climate change mitigation.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3aclimate change 3aenergy efficiency 3amodels 3aChina 0aBuilding energy consumption 0aCarbon emission 0aScenario analysis 0aClimate change mitigation1 aYan, Da1 aHu, Shan1 aZhang, Yang1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2674-11840 tEnergy.g2021 Jan. 01, v. 214 p.119063-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2020.1190633Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02591naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100006700146245013500213300001800348500001900366520132100385592002801706650000801734650001501742650002001757650001001777650002401787650002301811650001501834650001801849650001301867700005801880700006701938773013502005856008002140852000902220655001202229IND60697335420221119115705.0200604e20200511xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069733542DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcb.0c026092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSowlati-Hashjin, Shahin1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6968-153510aInsights into the Polyhexamethylene Biguanide (PHMB) Mechanism of Action on Bacterial Membrane and DNA: A Molecular Dynamics Study  ap. 4487-4497.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aPolyhexamethylene biguanide (PHMB) is a cationic polymer with antimicrobial and antiviral properties. It has been commonly accepted that the antimicrobial activity is due to the ability of PHMB to perforate the bacterial phospholipid membrane leading ultimately to its death. In this study, we show by the means of atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) simulations that, while the PHMB molecules attach to the surface of the phospholipid bilayer and partially penetrate it, they do not cause any pore formation at least within the microsecond simulation times. The polymers initially adsorb onto the membrane surface via the favorable electrostatic interactions between the phospholipid headgroups and the biguanide groups and then partially penetrate the membrane slightly disrupting its structure. This, however, does not lead to the formation of any pores. The microsecond-scale simulations reveal that it is unlikely for PHMB to spontaneously pass through the phospholipid membrane. Our findings suggest that PHMB translocation across the bilayer may take place through binding to the phospholipids. Once inside the cell, the polymer can effectively “bind” to DNA through extensive interactions with DNA phosphate backbone, which can potentially block the DNA replication process or activate DNA repair pathways.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aDNA repair 3aDNA replication 3adeath 3amechanism of action 3amolecular dynamics 3aphosphates 3aphospholipids 3apolymers1 aCarbone, Paola1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9927-83761 aKarttunen, M.q(Mikko),1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8626-30330 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2020 May 11, v. 124, no. 22 p.4487-4497dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19284x1520-52077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcb.0c026093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02719naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001800139245006800157300001600225520161200241592002801853650002001881650002601901650001201927650001001939650002001949650001401969650001101983650001201994650002002006650002402026650001102050650001402061700002302075773016502098856007302263852000902336655001202345IND60518988720221121014217.0160419e201606  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051898872DNAL7 a10.1111/bij.127442doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBooth, Warren14aThe emerging phylogenetic pattern of parthenogenesis in snakes  ap. 172-186.  aParthenogenesis occurs across a variety of vertebrate taxa. Within squamate reptiles (lizards and snakes), a group for which the largest number of cases has been documented, both obligate and facultative types of parthenogenesis exists, although the obligate form in snakes appears to be restricted to a single basal species of blind snake, Indotyphlops braminus. By contrast, a number of snake species that otherwise reproduce sexually have been found capable of facultative parthenogenesis. Because the original documentation of this phenomenon was restricted to subjects held in captivity and isolated from males, facultative parthenogenesis was attributed as a captive syndrome. However, its recent discovery in nature shifts the paradigm and identifies this form of reproduction as a potentially important feature of vertebrate evolution. In light of the growing number of documented cases of parthenogenesis, it is now possible to review the phylogenetic distribution in snakes and thus identify subtle variations and commonalities that may exist through the characterization of its emerging properties. Based on our findings, we propose partitioning facultative parthenogenesis in snakes into two categories, type A and type B, based on the sex of the progeny produced, their viability, sex chromosome morphology, and ploidy, as well as their phylogenetic position. Furthermore, we introduce a hypothesis (directionality of heterogamety hypothesis) to explain the production of female‐only parthenogens in basal alethinophidian snakes and male‐only parthenogens in caenophidian (advanced) snakes.  aPublisher supplied data 3acaptive animals 3achromosome morphology 3alizards 3amales 3aparthenogenesis 3aphylogeny 3aploidy 3aprogeny 3asex chromosomes 3asexual reproduction 3asnakes 3aviability1 aSchuett, Gordon W.0 tBiological journal of the Linnean Society.g2016 June, v. 118, no. 2 p.172-186dPublished for the Linnean Society of London by Blackwell [etc.]x0024-40667nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/bij.127443Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02309naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245009500171300001600266520116000282592002801442650001901470650001501489650001101504650001701515650000901532650001601541650001701557650002501574650002001599653001501619653001601634653002401650653001601674700002001690700001801710773009001728856008401818852000901902655001201911IND60600481620221123044322.0180703e20140901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060048162DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2014.06.0382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLambert, Tristan10aProcess integration of solar thermal energy with natural gas combined cycle carbon capture  ap. 248-253.  aThis project investigates the energy cost of CO2 capture for NGCC (natural gas combined cycle) power plants and studies the effect of solar thermal energy on the energy penalty for such a system.The gas turbine used in this study is the ALSTOM GT26. Alongside the standard case, other cases include an EGR (exhaust gas recirculation) and a pre-combustion case that utilises EGR with the capture taking place after the compression stage of the gas turbine. The solar thermal technology used in these simulations is a solar tower system capable of reaching 1000 °C. The integration of the solar energy is used to provide heat to the first of the two combustion chambers in the gas turbine. Cases are optimized for 75% capture.For a NGCC it was found that using EGR decreased the specific energy penalty as well as capture energy penalty. The pre-combustion case showed a reduction in the energy penalty over the standard and EGR cases but at a reduced capture rate. The addition of solar thermal shows a reduction in the total energy penalty. This is due to a reduction in the total CO2 produced in the system, hence a reduction in the total CO2 captured.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon dioxide 3acombustion 3aenergy 3aenergy costs 3aheat 3anatural gas 3apower plants 3asolar thermal energy 3aspecific energy 0aAbsorption 0aALSTOM GT26 0aPotassium carbonate 0aSolar tower1 aHoadley, Andrew1 aHooper, Barry0 tEnergy.g2014 Sept. 01, v. 74 p.248-253dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2014.06.0383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02729naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002500110245009700135300001800232520151400250592002801764650002801792650001001820650001701830650003101847650001601878650003101894650002501925650001401950650001801964650002201982651001102004700002102015700002602036700002102062700001802083700001702101700002502118773017902143852000902322655001202331IND4501243620221121231714.0150420e201112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND450124362DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChimetto, Luciane A.10aVibrio variabilis sp. nov. and Vibrio maritimus sp. nov., isolated from Palythoa caribaeorum  ap. 3009-3015.  aTwo novel vibrio isolates (R-40492T and R-40493T) originating from the zoanthid Palythoa caribaeorum in Brazil in 2005 were taxonomically characterized by means of a polyphasic approach comprising multilocus sequence analysis (MLSA), DNAâDNA hybridization (DDH), ÎTm analysis and phenotypic characterization. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences showed that R-40492T and R-40493T fell within the genus Vibrio and were most closely related to each other with 99 % similarity; similarities of these two novel isolates towards Vibrio neptunius LMG 20536T, Vibrio coralliilyticus LMG 20984T, Vibrio nigripulchritudo LMG 3896T, Vibrio sinaloensis LMG 25238T and Vibrio brasiliensis LMG 20546T varied between 97.1 and 98.5 %. DDH experiments showed that the two isolates had less than 15 % relatedness to the phylogenetically most closely related Vibrio species. R-40492T and R-40493T had 55â57 % relatedness to each other. The ÎTm between R-40492T and R-40493T was 6.12 Â°C. In addition, MLSA of concatenated sequences (16S rRNA, ftsZ, gyrB, recA, rpoA, topA, pyrH and mreB; 6035 bp in length) showed that the two novel isolates formed a separate branch with less than 92 % concatenated gene sequence similarity towards known species of vibrios. Two novel species are proposed to accommodate these novel isolates, namely Vibrio variabilis sp. nov. (type strain, R-40492T = LMG 25438T = CAIM 1454T) and Vibrio maritimus sp. nov.

Despite the fact that BM is conserved among organisms and is essential to stabilize recombination intermediates, which occurs by avoiding the reversal of strand exchange leading to the faithful repair of DSBs, molecular insights into the BM process including kinetics, the effects of microenvironments, and the role of HJ-binding proteins are poorly understood. In this article, using single-molecule fluorescence analysis of a synthetic, mobile HJ as a model system, we systematically investigated the effects of cell-mimic solvent composition and crowding on BM by varying the concentration of cosolutes, namely dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG). The single-molecule analyses revealed that BM is affected by cosolutes in a concentration-dependent manner. In addition, the kinetic analysis of the fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) traces showed that the BM is significantly accelerated under the crowding environments. The finding that the mobility of the HJ is enhanced by cell-like environments not only provides a better insight into BM but also may open up new avenues for targeting HJs and the associated BM process for possible therapeutic interventions.  aPublisher supplied data  aNAcVirginia Commonwealth Universitydhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100009238 3aDNA 3abiomimetics 3adimethyl sulfoxide 3aenergy transfer 3afluorescence 3ahomologous recombination 3akinetics 3aphysical chemistry 3asolutes 3asolvents 3atherapeutics1 aDhakal, Soma1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3734-139X0 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2022 Sept. 14, v. 126, no. 38 p.7252-7261dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19284x1520-52077nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcb.2c031533Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03510naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245008500167300001600252520218800268592002802456650001202484650001702496650002002513650002602533650003202559650001502591650001502606650004302621650001302664650001902677650001402696650001502710650001802725650002102743650001402764651001002778700002702788700003202815773013502847856008502982852000903067655001203076IND60630017620221119231951.0190204e20190201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063001762DNAL7 a10.1080/01431161.2018.15192842doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAmos, Craig10aDetermining the use of Sentinel-2A MSI for wildfire burning & severity detection  ap. 905-930.  aAccurate, reliable, and timely burn severity maps are necessary for planning, managing and rehabilitation after wildfires. This study aimed at assessing the ability of the Sentinel-2A satellite to detect burnt areas and separate burning severity levels. It also attempted to measure the spectral separability of the different bands and derived indices commonly used to detect burnt areas. A short investigation into the associated environmental variables present in the burnt landscape was also performed to explore the presence of any correlation. As a case study, a wildfire occurred in the Sierra de Gata region of the province of Caceres in North-Eastern Spain was used. A range of spectral indices was computed, including the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and the Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR). The potential added value of the three new Red Edge bands that come with the Sentinel-2A MSI sensor was also used. The slope, aspect, fractional vegetation cover and terrain roughness were all derived to produce environmental variables. The burning severity was tested using the Spectral Angle Mapper (SAM) classifier. European Environment Agency’s CORINE land cover map was also used to produce the land cover types found in the burned area. The Copernicus Emergency Management Service have produced a grading map for the fire using 0.5 m resolution Pleiades imagery, that was used as reference. Results showed a variable degree of correlation between the burning severity and the tested herein spectral indices. The visible part of the electromagnetic spectrum was not well suited to discern burned from unburned land cover. The NBRb12 (short-wave infrared 2 – SWIR2) produced the best results for detecting burnt areas. SAM resulted in a 73% overall accuracy in thematic mapping. None of the environmental variables appeared to have a significant impact on the burning severity. All in all, our study result showed that Sentinel-2 MSI sensor can be used to discern burnt areas and burning severity. However, further studies in different regions using the same dataset types and methods should be implemented before generalizing the results of the current study.  aPublisher supplied data 3aburning 3acase studies 3adata collection 3aenvironmental factors 3afractional vegetation cover 3aland cover 3alandscapes 3anormalized difference vegetation index 3aplanning 3aremote sensing 3aroughness 3asatellites 3athematic maps 3avegetation types 3awildfires 3aSpain1 aPetropoulos, George P.1 aFerentinos, Konstantinos P.0 tInternational journal of remote sensing.g2019 Feb. 1, v. 40, no. 3 p.905-930dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl45620x1366-59017nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01431161.2018.15192843Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03846naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245009200171300001400263520212800277592002802405650001202433650001902445650002302464650001502487650003402502650002902536650001302565650001302578650001102591650001402602650002402616650002302640650002202663650002102685650001202706650002102718653001202739653002402751653001402775653001402789653003102803700005602834700001702890700001502907700006202922700002202984700001803006700005703024773011603081856008603197852000903283655001203292IND60629772520221118074008.0190206e20180715xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062977252DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jenvman.2018.04.0572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDeng, Shuanghui12aA kinetic study on the catalysis of KCl, K2SO4, and K2CO3 during oxy-biomass combustion  ap. 50-58.  aBiomass combustion under the oxy-fuel conditions (Oxy-biomass combustion) is one of the approaches achieving negative CO2 emissions. KCl, K2CO3 and K2SO4, as the major potassium species in biomass ash, can catalytically affect biomass combustion. In this paper, the catalysis of the representative potassium salts on oxy-biomass combustion was studied using a thermogravimetric analyzer (TGA). Effects of potassium salt types (KCl, K2CO3 and K2SO4), loading concentrations (0, 1, 3, 5, 8 wt%), replacing N2 by CO2, and O2 concentrations (5, 20, 30 vol%) on the catalysis degree were discussed. The comparison between TG-DTG curves of biomass combustion before and after water washing in both the 20%O2/80%N2 and 20%O2/80%CO2 atmospheres indicates that the water-soluble minerals in biomass play a role in promoting the devolatilization and accelerating the char-oxidation; and the replacement of N2 by CO2 inhibits the devolatilization and char-oxidation processes during oxy-biomass combustion. In the devolatilization stage, the catalysis degree of potassium monotonously increases with the increase of potassium salt loaded concentration. The catalysis degree order of the studied potassium salts is K2CO3 > KCl > K2SO4. In the char-oxidation stage, with the increase of loading concentration the three kinds of potassium salts present inconsistent change tendencies of the catalysis degree. In the studied loading concentrations from 0 to 8 wt%, there is an optimal loading concentration for KCl and K2CO3, at 3 and 5 wt%, respectively; while for K2SO4, the catalysis degree on char-oxidation monotonically increases with the loading potassium concentration. For most studied conditions, regardless of the potassium salt types or the loading concentrations or the combustion stages, the catalysis degree in the O2/CO2 atmosphere is stronger than that in the O2/N2 atmosphere. The catalysis degree is also affected by the O2 concentrations, and the lowest catalysis degree is generally around 20 vol% O2 concentration. The kinetic parameters under the different studied conditions are finally obtained.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiomass 3acarbon dioxide 3acatalytic activity 3acombustion 3adifferential thermal analysis 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3aminerals 3anitrogen 3aoxygen 3apotassium 3apotassium carbonate 3apotassium chloride 3apotassium sulfate 3athermogravimetry 3awashing 3awater solubility 0aBiomass 0aOxy-fuel combustion 0aCatalysis 0aPotassium 0aThermogravimetric analysis1 aWang, Xuebin1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4270-73301 aZhang, Jiaye1 aLiu, Zihan1 aMikulčić, Hrvoje1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7502-23811 aVujanović, Milan1 aTan, Houzhang1 aDuić, Neven,1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2376-64660 tJournal of environmental management.g2018 July 15, v. 218 p.50-58dElsevier LtdwJournal:2018x0301-47977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2018.04.0573Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03131naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100006400140245014500204300001600349500002000365520188200385592002802267650002602295650001702321650001502338650001702353650001902370650001802389650001102407650001602418650001702434650001502451700002002466700002202486700002202508773013102530856007502661852000902736655001202745IND60788218320221120115319.0220811e202107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078821832DNAL7 a10.1002/jeq2.202492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStephens, Cameron M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4708-966910aInfluence of post‐application irrigation and mowing timing on fungicide fate on a United States Golf Association golf course putting green  ap. 868-876.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aFungicides are routinely applied to golf course putting greens throughout the growing season. Gaining a better understanding of fungicide fate can improve fungicide use and stewardship. Therefore, optimizing fungicide applications with post‐application management practices may enhance fungicide movement and limit potential off‐target effects. Two field studies were initiated on a golf course putting green to evaluate the influence of post‐fungicide application irrigation and mowing timing on fungicide movement into the soil profile and removal in turfgrass clippings. Plots were treated with a single application of either pyraclostrobin, triadimefon, or penthiopyrad and received 0.64 cm post‐application irrigation immediately or 6 h after application or received no post‐application irrigation. Clippings were collected 0, 1, and 3 d after treatment (DAT). Cores were harvested 0, 1, 3, 5, 7, and 14 DAT and dissected into the remaining aboveground vegetation (RAV; verdure/thatch; 0‐to‐2.5‐, 2.5‐to‐5.1‐, and 5.1‐to‐7.6‐cm soil subsections). A small amount of fungicide (<3.6%) was removed with clippings regardless of mowing and irrigation treatment. Post‐application irrigation treatment influenced fungicide movement; however, >50% of fungicide remained restricted to the RAV for the first 3 DAT. Less fungicide remained restricted to the RAV, and more fungicide was detected in deeper soil depths when plots were irrigated immediately after application. Fungicide was only detected at the 5.1‐to‐7.6‐cm depth when plots were irrigated immediately. Applying post‐application irrigation immediately may result in more fungicide moving down to soilborne targets. Irrigating 6 h after application facilitated moderate fungicide movement compared with irrigating immediately but was better than no post‐application irrigation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenvironmental quality 3agolf courses 3airrigation 3apenthiopyrad 3apyraclostrobin 3asoil profiles 3athatch 3atriadimefon 3aturf grasses 3avegetation1 aKerns, James P.1 aAhmed, Khalied A.1 aGannon, Travis W.0 tJournal of environmental quality.g2021 July, v. 50, no. 4 p.868-876dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl1642x0047-24257nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jeq2.202493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03096naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100002600154245006500180300001600245520167500261592002801936650002901964650000901993650001002002650002602012650001302038650001202051650001502063650002002078650001302098650001402111650001102125650001002136651001102146653002602157653001902183653002002202653002102222700002602243700002202269700002802291700002002319700001702339773016102356856008802517852000902605655001202614IND60744185720221119091950.0210710e20210709xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074418572DNAL7 a10.3161/15081109ACC2021.23.1.0192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aApoznański, Grzegorz10aBarbastelles in a Production Landscape: Where Do They Roost?  ap. 225-232.  aExtensive areas of old forests have declined all over the temperate regions of Europe mainly due to extensive forestry. This is likely to have negative impact on bats that roost in trees, such as the western barbastelle Barbastella barbastellus. We investigated its selection of summer roosts in a commercially used landscape in southern Sweden. We captured and radio-tracked 14 bats and found 17 occupied roosts. Nine of the roosts, including two used by a maternity colony (ca. 30 females), were located between overlapping boards on the gables of barns. The remaining eight roosts, all used by single individuals, were under lose bark on thin trees (DBH = 0.2–0.35 m). All recorded roosts had entrances pointing downwards, were adjacent to deciduous trees providing protective darkness, and were in areas without artificial lighting. In the barns, the bats avoided the northern aspect, which is the lightest (sun sets in the NW and rises in the NE). Roost temperatures did not differ between tree- and barn roosts. Average ambient light intensity on emergence and return was 13.3 lux (SD = 10.1 lux). Roosts in trees and barns shared common physical characteristics, yet despite this both maternity roosts were located in barns, perhaps because such roosts had more space than available tree roosts. Our results suggest that in areas deprived of large trees and extensive old forest, barbastelle shows flexibility in roost selection, although they consistently avoid artificial lights of all kinds. An abundance of potential roosts in trees and buildings and absence of light pollution are therefore key elements in a holistic conservation program for this species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBarbastella barbastellus 3abark 3abarns 3aconservation programs 3aforestry 3aforests 3alandscapes 3alight intensity 3alighting 3apollution 3asummer 3atrees 3aSweden 0aroost characteristics 0aradio-tracking 0alight pollution 0abat conservation1 aKokurewicz, Tomasz S.1 aPetterson, Stefan1 aSánchez-Navarro, Sonia1 aGórska, Monika1 aRydell, Jens0 tActa chiropterologica.g2021 July 9, v. 23, no. 1 p.225-232dMuseum and Institute of Zoology at the Polish Academy of SciencewJournal:2176x1733-53297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3161/15081109ACC2021.23.1.0193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03104naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002600113040001800139100001700157245011400174300001800288520151000306592002801816650001201844650001801856650002801874650002501902650002001927650001501947650001001962650002901972650001102001650001202012650001202024650002202036650001302058650001502071650001302086650001902099650001202118650004002130650002202170650003802192650002302230650002502253650003102278650004102309700001902350700002202369773012302391856003902514852000902553655001202562IND50059075320221118234816.0121011e201206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5005907532DNAL7 a224885922pmid7 a10.1002/etc.18232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Fengjie10aCadmium‐induced changes in trace element bioaccumulation and proteomics perspective in four marine bivalves  ap. 1292-1300.  aBivalves are employed widely as biomonitors of metal pollution and proteomics has increasingly been applied to solve ecotoxicological issues. This study aimed to investigate the effects of Cd exposure on the bioaccumulation of other trace elements and reveal the molecular mechanisms using proteomics technologies. The results showed that Cd exposure resulted in remarkable changes in body concentrations of Zn, Cu, Ag, Co, Ni, Pb, and Se in four marine bivalves (scallop Chlamys nobilis, clam Ruditapes philippinarum, mussel Perna viridis, and oyster Saccostrea cucullata). Generally, the bivalves exposed to higher Cd concentration accumulated higher concentrations of Zn, Cu, and Se, but a lower concentration of Co. The accumulation of Ag, Ni, and Pb was specific for different species. The data strongly suggest that the influences of one metal exposure on the bioaccumulation of other metals/metalloids need to be considered in interpreting body concentrations of the elements in the biomonitors. Cd exposure had little effect on bivalve proteomes, and the identified proteins were insufficient to explain the observed disruption of trace element metabolism. However, protein expression signatures composed of the altered proteins could distinguish the clams and the mussels with different body Cd levels. The strong up‐regulation of galectin in Cd‐exposed oysters indicated the protein as a novel biomarker in environmental monitoring. Environ. Toxicol.

Empirical evidence from Russia  ap. 672-684.  aRussia’s energy-related carbon emission decreased by roughly 30% between 1992 and 2017. Previous studies reported that economic recession led to carbon emission reduction in Russia during 1990s. This paper aims to examine whether the economic recession remains to lead to a decline in Russia’s carbon emission for 1992–2017. The results show that not economic recession, but improving energy efficiency is the most significant contributor to decreasing Russia’s carbon emission from 1992 to 2017. Economic recession is the major contributor to the decrease in Russian carbon emission only before the new century and then reversed to the leading contributor to the increase in carbon emission. This research also finds that a shift to less carbon-intensive fuel and decrease in population also contribute to offsetting carbon emission in Russia. Thus, this research argues that the cause for the decline in Russia’s carbon emission for 1992–2017 is not economic recession. Indeed, Russia’s economic activity and change in carbon emission have been delinked since the new century. It can be concluded that the reduction in Russia’s carbon emission during 1992–2017 arises from a combination of improving energy efficiency, a shift to less carbon-intensive fuel, and decrease in population.  aPublisher supplied data  a18CX04009Bcthe Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities 3acarbon 3aeconomic recession 3aenergy efficiency 3afuels 3aRussia 0aCarbon emission 0aRussia 0aeconomic recession 0aenergy efficiency 0alogarithmic mean Divisia index1 aJiang, Rui0 tEnergy & environment.g2019 June, v. 30, no. 4 p.672-684dSAGE PublicationswJournal:26865x2048-40707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0958305X188027863Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03038naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002800151245010300179300001600282520133600298536022901634592002801863596019001891650001602081650003302097650001802130650001502148650001602163650001402179650001402193650001302207650001802220650002402238653001302262653001702275653003402292653001402326653002402340700001902364773012702383856008502510852000902595655001202604IND60675363420221116141643.0191106e20191002xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067536342DNAL7 a10.1080/09670262.2019.16248322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPapapanagiotou, Georgia10aTaxonomic revision of commercially used Arthrospira (Cyanobacteria) strains: a polyphasic approach  ap. 595-608.  aThe cyanobacterial genus Arthrospira Stizenberger ex Gomont 1892 includes some of the most commercially significant microalgae, commonly known under the taxonomically incorrect brand name ‘Spirulina’. However, the infrageneric classification of the genus is still undefined. Herein, the classification of two Arthrospira strains (Nigrita M1 and Nigrita C1) from a commercial culture installation was studied and a polyphasic meta-analysis approach to a representative number (> 30) of strains was applied, in an attempt to determine the taxonomic relationships among the existing Arthrospira strains. The combined analysis of molecular (16S rRNA, 16S-23S rRNA ITS and cpcBA-IGS sequences) and phenotypic (13 morphological and morphometric characters) data of the studied Arthrospira strains divided them into three clusters/taxa. The main two taxa, namely Taxon I and Taxon II, include planktonic representatives, with irregular and regular helical structure of the filament, respectively. In contrast, Taxon III comprises the benthic representatives of the genus. Arthrospira strains Nigrita M1 and Nigrita C1 fall into Taxon I and II, respectively. The combined phenotypic and phylogenetic analysis suggests classification of Arthrospira strains into three taxa as subspecies of a single species within the genus Arthrospira.  aPart of this work was supported by Aristotle University Research Committee Programme ‘Isolation and diversity of Arthrospira (‘Spirulina’) strains used in commercial cultures’ (Contract No 91771) funded by ALGI AEGE.  aPublisher supplied data  aContract No 91771cAristotle University Research Committee Program “Isolation and diversity of Arthrospira (“Spirulina”) strains used in commercial cultures” funded by ALGI AEGE 3aArthrospira 3ainternal transcribed spacers 3ameta-analysis 3amicroalgae 3amorphometry 3aphenotype 3aphylogeny 3aplankton 3aribosomal RNA 3ataxonomic revisions 0a16S rRNA 0a16S rRNA ITS 0aArthrospira (‘Spirulina’) 0acpcBA-IGS 0apolyphasic taxonomy1 aGkelis, Spyros0 tEuropean journal of phycology.g2019 Oct. 2, v. 54, no. 4 p.595-608dTaylor & FranciswJournal:J000000069x1469-44337nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09670262.2019.16248323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03375naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001800155245014400173500001400317520179700331592002802128650001202156650001502168650001802183650001102201650001902212650001202231650002702243650001302270650002002283650001502303650002202318650000902340650001502349650001502364650002302379653001602402653001702418653001402435653004102449653002702490653002502517700006202542700001802604700002102622700002402643773009102667856009002758852000902848655001202857IND60720529920221117065040.0210219e202103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072052992DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2020.1292942doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZinger, Yaron14aThe effect of intermittent drying and wetting stormwater cycles on the nutrient removal performances of two vegetated biofiltration designs  aNAL-light  aVegetated biofiltration systems (biofilters) are now a well-established technology for treatment of urban stormwater, typically showing high nutrient uptake. However, the impact of high temporal variability of rainfall events (further exacerbated by climate change) on nitrogen and phosphorus removal processes, within different biofiltration designs, is still unknown. Hence, a laboratory-based study was conducted to uncover mechanisms behind nutrient removal in biofilters across different drying and wetting regimes. Two sets of experimental columns were based on (1) the standard biofiltration design (unsaturated zone only), and (2) combination of unsaturated and saturated (submerged) zone (SZ) with additional carbon source. Columns were watered with synthetic stormwater according to three drying and wetting schemes, exploring 1, 2, 3, 4 and 7-week drying. Hydraulic performance, soil moisture and pollutant removal were monitored. The results show that hydraulic conductivity of SZ design experiences less change over time compared to standard design, due to slower media drying, crack formation and lower plant die-off. Varied drying lengths challenged both designs differently, with 2-week drying resulting in significant drop of performance across most pollutants in standard design (except ammonia), while SZ design was able to retain high performance for up to four weeks of drying, sustaining microbial and plant uptake. Increased oxygenation of SZ columns during short-term drying was beneficial for ammonia and phosphorus removal. While SZ design showed better performance and quicker recovery for nitrogen removal, in regions with inter-rain event shorter than two weeks, the standard design (no saturated zone, no carbon source) can achieve similar if not better results.  aPublisher supplied data 3aammonia 3abiofilters 3abiofiltration 3acarbon 3aclimate change 3adie-off 3ahydraulic conductivity 3anitrogen 3anutrient uptake 3aphosphorus 3apollution control 3arain 3asoil water 3astormwater 3atemporal variation 0aRain garden 0aBioretention 0aHydrology 0aAntecedent dry weather period (ADWP) 0aNature-based solutions 0aGreen infrastructure1 aProdanovic, Veljko1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3800-07651 aZhang, Kefeng1 aFletcher, Tim D.1 aDeletic, A.q(Ana),0 tChemosphere.g2021 Mar., v. 267 p.129294-dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2020.1292943Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03060naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001400150245008800164300001400252520176000266592002802026650001402054650001502068650001602083650001302099650000902112650001102121650002202132650001302154650002202167650001902189650002202208653002202230653001202252653001802264653003102282653003202313700005902345700001302404700002302417773008102440856008402521852000902605655001202614IND60561763120221116180140.0170713e20170401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056176312DNAL7 a10.1016/j.watres.2017.01.0312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLu, Qiong10aNitrate reduction and its effects on trichloroethylene degradation by granular iron  ap. 48-57.  aLaboratory column experiments and reactive transport modeling were performed to evaluate the reduction of nitrate and its effects on trichloroethylene (TCE) degradation by granular iron. In addition to determining degradation kinetics of TCE in the presence of nitrate, the columns used in this study were equipped with electrodes which allowed for in situ measurements of corrosion potentials of the iron material. Together with Raman spectroscopic measurements the mechanisms of decline in iron reactivity were examined. The experimental results showed that the presence of nitrate resulted in an increase in corrosion potential and the formation of thermodynamically stable passive films on the iron surface which impaired iron reactivity. The extent of the decline in iron reactivity was proportional to the nitrate concentration. Consequently, significant decreases in TCE and nitrate degradation rates and migration of degradation profiles for both compounds occurred. Furthermore, the TCE degradation kinetics deviated from the pseudo-first-order model. The results of reactive transport modeling, which related the amount of a passivating iron oxide, hematite (α-Fe2O3), to the reactivity of iron, were generally consistent with the patterns of migration of TCE and nitrate profiles observed in the column experiments. More encouragingly, the simulations successfully demonstrated the differences in performances of three columns without changing model parameters other than concentrations of nitrate in the influent. This study could be valuable in the design of iron permeable reactive barriers (PRBs) or in the development of effective maintenance procedures for PRBs treating TCE-contaminated groundwater with elevated nitrate concentrations.  aPublisher supplied data 3acorrosion 3aelectrodes 3agroundwater 3ahematite 3airon 3amodels 3anitrate reduction 3anitrates 3aspectral analysis 3athermodynamics 3atrichloroethylene 0aTrichloroethylene 0aNitrate 0aGranular iron 0aPermeable reactive barrier 0aReactive transport modeling1 aJeen, Sung-Wook1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4686-90461 aGui, Lai1 aGillham, Robert W.0 tWater research.g2017 Apr. 01, v. 112 p.48-57dElsevier Ltdx0043-13547nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2017.01.0313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01198naa a2200253 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245009400157300002000251520033500271592002800606650002300634650002200657650000700679700002700686773013600713856007400849852000900923655001200932IND60661009320221117223334.0190827e20150728xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066100932DNAL7 a10.1039/c5cc03782d2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSon, Jung-Ho12aA new Keggin-like niobium-phosphate cluster that reacts reversibly with hydrogen peroxide  ap. 12744-12747.  aPolyoxoniobate clusters that are stable in acidic solutions are rare and particularly useful in industrial processes.

Here, the environmental range that a species prefers was defined as a niche; a space was defined as an available space if the environmental range of the space matches a niche; and the metric ‘environmental range per unit space (ERUS)' was presented to describe the heterogeneity of localities. Because the spaces with stressful environmental ranges, outside the niche, increased with increasing heterogeneity, available spaces did not continue to indefinitely increase, but the proportion of available spaces in spaces was low at high heterogeneous localities. Consequently, the probability of species occurring in their respective available spaces was unimodal. Due to the presence of large spaces in homogenous localities and more spaces in heterogeneous localities, the interval distances between nonadjacent spaces were large in these localities. Together, the changes in the number and proportion of available spaces and distance between spaces determined the unimodal probability of species dispersing into their respective available spaces. Thus, the probability of species coexisting was unimodal because it is important for coexisting species to grow in their respective available spaces. The probability of population extinction increased with increasing heterogeneity because the available spaces became narrower. In this way, the ERUS strongly influence species richness: a unimodal richness along the heterogeneity gradient occurred in suitable, suboptimal and stressful environments and a unimodal algae richness occurred in a lake and river. These results challenge the viewpoint that richness increases with heterogeneity, providing information about the conservation of richness in very homogeneous and heterogeneous regions, and highlighting the importance of balancing the roles of environment and space in understanding and predicting richness.  aPublisher supplied data 3aextinction 3alakes 3aprobability 3arivers 3aspecies richness1 aGao, Yang1 aMa, Zong Cheng1 aTang, Long1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2485-85090 tEcography.g2021 Aug., v. 44, no. 8 p.1218-1227dBlackwell Publishing LtdwJournal:jnl3867072x0906-75907nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ecog.055803Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02807naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100001300166245007900179300001600258520113900274592002801413650001901441650001901460650001701479650001201496650001301508650002601521650002001547650000901567650001301576650002101589650001401610650002501624650001701649650002401666650002501690650003001715650002001745650003401765650002801799650002501827650002501852650002401877700001601901700001801917700001601935700001901951700001901970700001201989700001402001773012402015856008102139852000902220655001202229IND50085808220221118232307.0150214e201405  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008580822DNAL7 a246193392pmid7 a10.1007/s10295-014-1424-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Ru10aAnaerobic ferrous oxidation by heterotrophic denitrifying enriched culture  ap. 803-809.  aHeterotrophic denitrifying enriched culture (DEC) from a lab-scale high-rate denitrifying reactor was discovered to perform nitrate-dependent anaerobic ferrous oxidation (NAFO). The DEC was systematically investigated to reveal their denitrification activity, their NAFO activity, and the predominant microbial population. The DEC was capable of heterotrophic denitrification with methanol as the electron donor, and autotrophic denitrification with ferrous salt as the electron donor named NAFO. The conversion ratios of ferrous-Fe and nitrate-N were 87.41 and 98.74 %, and the consumption Fe/N ratio was 2.3:1 (mol/mol). The maximum reaction velocity and half saturation constant of Fe were 412.54 mg/(l h) and 8,276.44 mg/l, and the counterparts of N were 20.87 mg/(l h) and 322.58 mg/l, respectively. The predominant bacteria were Hyphomicrobium, Thauera, and Flavobacterium, and the predominant archaea were Methanomethylovorans, Methanohalophilus, and Methanolobus. The discovery of NAFO by heterotrophic DEC is significant for the development of wastewater treatment and the biogeochemical iron cycle and nitrogen cycle.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFlavobacterium 3aHyphomicrobium 3aMethanolobus 3aThauera 3abacteria 3abiogeochemical cycles 3adenitrification 3airon 3amethanol 3anitrate nitrogen 3aoxidation 3awastewater treatment 2aAnaerobiosis 2aArchaeaxmetabolism 2aBacteriaxmetabolism 2aBioreactorsxmicrobiology 2aDenitrification 2aFerrous Compoundsxmetabolism 2aHeterotrophic Processes 2aMethanolxmetabolism 2aNitratesxmetabolism 2aOxidation-Reduction1 aZheng, Ping1 aXing, Ya-Juan1 aZhang, Meng1 aAbbas, Ghulam,1 aZhao, Zhi-qing1 aLi, Wei1 aWang, Lan0 tJournal of industrial microbiology & biotechnology.g2014 May, v. 41, no. 5 p.803-809dSpringer-Verlagx1367-54357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10295-014-1424-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03141naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100005800146245006800204300001600272520169500288592002801983650001202011650001102023650001202034650002302046650001302069650002902082650002102111650001502132650001702147650002202164650001702186650002202203650002302225651002102248653003502269653002102304653003302325653002902358700001802387700001602405700001802421700001902439773011202458856008002570852000902650655001202659IND60645711320221119162555.0190529e201906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064571132DNAL7 a10.1177/0958305X188029092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKang, Seongmin1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8628-824110aApplication of biomass fraction at industrial waste incinerator  ap. 707-718.  aThe factor required for estimating greenhouse gas emission, i.e. the fossil carbon fraction, excludes the biomass fraction of incinerated waste and can be applied as a major factor in estimating greenhouse gas emissions. In Korea, the amount of greenhouse gases emitted from waste incineration facilities is calculated by using a solid waste incinerated amount default values (biomass fraction, content of dry matter, etc.) provided by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Chang (IPCC). However, this method cannot reflect the characteristics of Korea. This method is likely to overestimate or underestimate the amount of greenhouse gas emissions. This study aims to investigate the difference in emissions between the actual values of the biomass content based on the exhaust gas standard and the IPCC defaults applied in the calculation of the national emissions. The comparative result indicates that the amount of greenhouse gas emissions calculated using the solid waste composition method is 70.71 tons CO₂/day and using the flue gas analysis is 56.92 tons CO₂/day. This verifies that the former method overestimates the amount of greenhouse gas emissions compared with the latter method. The difference is caused by applying both factors in estimating greenhouse gas emissions and the basic values provided in the IPCC guideline. In addition, although the IPCC reported 10% of biomass content, it is 41.06% as a result of actual analysis, and hence, it is considered that there will be a difference depending on the biomass content. Thus, to increase the reliability of the calculated greenhouse gas emissions, these should be estimated by considering national characteristics.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiomass 3acarbon 3aclimate 3adry matter content 3aflue gas 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3agreenhouse gases 3aguidelines 3aincinerators 3aindustrial wastes 3asolid wastes 3awaste composition 3awaste incineration 3aKorean Peninsula 0aGreenhouse gas estimate method 0abiomass fraction 0aindustrial waste incinerator 0agreenhouse gas emissions1 aKim, Seungjin1 aSong, Garam1 aKim, Ki Hyun,1 aJeon, Eui-Chan0 tEnergy & environment.g2019 June, v. 30, no. 4 p.707-718dSAGE PublicationswJournal:26865x2048-40707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0958305X188029093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle
