We propose a molecular basis for the marked extensibility and negative compressibility of fibrin gels based on the structural and mechanical properties of clots at the network, fiber, and molecular levels. The force required to stretch a clot initially rises linearly and is accompanied by a dramatic decrease in clot volume and a peak in compressibility. These macroscopic transitions are accompanied by fiber alignment and bundling after forced protein unfolding. Constitutive models are developed to integrate observations at spatial scales that span six orders of magnitude and indicate that gel extensibility and expulsion of water are both manifestations of protein unfolding, which is not apparent in other matrix proteins such as collagen.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3ablood coagulation 3acollagen 3acompressibility 3aextensibility 3afibrin 3agels 3amechanical properties 3amodels 3apolymers 3aprotein unfolding1 aLitvinov, Rustem I.1 aDischer, Dennis E.1 aPurohit, Prashant K.1 aWeisel, John W.0 tScience.g2009 Aug. 7, v. 325, no. 5941 p.741-744dAmerican Association for the Advancement of Sciencex0036-80757nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.11724843Available from publisher's Web site  a20090808b00000000c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02305naa a2200481 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024001800097040001800115100002800133245004500161300001600206300002400222500004900246520101100295650001801306650002401324650001301348650002301361650001101384650001501395650001001410650001601420650000901436650002101445650002901466650001101495650001101506650000901517650001601526650003201542650001601574650002701590651001501617651001501632773010101647852000901748939003301757945000801790946001301798655001201811991565543800742620221119171115.0850201s1983    xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI850066082DNAL7 a66673672pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMiguez L., Hugo Adolfo.10aAlcohol consumption levels in Costa Rica  ap. 396-406.  ap. 396-406. charts.  aMost of the references cited are in Spanish.  aA survey comprising 20% of the cantons of the Costa Rican provinces was conducted to determine the extent of alcohol consumption; the information was used to assess drinking patterns within the country as a whole. Male subjects were far more likely to have drinking problems than their female counterparts, particularly among unskilled workers and those with little or no formal education. Drinking among women was more common in persons under 45 years of age, especially those with a university education and jobs, than it was among older women. Beer was reported by the heavy drinkers as the beverage choice, although rum was consumed by significant numbers; wine-drinking was rare. Some 5% of all Costa Rican adults over 14 years of age were alcoholics, while another 10% could be classified as "excessive" drinkers. Many who had formerly been heavy drinkers reported their abstinence had resulted from health problems, religious prohibitions on drinking, or participation in Alcoholics Anonymous.

A semiselective medium comprised of corn meal agar, ampicillin (100 microgram/ml), dichloran (10 microgram/ml), and rose bengal (20 microgram/ml), was developed to enhance recovery of Tilletiopsis isolates from nature. Among a total of 143 isolates, four species--T. washingtonensis, T. minor, T. pallescens, and T. albescens--were recovered in decreasing frequencies. Two isolates, one of T. pallescens and one of T. washingtonensis, were evaluated for their growth response to environmental factors and efficacy in reducing powdery mildew growth and sporulation. Growth of the isolates on agar medium was similar at 15-30 C but was significantly (P = 0.05) reduced at 3 C; optimal growth and spore production in broth occurred at 15-25 C, and growth was nil at 30-35 C. Ballistospores germinated over the pH range of 3.8 to 7.9. Reducing the osmotic potential in liquid culture with PEG 8000 from -0.5 to -2.0 MPa resulted in decreased biomass and blastospore production along with a change in growth from blastospore production to mycelium production. Among several culture media that were compared in this study, optimal blastospore production occurred on 2.5% D-glucose, 1.0% peptone, and 0.1% yeast extract. When a blastospore suspension containing 1 X 10(8) cells permilliliter was applied to the surface of cucumber leaves under conditions of 85% relative humidity and 25 C, the yeast could be recovered from leaf washings over a 4- to 5-wk period. Applications of T. pallescens or T. washingtonensis to naturally infected greenhouse cucumber plants during 1991, three times at weekly intervals reduced the mildew conidia density significantly (P = 0.0001) when compared to a diluted broth control. In two subsequent trials, Tilletiopsis treatments significantly (P less than or equal to 0.05) reduced mildew sporulation and hyphal growth when compared to the control. Mildew hyphae after Tilletiopsis treatment were shrunken and collapsed when viewed under the scanning electron microscope, and the conidiophores had fewer spores. Growth of Tilletiopsis occurred on laminarin as a sole carbon source in vitro but there was no growth on chitin. Activity of beta-1,3 glucanase was detected and could be one of the potential modes of action of this biological control agent against powdery mildew. 3aviability 3aPodosphaera xanthii 3aplant diseases and disorders 3asporulation 3aconidia 3aCucumis sativus 3ayeasts 3aultrastructure 3adisease control 3aplant pathogenic fungi 3atemperature 3aculture media 3aleaves 3abiological control 3aBritish Columbia 0atilletiopsis albescens 0atilletiopsis pallescens 0aSphaerotheca fuliginea 0agrowth 0atilletiopsis washingtonensis 0atilletiopsis minor 0aspores 0aisolation1 aMenzies, J.G.1 aPunja, Z.K.0 tPhytopathology.g1994 Apr., v. 84, no. 4 p.341-351x0031-949X7nnas  aDNAL  a19950303b19950309c00000000  aINDdMKS  aOther US 7aarticle03271naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003100092040001800123100001700141245007800158300001800236520195800254650002502212650002102237650002502258650001402283650002302297650001802320650002202338650001702360650001302377650001902390650002102409650001302430650001302443700002102456700002202477700001702499700001802516700001902534700001802553700002302571773007302594852000902667856008102676930003302757946001102790655001202801IND4424327120221119165112.0090807e200909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442432712DNAL7 a10.1093/glycob/cwp0832doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShida, Kyoko10aUnusual accumulation of sulfated glycosphingolipids in colon cancer cells  ap. 1018-1033.  aThe structures of glycosphingolipids from highly purified colorectal cancer cells and normal colorectal epithelial cells of 16 patients have been analyzed in fine detail (Misonou Y, Shida K, Korekane H, Seki Y, Noura S, Ohue M, Miyamoto Y. 2009. Comprehensive Clinico-Glycomic Study of 16 Colorectal Cancer Specimens: Elucidation of aberrant glycosylation and ts mechanistic causes in colorectal cancer cells. J Proteome Res. 8:2990-3005). Further structural analyses demonstrated that colon cancer cells from two patients accumulated unusual glycosphingolipids which were not observed in either colorectal cancer cells or normal colorectal epithelial cells from the other patients. Mass spectrometry analyses revealed that the unusual structures include sulfated oligosaccharides. The structures of the glycosphingolipids of the cancer cells from these two cases were analyzed by methods which include enzymatic release of carbohydrate moieties, fluorescent labeling with aminopyridine and identification using two-dimensional mapping, enzymatic digestion and mass spectrometry together with methanolysis, and the use of newly synthesized sulfo-fucosylated oligosaccharides as standards. The colon cancer cells from one of the patients demonstrate a variety of oligosaccharides as major components which are sulfated at the C6 position of subterminal GlcNAc and at C3 positions of terminal galactose with or without sialylation or fucosylation. These include 6-sulfo Lex, 6'-sialyl 6-sulfo lactosamine, and 3'-sialyl 6-sulfo Lex, in addition to sialylated or fucosylated derivatives of type-1 and type-2 hybrid oligosaccharides. The colon cancer cells from the other patient have two kinds of sulfated oligosaccharides, a 6-sulfo Lex structure and a 3'-sulfo Lex structure, as minor components. Taking into consideration the clinical features of the two patients, the biological significance of sulfated glycosphingolipids on cancer cells is discussed. 3acolorectal neoplasms 3aepithelial cells 3afluorescent labeling 3agalactose 3aglycosphingolipids 3aglycosylation 3amass spectrometry 3amethanolysis 3amoieties 3aneoplasm cells 3aoligosaccharides 3apatients 3aproteome1 aMisonou, Yoshiko1 aKorekane, Hiroaki1 aSeki, Yosuke1 aNoura, Shingo1 aOhue, Masayuki1 aHonke, Koichi1 aMiyamoto, Yasuhide0 tGlycobiology.g2009 Sept., v. 19, no. 9 p.1018-1033x0959-66587nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/glycob/cwp0833Available from publisher's Web site  a20090808b00000000c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02638naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003100092040001800123100001400141245011600155300001800271500002400289520133900313650001901652650000901671650001201680650001201692650002401704650002101728650001601749650001601765650003101781650001601812650000901828650001401837650002401851650002101875650001401896650001201910650001401922650001301936650001301949651001001962700001701972773008901989852000902078856008102087655001202168IND4464006520221119165156.0120904s2003    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446400652DNAL7 a10.1081/PLN-1200232882doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aColla, G.10aApplication of Systematic Variation Method for Optimizing Mineral Nutrition of Soilless‚ÄêGrown Zucchini Squash  ap. 1859-1872.  aIncludes references  aZucchini plants (Cucurbita pepo L.) were grown in perlite bags under greenhouse conditions in 2000 and 2001 at Viterbo Experimental Farm, Central Italy. In a 2000 greenhouse experiment, treatments were six formulations with different ratios of NO3 -, SO4 2-, PO4 3-, K+, Ca2+, and Mg2+ √ó two total nutrient levels (0.5 and 1 eq plant-1). An unfertilized treatment was also tested. Each nutrient ratio treatment was defined by a high proportion of one nutrient and a low proportion of other ions of equal charge with the same anion:cation ratio and total concentration. The 2000 data of fruit yield and total dry weight biomass were used to calibrate the mathematical model (according to the systematic variation method) relating fruit yield and total dry weight biomass to nutrient proportions and total nutrient levels of the fertilizer and total nutrition. For both fruit yield and total plant biomass, the optimal proportions of macronutrients in the fertilizer and total nutrition were largely composed by NO3 -, K+, Ca2+, and Mg2+ (average 82% of total macronutrients), while the mean optimal total concentration was 2.89 eq plant-1. A verification of the calibrated model against 2001 experimental data showed that the model was able to predict fruit yield and total plant biomass by varying nutrient composition of the medium. 3aCucurbita pepo 3abags 3abiomass 3acalcium 3ademonstration farms 3afertilizer rates 3afertilizers 3afruit yield 3agreenhouse experimentation 3agreenhouses 3aions 3amagnesium 3amathematical models 3anutrient content 3anutrition 3aperlite 3apotassium 3asulfates 3azucchini 3aItaly1 aSaccardo, F.0 tJournal of plant nutrition.g2003, v. 26, no. 9 p.1859-1872dDekkerx0190-41677nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1081/PLN-1200232883Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03489naa a2200625 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004000092040001800132100001800150245010200168300001400270500016800284500002400452520159900476650001302075650002302088650001202111650001102123650001302134650002202147650001302169650002102182650001302203650002302216650002102239650000902260650001002269650001902279650001502298650001202313650002202325650001102347650001402358650001002372650001602382650001002398650001502408650001602423650001702439650001202456650001402468650002202482650001902504651001502523700002102538700001802559700001802577700002002595773013702615852000902752856009002761655001202851IND4463990320221119165320.0120829s2012    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446399032DNAL7 a10.17660/ActaHortic.2012.948.22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMaghradze, D.10aImportance, usage and prospective of CWR for fruits, grapevine and nuts in Georgia and Azerbaijan  ap. 33-40.  aPaper presented at the First International Symposium on Wild Relatives of Subtropical and Temperate Fruit and Nut Crops, held March 19-23, 2011, Davis, California.  aIncludes references  aThe South Caucasus considered being primary or secondary center of origin, domestication and diversity of many fruits, grapevine and nuts taking their basis from the CWR of the region.

Except fruit utilization the WR are operate as rootstocks and for live fences; they are honey, decorative and medical plants, suitable for making anti-erosion and wind-brake line plantations, forest garden construction. The CWR in Georgia and Azerbaijan are conserved in protected areas and botanical gardens, while ex situ and on-farm conservation are limited in spite that some species are included in the local "Red Books" or "Red Lists". There are few projects increasing the importance of CWR here. Including in the global databases, in applied research and breeding programs can enlarge public awareness of CWR, promoting traditional ways for their usage. 3aCastanea 3aMespilus germanica 3aalmonds 3aapples 3aapricots 3abotanical gardens 3abreeding 3acenter of origin 3acherries 3aconservation areas 3adomestic animals 3afigs 3aflora 3afood additives 3afood chain 3aforests 3afruit consumption 3afruits 3ahazelnuts 3ahoney 3alive fences 3apears 3apistachios 3aplantations 3apomegranates 3aquinces 3araw fruit 3atraditional foods 3awild relatives 3aAzerbaijan1 aBobokashvili, Z.1 aAkparov, Z.I.1 aMusayev, M.K.1 aMƒÉmmƒÉdov, A.,0 tActa horticulturae.g2012 May, , no. 948 p.33-40dInternational Society for Horticultural SciencewJournal:jnl46289x0567-75727nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.17660/ActaHortic.2012.948.23Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02018naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092040001800125100002100143245009800164300001800262520097600280650001501256650002201271650001101293650001101304650001201315650001801327650002001345700002301365700002601388773012801414852000901542856008301551930003301634946001301667655001201680IND4410688420221119165405.0080926e20080926xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441068842DNAL7 a10.1126/science.11615112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBragg, Arthur E.10aLinear Response Breakdown in Solvation Dynamics Induced by Atomic Electron-Transfer Reactions  ap. 1817-1822.  aThe linear response (LR) approximation, which predicts identical relaxation rates from all nonequilibrium initial conditions that relax to the same equilibrium state, underlies dominant models of how solvation influences chemical reactivity. We experimentally tested the validity of LR for the solvation that accompanies partial electron transfer to and from a monatomic solute in solution. We photochemically prepared the species with stoichiometry Na‚Å∞ in liquid tetrahydrofuran by both adding an electron to Na‚Å∫ and removing an electron from Na‚Åª. Because atoms lack nuclear degrees of freedom, ultrafast changes in the Na‚Å∞ absorption spectrum reflected the solvation that began from our two initial nonequilibrium conditions. We found that the solvation of Na‚Å∞ occurs more rapidly from Na‚Å∫ than Na‚Åª, constituting a breakdown of LR. This indicates that Marcus theory would fail to describe electron-transfer processes for this and related chemical systems. 3aabsorption 3aelectron transfer 3amodels 3asodium 3asolutes 3astoichiometry 3atetrahydrofuran1 aCavanagh, Molly C.1 aSchwartz, Benjamin J.0 tScience.g2008 Sept. 26, v. 321, no. 5897 p.1817-1822dAmerican Association for the Advancement of Sciencex0036-80757nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.11615113Available from publisher's Web site  a20080926b20081011c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03648naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003600092040001800128072001700146072001700163072001700180100001100197245013200208300001600340500001500356520212600371650002102497650000902518650002002527650002902547650002302576650001302599650001702612650001702629650002302646650003102669650001802700650001302718650002102731650001802752651001002770653001702780653002102797700001302818700001402831700001102845773009802856852000902954856008602963930003303049945002503082946001103107655001203118IND4399087520221119165424.0071217e200801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439908752DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agee.2007.05.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aYi, Z.10aExchange of carbonyl sulfide (OCS) and dimethyl sulfide (DMS) between rice paddy fields and the atmosphere in subtropical China  ap. 116-124.  a2019-12-06  aCarbonyl sulfide (OCS) and dimethyl sulfide (DMS) are important trace gases contributing to sulfate aerosol formation in the lower and upper atmosphere and hence greatly impacting global radiative balance. In the present study the exchange of OCS and DMS between rice (Oryza sativa L.) paddy fields and the atmosphere was studied in subtropical China from November 2004 to July 2005. OCS and DMS fluxes were compared between the planted and non-planted paddy fields, and between dry and waterlogged soils. The rice paddy fields were found to be a net sink for OCS and a source for DMS, with an uptake rate of 12.1 ¬± 16.0 pmol m-2 s-1 for OCS and an emission rate of 25.9 ¬± 35.2 pmol m-2 s-1 for DMS. OCS fluxes varied significantly between non-planted dry and waterlogged soils, with an uptake rate of 11.4 ¬± 7.1 pmol m-2 s-1 for non-planted dry soils and an emission rate of 9.0 ¬± 5.4 pmol m-2 s-1 for non-planted waterlogged soils. For DMS the variation between non-planted dry and waterlogged soils was not significant. Both OCS and DMS fluxes showed significant differences between the planted and non-planted waterlogged soils. For OCS, the planted waterlogged soil acted as a sink with an uptake rate of 29.0 ¬± 25.7 pmol m-2, but the non-planted waterlogged soil acted as a source with an emission rate of 9.0 ¬± 5.4 pmol m-2 s-1. For DMS, both the planted and non-planted waterlogged soils acted as sources, with an emission rate of 51.2 ¬± 37.5 pmol m-2 s-1 for the planted waterlogged soil, which was significantly higher than that for the non-planted waterlogged soil (3.8 ¬± 2.8 pmol m-2 s-1). OCS and DMS exchange rates differed significantly at different rice growth stages, with the highest fluxes at the jointing-booting stage. The potential factors causing the variations between the different treatments are also discussed. This work revealed that rice paddy field in subtropical China acts as a sink for OCS and an emission source for DMS as a whole and further investigation on the influence of soil microorganisms and soil redox potential on the OCS and DMS fluxes in rice paddy field are needed. 3agreenhouse gases 3arice 3aredox potential 3asoil chemical properties 3asoil water content 3asulfates 3aOryza sativa 3agas exchange 3aflooded conditions 3asoil biological properties 3agas emissions 3asulfides 3acarbonyl sulfide 3aair pollution 3aChina 0asoil biology 0adimethyl sulfide1 aWang, X.1 aSheng, G.1 aFu, J.0 tAgriculture, ecosystems & environment.g2008 Jan., v. 123, no. 1-3 p.116-124x0167-88097nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agee.2007.05.0113Available from publisher's Web site  a20080318b20080404c00000000  aINDd2CTe2008/02/25  aNon-US 7aarticle02353naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001800145245012600163300001600289520123100305650001501536650001601551650001701567650001601584650001901600650001201619650001701631650001301648650002101661650001101682650001801693700002401711773010601735852000901841856008501850939003301935946001101968655001201979IND4457590520221119165450.0110506e201106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445759052DNAL7 a10.1007/s10532-010-9424-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSah, Shivjee 10a1-Naphthol 2-hydroxylase from Pseudomonas sp. strain C6: purification, characterization and chemical modification studies  ap. 517-526.  a1-Naphthol 2-hydroxylase (1-NH) which catalyzes the conversion of 1-naphthol to 1,2-dihydroxynaphthalene was purified to homogeneity from carbaryl-degrading Pseudomonas sp. strain C6. The enzyme was found to be a homodimer with subunit molecular weight of 66 kDa. UV, visible and fluorescence spectral properties, identification of flavin moiety by HPLC as FAD, and reconstitution of apoenzyme by FAD suggest that enzyme is FAD-dependent. 1-NH accepts electron from NADH as well as NADPH. Besides 1-naphthol (K m, 9.1 ŒºM), the enzyme also accepts 5-amino 1-naphthol (K m, 6.4 ŒºM) and 4-chloro 1-naphthol (K m, 2.3 ŒºM) as substrates. Enzyme showed substrate inhibition phenomenon at high concentration of 1-naphthol (K i, 283 ŒºM). Stoichiometric consumption of oxygen and NADH, and biochemical properties suggest that 1-NH belongs to FAD containing external flavomonooxygenase group of oxido-reductase class of enzymes. Based on biochemical and kinetic properties, 1-NH from Pseudomonas sp. strain C6 appears to be different than that reported earlier from Pseudomonas sp. strain C4. Chemical modification and protection by 1-naphthol and NADH suggest that His, Arg, Cys, Tyr and Trp are at or near the active site of 1-NH. 3a1-naphthol 3aPseudomonas 3aactive sites 3aapoproteins 3abiodegradation 3aenzymes 3afluorescence 3amoieties 3amolecular weight 3aoxygen 3astoichiometry1 aPhale, Prashant S. 0 tBiodegradation.g2011 June, v. 22, no. 3 p.517-526dDordrecht : Springer Netherlandsx0923-98207nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10532-010-9424-23Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b00000000c20110507  aNon-US 7aarticle03165naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003600111040001800147072000900165072000900174072000900183100001500192245012600207300001600333500002400349520148700373650002101860650001201881650001901893650001701912650002501929650002901954650001201983650002201995650001802017650001102035650002102046650002602067650001202093650001102105650000902116650006102125650004002186650006002226653002502286700001802311700001802329773011602347852000902463856007002472930003302542945002502575946001102600655001202611IND4380494320221119164942.0060526e200605  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438049432DNAL7 a166511872pmid7 a10.1016/j.ibmb.2006.02.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF851 0aL600 0aL0011 aMangat, J.10aIn vitro assay for sex pheromone biosynthesis by the female yellow mealworm beetle and identification of a regulated step  ap. 403-409.  aIncludes references  aSeveral pheromones are known to be involved in mediating the mating behavior of the yellow mealworm beetle, Tenebrio molitor (Coleoptera: Tenebrionidae). The only sex pheromone that has been identified to date in this species is the female-produced male attractant, 4-methylnonanol (MNol). The objective of this study was to develop an in vitro assay for the last biosynthetic step involved in MNol biosynthesis, the reduction of 4-methylnonanoic acid (MNA) to the corresponding pheromone product. In vitro assays were conducted by adding appropriate cofactors and radioactively labelled precursor. Radioactive pheromone product was separated from the radioactive precursor by column chromatography, and quantified through scintillation counting. The conversion of MNA to MNol was observed, and was comparable to that observed in vivo using the same radiolabelled substrate. In both the in vivo and in vitro assays, the 3H-MNA was also converted to a nonpolar product, tentatively identified as a triacylglyerol (TAG) derivative. The reduction of 3H-MNA to pheromone proceeded through the coenzyme A intermediate. Mature females reduced significantly more precursor to pheromone than the immature females and the males, both in vivo and in vitro, indicating that the reduction of MNA to MNol is a regulated step involved in pheromone production. Using the in vitro assay reported herein, studies are ongoing in our lab to purify and characterize the enzyme catalyzing the reduction. 3aTenebrio molitor 3afemales 3asex pheromones 3abiosynthesis 3abiochemical pathways 3aphysiological regulation 3aenzymes 3aacetyl coenzyme A 3aradiolabeling 3aassays 3ain vitro studies 2aAllosteric Regulation 2aAnimals 2aFemale 2aMale 2aSex Attractantsxbiosynthesisxisolation & purification. 2aSexual Behavior, Animalxphysiology 2aTenebrioxenzymologyxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 0aacetyl-coA reductase1 aLangedock, C.1 aVanderwel, D.0 tInsect biochemistry and molecular biology.g2006 May, v. 36, no. 5 p.403-409dElsevier Sciencex0965-17487nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ibmb.2006.02.0033electronic resource  a20060619b20060702c00000000  aINDdNZMe2006/06/14  aNon-US 7aarticle03387naa a2200625 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003600111040001800147072000900165072000900174072000900183100001400192245013000206300001600336500002400352500001500376520133700391650004501728650002201773650002501795650002301820650001601843650002501859650002501884650001701909650002701926650002401953650001901977650004801996650004402044650002802088650003102116650003002147650003702177650003102214650001902245650003002264650004602294650005302340653003402393653001302427700001702440700001302457700001502470773011602485852000902601856007002610930003302680945002502713946001102738655001202749IND4380494220221119165023.0060526e200605  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438049422DNAL7 a166511862pmid7 a10.1016/j.ibmb.2006.02.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF821 0aL200 0aL0011 aHsu, J.C.10aMutations in the acetylcholinesterase gene of Bactrocera dorsalis associated with resistance to organophosphorus insecticides  ap. 396-402.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aMutations in the gene encoding the enzyme acetylcholinesterase (AChE) of the oriental fruit fly, Bactrocera dorsalis, associated with resistance to an organophosphorus insecticide have been characterized. Three point mutations producing nonsynonymous changes in the predicted amino acid sequence of the product of the B. dorsalis ace gene in resistant vs. susceptible flies have been identified. One of these changes is unique to B. dorsalis while the other two occur at sites that are identical to mutations previously described for another Bactrocera species. Although the precise role of the third mutation is not clearly established, the independent origin of two identical alterations in these two species strongly supports the idea proposed previously that molecular changes associated with insecticide resistance in key genes and enzymes such as AChE are largely constrained to a limited number of sites. The results obtained here also suggest that the widespread use of organophosphorus insecticides will likely lead to a predictable acquisition of resistance in wild populations of B. dorsalis as well as other pest species. For surveys of B. dorsalis populations that may develop resistance, diagnostic tests using PCR-RFLP based methods for detecting the presence of all three mutations in individual flies are described. 3arestriction fragment length polymorphism 3asequence analysis 3aacetylcholinesterase 3agenetic resistance 3afruit flies 3aamino acid sequences 3anucleotide sequences 3afenitrothion 3ainsecticide resistance 3aBactrocera dorsalis 3apoint mutation 2aAcetylcholinesterasexgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aCholinesterase Inhibitorsxpharmacology 2aDNA Mutational Analysis 2aFenitrothionxpharmacology 2aInsect Proteinsxgenetics 2aInsecticide Resistancexgenetics 2aInsecticidesxpharmacology 2aPoint Mutation 2aPolymerase Chain Reaction 2aPolymorphism, Restriction Fragment Length 2aTephritidaexdrug effectsxenzymologyxgenetics. 0aorganophosphorus insecticides 0aace gene1 aHaymer, D.S.1 aWu, W.J.1 aFeng, H.T.0 tInsect biochemistry and molecular biology.g2006 May, v. 36, no. 5 p.396-402dElsevier Sciencex0965-17487nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ibmb.2006.02.0023electronic resource  a20060619b20060702c00000000  aINDdNZMe2006/06/14  aNon-US 7aarticle03150naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002200145245011500167300001600282520168200298650002801980650000802008650001902016650002302035650001602058650001902074650001102093650001902104650003002123650002102153650001202174650001402186650001102200650000702211650001102218650002002229650002502249650002502274650001802299650001302317700002302330700002702353700002002380773010602400852000902506856008502515939003302600946001102633655001202644IND4457590120221119165016.0110506e201106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445759012DNAL7 a10.1007/s10532-010-9420-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChristen, Pierre 10aPhenol biodegradation by the thermoacidophilic archaeon Sulfolobus solfataricus 98/2 in a fed-batch bioreactor  ap. 475-484.  aToxic at low concentrations, phenol is one of the most common organic pollutants in air and water.

After a short lag-phase, only glucose was consumed. Phenol degradation then began while glucose was still present in the reactor. When glucose was exhausted, phenol was used for respiration and then for biomass build-up. After several batch runs (phenol < 365 mg l‚Åª¬π), specific growth rate (ŒºX) was 0.034 ¬± 0.001 h‚Åª¬π, specific phenol degradation rate (qP) was 57.5 ¬± 2 mg g‚Åª¬π h‚Åª¬π, biomass yield (YX/P) was 52.2 ¬± 1.1 g mol‚Åª¬π, and oxygen yield factor [graphic removed] was 9.2 ¬± 0.2 g mol‚Åª¬π. A carbon recovery close to 100% suggested that phenol was exclusively transformed into biomass (35%) and CO‚ÇÇ (65%). Molar phenol oxidation constant [graphic removed] was calculated from stoichiometry of phenol oxidation and introducing experimental biomass and CO‚ÇÇ conversion yields on phenol, leading to values varying between 4.78 and 5.22 mol mol‚Åª¬π. Respiratory quotient was about 0.84 mol mol‚Åª¬π, very close to theoretical value (0.87 mol mol‚Åª¬π). Carbon dioxide production, oxygen demand and redox potential, monitored on-line, were good indicators of growth, substrate consumption and exhaustion, and can therefore be usefully employed for industrial phenol bioremediation in extreme environments. 3aSulfolobus solfataricus 3aair 3abiodegradation 3abiomass production 3abioreactors 3abioremediation 3acarbon 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbon dioxide production 3adissolved oxygen 3aglucose 3aoxidation 3aoxygen 3apH 3aphenol 3aredox potential 3arespiratory quotient 3aspecific growth rate 3astoichiometry 3atoxicity1 aDavidson, Sylvain 1 aCombet-Blanc, Yannick 1 aAuria, Richard 0 tBiodegradation.g2011 June, v. 22, no. 3 p.475-484dDordrecht : Springer Netherlandsx0923-98207nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10532-010-9420-63Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b00000000c20110507  aNon-US 7aarticle02016naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001700152245007500169300001600244500019700260500002400457520076700481650001301248650002001261650001601281650001501297650002301312650001901335700002001354700001801374700001501392700001801407773014001425852000901565856009201574655001201666IND4463988620221119165134.0120828s2012    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446398862DNAL7 a10.17660/ActaHortic.2012.952.1192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGravalos, I.12aA low-cost greenhouse monitoring system based on internet connectivity  ap. 937-943.  aPaper presented at the International Symposium on Advanced Technologies and Management towards Sustainable Greenhouse Ecosystems - GreenSys2011, volume 2, held June 5-10, 2011, Athens, Greece.  aIncludes references  aGreenhouse Automation Networks (GANs) are an essential part of modern greenhouse operation and are aimed to increase the production efficiency.

  1 aJackson, R.D.10aAssessing ecosystem variance at different scales to generalize about pasture management in southern Wisconsin  ap. 471-478.  aPasture-based agroecosystems are an expanding enterprise in the northcentral U.S., but their structure and function have received little attention. We implemented a manipulative experiment to test pasture management effects on several agroecosystem variables at a university research farm in southcentral Wisconsin. In concert, we established a mensurative experiment across eight grass-based farms in the same region where we measured the same variables under existing land uses. Here we describe how total and relative variation in greenhouse gas fluxes, ground cover, soil arthropods, and soil inorganic N were distributed across nested spatial scales, management treatments, and unexplained realms of these systems. This approach seeks to improve our understanding of pasture management effects on agroecosystem stocks and fluxes, while expanding our inferential space to a wider geographical area. Greenhouse gas fluxes (CH4 and N2O) were an order-of-magnitude more variable than soil N pools, ground cover, or arthropod abundances. Most of the variance in these fluxes was at the subsample level, indicating the need for either more sampling chambers per management treatment or an efficient stratification scheme or both. Methane was more variable farm-to-farm than among management treatments within farms, while N2O showed the opposite pattern indicating that farmers are likely to have more influence on N2O fluxes via management than they can have on CH4 fluxes. Variability in arthropod groups and ground cover was rather uniformly distributed across nested spatial scales, with the exception of beetles and harvestmen, which displayed little subsample variability. Soil inorganic N pools were more variable from farm-to-farm than among management treatments, but most variation was at the subsample level. The least variable response was from the greenhouse gas CO2, which is driven by both auto- and hetero-trophic organisms. Calculation of total and relativized coefficients of variation allowed for a standardized comparison of agroecosystem variables possessing disparate units of measure and facilitated conclusions about the generality of results across a broader geographical area than just a single farm. 3apastures 3apasture management 3aagroecosystems 3aspatial variation 3ageographical variation 3aenvironmental factors 3afield experimentation 3aland use 3agreenhouse gases 3agas emissions 3avegetation cover 3asoil arthropods 3asoil fertility 3anitrogen 3amethane 3anitrous oxide 3aspecies diversity 3asoil microorganisms 3amicrobial activity 3aWisconsin1 aBell, M.M.1 aGratton, C.0 tAgriculture, ecosystems & environment.g2007 Dec., v. 122, no. 4 p.471-478x0167-88097nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agee.2007.03.0043Available from publisher's Web site  a20080110b20080202c00000000  aINDd2CTe2007/12/06  aNon-US 7aarticle03029naa a2200697 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111072001700129072001700146100002500163245010700188300001800295500001500313520106200328650001601390650002101406650001401427650002001441650002801461650002701489650001701516650002001533650002301553650001701576650001201593650001101605650003001616650001601646650001501662650001901677650001401696650002201710650001401732650001201746650004101758650001301799650003301812650002701845650001101872650003901883650002601922650003101948650003201979650002302011650002402034650001202058651001202070653001402082700001902096700001702115700002002132773008702152852000902239930003302248945002502281946001302306655001202319IND4413805720221119165143.0081215e200812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441380572DNAL7 a192449102pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

As with the genus Campylobacter, Arcobacter is found responsible for human gastrointestinal infection, and it is assumed to originate from poultry meat sources. Samples from poultry slaughtering originating from a broiler slaughterhouse and a turkey slaughterhouse were analyzed for Arcobacter. Five broiler flocks and five turkey flocks were analyzed in the course of slaughtering and processing for the prevalence of Arcobacter. The prevalence in broilers was 43.0%, while turkey samples were contaminated with 18.2% of positive samples. The numbers of Arcobacter present on turkey skin samples ranged between 1.7 and 2.4 log CFU/cm2. The prevalence changes during processing showed an increase after chilling in broilers, whereas there was a constant decrease in turkey processing. Species identification showed that all three Arcobacter spp. of relevance in human infection could be isolated, with A. butzleri being found at higher prevalence, which was followed by A. skirrowii and A. cryaerophilus. 3aturkey meat 3abroiler chickens 3aslaughter 3aslaughterhouses 3abacterial contamination 3aGram-negative bacteria 3achicken skin 3ameat processing 3apoultry production 3achicken meat 3aturkeys 3aflocks 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aplate count 3aArcobacter 3afood pathogens 3aincidence 3achicken carcasses 2aAbattoirs 2aAnimals 2aArcobacterxisolation & purification 2aChickens 2aFood Contaminationxanalysis 2aFood Handlingxmethods 2aHumans 2aPolymerase Chain Reactionxmethods 2aPoultryxmicrobiology 2aReproducibility of Results 2aSensitivity and Specificity 2aSkinxmicrobiology 2aSpecies Specificity 2aTurkeys 3aGermany 0aisolation1 aKessen, Volker1 aReich, Felix1 aKlein, G√ºnter.0 tJournal of food protection.g2008 Dec., v. 71, no. 12 p.2533-2536x0362-028X7nnas  aDNAL  a20090114b20090206c00000000  aINDdPNNe2009/01/13  aOther US 7aarticle03247naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002100152245005400173300001600227500019700243500002400440520183400464650001302298650001202311650002002323650002602343650003102369650001602400650002702416650001902443650001102462650001102473650001702484650001302501700001702514700001802531700001602549700001902565773014002584852000902724856009202733655001202825IND4463988120221119165206.0120828s2012    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446398812DNAL7 a10.17660/ActaHortic.2012.952.1162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHenten, E.J. van10aMeasuring leaf motion of tomato by machine vision  ap. 915-922.  aPaper presented at the International Symposium on Advanced Technologies and Management towards Sustainable Greenhouse Ecosystems - GreenSys2011, volume 2, held June 5-10, 2011, Athens, Greece.  aIncludes references  aFor a better understanding of growth and development of tomato plants in three dimensional space, tomato plants were monitored using a computer vision system. It is commonly known that leaves of tomato plants do not have a fixed position and orientation during the day; they move in response to changing environmental conditions such as the position of the sun. For better understanding, it was desired to quantify this motion. Using a stereovision concept, two cameras were mounted in an experimental greenhouse a short distance apart from each other to enable depth measurement. Markers were placed on strategic spots on the tomato plant branches and leaves in the field of view of both cameras. Images were taken every ten minutes during daytime on several consecutive days. In the greenhouse, a virtual 3D coordinate system was defined and camera and tomato plant position and orientation were defined in this coordinate system. Image processing techniques were used to trace the markers and the 3D position coordinate of each marker in each image was calculated to obtain the course of a marker during several days. Stems, branches, and leaf nerves were considered as kinematic mechanical, robot like, links and corresponding theory was used to model and calculate the motion of stems and leaves of a tomato plant. Analysis of the images showed both small (1-2 degrees) and large rotations (10 degrees or more) of the branches and the different leaves on a branch during the course of a day. Leaves on one side of a branch showed a parallel motion in the same direction; the leaves on the opposite side of the branch showed a mirrored motion. However, deviating patterns occurred too. The developed method proved to be able to precisely quantify the motion of stems, branches and leaves of tomato plants during several days. 3abranches 3acameras 3acomputer vision 3aenvironmental factors 3agreenhouse experimentation 3agreenhouses 3agrowth and development 3aimage analysis 3aleaves 3amodels 3anerve tissue 3atomatoes1 aMarx, G.E.H.1 aHofstee, J.W.1 aHemming, J.1 aSarlikioti, V.0 tActa horticulturae.g2012 June, , no. 952 p.915-922dInternational Society for Horticultural SciencewJournal:jnl46289x0567-75727nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.17660/ActaHortic.2012.952.1163Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02648naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004100092040001800133100001500151245009800166300001600264500016800280500002400448520121700472650001101689650001201700650001301712650001201725650001701737650001001754650001301764650001401777650003001791650004501821650001201866700001601878700001901894700001701913700001601930700001501946700001401961773013901975852000902114856009102123655001202214IND4463992720221119165243.0120829s2012    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446399272DNAL7 a10.17660/ActaHortic.2012.948.202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRahemi, A.12aA PCR based RFLP survey of S-alleles in wild and cultivated almond and related Prunus species  ap. 181-188.  aPaper presented at the First International Symposium on Wild Relatives of Subtropical and Temperate Fruit and Nut Crops, held March 19-23, 2011, Davis, California.  aIncludes references  aAlmond is one of the most important nut crops in the world. The origin of almond is central and west Asia. About 30 wild species are identified in this region which represent a rich source of desirable characteristics useful in almond breeding programs. However, almonds express gametophytic self- and cross-incompatibility which affects breeding parent selection. Incompatibility in almond is controlled by a multi-allelic, single gene (S-locus). Recently chemical and molecular methods have been utilized to survey the S-alleles in almond cultivars and closely related species. The restriction fragment length polymorphism method using CAPs protocol was used to determin S-alleles in multiple accessions of wild almond and related Prunus species. Polymerase chain reactions were carried out using one set of degenerate primer pairs (EM-PC2consFD/EM-PC3consRD), and PCR products were digested by five restriction enzymes (TaqI, HinfI, DpnI, ApoI and AluI). The genotypes revealed different cutting paterns. ApoI and DpnI produced the most and the least bandings respectively. AluI, ApoI and HinfI digested the S7. ApoI was the only enzyme which could digest the S9. TaqI, ApoI and HinfI digested the S8 and S12. 3aPrunus 3aalmonds 3abreeding 3aenzymes 3agametophytes 3agenes 3agenotype 3anut crops 3apolymerase chain reaction 3arestriction fragment length polymorphism 3asurveys1 aHassani, D.1 aGradziel, T.M.1 aChaparro, J.1 aTaghavi, T.1 aFatahi, R.1 aEbadi, A.0 tActa horticulturae.g2012 May, , no. 948 p.181-188dInternational Society for Horticultural SciencewJournal:jnl46289x0567-75727nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.17660/ActaHortic.2012.948.203Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02343naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001900110245012300129300001600252520111900268650002101387650001601408650001001424650002601434650002701460650001801487650001501505650001601520650003001536650002501566653001201591653002201603653002101625653001201646653001901658653002801677653001901705700001801724700001601742773007101758852000901829930003301838945001301871946001301884655001201897IND2044388120221119165021.0950201e199405  mnu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204438812DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTisserat, N.A.10aSelective amplification of rDNA internal transcribed spacer regions to detect Ophiospaerella korrae and O. herpotricha  ap. 478-482.  aThe internal transcribed spacer (ITS) regions of the rDNA Or Ophiosphaerella herpotricha and O. korrae (= Leptosphaeria korrae) were amplified with the universal primers ITS4 and ITS5. Amplifications of genomic DNA from O. herpotricha isolates always resulted in a single 590-bp fragment, whereas amplifications of O. korrae isolates resulted in a single fragment of either 590 or 1,019 bp. Primers specific for O. herpotricha (OHITS1 and OHITS2) and O. korrae (OKITS1 and OKITS2) were derived from sequence analyses of the ITS regions. The OHITS primers amplified a 454-bp fragment from DNA of O. herpotricha but not from DNA of O. korrae or 29 other fungal or bacterial species. Similarly, the OKITS primers amplified a 454-bp fragment from DNA of O. korrae isolates only. The OHITS and OKITS primers also detected O. herpotricha or O. korrae, respectively, in total DNA preparations from greenhouse-inoculated or naturally infected bermudagrass roots. These primers can be used to rapidly diagnose turfgrass patch diseases caused by O. herpotricha and O. korrae without culturing the fungi from diseased tissue. 3aCynodon dactylon 3aDothideales 3aroots 3adiagnostic techniques 3aplant pathogenic fungi 3aribosomal DNA 3apathotypes 3anucleotides 3apolymerase chain reaction 3anucleotide sequences 0aspecies 0adna amplification 0aspring dead spot 0aprimers 0agenbank/u04862 0amolecular sequence data 0agenbank/u048611 aHulbert, S.H.1 aSauer, K.M.0 tPhytopathology.g1994 May, v. 84, no. 5 p.478-482x0031-949X7nnas  aDNAL  a19950303b19950309c00000000  aINDdMKS  aOther US 7aarticle03235naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134072000900152100001600161245014600177300001600323500002400339500001500363520177100378650002202149650001602171650001502187650001602202650001802218650003002236650003202266650001202298650001802310650002002328650002102348650002002369653003602389653002302425653002502448700001602473700001602489773009202505852000902597856007602606930003302682945002502715946001302740655001202753IND4380491420221119165143.0060526e200606  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438049142DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biocontrol.2005.10.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF8211 aRebek, E.J.10aInfluence of floral resource plants on control of an armored scale pest by the parasitoid Encarsia citrina (Craw.)

The herbivore was euonymus scale, Unaspis euonymi (Comstock) (Homoptera: Diaspididae), a serious pest of woody ornamental plants. The experimental landscape consisted of 3 x 3 m plots, each containing a central bed of Euonymus fortunei (Turcz.) that was infested with the scale. Floral resource plants were cultivars of four species that overlapped in bloom periods to provide a continuous supply of floral resources during summer: Trifolium repens L., Euphorbia epithymoides L., Coreopsis verticillata L. var. 'Moonbeam,' and Solidago canadensis L. var. 'Golden Baby.' Plots contained either low or high densities of all four species, or no resource plants. Densities of euonymus scale were typically lower in plots containing resource plants than in plots without them. Parasitism by Encarsia citrina (Craw.) (Hymenoptera: Aphelinidae) was rarely influenced by the experimental treatments, flower biomass, whole-plant biomass, or scale density, but in some cases was inversely correlated with density of scales within a generation and in the subsequent generation. Parasitism occasionally reduced densities of scales in plots containing resource plants, but this effect apparently was related to vegetative, not floral qualities of plants. A steady increase in parasitism rate over the three-year course of the experiment across the entire landscape was associated with decreasing density of scales, suggesting a numerical response by the parasitoid population. These findings suggest that the parasitoid is capable of effectively controlling euonymus scale in ornamental landscapes where environmental conditions are favorable. 3aEuonymus fortunei 3aparasitoids 3aparasitism 3afood plants 3ascale insects 3abiological control agents 3ahost-parasite relationships 3aflowers 3aplant density 3aUnaspis euonymi 3aEncarsia citrina 3anatural enemies 0aconservation biological control 0apopulation density 0ahabitat manipulation1 aSadof, C.S.1 aHanks, L.M.0 tBiological control.g2006 June, v. 37, no. 3 p.320-328dAcademic Pressx1049-96447nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biocontrol.2005.10.0093electronic resource  a20060615b20060702c00000000  aINDdNZMe2006/06/13  aOther US 7aarticle03382naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004000092040001800132100002000150245011200170300001400282500016800296500002400464520166000488650002102148650002002169650001402189650000902203650002402212650002102236650002102257650001302278650001302291650002002304650001202324650001002336650001402346650001302360650001002373650001802383650002202401650001702423650003202440650001502472650001002487650001802497650001202515651001202527700001702539700001602556700002002572773013702592852000902729856009002738655001202828IND4463990820221119165234.0120829s2012    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446399082DNAL7 a10.17660/ActaHortic.2012.948.72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAyala-Silva, T.10aApplication of Propiconazole in management of laurel wilt disease in avocado (Persea americana Mill.) trees  ap. 71-78.  aPaper presented at the First International Symposium on Wild Relatives of Subtropical and Temperate Fruit and Nut Crops, held March 19-23, 2011, Davis, California.  aIncludes references  aLaurel wilt is a vascular disease of Lauraceous plants caused by a fungus (Raffaelea spp.) that is carried by a recently introduced, nonnative ambrosia beetle (Xyleborus glabratus). The disease is devastating to Persea species including redbay (Persea borbonia) and avocado (Persea americana) trees in forests, parks, orchards and residential areas in the southeastern United States. Avocado is the most important agricultural crop susceptible to laurel wilt. Management strategies for reducing its impact in Persea sp. (specifically P. Americana) are needed. The USDA ARS NPGS collection of avocado is conserved at the National Germplasm Repository (NGR) in Miami-Dade County Florida. Although the avocado collection is currently free from the ambrosia beetle and the laurel wilt disease, it is believed to be only a matter of time before this insect/disease complex reaches the collection. Macro infusion of the fungicide Propiconazole (Alamo¬Æ) has been shown to control the disease in red bay and other oak species. In this study, the use of the systemic fungicide Propiconazole (Alamo¬Æ) macro infusion through the root system was infused at the recommended doses. Plants were infused in June 2009 and again in February 2011. The rate of application varied greatly with the diameter of tree trunk at breast level (dbl). The rates recommended on the Alamo¬Æ label were the rates use initially. Results from research conducted in redbay suggest propiconazole could be useful in preventing laurel wilt in redbay and other Persea species. Preliminary results demonstrated propiconazole was present in branches of trees injected 14 months after treatment. 3aPersea americana 3aPersea borbonia 3aRaffaelea 3aUSDA 3aXyleborus glabratus 3aambrosia beetles 3aapplication rate 3aavocados 3abranches 3adisease control 3aforests 3afungi 3agermplasm 3aorchards 3aparks 3apropiconazole 3aresidential areas 3aroot systems 3atree and stand measurements 3atree trunk 3atrees 3avascular wilt 3awilting 3aFlorida1 aGordon, G.G.1 aSchnell, R.1 aWinterstein, M.0 tActa horticulturae.g2012 May, , no. 948 p.71-78dInternational Society for Horticultural SciencewJournal:jnl46289x0567-75727nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.17660/ActaHortic.2012.948.73Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02676naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003100092040001800123100002700141245011000168300001800278500002400296520146000320650002001780650002201800650002601822650001901848650001001867650002801877650001101905650001201916650001301928650001401941650001501955650001501970650001301985650001001998650001002008650001302018650001002031700002202041773008902063852000902152856008102161655001202242IND4464001320221119165206.0120904s2003    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446400132DNAL7 a10.1081/PLN-1200200722doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKadiata, Bakach Dikand10aDifferential Phosphorus Uptake and Use Efficiency Among Selected Nitrogen‚ÄêFixing Tree Legumes over Time  ap. 1009-1022.  aIncludes references  aA study was carried out on three nitrogen (N2)‚Äêfixing tree legumes, i.e., Gliricidia sepium cv. ILG50, Leucaena leucocephala cv. K28, and Albizia lebbeck to assess their differential phosphorus (P) nutrition capability over time. Dry‚Äêmatter (DM) yields, P concentration, P uptake and partitioning in plants, and P use efficiency were estimated at 4, 8, 12, and 16 months after planting (MAP). The trees showed a large interspecific variation both in DM yields and P uptake. Concentration of P ranged from 0.042 to 0.275% and varied both among parts in each tree and among tree species over time. Leaves P concentrations showed a greater reduction with tree age than either stems or roots. Phosphorus uptake correlated significantly with plant DM (r = 0.893‚Äì0.946) across tree species, and had a steady increasing pattern up to at least 12 MAP. Over ages, Gliricidia outperformed the other species in P uptake. However, Leucaena was the most efficient user of P followed by Albizia and Gliricidia, in that order. Further, Leucaena revealed an attractive feature for alley cropping in that it stored up to 37% of the P accumulated in its leaves in contrast to only 24.1% for Gliricidia and 19.2% for Albizia. Therefore, the low P supply by trees into alley cropping is in part due to its unbalanced partitioning into stems to the expenses of leaves. The study shows also that P concentration in perennials is lower than it is reported in annual crops. 3aAlbizia lebbeck 3aGliricidia sepium 3aLeucaena leucocephala 3aalley cropping 3acrops 3ainterspecific variation 3aleaves 3alegumes 3anitrogen 3anutrition 3aperennials 3aphosphorus 3aplanting 3aroots 3astems 3atree age 3atrees1 aLumpungu, Kabamba0 tJournal of plant nutrition.g2003, v. 26, no. 5 p.1009-1022dDekkerx0190-41677nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1081/PLN-1200200723Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02765naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004000092040001800132100002400150245012000174300001400294500016800308500002400476520137600500650002001876650002101896650002101917650001801938650002301956650001701979650001201996650002202008650003202030650001002062651001702072651000902089700001602098700001702114773013702131852000902268856009002277655001202367IND4463991020221119165318.0120829s2012    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446399102DNAL7 a10.17660/ActaHortic.2012.948.92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJafari Sayadi, M.H.10aComparison of four geographically diverse natural populations of Persian walnut (Juglans regia L.) in north of Iran  ap. 91-96.  aPaper presented at the First International Symposium on Wild Relatives of Subtropical and Temperate Fruit and Nut Crops, held March 19-23, 2011, Davis, California.  aIncludes references  aPersian walnut (Juglans regia L.) is thought to have originated in the mountainous regions of Central Asia, including the forests of northern Iran. Remaining wild stands of this genetic resource are located within diverse associated communities of plant species. To study the tree species associated with the natural walnut populations of the northern forests of Iran, four distinct geographical populations located at Astara (38¬∞19' N and 48¬∞44'), Roudsar (36¬∞55.5' N and 50¬∞16'), Takke Kamar (36¬∞47.5' N and 55¬∞5') and Ali Abad (36¬∞50.7' N and 55¬∞7') were studied. The populations found in the western region, the Hyrcanian forest, were larger than those farther east, but eastern populations were less disturbed and found in more purely wild stands. In the Astara region, the dominant plant community was Parrotia-Carpinetum and the dominant plant species were Alnus glutinosa (L.) Gaerth, Alnus subcordata C.A. Mey, Diospyrus lotus L. and Juglans regia L. The stand was even aged and the largest DBH (Diameter at Breast Height) was 91 cm. The tallest tree had a height of 26 m. In the Ali Abad region, the plant community was Querco-Carpinetum and the dominant plant species were Carpinus betulus L., Ulmus glabra Huds and Tilia platyphyllos Scop. subsp. Caucasica. The stand was even aged, the largest DBH was 131 cm, and the tallest tree was 42 m in height. 3aAlnus glutinosa 3aAlnus subcordata 3aCarpinus betulus 3aJuglans regia 3aTilia platyphyllos 3aUlmus glabra 3aforests 3aplant communities 3atree and stand measurements 3atrees 3aCentral Asia 3aIran1 aVahdati, K.1 aLeslie, C.A.0 tActa horticulturae.g2012 May, , no. 948 p.91-96dInternational Society for Horticultural SciencewJournal:jnl46289x0567-75727nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.17660/ActaHortic.2012.948.93Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02498naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100003500145245010300180300001600283500002400299520150100323650002801824650001101852650002101863650001801884650001401902650001301916650001601929700003801945700002101983773011102004852000902115856004802124655001202172IND4422507420090704004353.0090626e200907  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442250742DNAL7 a10.1007/s00217-009-1071-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMachado, Rita Margarete Donato10aSulfite content in some Brazilian wines: analytical determination and estimate of dietary exposure  ap. 383-389.  aIncludes references  aBrazilian wines of different regions and that commercially available in the city of Campinas, SP, were analysed for their contents of sulfites. Dietary exposure to sulfites from Brazilian wines was also assessed by combining sulfite levels determined analytically with three hypothetical scenarios of daily wine consumption: 150, 300, and 450 mL. In all samples, the concentration of sulfites was below the maximum permitted level (MPL) of 350 mg L‚Åª¬π set in the Brazilian legislation with most samples (88%) containing residual sulfite below 150 mg L‚Åª¬π. The dietary exposure to sulfites from regular consumption of 150 mL of national white wines containing sulfites at the mean level of 122.0 mg L‚Åª¬π covered 44% of the Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) established by JECFA for these preservatives (0.7 mg kg‚Åª¬π bw). For high regular consumption (450 mL per day) of white wines, the dietary exposure could reach 131% of the ADI. In the case of national red wines (SO‚ÇÇ mean level of 71.3 mg L‚Åª¬π) the dietary exposure was lower, ranging from 26 to 76% of the ADI for 150 and 450 mL of daily consumption, respectively. The present study indicates that although sulfite levels in national wines is usually below the MPL (mean of 98.5 mg L‚Åª¬π) a regular moderate consumption of 150 mL per day could lead to a dietary exposure of 15 mg of sulfites (0.25 mg kg‚Åª¬π bw in a 60-kg adult), covering one-third of the ADI. A regular heavy consumption (450 mL per day) would cover the full ADI. 3aacceptable daily intake 3aadults 3adietary exposure 3apreservatives 3ared wines 3asulfites 3awhite wines1 aToledo, Maria Cec√≠lia Figueiredo1 aVicente, Eduardo0 tEuropean food research & technology.g2009 July, v. 229, no. 3 p.383-389dSpringer-Verlagx1438-23777nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00217-009-1071-7 7aarticle02772naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004400092040001800136100002200154245014200176300001600318500002400334500001500358520173300373650001102106650001402117650001602131650001402147650001802161650001402179650001302193653001002206700002002216773013202236852000902368856005702377655001202434IND4461145320221119165128.0110805e199103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446114532DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1095-8339.1991.tb00205.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTEICHMAN, IRMGARD10aTrends in the evolution of dicotyledonous seeds based on character associations, with special reference to pachychalazy and recalcitrance  ap. 211-237.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aVON TEICHMAN, I. & VAN WYK, A. E., 1991. Trends in the evolution of dicotyledonous seeds based on character associations, with special reference to pachychalazy and recalcitrance. The possible evolutionary status of the endothelium, hypostase, pachychalaza and the recalcitrant viability behaviour of seeds is considered in relation to bitegmy/unitegmy, crassinucellate/tenuinucellate ovules, nuclear/cellular endosperm development, large/small seed size, woody/herbaceous habit and tropical/temperate habitat. The presence of the endothelium, hypostase, pachychalaza and recalcitrance in dicotyledonous families is plotted against Dahlgren's system of classification. Results are compared with Sporne's advancement index for the various families. An endothelium is considered derived since it occurs more often in highly evolved superorders and is significantly associated with derived ovule and endosperm character states as well as with smaller seed size. A hypostase appears to be relatively ancestral and is significantly associated with pachychalazy and recalcitrance. The endothelium and hypostase have developed independently in many taxa and could be interpreted as being structurally and functionally analogous. Pachychalazy and recalcitrance are significantly associated with ancestral ovule character states and, at the species level, with large seed size (overgrown seed), woody habit and tropical habitat. The presence of pachychalazy, recalcitrance and associated large seed size are therefore regarded as ancestral character states of the dicotyledons. Consideration of currently accepted dicta on seed character state polarity, suggests a reversal in the evolutionary status of pachychalazy and large seed size. 3aovules 3aviability 3aendothelium 3aevolution 3aMagnoliopsida 3aendosperm 3ahabitats 0aseeds1 aWYK, ABRAHAM E.0 tBotanical journal of the Linnean Society.g1991 Mar., v. 105, no. 3 p.211-237dBlackwell Publishing Ltdw50684x0024-40747nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1095-8339.1991.tb00205.x 7aarticle02574naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003100092040001800123100002700141245007200168300001800240500002400258520150900282650002001791650001301811650002101824650001601845650004301861650003201904650000901936700001801945700003801963700002002001700002002021773009302041852000902134856008102143655001202224IND4464003020221119165222.0120904s2003    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446400302DNAL7 a10.1081/PLN-1200242602doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGarc√≠a‚ÄêMarco, Sonia10aEvaluation of Commercial Fe(III)‚ÄêChelates Using Different Methods  ap. 2009-2021.  aIncludes references  aA collaborative assay among three laboratories was made in order to compare both the ion (CEN.

This Cu(II)‚Äêreduction has been less studied and it has been suggested that Cu2+ ion rather than Cu2+‚Äêchelate serves as the substrate. Ferric‚Äêchelate reductase activity is inhibited by some metals, but the mechanisms implicated are not known. In the present work we use Fe‚Äêdeficient cucumber seedlings to study the interactions of Cu2+, Ni2+, Mn4+, and Fe3+ on both Fe(III)‚Äêreduction and Cu(II)‚Äêreduction activities. The response of Cu(II)‚Äêreduction activity to Cu concentration, in the presence or absence of citrate, was also studied. Results showed that inhibition of the ferric‚Äêchelate reductase activity by Cu2+ or Ni2+ could be partially reversed by increasing the concentration of Fe‚ÄêEDTA. The Cu(II)‚Äêreduction activity was even stimulated by Fe‚ÄêEDTA or Ni2+; it was inhibited by a high concentration of Cu2+ itself; and it was not affected by the absence of citrate. Mn4+ caused a moderate inhibition of both Fe(III)‚Äêreduction and Cu(II)‚Äêreduction activities. Results agree with the hypothesis that free Cu2+ ion is the substrate for Cu(II)‚Äêreduction and suggest that the mechanisms involved in Fe(III)‚Äêreduction and Cu(II)‚Äêreduction could have some differences and be affected by metals in different ways. The mode of action of metals on the reductase activity are discussed, but they are still not well known. 3acitrates 3acopper 3acucumbers 3aions 3airon 3amechanism of action 3anutrient deficiencies 3aroots 3aseedlings1 aMontilla, Inmaculada1 aRomera, Francisco J.1 aAlc√°ntara, Esteban0 tJournal of plant nutrition.g2003, v. 26, no. 10-11 p.2069-2079dDekkerx0190-41677nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1081/PLN-1200242653Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02604naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002200145245004900167300001600216500002400232520148200256650002301738650001301761650001901774650001901793650001601812650002301828650001901851650001301870650001501883650001501898650002101913650001901934650001401953650002601967650002701993650001602020773010102036852000902137856004802146655001202194IND4414864720221119165304.0090109e200901  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441486472DNAL7 a10.1007/s11101-008-9116-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMuller, Caroline.10aRole of glucosinolates in plant invasiveness  ap. 227-242.  aIncludes references  aMany plants have been intentionally or accidentally introduced to new habitats where some of them now cause major ecological and economic threats to natural and agricultural ecosystems. The potential to become invasive might depend on plant characteristics, as well as on specific interactions with other organisms acting as symbionts or antagonists, including other plants, microbes, herbivores, or pollinators. The invasion potential furthermore depends on abiotic conditions in the habitat. Several species of the Brassicaceae, well known for their glucosinolate-myrosinase defence system, are invasive species. Various factors are reviewed here that might explain why these species were so successful in colonising new areas. Specific emphasis is laid on the role of glucosinolates and their hydrolysis products in the invasion potential. This particular defence system is involved specifically in plant-plant, plant-microbe and plant-insect interactions. Most research has been done on the mechanisms underlying invasion success of Alliaria petiolata and Brassica spp., followed by Bunias orientalis and Lepidium draba. Some examples are also given for plants that are not necessarily considered as invasives, but which were well investigated with respect to their interference potential with their biotic environment. For each species, most likely a combination of different plant characteristics enhanced the competitive abilities and led to diverse invasive phenotypes. 3aAlliaria petiolata 3aBrassica 3aLepidium draba 3aagroecosystems 3aantagonists 3acolonizing ability 3aglucosinolates 3ahabitats 3aherbivores 3ahydrolysis 3ainvasive species 3amicroorganisms 3aphenotype 3aplant characteristics 3aplant-insect relations 3apollinators0 tPhytochemistry reviews.g2009 Jan., v. 8, no. 1 p.227-242dSpringer Netherlandsx1568-77677nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11101-008-9116-2 7aarticle03417naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119072000900137100001300146245019300159300001800352500002400370520143900394650002201833650001501855650001701870650001801887650001701905650003001922650002801952650003001980650002702010650001702037650002202054650002802076650002002104650002902124650002302153650001702176650002502193650001502218650001102233653003502244653003602279653003002315653002102345653002902366700001602395700001502411700001702426700002002443700002102463773016202484852000902646856007702655930003302732945002502765946001302790655001202803IND4380465020221119165348.0060525e20060322xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438046502DNAL7 a10.1021/jf052768e2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aT3001 aGlei, M.10aBoth wheat (Triticum aestivum) bran arabinoxylans and gut flora-mediated fermentation products protect human colon cells from genotoxic activities of 4-hydroxynonenal and hydrogen peroxide  ap. 2088-2095.  aIncludes references  aDietary fibers are fermented by the gut flora to yield short chain fatty acids (SCFAs), which inhibit the growth of tumor cells, induce glutathione S-transferases (GSTs), and protect cells from the genotoxic activity of 4-hydroxynonenal (HNE). Here, we investigated effects of wheat bran-derived arabinoxylans and fermentation products on these parameters of chemoprevention. Newly isolated water extractable (WeAx) and alkali extractable arabinoxylans (AeAx) were fermented under anaerobic conditions with human feces. Resulting fermentation supernatants (FSs) were analyzed for SCFAs and used to treat HT29 colon cancer cells. Cell growth, cytotoxicity, antigenotoxicity against hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) or HNE, and GST activity were determined. Nonfermented WeAx decreased H2O2-induced DNA damage by 64%, thus demonstrating chemoprotective properties by this nonfermented wheat bran fiber. The fermentation of WeAx and AeAx resulted in 3-fold increases of SCFA, but all FSs (including the control without arabinoxylans) inhibited the growth of the HT29 cells, reduced the genotoxicity of HNE, and enhanced the activity of GSTs (FS WeAx, 2-fold; FS AeAx, 1.7-fold; and control FS, 1.4-fold), which detoxify HNE. Thus, increases in SCFAs were not reflected by enhanced functional effects. The conclusion is that fermentation mixtures contain modulatory compounds that arise from the feces and might add to the effectiveness of SCFAs. 3aTriticum aestivum 3awheat bran 3aarabinoxylan 3adietary fiber 3afermentation 3aintestinal microorganisms 3ashort chain fatty acids 3aanticarcinogenic activity 3aantimutagenic activity 3agenotoxicity 3ahydrogen peroxide 3aglutathione transferase 3aenzyme activity 3ametabolic detoxification 3acell proliferation 3acytotoxicity 3acolorectal neoplasms 3acell lines 3ahumans 0awater extractable arabinoxylan 0aalkali extractable arabinoxylan 0afermentation supernatants 0a4-hydroxynonenal 0aantiproliferative effect1 aHofmann, T.1 aKuster, K.1 aHollmann, J.1 aLindhauer, M.G.1 aPool-Zobel, B.L.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2006 Mar. 22, v. 54, no. 6 p.2088-2095dAmerican Chemical Society, Books and Journals Division]x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf052768e3Available from publisher's Web site  a20060809b20060906c00000000  aINDdRHFe2006/06/28  aOther US 7aarticle02861naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119072000900137072000900146072000900155100002000164245013500184300001800319500002400337520128200361650001301643650001601656650002301672650001901695650002101714650002201735650001701757650000901774650002001783650001501803650001101818650002101829650001501850650001601865650002501881653001601906653001601922653001701938700001501955700001501970700001501985773016202000852000902162856007702171930003302248945002502281946001302306655001202319IND4380500720221119165136.0060530e20060419xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438050072DNAL7 a10.1021/jf052610u2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aW000 0aH000 0aF2001 aKawahigashi, H.10aPhytoremediation of the herbicides atrazine and metolachlor by transgenic rice plants expressing human CYP1A1, CYP2B6, and CYP2C19  ap. 2985-2991.  aIncludes references  aThis study evaluated the expression of human cytochrome P450 genes CYP1A1, CYP2B6, and CYP2C19 in rice plants (Oryza sativa cv. Nipponbare) introduced using the plasmid pIKBACH. The transgenic rice plants (pIKBACH rice plants) became more tolerant toward various herbicides than nontransgenic Nipponbare rice plants. Rice plants expressing pIKBACH grown in soil showed tolerance to the herbicides atrazine, metolachlor, and norflurazon and to a mixture of the three herbicides. The degradation of atrazine and metolachlor by pIKBACH rice plants was evaluated to confirm the metabolic activity of the introduced P450s. Although both pIKBACH and nontransgenic Nipponbare rice plants could decrease the amounts of the herbicides in plant tissue and culture medium, pIKBACH rice plants removed greater amounts in greenhouse experiments. The ability of pIKBACH rice plants to remove atrazine and metolachlor from soil was confirmed in large-scale experiments. The metabolism of herbicides by pIKBACH rice plants was enhanced by the introduced P450 species. Assuming that public and commercial acceptance is forthcoming, pIKBACH rice plants may become useful tools for the breeding of herbicide-tolerant crops and for phytoremediation of environmental pollution by organic chemicals. 3aatrazine 3ametolachlor 3aherbicide residues 3asoil pollution 3aphytoremediation 3atransgenic plants 3aOryza sativa 3arice 3agene expression 3atransgenes 3ahumans 3acytochrome P-450 3ametabolism 3anorflurazon 3aherbicide resistance 0aCYP1A1 gene 0aCYP2B6 gene 0aCYP2C19 gene1 aHirose, S.1 aOhkawa, H.1 aOhkawa, Y.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2006 Apr. 19, v. 54, no. 8 p.2985-2991dAmerican Chemical Society, Books and Journals Division]x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf052610u3Available from publisher's Web site  a20060718b20060804c00000000  aINDdRHFe2006/07/18  aOther US 7aarticle02832naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119072000900137072000900146100001600155245011700171300001800288500002400306520129600330650001701626650001801643650002001661650001901681650002801700650001701728650001201745650001301757650001501770650000901785650002201794650001701816650001001833650001101843653002401854653002901878653003001907653002201937700001801959700001801977773016201995852000902157856007702166930003302243945002502276946001302301655001202314IND4380500920221119165142.0060530e20060419xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438050092DNAL7 a10.1021/jf051791x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ103 0aQ5031 aZamri, A.I.10aEffect of combined heat and high-pressure treatments on the texture of chicken breast muscle (Pectoralis fundus)  ap. 2992-2996.  aIncludes references  aCommercially supplied chicken breast muscle was subjected to simultaneous heat and pressure treatments. Treatment conditions ranged from ambient temperature to 70 degrees C and from 0.1 to 800 MPa, respectively, in various combinations. Texture profile analysis (TPA) of the treated samples was performed to determine changes in muscle hardness. At treatment temperatures up to and including 50 degrees C, heat and pressure acted synergistically to increase muscle hardness. However, at 60 and 70 degrees C, hardness decreased following treatments in excess of 200 MPa. TPA was performed on extracted myofibrillar protein gels that after treatment under similar conditions revealed similar effects of heat and pressure. Differential scanning calorimetry analysis of whole muscle samples revealed that at ambient pressure the unfolding of myosin was completed at 60 degrees C, unlike actin, which completely denatured only above 70 degrees C. With simultaneous pressure treatment at >200 MPa, myosin and actin unfolded at 20 degrees C. Unfolding of myosin and actin could be induced in extracted myofibrillar protein with simultaneous treatment at 200 MPa and 40 degrees C. Electrophoretic analysis indicated high pressure/temperature regimens induced disulfide bonding between myosin chains. 3achicken meat 3abreast muscle 3afood processing 3aheat treatment 3ahigh pressure treatment 3ameat quality 3atexture 3ahardness 3amyofibrils 3agels 3aprotein structure 3adenaturation 3aactin 3amyosin 0achicken breast meat 0atexture profile analysis 0amyofibrillar protein gels 0aprotein unfolding1 aLedward, D.A.1 aFrazier, R.A.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2006 Apr. 19, v. 54, no. 8 p.2992-2996dAmerican Chemical Society, Books and Journals Division]x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf051791x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20060718b20060804c00000000  aINDdRHFe2006/07/18  aOther US 7aarticle02365naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003100092040001800123100001900141245008300160300001800243500002400261520140600285650002501691650001301716650001401729650002101743650001401764650001301778650001301791700001101804700001601815700001701831773008901848852000901937856008101946655001202027IND4464005820221119165015.0120904s2003    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446400582DNAL7 a10.1081/PLN-1200232812doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPeng, Xinxiang10aGenotypic Difference in Aluminum Resistance and Oxalate Exudation of Buckwheat  ap. 1767-1777.  aIncludes references  aGenotypic difference in aluminum (Al) resistance of buckwheat (Fagopyrum esculentum Moench.) was first tested using a simple salt solution (0.5 mM CaCl2) containing 25 ¬µM AlCl3. Two contrasting genotypes, resistant 92‚Äê1 vs. sensitive Liangqiao 1, were selected out of five, and further tested by a long‚Äêterm Al treatment in 1/5 strength of Hoagland solution. Consistent results were obtained by the two methods although much higher Al3+ concentration was needed to cause the genotypic difference in the culture solution (up to 2000 ¬µM compared with 25 ¬µM Al3+ in simple salt solution). Oxalate content and exudation was decreased when the plants were subjected to the long‚Äêterm Al treatment of both genotypes, 92‚Äê1, however, excreted more oxalate than Liangqiao 1 either in Al‚Äêtreated or non‚Äêtreated plants. If the plants were treated with 100 ¬µM Al3+ in 0.5 mM CaCl2 solution for 24 h, oxalate exudation was very significantly induced: 4‚Äêfold increase for 92‚Äê1 and 1‚Äêfold increase for Liangqiao 1. This supports the previous report that Al‚Äêinduced oxalate exudation is a rapid response and may not last a long time. It is, therefore, suggested that the constitutive excreted and internal oxalate may be able to contribute more than the induced oxalate in copying with Al toxicity as well as conferring the genotypic difference especially when the stress is strong and lasting. 3aFagopyrum esculentum 3aaluminum 3abuckwheat 3acalcium chloride 3aexudation 3agenotype 3atoxicity1 aYu, Le1 aYang, Chong1 aLiu, Yonghai0 tJournal of plant nutrition.g2003, v. 26, no. 9 p.1767-1777dDekkerx0190-41677nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1081/PLN-1200232813Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02723naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119072000900137072000900146100001500155245008900170300001800259500002400277500001500301520124000316650002201556650001001578650001501588650001801603650002301621650002401644650002801668650002501696650001501721653002701736653001801763653001701781653002501798653001401823653001701837700001401854700001401868700001601882773016201898852000902060856007702069930003302146945002502179946001302204655001202217IND4380500120221119165001.0060530e20060419xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438050012DNAL7 a10.1021/jf052900a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF600 0aS2001 aPark, J.S.10aEnzymatic preparation of kaempferol from green tea seed and its antioxidant activity  ap. 2951-2956.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aAmong the flavonols in green tea, kaempferol has many biological activities but kaempferol of plant origin is too expensive to be used in commercial products. Recently, we confirmed that green tea seed (GTS) contained a reasonable amount of kaempferol glycoside. After conducting structure analysis, two kaempferol glycosides were identified, kaempferol-3-O-[2-O-beta-D-galactopyranosyl-6-O-alpha-L-rhamnopyranosyl]-beta-D-glucopyranoside (compound 1) and kaempferol-3-O-[2-O-beta-D-xylopyranosyl-6-O-alpha-L-rhamnopyranosyl]-beta-D-glucopyranoside (compound 2), respectively. Also, a commercially useful method for kaempferol preparation was suggested by enzymatic hydrolysis using these two flavonoids. After several enzyme reactions were performed for the complete bioconversion of compounds 1 and 2 to kaempferol, we found that the optimum enzyme combination was reaction with beta-galactosidase and hesperidinase. Finally, we produced pure kaempferol with over 95% purity. We also compared the antioxidant effect of these two GTS flavonoids and its aglycone, kaempferol. Kaempferol is a more efficient scavenger of 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl radicals and a better inhibitor of xanthine/xanthine oxidase than the two glycosides. 3aCamellia sinensis 3aseeds 3akaempferol 3afree radicals 3abeta-galactosidase 3aenzymatic treatment 3afree radical scavengers 3aantioxidant activity 3aglycosides 0aO-glycoside hydrolases 0ahesperidinase 0aglycosidases 0akaempferol glycoside 0aisolation 0aantioxidants1 aRho, H.S.1 aKim, D.H.1 aChang, I.S.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2006 Apr. 19, v. 54, no. 8 p.2951-2956dAmerican Chemical Society, Books and Journals Division]x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf052900a3Available from publisher's Web site  a20060718b20060804c00000000  aINDdRHFe2006/07/18  aOther US 7aarticle03800naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003100092040001800123100002000141245013100161300001800292500002400310520237700334650004302711650001602754650001402770650001802784650001702802650001302819650000902832650001102841650001102852650001602863650001202879650002102891650002302912650001902935650002002954650001902974650001302993650001703006650001503023700002403038700001703062700002103079700002303100773009303123852000903216856008103225655001203306IND4464004020221119165222.0120904s2003    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446400402DNAL7 a10.1081/PLN-1200242702doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDonnini, Silvia10aLeaf Responses to Reduced Iron Availability in Two Tomato Genotypes: T3238FER (Iron Efficient) and T3238fer (Iron Inefficient)  ap. 2137-2148.  aIncludes references  aThe present work is aimed at evaluating some effects induced by different levels of iron availability in the growth medium for two different tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill.) genotypes, the T3238fer (Tfer), unable to activate mechanisms for iron mobilization and uptake known as "strategy I," and its correspondent wild‚Äêtype T3238FER (TFER). By using different iron concentration in the growth solution, the most suitable iron level to induce phenotypic differences between the two genotypes without being lethal for the mutant was found to be 40 ¬µM Fe‚ÄêNa‚ÄêEDTA. The analyses were carried out also on plants grown with 80 ¬µM Fe‚ÄêNa‚ÄêEDTA, an iron concentration at which the two genotypes showed no phenotypic differences. A significant decrease in total leaf iron and chlorophyll content was detected in both genotypes following reduction of iron concentration in the nutrient solution, and was particularly evident in Tfer40, which showed symptoms of chlorosis. The photo‚Äêelectron transport rate of the whole chain was significantly affected by growth conditions as well as by genotype, the lowest activity being detected in Tfer40 plants. Chlorophyll a fluorescence analysis revealed an increase in non‚Äêphotochemical quenching (q NP) of Tfer plants grown at both iron concentrations, indicating the activation of photoprotective mechanisms, which, however, were not sufficient to prevent photoinhibition when plants were grown at 40 ¬µM iron, as indicated by significant reduction in PSII photochemistry (F v/F m) and photochemical quenching (q P). The actual quantum yield of PSII (Œ¶PSII) and the intrinsic PSII efficiency (Œ¶EXC) showed the same behavior of q P and F v/F m ratio. A significant effect of mutation and iron supply on all the pigments was detected, and was particularly evident in the mutant grown at 40 ¬µM iron. A different behavior was shown by the three pigments involved in the xantophyll cycle, violaxanthin being less affected than chlorophylls and the other carotenoids, and zeaxanthin even increasing, due to the xanthophyll cycle activation. In conclusion, the interaction between iron deprivation and fer mutation induced functional alterations to the photosynthetic apparatus. Anyway, as far as concerns the photo‚Äêelectron transport activity, the influence of fer mutation seemed to occur independently from iron supply. 3aSolanum lycopersicum var. lycopersicum 3achlorophyll 3achlorosis 3aculture media 3afluorescence 3agenotype 3airon 3aleaves 3alutein 3amutagenesis 3amutants 3anutrient content 3anutrient solutions 3aphotochemistry 3aphotoinhibition 3aphotosystem II 3atomatoes 3aviolaxanthin 3azeaxanthin1 aCastagna, Antonella1 aGuidi, Lucia1 aZocchi, Graziano1 aRanieri, Annamaria0 tJournal of plant nutrition.g2003, v. 26, no. 10-11 p.2137-2148dDekkerx0190-41677nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1081/PLN-1200242703Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03221naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119072000900137072000900146100001600155245011900171300001800290500002400308500001500332520153300347650002101880650001601901650001801917650002101935650001901956650001601975650001801991650001502009650000902024650002502033650002402058650002402082650001602106650002202122653001902144653002802163653003202191653003102223700001502254700001502269700001702284700001702301700001802318773016202336852000902498856007702507930003302584945002502617946001302642655001202655IND4380499520221119165415.0060530e20060419xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438049952DNAL7 a10.1021/jf052994o2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aS200 0aX3801 aShimoda, H.10aAnti type I allergic property of Japanese butterbur extract and its mast cell degranulation inhibitory ingredients  ap. 2915-2920.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aPollenosis is a disease that affects 1 in 10 of the Japanese population. During the season of cedar pollen dispersal, many patients suffer from symptoms such as sniffling, sternutation, and itching of the eyes. Japanese butterbur is a popular vegetable and is one of the few domestic vegetables in Japan. The anti type I allergic effects of an aqueous ethanol extract from aerial parts of Japanese butterbur (JBE) were evaluated in rats and RBL-2H3 mast cells. In the passive cutaneous anaphylaxis reaction in rats, a single oral treatment of JBE (1000 mg/kg) was found to suppress the reaction. In IgE-sensitized RBL-2H3 cells, JBE (10-100 microgram/mL) inhibited beta-hexosaminidase release, leukotriene C4/D4/E4 synthesis, and TNF-alpha production. Moreover, a high concentration of JBE (1000 microgram/mL) suppressed smooth muscle constriction induced by histamine (10 micromolar) and leukotriene D4 (10 nM) in a guinea pig trachea strip. The search for components in JBE with an inhibitory activity on mast cell degranulation was guided by inhibition of beta-hexsosaminidase release. Two eremophilane-type sesquiterpenes, six polyphenolic compounds, and two triterpene glycosides were isolated. Of these compounds, fukinolic acid, a principal polyphenol constituent, showed potent inhibitory activity (IC50 value = 2.1 microgram/mL). Consequently, On the basis of its inhibition of mast cell activation and direct smooth muscle reaction induced by released mediators, JBE was found to suppress the type I allergic reaction. 3asesquiterpenoids 3apolyphenols 3aimmunotherapy 3amedicinal plants 3aplant extracts 3aguinea pigs 3atriterpenoids 3amast cells 3arats 3amedicinal properties 3aoral administration 3aPetasites japonicus 3aanaphylaxis 3aprotective effect 0afukinolic acid 0amast cell degranulation 0aimmunosuppression (therapy) 0aimmediate hypersensitivity1 aTanaka, J.1 aYamada, E.1 aMorikawa, T.1 aKasajima, N.1 aYoshikawa, M.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2006 Apr. 19, v. 54, no. 8 p.2915-2920dAmerican Chemical Society, Books and Journals Division]x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf052994o3Available from publisher's Web site  a20060718b20060804c00000000  aINDdRHFe2006/07/18  aOther US 7aarticle03229naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131072000900149072000900158100001300167245017000180300001600350500002400366500001500390520158000405650001601985650001102001650002202012650001002034650002902044650002302073650002202096650001402118650002802132650002302160650001202183650001802195650001702213650000902230650002302239650002202262650001602284650002002300650002502320651001602345653000902361700001502370700001502385773011002400852000902510856007302519930003302592945002502625946001302650655001202663IND4380499120221119165540.0060530e200605  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438049912DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jnutbio.2005.07.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aT300 0aX3801 aPark, S.10aAntecedent intake of traditional Asian-style diets exacerbates pancreatic Œ≤-cell function, growth and survival after Western-style diet feeding in weaning male rats  ap. 307-318.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe prevalence of type 2 diabetes has been rapidly increasing in conjunction with the westernization of diet patterns in Asia. We determined whether the antecedent consumption of traditional Asian-style diets (ADs) deteriorates insulin action, insulin secretion and pancreatic Œ≤-cell mass after subsequent imposition of the diabetogenic challenge of Western-style diets (WDs) in weaning male Sprague-Dawley rats. Rats were provided AD (a low-fat and plant protein diet), WD (a high-fat and animal protein diet) or a control diet (CD) (a low-fat and animal protein diet) for 12 weeks. After 12 weeks, the groups were divided into two subsets; one set of the groups continued to consume their previous diets of WD, AD and CD for another 12 weeks, and the second set was divided into three groups represented by a switch in their designated diets from WD to AD, AD to WD and CD to WD. Whole-body glucose disposal rates and GLUT4 contents in soleus muscles were lower in WD regardless of the antecedent protein sources. The first-phase insulin secretion was higher in the CD group than in the other groups, whereas the second phase was lowered with AD consumption as antecedent and/or present diets. Asian-style diet and AD-WD intake did not compensate for insulin resistance due to the failure of Œ≤-cell expansion via decreased proliferation. These findings suggest that the antecedent consumption of AD possibly accelerates and augments the development of glucose dysregulation via decreased insulin secretion capacity and pancreatic Œ≤-cell mass when the diets switch to WD. 3adietary fat 3aleptin 3atraditional foods 3amales 3adietary nutrient sources 3ainsulin resistance 3ainsulin secretion 3aapoptosis 3aepidemiological studies 3ametabolic syndrome 3aweaning 3aacculturation 3ahypoglycemia 3arats 3acell proliferation 3aglucose tolerance 3afood intake 3adietary protein 3aislets of Langerhans 3aSouth Korea 0adiet1 aPark, C.H.1 aJang, J.S.0 tJournal of nutritional biochemistry.g2006 May, v. 17, no. 5 p.307-318dElsevier Sciencex0955-28637nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jnutbio.2005.07.0023electronic resource  a20060615b20060702c00000000  aINDdPNNe2006/06/15  aOther US 7aarticle03041naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003100092040001800123100001900141245008900160300001800249500002400267520174300291650001502034650002102049650001802070650002202088650002102110650001002131650001502141650001902156650001302175650001802188650002902206650002502235650002202260650001102282650001702293650002002310650000902330700002302339700002102362700002102383773008902404852000902493856008102502655001202583IND4464007820221119165331.0120904s2003    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446400782DNAL7 a10.1081/PLN-1200210572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHill, Wendy J.10aSummer Patch Disease Severity on Kentucky Bluegrass in Response to Fertilizer Source  ap. 1499-1512.  aIncludes references  aSummer patch is caused by the ectotrophic, root‚Äêinfecting fungus Magnaporthe poae Landschoot and Jackson. The disease, which often infects high maintenance turf, can be difficult to control because root infection often occurs six to eight weeks before the appearance of foliar symptoms. Disease severity is reduced when turf is fertilized with ammonium nitrogen (N) sources, compared to nitrate or urea sources of N. Thiosulfate, from (NH4)2S2O3 or K2S2O3, is a nitrification inhibitor which may enhance ammonium uptake of turf by slowing nitrification. N‚ÄêSURE is a triazone‚Äêbased, slow release N source that is commonly used to fertilize turfgrass. Field studies were conducted from 1995 to 1996 on Kentucky bluegrass (Poa pratensis L.) grown on a Nixon loam (fine‚Äêloamy, mixed, mesic Typic Hapludult) to evaluate the effectiveness of the several N and K sources for their ability to control summer patch disease. Nitrogen fertilizers, N‚ÄêSURE, (NH4)2S2O3, and (NH4)2SO4, were applied in combination with either K2SO4 or K2S2O3. The severity of summer patch was greater when the turf was fertilized with N‚ÄêSURE in 1995 and 1996 and urea in 1996 compared to (NH4)2S2O3. The N sources, (NH4)2SO4 and (NH4)2S2O3, were strongly acidifying to the upper 10 cm of soil and were very effective in controlling summer patch. The application of K2S2O3 slightly acidified the upper 5 cm of soil but did not suppress the development of summer patch. The ability of thiosulfate to act as a nitrification inhibitor did not appear to play a role in the suppression of summer patch. Since foliar burn may occur if (NH4)2SO4, (NH4)2S2O3, or K2S2O3 are applied to turf without irrigation, the application of water after their use is recommended. 3aHapludults 3aMagnaporthe poae 3aPoa pratensis 3aammonium nitrogen 3adisease severity 3afungi 3airrigation 3alawns and turf 3anitrates 3anitrification 3anitrification inhibitors 3anitrogen fertilizers 3apotassium sulfate 3asummer 3aturf grasses 3aturf management 3aurea1 aHeckman, Joseph R.1 aClarke, Bruce B.1 aMurphy, James A.0 tJournal of plant nutrition.g2003, v. 26, no. 7 p.1499-1512dDekkerx0190-41677nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1081/PLN-1200210573Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03319naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024003200133040001800165100002300183245007900206300001600285500002400301506007600325520146100401506003701862650002501899650001901924650002301943650002901966650001401995650002002009650002102029650002202050650001102072650002302083650001302106650002402119650002702143650006302170650007102233650004002304650002802344650002802372650002402400650001502424650002902439700002602468700001902494700002002513700002302533773010602556852000902662856008202671655001202753IND4435955820221207104535.0100423e201003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443595582DNAL7 a201975052pmid7 aPMC28614592pmcid7 a10.1105/tpc.109.0737262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKlodmann, Jennifer10aInternal Architecture of Mitochondrial Complex I from Arabidopsis thaliana  ap. 797-810.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe NADH dehydrogenase complex (complex I) of the respiratory chain has unique features in plants. It is the main entrance site for electrons into the respiratory electron transfer chain, has a role in maintaining the redox balance of the entire plant cell and additionally comprises enzymatic side activities essential for other metabolic pathways. Here, we present a proteomic investigation to elucidate its internal structure. Arabidopsis thaliana complex I was purified by a gentle biochemical procedure that includes a cytochrome c-mediated depletion of other respiratory protein complexes. To examine its internal subunit arrangement, isolated complex I was dissected into subcomplexes. Controlled disassembly of the holo complex (1000 kD) by low-concentration SDS treatment produced 10 subcomplexes of 550, 450, 370, 270, 240, 210, 160, 140, 140, and 85 kD. Systematic analyses of subunit composition by mass spectrometry gave insights into subunit arrangement within complex I. Overall, Arabidopsis complex I includes at least 49 subunits, 17 of which are unique to plants. Subunits form subcomplexes analogous to the known functional modules of complex I from heterotrophic eukaryotes (the so-called N-, Q-, and P-modules), but also additional modules, most notably an 85-kD domain including Œ≥-type carbonic anhydrases. Based on topological information for many of its subunits, we present a model of the internal architecture of plant complex I.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aNAD (coenzyme) 3aNADH dehydrogenase 3aelectron transport chain 3aelectrons 3aenzyme activity 3aeukaryotic cells 3amass spectrometry 3amodels 3aplant architecture 3aproteins 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aArabidopsisxchemistry 2aArabidopsis Proteinsxchemistryxisolation & purification. 2aElectron Transport Complex Ixchemistryxisolation & purification. 2aElectrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel 2aMitochondriaxchemistry 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aProteomexchemistry 2aProteomics 2aTandem Mass Spectrometry1 aSunderhaus, Stephanie1 aNimtz, Manfred1 aJ√§nsch, Lothar1 aBraun, Hans Peter.0 tplant cell.g2010 Mar., v. 22, no. 3 p.797-810dAmerican Society of Plant Biologistsx1040-46517nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1105/tpc.109.0737263Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02680naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119072000900137072000900146100001400155245006900169300001800238500002400256520132200280650001601602650001301618650001001631650001501641650001701656650002501673650002801698650001401726650001101740650002401751653001701775700001401792700001401806700001601820700001401836700001401850700001501864773016201879852000902041856007702050930003302127945002502160946001302185655001202198IND4380464220221119165356.0060525e20060322xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438046422DNAL7 a10.1021/jf052431c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ504 0aT3001 aLee, J.H.10aLDL-antioxidant pterocarpans from roots of Glycine max (L.)

Merr. was chromatographed, which yielded 10 flavonoids, including three isoflavones 1-3, five pterocarpans 4-8, one flavonol 9, and one anthocyanidin 10. All isolated compounds were examined for LDL-antioxidant activities using four different assay systems on the basis of Cu(2+)-mediated oxidation. Among them, seven compounds showed potent LDL-antioxidant activities in the thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) assay, the lag time of conjugated diene formation, relative electrophoretic mobility (REM), and fragmentation of apoB-100 on copper-mediated LDL oxidation. Three pterocarpans 4, 6, and 7, never reported as LDL-antioxidant, showed potent activities with IC50 values of 19.8, 0.9, 45.0 micromolar, respectively, in comparison with probucol (IC50 = 5.6 micromolar) as positive control. Interestingly, coumestrol 6 (IC50 = 0.9 micromolar) showed 20 times more activity in the TBARS assay than genistein (IC50 = 30.1 micromolar) and daidzein (IC50 = 21.6 micromolar), representative antioxidants in soybean. Moreover, coumestrol 6 had an extended lag time of 190 min at 3.0 micromolar in measuring conjugated diene formation, while both genistein (120 min) and daidzein (93 min) lag times were extended to less than 120 min at the same concentration. 3aGlycine max 3asoybeans 3aroots 3aflavonoids 3aantioxidants 3aantioxidant activity 3alow density lipoprotein 3aoxidation 3acopper 3adietary supplements 0apterocarpans1 aLee, B.W.1 aKim, J.H.1 aJeong, T.S.1 aKim, M.J.1 aLee, W.S.1 aPark, K.H.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2006 Mar. 22, v. 54, no. 6 p.2057-2063dAmerican Chemical Society, Books and Journals Division]x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf052431c3Available from publisher's Web site  a20060809b20060906c00000000  aINDdRHFe2006/06/28  aOther US 7aarticle02449naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119072001700137072001700154072001700171072001700188100001800205245017700223300001800400500001500418520080400433650001101237650001801248650001701266650001701283650001601300650001201316650004901328650001001377650001101387650001501398650002101413650001701434650001101451650002201462653002001484653002301504653003201527653002501559700002001584700001501604700001401619773010501633852000901738856007701747930003301824945002501857946001301882655001201895IND4371028720221116183736.0050607e20050518xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437102872DNAL7 a10.1021/jf04810022doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

The monitoring of metals in the plants is of great importance for protecting the public from the hazards of possible toxic effects and also for informing the population about the nutritional value of the plants. The concentrations of some toxic and essential metal ions were surveyed in seven medicinal and edible plants from Mali. Dry ashing of the plant material and subsequent use of atomic absorption spectrophotometry were the analytical methodologies used. Iron, manganese, and zinc were found in high concentrations in some of the plants, i.e., 1.4 and 1.5 mg/g iron in Cuminum cyminum and Bombax costatum, respectively, 243 microgram/g manganese in Hibiscus sabdariffa, and 62.8 and 67.1 microgram/g zinc in Spilanthes oleracaea and B. costatum, respectively, whereas cobalt and cadmium were not detected in any of the plant material studied. The other ions detected, Cr, Ni, Pb, and Cu, were present in minor amounts, in the ranges of 2.2-17.2 microgram/g for Cr, 1.6-8.1 microgram/g for Ni, 0.7-5.2 microgram/g for Pb, and 2.4-17.1 microgram/g for Cu. From a toxicological point of view, none of these plants would be harmful for the user by taking in the plant material in the traditional manner, which is preparing an infusion of the plant using amounts not adding up to those necessary to reach a harmful level of the metal ions detected. The plants B. costatum and C. cyminum could be of interest as sources for iron for humans in the case of too low of a level of hemoglobin. 3amedicinal plants 3afood crops 3anutrient content 3atrace elements 3amineral content 3aheavy metals 3afood contamination 3awild foods 3aMali1 aDiallo, D.1 aBye, R.1 aPaulsen, B.S.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2005 Mar. 23, v. 53, no. 6 p.2316-2321x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf040436o3Available from publisher's Web site  a20070724b20070802c00000000  aINDdRHFe2005/06/23  aOther US 7aarticle02065naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119072001700137100001500154245010800169300001800277520094300295650002401238650001401262650001301276650002201289650001801311650002001329650001601349650001001365650001301375650001501388700001401403773010501417852000901522856007701531930003301608945002501641946001301666655001201679IND4370897920221116183905.0050602e20050323xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437089792DNAL7 a10.1021/jf048197s2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Ascorbic acid was separated from oxalate in fruit extracts by HPLC and quantified from absorbance at 245 nm, whereas oxalate was measured enzymatically in the HPLC eluate. Levels of whole fruit mean ascorbic acid in the different genotypes ranged from 98 to 163 mg/100 g of fresh weight (FW), whereas mean oxalate varied between 18 and 45 mg/100 g of FW. Ascorbic acid was highest in the inner and outer pericarp, whereas oxalate was concentrated in the skin, inner pericarp, and seed. Essentially no ascorbic acid was found in the seed. Each tissue clustered separately when the tissue ascorbic acid and oxalate data were normalized to the whole fruit level of ascorbic acid and oxalate in that genotype and plotted against each other, suggesting that oxalate is not a sink for excess ascorbic acid but that oxalate formation is regulated. 3aActinidia chinensis 3akiwifruit 3agenotype 3afruit composition 3aascorbic acid 3avitamin content 3aoxalic acid 3aseeds 3apericarp 3afruit pulp1 aLaing, W.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2005 Mar. 23, v. 53, no. 6 p.2322-2326x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf048197s3Available from publisher's Web site  a20070724b20070802c00000000  aINDdRHFe2005/06/23  aOther US 7aarticle03808naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119072001700137100001500154245009300169300001800262500001500280520255700295650001502852650001002867650001402877650001202891650001402903650001602917650001502933650001502948650002502963650001702988650001703005650002203022653002303044700001903067700001403086773010503100852000903205856007703214930003303291945002503324946001303349655001203362IND4370896220221116183802.0050602e20050323xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437089622DNAL7 a10.1021/jf048456d2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aAdom, K.K.10aPhytochemicals and antioxidant activity of milled fractions of different wheat varieties  ap. 2297-2306.  a2019-12-04  aThe health-promoting effects of whole-grain consumption have been attributed in part to their unique phytochemical contents and profiles that complement those found in fruits and vegetables. Wheat is an important component of the human diet; however, little is known about the phytochemical profiles and total antioxidant activities of milled fractions of different wheat varieties. The objectives of this study were to investigate the distribution of phytochemicals (total phenolics, flavonoids, ferulic acid, and carotenoids) and to determine hydrophilic and lipophilic antioxidant activity in milled fractions (endosperm and bran/germ) of three different wheat varieties, two of which were grown in two environments. Grain samples of each of the wheat varieties were milled into endosperm and bran/germ fractions. Each fraction was extracted and analyzed for total phenolics, ferulic acid, flavonoids, carotenoid contents, and hydrophilic and lipophilic antioxidant activities. Total phenolic content of bran/germ fractions (2867-3120 micromol of gallic acid equiv/100 g) was 15-18-fold higher (p < 0.01) than that of respective endosperm fractions. Ferulic acid content ranged from 1005 to 1130 micromol/100 g in bran/germ fractions and from 15 to 21 micromol/100 g in the endosperm fractions. The bran/germ fraction flavonoid content was 740-940 micromol of catechin equiv/100 g. On average, bran/germ fractions of wheat had 4-fold more lutein, 12-fold more zeaxanthin, and 2-fold more beta-cryptoxanthin than the endosperm fractions. Hydrophilic antioxidant activity of bran/germ samples (7.1-16.4 micromol of vitamin C equiv/g) was 13-27-fold higher than that of the respective endosperm samples. Similarly, lipophilic antioxidant activity was 28-89-fold higher in the bran/germ fractions (1785-4669 nmol of vitamin E equiv/g). Hydrophilic antioxidant activity contribution to the total antioxidant activity (hydrophilic + lipophilic) was >80%. In whole-wheat flour, the bran/germ fraction contributed 83% of the total phenolic content, 79% of the total flavonoid content, 51% of the total lutein, 78% of the total zeaxanthin, 42% of the total beta-cryptoxanthin, 85% of the total hydrophilic antioxidant activity, and 94% of the total lipophilic antioxidant activity. Our results showed that different milled fractions of wheat have different profiles of both hydrophilic and lipophilic phytochemicals. These findings provide information necessary for evaluating contributions to good health and disease prevention from whole-wheat consumption. 3aflavonoids 3awheat 3avarieties 3amilling 3aendosperm 3acarotenoids 3awheat germ 3awheat bran 3aantioxidant activity 3aferulic acid 3aantioxidants 3awhole grain foods 0aphenolic compounds1 aSorrells, M.E.1 aLiu, R.H.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2005 Mar. 23, v. 53, no. 6 p.2297-2306x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf048456d3Available from publisher's Web site  a20070724b20070802c00000000  aINDdRHFe2005/06/23  aOther US 7aarticle02324naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119072001700137072001700154072001700171100001600188245011600204300001800320520112600338650001701464650002501481650002701506650001301533650001901546650002001565650001501585650002401600653001701624653002301641773010501664852000901769856007701778930003301855945002501888946001301913655001201926IND4371127320221116183845.0050609e20050518xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437112732DNAL7 a10.1021/jf050238c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

A modified soil column batch experiment was conducted to measure the transient nature of chlorpyrifos sorption and desorption from Cecil soil. This experimental system minimizes many shortcomings associated with obtaining sorption parameters by fitting soil column data to an advective-dispersive transport equation. Several chlorpyrifos formulations were investigated to determine how formulations affect soil sorption, and if this effect is adequately described using transient sorption/desorption algorithms. Both a second-order sorption with first-order desorption kinetic model and the two-site kinetic/equilibrium model were found to yield reasonable comparisons to experimental observations. In general, the formulation temporarily decreases the sorptivity of chlorpyrifos and alters the time for equilibrium to be achieved. Care must be exercised when extrapolating sorption data for a pure molecule in a laboratory setting to formulated materials used in field applications when environmental fate predictions are sought. 3achlorpyrifos 3ainsecticide residues 3apesticide formulations 3asorption 3asoil pollution 3aclay loam soils 3aalgorithms 3amathematical models 0asoil columns 0akinetic algorithms0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2005 May 18, v. 53, no. 10 p.4103-4109x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf050238c3Available from publisher's Web site  a20050921b00000000c00000000  aINDdRHFe2005/06/24  aOther US 7aarticle02085naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119072001700137100001300154245009100167300001800258520098800276650001301264650002701277650001301304650001601317650001301333650001601346650002601362653002301388653002001411700001801431773010501449852000901554856007701563930003301640945002501673946001301698655001201711IND4371126320221116183709.0050609e20050518xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437112632DNAL7 a10.1021/jf04804002doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aZhao, J.10aLow molecular weight polylactic acid as a matrix for the delayed release of pesticides  ap. 4076-4082.  aLow molecular weight polylactic acid (LMW PLA) was used as a matrix to formulate biodegradable matrix granules and films with bromacil using a melt process. The compatibility of the PLA with bromacil was evaluated. The release characteristics of the formulations were investigated in vitro. The degradation and erosion of the formulations were monitored by pH and gravimetric analysis during the course of release. Various granules and films had similar biphasic release patterns, a delayed release followed by an explosive release. The release rates were independent of bromacil content in the matrix, but varied with the geometry of matrices. The mechanisms of diffusion and erosion were involved in the release. The delayed release of the formulations was dominantly governed by the degradation and erosion of PLA. LMW PLA underwent bulk erosion. LMW PLA-based matrix formulations could thus be useful for the application of pesticides to sensitive targets such as seed treatment. 3abromacil 3apesticide formulations 3apolymers 3alactic acid 3agranules 3adegradation 3apesticide application 0acontrolled release 0adelayed release1 aWilkins, R.M.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2005 May 18, v. 53, no. 10 p.4076-4082x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf04804003Available from publisher's Web site  a20050921b00000000c00000000  aINDdRHFe2005/06/24  aOther US 7aarticle02631naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119072001700137072001700154100001700171245007100188300001800259500001500277520139900292650001801691650001101709650001601720650001601736650002001752650002101772650001401793653002001807653001501827653001001842700001601852700002201868700001901890700001401909773010501923852000902028856007702037930003302114945002502147946001302172655001202185IND4371131620221116183807.0050609e20050518xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437113162DNAL7 a10.1021/jf050061m2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aKaldas, M.I.10aCovalent binding of the flavonoid quercetin to human serum albumin  ap. 4194-4197.  a2019-12-04  aQuercetin is an abundant flavonoid in the human diet with numerous biological activities, which may contribute to the prevention of human disease but also may be potentially harmful. Quercetin is oxidized in cells to products capable of covalently binding to cellular proteins, a process that may be important for its biological activities. In the present study, using radiolabeled drug and quantifying the products after electrophoretic separation, proteins to which oxidized quercetin is binding irreversibly were identified. The binding of quercetin to human serum albumin (HSA) in human blood and the effect of stimulation of neutrophilic myeloperoxidase on this binding were also measured. The in vitro binding of quercetin to eight proteins in the presence of catalytic amounts of horseradish peroxidase and hydrogen peroxide was highly selective for HSA. For all proteins the binding was dramatically decreased by reduced L-glutathione. In the blood samples, the release of neutrophilic myeloperoxidase by phorbol ester caused a 3-fold increase in the binding of quercetin to HSA. This study shows that quercetin in the presence of peroxidase/hydrogen peroxide covalently links to proteins with a particularly high affinity for HSA and that this also may occur in vivo after exposure to quercetin. This provides further insights into the complex behavior of this major dietary flavonoid. 3aserum albumin 3ahumans 3aperoxidases 3aneutrophils 3aenzyme activity 3abinding capacity 3aquercetin 0amyeloperoxidase 0aflavonoids 0ablood1 aWalle, U.K.1 aWoude, H. van der1 aMcMillan, J.M.1 aWalle, T.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2005 May 18, v. 53, no. 10 p.4194-4197x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf050061m3Available from publisher's Web site  a20050921b00000000c00000000  aINDdRHFe2005/06/27  aOther US 7aarticle03040naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119072001700137072001700154100001600171245007900187300001800266500001500284520155700299650002701856650002301883650002001906650001901926650001501945650001601960650001201976650001401988653003102002653001502033653002202048653001302070653001602083653001302099653001202112653001902124653001102143700001702154700001602171700001402187700001802201700001702219773010502236852000902341856007702350930003302427945002502460946001302485655001202498IND4371073320221116183628.0050607e20050518xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437107332DNAL7 a10.1021/jf04047482doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aCarmona, M.10aInfluence of different drying and aging conditions on saffron constituents  ap. 3974-3979.  a2019-12-04  aA dehydration postharvesting treatment is necessary to convert Crocus sativus L. stigmas into saffron spice. Three different dehydration treatments were evaluated: dehydration at room temperature; dehydration with hot air at different temperatures (70, 90, and 110 degrees C); and dehydration following traditional processing in Castille-La Mancha (Spain) with three different heating sources (vineshoot charcoal, gas cooker, and electric coil). The time (between 28 and 55 min) and mean temperature (between 54 and 83 degrees C) conditions for traditional dehydration were established for the first time. The highest coloring strength was obtained when saffron was submitted to higher temperatures and lower times. These findings may be supported by the fact that samples dehydrated at high temperature were more porous than those dehydrated at room temperature, as was observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The higher the temperature during the process, the higher the proportion of trans-crocetin di-(beta-D-gentibiosyl) ester, although trans-crocetin (beta-D-glucosyl)-(beta-D-gentibiosyl) and trans-crocetin di-(beta-D-glucosyl) ester decrease while cis-crocins did not change significantly. A thermal aging process reveals that the trans-crocetin di-(beta-D-gentibiosyl) ester increases when saffron is resubmitted to a heating treatment before it is decomposed by the extreme conditions. The picrocrocin extinction during the aging process does not imply a consistent generation of safranal. 3atraditional technology 3adrying temperature 3afood processing 3adrying quality 3aair drying 3acarotenoids 3asaffron 3aaldehydes 0atraditional drying process 0aterpenoids 0ahot air treatment 0acrocetin 0apicrocrocin 0asafranal 0acrocins 0ahot air drying 0adrying1 aZalacain, A.1 aPardo, J.E.1 aLopez, E.1 aAlvarruiz, A.1 aAlonso, G.L.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2005 May 18, v. 53, no. 10 p.3974-3979x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf04047483Available from publisher's Web site  a20050921b00000000c00000000  aINDdRHFe2005/06/24  aOther US 7aarticle02539naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119072001700137072001700154100001400171245014500185300001800330500001500348520114700363650002501510650001401535650001801549650003001567650001401597650003301611650004801644653002301692653002801715653002501743653002001768700001301788700001501801700001501816773010501831852000901936856007701945930003302022945002502055946001302080655001202093IND4371073120221116183838.0050607e20050518xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437107312DNAL7 a10.1021/jf04825622doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Despite this acceptance and use, little is known of the phylogenetic relationships of the genus. Presently, the neighbor-joining method based on the ITS1, 5.8S rRNA, and ITS2 regions was used to construct a phylogenetic tree of 17 Cordyceps isolates. Five major groups were evident. Cordyceps sinensis was less closely related to 15 Cordyceps species but shared a closer relationship with Cordyceps agriota. PCR-single-stranded conformational polymorphism was applied to differentiate seven Cordyceps isolates: five were different from those used to construct the phylogenetic tree, based on differences in the internal spacer 2 (ITS2). The length of ITS2, amplified by primers 5.8SR and ITS4, vary between 334 and 400 bp. This segment could be used for intraspecies classification or detection of mutations and represents potential novel means of identification of this fungal genus in herbal medicines and in quality control applications in the fermentation industry. 3atraditional medicine 3aCordyceps 3aribosomal DNA 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aphylogeny 3ainternal transcribed spacers 3asingle-stranded conformational polymorphism 0aCordyceps sinensis 0amolecular sequence data 0anucleotide sequences 0amedicinal fungi1 aSu, Y.L.1 aYang, H.L.1 aChen, T.Y.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2005 May 18, v. 53, no. 10 p.3963-3968x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf04825623Available from publisher's Web site  a20050921b00000000c00000000  aINDdRHFe2005/06/24  aOther US 7aarticle02609naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119072001700137100001500154245006500169300001800234520146300252650001601715650001801731650001201749650000701761650001901768650001901787650002201806650001901828650002201847653001801869700001401887700001701901700001901918773010501937852000902042856007702051930003302128945002502161946001302186655001202199IND4370532620221116183811.0050527e20050323xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437053262DNAL7 a10.1021/jf048688c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aLund, M.N.10aKinetics and mechanism of lactosylation of alpha-lactalbumin  ap. 2095-2102.  aThe lactosylation of alpha-lactalbumin in aqueous solution was followed at pH(c) = 6.0, 6.3, 7.0, 7.3, and 7.9 and constant ionic strength (I = 0.080) at 50-60 degrees C by reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) and electrospray mass spectrometry (MS). The rate of the lactosylation reaction increased with increasing pH and with temperature most significantly at lower pH. The rate of lactosylation could be described by an acid dissociation curve corresponding to pK(a) of the epsilon-amino group of lysine in alpha-lactalbumin. From initial rates for conditions of excess of lactose, pseudo-first-order rate constants were calculated and further transferred into second-order rate constants by dividing with the lactose concentration. Second-order rate constants for protonated and unprotonated lysine in alpha-lactalbumin both showed Arrhenius behavior, and using transition-state theory, deltaH(#) = 31 +/- 2 kJ/mol and deltaS(#) = -266 +/- 48 J/(mol . K) were determined for the unprotonated form and deltaH(#) = 158 +/- 49 kJ/mol and deltaS(#) = 80 +/- 150 J/(mol . K) for the protonated form, respectively. On the basis of the marked differences in activation parameters, initial formation of a lactosylamine is suggested as rate-determining for reaction between lactose and a protonated lysine in alpha-lactalbumin, while subsequent water elimination to form a Schiff base becomes rate-determining for the unprotonated form. 3alactalbumin 3aglycosylation 3alactose 3apH 3aionic strength 3afood chemistry 3areaction kinetics 3athermodynamics 3aMaillard reaction 0alactosylation1 aOlsen, K.1 aSorensen, J.1 aSkibsted, L.H.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2005 Mar. 23, v. 53, no. 6 p.2095-2102x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf048688c3Available from publisher's Web site  a20070724b20070802c00000000  aINDdRHFe2005/06/22  aOther US 7aarticle02303naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119072001700137100001800154245009800172300001800270500001500288520102500303650001401328650001501342650001801357650001501375650001401390650002801404650001201432650001801444650002501462653001701487653002301504700001601527700001701543700001801560700001701578773010501595852000901700856007701709930003301786945002501819946001301844655001201857IND4370525720221116183511.0050526e20050323xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437052572DNAL7 a10.1021/jf048386a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aMorello, J.R.10aAntioxidant activity of olive pulp and olive oil phenolic compounds of the Arbequina cultivar  ap. 2002-2008.  a2019-12-04  aThe aim of this study was to characterize antioxidant activities of phenolic compounds that appear in olive pulp and olive oils using both radical scavenging and antioxidant activity tests. Antiradical and antioxidant activities of olive pulp and olive oil phenolic compounds were due mainly to the presence of a 3,4-dihydroxy moiety linked to an aromatic ring, and the effect depended on the polarity of the phenolic compound. Glucosides and more complex phenolics exhibited higher antioxidant activities toward oxidation of liposomes, whereas in bulk lipids aglycons were more potent antioxidants with the exception of oleuropein. Lignans acted as antioxidants only in liposomes, which could partly be due to their chelating activity, because liposome oxidation was initiated by cupric acetate. The antioxidant activity of virgin olive oil is principally due to the dialdehydic form of elenolic acid linked to hydroxytyrosol (3,4-DHPEA-EDA), a secoiridoid derivative (peak RT 36, structure unidentified), and luteolin. 3acultivars 3aolive pulp 3afree radicals 3aoleuropein 3aolive oil 3afree radical scavengers 3alignans 3aOlea europaea 3aantioxidant activity 0asecoiridoids 0aphenolic compounds1 aVuorela, S.1 aRomero, M.P.1 aMotilva, M.J.1 aHeinonen, M.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2005 Mar. 23, v. 53, no. 6 p.2002-2008x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf048386a3Available from publisher's Web site  a20070724b20070802c00000000  aINDdRHFe2005/06/22  aOther US 7aarticle02826naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119072001700137100001400154245008300168300001800251500001500269520138800284650001601672650000901688650001001697650001901707650001101726650001801737650002201755650001701777650002501794650001501819650001401834650003001848653001701878653002901895653002401924653004501948653002301993700001402016700001402030700001402044773010502058852000902163856007702172930003302249945002502282946001302307655001202320IND4370525520221116183547.0050526e20050323xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437052552DNAL7 a10.1021/jf04860402doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aLee, K.W.10aAntiproliferative effects of dietary phenolic substances and hydrogen peroxide  ap. 1990-1995.  a2019-12-04  aThere has been controversy as to whether the antiproliferative activity of dietary phenolic substances on cancer cells is due to the bioactivities of phenolics or the generation of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) in media as an artifact. This study was to investigate whether the formation of H2O2 by different phenolics induces acute toxicity and carcinogenicity in normal rat liver epithelial cells. Gallic acid, one of the major antioxidants present in fruits and vegetables, dose-dependently generated considerably more H2O2 in DMEM media without cells than did quercetin. Gallic acid exerted stronger antiproliferative activity than quercetin on both Caco-2 human colon cancer cells (Caco-2 cells) and WB-F344 normal rat liver epithelial cells (WB cells) cultured in DMEM media, and the effect was partially reduced by catalase. Furthermore, gallic acid (but not quercetin) also inhibited gap-junction intercellular communication (GJIC; a carcinogenic phenomenon), which was in part protected by the addition of catalase. Exogenous H2O2 addition also inhibited the proliferation of both Caco-2 cells and WB cells and inhibited GJIC in a dose-dependent manner, but these effects were almost abolished by the treatment with catalase. From these results it is concluded that the antiproliferative effects of some antioxidants on cancer cells are partially due to their prooxidant actions. 3agallic acid 3arats 3aliver 3aacute toxicity 3ahumans 3agap junctions 3ahydrogen peroxide 3acytotoxicity 3acolorectal neoplasms 3acell lines 3aquercetin 3aanticarcinogenic activity 0aCaco-2 cells 0aantiproliferative effect 0aprooxidant activity 0agap junction intercellular communication 0aphenolic compounds1 aHur, H.J.1 aLee, H.J.1 aLee, C.Y.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2005 Mar. 23, v. 53, no. 6 p.1990-1995x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf04860403Available from publisher's Web site  a20070724b20070802c00000000  aINDdRHFe2005/06/22  aOther US 7aarticle01925naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119072001700137100002400154245014200178300001800320500001500338520059500353650001400948650002300962650002500985650001001010650002101020650002101041650001401062653003701076653002501113653003701138700002501175700002001200700002101220773010501241852000901346856007701355930003301432945002501465946001301490655001201503IND4370532020221116183707.0050527e20050323xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437053202DNAL7 a10.1021/jf048330g2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

The model shows two very different responses: for CO‚ÇÇ concentrations of 400 ppm or lower, the system evolves into an equilibrium state. For CO‚ÇÇ concentrations of 440 ppm or higher, the system starts oscillating between a state with vigorous deep water formation in the Southern Ocean and a state with no deep water formation in the Southern Ocean. The flushing events result in a rapid increase in atmospheric temperatures, degassing of CO‚ÇÇ and therefore an increase in atmospheric CO‚ÇÇ concentrations, and a reduction of sea ice cover in the Southern Ocean. They also cool the deep ocean worldwide. After the flush, the deep ocean warms slowly again and CO‚ÇÇ is taken up by the ocean until the stratification becomes unstable again at high latitudes thousands of years later. The existence of a threshold in CO‚ÇÇ concentration which places the UVic ESCM in either an oscillating or non-oscillating state makes our results intriguing. If the UVic ESCM captures a mechanism that is present and important in the real climate system, the consequences would comprise a rapid increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations of several tens of ppm, an increase in global surface temperature of the order of 1-2¬∞C, local temperature changes of the order of 6¬∞C and a profound change in ocean stratification, deep water temperature and sea ice cover. 3aair temperature 3acarbon dioxide 3aclimate 3aclimate models 3aglobal warming 3aice 3alatitude 3asurface temperature 3awater temperature 0aMillenial-scale oscillations 0aClimate modelling 0aNonlinear behavior of the climate system 0aGlobal warming scenarios1 aEby, Michael 1 aWeaver, Andrew J. 1 aSaenko, Oleg A. 0 tClimate dynamics.g2008 Feb., v. 30, no. 2-3 p.161-174dBerlin/Heidelberg : Springer-Verlagx0930-75757nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00382-007-0279-03Available from publisher's Web site  a20080203b20080301c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02018naa a2200277 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001800152245009500170300001600265500002400281520111400305650000901419650002001428650001801448700002201466700002101488700002501509773013001534852000901664856005501673655001201728IND4444933120221116183023.0101105s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444493312DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1740-8261.2010.01699.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWALLACK, SETH10aCalculation and usage of the thyroid to background ratio on the pertechnetate thyroid scan  ap. 554-560.  aIncludes references  aFeline hyperthyroidism is a common endocrine disorder.

The T:B ratio is a new approach to evaluating the thyroid pertechnetate scan with the intent of identifying which hyperthyroid cats may fail treatment using a standard 148‚ÄÉMBq (4‚ÄÉmCi) ¬π¬≥¬πI dose and which, therefore, require a higher dose. 3acats 3ahyperthyroidism 3athyroid gland1 aMETCALF, MICHELLE1 aSKIDMORE, ANGELA1 aLAMB, CHRISTOPHER R.0 tVeterinary radiology & ultrasound.g2010, v. 51, no. 5 p.554-560dBlackwell Publishing IncwJournal:jnl48671x1058-81837nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1740-8261.2010.01699.x 7aarticle03227naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024003200133040001800165100001900183245013700202300001800339500002400357506007600381520130200457506003701759650003801796650002501834650001601859650001401875650001201889650001001901650001101911650001201922650001201934650001301946650001401959650006101973650007302034650002402107650002602131650002402157650003002181650001302211650002502224650002502249700002302274700002102297700002002318700002502338700002002363700002402383773010902407852000902516856008202525856003002607655001202637IND4385170020221207073307.0061112e200610  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438517002DNAL7 a170282092pmid7 aPMC16266162pmcid7 a10.1105/tpc.105.0376712doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDumez, Sylvain10aMutants of Arabidopsis Lacking Starch Branching Enzyme II Substitute Plastidial Starch Synthesis by Cytoplasmic Maltose Accumulation  ap. 2694-2709.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThree genes, BE1, BE2, and BE3, which potentially encode isoforms of starch branching enzymes, have been found in the genome of Arabidopsis thaliana. Although no impact on starch structure was observed in null be1 mutants, modifications in amylopectin structure analogous to those of other branching enzyme II mutants were detected in be2 and be3. No impact on starch content was found in any of the single mutant lines. Moreover, three double mutant combinations were produced (be1 be2, be1 be3, and be2 be3), and the impact of the mutations on starch content and structure was analyzed. Our results suggest that BE1 has no apparent function for the synthesis of starch in the leaves, as both be1 be2 and be1 be3 double mutants display the same phenotype as be2 and be3 separately. However, starch synthesis was abolished in be2 be3, while high levels of Œ±-maltose were assayed in the cytosol. This result indicates that the functions of both BE2 and BE3, which belong to class II starch branching enzymes, are largely redundant in ARABIDOPSIS: Moreover, we demonstrate that maltose accumulation depends on the presence of an active ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase and that the cytosolic transglucosidase DISPROPORTIONATING ENZYME2, required for maltose metabolization, is specific for Œ≤-maltose.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3a1,4-alpha-glucan branching enzyme 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aamylopectin 3abranching 3acytosol 3agenes 3aleaves 3amaltose 3amutants 3amutation 3aphenotype 2a1,4-alpha-Glucan Branching Enzymexgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aArabidopsisxenzymologyxgeneticsxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aChromatography, Gel 2aCytoplasmxmetabolism 2aMaltosexmetabolism 2aMutagenesis, Insertional. 2aMutation 2aPlastidsxmetabolism 2aStarchxbiosynthesis1 aWattebled, Fabrice1 aDauvillee, David1 aDelvalle, David1 aPlanchot, V√©ronique1 aBall, Steven G.1 aD'Hulst, Christophe0 tplant cell.g2006 Oct., v. 18, no. 10 p.2694-2709dAmerican Society of Plant Biologistsx1040-46517nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1105/tpc.105.0376713Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://www.plantcell.org/ 7aarticle02981naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002300145245006500168300001600233520172100249650001001970650001401980650001701994650002302011650003102034650002302065650001702088650001102105650002102116650001802137650001902155650000902174653003102183653001602214653002702230700002202257700002102279773010902300852000902409856008502418930003302503946001102536655001202547IND4400819320221116183201.0080203e200802  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440081932DNAL7 a10.1007/s11104-007-9503-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKoelbener, Albert 10aCompetition alters plant species response to nickel and zinc  ap. 241-251.  aPhytoextraction can be a cost-efficient method for the remediation of contaminated soils. Using species mixtures instead of monocultures might improve this procedure. In a species mixture, an effect of heavy metals on the species' performance can be modified by the presence of a co-occuring species. We hypothesised that (a) a co-occuring species can change the effect of heavy metals on a target species, and (b) heavy metal application may modifiy the competitive behaviour between the plants. We investigated these mechanisms in a greenhouse experiment using three species to serve as a model system (Carex flava, Centaurea angustifolia and Salix caprea). The species were established in pots of monocultures and mixtures, which were exposed to increasing concentrations of Ni and Zn, ranging from 0 to 2,500 mg/kg. Increased heavy metal application reduced the species' relative growth rate (RGR); the RGR reduction being generally correlated with Ni and Zn concentrations in plant tissue. S. caprea was an exception in that it showed considerable Zn uptake but only moderate growth reduction. In two out of six cases, competitors significantly modified the influence of heavy metals on a target species. The interaction can be explained by an increased uptake of Zn by one species (in this case S. caprea) that reduced the negative heavy metal effect on a target species (C. flava). In two further cases, increasing heavy metal application also altered competitive effects between the species. The mechanisms demonstrated in this experiment could be of relevance for the phytoextraction of heavy metals. The total uptake of metals might be maximised in specific mixtures, making phytoextraction more efficient. 3aCarex 3aCentaurea 3aSalix caprea 3acost effectiveness 3agreenhouse experimentation 3agrowth retardation 3aheavy metals 3anickel 3aphytoremediation 3aplant tissues 3apolluted soils 3azinc 0aAccumulation and tolerance 0aCarex flava 0aCentaurea angustifolia1 aRamseier, Dieter 1 aSuter, Matthias 0 tPlant and soil.g2008 Feb., v. 303, no. 1-2 p.241-251dDordrecht : Springer Netherlandsx0032-079X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11104-007-9503-23Available from publisher's Web site  a20080203b20080301c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03298naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100002600171245010600197300001800303520155100321650002201872650001501894650001201909650001201921650001401933650002201947650001201969650001001981650002101991650001902012650001402031650001402045650001202059650002102071650001902092650001602111650001202127650003802139650001102177650000902188650004202197650002802239650002802267653001302295653002302308653002002331700002102351700001902372700002602391700001702417773011702434852000902551856009202560930003302652946001102685655001202696IND4406989320221116183113.0080620e200807  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440698932DNAL7 a185226932pmid7 a10.1111/j.1365-294X.2008.03812.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHADDRILL, PENELOPE R.10aFemale multiple mating in wild and laboratory populations of the two-spot ladybird, Adalia bipunctata  ap. 3189-3197.  aFemale mating rate is an important variable for understanding the role of females in the evolution of mating systems. Polyandry influences patterns of sexual selection and has implications for sexual conflict over mating, as well as for wider issues such as patterns of gene flow and levels of genetic diversity. Despite this, remarkably few studies of insects have provided detailed estimates of polyandry in the wild. Here we combine behavioural and molecular genetic data to assess female mating frequency in wild populations of the two-spot ladybird, Adalia bipunctata (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae). We also explore patterns of sperm use in a controlled laboratory environment to examine how sperm from multiple males is used over time by females, to link mating with fertilization. We confirm that females are highly polyandrous in the wild, both in terms of population mating rates (~20% of the population found in copula at any given time) and the number of males siring offspring in a single clutch (three to four males, on average). These patterns are consistent across two study populations. Patterns of sperm use in the laboratory show that the number of mates does not exceed the number of fathers, suggesting that females have little postcopulatory influence on paternity. Instead, longer copulations result in higher paternity for males, probably due to the transfer of larger numbers of sperm in multiple spermatophores. Our results emphasize the importance of combining field and laboratory data to explore mating rates in the wild. 3aAdalia bipunctata 3acopulation 3afathers 3afemales 3agene flow 3agenetic variation 3ainsects 3amales 3amating frequency 3amating systems 3apaternity 3apolyandry 3aprogeny 3asexual selection 3aspermatophores 3aspermatozoa 2aAnimals 2aColeopteraxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aFemale 2aMale 2aMating Preference, Animalxphysiology 2aSexual Behavior, Animal 2aSpermatozoaxphysiology 0aladybird 0apaternity analysis 0asexual conflict1 aShuker, David M.1 aAmos, William.1 aMAJERUS, MICHAEL E.N.1 aMayes, Sean.0 tMolecular ecology.g2008 July, v. 17, no. 13 p.3189-3197dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0962-10837nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-294X.2008.03812.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20080620b20080704c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01845naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003200092040001800124100002400142245012000166300001800286500002400304520092300328650001301251650001201264650002001276650001301296650001001309650001101319650000901330700002401339773011401363852000901477856004501486655001201531IND4410499420221116183612.0080919e200809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441049942DNAL7 a10.1002/mnfr.2007001482doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSteward, William P.10aCurcumin in cancer management: Recent results of analogue design and clinical studies and desirable future research  ap. 1005-1009.  aIncludes references  aThe ability of the curry constituent curcumin to delay the onset of cancer has been the topic of extensive research for many years. Abundant literature is devoted to mechanisms by which curcumin may mediate this activity. These insights have prompted investigations in which curcumin as lead molecule serves as a scaffold for synthetic chemical attempts to optimize pharmacological potency. Among the published analogues with notable efficacy are dimethylcurcumin, 1,5-bis(3-pyridyl)-1,4-pentadien-3-one and 3,5-bis-(2-fluorobenzylidene)-piperidinium-4-one acetate. Results of a small number of clinical pilot studies conducted with curcumin at doses of up to 12 g suggest tentatively that it is safe in humans. Prevention of adenoma recurrence constitutes a clinical paradigm worthy of further investigation for curcumin. Future clinical study should include measurement of mechanism-based pharmacodynamic parameters. 3aacetates 3aadenoma 3aclinical trials 3acurcumin 3acurry 3ahumans 3alead1 aGescher, Andreas J.0 tMolecular nutrition & food research.g2008 Sept., v. 52, no. 9 p.1005-1009dWiley-VCH Verlagx1613-41257nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/mnfr.200700148 7aarticle03392naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001700145245009100162300001600253500002400269520200100293650002002294650002802314650002302342650002002365650001102385650001702396650001202413650001902425650002002444650001002464650001102474650001902485650001202504650002402516650001902540650001702559650001102576650001702587650001102604651001102615700001702626700002202643700001302665700002702678700001502705773009702720852000902817856004802826655001202874IND4418357520221116183253.0090327e200904  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441835752DNAL7 a10.1007/s10584-008-9493-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSmith, W.

In this study we assessed the impact that climate change scenarios may have on soil carbon stocks in Canada and examined the potential for agricultural management practices to improve or maintain soil quality. Historical weather data from 1951 to 2001 indicated that semi-arid soils in western Canada have become warmer and dryer and air temperatures have increased during the spring and winter months. Results from the Canadian Center for Climate Modelling and Analysis (CCCma) Coupled Global Climate Model (CGCM1,2) under two climate change forcing scenarios also indicated that future temperatures would increase more in the spring and winter. Precipitation increased significantly under the IPCC IS92a scenario and agreed with historical trends in eastern Canada whereas the IPCC SRES B2 scenario indicated very little change in precipitation and better matched historical trends in western Canada. The Century model was used to examine the influence of climate change on agricultural soil carbon (C) stocks in Canada. Relative to simulations using historical weather data, model results under the SRES B2 climate scenario indicated that agricultural soils would lose 160 Tg of carbon by 2099 and under the IS92a scenario would lose 53 Tg C. Carbon was still lost from soils in humid climatic regions even though C inputs from crops increased by 10-13%. Carbon factors associated with changes in management practices were also estimated under both climate change scenarios. There was little difference in factors associated with conversion from conventional to no-till agriculture, while carbon factors associated with the conversion of annual crops to perennial grass were lower than for historical data in semi-arid soils because water stress hampered crop production but were higher in humid soils. 3aadverse effects 3aagricultural management 3aagricultural soils 3aair temperature 3acarbon 3acarbon sinks 3aclimate 3aclimate models 3acrop production 3acrops 3adryers 3aglobal warming 3agrasses 3ameteorological data 3asemiarid soils 3asoil quality 3aspring 3awater stress 3awinter 3aCanada1 aGrant, B.

These experiments are based on systems research and characterized by their focus on production methods, whole food testing and procedures in accordance with the terms of organic farming. A short review of such experiments shows that the majority of these tests revealed effects of the organically produced feed on health parameters such as reproductive performance and immune responses. Systems research is not just about simple cause-effect chains, but rather about the pluralism of interactions in biological networks; therefore, the interpretation of the outcome of whole food experiments is difficult. Furthermore, the test diets of organic and conventional origin can be constituted in different ways, compensating for or maintaining existing differences in nutrient and energy contents. The science-based results suggest positive influences from organic feeds, but there is still a need for confirmation in animals and, finally, in humans. For this purpose animal feeding trials with feed from different production systems should be conducted, with the aims to define health indicators and to establish biomarkers as a basis for future dietary intervention studies in humans. 3aenergy content 3adiet 3anutrient content 3ahumans 3abiomarkers 3afecundity 3anutritive value 3aanimal models 3aimmune response 3aorganic foods 3ahealth foods 2aAgriculturexmethods 2aAnimals 2aDiet 2aFood Preferences 2aHealth Foodxstandards 2aHumans 2aNutritional Sciences 2aNutritive Value 0afoods 0aliterature reviews 0afood quality 0aagricultural products1 aHuber, Machteld1 aLauridsen, Charlotte1 aRembia≈Çkowska, Ewa1 aSeidel, Kathrin1 aB√ºgel, Susanne0 tJournal of the science of food and agriculture.g2010 Jan. 30, v. 90, no. 2 p.175-182dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.x0022-51427nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jsfa.38053Available from publisher's Web site  a20100220b20100305c00000000  aINDd2CTe2010/02/02  aNon-US 7aarticle03062naa a2200613 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127072000900145072000900154072000900163072000900172072000900181100001700190245008900207300001600296500002400312500001500336520132700351650002301678650001501701650002601716650002801742650001901770650002001789650002601809650001101835650001201846650001301858650001901871650001001890650002101900650001301921650002601934650001901960650001701979650002001996650001502016651001202031653002502043700002602068700002802094700001702122700002002139773011402159852000902273856008502282930003302367945002502400946001102425655001202436IND4429956620221116183207.0091211e201001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442995662DNAL7 a10.1007/s10705-009-9277-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aJ800 0aF500 0aJ500 0aW000 0aJ1001 aR√§ty, Mari 10aPhosphorus and nitrogen cycles in the vegetation of differently managed buffer zones  ap. 121-132.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aVegetated buffer zones (BZs) between a cultivated field and a watercourse reduce erosion and load of particle-bound phosphorus (P), but decay of abundant vegetation increases the potential of BZs to act as a source of readily algal-available P. To quantify temporal variations in P and nitrogen (N) contents of the grassy vegetation of BZs on a clay soil (Vertic Cambisol) in south-western Finland, plant samples were collected six times between May 2005 and April 2006 from natural BZs, BZs grazed by cattle and BZs harvested by cutting and removal of the yield. The total dry weight biomass peaked in early August at 2,130-2,360 and 5,500-6,270 kg ha‚Åª¬π for the grazed and the other BZs, respectively. In August, 3,840-4,830 kg ha‚Åª¬π were removed from the harvested BZs while the entire biomass of the non-harvested BZs remained in the field. In October, total P and N contents varied from 2.4-10.2 to 19-72 kg ha‚Åª¬π, respectively, the lowest amounts being for the young harvested BZ and the highest for the non-harvested BZs. A considerable decrease of P and N contents occurred in the biomass up to 6.1 and almost 30 kg ha‚Åª¬π, respectively, after the first frosts. Harvesting of BZs is recommended to decrease the amount of P and N in the BZs and reduce the risk of P and N leaching outside the growing season. 3aseasonal variation 3aphosphorus 3abiogeochemical cycles 3adry matter accumulation 3asoil fertility 3aplant nutrition 3abotanical composition 3acattle 3acutting 3aleaching 3aeutrophication 3afrost 3ariparian buffers 3anitrogen 3anutrient availability 3agrowing season 3asoil erosion 3aland management 3avegetation 3aFinland 0aconservation buffers1 aUusi-K√§mpp√§, Jaana 1 aYli-Halla, M.q(Markku)1 aRasa, Kimmo 1 aPietola, Liisa 0 tNutrient cycling in agroecosystems.g2010 Jan., v. 86, no. 1 p.121-132dSpringer Netherlandsx1385-13147nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10705-009-9277-43Available from publisher's Web site  a20100317b20100403c00000000  aINDd2CTe2010/02/12  aNon-US 7aarticle03808naa a2200745 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002700111040001800138072000900156100002300165245010700188300001600295500002400311500001500335520153400350650002301884650002101907650002101928650001801949650001701967650001501984650001601999650002802015650001802043650000902061650002802070650002502098650001202123650002302135650002802158650004202186650003002228650001802258650002002276650001602296650003902312650001802351650000902369650004402378650003402422650000902456650002502465650004002490653000902530653001902539653001902558700002402577700002302601700001902624700002202643700002302665700003102688700001802719700002602737773013202763852000902895856007702904930003302981945002503014946001103039655001203050IND4429969120221116183248.0091211e20100130xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442996912DNAL7 a203550382pmid7 a10.1002/jsfa.38032doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aT3001 aRoohinejad, Shahin10aEffect of pre-germination time of brown rice on serum cholesterol levels of hypercholesterolaemic rats  ap. 245-251.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aBACKGROUND: Brown rice is unpolished rice with immeasurable benefits for human health. Brown rice (BR) and pre-germinated brown rice (PGBR) are known to contain various functional compounds such as Œ≥-oryzanol, dietary fibre and Œ≥-aminobutyric acid (GABA). In the present study, the experimental diets containing BR and PGBR (24, 48 h pre-germination) were used to investigate the influence of pre-germination time of brown rice on blood cholesterol in Sprague-Dawley male rats.RESULTS: Hypercholesterolaemia and elevation of LDL-cholesterol were successfully ameliorated by the experimental diets containing BR and PGBR (24 and 48 h pre-germination). As compared to the control sample, the pre-germination time had a significant (P < 0.05) effect on blood cholesterol of Sprague-Dawley male rats. It was also found that the significantly (P < 0.05) better effect on lipid profile of hypercholesterolaemic rats was observed by prolonging the pre-germination time. As compared to non-germinated brown rice, the germinated brown rice showed the higher cardio-protective effect on hypercholesterolaemic Sprague-Dawley male rats.CONCLUSION: The present study suggests that the changes of blood cholesterol can be mainly modulated by using the PGBR rather than BR. The prolonging of pre-germination time led to an increase in the bioactive components, thereby providing a more efficient functional diet affecting the high blood cholesterol. This study suggests that PGBR can be used instead of BR and polished rice in the human diet. 3atemporal variation 3aseed germination 3afunctional foods 3adietary fiber 3ablood lipids 3abrown rice 3acholesterol 3alow density lipoprotein 3aanimal models 3arats 3agamma-aminobutyric acid 3ahypercholesterolemia 2aAnimals 2aCholesterolxblood 2aCholesterol, LDLxblood 2aDietary Fatsxadministration & dosage 2aDietary Fiberxmetabolism 2aFood Handling 2aFunctional Food 2aGermination 2aHypercholesterolemiaxdiet therapy 2aLipidsxblood 2aMale 2aOryzaxchemistryxgrowth & development. 2aPhenylpropionatesxmetabolism 2aRats 2aRats, Sprague-Dawley 2agamma-Aminobutyric Acidxmetabolism 0adiet 0agrain products 0agamma-oryzanol1 aOmidizadeh, Alireza1 aMirhosseini, Hamed1 aSaari, Nazamid1 aMustafa, Shuhaimi1 aMohd Yusof, Rokiah1 aMeor Hussin, Anis Shobirin1 aHamid, Azizah1 aAbd Manap, Mohd Yazid0 tJournal of the science of food and agriculture.g2010 Jan. 30, v. 90, no. 2 p.245-251dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.x0022-51427nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jsfa.38033Available from publisher's Web site  a20100220b20100305c00000000  aINDd2CTe2010/02/02  aNon-US 7aarticle02178naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127072000900145072000900154100001100163245007500174300001600249500002400265520097700289650001701266650001601283650001601299650001601315650002401331650001801355650002001373650001001393650001301403653001501416653001801431700001801449700001501467773009901482852000901581856008501590930003301675945002501708946001101733655001201744IND4430024720221116183605.0091216e200911  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443002472DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcs.2009.07.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ104 0aQ5041 aYi, J.10aProperties of bread made from frozen dough containing waxy wheat flour  ap. 364-369.  aIncludes references  aThe quality of bread made from frozen dough is diminished, and staling rate is increased by changes that occur during freezing and storage. New cultivars of waxy wheat flour (WWF), containing higher levels of amylopectin, may help improve the quality of baked products. Bread quality and staling were investigated for bread containing 0‚Äì45% WWF and 55‚Äì65% water after freezing and 90-day frozen storage. The specific volume was highest with 15% WWF substitution and 60% water in bread made from both unfrozen and frozen dough. With higher levels of WWF and lower water content, bread staling rates decreased. Bread with higher levels of WWF were darker and had greater color variation. 1H NMR studies showed that bread with greater WWF and water had higher transverse relaxation (T2) times (9‚Äì11 ms), but less change in T2 during storage. This research demonstrated that specific combinations of WWF and water produced a better quality of bread after dough freezing. 3afrozen dough 3awheat flour 3aamylopectin 3abreadmaking 3abreadmaking quality 3awater content 3astorage quality 3acolor 3afirmness 0awaxy wheat 0abread staling1 aJohnson, J.W.1 aKerr, W.L.0 tJournal of cereal science.g2009 Nov., v. 50, no. 3 p.364-369dAcademic Pressx0733-52107nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcs.2009.07.0023Available from publisher's Web site  a20100115b20100205c00000000  aINDdRHFe2010/01/14  aNon-US 7aarticle02718naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127072000900145072000900154100001700163245013400180300001600314500002400330520119800354650002501552650003101577650002201608650001001630650002401640650001401664650001801678650002401696650002701720650001601747653001901763653003601782653003801818700002101856700002201877700002101899700001901920700002301939773009901962852000902061856008502070930003302155945002502188946001102213655001202224IND4430024620221116183717.0091216e200911  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443002462DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcs.2009.06.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ104 0aF2001 aGarg, Monika10aAgropyron elongatum HMW-glutenins have a potential to improve wheat end-product quality through targeted chromosome introgression  ap. 358-363.  aIncludes references  aAfter screening of 177 disomic addition lines (DALs) of wheat (Triticum aestivum) containing a pair of chromosomes from different alien species, we found that the chromosome 1E addition line of Agropyron elongatum, that is known to be a potential genetic resource for drought and salinity tolerance, showed potential for improvement of bread-making quality of wheat. This was indicated by increased SDS sedimentation, specific sedimentation, mixograph peak time and SE-HPLC analysis of polymeric proteins. This addition line spontaneously gave rise to a substitution line for chromosome 1D in subsequent generations that showed weak dough strength. Analysis of the x-type HMW-glutenin subunit sequence of Ag. elongatum from DAL1E indicated that it closely resembled the x-type sequence of the A and B genomes of wheat, and the y-type was intermediate between x- and y-type HMW-glutenin subunit genes. From these observations, it was inferred that 1E-encoded seed storage proteins have considerable potential for improvement of wheat end-product quality if transferred to specific chromosomes such as 1A of Chinese Spring (CS) wheat, which has a negative overall effect on bread-making quality. 3aThinopyrum elongatum 3aintergeneric hybridization 3aTriticum aestivum 3awheat 3achromosome addition 3aglutenins 3aintrogression 3abreadmaking quality 3arheological properties 3abread dough 0aaddition lines 0ahigh molecular weight glutenins 0atargeted chromosome introgression1 aTanaka, Hiroyuki1 aIshikawa, Naoyuki1 aTakata, Kanenori1 aYanaka, Mikiko1 aTsujimoto, Hisashi0 tJournal of cereal science.g2009 Nov., v. 50, no. 3 p.358-363dAcademic Pressx0733-52107nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcs.2009.06.0123Available from publisher's Web site  a20100115b20100205c00000000  aINDdRHFe2010/01/14  aNon-US 7aarticle02121naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110100001500127245016900142300001600311520099000327650001501317650001801332650001601350650003001366650001801396653003001414653004001444700001501484700001501499700001501514700001401529773013801543852000901681930003301690945002501723946001101748655001201759IND4365378220221116183747.0041103e20041015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436537822DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

The primer set, comprising of seven specific and two conserved primers, was derived from the integrated sequences of 16S and 23S rRNA genes and their rRNA intergenic spacer region of each species. It was able to identify the seven target species with 93.6% accuracy, which exceeds that of the general biochemical methods. The phylogenetic analyses, using 16S rDNA sequences of the probiotic isolates, also provided further support that the results from the multiplex PCR assay were trustworthy. Taken together, we suggest that the multiplex primer set is an efficient tool for simple, rapid and reliable identification of seven Lactobacillus species. 3aprobiotics 3aribosomal RNA 3aDNA primers 3apolymerase chain reaction 3arapid methods 0aintergenic spacer regions 0amultiplex polymerase chain reaction1 aYang, E.H.1 aYeon, S.W.1 aKang, B.H.1 aKim, T.Y.0 tFEMS microbiology letters.g2004 Oct. 15, v. 239, no. 2 p.267-275aFederation of European Microbiological Societies.x0378-10977nnas  aDNAL  a20041108b20041201c00000000  aINDdGHKe2004/11/08  aNon-US 7aarticle01999naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127072000900145072000900154100001900163245005900182300001600241500005700257500002400314500001500338520071900353650001701072650001201089650002401101650001501125650001901140650001201159650001201171650001001183653002701193653003101220653001501251653002501266773009901291852000901390856008501399930003301484945002501517946001101542655001201553IND4430024520221116183547.0091216e200911  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443002452DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcs.2009.03.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ124 0aQ5041 aBamforth, C.W.10aCurrent perspectives on the role of enzymes in brewing  ap. 353-357.  aIn the special section: Enzymes in grain processing.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe brewing of beer is a very traditional process, based upon a complex endogenous enzymology occurring during the malting of grain, mashing of grist and fermentation. The relevant cereal-derived enzymes that are involved are reviewed. It is likely that the production of alcoholic beverages in breweries in the projected future will assume different paradigms, procedures which are already realistic for the production of flavoured alcoholic beverages (malternatives) and ‚Äúnear-beer‚Äù drinks (happoshu and other beer-like beverages) in Japan. A range of exogenous enzymes‚Äîsuch as glucanases, acetolactate decarboxylase and prolyl endopeptidase‚Äîare available for enhancement of the existing brewing process. 3aglycosidases 3amashing 3aenzymatic treatment 3apeptidases 3acarboxy-lyases 3abrewing 3amalting 3abeers 0aO-glycoside hydrolases 0aacetolactate decarboxylase 0aglucanases 0aprolyl endopeptidase0 tJournal of cereal science.g2009 Nov., v. 50, no. 3 p.353-357dAcademic Pressx0733-52107nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcs.2009.03.0013Available from publisher's Web site  a20100115b20100205c00000000  aINDdRHFe2010/01/14  aNon-US 7aarticle02461naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127072000900145072000900154100002200163245006100185300001600246500005700262500002400319520100100343650001801344650001401362650001401376650003201390650002001422650002501442650001701467653003001484653002701514653002701541653001801568700002201586700001701608700002101625700002501646700001401671700002001685773009901705852000901804856008501813930003301898945002501931946001101956655001201967IND4430024020221116183527.0091216e200911  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443002402DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcs.2009.07.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF600 0aX3501 aHinz, Sandra W.A.10aHemicellulase production in Chrysosporium lucknowense C1  ap. 318-323.  aIn the special section: Enzymes in grain processing.  aIncludes references  aFilamentous fungi are widely used for enzyme production for the biofuel industry. The ascomycetous fungus Chrysosporium lucknowense C1 was isolated as a natural producer of neutral cellulases. It is at present an attractive alternative to well known fungi like Aspergillus sp. and Trichoderma reesei for protein production on a commercial scale. Besides many cellulases, a large number of hemicellulases (particularly xylanases and arabinofuranosidases) and esterases (acetyl xylan esterases and ferulic acid esterases) encoding genes have also been identified in the C1 genome. Many of these extracellular enzymes have been selectively expressed in C1 and then purified and characterized. Four arabinofuranosidases, two acetyl xylan esterases, two ferulic acid esterases, an Œ±-glucuronidase and four xylanases have been purified and characterized. All these enzymes were found to be active towards arabinoxylans, demonstrating the high potential of C1 as a producer of hemicellulolytic enzymes. 3aChrysosporium 3aesterases 3axylanases 3aalpha-N-arabinofuranosidase 3aenzyme activity 3aenzymatic hydrolysis 3aarabinoxylan 0aChrysosporium lucknowense 0aacetyl xylan esterases 0aferulic acid esterases 0ahemicellulase1 aPouvreau, Laurice1 aJoosten, Rob1 aBartels, Jeffrey1 aJonathan, Meliana C.1 aWery, Jan1 aSchols, Henk A.0 tJournal of cereal science.g2009 Nov., v. 50, no. 3 p.318-323dAcademic Pressx0733-52107nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcs.2009.07.0053Available from publisher's Web site  a20100115b20100205c00000000  aINDdRHFe2010/01/14  aNon-US 7aarticle03126naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119072001700137072001700154100002200171245011000193300001800303500001500321520137000336650002101706650002201727650002001749650003101769650001701800650001301817650001101830650003401841650003101875650002601906650001401932650001101946650003201957650001101989650002202000650002202022650001902044650002402063650001402087650001902101650002102120650001302141653000802154700001702162700001902179700001302198700001902211700002002230773010502250852000902355856007702364930003302441945002502474946001302499655001202512IND4371816820221116183552.0050627e20050601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437181682DNAL7 a10.1021/jf05028552doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Burm.] and Marumi kumquat [Fortunella japonica (Thunb.) Swing.] and leaf protoplasts of Marumi kumquat. Ploidy and origins of the nuclear, chloroplastic, and mitochondrial genomes were investigated by flow cytometry and nuclear and cytoplasmic simple sequence repeat analyses. Volatile compounds were extracted from the leaves of the three cybrids by a pentane/ether (1:1) mixture, analyzed by GC-MS, and compared to those of their parents. The cybrids were found to be very close to their nucleus-giving parent, suggesting that the main information for volatile compounds biosynthesis is contained in the nucleus. However, nucleo-cytoplasmic interactions occurred: the (mandarin + lemon) cybrid, possessing nucleus and chloroplasts of lemon and mitochondria from mandarin, synthesizes more monoterpene alcohols and esters than its nucleus-giving parent; the (clementine + kumquat) cybrid, possessing nucleus from kumquat and organelles from mandarin, synthesizes more monoterpene and sesquiterpene hydrocarbons and sesquiterpene alcohols than its nucleus-giving parent. 3asesquiterpenoids 3amitochondrial DNA 3achloroplast DNA 3avolatile organic compounds 3aCitrus limon 3aalcohols 3alemons 3anucleocytoplasmic interaction 3aintergeneric hybridization 3asomatic hybridization 3amandarins 3aesters 3ainterspecific hybridization 3aleaves 3aprotoplast fusion 3aCitrus clementina 3anuclear genome 3aFortunella japonica 3aemissions 3amonoterpenoids 3aCitrus deliciosa 3akumquats 0aDNA1 aGancel, A.L.1 aFroelicher, Y.1 aLuro, F.1 aOllitrault, P.1 aBrillouet, J.M.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2005 June 1, v. 53, no. 11 p.4517-4523x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf05028553Available from publisher's Web site  a20050902b00000000c00000000  aINDdRHFe2005/07/07  aOther US 7aarticle02362naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119072001700137100001900154245006700173300001800240520118200258650002001440650001001460650001401470650001401484650001201498650004901510650001701559650001801576650001901594653002201613653001901635700002001654700001601674773010501690852000901795856007701804930003301881945002501914946001301939655001201952IND4371815420221116183607.0050627e20050601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437181542DNAL7 a10.1021/jf050129y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aArboleya, J.C.10aDensity and microviscosity studies of palm oil/water emulsions  ap. 4448-4453.  aElectron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and densitometry were used to measure the temperature- and rate-dependent formation of fat crystals in emulsion droplets in hardened palm kernel oil in water emulsions. The solid fat content in emulsions can be critical for the functionality of the emulsions in a wide variety of applications. Therefore, new and accessible methods are needed to monitor solid fat content in order to control the functional properties of these emulsions. EPR measurements showed that the microviscosity within the oil droplets could be measured as a function of temperature and that the storage temperature below the main fat melting point is crucial for an increase in the microviscosity, due to fat solidification. The microviscosity of the oil droplets could be an important parameter for defining functional performance (e.g., rheology and partial coalescence). Density measurements provided a simple and accurate method for monitoring changes in phase state of the oil. The phase behavior agreed well with the EPR results, demonstrating that accurate density measurements could prove to be a valuable tool for monitoring fat crystallization processes. 3apalm kernel oil 3awater 3aemulsions 3aviscosity 3adensity 3aelectron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy 3adensitometry 3alipid content 3afood chemistry 0asolid fat content 0amicroviscosity1 aSutcliffe, L.H.1 aWilde, P.J.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2005 June 1, v. 53, no. 11 p.4448-4453x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf050129y3Available from publisher's Web site  a20050902b00000000c00000000  aINDdRHFe2005/07/07  aOther US 7aarticle02811naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119072001700137072001700154072001700171100001900188245014400207300001800351520132700369650003301696650001201729650002601741650002601767650001701793650001801810650002001828650002301848650002201871650002301893650002601916650001401942650002301956700002201979700002202001700002202023700002202045773010502067852000902172856007702181930003302258945002502291946001302316655001202329IND4371816020221116183739.0050627e20050601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437181602DNAL7 a10.1021/jf047848h2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Lettuce plants were sprayed four times with a homogeneous 0.2% aqueous solution of Folicur Combi (wettable powder containing 40% dichlofluanid and 10% tebuconazole) at a rate of 2500 g/ha. Samples were collected 1, 5, and 9 days after the first two applications and at times ranging from 1 to 27 days after the last two applications. All samples were stored in a refrigerator at 4 degrees C. Fungicide levels were determined by solid-liquid extraction (SLE) followed by gas chromatography and mass spectrometry detection (GC-MSD). Recovery was good for tebuconazole (98%) but low for dichlofluanid (29%); precision was good (<10% for both analytes), and quantification limits were low (<1.5 mg/kg). Seven days after the last application, dichlofluanid levels were below the maximum allowed limit established in Spain (10 mg/kg), but tebuconazole levels were above the corresponding limit (5 mg/kg). Tebuconazole concentration dynamics was accurately fitted by zeroth- or combined first- and zeroth-order models (depending on variety), but modeling of the behavior of dichlofluanid was less satisfactory, probably due to its instability. 3aLactuca sativa var. capitata 3alettuce 3agreenhouse production 3apesticide application 3atebuconazole 3adichlofluanid 3afoliar spraying 3agas chromatography 3amass spectrometry 3afungicide residues 3apesticide persistence 3ahalf life 3afood contamination1 aArias-Estevez, M.1 aLopez-Periago, E.1 aCancho-Grande, B.1 aSimal-Gandara, J.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2005 June 1, v. 53, no. 11 p.4471-4475x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf047848h3Available from publisher's Web site  a20050902b00000000c00000000  aINDdRHFe2005/07/07  aOther US 7aarticle02373naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119072001700137100001800154245014600172300001800318500001500336520098900351650002501340650001601365650002601381650001701407650002601424650003301450650003101483650001401514650002701528653004301555653003301598700001401631700001701645700001501662773010501677852000901782856007701791930003301868945002501901946001301926655001201939IND4371815720221116183541.0050627e20050601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437181572DNAL7 a10.1021/jf050303i2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Samples from a commercial fishmeal factory (n = 60) were scanned in the NIR region (1100-2500 nm) in a monochromator instrument in reflectance. Principal component analysis (PCA), dummy partial least-squares regression (DPLS), and linear discriminant analysis (LDA) based on PCA scores were used to identify the origin of fishmeal produced using different fish species. Cross-validation was used as validation method when classification models were developed. DPLS correctly classified 80 and 82% of the fishmeal samples. LDA calibration models correctly classified >80% of fishmeal samples according to fish species The results demonstrated the usefulness of NIR spectra combined with chemometrics as an objective and rapid method for the authentication and identification of fish species used to manufacture the fishmeal. 3aproduct authenticity 3amarine fish 3adiscriminant analysis 3afeed quality 3aproduct certification 3aprincipal component analysis 3anear-infrared spectroscopy 3afish meal 3anondestructive methods 0anear-infrared reflectance spectroscopy 0alinear discriminant analysis1 aChree, A.1 aScaife, J.R.1 aMurray, I.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2005 June 1, v. 53, no. 11 p.4459-4463x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf050303i3Available from publisher's Web site  a20050902b00000000c00000000  aINDdRHFe2005/07/07  aOther US 7aarticle01954naa a2200277 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110100001800127245012000145300001600265520105700281650002301338650002201361700003101383700001801414700001601432773013801448852000901586930003301595945002501628946001101653655001201664IND4365748720221116183524.0041123e20041115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436574872DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

The enzyme exhibited a pI of 6.5, a carbohydrate content of 15%, and an apparent molecular mass of about 40 kDa. Optima of temperature and pH were 60 degrees C and 6.5, respectively. The enzyme was stable up to 1 h at 50 degrees C and exhibited a half-life of 20 min at 55 degrees C. The enzyme hydrolyzed p-nitrophenyl-beta-D-glucopyranoside, p-nitrophenyl-beta-D-xylopyranoside, o-nitrophenyl-beta-D-galactopyranoside, p-nitrophenyl-alpha-arabinopyranoside, cellobiose, laminaribiose and lactose. Kinetic studies indicated that the same enzyme hydrolyzed these substrates. beta-Glucosidase was activated by glucose or xylose at concentration varying from 50 to 200 mM. The apparent affinity constants (K(0.5)) for glucose and xylose were 36.69 and 43.24 mM, respectively. The stimulatory effect of glucose and xylose on the S. thermophilum beta-glucosidase is a novel characteristic which distinguish this enzyme from all other beta-glucosidases so far described. 3athermophilic fungi 3afungus physiology1 aPolizeli, M. de L.T. de M.1 aTerenzi, H.F.1 aJorge, J.A.0 tFEMS microbiology letters.g2004 Nov. 15, v. 240, no. 2 p.137-143aFederation of European Microbiological Societies.x0378-10977nnas  aDNAL  a20050810b00000000c00000000  aINDdGHKe2004/12/06  aNon-US 7aarticle01526naa a2200289 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127072001700144100001400161245011300175300001600288520063400304650001500938650003000953700001300983700001200996773013801008852000901146930003301155945002501188946001101213655001201224IND4365748620221116183536.0041123e20041115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436574862DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Three human colon cancer cell lines were treated with BB-pol; HT-29, HCT-116, and Caco-2. Trypan blue exclusion assay and BrdU incorporation assay showed that BB-pol inhibited the growth of HT-29 and HCT-116 cells but did not inhibit the growth of Caco-2 cells. 3aprobiotics 3aanticarcinogenic activity1 aOh, D.K.1 aJi, Ge.0 tFEMS microbiology letters.g2004 Nov. 15, v. 240, no. 2 p.131-136aFederation of European Microbiological Societies.x0378-10977nnas  aDNAL  a20050810b00000000c00000000  aINDdGHKe2004/12/06  aNon-US 7aarticle01883naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110100001500127245008700142300001600229520082200245650001801067650002001085650001801105650001001123650000901133650001001142650001501152650002801167650002301195700001601218700001401234700001701248700001601265773013801281852000901419930003301428945002501461946001101486655001201497IND4365749120221116183637.0041123e20041115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436574912DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Two different primers, M13 reverse and 10-mer primers, were used in the amplification and products resolved on non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel. With both DNA and RNA profiles Lupinus and Pisum rhizospheres were more similar to each other than to Vicia rhizosphere. The RAP-PCR products were also dot blotted and probed for bacterial peptidase transcripts. Plant-dependent rhizosphere effect was evident by the marked absence of transcripts for bacterial neutral metallopeptidase in Lupinus rhizosphere. The results of dot blot were further confirmed by RT-PCR for the expression of bacterial neutral metallopeptidase in the three rhizospheres. 3asoil bacteria 3arhizodeposition 3aLupinus albus 3aPisum 3apeas 3aVicia 3afaba beans 3asoil-plant interactions 3aDNA fingerprinting1 aAneja, M.K.1 aMayer, J.1 aSchloter, M.1 aMunch, J.C.0 tFEMS microbiology letters.g2004 Nov. 15, v. 240, no. 2 p.181-186aFederation of European Microbiological Societies.x0378-10977nnas  aDNAL  a20050810b00000000c00000000  aINDdGHKe2004/12/06  aNon-US 7aarticle01852naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110100001800127245014200145300001600287500001500303520089600318650002301214650001901237650001401256653002301270700001601293700001301309773013801322852000901460930003301469945002501502946001101527655001201538IND4365749020221116183648.0041123e20041115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436574902DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

It has 63% amino acid identity to the DegU response regulator of Bacillus subtilis. We have characterized the degU gene product in L. monocytogenes EGD by generation of a deletion mutant. The deltadegU mutant was found to be non-motile in motility plate assay and no flagellin was detected. The mutant was attenuated in challenge of mice. Northern blot analysis suggested that the degU gene product is a transcriptional activator of the flagellin gene, flaA, at 25 degrees C. However, the degU gene product had no influence on the transcription of prfA encoding the major virulence regulator, PrfA. The results indicate that the putative DegU response regulator is a pleiotropic regulator involved in expression of both motility at low temperature and in vivo virulence in mice. 3abacterial motility 3afood pathogens 3aflagellin 0abacterial proteins1 aOlsen, J.E.1 aDons, L.0 tFEMS microbiology letters.g2004 Nov. 15, v. 240, no. 2 p.171-179aFederation of European Microbiological Societies.x0378-10977nnas  aDNAL  a20050810b00000000c00000000  aINDdGHKe2004/12/06  aNon-US 7aarticle03448naa a2200697 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003600111040001800147072000900165072000900174072000900183100001900192245007500211300001600286500002400302500001500326520132600341650002801667650002101695650001701716650001401733650001701747650002401764650001801788650002801806650002401834650001601858650001001874650001101884650002701895650002401922650001101946650001801957650002401975650002801999650001402027650005302041650001202094650001102106650004302117650003102160650004902191650002102240650005002261650002402311650003502335653002502370653002402395700002002419700001702439773011802456852000902574856008602583930003302669945002502702946001102727655001202738IND4430016520221116183303.0091216e200911  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443001652DNAL7 a198150672pmid7 a10.1016/j.ibmb.2009.09.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF821 0aL200 0aL0011 aWhyard, Steven10aIngested double-stranded RNAs can act as species-specific insecticides  ap. 824-832.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aA serious shortcoming of many insecticides is that they can kill non-target species. To address this issue, we harnessed the sequence specificity of RNA interference (RNAi) to design orally-delivered double-stranded (ds) RNAs that selectively killed target species. Fruit flies (Drosophila melanogaster), flour beetles (Tribolium castaneum), pea aphids (Acyrthosiphon pisum), and tobacco hornworms (Manduca sexta) were selectively killed when fed species-specific dsRNA targeting vATPase transcripts. We also demonstrate that even closely related species can be selectively killed by feeding on dsRNAs that target the more variable regions of genes, such as the 3‚Ä≤ untranslated regions (UTRs): four species of the genus Drosophila were selectively killed by feeding on short (<40 nt) dsRNAs that targeted the 3‚Ä≤ UTR of the Œ≥-tubulin gene. For the aphid nymphs and beetle and moth larvae, dsRNA could simply be dissolved into their diets, but to induce RNAi in the drosophilid species, the dsRNAs needed to be encapsulated in liposomes to help facilitate uptake of the dsRNA. This is the first demonstration of RNAi following ingestion of dsRNA in all of the species tested, and the method offers promise of both higher throughput RNAi screens and the development of a new generation of species-specific insecticides. 3ainterspecific variation 3aRNA interference 3ainsect pests 3aingestion 3ainsecticides 3aTribolium castaneum 3aManduca sexta 3ainsecticidal properties 3aAcyrthosiphon pisum 3aplant pests 3agenes 3anymphs 3aliposomes (artificial) 3adouble-stranded RNA 3alarvae 3astorage pests 3aoral administration 3aDrosophila melanogaster 3amortality 2aAdenosine Triphosphatasesxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aAnimals 2aEating 2aInsect Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aInsecticidesxpharmacology 2aInsectaxdrug effectsxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aRNA Interference 2aRNA, Double-Strandedxgeneticsxpharmacology. 2aSpecies Specificity 2aTubulinxgeneticsxmetabolism. 0auntranslated regions 0aspecies differences1 aSingh, Aditi D.1 aWong, Sylvia0 tInsect biochemistry and molecular biology.g2009 Nov., v. 39, no. 11 p.824-832dElsevier Sciencex0965-17487nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ibmb.2009.09.0073Available from publisher's Web site  a20100220b20100305c00000000  aINDd2CTe2010/02/01  aNon-US 7aarticle04394naa a2200685 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153072000900171072000900180100002300189245015600212300001600368500002400384500001500408520218200423650002702605650001302632650001402645650002102659650001202680650002402692650001502716650001202731650003102743650002402774650001502798650001002813650002102823650006302844650004902907650004602956650001203002650001103014650002503025650003303050650000903083650005303092650001903145653001503164653004303179653002503222653002403247653002703271700002703298700002403325700001803349700002003367700001803387773012103405852000903526856009203535930003303627945002503660946001103685655001203696IND4382770020221116183319.0060813e200609  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438277002DNAL7 a169163532pmid7 a10.1111/j.1467-2995.2005.00260.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL800 0aL8101 aMalavasi, La√≠s M.10aEffects of extradural morphine on end-tidal isoflurane concentration and physiological variables in pigs undergoing abdominal surgery: a clinical study  ap. 307-312.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aTo evaluate the effects of preoperative extradural morphine on the end-tidal isoflurane (F [smallcapital e]'ISO) concentration and on physiological variables in pigs undergoing abdominal surgery. Prospective, randomized, blinded study. Fourteen healthy pigs (20 ¬± 4 kg) undergoing intestinal cannulation. Anaesthesia was induced with a combination of medetomidine (50 Œºg kg‚Åª¬π) and tiletamine-zolazepam (2.5 mg kg‚Åª¬π) injected intramuscularly, and was maintained with isoflurane in air and oxygen (F [smallcapital i]O‚ÇÇ = 50% O‚ÇÇ). In the first group, morphine (0.1 mg kg‚Åª¬π) was administered extradurally before surgery. The second group received an equivalent volume of extradural saline as control. During the experiment, heart and respiratory rates, mean arterial blood pressure, tidal volume and minute ventilation were recorded every 10 minutes. The concentration of F [smallcapital e]'ISO was adjusted, according to the depth of anaesthesia, by an experienced animal nurse. Within treatment groups, time-related changes in F [smallcapital e]'ISO and physiological variables were analysed using a repeated measurement [smallcapital anova]. Differences in data between treatment groups were analysed at specific time points using a Mann-Whitney U-test. Results are presented as mean ¬± SD; p < 0.05 was considered as significant. After the onset of action of the morphine, the F [smallcapital e]'ISO required to maintain anaesthesia was significantly lower in the extradural morphine group compared with control. During the expected maximal effect of the drug, F [smallcapital e]'ISO was significantly lower in the morphine group (0.6 ¬± 0.2%) than in the control group (0.9 ¬± 0.2%). The decrease in F [smallcapital e]'ISO indicated that the onset of action of morphine was approximately 30 minutes after injection. No significant differences in other clinical variables were found between the groups. Pigs that received extradural morphine before abdominal surgery achieved surgical anaesthetic depth at a lower F [smallcapital e]'ISO concentration. Extradural morphine allows abdominal surgery to be performed at a lower F [smallcapital e]'ISO concentrations. 3achemical concentration 3amorphine 3aanalgesia 3aveterinary drugs 3aabdomen 3aapplication methods 3aphysiology 3asurgery 3arandomized clinical trials 3adepth of anesthesia 3aisoflurane 3aswine 2aAbdomenxsurgery 2aAnalgesics, Opioidxadministration & dosagexpharmacology. 2aAnesthesia, Inhalationxmethodsxveterinary. 2aAnesthetics, Inhalationxpharmacokinetics 2aAnimals 2aFemale 2aInjections, Epidural 2aIsofluranexpharmacokinetics 2aMale 2aMorphinexadministration & dosagexpharmacology. 2aSwinexsurgery 0aanesthesia 0acardiovascular and respiratory effects 0aend-tidal isoflurane 0aextradural morphine 0aextradural application1 aJensen-Waern, Marianne1 aJacobson, Magdalena1 aRyden, Anneli1 a√ñhagen, Patrik1 aNyman, G√∂rel0 tVeterinary anaesthesia and analgesia.g2006 Sept., v. 33, no. 5 p.307-312dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx1467-29877nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-2995.2005.00260.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20080331b20080404c00000000  aINDd3CTe2008/02/26  aNon-US 7aarticle03634naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127072000900145072000900154072000900163072000900172100001500181245019400196300001600390500002400406500001500430520207000445650001502515650002602530650001602556650003502572650002002607650001302627650001702640650002102657650002502678650001302703650001102716653002102727653001602748653002202764653001802786700002102804700002102825773012302846852000902969856006902978930003303047945002503080946001103105655001203116IND4382830920221116183615.0060815e200606  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438283092DNAL7 a10.1007/s11240-006-9083-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF600 0aF500 0aF200 0aF1101 aThomas, P.10aCleansing the long-term micropropagated triploid watermelon cultures from covert bacteria and field testing the plants for clonal fidelity and fertility during the 7-10 year period in vitro  ap. 317-329.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe study was aimed primarily at cleansing the in vitro-decline displaying long-term micropropagated-triploid watermelon 'Arka Manik' cultures from covert bacteria and their further field testing. Disinfectant-treated shoots showed endophytic survival but to a lesser extent in shoot-tips. Culturing the NaOCl (5 min)-treated shoot-tips on filter paper bridges in liquid watermelon medium containing single antibiotic (gentamycin (Gm), amoxycillin (Ax) or cefazolin (Cz) at 50, 250, 500 or 1000 mg l-1) for 1 month followed by-repeated indexing of medium and tissue for two-four subculture passages facilitated the cleansing of cultures with 12.5% recovery as monitored for 2 years. Partial bleaching damage by NaOCl, phytotoxicity to higher levels of antibiotics, poor growth response in the initial sucrose-free medium and rampant hyperhydricity came in the way of a higher recovery. The effectiveness of the above approach was ascertained after back inoculating clean cultures with a mixture of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria yielding 30, 45 and 35% clean cultures in Gm, Ax and Cz (250 mg l-1 for 1 month) treatments, respectively in modified medium compared with 10% recovery after mere HgCl2 surface sterilization. The results indicated that antibiotic treatment was essential but not its choice, and extended culture indexing subsequent to disinfection or antibiotic treatment was crucial in identifying clean stocks. Cleansed cultures showed restoration of growth but a drop in rooting.Most of the in vitro cultures appeared normal and true-to-type during the 7-10 year period in vitro but a small proportion of bacteria harboring stocks displayed 'epigenetic variations'. Acclimatized plants and those in the field also appeared true-to-type but for a minor-proportion derived from bacteria-harboring stocks. Field-plants which originated from bacteria-freed stocks after 9 years of continuous culturing were normal and fertile validating the possibility of keeping-treasured cultures in vitro for long periods if covert contaminants are checked. 3aendophytes 3along term experiments 3aantibiotics 3aCitrullus lanatus var. lanatus 3aselective media 3aexplants 3adisinfection 3amicropropagation 3asomaclonal variation 3abacteria 3ashoots 0ain vitro culture 0amethodology 0agenetic variation 0aculture media1 aPrabhakara, B.S.1 aPitchaimuthu, M.0 tPlant cell, tissue, and organ culture.g2006 June, v. 85, no. 3 p.317-329dKluwer Academic Publishersx0167-68577nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11240-006-9083-53electronic resource  a20060823b20060906c00000000  aINDdMKSe2006/08/23  aNon-US 7aarticle02346naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003600092040001800128072000900146072000900155100001400164245006200178300001600240500002400256500001500280520109600295650002101391650001901412650002101431650002301452650002401475650001601499650002001515651001001535653001201545653001101557653004301568700001501611700001301626773011301639852000901752856007001761930003301831945002501864946001101889655001201900IND4382831220221116183806.0060815e200610  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438283122DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agsy.2006.01.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aB200 0aP2001 aBrown, C.10aDemand management of groundwater with monsoon forecasting  ap. 293-311.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThis paper presents an operational approach to setting prices for groundwater in accordance with the interannual variability of monsoon rainfall and the dynamic cost of groundwater use to society. The pricing system is designed for the state of Tamil Nadu, India, where groundwater is largely unregulated and the electricity for pumping is heavily subsidized. Depletion of aquifers during the primary growing season causes environmental damage and drying of wells. The proposed price-setting system estimates the marginal social cost of groundwater use based on the current state of aquifer storage and the forecast of the coming monsoon. Prices are set prior to onset of the monsoon so farmers can plan crop rotations according to the expectation of seasonal rainfall as reflected in the pricing signal. During years that forecasts accurately characterize the probability distribution of monsoon outcomes the market signal encourages economically efficient use of the resource. When monsoons differ from the expected outcome farmers are cushioned by ancillary effects of the pricing system. 3asystems analysis 3amonsoon season 3awater management 3aseasonal variation 3aweather forecasting 3agroundwater 3adecision making 3aIndia 0apricing 0ademand 0aseasonal climate forecast applications1 aRogers, P.1 aLall, U.0 tAgricultural systems.g2006 Oct., v. 90, no. 1-3 p.293-311dElsevier Applied Science [etc.]x0308-521X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agsy.2006.01.0033electronic resource  a20070312b20070402c00000000  aINDdRLGe2007/03/12  aNon-US 7aarticle02970naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131072000900149072000900158100001800167245010400185300001600289500002400305520172900329650002402058650001002082650001702092650002202109650001302131650001402144650001702158650001402175650001302189650002202202651001302224700001902237700001902256773011002275852000902385856007302394930003302467945002502500946001102525655001202536IND4382828320221116183820.0060815e200608  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438282832DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aquaeng.2006.01.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aW000 0aM1201 aStewart, N.T.10aCharacterization of nutrient leaching rates from settled rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) sludge  ap. 191-198.  aIncludes references  aThe leaching of nutrients from settled rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) sludge into overlying water was evaluated over a 7-day period. Nutrient leaching was assessed in a stagnant reaction tank and one agitated by aeration to simulate turbulent conditions in stocked production raceways. Leaching of total phosphorus (TP), ortho-phosphate (OP), total Kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN), total ammonia nitrogen (TAN), and total organic carbon (TOC) occurred rapidly during the first 24 h in both stagnant and agitated conditions. The highest 24 h leaching occurred in the agitated tank, and power regression equations accurately described the varying rates of increasing TP, OP, TAN and TKN. In the stagnant tank, linear increases of TP, OP, TKN and TAN concentrations occurred during the first 24 h. These linear increases continued from days 2 to 7, but at slower rates than occurred during the first 24 h. Average nutrient leaching rates (mg leached/g sludge-h); (dry weight basis) were calculated based on linear concentration increases. In the agitated tank, nutrient concentrations decreased after 60 h, as aerobic bacterial uptake and/or chemical precipitation was suspected. Therefore, average leaching rates could not be determined. These findings reveal that daily cleanout of settling areas could eliminate the release of TP, OP, TAN, TKN, and TOC from settled solids by 66%, 65%, 39%, 76%, and 51%, respectively, as compared to weekly cleanout schedules. Sustained leaching rates indicate nutrient release will likely continue beyond 7 days. This information suggests aggressive and continuous sludge management is most beneficial for maintaining high water quality and regulatory discharge compliance in fish production. 3aOncorhynchus mykiss 3atrout 3afish culture 3aaquaculture tanks 3araceways 3abiosolids 3asolid wastes 3anutrients 3aleaching 3apollution control 3aVirginia1 aBoardman, G.D.1 aHelfrich, L.A.0 tAquacultural engineering.g2006 Aug., v. 35, no. 2 p.191-198dApplied Science Publishersx0144-86097nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaeng.2006.01.0043electronic resource  a20060823b20060906c00000000  aINDdGAYe2006/08/23  aNon-US 7aarticle03036naa a2200697 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003200111040001800143072000900161072000900170072000900179072000900188100002100197245009300218300001600311500002400327500001500351520115400366650001901520650001401539650001701553650001001570650001801580650001201598650001301610650002801623650001201651650003001663650001201693650002501705650003801730650001101768650003401779650000901813650001701822650003701839650001401876650002301890651001101913653002301924653001001947653002301957653002101980653002802001700001502029700001702044700001302061700001302074700001602087700001402103773006502117852000902182856006602191930003302257945002502290946001102315655001202326IND4382826120221116183612.0060815e200605  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438282612DNAL7 a165524332pmid7 a10.1038/sj.hdy.68007842doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL700 0aL001 0aL600 0aL3001 aRashkovetsky, E.10aAdaptive differentiation of thermotolerance in Drosophila along a microclimatic gradient  ap. 353-359.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aWe examined whether a remarkable occurrence - the physiological evolution of two Drosophila melanogaster populations, despite a spatial separation of only 100-400 m, was idiosyncratic and temporary, or persisted over multiple years. We ascertained the high-temperature tolerance of Drosophila descended from populations on the north-facing slope (NFS) and south-facing slope (SFS) of 'Evolution Canyon' (Lower Nahal Oren, Mt Carmel, Israel), which were collected in 1997, 1999, and 2000. Results for these Drosophila uniformly resembled other studies in many respects: an inverse relationship between survival and heat-shock temperature, male-female differences in thermotolerance, and inducible thermotolerance. Importantly, for all years of collection, SFS flies consistently exceeded NFS flies in basal and inducible thermotolerance after diverse heat shocks, with and without thermal pretreatment, and whether isofemale lines, synthetic populations, or inbred lines were compared. Inbred lines, however, had lower thermotolerance than outbred lines. Several nonexclusive processes may explain the evolution of such physiological differentiation. 3aheat tolerance 3aevolution 3amicroclimate 3amales 3amicrohabitats 3acanyons 3aaltitude 3aDrosophila melanogaster 3afemales 2aAcclimatizationxgenetics 2aAnimals 2aBiological Evolution 2aDrosophila melanogasterxgenetics 2aFemale 2aHeat-Shock Responsexgenetics 2aMale 2aMicroclimate 2aMicrosatellite Repeatsxgenetics 2aPhenotype 2aSelection, Genetic 3aIsrael 0anorth-facing slope 0aslope 0asouth-facing slope 0aEvolution Canyon 0aphysiological evolution1 aIliadi, K.1 aMichalak, P.1 aLupu, A.1 aNevo, E.1 aFeder, M.E.1 aKorol, A.0 tHeredity.g2006 May, v. 96, no. 5 p.353-359x0018-067X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1038/sj.hdy.68007843electronic resource  a20060831b20060906c00000000  aINDdRHFe2006/08/31  aNon-US 7aarticle02268naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131072000900149100001200158245011500170300001600285500002400301500001500325520075000340650001601090650002101106650001201127650001301139650002101152650003601173650002101209650002201230650002301252650002001275653001701295653001801312700001401330700001201344700001201356700001201368700001201380700001501392700001301407773019101420852000901611856007301620930003301693945002501726946001101751655001201762IND4382828920221116183413.0060815e200610  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438282892DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodres.2006.05.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ1051 aSun, J.10aIdentification of (-)-epicatechin as the direct substrate for polyphenol oxidase isolated from litchi pericarp  ap. 864-870.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aPostharvest browning of litchi fruit results in a short life and a reduced commercial value.

New Zealand (NZ) and North American (NA) HF cows were randomly allocated to 1 of 3 levels of concentrate supplementation [0, 3, or 6 kg of dry matter (DM)/cow per d] on a basal pasture diet. The Wilmink exponential model was fitted within lactation (YDIM = a + b e(‚Åª‚Å∞.‚Å∞‚Åµ x DIM‚Åæ + c x DIM). The median variation explained by the function for milk yield was 86%, between 62 and 69% for milk composition, and 80 and 70% for BW and BCS, respectively. North American cows and cows supplemented with concentrates had greater peak and 270-d milk yield. Concentrate supplementation tended to accelerate the rate of incline to peak milk yield, but persistency of lactation was not affected by either strain of HF or concentrate supplementation. No significant strain by diet interaction was found for parameters reported. New Zealand cows reached nadir BCS 14 d earlier and lost less BW (22 kg) postcalving than NA cows. Concentrate supplementation reduced the postpartum interval to nadir BW and BCS, and incrementally increased nadir BCS. New Zealand cows gained significantly more BCS (i.e., 0.9 x 10‚Åª¬≥ units/d more) postnadir than NA cows, and the rate of BCS replenishment increased linearly with concentrate supplementation from 0.5 x 10‚Åª¬≥ at 0 kg of DM/d to 0.8 x 10‚Åª¬≥ and 1.6 x 10‚Åª¬≥ units/d at 3 and 6 kg of DM/d concentrates, respectively. Although there was no significant strain by diet interaction for parameters reported, there was a tendency for a strain by diet interaction in 270-d BCS, suggesting that the effect of concentrate supplementation on BCS gain was, at least partly, strain dependent. 3adairy cows 3aHolstein 3astrain differences 3agrazing 3afeed supplements 3afeed concentrates 3amilk yield 3alactation curve 3abody condition 3anutrition-genotype interaction 3aprovenance 3acow feeding 3abody weight 2aAnimals 2aBody Composition 2aBody Weight 2aBreeding 2aCattlexgeneticsxphysiology. 2aDairyingxmethods 2aDietxveterinary 2aDietary Supplements 2aFemale 2aGenotype 2aLactationxphysiology 2aLipidsxanalysis 2aMilkxchemistry 2aMilk Proteinsxanalysis 2aRandom Allocation 2aTime Factors 3aNew Zealand1 aBerry, D.P.1 aKolver, E.S.0 tJournal of dairy science.g2006 Sept., v. 89, no. 9 p.3532-3543dAmerican Dairy Science Associationx0022-03027nnas  aDNAL  a20070718b20070802c00000000  aINDdJITe2006/09/04  aOther US 7aarticle02859naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003200111040001800143072000900161072000900170100001400179245010900193300001600302500002400318500001500342520136900357650001901726650000901745650001901754650002701773650002501800650002801825650002301853650003701876650002401913650002001937650002501957650001301982650002001995650002102015650003102036653002202067653001902089653002302108773006602131852000902197856006602206930003302272945002502305946001102330655001202341IND4382825620221116182853.0060815e200604  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438282562DNAL7 a165086632pmid7 a10.1038/sj.hdy.68007972doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF200 0aX1001 aNixon, J.10aTesting for segregation distortion in genetic scoring data from backcross or doubled haploid populations  ap. 290-297.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aIt is important that breeders have the means to assess genetic scoring data for segregation distortion because of its probable effect on the design of efficient breeding strategies. Scoring data is usually assessed for segregation distortion by separate nonindependent chi 2 tests at each locus in a set of marker loci. This analysis gives the loci most affected by selection if it exists, but it cannot give a statistically correct test for the presence or absence of selection in a linkage group as a whole. I have used a combined test based on the statistic, which is the most significant P-value from the above tests, called the single locus test. I have also derived mathematically a new combined statistical test, the overall test, for segregation distortion that requires genetic scoring data for a single linkage group. This test also takes genetic linkage into account. Using a range of marker densities and population sizes, simulations were carried out, to compare the power of these two statistical tests to detect the effect of selection at one or two loci. The single locus test was always found to be more powerful than the overall test, but the single locus test required a more complicated P-value correction. For the single locus test, approximate correction factors for the P-values are given for a range of marker densities and genetic lengths. 3aplant genetics 3aloci 3alinkage groups 3asegregation distortion 3astatistical analysis 2aChi-Square Distribution 2aChromosome Mapping 2aChromosome Segregationxgenetics 2aComputer Simulation 2aGenetic Markers 2aGenetics, Population 2aHaploidy 2aModels, Genetic 2aPlantsxgenetics 2aReproducibility of Results 0asingle locus test 0aduplicate loci 0alinkage (genetics)0 tHeredity.g2006 Apr., v. 96, no. 4 p.290-297x0018-067X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1038/sj.hdy.68007973electronic resource  a20060831b20060906c00000000  aINDdRHFe2006/08/31  aNon-US 7aarticle03207naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003200111040001800143072000900161072000900170100001500179245009200194300001600286500002400302500001500326520149100341650002801832650002701860650002301887650001001910650002101920650002301941650003101964650002301995650002002018650002002038650002002058650001602078650001202094650003102106650004702137650002802184650001002212650005602222653002002278700001602298700001802314700001602332700001302348700001702361700001702378773006602395852000902461856006602470930003302536945002502569946001102594655001202605IND4382825320221116182814.0060815e200603  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438282532DNAL7 a163915492pmid7 a10.1038/sj.hdy.68007882doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL200 0aL8221 aDavies, G.10aQuantitative trait loci associated with parasitic infection in Scottish Blackface sheep  ap. 252-258.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThis study aimed to identify quantitative trait loci associated with endoparasitic infection in Scottish Blackface sheep. Data were collected from 789 animals over a 3-year period. All of the animals were continually exposed to a mixed nematode infection by grazing. Faecal samples were collected in August, September and October each year at ca. 16, 20 and 24 weeks of age; Nematodirus spp. eggs were counted separately from the other species of nematodes. Blood samples were collected in October from which immunoglobulin A (IgA) activity was measured and DNA was extracted for genotyping. In total, 139 Microsatellite markers were genotyped across eight chromosomal regions (chromosomes 1, 2, 3, 5, 14, 18, 20 and 21) in the sires and progeny were genotyped for the markers that were polymorphic in their sire. Evidence was found for quantitative trait loci (QTL) on chromosomes 2, 3, 14 and 20. QTL associated with specific IgA activity were identified in chromosomes 3 and 20, in regions close to IFNG (chromosome 3) and the MHC (chromosome 20). QTL associated with Nematodirus FEC were identified on chromosomes 2, 3 and 14. Lastly, QTL associated with non-Nematodirus Strongyle FEC were identified on chromosomes 3 and 20. This study has shown that some aspects of host resistance to gastrointestinal parasites are under strong genetic control, therefore these QTL could be utilised in a marker-assisted selection scheme to increase host resistance to gastrointestinal parasites. 3aquantitative trait loci 3amicrosatellite repeats 3aantibody formation 3asheep 3aimmunoglobulin A 3aScottish Blackface 3aanimal parasitic nematodes 3achromosome mapping 3afecal egg count 3apest resistance 3agenetic markers 3aNematodirus 2aAnimals 2aImmunoglobulin Axanalysis 2aNematode Infectionsxgeneticsxveterinary. 2aQuantitative Trait Loci 2aSheep 2aSheep Diseasesxgeneticsximmunologyxparasitology. 0aimmune response1 aStear, M.J.1 aBenothman, M.1 aAbuagob, O.1 aKerr, A.1 aMitchell, S.1 aBishop, S.C.0 tHeredity.g2006 Mar., v. 96, no. 3 p.252-258x0018-067X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1038/sj.hdy.68007883electronic resource  a20060831b20060906c00000000  aINDdRHFe2006/08/31  aNon-US 7aarticle03109naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003200111040001800143072000900161100002600170245008600196300001600282500002400298520163700322650001601959650001301975650002001988650002402008650001402032650002302046650003002069650001202099650001302111650002502124650002202149650002102171650001202192650002002204650003302224650003002257650001302287650001502300650004302315653002302358773006602381852000902447856006602456930003302522945002502555946001102580655001202591IND4382825520221116182746.0060815e200604  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438282552DNAL7 a164044122pmid7 a10.1038/sj.hdy.68007942doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF8221 aCastagnone-Sereno, P.10aGenetic variability and adaptive evolution in parthenogenetic root-knot nematodes  ap. 282-289.  aIncludes references  aRoot-knot nematodes (RKN) of the genus Meloidogyne are biotrophic plant parasites of major agricultural importance, which exhibit very variable modes of reproduction, from classical amphimixis to mitotic parthenogenesis. This review focuses on those RKN species that reproduce exclusively by mitotic parthenogenesis (apomixis), in contrast to those that have meiotic/amphimitic events in their life cycle. Although populations of clonal organisms are often represented as being ecologically isolated and evolutionary inert, a considerable volume of literature provides evidence that asexual RKN are neither: they are widely distributed, extremely polyphagous, and amenable to selection and adaptive variation. The ancestors of the genus are unknown, but it is assumed that the parthenogenetic RKN have evolved from amphimictic species through hybridization and subsequent aneuploidization and polyploidization events. Molecular studies have indeed confirmed that the phylogenetic divergence between meiotic and mitotic RKN lineages occurred early, and have revealed an unexpected level of clonal diversity among populations within apomictic species. Laboratory experiments have shown that asexual RKN can rapidly adapt to new environmental constraints (eg host resistance), although with some fitness costs. Lastly, the molecular and chromosomal mechanisms that could contribute to genome plasticity leading to persistent genetic variation and adaptive evolution in apomictic RKN are discussed. It is concluded that RKN provide an excellent model system in which to study the dynamic nature and adaptive potential of clonal genomes. 3aMeloidogyne 3aapomixis 3aparthenogenesis 3aroot-knot nematodes 3aevolution 3amolecular genetics 2aAdaptation, Physiological 2aAnimals 2aDiploidy 2aEvolution, Molecular 2aGenetic Variation 2aGenome, Helminth 2aMitosis 2aParthenogenesis 2aPlant Diseasesxparasitology 2aPlant Rootsxparasitology 2aPloidies 2aPolyploidy 2aTylenchoideaxgeneticsxpathogenicity. 0aliterature reviews0 tHeredity.g2006 Apr., v. 96, no. 4 p.282-289x0018-067X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1038/sj.hdy.68007943electronic resource  a20060831b20060906c00000000  aINDdRHFe2006/08/31  aNon-US 7aarticle02189naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003300111040001800144072000900162072000900171072000900180100002000189245010100209300001400310500002400324500001500348520076100363650002701124650001701151650001201168650000901180650002201189650002001211650001001231650002701241650001201268650001201280650001101292650002501303650000901328650002701337650002401364653001801388653002701406700001701433773006401450852000901514856006701523930003301590945002501623946001101648655001201659IND4382824320221116182921.0060815e200601  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438282432DNAL7 a161751922pmid7 a10.1038/sj.hdy.6800760;2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL821 0aL200 0aL0011 aMcMeniman, C.J.10aTransmission ratio distortion in the human body louse, Pediculus humanus (Insecta: Phthiraptera)  ap. 63-68.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aWe studied inheritance at three microsatellite loci in eight F1 and two F2 families of the body (clothes) louse of humans, Pediculus humanus.

In male body lice, where there was non-Mendelian inheritance, the paternally inherited set of alleles was eliminated.

We focus here on Quercus afares, an endemic North African species that combines morphological, physiological and ecological traits of both Q. suber and Q. canariensis, two phylogenetically distant species. These two species are sympatric with Q. afares over most of its distribution. We studied two Q. afares populations (one from Algeria and one from Tunisia), as well as several populations of both Q. suber and Q. canariensis sampled both within and outside areas where these species overlap with Q. afares. A genetic analysis was conducted using both nuclear (allozymes) and chloroplastic markers, which shows that Q. afares originates from a Q. suber x Q. canariensis hybridisation. At most loci, Q. afares predominantly possesses alleles from Q. suber, suggesting that the initial cross between Q. suber and Q. canariensis was followed by backcrossing with Q. suber. Other hypotheses that can account for this result, including genetic drift, gene silencing, gene conversion and selection, are discussed. A single Q. suber chlorotype was detected, and all Q. afares individuals displayed this chlorotype, indicating that Q. suber was the maternal parent. Q. afares is genetically, morphologically and ecologically differentiated from its parental species, and can therefore be considered as a stabilised hybrid species. 3aloci 3aalleles 3ainterspecific hybridization 3achloroplast DNA 3anuclear genome 3aQuercus suber 3aallozymes 3agenetic markers 2aCell Nucleusxgenetics 2aChloroplastsxgenetics 2aCytoplasmxgenetics 2aEnzymesxgenetics 2aGenetic Markers 2aGenetics, Population 2aHybridization, Genetic 2aModels, Genetic 2aPolymorphism, Genetic 2aPolymorphism, Restriction Fragment Length 2aQuercusxgenetics 3aAlgeria 3aTunisia 0aAfrica, Northern 0aQuercus 0aspeciation 0aQuercus afares 0aQuercus canariensis1 aToumi, L.1 aJarne, P.1 aSarda, V.1 aDi Giusto,  F.1 aLumaret, R.0 tHeredity.g2006 Feb., v. 96, no. 2 p.175-184x0018-067X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1038/sj.hdy.68007823electronic resource  a20060831b20060906c00000000  aINDdRHFe2006/08/31  aNon-US 7aarticle04046naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024002800133040001800161100001800179245012700197300001600324500002400340500001500364506007600379520221200455506003702667650002402704650001502728650001802743650001102761650001302772650001102785650001302796650009102809650007202900650003502972653002003007653001903027653001603046653001203062653001503074653002703089700002003116700001403136700001703150773010003167852000903267856007803276856006903354930003303423945002503456946001103481655001203492IND4382800520221207070356.0060813e200609  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438280052DNAL7 a168072562pmid7 aPMC28035712pmcid7 a10.1093/aob/mcl1382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVRIJDAGHS, A.14aThe Floral Scales in Hellmuthia (Cyperaceae, Cyperoideae) and Paramapania (Cyperaceae, Mapanioideae): An Ontogenetic Study  ap. 619-630.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: and Aims In 1976 the monotypic genus Hellmuthia was placed in the Hypolytreae s.l., but was subsequently ascribed to the Mapanioideae, tribe Chrysitricheae, mainly because of the presence in Hellmuthia of two lateral, mapanioid-like floral scales with ciliated keels, the anatomy of the nutlet, the embryo and the inflorescence. Recently, based on cladistic analyses and supported by pollen ontogenetic evidence, Hellmuthia was transferred to a Cyperaceae, tribe Cypereae, clade mainly consisting of Ficinia and ISOLEPIS: In this study, the floral ontogeny in Hellmuthia was investigated and compared with the floral ontogeny in Paramapania, with special attention for the floral scales. METHODS: Freshly collected inflorescences of Hellmuthia membranacea and Paramapania parvibractea were investigated using scanning electron and light microscopy. Key Results In the conical 'spikelet' in Hellmuthia, proximal bracts occur, each axillating an axis with empty glume-like structures, or a reduced spikelet. Hence, it is a reduced partial inflorescence. In Hellmuthia, the stamen primordia originate before the primordia of the perianth-gynoecium appear. Moreover, a third adaxially positioned 'floral scale' was observed for the first time. The position and relative time of appearance of the floral scales in Hellmuthia are typical for perianth parts in Cyperoideae. The basal position of Hellmuthia within a clade of species with usually perianthless flowers, allows the presence of rudiments of a perianth in Hellmuthia to be interpreted as a primitive state. Development of the lateral 'scales' in Paramapania follows a different pattern. Therefore, it was decided that the lateral 'scales' in Paramapania are different from the lateral perianth parts in HELLMUTHIA: The pollen grains in Hellmuthia are cyperoid, with one polar and five lateral apertures, of which the membrane is covered with sexinous bodies. The pollen surface is granulate and perforate with microspines. CONCLUSIONS: The floral ontogeny in Hellmuthia occurs according to the general cyperoid pattern. The lateral scales in Hellmuthia are perianth parts, and they are not homologous to the lateral 'scales' in PARAMAPANIA:0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3ataxonomic revisions 3aCyperaceae 3amorphogenesis 3abracts 3aontogeny 3apollen 3aperianth 2aCyperaceaexanatomy & histologyxclassificationxgrowth & developmentxultrastructure. 2aFlowersxanatomy & histologyxgrowth & developmentxultrastructure. 2aMicroscopy, Electron, Scanning 0afloral ontogeny 0ainflorescences 0aParamapania 0astamens 0aHellmuthia 0aanatomy and morphology1 aGOETGHEBEUR, P.1 aSMETS, E.1 aMUASYA, A.M.0 tAnnals of botany.g2006 Sept., v. 98, no. 3 p.619-630dOxford University Pressx0305-73647nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/aob/mcl1383Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://aob.oupjournals.org/3Available from publisher's Web site  a20110328b20110402c00000000  aINDdTEMeLYN 2011/0  aNon-US 7aarticle02949naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003200111040001800143072000900161100001100170245010800181300001400289500002400303500001500327520129500342650003001637650001901667650001201686650000901698650002401707650001601731650002001747650001901767650001301786650001201799650002501811650001901836650001201855650002001867650001501887650002001902650002901922650002601951650002401977650002302001650002502024653002402049653001402073653001202087653002402099653001602123773006402139852000902203856006602212930003302278945002502311946001102336655001202347IND4382823920221116183104.0060815e200601  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438282392DNAL7 a161895462pmid7 a10.1038/sj.hdy.68007402doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF2001 aLu, Y.10aHistorical events and allelic polymorphism at the gametophytic self-incompatibility locus in Solanaceae  ap. 22-28.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe historical migration rate of a species is often difficult to estimate with neutral markers, because the relationship between the turnover time of the markers and the age of the species commonly remains unknown. Compared with neutral markers, the plant self-incompatibility locus (S) provides a much better source of data for migration-rate estimation due to its high allelic polymorphism and antiquity. Here, the results from extensive surveys of S alleles in two wild solanaceous species, Solanum carolinense and Physalis longifolia, indicate that historical migration rates have differed significantly between the species; the higher migration rate found in S. carolinense appears to have interacted with the balancing selection at the S locus to result in fewer S alleles being maintained in the species. Historical population growth rates estimated via a modified coalescent approach also suggest a faster growing population for S. carolinense than for P. longifolia, which would have further widened their interspecific difference in S-allelle polymorphism. These historical factors may have reduced the probability of new S alleles to prevailing in S. carolinense, leaving old ones segregating at the S locus with little signature of positive selection being currently detectable. 3ageographical distribution 3aplant genetics 3aalleles 3aloci 3aSolanum carolinense 3apollen flow 3aplant fertility 3aphytogeography 3aPhysalis 3aselfing 3agenetic polymorphism 3aseed dispersal 2aAlleles 2aGenetic Markers 2aGerm Cells 2aModels, Genetic 2aPlant Proteinsxgenetics 2aPolymorphism, Genetic 2aPopulation Dynamics 2aSelection, Genetic 2aSolanaceaexgenetics 0aPhysalis longifolia 0aS alleles 0aS locus 0apopulation genetics 0apollination0 tHeredity.g2006 Jan., v. 96, no. 1 p.22-28x0018-067X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1038/sj.hdy.68007403electronic resource  a20060831b20060906c00000000  aINDdRHFe2006/08/31  aNon-US 7aarticle02203naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003100092040001800123100002100141245013100162300001800293500002400311520093900335650001301274650001601287650001401303650001601317650001801333650002101351650001001372650001601382650002201398650001501420650001901435650002001454650001101474651001001485700002401495700001201519700001601531700001601547773011601563852000901679856008101688655001201769IND4368024920221116183628.0050329s2004    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436802492DNAL7 a10.1081/CSS-1200385642doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSrinivasarao, C.10aSulphur availability and response of mungbean and urdbean to sulphur on different soil types of pulse growing regions of India  ap. 1713-1723.  aIncludes references  aAvailable sulphur (S) extracted in five extractants, crop response to S application and use efficiency of S by mungbean (Vigna radiata L.) and urdbean (Vigna mungo L.) were studied on different soil types of pulse growing regions of India. Among extractants tested, 1 N NH4OAc extracted higher S followed by Morgan's reagent, 0.001 N HCl, 0.15% CaCl2, and 1% NaCl. Response of urdbean was in higher magnitude as compared to mungbean to 20 mg S kg(-1). In both the crops, larger response was obtained in Inceptisols followed by Vertisols and lower response was found in Alfisols. Larger utilization of native soil S in case of Alfisols by both the crops resulted in lower levels of response to added fertilizer S. Owing to high degree of correlation with plant response, 0.15% CaCl2 and Morgan's reagent can be used as soil test methods for assessing the available S supply and predicting the crop response to applied S on these soils. 3aAlfisols 3aInceptisols 3aVertisols 3aVigna mungo 3aVigna radiata 3acalcium chloride 3acrops 3afertilizers 3ahydrochloric acid 3amung beans 3aplant response 3asodium chloride 3asulfur 3aIndia1 aGaneshamurthy, A.N.1 aAli, M.1 aSingh, R.N.1 aSingh, K.K.0 tCommunications in soil science and plant analysis.g2004, v. 35, no. 11-12 p.1713-1723dDekkerx0010-36247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1081/CSS-1200385643Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03505naa a2200697 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002000164245010700184300001600291500001500307520148000322650001401802650001701816650002201833650001801855650001501873650001101888650001901899650000901918650001201927650000901939650001501948650001401963650002901977650001102006650001302017650001302030650001802043650001402061650002202075650002302097650002102120650002902141650003302170650002102203650002902224650004102253650001902294651001002313651001002323653002802333653001102361653002002372653002902392700001902421700001602440700002102456700002502477700002102502773013402523852000902657856008502666930003302751946001102784655001202795IND4439739320221116183404.0100709e201008  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443973932DNAL7 a195936442pmid7 a10.1007/s10661-009-1065-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAhmed, Faruque 10aAbundances, distribution, and sources of trace metals in Nakaumi-Honjo coastal lagoon sediments, Japan  ap. 473-491.  a2019-12-04  aBottom sediments from Nakaumi Lagoon and the Honjo Area in southwest Japan were analyzed to determine their geochemical compositions and to assess potential impacts by comparison with sediment quality guidelines. Present-day water quality was also assessed. Results showed that the water quality of Nakaumi Lagoon and the Honjo area contrasts between their upper and lower parts. Average abundances of As, Pb, Zn, Cu, Ni, and Cr in the Nakaumi sediments were 12, 25, 135, 32, 21, and 46 ppm, respectively, compared to 10, 24, 110, 26, 20, and 38 ppm in the Honjo area. All averages are greater than those of the upper continental crust. The elevated metal concentrations are probably related to the fine-grained nature of the sediments, reducing bottom conditions produced by abundant organic matter and possibly minor non-point anthropogenic sources. Trace metal contents are strongly correlated with Fe‚ÇÇO‚ÇÉ, suggesting that Fe oxides play a role in controlling abundances. Metal concentrations exceed the NYSDEC lowest effect level and CCME interim sediment quality guidelines that indicate moderate impact on aquatic organisms. Average abundances of As and Zn are comparable to the Coastal Ocean Sediment Database threshold, whereas maximum concentrations exceed that value, indicating that the concentrations of these metals are potentially toxic. These enrichments suggest that regular monitoring may be desirable even where no point sources of metal pollution exist. 3asediments 3aferric oxide 3aaquatic organisms 3awater quality 3amonitoring 3acopper 3aorganic matter 3alead 3aarsenic 3azinc 3aguidelines 3apollution 3aanthropogenic activities 3anickel 3atoxicity 3achromium 3acoastal water 3adatabases 2aArsenicxanalysis 2aChromiumxanalysis 2aCopperxanalysis 2aEnvironmental Monitoring 2aGeologic Sedimentsxanalysis 2aNickelxanalysis 2aTrace Elementsxanalysis 2aWater Pollutants, Chemicalxanalysis 2aZincxanalysis 3aJapan 0aJapan 0aCoastal lagoon sediment 0aoxides 0aSouthwest Japan 0aEnvironmental guidelines1 aBibi, M.

This hypothesis, however, is not supported empirically for shade-tolerant trees, the dominant plant group in tropical forests. The failure of gaps to maintain shade-tolerant trees remains puzzling, and the hypothesis implicated to date is dispersal limitation. In central Panama, we tested an alternative 'biotic interference' hypothesis: that competition between growth forms (lianas vs. trees) constrains shade-tolerant tree recruitment, survival and diversity in gaps. We experimentally removed lianas from eight gaps and monitored them for 8 years, while also monitoring nine un-manipulated control gaps. Removing lianas increased tree growth, recruitment and richness by 55, 46 and 65%, respectively. Lianas were particularly harmful to shade-tolerant species, but not pioneers. Our findings demonstrate that competition between plant growth forms constrains diversity in a species-rich tropical forest. Because lianas are abundant in many tropical systems, our findings may apply broadly. 3ahabitats 3alianas 3amonitoring 3ashade tolerance 3aspecies recruitment 3atree growth 3atrees 3atropical forests 2aAdaptation, Physiological 2aBiodiversity 2aTreesxphysiology 3aPanama 0aPanama 0aBarro Colorado Nature Monument 0adiversity maintenance 0agap-phase regeneration 0atreefall gaps1 aCarson, Walter P.0 tEcology letters.g2010 July, v. 13, no. 7 p.849-857dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx1461-023X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1461-0248.2010.01480.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20100619b20100703c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03329naa a2200625 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100002100171245012700192300001600319520125500335650002501590650002901615650002901644650001601673650001301689650001801702650001201720650001101732650003301743650001201776650001301788650002401801650001801825650002001843650002201863650001301885650001301898650001101911650002601922650002301948650002301971650004301994650003202037650004502069650001802114650002502132650002402157650008802181650008102269653002902350653001002379653002102389700002002410773011602430852000902546856009202555930003302647946001102680655001202691IND4439657820221116183642.0100709e201008  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443965782DNAL7 a204919412pmid7 a10.1111/j.1567-1364.2010.00636.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShepherd, Andrew14aThe Fps1p aquaglyceroporin facilitates the use of small aliphatic amides as a nitrogen source by amidase-expressing yeasts  ap. 527-534.  aSaccharomyces cerevisiae acquires a resistance to high, toxic levels of acetic acid by destabilizing Fps1p, the plasma membrane aquaglyceroporin through which this acid - in its undissociated state - enters the cell. In this study, Fps1p loss was shown to confer resistances to acetic acid, acrolein and allyl alcohol, not just in S. cerevisiae but also in the osmotolerant spoilage yeast Zygosaccharomyces rouxii. However, in Z. rouxii, the loss of Fps1p severely compromised the use of acetamide and several other small amides as sources of nitrogen, an indication that these amides enter the cells of this yeast by passive diffusion through the Fps1p pore. Saccharomyces cerevisiae cannot grow on acetamide, but was conferred with an ability to use this and other small amides as nitrogen sources by heterologous expression of a Z. rouxii ORF (ZrAMD1) with protein sequence identity to the amdS-encoded amidase of Aspergillus nidulans. This capacity of ZrAMD1-expressing S. cerevisiae to assimilate amide nitrogen was severely compromised by the loss of Fps1p. ZrAMD1 appears to encode the major amidase of Z. rouxii as a Zramd1Œî deletant mutant had, like the Zrfps1Œî deletant, lost the ability to assimilate small amides as sources of nitrogen. 3aAspergillus nidulans 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3aZygosaccharomyces rouxii 3aacetic acid 3aacrolein 3aallyl alcohol 3aamidase 3aamides 3aheterologous gene expression 3amutants 3anitrogen 3aopen reading frames 3aosmotolerance 3aplasma membrane 3asequence analysis 3aspoilage 3atoxicity 3ayeasts 2aAcetic Acidxtoxicity 2aAcroleinxtoxicity 2aAmidesxmetabolism 2aAmidohydrolasesxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aAntifungal Agentsxtoxicity 2aAquaglyceroporinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aGene Deletion 2aNitrogenxmetabolism 2aPropanolsxtoxicity 2aSaccharomyces cerevisiaexdrug effectsxgeneticsxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aZygosaccharomycesxdrug effectsxgeneticsxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 0aZygosaccharomyces rouxii 0aFps1p 0aaquaglyceroporin1 aPiper, Peter W.0 tFEMS yeast research.g2010 Aug., v. 10, no. 5 p.527-534dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx1567-13567nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1567-1364.2010.00636.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20100709b20100807c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02114naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100003000152245010000182300001600282520075500298650003001053650002801083650001801111650001101129650002501140650001101165650001401176650001801190650002201208651001601230653003301246653001301279653001301292653001401305700002101319700001901340700001901359700001701378773012801395852000901523856009201532930003301624946001101657655001201668IND4432303420221116183209.0100205e201003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443230342DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1439-0434.2009.01602.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKamala-Kannan, Seralathan10aFirst Report of Aster Yellows Phytoplasma in Goldenrain Tree (Koelreuteria paniculata) in Korea  ap. 197-199.  aAster yellows phytoplasma was detected for the first time in goldenrain tree (Koelreuteria paniculata) growing in Sinpyeong-myeon, Jeollabuk-do, South Korea. DNA was extracted from the infected leaf samples and part of the 16S rDNA, rp operon and tuf gene were amplified using R16F2n/R2 and gene-specific primers. The sequence analysis showed that the phytoplasma was closely related (99%) to members of the Aster Yellows (AY) group, and belonging to 16Sr I, subgroup B. Moreover, the 16S rDNA sequences of the isolate showed 88-96% identity with members of other 16Sr and undesignated groups. Based on the sequence identity and phylogenetic studies, it was confirmed that phytoplasma infecting goldenrain tree in South Korea belongs to the AY group. 3aAster yellows phytoplasma 3aKoelreuteria paniculata 3aaster yellows 3aleaves 3anucleotide sequences 3aoperon 3aphylogeny 3aribosomal DNA 3asequence analysis 3aSouth Korea 0agoldenrain stunt phytoplasma 0a16S rDNA 0atuf gene 0arp operon1 aPark, Seung-Moon1 aOH, Byung-Taek1 aKim, Hyung-Moo1 aLee, Kui-Jae0 tPhytopathologische Zeitschrift.g2010 Mar., v. 158, no. 3 p.197-199dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0931-17857nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1439-0434.2009.01602.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20100205b20100305c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02043naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002000145245014000165300001600305500002400321520108800345650001401433650001201447650001001459650001401469650001601483650001501499650001201514650001401526651001201540773010801552852000901660856004801669655001201717IND4427132720221116175808.0091012e200909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442713272DNAL7 a10.1134/S00138738090601042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKovblyuk, N.

D. karadagensis sp. n. is characterized by the septum stalk merging with the bottom of epigyne groove not reaching its mid-length, and also by the unique epigyne length (more than 2.5 times as long as the septum width) and by the unique length of tegular apophysis of the bulbus (exceeding the width of the bulbus itself). Males and females of D. karadagensis sp. n. can be found in Submediterranean steppes and steppified areas in open woodlands of pistachio, downy oak, and Greek juniper in October and November. One female was found in July. D. karadagensis sp. n. was probably described earlier as Alopecosa chiragrica (Thorell, 1875) nomen dubium (sub Tarentula). However, the use of the name A. chiragrica is inappropriate because of inadequate original description and unreliability of spider species identification based on immature specimens. 3aLycosidae 3afemales 3amales 3anew genus 3anew species 3apistachios 3asteppes 3awoodlands 3aUkraine0 tEntomological revue.g2009 Sept., v. 89, no. 6 p.745-752dSP MAIK Nauka/Interperiodicax0013-87387nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1134/S0013873809060104 7aarticle02598naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003000092024002200122024001900144040001800163100002000181245008000201300001800281500002400299506007600323520122500399506003701624650002801661650002601689650001601715650001401731650001201745650001101757650003001768650002301798650001601821700002201837700001801859700002201877700002201899700001901921773013501940852000902075856008002084655001202164IND4402288220221207051817.0080302e20080301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440228822DNAL7 a10.1128/AEM.02424-072doi7 aPMC22586512pmcid7 a181653712pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLeibig, Martina10aMarker Removal in Staphylococci via Cre Recombinase and Different lox Sites  ap. 1316-1323.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aAllelic replacement in staphylococci is frequently aided by antibiotic resistance markers that replace the gene(s) of interest. In multiply modified strains, the number of mutated genes usually correlates with the number of selection markers in the strain's chromosome. Site-specific recombination systems are capable of eliminating such markers, if they are flanked by recombinase recognition sites. In this study, a Cre-lox setting was established that allowed the efficient removal of resistance genes from the genomes of Staphylococcus carnosus and S. aureus. Two cassettes conferring resistance to erythromycin or kanamycin were flanked with wild-type or mutant lox sites, respectively, and used to delete single genes and an entire operon. After transformation of the cells with a newly constructed cre expression plasmid (pRAB1), genomic eviction of the resistance genes was observed in approximately one out of ten candidates analyzed and subsequently verified by PCR. Due to its thermosensitive origin of replication, the plasmid was then easily eliminated at nonpermissive temperatures. We anticipate that the system presented here will prove useful for generating markerless deletion mutants in staphylococci.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aStaphylococcus carnosus 3aantibiotic resistance 3achromosomes 3akanamycin 3amutants 3aoperon 3apolymerase chain reaction 3areplication origin 3atemperature1 aKrismer, Bernhard1 aKolb, Martina1 aFriede, Alexandra1 aG√∂tz, Friedrich.1 aBertram, Ralph0 tApplied and environmental microbiology.g2008 Mar. 1, v. 74, no. 5 p.1316-1323dAmerican Society for Microbiologyx0099-22407nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1128/AEM.02424-073Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03595naa a2200637 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002700164245018900191300001600380500002400396520161800420650002402038650001302062650002002075650002702095650002702122650001102149650002402160650001302184650002002197650001302217650000902230650001902239650001202258650000902270650001502279650001702294650000802311650001002319650001202329650003502341650003602376650002402412650004402436650003302480650002902513650003902542650003202581651000902613700001902622700002202641700002802663700002402691700002402715700001902739700001802758773011202776852000902888856004802897655001202945IND4415664420221116175831.0090130e200903  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441566442DNAL7 a190093612pmid7 a10.1007/s10493-008-9214-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPraphathip Eamsobhana.10aLaboratory evaluation of aromatic essential oils from thirteen plant species as candidate repellents against Leptotrombidium chiggers (Acari: Trombiculidae), the vector of scrub typhus  ap. 257-262.  aIncludes references  aScrub typhus, a rickettsial disease transmitted by several species of Leptotrombidium chiggers (larvae), is endemic in many areas of Asia. The disease is best prevented by the use of personal protective measures, including repellents. In this study commercially produced aromatic, essential oils of 13 plant species and ethanol (control) were tested in the laboratory for repellency against host-seeking chiggers of Leptotrombidium imphalum Vercammen-Grandjean and Langston (Acari: Trombiculidae). A rapid, simple and economic in vitro test method was used by exposing the chigger for up to 5 min. Repellency was based on relative percentages of chiggers attracted to test and control substances. Four of the 13 essential oils showed promise as effective repellent against L. imphalum chiggers. Syzygium aromaticum (clove) oil exhibited 100% repellency at 5% concentration (dilution with absolute ethanol), whereas Melaleuca alternifolia (tea tree) oil exhibited 100% repellency at 40% concentration. Undiluted oils of Zingiber cassamunar (plai) and Eucalyptus globules (blue gum) exhibited 100% repellency. Of the remaining nine essential oils, only 100% Pelargonium graveolens (geranium) exhibited >50% repellency (viz. 57%). Styrax torkinensis (benzoin) oil did not exhibit any repellency. These findings show that several aromatic, essential oils of plants may be useful as chigger repellent for the prevention of scrub typhus. Syzygium aromaticum oil may be safer and more economical to prevent chigger attacks than commercially available synthetic chemicals, such as DEET that may have harmful side effects. 3aEucalyptus globulus 3aGeranium 3aLeptotrombidium 3aMelaleuca alternifolia 3aPelargonium graveolens 3aStyrax 3aSyzygium aromaticum 3aZingiber 3aadverse effects 3achiggers 3adeet 3aessential oils 3aethanol 3aoils 3arepellents 3ascrub typhus 3atea 3atrees 2aAnimals 2aArachnid Vectorsxdrug effects 2aInsect Repellentsxpharmacology 2aLarvaxdrug effects 2aMite Infestationsxprevention & control 2aOils, Volatilexpharmacology 2aPlant Oilsxpharmacology 2aScrub Typhusxprevention & control 2aTrombiculidaexdrug effects 3aAsia1 aYoolek, Adisak1 aKongkaew, Wittaya1 aLerdthusnee, Kriangkrai1 aKhlaimanee, Nittaya1 aParsartvit, Anchana1 aMalainual, Nat1 aYong, Hoi-Sen0 tExperimental & applied acarology.g2009 Mar., v. 47, no. 3 p.257-262dSpringer Netherlandsx0168-81627nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10493-008-9214-2 7aarticle02313naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002500092040001800117100001900135245008500154300001600239520116600255650001901421650002301440650002201463650002101485650002601506650001101532650001101543650002301554651001101577653002201588700001701610700002401627700002601651773012201677852000901799856007501808930003301883946001101916655001201927IND4436212920221116175803.0100430s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443621292DNAL7 a10.1071/AP090882doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 ada Rocha, J.G.10aTemporal and spatial dynamics of coffee leaf scorch caused by Xylella fastidiosa  ap. 234-240.  aField experiments were conducted at a commercial coffee (Coffea arabica) field in the counties of S√£o Gotardo and Erv√°lia in the state of Minas Gerais, Brazil, to study the spatial and temporal dynamics of coffee leaf scorch (CLS) by assessing the incidence and severity of the disease. The spatial distribution of CLS were analysed using ordinary runs on rows and across rows, analyses of the dynamics and structure of foci, as well as analysis using modified Taylor's law. The temporal distribution of CLS was analysed using the real and cumulative incidence of the disease, and the data were used to calculate the rate of the disease progress. Diseased plants were aggregated according to modified Taylor's law and by the analysis of ordinary runs and structure of foci. Dissemination of the disease occurred mainly in plant rows. Diseased plants occurred at the beginning in isolated foci, and with an increase in disease incidence they later became more aggregated. The maximum values for CLS incidence occurred in December, when the rate of disease progress was 0.18 plants/month, whereas in the winter months the CLS rate of progress was close to zero. 3aCoffea arabica 3aXylella fastidiosa 3adisease incidence 3adisease severity 3afield experimentation 3aleaves 3ascorch 3atemporal variation 3aBrazil 0atemporal analysis1 aZambolim, L.1 aMaciel-Zambolim, E.1 ado Vale, F.X.

The outbreak of Rabbit Calicivirus Disease (RCD or RHD) in late 1995 at Kinchega National Park (NP) in arid western NSW, Australia, coincided with intensified warren ripping and other rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus) control efforts. We monitored changes in rabbit numbers in response to these factors using spotlight counts and dung-pellet counts. Rabbit populations declined initially, and were low for the remainder of the study. To assess the impact of rabbit control on vegetation, we examined whether recruitment of seedlings or vegetative suckers was occurring at Kinchega NP, following the arrival of RCD; how long such recruits were likely to survive under current grazing pressures; and whether the magnitude of current seedling and vegetative sucker recruitment and survival is greater than available data prior to RCD and extensive warren control. We followed the survival of individual seedlings and newly emerged suckers of six shrub or tree species, most of which are considered to be at risk of local decline. Three levels of caging were used to exclude all mammalian grazers; all mammalian grazers except rabbits; and no mammalian grazers. Pooled cohorts of seedlings and suckers were analysed using failure-time analyses. During the course of the study, suckering was observed in four species (Acacia carneorum, Alectryon oleifolius, Casuarina pauper and Santalum acuminatum), with seedlings observed in the other two species (Dodonaea viscosa and Acacia ligulata). Survival of suckers of some species was slightly greater than pre-RCD estimates, but in general, a pattern of little or nil recruitment is likely in suckers exposed to rabbits or to all grazing mammals. Seedling survival was particularly low regardless of the level of exclusion, largely due to desiccation. Reduction of grazing impacts may only allow recruitment into populations of species reliant on seedlings under more favourable climatic circumstances than experienced in this study, while the probability of successful recruitment into populations of suckering species in western NSW continues to be low even at very low rabbit densities. 3arabbits 3arisk 3aarid zones 3anational parks 3ashrubs 3aAcacia 3aferal animals 3aseedlings 3aDodonaea viscosa 3agrazing 3asuckering 3aCasuarina 3atrees 3aSantalum acuminatum 3aOryctolagus cuniculus 3ahabitats 3aRabbit hemorrhagic disease virus 0arecruitment1 aAuld, T.D.0 tAustral ecology.g2004 Oct., v. 29, no. 5 p.585-599dBlackwell Sciencex1442-99857nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1442-9993.2004.01393.x3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02127naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130100001800148245011000166300001300276500002400289520093400313650002001247650001601267650002101283650001801304650001201322650001001334650002801344650001001372650001601382650000901398650001201407650001201419650002001431650001901451700001501470700001801485700001801503773008701521852000901608856008801617655001201705IND4370245020221116175659.0050516s2004    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437024502DNAL7 a10.1080/000716604100016688062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHocking, P.M.10aDifferent concentrations and sources of dietary fibre may improve the welfare of female broilers breeders  ap. 9-19.  aIncludes references  a1. Broiler breeder females were fed restricted allocations of food to meet target body weights. They were fed on a standard wheat-soy ration or on one of three series of rations containing 50, 100 or 200 g/kg of ground oat hulls, ground unmolassed sugar beet pulp or sunflower meal. Changes in behaviour and heterophil-lymphocyte ratio (HLR) were measured at 5, 10 and 15 weeks of age. 2. Body weight at 15 weeks of age decreased in a linear manner with increasing concentrations of the experimental ingredients. 3. Decreased spot pecking was observed in birds fed on the rations containing 50 g/kg of sugar beet pulp and 200 g/kg of oat hulls. 4. The HLR was higher in birds fed on the control diet and diets containing 50 g/kg of the high fibre ingredients. 5. Rations containing sugar beet pulp were associated with higher water contents in the gastrointestinal tract and it is proposed that this improved satiety and welfare. 3abehavior change 3abody weight 3abroiler breeders 3adietary fiber 3afemales 3afoods 3agastrointestinal system 3ahulls 3aingredients 3aoats 3apecking 3asatiety 3asugar beet pulp 3asunflower meal1 aZaczek, V.1 aJones, E.K.M.1 aMacleod, M.G.0 tBritish poultry science.g2004 Feb., v. 45, no. 1 p.9-19dLongmanx0007-16687nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/000716604100016688063Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03143naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003800111040001800149100002100167245008500188300001400273500002400287520157400311650002101885650001801906650000901924650001201933650001801945650001701963650001001980650001601990650001802006650001302024650001802037650001802055650002102073650002602094650002802120650001602148650004702164650001202211650003002223650002502253650002602278650001802304650000902322650002202331700001702353700001602370700001802386773008802404852000902492856008802501655001202589IND4370246120221116175835.0050516s2004    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437024612DNAL7 a151152052pmid7 a10.1080/000716604100016689052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRodehutscord, M.10aLinear regression approach to study amino acid digestibility in broiler chickens  ap. 85-92.  aIncludes references  a1. An experiment was conducted to investigate whether a linear regression approach is a suitable tool for determining the amino acid (AA) digestibility up to the terminal ileum of broiler chickens. Solvent-extracted rapeseed meal (RSM) was used as the model ingredient. 2. Ten diets with 5 different inclusion rates of RSM (60, 120, 180, 240 and 300 g/kg, corresponding to crude protein concentrations from 170 to 250 g/kg in the diet), each without or with a supplementation of phytase (500 U/kg), were fed ad libitum to broiler chickens between 14 and 21 d of age. Seven pens of 12 chickens were allocated to each treatment. Digesta were sampled on a pen basis from the section of the gastrointestinal tract between Meckel's diverticulum and 2 cm anterior to the ileo-caeco-colonic junction. Titanium dioxide was included as an indigestible marker. 3. The amounts of crude protein and AAs digested up to the terminal ileum constantly increased with increasing AA intake over the entire range of intakes. When the amount of an AA digested at the terminal ileum is linearly regressed against its intake, the deviation of the slope from I is caused by both the unabsorbed AA from RSM and from specific endogenous losses related to RSM. These slopes varied between 0.68 and 0.88 for individual AAs, and the slopes were unaffected by phytase supplementation. 4. It is suggested that a linear regression approach be adopted to study the AA digestibility of raw materials in chickens. Digestibility determined this way does not need any correction for basal endogenous loss. 3abroiler chickens 3acrude protein 3adiet 3adigesta 3adigestibility 3adiverticulum 3aileum 3aingredients 3alinear models 3aphytases 3arapeseed meal 3araw materials 3atitanium dioxide 2a6-Phytasexmetabolism 2aAmino Acidsxmetabolism 2aAnimal Feed 2aAnimal Nutritional Physiological Phenomena 2aAnimals 2aBrassica rapaxmetabolism 2aChickensxmetabolism 2aDigestionxphysiology 2aLinear Models 2aMale 2aRandom Allocation1 aKapocius, M.1 aTimmler, R.1 aDieckmann, A.0 tBritish poultry science.g2004 Feb., v. 45, no. 1 p.85-92dLongmanx0007-16687nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/000716604100016689053Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03008naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002200145245006900167300001400236520172400250650002901974650001102003650001702014650001902031650001702050650001802067650002902085650001602114650001202130650001302142650001602155650000902171653002802180653002202208653002002230700001902250700002302269773014402292852000902436856008502445930003302530946001102563655001202574IND4431474720221116180025.0100115e201001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443147472DNAL7 a10.1007/s11027-009-9205-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMarland, Eric S. 12aA distributed approach to accounting for carbon in wood products  ap. 71-91.  aWith an evolving political environment of commitments to limit emissions of greenhouse gases, and of markets to trade in emissions permits, there is growing scientific, political, and economic need to accurately evaluate carbon (C) stocks and flows‚Äîespecially those related to human activities. One component of the global carbon cycle that has been contentious is the stock of carbon that is physically held in harvested wood products. The carbon stored in wood products has been sometimes overlooked, but the amount of carbon contained in wood products is not trivial, it is increasing with time, and it is significant to some Parties. This paper is concerned with accurate treatment of harvested wood products in inventories of CO‚ÇÇ emissions to the atmosphere. The methodologies outlined demonstrate a flexible way to expand current methods beyond the assumption of a simple, first-order decay to include the use of more accurate and detailed data while retaining the simplicity of simple formulas. The paper demonstrates that a more accurate representation of decay time can have significant economic implications in a system where emissions are taxed or emissions permits are traded. The method can be easily applied using only data on annual production of wood products and two parameters to characterize their expected lifetime. These methods are not specific to wood products but can be applied to long-lived, carbon-containing products from sources other than wood, e.g. long-lived petrochemical products. A single unifying approach that is both simple and flexible has the potential to be both more accurate in its results, more efficient in its implementation, and economically important to some Parties. 3aanthropogenic activities 3acarbon 3acarbon cycle 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbon sinks 3aglobal change 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3ainventories 3amarkets 3apolitics 3astored wood 3awood 0aCarbon in wood products 0aCarbon accounting 0aCO‚ÇÇ emissions1 aStellar, Kirk 1 aMarland, Gregg H. 0 tMitigation and adaptation strategies for global change.g2010 Jan., v. 15, no. 1 p.71-91dDordrecht : Springer Netherlandsx1381-23867nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11027-009-9205-63Available from publisher's Web site  a20100115b20100205c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02599naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003100092040001800123100001900141245009800160300001600258500002400274520151200298650002301810650001201833650001601845650001101861650001301872650001601885650002301901650001101924650002001935650001101955650000901966700001101975700001401986700001102000773011202011852000902123856008102132655001202213IND4368021920221116180212.0050329s2004    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436802192DNAL7 a10.1081/CSS-1200276502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBachir L, D.M.10aGenotypic difference in effect of cadmium on development and mineral concentrations of cotton  ap. 285-299.  aIncludes references  aA pot experiment was carried out in greenhouse to determine the effects of different cadmium (Cd) concentrations (0, 0.1, and 1 micromolar Cd) applied to a soil on growth parameters and genotypic variation in uptake and distribution of Cd with seven cotton genotypes (Gossypium hirsutum L.). Root length, plant height, fruiting branch number, and chlorophyll content decreased with increasing Cd concentration. On average of seven genotypes exposed to 0.1 micromolar Cd and 1 micromolar Cd treatments, plant height was reduced by 15.4 and 24.9% compared to control, respectively. Root length, chlorophyll content, leaf number were reduced by 6.8, 7.6%, and 0.2, 6.8%, and 2.6, 5.0% relative to control, respectively. Cadmium also had a significant effect on fruiting branch number, which reduced by 52.9 and 64.8% at 0.1 and 1 micrometer Cd treatments compared to the control, respectively. There was a highly significant difference in the reduction of these parameters among genotypes. Zhongmian16 was the least affected, and Simian3 was the most affected. There was a noticeable difference in the effect of Cd on mineral concentrations among seven cotton genotypes and the difference was basically coincided with varying magnitude of the root and shoot growth inhibition among genotypes. Simian3 appeared to be the most susceptible to cadmium with higher Cd concentration and lower zinc (Zn) concentration while Zhongmian16-2 the most tolerant genotype with lower Cd and higher Zn concentration in plants. 3aGossypium hirsutum 3acadmium 3achlorophyll 3acotton 3agenotype 3agreenhouses 3agrowth retardation 3aleaves 3amineral content 3ashoots 3azinc1 aWu, F.1 aZhang, G.1 aWu, H.0 tCommunications in soil science and plant analysis.g2004, v. 35, no. 1-2 p.285-299dDekkerx0010-36247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1081/CSS-1200276503Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02173naa a2200277 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003100092040001800123100001600141245008200157300001800239500002400257520131100281650001301592650001301605650001201618650001501630650001201645650002001657773011601677852000901793856008101802655001201883IND4368023020221116180157.0050329s2004    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436802302DNAL7 a10.1081/CSS-1200385542doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPardo, M.T.10aCadmium sorption-desorption by soils in the absence and presence of phosphate  ap. 1553-1568.  aIncludes references  aBatch experiments were carried out to determine the effect of phosphate anion (P) on the sorption-desorption of cadmium (Cd). The soils selected for the study were two kaolinitic Alfisols and two Andisols, which differ in their variable charge components. At the natural soil pH, Cd sorption in the absence of P was related to the net negative surface charge of the soils. Sorption of P increased the negative charge of the soils but the increase per unit amount of P added decreased with increasing P sorption. Both pH and soil characteristics influence the effect of P on Cd reactions. In the Alfisols, P and Cd were sorbed in similar amounts and the effect of increasing P rates on Cd sorption-desorption reactions was negligible. In the allophanic Andisols, whose capacity to bind P exceeds several times their capacity to retain Cd, the sorption of Cd was clearly enhanced with increasing P rates. In these soils, two distinct effects of P addition on Cd retention were observed. The first one arose from variations in the soil-suspension pH and the concomitant changes in soil surface charge. The second effect was directly related to the amount of sorbed P. Most of the Cd sorbed in the four soils was strongly bonded. In the Andisols, increasing P sorption on the surfaces restricted Cd desorption. 3aAlfisols 3aAndisols 3acadmium 3adesorption 3asoil pH 3avariable charge0 tCommunications in soil science and plant analysis.g2004, v. 35, no. 11-12 p.1553-1568dDekkerx0010-36247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1081/CSS-1200385543Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle01483naa a2200289 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001600152245005600168300001600224500002400240520058200264650002400846650002300870650002300893650002100916650001500937650002200952700001400974773009200988852000901080856009201089655001201181IND4370225120221116175851.0050516s2004    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437022512DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1442-9993.2004.01340.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrown, J.H.13aAn essay on some topics concerning invasive species  ap. 530-536.  aIncludes references  aThere is a tendency for both scientists and lay people to regard invading alien species as inherently ‚Äòbad' and native species as inherently ‚Äògood.'

A prolonged parasite clearance time conferred by dhfr and dhps mutations is believed to be responsible for increased gametocyte prevalence in SP treated individuals. However, using a direct feeding assay in Mali, we showed that gametocytes present in peripheral venous blood post-SP treatment had reduced infectivity for Anopheles gambiae sensu stricto (ss) mosquitoes. We investigated the potential mechanisms involved in the dhfr and dhps quintuple mutant NF-135 and the single dhps 437 mutant NF-54. Concentrations of sulfadoxine (S) and pyrimethamine (P) equivalent to the serum levels of the respective drugs on day 3 (S=61Œºg/ml, P=154.7ng/ml) day 7 (S=33.8Œºg/ml, P=66.6ng/ml) and day 14 (S=14.2Œºg/ml, P=15.7ng/ml) post-SP treatment were used to study the effect on gametocytogenesis, gametocyte maturation and infectivity to Anopheles stephensi mosquitoes fed through an artificial membrane. The drugs readily induced gametocytogenesis in the mutant NF-135 strain but effectively killed the wild-type NF-54. However, both drugs impaired gametocyte maturation yielding odd-shaped non-exflagellating mature gametocytes. The concomitant ingestion of both S and P together with gametocytemic blood-meal significantly reduced the prevalence of oocyst positivity as well as oocyst density when compared to controls (P <0.001). In addition, day 3 concentrations of SP decreased mosquito survival by up to 65% (P <0.001). This study demonstrates that SP is deleterious in vitro for gametocyte infectivity as well as mosquito survival.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAnopheles gambiae 3aAnopheles stephensi 3aPlasmodium falciparum 3ablood meal 3ablood serum 3adrugs 3agametocytes 3ainfancy 3aingestion 3amutants 3amutation 3aoocysts 3aparasites 3apathogenicity 3apregnancy 3apyrimethamine 3asulfadoxine 3aMali1 aVegte-Bolmer, Marga van de1 aSiebelink-Stoter, Rianne1 aGemert, Geert-Jan van1 aDara, Antoine1 aNiangaly, Hamidou1 aLuty, Adrian1 aDoumbo, Ogobara K.1 aSauerwein, Robert1 aDjimde, Abdoulaye A.0 tInternational journal for parasitology.g2010 Aug. 15, v. 40, no. 10 p.1221-1228d[Oxford; New York]: Elsevier Sciencex0020-75197nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijpara.2010.05.0043Available from publisher's Web site  aNon-US 7aarticle01547naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130100002000148245009100168300001800259520055400277650002500831650001000856650001600866650001000882650001100892650001300903650001400916650001600930700002700946773014000973852000901113856008801122946001101210655001201221IND4439663920221116175938.0100709e20100815xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443966392DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijpara.2010.04.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWoods, Debra J.10aDiscovery of veterinary antiparasitic agents in the 21st Century: A view from industry  ap. 1177-1181.  aDiscovery of antiparasitic agents is a challenging process, requiring discovery of molecules with the ability to kill parasites but not their hosts.

Nutritional rehabilitation was attempted with continuous naso-gastric feeding of an elemental diet. The energy needs of the patients were shown to be 25-80% higher than in healthy individuals of the same age, sex and size. Lean body mass as judged by measurement of total body potassium and nitrogen was relatively well preserved, but there was significant wasting of adipose tissue. During the short period of refeeding, body weight, fat and potassium all increased significantly, while fat free body mass and total body nitrogen did not change. A model is proposed for the aetiology of undernutrition in the adolescent and young adult cystic with deteriorating lung function. Based on this model and the finding of the short-term N/G refeeding program described in this paper, we have embarked on a long-term supplementation study in malnourished CF patients who do not respond to dietary counselling and oral supplementation.

Drug resistance can arise in many different ways, but recent developments highlight the importance of mutations in transporter molecules as being major contributors to drug resistance in the human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum. While approximately 2.5% of the P. falciparum genome encodes membrane transporters, this review concentrates on three transporters, namely the chloroquine resistance transporter PfCRT, the multi-drug resistance transporter 1 PfMDR1, and the multi-drug resistance-associated protein PfMRP, which have been strongly associated with resistance to the major antimalarial drugs. The studies that identified these entities as contributors to resistance, and the possible molecular mechanisms that can bring about this phenotype, are discussed. A deep understanding of the underpinning mechanisms, and of the structural specificities of the players themselves, is a necessary basis for the development of the new drugs that will be needed for the future armamentarium against malaria. 3aPlasmodium falciparum 3achloroquine 3agenome 3ahumans 3amalaria 3amultiple drug resistance 3amutation 3anew drugs 3aparasites 3aphenotype 3atransporters1 aDave, Anurag1 aStein, Wilfred D.1 aLanzer, Michael0 tInternational journal for parasitology.g2010 Aug. 15, v. 40, no. 10 p.1109-1118d[Oxford; New York]: Elsevier Sciencex0020-75197nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijpara.2010.04.0013Available from publisher's Web site  aNon-US 7aarticle03527naa a2200685 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100002600171245009900197300001600296520138100312650001301693650000801706650002901714650001401743650001201757650001701769650001401786650001001800650003701810650001001847650001601857650001401873650002401887650002001911650001401931650001401945650002801959650001301987650001502000650001702015650001302032650001102045650002402056650005302080650001502133650004202148650002602190650002202216650001802238650003402256650002602290650004002316650002502356650006302381650006102444653002402505653000802529700003102537773011602568852000902684856009202693930003302785946001102818655001202829IND4439657520221116180017.0100709e201008  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443965752DNAL7 a204919362pmid7 a10.1111/j.1567-1364.2010.00628.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLauff, Diana Beatr√≠z10aPotassium deprivation is sufficient to induce a cell death program in Saccharomyces cerevisiae  ap. 497-507.  aCell culture in low potassium (K‚Å∫) media has been associated to programmed cell death (PCD) in metazoans. In this study, deprivation of K‚Å∫ led Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells to a death process that involved phosphatidylserine externalization, changes in chromatin condensation, DNA and vacuole fragmentation as well as enhanced accumulation of reactive oxygen species. During the course of K‚Å∫ starvation, plasma membrane hyperpolarization and increased accumulation of calcium (Ca¬≤‚Å∫) took place. The presence of rubidium (Rb‚Å∫), a K‚Å∫-analogue element, in the K‚Å∫-deprived medium was accompanied by Rb‚Å∫ accumulation but did not fully prevent the appearance of PCD markers. This argues for a specific effect of K‚Å∫ on the course of cell death. While the absence of the YCA1 metacaspase did not have a major effect, the absence of TRK (transport of K‚Å∫) K‚Å∫-transporters led to changes in the pattern of annexin V/propidium iodide labeling. This change paralleled a fast accumulation of Ca¬≤‚Å∫. Addition of ethylene glycol tetraacetic acid improved growth and reduced cell death in trk1Œîtrk2Œî cells. These findings reveal that K‚Å∫ deprivation is sufficient to induce PCD in a cell-walled eukaryotic organism and suggest that the phenotype attributed to the lack of TRK genes is partially due to the effect of the encoded transporters on Ca¬≤‚Å∫ homeostasis. 3aAnimalia 3aDNA 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3aapoptosis 3acalcium 3acell culture 3achromatin 3adeath 3aethylene glycol tetraacetic acid 3agenes 3ahomeostasis 3aphenotype 3aphosphatidylserines 3aplasma membrane 3apotassium 3apropidium 3areactive oxygen species 3arubidium 3astarvation 3atransporters 3avacuoles 3ayeasts 2aCalciumxmetabolism 2aCation Transport Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aCell Death 2aCell Membranexchemistryxphysiology. 2aChromatinxmetabolism 2aDNA Fragmentation 2aGene Deletion 2aPhosphatidylserinesxanalysis 2aPotassiumxmetabolism 2aReactive Oxygen Speciesxmetabolism 2aRubidiumxmetabolism 2aSaccharomyces cerevisiaexchemistryxcytologyxmetabolism. 2aSaccharomyces cerevisiae Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 0apotassium transport 0aTRK1 aSanta-Mar√≠a, Guillermo E.0 tFEMS yeast research.g2010 Aug., v. 10, no. 5 p.497-507dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx1567-13567nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1567-1364.2010.00628.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20100709b20100807c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01715naa a2200529 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024001800097040001800115100001500133245010000148300001600248300002400264520021500288650001700503650002500520650002300545650002800568650001200596650002000608650001400628650001300642650001200655650002000667650002300687650002900710650002900739650001000768650001100778650003600789650004400825650001800869650001900887650001700906651001100923700001200934700001900946700001900965700001700984773010901001852000901110939003301119945000801152946001301160655001201173991590617960742620221116180006.0901123e199002  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI900015682DNAL7 a21060202pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSveger, T.10aApolipoprotein A-I:B ratio and B screening: A preliminary study of 10- and 11-year-old children  ap. 179-184.  ap. 179-184. charts.  aThe purpose of this study was to trace children with familial hypercholesterolemia.

Both larger size and a non-burrowing habit independently increased susceptibility to colonization. In 2005, over 50% of the final instars of the sprawlers Didymops transversa and Hagenius brevistylus were colonized, as well as younger instars. Rarely colonized were Progomphus obscurus and Dromogomphus spinosus, whose larvae burrow under sand, and the sprawler Epitheca princeps, whose final instars were lightly covered with sand. Hagenius larvae that had been preyed upon carried more mussels than those dying of other causes. More generally, mussel attachment decreased the probability that sprawlers left the water to emerge, the distance that some species traveled before emerging, and the ability of an overturned sprawler to right itself. On average, final instars of Didymops and Hagenius remaining in the water carried three times as many mussels as individuals known to emerge. Compared to uncolonized individuals, Epitheca and Progomphus with mussels emerged closer to the water line. Among colonized Didymops, the distance traveled on land before emerging decreased with increasing mussel load. Of the colonized Didymops that could right themselves, righting time increased with mussel load. Because the two common species of sprawlers were disproportionately colonized, and mussel attachment decreased their chances of emerging, our results suggest that D. polymorpha has the potential to affect the community structure of this guild of aquatic and terrestrial predators. 3aAnisoptera (Odonata) 3aDreissena polymorpha 3aburrows 3acommunity structure 3ainstars 3alarvae 3amussels 3apredators 3aprobability 3asand 3asurvival rate 3aLake Michigan1 aSantiago, Diana1 aHickner, Stephen1 aBienek, Rosalie0 tHydrobiologia.g2009 May, v. 624, no. 1 p.71-79dSpringer Netherlandsx0018-81587nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-008-9667-7 7aarticle02959naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001500110245004100125500015100166500002400317520148700341650001601828650001201844650001301856650001501869650003701884650002301921650001801944650001001962650002001972650002201992650001802014650001102032650001202043650002002055650000902075650001102084650001302095650001002108700001502118700001902133700001302152700001502165700001702180700001402197700001702211773013002228852000902358856008602367655001202453IND4464787520221116175407.0130114s2002    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446478752DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAbbott, A.10aPeach: the model genome for Rosaceae  aPaper presented at the International Symposium on Tropical and Subtropical Fruits, volume 1, held November 26-December 1, 2000, Cairns, Australia.  aIncludes references  aFor genome comparative studies and identification of important genes, it is critical to have adequate genomic resources in key model species. These resources include saturated genetic maps, large-insert genomic libraries, and physicalmaps that are integrated with the genetic maps. Such resources exist for Brassicaceae (Arabidopsis), Solanaceae (tomato) and the Poaceae (rice), but not for Rosaceae. In Rosaceae, we are building genomic resources in a tree species (peach) with a genome size only twice that of Arabidopsis. Our goal is to develop peach as a model for identification, characterization, and cloning of important genes of Rosaceae species. Consequently, we have produced saturated molecular marker linkage maps in several peach crosses segregating for important traits, both simple and complex. Because fruit quality is the single most important character to scion breeders, we have concentrated on mapping important fruit quality traits. The mapped molecular markers serve as landmarks for isolation of genes associated with important traits, and facilitate their maintenance during introgression of other tree characters, such as disease and pest resistance.

The macadamia industry prefers M. integrifolia, although hybrid cultivars do occur. There are preliminary results to indicate that breeders may be able to exploit hybrid vigour, but to advance these studies, hybrid status must first be resolved. At present, species allocation is diagnosed on the basis of a few morphological traits, but this is inadequate to resolve proportional contributions of each species to each hybrid genotype. Neither can morphology be used to distinguish each cultivar or satisfactorily organise the complicated array of available cultivars. Such gaps in our knowledge may be filled by application of new DNA marker technologies. Radiolabelled DNA amplification fingerprinting (RAF) is a DNA marker technique recently applied to macadamia chromosome mapping. Here we demonstrate RAF to be a simple technique for identifying highly informative codominant markers in macadamia. We have discovered 19 new RAF codominant markers, which were used together with dominant markers to characterise 30 cultivars representative of the macadamia industry. Individual identity was assigned to each cultivar, and species proportions were calculated. Many cultivars contained a higher degree of M. tetraphylla than was previously thought. The markers were also used to assign cultivars to germplasm groups that reflected species status and breeding origins. Species composition was found to be a major determinant of group distinction. We now have a simple screening procedure for characterising macadamia germplasm. 3aDNA 3aMacadamia integrifolia 3achromosome mapping 3acultivars 3agenotype 3agermplasm 3aheterosis 3ahybrids 3aindigenous species 3aindustry 3aspecies diversity1 aVithanage, V.1 aTurnbull, C.1 aCarroll, B.J.0 tActa horticulturae.g2002 Apr., , no. 575dInternational Society for Horticultural SciencewJournal:jnl46289x0567-75727nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.actahort.org/books/575/575_42.htm3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle01605naa a2200265 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002200110245005500132500015100187500002400338520063300362650001900995650001801014650002001032650001301052650001401065650002301079773013001102852000901232856008601241655001201327IND4464790320221116175452.0130114s2002    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446479032DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKhalid, M.Z.

The first perennial fruit-breeding program focused on grapevines and though directed mainly at varieties suitable for temperate and Mediterranean climatic regions, table grape selections have been identified for evaluation in tropical and subtropical areas. In addition, Marroo seedless, a CSIRO variety with field resistance to downy mildew and a high level of fruitfulness under tropical conditions, has been adopted to a limited extent in northern Australia. Breeding objectives for tropical and subtropical grapes include disease tolerance and adaptations to lower chill regimes to ensure uniform budburst and flowering. Genetic improvement programs have also been conducted for a range of other perennial horticultural species including citrus, avocado, mango, cashew, macadamia, guava, annonas, lychee and longan. Some of these are clearly suited to tropical and subtropical production regions while others are more ubiquitous in their adaptive range being suited to temperate, Mediterranean as well warmer climates. For example, mango breeding is directed at new varieties for the tropics and subtropics, while the citrus program focuses on key fruit quality characteristics that will lead to marketing advantages regardless of where the varieties are grown. This paper presents a review of some of CSIRO's conventional fruit breeding activities. Research of significance for tropical and subtropical regions as well as breeding methodologies are highlighted with reference to biological characteristics, such as flowering, juvenility and tree size, which influence research outputs and the delivery of key outcomes to industry. 3aCitrus 3aMacadamia 3aavocados 3adisease resistance 3adowny mildew 3aflowering 3afruit quality 3agenetic improvement 3agrapes 3ahorticulture 3aindustry 3ajuvenility 3amangoes 3amarketing 3anew variety 3aresearch management 3asubtropics 3atree breeding 3atrees 3atropics 3aAustralia0 tActa horticulturae.g2002 Apr., , no. 575dInternational Society for Horticultural SciencewJournal:jnl46289x0567-75727nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.actahort.org/books/575/575_34.htm3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02921naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001900110245009200129500015100221500002400372500001500396520138700411650001601798650001901814650002501833650001001858650001201868650001201880650001401892650002101906650002101927650000901948650001601957650001101973650001501984650001301999650002202012650002702034651001802061651001002079651001202089651001702101651001002118653001902128700001802147700002502165773013002190852000902320856008602329655001202415IND4464789920221116175339.0130114s2002    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446478992DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aScheldeman, X.10aImproving cherimoya (Annona cherimola Mill.) cultivation exploring its centre of origin  aPaper presented at the International Symposium on Tropical and Subtropical Fruits, volume 1, held November 26-December 1, 2000, Cairns, Australia.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-05  aLoja province (southern Ecuador) is generally acknowledged to be located at the centre of origin of cherimoya (Annona cherimola Mill.), one of the promising Andean fruits that is cultivated on an increasing scale, with countries like Spain, Chile and United States showing growing interest in its commercialisation. A global study of cherimoya characteristics in Loja province conducted from January 1996 till September 1999 provided valuable information for future crop development. Germplasm collection (137 accessions) and characterization showed great variability in fruit characteristics (fruit weight, seed index, soluble solids and botanical form). A number of promising accessions were revealed that could easily compete, in preliminary comparisons, with five commercial cultivars ("Fino de Jete", "Bays", "White", "Bronceada" and "Concha Lisa") from cherimoya exporting countries. Determination of optimal edaphoclimatological growing conditions of wild cherimoya trees gives an indication of the soil (pH, organic matter and texture) and climate (temperature and precipitation) preferences of the species. Suitability maps based on this information prove to be useful tools in locating possible sites for the establishment of commercial plantations. Exploring in detail a crop's centre of origin could facilitate considerably future breeding and crop development programs. 3aplantations 3aorganic matter 3atotal soluble solids 3atrees 3atexture 3aclimate 3acultivars 3aAnnona cherimola 3acenter of origin 3asoil 3atemperature 3afruits 3acherimoyas 3abreeding 3acommercialization 3agermplasm conservation 3aUnited States 3aChile 3aEcuador 3aAndes region 3aSpain 0asoluble solids1 aVan Damme, P.1 aUre√±a Alvarez, J.V.0 tActa horticulturae.g2002 Apr., , no. 575dInternational Society for Horticultural SciencewJournal:jnl46289x0567-75727nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.actahort.org/books/575/575_37.htm3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03053naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245011800126500015100244500002400395520170100419650001502120650001102135650001302146650001702159650001602176650002302192650001602215650001002231650001502241650001802256650001602274650001102290650001002301650001502311650000902326650001002335650001902345650001602364651001402380773013002394852000902524856008602533655001202619IND4464791920221116175352.0130115s2002    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446479192DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFay, H.A.C.10aFruitpiercing moths and fruitspotting bugs: intractable pests of tree fruits in a reduced-insecticide environment  aPaper presented at the International Symposium on Tropical and Subtropical Fruits, volume 2, held November 26-December 1, 2000, Cairns, Australia.  aIncludes references  aPublished and unpublished information on fruitpiercing moths (Eudocima spp.) and fruitspotting bugs (Amblypelta spp.) is presented to highlight the difficulties in managing these insects in Australia, where there is an ongoing emphasis on the reduced use of broad-spectrum insecticides in tree fruit production. These important polyphagous pests of tree crops possess piercing mouthparts which enable them to penetrate the skin or rind of most fruit, the damage resulting in lost crop or unmarketable product. Between them, fruitpiercing moths (FPM) and fruitspotting bugs (FSB) feed on around 40 different cultivated fruits or nuts, and crop losses greater than 50% have been attributed to each on occasions. Control of FPM with insecticides is difficult, and so alternative methods have been sought to combat these pests. Netting trees and bagging fruits can be totally effective, but are not economical options for most crops unless other significant pests (e.g. birds, flying foxes) are controlled too. Light protection systems can reduce damage by 60-70%, while a new baiting system has provided 75-85% protection in citrus trials. FSB have traditionally been controlled with prophylactic applications of endosulfan, but restrictions on the use of this chemical and a greater reliance on crop scouting have resulted in a general reduction in insecticide use. Further rationalisation may occur if it can be shown that fruit loss due to bug damage does not increase that resulting from natural thinning. While some work on biological control of both pests has been undertaken, future research could also focus on sex pheromones, plant attractants and novel insecticidal or repellent compounds. 3aAmblypelta 3aCitrus 3aEudocima 3aPteropodidae 3aattractants 3abiological control 3acrop losses 3acrops 3aendosulfan 3afruit growing 3afruit trees 3afruits 3amoths 3amouthparts 3anuts 3apests 3asex pheromones 3atree fruits 3aAustralia0 tActa horticulturae.g2002 Apr., , no. 575dInternational Society for Horticultural SciencewJournal:jnl46289x0567-75727nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.actahort.org/books/575/575_56.htm3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02493naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245009500126500015100221500002400372520128100396650002701677650002001704650001201724650001901736650002401755650002401779650001901803650000901822650001401831650001601845700001501861700001401876700001601890773013001906852000902036856008602045655001202131IND4464791620221116175235.0130115s2002    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446479162DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTan, K.S.R.10aEffects of fertiliser on the susceptibility of durian and papaya to Phytophthora palmivora  aPaper presented at the International Symposium on Tropical and Subtropical Fruits, volume 2, held November 26-December 1, 2000, Cairns, Australia.  aIncludes references  aA complete liquid inorganic fertiliser (Vitall(TM)) and organic composted chicken manure were compared in pot trials for their effects on the growth of papaya, and on the susceptibility of papaya and durian to disease caused by Phytophthora palmivora. A single application of 2.5% chicken manure, or regular applications of Vitall led to increased growth in papaya seedlings over a 3-month period, compared to seedlings grown in unfertilised vermiculite/sand (50:50). Regular applications of half the recommended rate of Vitall produced the largest seedlings. Root dry weights were greater in fertilised than in unfertilised treatments, but did not differ between the inorganic and organic fertilisers. In contrast to the Vitall treatments, the incorporation of chicken manure into the potting mix led to increased survival of P. palmivora-infected papaya and durian seedlings, stimulated root regeneration in papaya after infection with P. palmivora, and the reduction of P. palmivora in the potting mix to undetectable levels within 4 weeks. The improved survival of infected papaya and durian grown in chicken manure amended potting mix was attributed to the higher levels of antagonistic microorganisms, such as actinomycetes, which led to the suppression of the pathogen. 3aPhytophthora palmivora 3adisease control 3adurians 3amicroorganisms 3amineral fertilizers 3aorganic fertilizers 3apoultry manure 3asand 3aseedlings 3avermiculite1 aO'Gara, E.1 aGuest, D.1 aVawdrey, L.0 tActa horticulturae.g2002 Apr., , no. 575dInternational Society for Horticultural SciencewJournal:jnl46289x0567-75727nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.actahort.org/books/575/575_53.htm3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03495naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003100092024002200123024001900145040001800164100002300182245012400205300001800329506007600347520182500423506003702248650001202285650002102297650001602318650002302334650001302357650001102370650001302381650001802394650002502412650001702437650001402454650002002468650002202488650000902510650001102519650001202530650002102542650002002563650001902583650001302602650001202615650001402627700002402641700002302665700002202688773007302710852000902783856008102792930003302873946001102906655001202917IND4374688120221207062155.0050925e200510  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437468812DNAL7 a10.1093/glycob/cwi0892doi7 aPMC13602282pmcid7 a159584162pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHurd, Elizabeth A.10aGastrointestinal mucins of Fut2-null mice lack terminal fucosylation without affecting colonization by Candida albicans  ap. 1002-1007.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aPosttranslational modification of apomucins by the sequential action of glycosyltransferases is required to produce mature mucins. The Secretor gene (FUT2) encodes an [alpha](1,2)fucosyltransferase (EC 2.4.1.69) that catalyzes addition of terminal [alpha](1,2)fucose residues on mucins and other molecules in mucosal epithelium. Mutant mice containing targeted replacement of Fut2 with the bacterial reporter gene lacZ were studied to determine the affect of the loss of Fut2 on glycosylation of mucins in the gastrointestinal tract. By whole organ X-gal staining, lacZ activity is prominently expressed in the foveolar pit and chief cells of the glandular stomach, Brunner's glands of the duodenum, and goblet cells in the large intestine of Fut2-LacZ-null mice. Staining with Aleuria aurantia agglutinin demonstrates loss of L-fucosylated epithelial glycans throughout the gastrointestinal tract of Fut2-LacZ-null mice, however, histologic appearance of the tissues appears normal. Analysis of oligosaccharides released from insoluble colonic mucins, largely Muc2, by mass spectrometry shows complete lack of terminal fucosylation of O-linked oligosaccharides in Fut2-LacZ-null mice. Precursor glycans accumulate with no evidence of compensation by other fucosyltransferases or sialyltransferases on mucin glycosylation. Because Candida albicans has been reported to adhere to intestinal mucins creating a potential reservoir associated with vaginitis, Fut2-LacZ-null and wild-type mice were inoculated by gastric lavage with C. albicans. We observe no difference in colonization between genotypes suggesting mucin terminal fucosylation does not significantly influence C. albicans-host interaction in the intestine, highlighting that infections caused by the same organism at different mucosal surfaces are not equal.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAleuria 3aCandida albicans 3aagglutinins 3acatalytic activity 3aduodenum 3afucose 3agenotype 3aglycosylation 3aglycosyltransferases 3agoblet cells 3ahistology 3alarge intestine 3amass spectrometry 3amice 3amucins 3amutants 3aoligosaccharides 3apolysaccharides 3areporter genes 3astaining 3astomach 3avaginitis1 aHolm√©n, Jessica M.1 aHansson, Gunnar C.1 aDomino, Steven E.0 tGlycobiology.g2005 Oct., v. 15, no. 10 p.1002-1007x0959-66587nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/glycob/cwi0893Available from publisher's Web site  a20050925b00000000c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03047naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245007300127300001800200500001500218520198400233650001602217650002402233650001702257650001102274650001102285650002002296651001202316653001702328653002102345653001502366653002002381653001502401700001702416700001702433700001802450773010102468852000902569930003302578945001302611946001302624655001202637IND2047374920221116175305.0950818e199505  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204737492DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPeters, D.L.10aRunoff production in a forested, shallow soil, Canadian shield basin  ap. 1291-1304.  a2019-12-05  aStorm flow in forested basins on the Canadian Shield is largely supplied by subsurface water; however, mechanisms by which this water reaches the stream remain unclear. Side slope contributions to storm flow were studied using throughflow trenches on slopes in a headwater basin near Dorset, Ontario. Discharge, soil water content, and chemical and isotopic signatures of subsurface water were monitored at each site. Four hypotheses were tested: (1) most flow occurs at the soil-bedrock interface on shield slopes with thin soil; (2) a significant fraction of event water moves vertically to bedrock via preferential flow pathways and laterally over the bedrock surface; (3) relative pre-event water contribution to subsurface flow on shield slopes is a function of soil thickness; and (4) a significant portion of event water flux in storm flow from forested basins with shallow soil cover is supplied from side slopes via subsurface flow along the soil-bedrock interface. Hypothesis 1 was confirmed from hydrometric observations during spring and fall rainstorms. Hypotheses 2 and 3 were supported by temporal trends in dissolved organic carbon and 18O in flow at the soil-bedrock interface and by isotopic hydrograph separations (IHSs) of hillslope runoff. Comparison with the streamflow IHS indicated that event water flux from the basin in excess of that attributable to direct precipitation onto near-channel saturated areas could be supplied by flow along the bedrock surface (hypothesis 4). Flow at the soil-bedrock interface on side slopes also contributed approximately 25% of pre-event water flux from the basin. Much of the event water component of basin storm flow may travel considerable distances via subsurface routes and is not necessarily contributed by surface runoff processes (Horton flow or saturation overland flow). Therefore the assumption that event water undergoes little interaction with the soil during its passage downslope may be unwarranted here. 3astream flow 3awatershed hydrology 3aforest soils 3astorms 3arunoff 3asubsurface flow 3aOntario 0asloping land 0asubsurface water 0awater flow 0amicrocatchments 0astorm flow1 aButtle, J.M.1 aTaylor, C.H.1 aLazerte, B.D.0 tWater resources research.g1995 May, v. 31, no. 5 p.1291-1304wJournal:jnl46306x0043-13977nnas  aDNAL  a19950905b19950912c00000000  aINDdGHK  aOther US 7aarticle01821naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245008400127300001800211500001500229520095000244650001401194650001301208650001501221650001501236653001901251700001801270700001701288700002101305773010101326852000901427930003301436945001301469946001301482655001201495IND2047374720221116175231.0950818e199505  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204737472DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aParkin, G.W.10aAnalytical solution for one-dimensional drainage: water stored in a fixed depth  ap. 1267-1271.  a2019-12-05  aWe present a quasi-analytical solution for drainage of water from a fixed depth of soil near the surface of a deeply wetted profile. The solution is an application of a previously published nonlinear constant rate rainfall infiltration solution and includes capillary and gravity effects. The solution is sensitive to its three hydrologic parameters (including a macroscopic capillary length and the saturated hydraulic conductivity) and is numerically stable for a wide range of parameter values. We develop an analytical form of the hydraulic gradient and flux density of water during drainage at any depth and time using the same drainage solution. The duration of unit hydraulic gradient is strongly dependent on the soil's hydrologic parameters. Generalized forms of the water storage, water content, and flux density given here can show the effects of an infinite combination of parameter values in single plots of each dimensionless form. 3aequations 3adrainage 3asoil water 3asoil depth 0asurface layers1 aWarrick, A.W.1 aElrick, D.E.1 aKachanoski, R.G.0 tWater resources research.g1995 May, v. 31, no. 5 p.1267-1271wJournal:jnl46306x0043-13977nnas  aDNAL  a19950905b19950912c00000000  aINDdGHK  aOther US 7aarticle02705naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003100111040001800142100001900160245013600179300001800315520100000333650002401333650002301357650002201380650002401402650004301426650002101469650002001490650002201510650001201532650001401544650004101558650003401599650005001633650003601683650001101719650002201730650002401752650004401776650001701820700002201837700002301859700001801882700002001900700001901920700001701939773007301956852000902029856008102038939003302119946001102152655001202163IND4374688720221116175301.0050925e200510  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437468872DNAL7 a159584182pmid7 a10.1093/glycob/cwi0922doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYagi, Hirokazu10aDevelopment of structural analysis of sulfated N-glycans by multidimensional high performance liquid chromatography mapping methods  ap. 1051-1060.  aAlthough the biological importance of sulfated oligosaccharides has been widely recognized, there are only a few reports that describe detailed structures of sulfated N-glycans. This is largely due to the lack of a convenient method to identify structures of sulfated glycans found in low incidence. Here we develop multidimensional high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) mapping methods for rapid and convenient identification of sulfated N-glycans. By using adequate quantities of sulfated N-glycans derived from LS12 cells, which are transfected with sulfotransferase cDNA, 40 different sulfated glycans have been successfully mapped. Furthermore, we have applied the HPLC data to identification of isomeric products resulting from an enzymatic reaction of N-acetylglucosamine 6-O-sulfotransferase-1 in vitro and revealed that this enzyme preferentially catalyzes sulfation of the GlcNAc{szligbeta}1[rightwards arrow]2Man[alpha]1[rightwards arrow]3Man branch in a biantennary acceptor. 3aN-acetylglucosamine 3acatalytic activity 3acomplementary DNA 3aenzymatic reactions 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3aoligosaccharides 3apolysaccharides 3asulfotransferases 2aAnimals 2aCell Line 2aChromatography, High Pressure Liquid 2aFucosyltransferasesxgenetics 2aGlucansxchemistryxisolation & purification. 2aGlycoside Hydrolasesxchemistry 2aHumans 2aMass Spectrometry 2aMolecular Structure 2aSulfotransferasesxchemistryxgenetics. 2aTransfection1 aTakahashi, Noriko1 aYamaguchi, Yoshiki1 aKimura, Naoko1 aUchimura, Kenji1 aKannagi, Reiji1 aKato, Koichi0 tGlycobiology.g2005 Oct., v. 15, no. 10 p.1051-1060x0959-66587nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/glycob/cwi0923Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b00000000c20111102  aNon-US 7aarticle02695naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002000110245009900130300001800229520169900247650001801946650003701964650001702001650002502018650001302043650002402056650001702080650001202097653001602109700001502125700002602140700001402166773008502180852000902265930003302274945001302307946001302320655001202333IND2048793320221116175253.0951116e199509  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204879332DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVandevivere, P.10aMicrobial clogging of saturated soils and aquifer materials: evaluation of mathematical models  ap. 2173-2180.  aBacterial reductions of the saturated hydraulic conductivity of natural porous media appear to be caused by a wide range of mechanisms, few of which have been carefully studied. Nevertheless, a number of mathematical models have been developed in recent years to describe the microbial clogging process, based on the assumption that bacterial cells form impermeable biofilms uniformly covering pore walls. In the present study, two independent sets of experimental data available in the literature are used to test the existing bioclogging models. To broaden the scope of the assessment, an additional model, initially developed to describe the deep filtration of suspended colloids, is also included in the comparisons. Analysis of the experimental data reveals a clear relationship between the texture of a porous medium and the ability of a given level of biomass to reduce its saturated hydraulic conductivity; at equal biomass, clogging is much more pronounced in fine-textured materials than in coarse-textured ones. In addition, the results of the model comparisons suggest that none of the existing models can predict satisfactorily the saturated hydraulic conductivity reductions observed in fine sands, whereas they fare somewhat better in coarser materials. It is argued that this inadequacy of existing models is due to the continuous biofilm assumption on which they are founded. Indeed, a simplistic model that assumes the biomass to be distributed as plugs instead of as continuous biofilms produces quantitatively much improved predictions of the saturated hydraulic conductivity reductions. Reference is made to the consequences of this observation in terms of future research. 3asoil bacteria 3asaturated hydraulic conductivity 3asoil texture 3asaturated conditions 3aaquifers 3amathematical models 3aporous media 3abiofilm 0abioclogging1 aBaveye, P.1 aSanchez de Lozada, D.1 aDeLeo, P.0 tWater resources research.g1995 Sept., v. 31, no. 9 p.2173-2180x0043-13977nnas  aDNAL  a19960102b19960111c00000000  aINDdGHK  aOther US 7aarticle03192naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003100092040001800123100001900141245019900160300001600359520153800375650002101913650001701934650001101951650002101962650001501983650002001998650001002018650001602028650002502044650004302069650001902112650002402131650002302155650001302178650001202191650004402203650000702247650001402254650001102268700002202279700002902301700002202330700002502352700002302377700002402400700002202424773007002446852000902516856008102525930003302606946001102639655001202650IND4370815720221116175738.0050529e200506  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437081572DNAL7 a10.1093/glycob/cwi0382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRiley, John G.14aThe wbbD gene of E. coli strain VW187 (O7:K1) encodes a UDP-Gal: GlcNAc[alpha]-pyrophosphate-R {szligbeta}1,3-galactosyltransferase involved in the biosynthesis of O7-specific lipopolysaccharide  ap. 605-613.  aIn this work, we demonstrate that the wbbD gene of the O7 lipopolysaccharide (LPS) biosynthesis cluster in Escherichia coli strain VW187 (O7:K1) encodes a galactosyltransferase involved in the synthesis of the O7-polysaccharide repeating unit. The galactosyltransferase catalyzed the transfer of Gal from UDP-Gal to the GlcNAc residue of a GlcNAc-pyrophosphate-lipid acceptor. A mutant strain with a defective wbbD gene was unable to form O7 LPS and lacked this specific galactosyltransferase activity. The normal phenotype was restored by complementing the mutant with the cloned wbbD gene. To characterize the WbbD galactosyltransferase, we used a novel acceptor substrate containing GlcNAc[alpha]-pyrophosphate covalently bound to a hydrophobic phenoxyundecyl moiety (GlcNAc [alpha]-O-PO‚ÇÉ-PO‚ÇÉ-(CH‚ÇÇ)‚ÇÅ‚ÇÅ-O-phenyl). The WbbD galactosyltransferase had optimal activity at pH 7 in the presence of 2.5 mM MnCl‚ÇÇ. Detergents in the assay did not increase glycosyl transfer. Digestion of enzyme product by highly purified bovine testicular {szligbeta}-galactosidase demonstrated a {szligbeta}-linkage. Cleavage of product by pyrophosphatase and phosphatase, followed by HPLC and NMR analyses, revealed a disaccharide with the structure Gal {szligbeta}1-3GlcNAc. Our results conclusively demonstrate that WbbD is a UDP-Gal: GlcNAc[alpha]-pyrophosphate-R {szligbeta}1,3-galactosyltransferase and suggest that the novel synthetic glycolipid acceptor may be generally applicable to characterize other bacterial glycosyltransferases. 3aEscherichia coli 3abiosynthesis 3acattle 3achemical bonding 3adetergents 3aenzyme activity 3agenes 3aglycolipids 3aglycosyltransferases 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3ahydrophobicity 3alipopolysaccharides 3amanganese chloride 3amoieties 3amutants 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3apH 3aphenotype 3atestes1 aMenggad, Mohammed1 aMontoya-Peleaz, Pedro J.1 aSzarek, Walter A.1 aMarolda, Cristina L.1 aValvano, Miguel A.1 aSchutzbach, John S.1 aBrockhausen, Inka0 tGlycobiology.g2005 June, v. 15, no. 6 p.605-613x0959-66587nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/glycob/cwi0383Available from publisher's Web site  a20050529b20050604c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02661naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003100092040001800123100001800141245010000159300001600259520149400275650001801769650001001787650003901797650001001836650002101846650000901867650003101876650001201907650002101919650001301940650001201953700001701965700002101982700002102003700002302024773007002047852000902117856008102126930003302207946001102240655001202251IND4370816020221116175608.0050529e200506  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437081602DNAL7 a10.1093/glycob/cwi0422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCho, Steve K.10aCharacterization of lipid-linked oligosaccharide accumulation in mouse models of Batten disease  ap. 637-648.  aThe neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses (NCLs, also known collectively as Batten disease) are a group of lysosomal storage disorders characterized by the accumulation of autofluorescent storage material in the brain and other tissues. A number of genes underlying various forms of NCL have been cloned, but the basis for the neurodegeneration in any of these is unknown. High levels of dolichol pyrophosphoryl oligosaccharides have previously been demonstrated in brain tissue from several NCL patients, but the specificity of the effect for the NCLs has been unclear. In the present study, we examine eight mouse models of lysosomal storage disorders by modern FACE and found striking lipid-linked oligosaccharide (LLO) accumulation in NCL mouse models (especially CLN1, CLN6, and CLN8 knockout or mutant mice) but not in several other lysosomal storage disorders affecting the brain. Using a mouse model of the most severe form of NCL (the PPT1 knockout mouse), we show that accumulated LLOs are not the result of a defect in LLO synthesis, extension, or transfer but rather are catabolic intermediates derived from LLO degradation. LLOs are enriched about 60-fold in the autofluorescent storage material purified from PPT1 knockoutmouse brain but comprise only 0.3% of the autofluorescent storage material by mass. The accumulation of LLOs is postulated to result from inhibition of late stages of lysosomal degradation of autophagosomes, which may be enriched in these metabolic precursors. 3aanimal models 3abrain 3afree air carbon dioxide enrichment 3agenes 3aknockout mutants 3amice 3aneurodegenerative diseases 3aneurons 3aoligosaccharides 3apatients 3atissues1 aGao, Ningguo1 aPearce, David A.1 aLehrman, Mark A.1 aHofmann, Sandra L.0 tGlycobiology.g2005 June, v. 15, no. 6 p.637-648x0959-66587nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/glycob/cwi0423Available from publisher's Web site  a20050529b20050604c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03196naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003100092040001800123100001800141245010800159300001600267520185300283650001202136650002802148650002202176650001802198650001402216650001802230650001802248650001102266650001202277650001802289650002102307650003002328700002202358700002402380700001602404700002102420700002002441700002002461700001802481700002302499773007002522852000902592856008102601930003302682946001102715655001202726IND4371503020221116175645.0050617e200507  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437150302DNAL7 a10.1093/glycob/cwi0512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShoji, Hiroki10aXenopus galectin-VIIa binds N-glycans of members of the cortical granule lectin family (xCGL and xCGL2)  ap. 709-720.  aWe have identified members of the Xenopus cortical granule lectin (xCGL) family as candidate target glycoproteins of Xenopus galectin-VIIa (xgalectin-VIIa) in Xenopus embryos. In addition to the original xCGL, we also identified a novel member of the xCGL family, xCGL2. Expression of the mRNAs of xCGL and xCGL2, as well as that of xgalectin-VIIa, was observed throughout early embryogenesis. Two and three potential N-glycosylation sites were deduced from the amino acid sequences of xCGL and xCGL2, respectively, and xgalectin-VIIa recognizes N-glycans linked to a common site in xCGL and xCGL2 and also recognizes N-glycans linked to a site specific to xCGL2. However, interaction between xgalectin-Ia and xCGLs was not detectable. We also obtained consistent results on surface plasmon resonance analysis involving xCGLs as ligands and xgalectins as analytes. The K[subscript d] value of the interaction between xgalectin-VIIa and xCGLs was calculated to be 35.9 nM. The structures of the N-glycans of xCGLs, which were recognized by xgalectin-VIIa, were analyzed by the two-dimensional sugar map method, and three kinds of N-acetyllactosamine type, biantennary N-glycans were identified as the major neutral N-glycans. The binding specificity of oligosaccharides for xgalectin-VIIa was analyzed by frontal affinity chromatography (FAC). The oligosaccharide specificity pattern of xgalectin-VIIa was similar to that of the human homolog galectin-3, and it was also shown that the N-acetyllactosamine type, biantennary N-glycans exhibit high affinity for xgalectin-VIIa (K[subscript d] = 11 [micro]M). These results suggest that xgalectin-VIIa interacts with xCGLs through binding to N-acetyllactosamine type N-glycans and that this interaction might make it possible to organize a lectin network involving members of different lectin families. 3aXenopus 3aaffinity chromatography 3acortical granules 3aembryogenesis 3agalectins 3aglycoproteins 3aglycosylation 3ahumans 3aligands 3amessenger RNA 3aoligosaccharides 3asurface plasmon resonance1 aIkenaka, Kazuhiro1 aNakakita, Shin-ichi1 aHayama, Koh1 aHirabayashi, Jun1 aArata, Yoichiro1 aKasai, Ken-ichi1 aNishi, Nozomu1 aNakamura, Takanori0 tGlycobiology.g2005 July, v. 15, no. 7 p.709-720x0959-66587nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/glycob/cwi0513Available from publisher's Web site  a20050617b00000000c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02608naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003100092040001800123100002000141245018700161300001600348520131400364650002001678650001301698650002301711650001101734650002501745650002601770650001101796650001201807650002201819650001301841650002101854650002401875650002601899700002101925700002301946773009501969852000902064856008102073930003302154946001102187655001202198IND4378695020221116175600.0060312e200604  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437869502DNAL7 a10.1093/glycob/cwj0682doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIhara, Hideyuki10aReaction mechanism and substrate specificity for nucleotide sugar of mammalian [alpha]1,6-fucosyltransferase--a large-scale preparation and characterization of recombinant human FUT8  ap. 333-342.  aFUT8, mammalian [alpha]1,6-fucosyltransferase, catalyzes the transfer of a fucose residue from the donor substrate, guanosine 5'-diphosphate (GDP)-{szligbeta}-L-fucose, to the reducing terminal GlcNAc of the core structure of asparagine-linked oligosaccharide via an [alpha]1,6-linkage. FUT8 is a typical type II membrane protein, which is localized in the Golgi apparatus. We have previously shown that two neighboring arginine residues that are conserved among [alpha]1,2-, [alpha]1,6-, and protein O-fucosyltransferases play an important role in donor substrate binding. However, details of the catalytic and reaction mechanisms and the ternary structure of FUT8 are not understood except for the substrate specificity of the acceptor. To develop a better understanding of FUT8, we established a large-scale production system for recombinant human FUT8, in which the enzyme is produced in soluble form by baculovirus-infected insect cells. Kinetic analyses and inhibition studies using derivatives of GDP-{szligbeta}-L-fucose revealed that FUT8 catalyzes the reaction which depends on a rapid equilibrium random mechanism and strongly recognizes the base portion and diphosphoryl group of GDP-{szligbeta}-L-fucose. These results may also be applicable to other fucosyltransferases and glycosyltransferases. 3aGolgi apparatus 3aarginine 3acatalytic activity 3afucose 3aglycosyltransferases 3aguanosine diphosphate 3ahumans 3ainsects 3amembrane proteins 3amoieties 3aoligosaccharides 3areaction mechanisms 3asubstrate specificity1 aIkeda, Yoshitaka1 aTaniguchi, Naoyuki0 tGlycobiology.g2006 Apr., v. 16, no. 4 p.333-342dOxford University Pressx0959-66587nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/glycob/cwj0683Available from publisher's Web site  a20060312b20060402c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03376naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003100092040001800123100001600141245018000157300001600337520178000353650001802133650001802151650002202169650002402191650002402215650002002239650003102259650001002290650001102300650001502311650001802326650001602344650002102360650003702381650002902418650002602447700001902473700002102492700002002513700002002533700001902553700002002572700001902592700001902611773009402630852000902724856008102733930003302814946001102847655001202858IND4379680920221116175616.0060416e200605  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437968092DNAL7 a10.1093/glycob/cwj0872doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKang, Young10aTranscriptional regulation of the human GD3 synthase gene expression in Fas-induced Jurkat T cells: a critical role of transcription factor NF-[kappa]B in regulated expression  ap. 375-389.  aThe transcriptional regulation mechanisms involved in the up-regulation of Fas-induced GD3 synthase gene have not yet been elucidated. 5'-Rapid amplification of cDNA end (5'-RACE) using mRNA prepared from Fas-induced Jurkat T cells revealed the presence of multiple transcription start sites of human GD3 synthase gene, and the 5'-end analysis of the longest of its product showed that transcription started from 650 nucleotides upstream of the translational initiation site. Promoter analyses of the 5'-flanking region of the human GD3 synthase gene using luciferase gene reporter system showed strong promoter activity in Fas-induced Jurkat T cells. Deletion study revealed that the region from -1146 to -646 (A of the translational start ATG as position +1) was indispensable for the Fas response. This region lacks apparent TATA and CAAT boxes but contains putative binding sites for transcription factors c-Ets-1, cAMP-responsive element-binding (CREB) protein, activating protein 1 (AP-1), and NF-[kappa]B. Base-substitution experiment showed that only the NF-[kappa]B-binding site of putative binding sites is required for the maximal expression induced by Fas. Both DNase I footprint and electrophoretic mobility shift assays with the nuclear extract of Fas-induced Jurkat T cells revealed that NF-[kappa]B was bound specifically to the probe being mediated by its binding site in the promoter sequence. Taken together, these results indicate that NF-[kappa]B plays an essential role in the transcriptional activity of human GD3 synthase gene in Fas-induced Jurkat T cells. In addition, the translocation of NF-[kappa]B-binding protein to nucleus by Fas activation is also crucial for the increased expression of the GD3 synthase gene in Fas-activated Jurkat T cells. 3aT-lymphocytes 3abinding sites 3acomplementary DNA 3adeoxyribonuclease I 3agel electrophoresis 3agene expression 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3ahumans 3aluciferase 3amessenger RNA 3anucleotides 3apromoter regions 3arapid amplification of cDNA ends 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranscription factors1 aKang, Sung-Koo1 aLee, Young-Choon1 aChoi, Hee-Jeong1 aLee, Young-Seek1 aCho, Soo-Young1 aKim, Y≈èng-sam.1 aKo, Jeong-Heon1 aKim, Cheorl-Ho0 tGlycobiology.g2006 May, v. 16, no. 5 p.375-389dOxford University Pressx0959-66587nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/glycob/cwj0873Available from publisher's Web site  a20060416b20060529c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03152naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003100092040001800123100002200141245012100163300001600284520167100300650001601971650001501987650001102002650001802013650001802031650001602049650001202065650001302077650002002090650003002110650002402140650001902164650001602183650004002199700002802239700002302267700002002290700002602310700002102336700002102357700002102378700002002399700002302419773007002442852000902512856008102521930003302602946001102635655001202646IND4377232520190613000000.0060115e200602  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437723252DNAL7 a10.1093/glycob/cwj0422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTabar√©s, Gl√≤ria10aDifferent glycan structures in prostate-specific antigen from prostate cancer sera in relation to seminal plasma PSA  ap. 132-145.  aProstate-specific antigen (PSA), the tumor marker currently used for prostate cancer (PCa), is not specific enough to distinguish between PCa and benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH). Glycan processing is normally perturbed in tumors, therefore we investigated whether changes in glycosylation of PSA could be useful diagnostic indicators. Previously we determined that the glycosylation of PSA secreted by the tumor prostate cell line LNCaP differs significantly from that of PSA from seminal plasma (normal control). We therefore undertook a detailed glycan analysis of PSA derived from sera from PCa patients and, importantly, established that the glycosylation of the PCa serum PSA was significantly different from the PSA from the LNCaP cell line. In comparison with seminal plasma PSA, the fucose content of PSA from the PCa patient serum was significantly lower and there was a decrease in a2,3-linked sialic acid. Differences in the glycosylation of PSA derived from PCa patients' sera, seminal plasma, and LNCaP cells were further established by lectin detection, glycosylation immunosorbent assay, and two-dimensional electrophoresis. We also investigated whether the impact of glycosylation changes initiated by the tumor was reflected in the serum glycome. By comparing the glycans released from the total glycoproteins in PCa patient serum with those of normal serum we found an increase in the proportion of sialyl-Lewis x structures. Further analysis of the glycosylation of PSA from PCa and BPH sera will be required in order to determine the utility of these glycan differences to discriminate specifically between benign and malignant prostate states. 3ablood serum 3acell lines 3afucose 3aglycoproteins 3aglycosylation 3ahyperplasia 3alectins 3apatients 3apolysaccharides 3aprostate-specific antigen 3aprostatic neoplasms 3aseminal plasma 3asialic acid 3atwo-dimensional gel electrophoresis1 aRadcliffe, Catherine M.1 aBarrab√©s, S√≠lvia1 aRam√≠rez, Manel1 aAleixandre, R.

Agricultural growth, poverty and the environment.  a2019-12-05  aThis paper examines several aspects of tariff rate quotas (TRQ) as adopted during tariffication of agricultural policies under the Uruguay Round of GATT. Quota rents and non-tariff barrier effects may remain under TRQs, contrary to the objectives of the tariffication process. Further, price stability impacts of a TRQ are more complex than those for either tariffs or quotas, and under certain circumstances TRQs may be more stabilizing than either case, since TRQs truncate domestic production distributions much like price bands policies. This complexity results from the possibility of regime switching, and may reflect behavior under either a tariff, a quota, or a combination of cases. A TRQ policy may affect the timing of import decisions based on incentives created under quota allocation procedures envisioned for this institution. It may also allow increased imports as demand growth occurs because the quota is not necessarily a binding constraint. This means the above quota tariff is the critical policy instrument. An empirical study of Philippines pork imports illustrates these issues. 3apork 3asimulation models 3aimports 3anontariff trade barriers 3aUruguay Round 3atrade negotiations 3aPhilippines 0ademand 0atrade agreements 0atarriffication 0aquotas 0aprice stabilization1 aPaarlberg, P.L.0 tAgricultural economics.g1998 Dec., v. 19, no. 3 p.257-267aAgricultural economics (Amsterdam, Netherlands)x0169-51507nnas  aDNAL  a19990702b19990709c00000000  aINDdTBT  aNon-US 7aarticle02306naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001500110245009600125300001600221500015600237500001500393520095400408650000901362650002401371650002401395650000801419650001401427650001601441650002301457650002301480650002001503650001401523651001101537653002101548653002701569653002001596653002201616653001201638700001501650773012901665852000901794930003301803945001301836946001101849655001201860IND2198869220221121224246.0990524e199812  ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND219886922DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDimara, E.10aAdoption of new tobacco varieties in Greece: impacts of empirical findings on policy design  ap. 297-307.  aSelected papers from the 23rd Conference of the International Association of Agricultural Economists. Agricultural growth, poverty and the environment.  a2019-12-05  aGreece is a major international tobacco producer. Flue-cured tobacco varieties constituted the major alternative crop to Greek farmers growing certain oriental tobacco varieties. Diffusion of flue-cured tobacco was rapid due to its high yields and the depressed market for certain oriental tobacco varieties. Currently, the common organisation of the tobacco market is undergoing substantial changes, and the farmers' response will be a vital factor of success. A portfolio selection model reveals that the major factors influencing the adoption decision of tobacco growers are the size of the farm measured in annual work units, the farm's proximity to urban centres, the farm's diversification and the farmer's age. The number of contacts with institutions is, surprisingly, inversely related to adoption. Future tobacco policies impinging on factors influencing decisions to adopt new varieties or production practices may be more cost-effective. 3arisk 3amathematical models 3ainnovation adoption 3aage 3avarieties 3afarm income 3afarmers' attitudes 3aflue-cured tobacco 3adecision making 3afarm size 3aGreece 0aprofit functions 0alocation of production 0adiversification 0asun-cured tobacco 0atobacco1 aSkuras, D.0 tAgricultural economics.g1998 Dec., v. 19, no. 3 p.297-307aAgricultural economics (Amsterdam, Netherlands)x0169-51507nnas  aDNAL  a19990702b19990709c00000000  aINDdTBT  aNon-US 7aarticle03243naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100001800184245008800202300002000290506007600310520166700386506003702053650002702090650001102117650002002128650001702148650001702165650002102182650001502203650001702218650002502235650001602260650001302276700002102289700002102310700002002331700002202351700002002373700002102393700002102414773017602435852000902611856008302620930003302703946001302736655001202749IND4428986520221207134714.0091120e20091117xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442898652DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.09104841062doi7 aPMC27737332pmcid7 a198927342pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShin, Yongdae10aSingle-molecule denaturation and degradation of proteins by the AAA+ ClpXP protease  ap. 19340-19345.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aClpXP is an ATP-fueled molecular machine that unfolds and degrades target proteins. ClpX, an AAA+ enzyme, recognizes specific proteins, and then uses cycles of ATP hydrolysis to denature any native structure and to translocate the unfolded polypeptide into ClpP for degradation. Here, we develop and apply single-molecule fluorescence assays to probe the kinetics of protein denaturation and degradation by ClpXP. These assays employ a single-chain variant of the ClpX hexamer, linked via a single biotin to a streptavidin-coated surface, and fusion substrates with an N-terminal fluorophore and a C-terminal GFP-titin-ssrA module. In the presence of adenosine 5'-[Œ≥-thio]triphosphate (ATPŒ≥S), ClpXP degrades the titin-ssrA portion of these substrates but stalls when it encounters GFP. Exchange into ATP then allows synchronous resumption of denaturation and degradation of GFP and any downstream domains. GFP unfolding can be monitored directly, because intrinsic fluorescence is quenched by denaturation. The time required for complete degradation coincides with loss of the substrate fluorophore from the protease complex. Fitting single-molecule data for a set of related substrates provides time constants for ClpX unfolding, translocation, and a terminal step that may involve product release. Comparison of these single-molecule results with kinetics measured in bulk solution indicates similar levels of microscopic and macroscopic ClpXP activity. These results support a stochastic engagement/unfolding mechanism that ultimately results in highly processive degradation and set the stage for more detailed single-molecule studies of machine function.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aadenosine triphosphate 3abiotin 3adata collection 3adenaturation 3afluorescence 3afluorescent dyes 3ahydrolysis 3apolypeptides 3aprotein denaturation 3aproteinases 3aproteins1 aDavis, Joseph H.1 aBrau, Ricardo R.1 aMartin, Andreas1 aKenniston, Jon A.1 aBaker, Tania A.1 aSauer, Robert T.1 aLang, Matthew J.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2009 Nov. 17, v. 106, no. 46 p.19340-19345dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.09104841063Available from publisher's Web site  a20091120b20091204c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02888naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245010200126300001600228500034300244500001500587520118900602650002401791650001101815650002001826650001701846650002501863650002501888650002301913650001401936650001001950650002101960651001701981653002401998653001102022653005602033653001702089653002702106653001602133653002302149700002002172700001602192773013202208852000902340930003302349945001302382946001102395655001202406IND2197944420221121141918.0990402e199809  ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND219794442DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aThirtle, C.10aTesting the induced innovation hypothesis: an error correction model of South African agriculture  ap. 145-157.  aIn the special issue: Agricultural growth, poverty and the environment.

Food security, diversification, and resource management: refocusing the role of agriculture? / edited by P. Hazell.  a2019-12-05  aThis paper applies cointegration techniques to a model of induced innovation based on the two-stage constant elasticity of substitution (CES) production function. This approach results in direct tests of the inducement hypothesis, which are applied to data for South African commercial agriculture for the period 1947-1991. South African data is used because the policy changes have been substantial enough that the factor and price ratios have turning-points, rather than being monotonic. The time series properties of the variables are checked, cointegration is established, and an error correction model (ECM) constructed, allowing factor substitution to be separated from technological change. Finally, the ECM formulation is subjected to causality tests, which show that both the factor price ratios and R&D and extension expenditures are Granger-prior to the factor-saving biases of technological change. Thus, each stage of the analysis corroborates the inducement hypothesis. However, straightforward price-inducement is only part of the explanation of changes in factor ratios. Policy-induced innovation, in response to tax concessions and subsidised credit, is also present. 3aagricultural credit 3aprices 3aeconomic theory 3aelasticities 3atime series analysis 3aproduction functions 3aeconometric models 3asubsidies 3ataxes 3acommercial farms 3aSouth Africa 0ainduced innovations 0aratios 0atwo-stage constant elasticity of substitution model 0asubstitution 0acommercial agriculture 0afarm credit 0atechnical progress1 aTownsend, R.

In addition to measures to reduce the input of atmospheric deposition, removal of the ectorganic layers by sod-cutting may contribute to the recovery of the soil ecosystem. In this study, we examined the effects of sod-cutting on the nematode fauna of a Scots pine forest, 1 and 3 years after treatment. Sod-cutting reduced the total numbers of nematodes, nematode taxa, and Maturity Index. The first taxa that colonized the newly developing organic layers after sod-cutting had low colonizer-persister (c-p) values, and appeared to have originated from the tree canopy and mineral soil. Colonization, presumably from nearby untreated plots, was observed 3 years after the sod-cutting. The initial (after 1 year) nematode community of the new organic layer comprised hyphal-, bacterial-, and algal-feeding nematodes, whereas plant-feeders, predators, and omnivores were not detected. The composition of the S nematode fauna in the ectorganic layers 15 and 39 months after sod-cutting was highly similar to that of the nematode fauna of the early stages of a primary succession of Scots pine forest in a reference area in the Netherlands. In the mineral soil only insect parasites were negatively affected by sod-cutting. 3atemporal variation 3asoil fauna 3asoil pollution 3apollutants 3aforest management 3aforest soils 3aPinus sylvestris 3acommunity ecology 3apopulation 3afree-living nematodes 3aair pollution 3adisturbed soils 3atrophic relationships 3aNetherlands 0asurface layers 0acolonization 0arecovery 0adeposition 0aremoval 0aectorganic horizons 0acommunity composition0 tBiology and fertility of soils.g1996, v. 22, no. 3 p.227-236x0178-27627nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF003825173Available from publisher's Web site  a19970106b19970110c00000000  aINDdCMS  aNon-US 7aarticle03135naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001600129245017300145300001500318500002400333520141700357650001401774650001801788650001601806650001701822650002101839650001101860650001401871650003201885650002401917650001301941650001401954650001001968650001501978650001101993650002502004650001002029650003602039650004002075650005102115650002402166650003602190650002902226650004802255650001102303650003802314650003302352650001302385650000902398650002902407700001602436700001502452773008102467852000902548655001202557IND4372874020221121141836.0050730e200402  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437287402DNAL7 a150367882pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCecil, J.E.10aInvestigation into the role of cephalic stimulation of acid secretion on gastric emptying and appetite following a soup meal using the gastric acid inhibitor omeprazole  ap. 99-105.  aIncludes references  aWe previously showed that oral administration of a liquid soup preload was associated with a slower rate of gastric emptying and suppressed appetite more compared with intragastric administration of the same soup Appetite 31(1998)377. The present study was designed to investigate whether these results could be explained by the cephalic stimulation of acid secretion induced by oral administration. Eight healthy male subjects took part in a double-blind placebo controlled study comparing the effects of omeprazole and placebo on gastric emptying, appetite ratings and subsequent food intake following the ingestion of a liquid soup. Subjects were administered with a single oral dose of 80 mg omeprazole or placebo 3 h prior to ingesting the radiolabelled soup preload (400 kcal; 425 ml) over 15 min. Ratings of hunger, desire to eat and fullness were recorded over 135 min and gastric emptying was measured by scintigraphy. Food intake was evaluated from a test meal (yoghurt drink) given 120 min after the end of the soup ingestion. Analysis of data showed that there was no significant difference between omeprazole and placebo in gastric emptying, appetite or subsequent energy intake from the test meal. The results suggest that gastric acid secretion is not responsible for the differences in gastric emptying and appetite observed between intragastrically infused and orally administered soup preloads. 3abeverages 3aenergy intake 3afood intake 3agastric acid 3agastric emptying 3ahunger 3aingestion 3aintragastric administration 3aoral administration 3aplacebos 3asecretion 3asoups 3atest meals 3ayogurt 2aAdministration, Oral 2aAdult 2aAnti-Ulcer Agentsxpharmacology 2aAppetitexdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aAppetite Regulationxdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aDouble-Blind Method 2aEnzyme Inhibitorsxpharmacology 2aGastric Acidxsecretion. 2aGastric Emptyingxdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aHumans 2aHungerxdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aIntubation, Gastrointestinal 2aKinetics 2aMale 2aOmeprazolexpharmacology1 aFrancis, J.1 aRead, N.W.0 tAppetite.g2004 Feb., v. 42, no. 1 p.99-105dAcademic Pressx0195-66637nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle03323naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002800092040001800120100002600138245012900164300001600293520186900309650002302178650002002201650001702221650001302238650001902251650002202270650002102292650002602313650002602339650001202365650002002377650001302397650001702410650002602427651001002453653002402463653001702487653001502504700001802519700001702537700001802554700001802572773008302590852000902673856007802682930003302760945001302793946001102806655001202817IND2054472820221121105226.0961213s1996    wb |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205447282DNAL7 a10.1007/BF003825212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGonzalez-Prieto, S.J.10aEffect of soil characteristics on N mineralization capacity in 112 native and agricultural soils from the northwest of Spain  ap. 252-260.  aN mineralization capacity and its main controlling factors were studied in a large variety (n=112) of native (forest, bush) and agricultural (pasture, cultivated) soils from several climatic zones in Spain. The available inorganic N content, net N mineralization, and net N mineralization rate were determined after 6 weeks of aerobic incubation. NH4+-N largely predominated over NO3(-)-N (ratio near 10:1) except in some agricultural soils. Net N mineralization predominated (83% of soils) over net N immobilization, which was more frequent in agricultural soils (25%) than in native soils (9%). In forest soils, both net N mineralization and the net N mineralization rate were significantly higher than in the other soil groups. The net N mineralization rate of pasture and cultivated soils was similar to that of bush soils, but available inorganic N was lower. The net N mineralization rate decreased in the order: soils over acid rocks>soils over sediments>soils over basic rocks or limestone; moreover, the highest net N mineralization and available inorganic N were found in soils over acid rocks. The highest N mineralization was found in soils with low C and N contents, particularly in the native soils, in which N mineralization increased as the C:N ratio increased. N mineralization was higher in soils with a low pH and base saturation than in soils with high pH and base saturation values, which sometimes favoured N immobilization. Soils with an Al gel content of >1% showed lower net N mineralization rates than soils with Al gel contents of <1%, although net N mineralization and available inorganic N did not differ between these groups. The net N mineralization rate in silty soils was significantly lower than in sandy and clayey soils, although soil texture only explained a low proportion of the differences in N mineralization between soils. 3aagricultural soils 3agrassland soils 3aforest soils 3anitrogen 3amineralization 3aammonium nitrogen 3anitrate nitrogen 3anutrient availability 3acarbon nitrogen ratio 3asoil pH 3abase saturation 3aaluminum 3asoil texture 3asoil parent materials 3aSpain 0auncultivated ground 0anative soils 0abush soils1 aCabaneiro, A.1 aVillar, M.C.1 aCarballas, M.1 aCarballas, T.0 tBiology and fertility of soils.g1996, v. 22, no. 3 p.252-260x0178-27627nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF003825213Available from publisher's Web site  a19970106b19970110c00000000  aINDdCMS  aNon-US 7aarticle02697naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001400110245007000124300001400194500034300208520144000551650001001991650002002001650001902021650002202040650001102062650001102073651000902084653002302093653001702116700001802133773013002151852000902281930003302290945001302323946001102336655001202347IND2197943520221121141902.0990402e199809  ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND219794352DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLilja, N.10aWelfare impacts of technological change on women in southern Mali  ap. 73-79.  aIn the special issue: Agricultural growth, poverty and the environment. Paper presented at the twenty-third International Conference of the International Agricultural Economists, August 10-16, 1997, Sacramento, California. Food security, diversification, and resource management: refocusing the role of agriculture? / edited by P. Hazell.  aIt has often been hypothesized that new agricultural technologies could have an adverse impact on women because additional labor required of them reduces the time spent and therefore income earned from private-field activities. This study shows that the expansion of cotton cultivation on the household communal fields in southern Mali associated with the introduction of new technologies results in increased payments to women for their increased labor on the cotton fields. Unfortunately, these payments are small compared to the loss of revenue from private-plot production. Thus, the net effect of the expansion of household cotton cultivation is a reduction in incomes of women who cultivate private plots. Short-run policy implications of this study are that improving women's income requires concern with their private-plot earnings. For example, profitability of the private-field crops could be increased with higher input use. In the long run, as land becomes even more constrained, emphasis needs to be placed on institutional changes to increase women's bargaining power so that they obtain larger shares of the new income streams resulting from technological change on the communal field. Institutional changes already occurring in the region, with the apparent objective of increasing women's (and non-household head men's) bargaining power, include organized work teams and the movement toward smaller, nuclear families. 3awomen 3aeconomic impact 3aland ownership 3awelfare economics 3acotton 3aincome 3aMali 0atechnical progress 0afemale labor1 aSanders, J.H.0 tAgricultural economics.g1998 Sept., v. 19, no. 1/2 p.73-79aAgricultural economics (Amsterdam, Netherlands)x0169-51507nnas  aDNAL  a19990531b19990608c00000000  aINDdTBT  aNon-US 7aarticle03509naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153072000900171072000900180100002200189245007700211300001600288500002400304500001500328520168800343650000902031650003102040650001202071650001402083650001702097650001102114650001702125650001202142650003302154650002602187650000902213650001102222650000902233650004402242650002602286650007402312650004702386653002302433653002302456653002502479653002902504653004002533653001902573700001902592700002202611773010202633852000902735856009202744930003302836945002502869946001302894655001202907IND4421372020221121105253.0090605e200906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442137202DNAL7 a195386642pmid7 a10.1111/j.1532-950X.2009.00547.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL840 0aL8001 aHARDIE, ROBERT J.10aArytenoid Lateralization for Treatment of Laryngeal Paralysis in 10 Cats  ap. 445-451.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aTo describe the signalment, history, clinical signs, surgical technique, and outcome for cats with laryngeal paralysis that had arytenoid lateralization. Case series. Cats with laryngeal paralysis (n=10). Medical records (1996-2002) for cats with laryngeal paralysis that had arytenoid lateralization were reviewed for signalment, history, clinical signs, degree of paralysis, cause, concurrent medical conditions, surgical technique, and outcome. Follow-up information was obtained from owners or referring veterinarians. Of 10 cats, 9 had bilateral and 1 had unilateral laryngeal paralysis. Arytenoid lateralization were unilateral (n=7), bilateral (1), and staged bilateral procedures (2), 10 days and 3 years apart, respectively. Postoperatively, 1 cat had persistent inspiratory noise because of minimal enlargement of the rima glottidis and 2 cats required a temporary tracheostomy for management of laryngeal swelling. Three cats developed aspiration pneumonia and died 4, 7, and 150 days after surgery; all 3 had bilateral (simultaneous or staged) procedures. Of the 7 remaining cats, 4 were alive at follow-up and 3 had died of causes unrelated to arytenoid lateralization. The calculated mean survival time for all 10 cats was 406 days (median, 150 days; range, 4-1825 days). Arytenoid lateralization was effective at enlarging the rima glottidis and reducing signs of airway obstruction in most cats. Unilateral arytenoid lateralization is a feasible option for the surgical management of cats with marked clinical signs; however, bilateral procedures should be avoided or at least performed with considerable caution because of the apparent risk for aspiration pneumonia. 3acats 3arespiratory tract diseases 3asurgery 3aparalysis 3acat diseases 3alarynx 3acase studies 2aAnimals 2aArytenoid Cartilagexsurgery 2aCat Diseasesxsurgery 2aCats 2aFemale 2aMale 2aPostoperative Complicationsxveterinary 2aRetrospective Studies 2aSurgical Procedures, Operativexadverse effectsxmethodsxveterinary. 2aVocal Cord Paralysisxsurgeryxveterinary. 0aairway obstruction 0arespiratory system 0aaspiration pneumonia 0aarytenoid lateralization 0aunilateral arytenoid lateralization 0arima glottidis1 aGUNBY, JESSICA1 aBJORLING, DALE E.0 tVeterinary surgery.g2009 June, v. 38, no. 4 p.445-451dBlackwell Publishing Incx0161-34997nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1532-950X.2009.00547.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20090730b20090801c00000000  aINDd6CTe2009/07/07  aOther US 7aarticle03035naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166072001700184072001700201100002100218245008900239300002000328500001500348506007600363520130800439506003701747650001601784650002701800650002601827650001901853650001801872650002601890650001101916650001101927650003201938650001901970650001501989650001102004650001302015651000902028653002602037700002502063700001902088700001402107700002102121773017602142852000902318856008302327930003302410945002502443946001302468655001202481IND4428987620221207132946.0091120e20091117xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442898762DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.09064481062doi7 aPMC27807702pmcid7 a198845052pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

One consequence, previously unexplored, is that as Na supplies decrease (e.g., from coastal to inland forests), ecosystem carbon should accumulate as detritus. Here, we show that adding NaCl solution to the leaf litter of an inland Amazon forest enhanced mass loss by 41%, decreased lignin concentrations by 7%, and enhanced decomposition of pure cellulose by up to 50%, compared with stream water alone. These effects emerged after 13-18 days. Termites, a common decomposer, increased 7-fold on +NaCl plots, suggesting an agent for the litter loss. Ants, a common predator, increased 2-fold, suggesting that NaCl effects cascade upward through the food web. Sodium, not chloride, was likely the driver of these patterns for two reasons: two compounds of Na (NaCl and NaPO‚ÇÑ) resulted in equivalent cellulose loss, and ants in choice experiments underused Cl (as KCl, MgCl‚ÇÇ, and CaCl‚ÇÇ) relative to NaCl and three other Na compounds (NaNO‚ÇÉ, Na‚ÇÉPO‚ÇÑ, and Na‚ÇÇSO‚ÇÑ). We provide experimental evidence that Na shortage slows the carbon cycle. Because 80% of global landmass lies >100 km inland, carbon stocks and consumer activity may frequently be regulated via Na limitation.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3atree growth 3achemical concentration 3atropical rain forests 3amineralization 3aforest litter 3anutrient availability 3acarbon 3asodium 3abiological activity in soil 3abiodegradation 3aFormicidae 3alignin 3aIsoptera 3aPeru 0abiogeochemical cycles1 aYanoviak, Stephen P.1 aDudley, Robert1 aYuan, May1 aClay, Natalie A.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2009 Nov. 17, v. 106, no. 46 p.19405-19409dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.09064481063Available from publisher's Web site  a20091208b20100101c00000000  aINDdRHFe2009/12/08  aOther US 7aarticle02627naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100002000184245008800204300002000292506007600312520117300388506003701561650001601598650001201614650002001626650002101646650001001667650002301677650001701700650001301717650002201730650001701752650002701769700001701796700002301813700003101836773017601867852000902043856008302052930003302135946001302168655001202181IND4428987920221207132945.0091120e20091117xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442898792DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.09099371062doi7 aPMC27807742pmcid7 a198807412pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEspa√±ol, Yaiza12aA mechanism for functional segregation of mitochondrial and cytosolic genetic codes  ap. 19420-19425.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe coexistence of multiple gene translation machineries is a feature of eukaryotic cells and a result of the endosymbiotic events that gave rise to mitochondria, plastids, and other organelles. The conditions required for the integration of these apparatuses within a single cell are not understood, but current evidence indicates that complete ablation of the mitochondrial protein synthesis apparatus and its substitution by its cytosolic equivalent is not possible. Why certain mitochondrial components and not others can be substituted by cytosolic equivalents is not known. In trypanosomatids this situation reaches a limit, because certain aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases are mitochondrial specific despite the fact that all tRNAs in these organisms are shared between cytosol and mitochondria. Here we report that a mitochondria-specific lysyl-tRNA synthetase in Trypanosoma has evolved a mechanism to block the activity of the enzyme during its synthesis and translocation. Only when the enzyme reaches the mitochondria is it activated through the cleavage of a C-terminal structural extension, preventing the possibility of the enzyme being active in the cytosol.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aTrypanosoma 3acytosol 3aenzyme activity 3aeukaryotic cells 3agenes 3alysine-tRNA ligase 3amitochondria 3aplastids 3aprotein synthesis 3atransfer RNA 3atranslation (genetics)1 aThut, Daniel1 aSchneider, Andr√©.1 aRibas de Pouplana, Llu√≠s.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2009 Nov. 17, v. 106, no. 46 p.19420-19425dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.09099371063Available from publisher's Web site  a20091120b20091204c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02252naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001300128245005900141300002000200520098100220650002801201650001801229650001601247650002801263650001201291650001801303650001601321650002801337650003001365650004101395650003101436650005301467650004701520650004001567653001301607700001601620700001601636773009801652852000901750930003301759945001301792946001301805655001201818IND2047126120221121035333.0950804e19940902mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204712612DNAL7 a80713402pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGood, L.10aTetrahymena ribozyme disrupts rRNA processing in yeast  ap. 22169-22172.  aThe intervening sequence (IVS) of Tetrahymena thermophila nucleolar DNA interrupts a highly conserved sequence in the RNA core structure of the large ribosomal subunit. This location in nuclear DNA is unusual as most group I introns are in mitochondrial and chloroplast DNA. To examine the effect of a ribozyme insertion in another nuclear genome, the Tetrahymena IVS was introduced into the analogous position in a cloned Schizosaccharomyces pombe ribosomal gene, and the mutant rDNA was expressed in vivo. RNA analyses indicated that mature 5.8 S rRNA was not formed from the mutant gene transcript and the amount of 27 S nRNA was significantly reduced. In contrast, hybridization analyses indicated that RNA splicing continued, and normal forms of free ribozyme were present. The results show that the IVS sequence can interfere with rRNA processing and suggest that the unusual amplification of a single rDNA repeat may have forced Tetrahymena to accommodate its ribozyme. 3aTetrahymena thermophila 3aribosomal RNA 3atransposons 3ainsertional mutagenesis 2aAnimals 2aBase Sequence 2aDNA Primers 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aNucleic Acid Conformation 2aRNA Processing, Post-Transcriptional 2aRNA, Catalyticxmetabolism 2aRNA, Ribosomalxchemistryxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aSchizosaccharomycesxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aTetrahymena thermophilaxenzymology 0asplicing1 aElela, S.A.1 aNazar, R.N.0 tJournal of biological chemistry.g1994 Sept. 2, v. 269, no. 35 p.22169-22172x0021-92587nnas  aDNAL  a19950905b19950912c00000000  aINDdLDP  aOther US 7aarticle01968naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092040001800125100001700143245011900160300001600279520099100295650002201286650002001308650001201328650002301340700001701363700001701380700001501397700001401412773008001426852000901506856008301515939003301598946001101631655001201642IND4461972120221121023326.0111007s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446197212DNAL7 a10.3415/VCOT-10-09-01362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKulendra, E.10aEvaluation of the transarticular external skeletal fixator for the treatment of tarsocrural instability in 32 cats  ap. 320-325.  aThe medical records of all cats with tarsocrural joint instability that were treated between June 2002 and December 2008 at the Royal Veterinary College were retrospectively reviewed. A total of 32 cats were identified. Information gathered included signalment, type of injury (subluxation or luxation), concurrent fractures, presence of soft tissue wounds, transarticular external skeletal fixation (TESF) type, configuration of TESF (number of pins proximal and distal to the joint), duration of hospitalisation, duration of TESF prior to removal, complications and cost. A significant association was identified between the length of hospitalisation and the presence of wounds. Similarly a significant association was present between wounds and final cost of treatment. Additionally, the authors found that a high number of implant related complications were present when only two pins were used proximal and distal to the tarsocrural joint, but this association was not significant. 3afracture fixation 3ajoints (animal) 3atissues 3aveterinary schools1 aGrierson, J.1 aOkushima, S.1 aCariou, M.1 aHouse, A.0 pVet. comp. orthop. traumatolg2011, v. 24, no. 5 p.320-325x0932-08147nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3415/VCOT-10-09-01363Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b00000000c20111007  aNon-US 7aarticle02067naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131100002000149245005300169300001600222500002400238520093300262650002301195650001001218650001201228650001201240650001801252650002001270650001301290650002301303650002001326650001401346650002101360650001201381650001301393700002001406700001701426700002601443773009001469852000901559856008901568655001201657IND4463968020221121023352.0120824s2003    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446396802DNAL7 a10.1016/S0308-8146(02)00258-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKuto≈°, Tatjana10aDietary fibre content of dry and processed beans  ap. 231-235.  aIncludes references  aCommon beans (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) are a good source of protein, vitamins, minerals and especially dietary fibre. As beans are never eaten raw, the effects of soaking, cooking, soaking-cooking and canning on soluble, insoluble and total dietary fibre contents of beans are studied. Total dietary fibre content was determined by enzyme-gravimetric method. The fraction of insoluble dietary fibre was corrected for the content of resistant starch, determined as part of the total starch in insoluble fibre. The results indicate that thermal processing decreased the insoluble fibre content, and consequently the total dietary fibre content of beans. Soaking and cooking of beans significantly (P<0.05) increased the resistant starch content. The data on dietary fibre content of processed food are much more relevant than those of raw food. Thus food composition tables should contain as much data on processed food as possible. 3aPhaseolus vulgaris 3abeans 3acanning 3acooking 3adietary fiber 3ainsoluble fiber 3aminerals 3anutrient databanks 3aprocessed foods 3araw foods 3aresistant starch 3asoaking 3avitamins1 aGolob, Terezija1 aKaƒç, Milica1 aPlestenjak, Anamarija0 tFood chemistry.g2003 Feb., v. 80, no. 2 p.231-235dElsevier Sciencex0308-81467nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0308-8146(02)00258-33Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03256naa a2200637 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001900128245007600147300002000223520137900243650001601622650001601638650001901654650002201673650002501695650002501720650003201745650002401777650002301801650003301824650003101857650002501888650001701913650002801930650005601958650002402014650002302038650003402061650003502095650002902130650002702159653002802186653001902214653001902233653001902252653001902271653001602290653001602306653001602322653001602338700001902354700001502373700001602388700001802404700001802422773009802440852000902538930003302547945001302580946001302593655001202606IND2048027920221121004303.0950929e19941014mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204802792DNAL7 a79292162pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBiermann, B.J.10aNovel isoprenylated proteins identified by an expression library screen  ap. 25251-25254.  aIsoprenylated proteins are involved in eukaryotic cell growth and signal transduction. The protein determinant for prenylation is a short carboxyl-terminal motif containing a cysteine, to which the isoprenoid is covalently attached via thioether linkage. To date, isoprenylated proteins have almost all been identified by demonstrating the attachment of an isoprenoid to previously known proteins. Thus, many isoprenylated proteins probably remain undiscovered. To identify novel isoprenylated proteins for subsequent biochemical study, colony blots of a Glycine max cDNA expression library were [3H]farnesyl-labeled in vitro. Proteins identified by this screen contained several different carboxyl termini that conform to consensus farnesylation motifs. These proteins included known farnesylated proteins (DnaJ homologs) and several novel proteins, two of which contained six or more tandem repeats of a hexapeptide having the consensus sequence (E/G)(G/P)EK(P/K)K. Thus, plants contain a diverse array of genes encoding farnesylated proteins, and our results indicate that fundamental differences in the identities of farnesylated proteins may exist between plants and other eukaryotes. Expression library screening by direct labeling can be adapted to identify isoprenylated proteins from other organisms, as well as proteins with other post-translational modifications. 3aGlycine max 3aisoprenoids 3aplant proteins 3acomplementary DNA 3anucleotide sequences 3aamino acid sequences 2aAlkyl and Aryl Transferases 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aConsensus Sequence 2aDNA, Complementaryxgenetics 2aEscherichia colixgenetics 2aFarnesolxmetabolism 2aGene Library 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPlant Proteinsxgeneticsxisolation & purification. 2aProtein Prenylation 2aSelection, Genetic 2aSequence Homology, Amino Acid 2aSoybeansxchemistryxgenetics. 2aTransferasesxmetabolism 2aras Proteinsxgenetics 0amolecular sequence data 0agenbank/u13179 0agenbank/u13180 0agenbank/u13181 0agenbank/u13182 0aembl/u13179 0aembl/u13180 0aembl/u13181 0aembl/u131821 aMorehead, T.A.1 aTate, S.E.1 aPrice, J.R.1 aRandall, S.K.1 aCrowell, D.N.0 tJournal of biological chemistry.g1994 Oct. 14, v. 269, no. 41 p.25251-25254x0021-92587nnas  aDNAL  a19951102b19951108c00000000  aINDdLDP  aOther US 7aarticle03500naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092040001800125100001700143245007700160300001600237520243900253650001602692650003002708650002402738650001402762650001902776650001602795650002602811650001702837650001102854700001502865700001502880700001502895773008002910852000902990856008302999939003303082946001103115655001203126IND4461972420221121004221.0111007s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446197242DNAL7 a10.3415/VCOT-10-07-01092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGatineau, M.10aRetrospective study of 476 tibial plateau levelling osteotomy procedures  ap. 333-341.  aObjective: To determine the rate of subsequent ‚Äòpivot shift‚Äô, meniscal tear and risk factors associated with complications of tibial plateau levelling osteotomy (TPLO) and to assess clinical and owner perception outcome. Study design: Retrospective study. Sample population: Three hundred and forty-eight dogs that had undergone TPLO surgical procedures (n = 476 stifles). Methods: Medical records were reviewed for the retrieval of information on breed, sex, age, body weight, clinical history, radiograph findings, pre- and postoperative tibial plateau angle, limb alignment, unilateral versus bilateral disease, condition of cranial cruciate ligament (CCL) and menisci, implant material, healing time and complications. Clinical and owner-assessed questionnaire outcomes were also recorded. Results: Forty-six (9.7%) postoperative complications were reported. Twenty (4.2%) were classified as major complications requiring an additional surgical intervention, and 26 (5.5%) as minor complications. No risk factors associated with postoperative complications were identified. Ten (2.1%) subsequent meniscal injuries in the stifles with normal un- altered menisci at time of TPLO were reported with a median postoperative time of 9.5 months. Signs of postoperative ‚Äòpivot shift‚Äô were reported in 15 (3.1%) stifles. All stifles with a ‚Äòpivot shift‚Äô had a complete CCL rupture or a debrided partial CCL rupture; a medial menisectomy was identified as a risk factor for a ‚Äòpivot shift‚Äô (p = 0.02). Dogs with intact medial meniscus had a significantly higher activity level (p <0.0001) and a shorter time to peak function (p = 0.02) than dogs that underwent menisectomy according to an owner questionnaire. Conclusions: Dogs with TPLO and intact meniscus seemed to have a better and faster recovery than dogs with TPLO and menisectomy based on owner questionnaires. ‚ÄòPivot shift‚Äô was infrequent after TPLO surgery. All dogs with a ‚Äòpivot shift‚Äô had a complete CCL rupture or a debrided partial CCL rupture and menisectomy was identified as a risk factor for its occurrence. Clinical relevance: Considering the relatively low rate of subsequent meniscal injury after TPLO, systematic medial meniscal release with TPLO may be unnecessary. The ‚Äòpivot shift‚Äô deserved further investigation to completely understand its mechanism, to identify its anatomic components and potential consequences on the stifle joint. 3abody weight 3acranial cruciate ligament 3aexperimental design 3aosteotomy 3aquestionnaires 3aradiography 3aretrospective studies 3arisk factors 3astifle1 aDupuis, J.1 aPlante, J.1 aMoreau, M.0 pVet. comp. orthop. traumatolg2011, v. 24, no. 5 p.333-341x0932-08147nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3415/VCOT-10-07-01093Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b00000000c20111007  aNon-US 7aarticle03079naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004100092040001800133100001800151245010200169300001800271500002400289500001500313520175600328650001202084650002302096650001102119650004302130650001702173650001002190650002202200650000802222650002302230650001102253650001702264651001002281653001502291700001902306700001502325700001702340700001702357700001902374700001402393773011402407852000902521856009102530655001202621IND4439021120221120233533.0100625s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443902112DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2010.05.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aL√º, Huixiong10aSeasonal and diurnal variations of carbonyl compounds in the urban atmosphere of Guangzhou, China  ap. 3523-3529.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aSeasonal and diurnal variations of carbonyl compounds were investigated at two sampling sites (Liwan and Wushan) in the ambient air of Guangzhou, China. Air samples were collected during 2005 from January to November, and carbonyl compounds were analyzed with HPLC. The results show that carbonyls exhibit distinct seasonal variation. The total concentrations of 21 carbonyls detected ranged from 2.64 to 103.6Œºgm‚Åª ¬≥ at Liwan and from 5.46 to 89.9Œºgm‚Åª ¬≥ at Wushan, respectively. The average total concentrations of carbonyls at both Liwan and Wushan decreased in order of summer>spring>autumn>winter. Formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, and acetone were the most abundant carbonyl compounds, which accounted for more than 60% of the total concentrations of carbonyls. The mean concentration ratios of summer/winter were all >1.0 for the total concentrations and the individual carbonyl compound. The diurnal variation of carbonyls was not distinct in this study. The average concentration ratios of formaldehyde/acetaldehyde (C‚ÇÅ/C‚ÇÇ) varied from 0.71 to 1.32 and 0.65 to 1.14 at Liwan and Wushan, respectively, and the average concentration ratios of acetaldehyde/propionaldehyde (C‚ÇÇ/C‚ÇÉ) varied from 5.42 to 7.70 and 5.02 to 13.9 in Liwan and Wushan, respectively. Regarding photochemical reactivity of carbonyls and the ozone production, acetaldehyde, butyraldehyde, formaldehyde, and valeraldehyde account for 75-90% to the total propene-equivalent concentrations, while formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, valeraldehyde, butyraldehyde, and propionaldehyde contribute 89-96% to the total ozone formation potentials (ranging from 105 to 274Œºgm‚Åª ¬≥). The ozone formation potentials in summer were higher by 1-2 times than those in the other seasons. 3aacetone 3acarbonyl compounds 3awinter 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3aacetaldehyde 3aozone 3adiurnal variation 3aair 3aseasonal variation 3asummer 3aformaldehyde 3aChina 0aatmosphere1 aCai, Quan-Ying1 aWen, Sheng1 aChi, Yuguang1 aGuo, Songjun1 aSheng, Guoying1 aFu, Jiamo0 tScience of the total environment.g2010 Aug. 1, v. 408, no. 17 p.3523-3529dElsevier Sciencex0048-96977nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2010.05.0133Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03305naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100001600184245008300200300002000283506007600303520162500379506003702004650001302041650001002054650001902064650001702083650001902100650001102119650000902130650001302139650001302152650002202165700001902187700001602206700001602222700002402238700001602262700001702278700002302295700001602318700001702334700002702351700001702378700001902395700002302414773017602437852000902613856008302622930003302705946001302738655001202751IND4428676420221207132859.0091113e20091110xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442867642DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.09106721062doi7 aPMC27685902pmcid7 a198615452pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChoi, Murim10aGenetic diagnosis by whole exome capture and massively parallel DNA sequencing  ap. 19096-19101.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aProtein coding genes constitute only approximately 1% of the human genome but harbor 85% of the mutations with large effects on disease-related traits. Therefore, efficient strategies for selectively sequencing complete coding regions (i.e., "whole exome") have the potential to contribute to the understanding of rare and common human diseases. Here we report a method for whole-exome sequencing coupling Roche/NimbleGen whole exome arrays to the Illumina DNA sequencing platform. We demonstrate the ability to capture approximately 95% of the targeted coding sequences with high sensitivity and specificity for detection of homozygous and heterozygous variants. We illustrate the utility of this approach by making an unanticipated genetic diagnosis of congenital chloride diarrhea in a patient referred with a suspected diagnosis of Bartter syndrome, a renal salt-wasting disease. The molecular diagnosis was based on the finding of a homozygous missense D652N mutation at a position in SLC26A3 (the known congenital chloride diarrhea locus) that is virtually completely conserved in orthologues and paralogues from invertebrates to humans, and clinical follow-up confirmed the diagnosis. To our knowledge, whole-exome (or genome) sequencing has not previously been used to make a genetic diagnosis. Five additional patients suspected to have Bartter syndrome but who did not have mutations in known genes for this disease had homozygous deleterious mutations in SLC26A3. These results demonstrate the clinical utility of whole-exome sequencing and have implications for disease gene discovery and clinical diagnosis.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3adiarrhea 3agenes 3aheterozygosity 3ahomozygosity 3ahuman diseases 3ahumans 3aloci 3amutation 3apatients 3asequence analysis1 aScholl, Ute I.1 aJi, Weizhen1 aLiu, Tiewen1 aTikhonova, Irina R.1 aZumbo, Paul1 aNayir, Ahmet1 aBakkaloƒülu, Aysin1 a√ñzen, Seza1 aSanjad, Sami1 aNelson-Williams, Carol1 aFarhi, Anita1 aMane, Shrikant1 aLifton, Richard P.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2009 Nov. 10, v. 106, no. 45 p.19096-19101dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.09106721063Available from publisher's Web site  a20091113b20091204c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02982naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100002300184245011500207300002000322506007600342520144200418506003701860650002001897650001901917650003601936650001401972650002501986650001602011650001102027650001602038650001202054650000902066700002302075700001702098700002202115700002002137700001802157700002302175773017602198852000902374856008302383930003302466946001302499655001202512IND4428677320221207132149.0091113e20091110xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442867732DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.09092931062doi7 aPMC27764272pmcid7 a199013362pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAcharya, Munjal M.10aRescue of radiation-induced cognitive impairment through cranial transplantation of human embryonic stem cells  ap. 19150-19155.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCranial irradiation remains a frontline treatment for the control of tumor growth, and individuals surviving such treatments often manifest various degrees of cognitive dysfunction. Radiation-induced depletion of stem/precursor cell pools in the brain, particularly those residing in the neurogenic region of the hippocampus, is believed, in part, to be responsible for these often-unavoidable cognitive deficits. To explore the possibility of ameliorating radiation-induced cognitive impairment, athymic nude rats subjected to head only irradiation (10 Gy) were transplanted 2 days afterward with human embryonic stem cells (hESC) into the hippocampal formation and analyzed for stem cell survival, differentiation, and cognitive function. Animals receiving hESC transplantation exhibited superior performance on a hippocampal-dependent cognitive task 4 months postirradiation, compared to their irradiated surgical counterparts that did not receive hESCs. Significant stem cell survival was found at 1 and 4 months postirradiation, and transplanted cells showed robust migration to the subgranular zone throughout the dentate gyrus, exhibiting signs of neuron morphology within this neurogenic niche. These results demonstrate the capability to ameliorate radiation-induced normal tissue injury using hESCs, and suggest that such strategies may provide useful interventions for reducing the adverse effects of irradiation on cognition.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aadverse effects 3acell viability 3acentral nervous system diseases 3acognition 3aembryonic stem cells 3ahippocampus 3ahumans 3airradiation 3aneurons 3arats1 aChristie, Lori-Ann1 aLan, Mary L.1 aDonovan, Peter J.1 aCotman, Carl W.1 aFike, John R.1 aLimoli, Charles L.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2009 Nov. 10, v. 106, no. 45 p.19150-19155dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.09092931063Available from publisher's Web site  a20091113b20091204c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02812naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100002200184245009900206300002000305506007600325520145400401506003701855650003501892650000801927650001101935650001901946650001201965650002001977650002401997650001102021650001202032700002202044700002202066773017602088852000902264856008302273930003302356946001302389655001202402IND4428676720221207132157.0091113e20091110xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442867672DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.09073641062doi7 aPMC27764082pmcid7 a198615492pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJouvenet, Nolwenn10aImaging the interaction of HIV-1 genomes and Gag during assembly of individual viral particles  ap. 19114-19119.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe incorporation of viral genomes into particles has never previously been imaged in live infected cells. Thus, for many viruses it is unknown how the recruitment and packaging of genomes into virions is temporally and spatially related to particle assembly. Here, we devised approaches to simultaneously image HIV-1 genomes, as well as the major HIV-1 structural protein, Gag, to reveal their dynamics and functional interactions during the assembly of individual viral particles. In the absence of Gag, HIV-1 RNA was highly dynamic, moving in and out of the proximity of the plasma membrane. Conversely, in the presence of Gag, RNA molecules docked at the membrane where their lateral movement slowed and then ceased as Gag assembled around them and they became irreversibly anchored. Viral genomes were not retained at the membrane when their packaging signals were mutated, nor when expressed with a Gag mutant that was not myristoylated. In the presence of a Gag mutant that retained membrane- and RNA-binding activities but could not assemble into particles, the viral RNA docked at the membrane but continued to drift laterally and then often dissociated from the membrane. These results, which provide visualization of the recruitment and packaging of genomes into individual virus particles, demonstrate that a small number of Gag molecules recruit viral genomes to the plasma membrane where they nucleate the assembly of complete virions.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aHuman immunodeficiency virus 1 3aRNA 3agenome 3aimage analysis 3amutants 3aplasma membrane 3astructural proteins 3avirion 3aviruses1 aSimon, Sanford M.1 aBieniasz, Paul D.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2009 Nov. 10, v. 106, no. 45 p.19114-19119dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.09073641063Available from publisher's Web site  a20091113b20091204c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02581naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100001900184245012600203300002000329506007600349520130100425506003701726650002601763650002701789650001101816650002501827650001401852650001401866700002501880773017601905852000902081856008302090930003302173946001302206655001202219IND4428676820221207132154.0091113e20091110xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442867682DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.09079121062doi7 aPMC27764262pmcid7 a198508762pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIeva, Raffaele10aInteraction of an autotransporter passenger domain with BamA during its translocation across the bacterial outer membrane  ap. 19120-19125.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aAutotransporters are a superfamily of virulence factors produced by Gram-negative bacteria consisting of a large N-terminal extracellular domain ("passenger domain") and a C-terminal Œ≤ barrel domain ("Œ≤ domain"). The mechanism by which the passenger domain is translocated across the outer membrane (OM) is unknown. Here we show that the insertion of a small linker into the passenger domain of the Escherichia coli O157:H7 autotransporter EspP effectively creates a translocation intermediate by transiently stalling translocation near the site of the insertion. Using a site-specific photocrosslinking approach, we found that residues adjacent to the stall point interact with BamA, a component of a heterooligomeric complex (Bam complex) that catalyzes OM protein assembly, and that residues closer to the EspP N terminus interact with the periplasmic chaperones SurA and Skp. The EspP-BamA interaction was short-lived and could be detected only when passenger domain translocation was stalled. These results support a model in which molecular chaperones prevent misfolding of the passenger domain before its secretion and the Bam complex catalyzes both the integration of the Œ≤ domain into the OM and the translocation of the passenger domain across the OM in a C- to N-terminal direction.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aEscherichia coli O157 3aGram-negative bacteria 3amodels 3amolecular chaperones 3asecretion 3avirulence1 aBernstein, Harris D.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2009 Nov. 10, v. 106, no. 45 p.19120-19125dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.09079121063Available from publisher's Web site  a20091113b20091204c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03023naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100002200184245011200206300002000318506007600338520156600414506003701980650002502017650001502042650001602057650001602073650001202089650001802101650001702119650001002136650001302146650001402159650001202173650001602185700001302201700002002214700001702234773017602251852000902427856008302436930003302519946001302552655001202565IND4428677220221207132156.0091113e20091110xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442867722DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.09086201062doi7 aPMC27764242pmcid7 a198584802pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGobrogge, Kyle L.10aAnterior hypothalamic vasopressin regulates pair-bonding and drug-induced aggression in a monogamous rodent  ap. 19144-19149.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aAfter pair-bonding, male prairie voles (Microtus ochrogaster) display aggression toward novel females but not toward their female partner. Here we show that this selective aggression in pair-bonded male prairie voles is associated with increased release of vasopressin (AVP) in the anterior hypothalamus (AH). Pharmacological activation of AVP-V1a receptors (V1aR) in the AH induced selective aggression in sexually naive males, whereas V1aR blockade diminished selective aggression in pair-bonded males. Pair-bonded males also showed an increased density in V1aR binding in the AH compared to their sexually naive counterparts and overexpression of V1aR in the AH, by viral vector-mediated gene transfer, facilitated aggression toward novel females. These data demonstrate that AH-AVP is both necessary and sufficient in the regulation of selective aggression associated with pair-bonding. In the second part of this study, we examined the effects of amphetamine (AMPH) exposure on female-directed aggression and revealed the potential role of AH-AVP underlying this behavior. Repeated AMPH administration in sexually naive male prairie voles enhanced V1aR expression in the AH and induced aggression toward a familiar or unfamiliar female. In addition, this AMPH-induced aggression was blocked by intra-AH administration of a V1aR antagonist. Together, our data reveal a socioneurobiological mechanism, highlighting a critical role of AH-AVP in the regulation of aggression induced by pair-bonding or drug experience in socially monogamous male prairie voles.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aMicrotus ochrogaster 3aaggression 3aamphetamine 3aantagonists 3afemales 3agene transfer 3ahypothalamus 3amales 3amonogamy 3areceptors 3arodents 3avasopressin1 aLiu, Yan1 aYoung, Larry J.1 aWang, Zuoxin0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2009 Nov. 10, v. 106, no. 45 p.19144-19149dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.09086201063Available from publisher's Web site  a20091113b20091204c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03442naa a2200673 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004100111040001800152100002100170245008600191300001800277500002400295500001500319520153600334650000901870650001001879650001201889650001101901650001801912650001501930650002501945650001301970650000801983650001101991650001502002650001102017650002602028650000902054650001002063650001302073650001102086650001502097650001002112650005302122650002902175650001102204650002102215650001102236650004602247650000902293650004602302650001602348650001102364650002402375650001602399651001802415651001302433651001302446653003602459700002802495700001902523773011402542852000902656856009102665655001202756IND4439021220221120221430.0100625s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443902122DNAL7 a205765432pmid7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2010.04.0272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBeate, Lettmeier10aProposal for a Revised Reference Concentration (RfC) for mercury vapour in adults  ap. 3530-3535.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aWorldwide, approximately 30-50millions of people are living in small scale gold mining areas and are primarily burdened by mercury vapour. In the frame of our study, 306 mercury (Hg) vapour burdened adults, working and/ or living in two small scale gold mining areas in Zimbabwe and Tanzania and 58 volunteers from near-by unburdened communities were medically investigated. In addition, blood, urine and hair samples from each participant were analyzed for mercury. Altogether, 26 anamnestic and 24 clinical signs and symptoms, which may be caused by Hg vapour, were evaluated. Multivariate analysis was performed to investigate the influence of the mercury concentration in the bio-monitors on the evaluated anamnestic and clinical signs and symptoms taking into account age, gender, health status, alcohol consumption, use of pesticides and gasoline sniffing. Out of the resulting correlations between concentration and effect, ROC-curves were calculated to determine best estimates of the cut-off-values in the bio monitors. For the parameters ataxia of gait and sadness cut-off-values of 4.7 and 3.6¬µg Hg/g crea in urine were calculated. These values were converted to a rounded LOAEL of 3.5¬µg Hg vapour/m¬≥ air. In analogy to the US EPA Report (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency 1997) and the European Position Paper (Pirrone et al. 2001), uncertainty factors of 30 and 50 were applied, resulting in a proposed reference concentration (RfC) in ambient air of 0.1¬µg Hg vapour/m¬≥ and 0.07¬µg Hg vapour/m¬≥, respectively. 3agold 3aurine 3amercury 3agender 3ahealth status 3apesticides 3auncertainty analysis 3agasoline 3aair 3avapors 3avolunteers 3amining 3amultivariate analysis 3agait 3ablood 3aalcohols 3aadults 2aAdolescent 2aAdult 2aAir Pollutantsxanalysisxmetabolismxstandards. 2aEnvironmental Monitoring 2aFemale 2aHairxmetabolism 2aHumans 2aInhalation Exposurexanalysisxstandards. 2aMale 2aMercuryxanalysisxmetabolismxstandards. 2aMiddle Aged 2aMining 2aReference Standards 2aYoung Adult 3aUnited States 3aTanzania 3aZimbabwe 0aEnvironmental Protection Agency1 aStephan, Boese-O'Reilly1 aGustav, Drasch0 tScience of the total environment.g2010 Aug. 1, v. 408, no. 17 p.3530-3535dElsevier Sciencex0048-96977nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2010.04.0273Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03942naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002200145245008300167300001600250520238400266650001602650650002602666650001202692650001602704650002002720650001402740650001602754650001202770650001502782650002002797650001002817650002602827650001402853650002202867650001902889650001302908650001402921650001002935650001502945650001002960653001702970653002102987653001203008653002003020653002703040700002303067700002003090700002203110773010603132852000903238856008503247930003303332946001103365655001203376IND4398191620221120212712.0071125e200801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439819162DNAL7 a10.1007/s11258-007-9280-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDovƒçiak, Martin 10aSeed rain and environmental controls on invasion of Picea abies into grassland  ap. 135-148.  aAlthough changes in land-use, climate, and the spread of introduced tree species have increased the global importance of tree invasions into grasslands, our ability to predict any particular invasion is limited. To elucidate mechanisms driving tree invasions of grasslands, we studied in detail how seed dispersal and fine-scale environment control the expansion of an introduced Picea abies Karst. (Norway spruce) population into Western Carpathian grassland. We mapped invading trees and measured tree size, fecundity, seed rain, seedling density, plant community composition, and light and soil environment within a 200 x 60 m belt across the invasion front. Maximum likelihood estimates of dispersal kernels suggested peak seed deposition directly underneath tree crowns where germination was poor, but mean dispersal distances were sufficiently large to generate overlapping seed shadows from multiple trees that saturated the invasion front with seeds further away from seed-dispersing trees. Partial Mantel tests indicated that germinant density was affected considerably less by seed rain than by moss cover (r = 0.54), overstory tree influence (r = -0.32), soil moisture (r = 0.21), grass cover (r = -0.15), and diffuse radiation (r = 0.13). However, these variables were not independent but formed complex multivariate gradients within the invasion front. Moss cover and soil moisture were negatively correlated with overstory tree influence and the resulting gradient clearly affected germinant density (partial Mantel r = 0.45). In contrast, positively correlated light and grass cover defined a gradient related weakly to germinant density (partial Mantel r = 0.05) as it integrated opposing effects of these variables on germinants. Seedlings had similar environmental associations, but except for the lasting positive effects of moss these tended to weaken with seedling size. Although a few seedlings may establish and survive in the more adverse environment of the outer edges of the invasion front, a significant population expansion may require a gradual build-up of the critical density of invading trees to reduce grass cover and facilitate germination on moist mossy seedbeds within uncolonized areas. Thus, Picea abies appears more likely to spread within temperate grasslands by gradual expansion of its population frontier rather than by advanced groups. 3aPicea abies 3abotanical composition 3aclimate 3acorrelation 3aedaphic factors 3afecundity 3agermination 3agrasses 3agrasslands 3aland use change 3alight 3amosses and liverworts 3aoverstory 3apopulation growth 3aseed dispersal 3aseedbeds 3aseedlings 3aseeds 3asoil water 3atrees 0aColonization 0aDispersal kernel 0aEcotone 0aMountain meadow 0aRecruitment limitation1 aHrivn√°k, Richard 1 aUjh√°zy, Karol 1 aG√∂m√∂ry, Du≈°an 0 tPlant ecology.g2008 Jan., v. 194, no. 1 p.135-148dDordrecht : Springer Netherlandsx1385-02377nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11258-007-9280-23Available from publisher's Web site  a20071125b20071210c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02853naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001800145245011300163300001400276520169600290650002001986650002002006650001502026650001002041650001502051650002002066650001402086650001102100650001902111651001202130653001602142653002002158653001802178700001702196773010402213852000902317856008502326930003302411946001102444655001202455IND4398192520221120200837.0071125e200801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439819252DNAL7 a10.1007/s11258-007-9275-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEwers, B.

We tested the chronosequence approach for assessing the change in plant functional type cover and leaf area index (L) using three replicated mountain big sagebrush (Artemesia tridentata var. vaseyana (Rydb.) Boivin) dominated ecosystems in southern Wyoming. We further tested our broader inferences of mountain big sagebrush ecosystem chronosequences by assessing whether dynamics in spatial patterning of plant functional type cover and leaf area index would compromise the chronosequence approach. We hypothesized that (1) L and total cover increase with age at similar rates across replicated chronosequences, (2) spatial autocorrelation is greatest with shrub cover, and (3) spatial autocorrelation increases with age. We failed to reject all three hypotheses. Our analyses showed that mean shrub cover, total cover, and L all increased linearly with time since disturbance across all three replicated chronosequences. While neither graminoid nor forb cover was correlated with time since disturbance, graminoid cover did show an inverse relationship with shrub cover and L. Semivariogram analysis showed that spatial patterning increased with shrub cover and time since disturbance. Thus, while we cannot yet provide a process to fit the spatial patterns, the chronosequence approach for sagebrush ecosystems recovering from disturbance has survived a rigorous test because the mean changes in shrub cover, total cover, and L were replicable across three different sites. 3aautocorrelation 3achronosequences 3aecosystems 3aforbs 3agraminoids 3aleaf area index 3alongevity 3ashrubs 3aspace and time 3aWyoming 0aDisturbance 0aPrescribed burn 0aShrub islands1 aPendall, E. 0 tPlant ecology.g2008 Jan., v. 194, no. 1 p.67-83dDordrecht : Springer Netherlandsx1385-02377nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11258-007-9275-z3Available from publisher's Web site  a20071125b20071210c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03953naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153072000900171072000900180100001700189245009800206300001600304500002400320500001500344520227100359650001502630650003102645650002202676650001102698650001902709650001102728650001202739650001202751650002102763650002802784650001102812650002402823650004702847653002702894653002302921653001902944653002202963700001902985700001903004700002003023700002003043700002003063700001803083773010203101852000903203856009203212930003303304945002503337946001303362655001203375IND4421372120221120200726.0090605e200906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442137212DNAL7 a195386652pmid7 a10.1111/j.1532-950X.2009.00525.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL840 0aL8001 aDART, ANDREW10aEffect of Prosthesis Number and Position on Rima Glottidis Area in Equine Laryngeal Specimens  ap. 452-456.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aTo assess the effect of 1 or 2 laryngeal prosthetic sutures on rima glottidis areas in equine laryngeal specimens. Experimental, randomized design. Cadaveric equine larynges (n=16). Larynges were collected from 10 horses; 2 sutures each were preplaced in the right and left sides of each larynx. A dorsal suture (DS) was placed through the caudal rim of the dorsal midline of the cricoid cartilage, under the cricopharyngeus muscle and through the proximal and rostral aspect of the muscular process. A lateral suture (LS) was placed 1.5 cm lateral to the DS and through the muscular process more distal and caudal to the 1st suture. Larynges were positioned in a customized stand and the rima glottidis photographed after each suture (LS or DS) or suture combination (CS) was tied in random sequence. An additional 6 larynxes were used to determine whether the tension applied to the sutures was repeatable. Sutures were preplaced in both the right and left side of each larynx as described above and each suture and CS was tied and released 3 times in each larynx. Photographs were taken of the rima glottidis after each suture or CS was tied generating 3 replicates for each suture configuration on each side of the 6 larynges. Mean rima glottidis area was not different between DS and LS when tied alone (P=.85); however, mean area after CS (DS+LS) was greater than DS (P<.001) and LS (P<.001) alone. The coefficient of variation for the 6 suture patterns were low (1-7%) and the intraclass correlation coefficient estimates were very high (0.997-0.998) demonstrating excellent repeatability between replicates for each of the 3 suture configurations. Our results suggest that laryngoplasty using 2 prostheses; 1 placed dorsally in the cricoid and through the rostral and proximal muscular process and 1 placed 1.5 cm lateral to the 1st and more caudal and distal in the muscular process results in a greater cross sectional area of the rima glottidis than either suture used alone. Seemingly prosthetic sutures contribute independently to each other in determining the contour of the rima glottidis. Use of 2 prosthetic sutures improves crosssectional area of the rima glottidis compared with each suture alone and may improve surgical outcome in laryngoplasty. 3aprostheses 3arespiratory tract diseases 3asuture techniques 3alarynx 3ahorse diseases 3ahorses 3asutures 2aAnimals 2aGlottisxsurgery 2aHorse Diseasesxsurgery 2aHorses 2aSuturesxveterinary 2aVocal Cord Paralysisxsurgeryxveterinary. 0acricopharyngeus muscle 0arespiratory system 0arima glottidis 0acricoid cartilage1 aTEE, ELIZABETH1 aBRENNAN, MOSES1 aDART, CHRISTINA1 aPerkins, Nigel.1 aCHAPMAN, STELLA1 aDEBNEY, SALLY0 tVeterinary surgery.g2009 June, v. 38, no. 4 p.452-456dBlackwell Publishing Incx0161-34997nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1532-950X.2009.00525.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20090730b20090801c00000000  aINDd6CTe2009/07/07  aOther US 7aarticle02337naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131100001600149245005300165300001600218500002400234520121300258650003601471650001601507650001701523650002201540650002301562650001101585650002201596650001301618650001001631700001801641700001601659700001901675700002501694700001601719700001601735773009001751852000901841856008901850655001201939IND4463997120221120191133.0120831s2003    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446399712DNAL7 a10.1016/S0308-8146(02)00272-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aValette, L.10aVolatile constituents from Romanesco cauliflower  ap. 353-358.  aIncludes references  aThe volatile and semi-volatile constituents of Brassica oleracea L. var. Botrytis L., Romanesco group, Navona variety, were extracted by steam distillation from leaves and inflorescence, using a Likens-Nickerson-type apparatus. The extracts from fresh, ripening and frozen vegetables were investigated by gas chromatography and mass spectrometry. From the fresh leaves extract, a total of 61 compounds were identified, representing 96.8% of the oil. The major constituent was found to be hex-3(Z)-enol (61.1%). From fresh disrupted inflorescence tissues of Romanesco, 35 compounds were detected, representing 97.7% of the extract. Dimethyl disulfide, dimethyl trisulfide and hex-3(Z)-enol were identified as major constituents of the hydrodistillation products, representing, respectively, 30.2, 24.2 and 21.7% of the volatiles. From ripening and frozen inflorescence tissues, dimethyl disulfide and trisulfide were again detected as predominant components. In the latter, hex-3(Z)-enol had almost disappeared (0.8%) whereas dimethyl trisulfide represented 49.7% of the oil. This is the first report concerning the steam distillation compounds present in the leaves and inflorescence tissues of this species. 3aBrassica oleracea var. botrytis 3acauliflower 3adistillation 3afrozen vegetables 3agas chromatography 3aleaves 3amass spectrometry 3aripening 3asteam1 aFernandez, X.1 aPoulain, S.1 aLoiseau, A.-M.1 aLizzani-Cuvelier, L.1 aLevieil, R.1 aRestier, L.0 tFood chemistry.g2003 Mar., v. 80, no. 3 p.353-358dElsevier Sciencex0308-81467nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0308-8146(02)00272-83Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03493naa a2200673 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153072000900171072000900180100002000189245013400209300001600343500002400359520143600383650000901819650001701828650001601845650002001861650001501881650001901896650001101915650002501926650001201951650003101963650001501994650001202009650001902021650004002040650002602080650000902106650001102115650005902126650004002185650000902225650003002234653003002264653002002294653003302314653003002347653002002377653002102397700001802418700001802436700002202454700001702476700001902493700002102512773010202533852000902635856009202644930003302736945002502769946001302794655001202807IND4421372220221120191119.0090605e200906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442137222DNAL7 a195386662pmid7 a10.1111/j.1532-950X.2009.00529.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL840 0aL8001 aMALIK, YASMINDA10aLaser-Doppler Measurements of Spinal Cord Blood Flow Changes During Hemilaminectomy in Chondrodystrophic Dogs with Disk Extrusion  ap. 457-462.  aIncludes references  a(1) To assess spinal cord blood flow (SCBF) during surgical treatment of disk extrusion in dogs and (2) to investigate associations between SCBF, clinical signs, presurgical MRI images, and 24-hour surgical outcome. Cohort study. Chondrodystrophic dogs with thoracolumbar disk extrusion (n=12). Diagnosis was based on clinical signs and MRI findings, and confirmed at surgery. Regional SCBF was measured intraoperatively by laser-Doppler flowmetry before, immediately after surgical spinal cord decompression, and after 15 minutes of lavaging the lesion. Care was taken to ensure a standardized surgical procedure to minimize factors that could influence measurement readings. A significant increase in intraoperative SCBF was found in all dogs (Wilcoxon's signed-rank test; P=.05) immediately after spinal cord decompression and after 15 minutes. Changes in SCBF were not associated with duration of clinical signs; initial or 24-hour neurologic status; or degree of spinal cord compression assessed by MRI. SCBF increases immediately after spinal cord decompression in dogs with disk herniation; however, increased SCBF was not associated with a diminished 24-hour neurologic status. An increase in SCBF does not appear to be either associated with the degree of spinal cord compression or of a magnitude sufficient to outweigh the benefit of surgical decompression by resulting in clinically relevant changes in 24-hour outcome. 3adogs 3adog diseases 3aspinal cord 3aspinal diseases 3ablood flow 3acohort studies 3ahernia 3aintervertebral disks 3asurgery 3amagnetic resonance imaging 3aflowmeters 2aAnimals 2aCohort Studies 2aDecompression, Surgicalxveterinary 2aDog Diseasesxsurgery 2aDogs 2aFemale 2aIntervertebral Disc Displacementxsurgeryxveterinary. 2aLaser-Doppler Flowmetryxveterinary 2aMale 2aSpinal Cordxblood supply 0alaser-doppler measurement 0ahemilaminectomy 0athoracolumbar disk extrusion 0aspinal cord decompression 0adisk herniation 0achondrodystrophy1 aSPRENG, DAVID1 aKONAR, MARTIN1 aDOHERR, MARCUS G.1 aJAGGY, ANDRE1 aHOWARD, JUDITH1 aFORTERRE, FRANCK0 tVeterinary surgery.g2009 June, v. 38, no. 4 p.457-462dBlackwell Publishing Incx0161-34997nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1532-950X.2009.00529.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20090730b20090801c00000000  aINDd6CTe2009/07/07  aOther US 7aarticle03548naa a2200661 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153072000900171072000900180100002300189245009500212300001600307500002400323520162400347650000901971650001701980650001901997650001502016650001802031650002002049650001702069650001602086650001602102650002502118650001202143650001502155650001202170650001402182650000902196650001202205650003402217650002202251650001102273650005502284650001302339650000902352650002202361653003102383653002502414653002402439653001802463653002202481653003302503700002202536700002102558700002102579773010202600852000902702856009202711930003302803945002502836946001302861655001202874IND4421372920221120181507.0090605e200906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442137292DNAL7 a195386732pmid7 a10.1111/j.1532-950X.2009.00519.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL800 0aL8401 aPETAZZONI, MASSIMO10aCorrection of Rotational Deformity of the Pes with External Skeletal Fixation in Four Dogs  ap. 506-514.  aIncludes references  aTo report unilateral correction and initial stabilization with external skeletal fixation (ESF) of metatarsal rotation in 4 immature Bernese Mountain Dogs. Case series. Bernese Mountain Dogs (n=4). The limb deformity, including degree and origin of the deformity at the level of the proximal intertarsal joint and involvement of the central tarsal bone, was characterized by clinical and radiographic assessment. Unilateral surgical correction of the most severely affected limb was performed by disrupting the ligaments and debriding the articular cartilage of the proximal intertarsal joint to allow for derotation of the deformity and arthrodesis of the proximal intertarsal joint stabilized with either circular or linear ESF. Initial metatarsal rotation of the corrected limbs ranged from 60¬∞ to 80¬∞ of external rotation (mean, 72.5¬∞). Three limb corrections were stabilized with circular ESF and 1 with a biplanar linear ESF. Implants were removed at the time of radiographic bony union (range, 7-10 weeks; mean, 8.6 weeks). Residual deformity was minimal, ranging from 6¬∞ to 15¬∞ (mean, 11¬∞). Two minor complications (loosening of 1 pin, serous drainage from 1 pin) resolved with treatment. Correction of rotational deformity of the pes with intertarsal arthrodesis yielded an excellent clinical outcome, with only a mild residual deformity. Rotational metatarsal deformities can have a significant impact on gait, ambulation, and appearance. Correction of these deformities and stabilization with ESF and intratarsal arthrodesis can yield an excellent functional outcome, with improved gait and ambulation. 3adogs 3adog diseases 3alimbs (animal) 3ametatarsus 3atarsus (bone) 3ajoints (animal) 3acase studies 3aadolescence 3aradiography 3aclinical examination 3asurgery 3adog breeds 3awalking 3aligaments 3agait 2aAnimals 2aDogsxabnormalitiesxsurgery. 2aExternal Fixators 2aFemale 2aFoot Deformities, Congenitalxsurgeryxveterinary. 2aHindlimb 2aMale 2aTreatment Outcome 0aexternal skeletal fixation 0arotational deformity 0aarticular cartilage 0aarthrodesisis 0aintertarsal joint 0aBernese Mountain (dog breed)1 aPIRAS, ALESSANDRO1 aJAEGER, GAYLE H.1 aMARIONI, CLAUDIO0 tVeterinary surgery.g2009 June, v. 38, no. 4 p.506-514dBlackwell Publishing Incx0161-34997nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1532-950X.2009.00519.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20090730b20090801c00000000  aINDd6CTe2009/07/11  aOther US 7aarticle02849naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134072000900152072000900161072000900170100001800179245009900197300001600296500002400312500001500336520163300351650001701984650002002001650001902021650002002040650001002060650001302070653001102083653003202094700001702126773012402143852000902267856009202276930003302368945002502401946001302426655001202439IND4421383020221120171236.0090605e200906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442138302DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1749-7345.2009.00254.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aM120 0aL600 0aM0011 aYasir, Inayah10aEffect of Light Intensity on Color Performance of False Clownfish, Amphiprion ocellaris Cuvier  ap. 337-350.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aColor performance of false clownfish, Amphiprion ocellaris Cuvier, was examined under three levels of light intensity (20-50 , 600-850 , and 2700-3500 lx) for 5 wk. The experiment was conducted in nine rectangular glass aquaria (25 x 25 x 20 cm) with three replicates. Each aquarium was stocked with 36 fish, and 3 fish were randomly sampled from each aquarium every other week. Digital images were taken weekly on each individual fish after it was anesthetized in MS-222. The color performance in hue, saturation, and brightness was quantified using image analysis. In addition to the whole-body analysis, each fish image was divided into ventral and dorsal parts to assess the body position-dependent effect. Furthermore, color differences between dorsal fin, anal fin, ventral fin, and caudal fin were also quantified. The whole body was brighter at low light than at medium or at high light intensity. Irrespective of light intensity, the dorsal side was more orange but less bright than the ventral side. Brighter light strengthened overall orange color on fish fins. The dorsal fin and ventral fins appeared more orange than the anal and caudal fins regardless of light intensity and exposure duration. Similar to body color, low light also led to brighter fins, especially for caudal and dorsal fins. Our results indicate that ambient light could regulate fish color performance but could not change the pigment dominance by Œ≤-carotene. Light intensity is unlikely to change the contrast between dorsal and ventral sides, but dim light tends to make fish body brighter, and bright light strengthens orange color on fins. 3afish culture 3aornamental fish 3aimage analysis 3alight intensity 3acolor 3apigments 0atraits 0aAmphiprion ocellaris Cuvier1 aQin, Jian G.0 tJournal of the World Aquaculture Society.g2009 June, v. 40, no. 3 p.337-350dBlackwell Publishing Incx0893-88497nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1749-7345.2009.00254.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20090806b20091002c00000000  aINDdGAYe2009/08/06  aOther US 7aarticle03070naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003800111040001800149072000900167072000900176100002600185245013200211300001800343500002400361500001500385520128200400650001301682650001101695650001901706650001701725650001501742650001501757650002301772650003601795650002501831650002701856650003901883650003101922650002401953650001101977650004501988650003802033650003102071653001302102653001302115700002402128700001402152700001502166720002402181773012102205852000902326856008802335930003302423945002502456946001102481655001202492IND4421339820221120161733.0090605e200906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442133982DNAL7 a192461402pmid7 a10.1016/j.envpol.2009.01.0172doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aW000 0aL8101 aPeterson, Jonathan W.10aSorption mechanisms of cephapirin, a veterinary antibiotic, onto quartz and feldspar minerals as detected by Raman spectroscopy  ap. 1849-1856.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aRaman spectroscopy was used to investigate sorption mechanisms of cephapirin (CHP), a veterinary antibiotic, onto quartz (SiO‚ÇÇ) and feldspar (KAlSi‚ÇÉO‚Çà) at different pH. Sorption occurs by electrostatic attraction, monodentate and bidentate complexation. The zwitterion (CHP‚Å∞) adsorbs to a quartz(+) surface by electrostatic attraction of the carboxylate anion group (-COO-) at low pH, but adsorbs to a quartz(-) surface through electrostatic attraction of the pyridinium cation, and possibly COO- bridge complexes, at higher pH. CHP- bonds to quartz(-) surfaces by bidentate complexation between one oxygen of -COO- and oxygen from carbonyl of an acetoxymethyl group. On a feldspar(+/-) surface, CHP‚Å∞ forms monodentate complexes between CO, and possible -COO- bridges and/or electrostatic attachments to localized edge (hydr)oxy-Al surfaces. CHP- adsorbs to feldspar(-) through monodentate CO complexation. Similar mechanisms may operate for other cephalosporins. Results demonstrate, for the first time, that Raman techniques can be effective for evaluating sorption mechanisms of antibiotics. Raman spectroscopy indicates that cephapirin, a veterinary antibiotic, sorbs to quartz and feldspar by electrostatic attraction, and monodentate and bidentate complexation. 3akinetics 3aquartz 3acephalosporins 3aspectroscopy 3aadsorption 2aAdsorption 2aAluminum Silicates 2aAnti-Bacterial Agentsxanalysis 2aCephapirinxanalysis 2aEcotoxicologyxmethods 2aEnvironmental Pollutantsxanalysis 2aHydrogen-Ion Concentration 2aPotassium Compounds 2aQuartz 2aSpectroscopy, Fourier Transform Infrared 2aSpectrum Analysis, Ramanxmethods 2aVeterinary Drugsxanalysis 0asorption 0aminerals1 aSeymour, Michael D.1 aWang, Wei1 aGu, Baohua  aO'Meara, Theresa A.0 tEnvironmental pollution.g2009 June, v. 157, no. 6 p.1849-1856dElsevier Applied Science Publishersx0269-74917nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2009.01.0173Available from publisher's Web site  a20090701b20090703c00000000  aINDdGAYe2009/07/01  aNon-US 7aarticle03195naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003800111040001800149072000900167100001400176245018000190300001800370500002400388520117600412650001101588650002001599650002001619650002001639650002001659650001901679650001801698650002701716650002701743650001201770650002901782650005901811650005601870650003301926650003801959650005001997650002302047650003402070650001102104650001102115650004102126650005202167651001002219651001002229653002302239700001702262700002702279773012102306852000902427856008802436930003302524945002502557946001102582655001202593IND4421338820221120064327.0090605e200906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442133882DNAL7 a191682702pmid7 a10.1016/j.envpol.2008.12.0262doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aW0001 aGuo, Ying10aOccurrence, source diagnosis, and biological effect assessment of DDT and its metabolites in various environmental compartments of the Pearl River Delta, South China: A review  ap. 1753-1763.  aIncludes references  aThis review summarizes and analyzes available data in the literature (mostly after 2000) on the occurrence of dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) and its main metabolites, dichlorodiphenyldichloroethane (DDD) and chlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDE), in the environment of the Pearl River Delta (PRD), South China. Generally, the concentration levels of the sum of DDT, DDD, and DDE, designated as DDTs thereafter, have not significantly declined since 1983. However, the composition of DDTs residues has changed with time. DDTs in soil, freshwater sediment and freshwater fish species were mainly residues from chronological use. There is evidence that new point sources, such as dicofol and anti-fouling paint, may have contributed DDTs to various environmental compartments. Risk assessment against existing criteria indicated that the levels of DDTs in water and some fish species may pose adverse effects to humans or wildlife, and those in sediment/soil may also cause negative impacts to the eco-environment of the PRD. The occurrence, possible input sources, and biological effects of DDTs in the environment of the Pearl River Delta, South China, are reviewed. 3arivers 3aDDT (pesticide) 3aDDD (pesticide) 3aDDE (pesticide) 3awater pollution 3asoil pollution 3aair pollution 3asediment contamination 3apoint source pollution 2aAnimals 2aDDTxanalysisxtoxicity. 2aDichlorodiphenyl Dichloroethylenexanalysisxtoxicity. 2aDichlorodiphenyldichloroethanexanalysisxtoxicity. 2aDicofolxanalysisxtoxicity. 2aEnvironmental Monitoringxmethods 2aEnvironmental Pollutantsxanalysisxtoxicity. 2aFood Contamination 2aGeologic Sedimentsxchemistry 2aHumans 2aRivers 2aSoil Pollutantsxanalysisxtoxicity. 2aWater Pollutants, Chemicalxanalysisxtoxicity. 3aChina 0aChina 0aliterature reviews1 aYu, Huan-Yun1 aZeng, E.

Dairy manures (n =107) were collected from farms in Maryland, Virginia, Pennsylvania, New York, and Connecticut. The composition of these manures ranged from 14 to 386 g dry matter kg-1, 0.9 to 9.5 kg total N/m3, and 0.3 to 4.7 kg NH(4+)-N/m3. Manure-amended soil was aerobically incubated at 25 degrees C and concentrations of NH(4+)-N and NO(3-)-N were determined at day 2 and day 56. The manures were highly variable in their N mineralization characteristics, ranging from a net mineralization of 54.9% to a net immobilization of 29.2% of the organic N. When compositional parameters were individually regressed against percentage mineralized organic N, the highest correlation coefficient (r) was 0.164. A stepwise regression of all 11 variables yielded a maximal r of 0.486. These results suggest that the availability of dairy manure organic N is highly variable and that the availability cannot be predicted from simple compositional parameters. No relationship was found between near-infrared spectral characteristics and N mineralization suggesting that no simple relationship exists between N mineralization and compositional characteristics. There appears to be some potential for the use of mid-infrared for determining the mineralization potential of manures. 3amineralization 3acattle manure 3aorganic nitrogen compounds 3asoil microorganisms 3abiological activity in soil 3ainfrared spectroscopy 3adegradation 3aammonium nitrogen 3aprediction 0achemical composition 0anitrogen content 0adry matter 0aimmobilization 0anear-infrared diffuse reflectance spectroscopy 0amid-infrared diffuse reflectance spectroscopy1 aReeves, J.B.

Warming trends in atmospheric and upper ocean temperatures, attributed to anthropogenic influence, have occurred over the past four decades. Changes in upper ocean temperature influence stratification and can affect the availability of nutrients for phytoplankton production. Global warming has been predicted to intensify stratification and reduce vertical mixing. Research also suggests that such reduced mixing will enhance variability in primary production and carbon export flux to the deep sea. The dependence of deep-sea communities on surface water production has raised important questions about how climate change will affect carbon cycling and deep-ocean ecosystem function. Recently, unprecedented time-series studies conducted over the past two decades in the North Pacific and the North Atlantic at >4,000-m depth have revealed unexpectedly large changes in deep-ocean ecosystems significantly correlated to climate-driven changes in the surface ocean that can impact the global carbon cycle. Climate-driven variation affects oceanic communities from surface waters to the much-overlooked deep sea and will have impacts on the global carbon cycle. Data from these two widely separated areas of the deep ocean provide compelling evidence that changes in climate can readily influence deep-sea processes. However, the limited geographic coverage of these existing time-series studies stresses the importance of developing a more global effort to monitor deep-sea ecosystems under modern conditions of rapidly changing climate.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aanthropogenic activities 3acarbon 3acarbon cycle 3aclimate 3aecosystems 3afood availability 3aglobal warming 3amixing 3anutrients 3aorganic production 3aphytoplankton 3aprimary productivity 3asurface water 3atime series analysis 3awater temperature1 aRuhl, H.A.1 aBett, B.J.1 aBillett, D.S.M.1 aLampitt, R.S.1 aKaufmann, R.S.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2009 Nov. 17, v. 106, no. 46 p.19211-19218dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.09083221063Available from publisher's Web site  a20091120b20091204c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle01692naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131100002200149245010000171300001600271500002400287520071200311650002001023650001801043650002301061650001401084650001301098650001601111650000901127700002001136700002201156773009001178852000901268856008901277655001201366IND4463966920221120055236.0120824s2003    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446396692DNAL7 a10.1016/S0308-8146(03)00005-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHwang, Bao-Shyung12aA rapid gas chromatographic method for the determination of histamine in fish and fish products  ap. 329-334.  aIncludes references  aA gas chromatographic (GC) method, which reduced the time for determination of histamine in fish and fish products to less than 20 min, was demonstrated.

The genomic organization of tilapia granzyme-1 (TLGR-1) has the signature five-exon-four-intron structure shared by all granzymes and similar hematopoietic Ser proteases. Molecular modeling studies suggested a granzyme-like structure for this protein with four disulfide linkages and two additional Cys residues. The expression of this gene is found to be restricted to cytotoxic cell populations with a low level of constitutive expression when compared to similar granzymes in other teleost species. High levels of transcriptional activation of TLGR-1 with different stimuli suggested that this gene is highly induced during immune reactions. Triplet residues around the active site Ser of TLGR, which determines the primary substrate specificity of granzymes, differ significantly from that of other granzymes. Recombinant TLGR-1 was expressed in the mature and proenzyme forms using pPICZ-alpha vector in the Pichia pastoris expression system. Recombinant TLGR-1 was used to determine the primary substrate specificity of this protease using various synthetic thiobenzyl ester substrates. In vitro enzyme kinetics assays suggested a preference for residues with bulky side chains at the P‚ÇÅ site, indicating a chymase-like activity for this protease. These results indicate the presence of novel granzymes in cytotoxic cells from ectothermic vertebrates. 3acytotoxicity 3anatural killer cells 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAnimals 2aBase Sequence 2aChymases 2aCichlidsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aLipopolysaccharidesxpharmacology 2aModels, Molecular 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPeptide Hydrolasesxmetabolism 2aPhorbol Estersxpharmacology 2aPhylogeny 2aProtein Structure, Tertiary 2aSequence Homology, Amino Acid 2aSerine Endopeptidasesxbloodxchemistryxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aSubstrate Specificity 2aTranscription, Genetic 2aTumor Necrosis Factor-alphaxpharmacology 0aGranzyme 0aTeleosts 0aNonspecific cytotoxic cells1 aLeary, John H.

The total concentration of the 16 USEPA priority PAHs in surface sediments ranged from 42.5 to 158.2 ng/g dry weight with a mean concentration of 126.2 ng/g. The spatial distribution of PAHs was site-specific and combustion processes were the main source of PAHs in the surface sediments. Total 16 priority PAH concentration in the cores 8 and 10 ranged from 77.4 to 305.7 ng/g and from 118.1 to 319.9 ng/g respectively. The variation of the 16 PAH concentrations in both cores followed the economic development in China very well and was also influenced by input pathways. Some of the PAHs were petrogenic in core 8 while pyrolytic source was dominant in core 10. In addition, pyrolytic PAHs in both cores were mainly from the coal and/or grass and wood combustion. A survey of sediments from Daya Bay serves as a baseline study for levels, distributions and possible sources of PAHs in surface sediments and both core sediments. 3aestuarine sediments 3asediment contamination 3apolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 3aspatial distribution 3atemporal variation 2aCoal 2aEnvironmental Monitoringxmethods 2aGeologic Sedimentsxchemistry 2aIndustrial Waste 2aPoaceae 2aPolycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbonsxanalysis. 2aSeawater 2aSoil Pollutantsxanalysis 2aWater Pollutants, Chemical 2aWood 3aChina 0aChina1 aChi, Jisong1 aWang, Zhiyuan1 aHuang, Weixia1 aZhang, Gan0 tEnvironmental pollution.g2009 June, v. 157, no. 6 p.1823-1830dElsevier Applied Science Publishersx0269-74917nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2009.01.0233Available from publisher's Web site  a20090701b20090703c00000000  aINDdGAYe2009/07/01  aNon-US 7aarticle02919naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003800111040001800149072000900167100001300176245011000189300001800299500002400317520114000341650002001481650002301501650002501524650001301549650001901562650001501581650001501596650002301611650001501634650002801649650003101677650003501708650001701743650002201760650003401782650002501816650004501841650002101886650004101907650003201948700001201980700001301992700001602005700001602021700001702037773012102054852000902175856008802184930003302272945002502305946001102330655001202341IND4421341220221120032920.0090605e200906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442134122DNAL7 a192335282pmid7 a10.1016/j.envpol.2009.01.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aW0001 aLi, Ying10aSelective removal of 2,4-dichlorophenol from contaminated water using non-covalent imprinted microspheres  ap. 1879-1885.  aIncludes references  aA molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP) for selective removal of 2,4-dichlorophenol (2,4-DCP) in water was prepared as microspheres by the reverse microemulsion polymerization method based on the non-covalent interactions between 2,4-DCP, oleic acid, and divinylbenzene in acetonitrile. Microspheres have been characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectrometer (FTIR) and energy dispersive X-ray spectrometer (EDS) studies with evidence of 2,4-DCP linkage in polymer particles and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) to study their morphological properties. The proper adsorption and selective recognition ability of the MIP were studied by an equilibrium-adsorption method. The MIP showed outstanding affinity towards 2,4-DCP in aqueous solution and the optimum pH value for binding has been found around the neutral range. The molecular recognition of 2,4-DCP was analyzed in detail by using molecular modeling software. In addition, by investigating the variation in the adsorption ability of the MIP, it clearly showed excellent reproducibility. Molecular imprinting has potential as a remediation technology in water treatment. 3awater pollution 3a2,4-dichlorophenol 3awastewater treatment 3apolymers 3apolymerization 3aadsorption 3aextraction 3asorption isotherms 2aAdsorption 2aChlorophenolsxanalysis 2aHydrogen-Ion Concentration 2aMicroscopy, Electron, Scanning 2aMicrospheres 2aModels, Molecular 2aMolecular Imprintingxmethods 2aPesticidesxanalysis 2aSpectroscopy, Fourier Transform Infrared 2aWaterxchemistry 2aWater Pollutants, Chemicalxanalysis 2aWater Purificationxmethods1 aLi, Xin1 aLi, Yuqi1 aQi, Jingyao1 aBian, Jiang1 aYuan, Yixing0 tEnvironmental pollution.g2009 June, v. 157, no. 6 p.1879-1885dElsevier Applied Science Publishersx0269-74917nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2009.01.0143Available from publisher's Web site  a20090702b00000000c00000000  aINDdGAYe2009/07/02  aNon-US 7aarticle03313naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001800128245008500146300001800231500001500249520152000264650001301784650002501797650002201822650003401844650002001878650001101898650001301909650001901922650001801941650002901959650001301988650001502001650004002016650003002056650003102086650009902117650002302216650001902239650002002258650007502278650003802353650006702391653001202458653001402470653001502484653003702499700001802536700001802554773009502572852000902667930003302676945001302709946001302722655001202735IND2056187020221120032755.0970327e19960216mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205618702DNAL7 a86319272pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrandes, H.K.14aThe molecular pathway for the regulation of phosphoribulokinase by thioredoxin f  ap. 3333-3335.  a2019-12-05  aPhosphoribulokinase (PRK) is one of several plant enzymes that is regulated by thiol-disulfide exchange as mediated by thioredoxin, which contains spatially vicinal, redox-active cysteinyl residues. In an earlier study (Brandes, H.K., Larimer, F.W., Geck, M.K., Stringer, C.D., Schurmann, P., and Hartman, F.C. (1993) J. Biol. Chem 268, 18411-18414), our laboratory identified Cys-46 of thioredoxin f (Trx), as opposed to the other candidate Cys-49, as the primary nucleophile that attacks the disulfide of target proteins. The goal of the present study was to identify which of the two redoxactive cysteinyl residues of PRK (Cys-16 or Cys-55) is paired with Cys-46 of Trx in the interprotein disulfide intermediate of the overall oxidation-reduction pathway. Incubation of a mixture of the C16S mutant of PRK and the C49S mutant of Trx with Cu2+ results in covalent complex formation as detected by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Complexation is fully reversible by dithiothreitol and is retarded by ligands for PRK. Under the same conditions, Cu2+ induces very little complex formation between the following pairs of mutants: C16S PRK/C46S Trx, C55S PRK/C49S Trx, and C55S PRK/C46S Trx. When either 5-thio-2-nitrobenzoate-derivatized C16S or C55S PRK, as mimics of the oxidized (disulfide) form of the enzyme, is mixed with C49S Trx, stable covalent complex formation occurs only with the C16S PRK. Thus, two independent approaches identify Cys-55 of PRK in the intermolecular disulfide pairing with Trx. 3asulfides 3abiochemical pathways 3asulfhydryl groups 3aphosphotransferases (kinases) 3asulfur proteins 3athiols 3acysteine 3aplant proteins 2aBinding Sites 2aChloroplast Thioredoxins 2aCysteine 2aDisulfides 2aElectrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel 2aMacromolecular Substances 2aMutagenesis, Site-Directed 2aPhosphotransferases (Alcohol Group Acceptor)xchemistryxisolation & purificationxmetabolism. 2aPlantsxenzymology 2aPoint Mutation 2aProtein Binding 2aRecombinant Proteinsxchemistryxisolation & purificationxmetabolism. 2aSulfhydryl Reagentsxpharmacology 2aThioredoxinsxchemistryxisolation & purificationxmetabolism. 0akinases 0areduction 0aregulation 0athiol disulfide exchange pathway1 aLarimer, F.W.1 aHartman, F.C.0 tJournal of biological chemistry.g1996 Feb. 16, v. 271, no. 7 p.3333-3335x0021-92587nnas  aDNAL  a19970501b19970508c00000000  aINDdLDP  aOther US 7aarticle02573naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003800111040001800149072000900167072000900176100001600185245004700201300001800248500002400266520102300290650002001313650001401333650001501347650001501362650002501377650001901402650001601421650002901437650001901466650001301485650002101498650005501519650001601574650001401590650001301604650002601617650002001643650003101663700001501694700001801709700001701727773012101744852000901865856008801874930003301962945002501995946001102020655001202031IND4421340220221120030128.0090605e200906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442134022DNAL7 a192690752pmid7 a10.1016/j.envpol.2009.01.0252doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aW000 0aP2001 aWrenn, B.A.10aDispersibility of crude oil in fresh water  ap. 1807-1814.  aIncludes references  aThe effects of surfactant composition on the ability of chemical dispersants to disperse crude oil in fresh water were investigated. The objective of this research was to determine whether effective fresh water dispersants can be designed in case this technology is ever considered for use in fresh water environments. Previous studies on the chemical dispersion of crude oil in fresh water neither identified the dispersants that were investigated nor described the chemistry of the surfactants used. This information is necessary for developing a more fundamental understanding of chemical dispersion of crude oil at low salinity. Therefore, we evaluated the relationship between surfactant chemistry and dispersion effectiveness. We found that dispersants can be designed to drive an oil slick into the freshwater column with the same efficiency as in salt water as long as the hydrophilic-lipophilic balance is optimum. This study was conducted to advance our understanding of dispersion chemistry in fresh waters. 3awater pollution 3apetroleum 3aoil spills 3afreshwater 3aspatial distribution 3adispersibility 3asurfactants 3ahydrophilic interactions 3ahydrophobicity 3asalinity 2aEcologyxmethods 2aEnvironmental Restoration and Remediationxmethods 2aFresh Water 2aPetroleum 2aSeawater 2aSurface-Active Agents 2aWater Movements 2aWater Pollutants, Chemical1 aVirkus, A.1 aMukherjee, B.1 aVenosa, A.D.0 tEnvironmental pollution.g2009 June, v. 157, no. 6 p.1807-1814dElsevier Applied Science Publishersx0269-74917nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2009.01.0253Available from publisher's Web site  a20090701b20090703c00000000  aINDdGAYe2009/07/01  aNon-US 7aarticle03360naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002400145245011900169300001600288520188000304650001202184650002402196650001502220650002602235650001202261650001002273650001202283650001902295650001902314650001302333650001802346650001302364650002102377650002202398650000902420650002302429650002802452650002002480650001502500651001502515653003102530653002102561700002202582773011202604852000902716856008502725930003302810946001102843655001202854IND4392885720221120030237.0070702e200708  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439288572DNAL7 a10.1007/s11258-006-9238-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPerakis, Steven S. 10aImprint of oaks on nitrogen availability and Œ¥¬π‚ÅµN in California grassland-savanna: a case of enhanced N inputs  ap. 209-220.  aWoody vegetation is distributed patchily in many arid and semi-arid ecosystems, where it is often associated with elevated nitrogen (N) pools and availability in islands of fertility. We measured N availability and Œ¥¬π‚ÅµN in paired blue-oak versus annual grass dominated patches to characterize the causes and consequences of spatial variation in N dynamics of grassland-savanna in Sequoia-Kings Canyon National Park. We found significantly greater surface soil N pools (0-20 cm) in oak patches compared to adjacent grass areas across a 700 m elevation gradient from foothills to the savanna-forest boundary. N accumulation under oaks was associated with a 0.6[per thousand] depletion in soil Œ¥¬π‚ÅµN relative to grass patches. Results from a simple Œ¥¬π‚ÅµN mass balance simulation model, constrained by surface soil N and Œ¥¬π‚ÅµN measured in the field, suggest that the development of islands of N fertility under oaks can be traced primarily to enhanced N inputs. Net N mineralization and percent nitrification in laboratory incubations were consistently higher under oaks across a range of experimental soil moisture regimes, suggesting a scenario whereby greater N inputs to oak patches result in net N accumulation and enhanced N cycling, with a potential for greater nitrate loss as well. N concentrations of three common herbaceous annual plants were nearly 50% greater under oak than in adjacent grass patches, with community composition shifted towards more N-demanding species under oaks. We find that oaks imprint distinct N-rich islands of fertility that foster local feedback between soil N cycling, plant N uptake, and herbaceous community composition. Such patch-scale differences in N inputs and plant-soil interactions increase biogeochemical heterogeneity in grassland-savanna ecosystems and may shape watershed-level responses to chronic N deposition. 3aannuals 3acommunity structure 3aecosystems 3aenvironmental factors 3agrasses 3ahills 3aislands 3amineralization 3anational parks 3anitrates 3anitrification 3anitrogen 3anitrogen content 3asimulation models 3asoil 3asoil water regimes 3asoil-plant interactions 3astable isotopes 3avegetation 3aCalifornia 0aNatural abundance isotopes 0aBlue oak savanna1 aKellogg, Chev H. 0 tPlant ecology.g2007 Aug., v. 191, no. 2 p.209-220dDordrecht : Kluwer Academic Publishersx1385-02377nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11258-006-9238-93Available from publisher's Web site  a20070702b20070802c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02008naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003100092024002200123024001900145040001800164072000900182072000900191100002200200245010200222300001600324500002400340506007600364520047400440506003700914650002000951650001000971650002000981650002501001650003101026650001601057650001601073650001901089653002301108700002001131700002001151700002401171773008301195852000901278856008101287856008701368930003301455945002501488946001301513655001201526IND4448645120221207130905.0110130e201007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444864512DNAL7 a10.4161/psb.5.7.116992doi7 aPMC30145332pmcid7 a205053502pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF500 0aF6001 aAdamczyk, Bartosz10aProteins as nitrogen source for plants: A short story about exudation of proteases by plant roots  ap. 817-819.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aInterest in the problem of plant nitrogen nutrition is increasing.

The experiment was carried out using lysimeters with 15N-labelled urea and N-(n-butyl) thiophosphoric triamide (NBPT) as urease inhibitor and dicyandiamide (DCD) as nitrification inhibitor, comparing three different treatments: urea alone (U), urea + NBPT (UN) and urea + NBPT + DCD (UND). Both volatilization and leaching were significantly different in the soils used, according to their physico-chemical characteristics. However, the pattern of the loss was similar: the volatilization was significantly reduced by NBPT (UN), but the presence of DCD (UND) significantly increased the loss, with respect to UN. Considering leaching, the highest amount of NO(3-) was lost with UND, the lowest with U. The greatest amount of N lost by leaching was soil-derived N produced by the N mineralization-immobilization turnover. We suggest that, by maintaining the NH(4+) in the soils, the inhibitors, in particular DCD, caused a priming effect with a subsequent increase in the rate of soil organic matter mineralization and an extra release of soil organic N. The priming effect was real in the sandy loam (SL) soil where a net N release was observed, whereas in the clay loam (CL) soil the effect of the inhibitors was less pronounced and an apparent priming effect was observed; however, a real priming effect also cannot be excluded in this soil. 3amineralization 3anitrogen 3asoil organic matter 3avolatilization 3adicyandiamide 3aclay loam soils 3aleaching 3aurease inhibitors 3asoil microorganisms 3alosses from soil 3abiological activity in soil 3anitrification inhibitors 3aurea 3adegradation 3asandy loam soils 3aphosphoric triamides 0asoil biology 0aimmobilization 0apriming effect 0an-(n-butyl) thiophosphoric triamide1 aNastri, A.1 aMarzadori, C.1 aGiovannini, C.1 aVittori Antisari, L.1 aGessa, C.0 tBiology and fertility of soils.g2002 Sept., v. 36, no. 2 p.129-135x0178-27627nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00374-002-0521-13Available from publisher's Web site  a20030602b20030603c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle03502naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002500092040001800117100002000135245008600155300001600241500002400257520229900281650001502580650001502595650000902610650001102619650001202630650001602642650002302658650001802681650001302699650001302712650002002725650001302745650001602758650000902774650002202783650001202805650001002817650001502827651002002842700001702862700001802879773008802897852000902985856003802994655001203032IND4459967620221120030248.0110715s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445996762DNAL7 a10.1071/WR102042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLaw, Bradley S.10aDo young eucalypt plantations benefit bats in an intensive agricultural landscape  ap. 173-187.  aIncludes references  aContext Environmental benefits of timber plantations have been a major selling point for land use change from previously cleared farmland, but data concerning the response of biodiversity are scarce. Aims We investigated the use of young (4-11 years old) timber plantations by bats in comparison with other vegetation classes in a highly cleared and productive agricultural landscape in north-west New South Wales (NSW), Australia. Methods Initially, we recorded activity in paddocks before plantation establishment, and then four to six years after establishment. We compared activity within young eucalypt plantations with surrounding paddocks and remnant woodland. We also radio-tracked four different bat species to investigate how roosting and foraging was apportioned into different habitats. Key results The ultrasonic survey of bats found that the young plantations were typically used by 7-8 species and activity averaged 87 passes per night. Activity within plantations was similar to treeless paddocks, and approximately six times less than in small remnants. The very high activity levels and feeding buzzes in small remnants was significantly related to rich, basalt soil (which was used as a proxy for invertebrate biomass) on agricultural plains. Total activity and species richness was correlated positively with the number of remnant trees on the site, but neither plantation area nor shape influenced bat activity. Plantations were not used preferentially by radio-tracked bats at night compared with their availability in the local landscape (13-14% bat use, 17% available). No bat roosts were located within the plantations. Most bat roosts were in tree hollows, which were absent in the plantations. Decorticating bark was abundant in eucalypt plantations, but only Nyctophilus geoffroyi was observed beneath bark and only in remnant trees outside of plantations. Conclusions Young eucalypt plantations have limited value for bats, and this is comparable to previous studies on more environmentally focussed plantings. Implications The value of plantations for bats would be improved by retaining remnant trees, both in the surrounding landscape and within plantations. We also recommend varying tree densities to increase the diversity of animal species using plantations. 3aChiroptera 3aEucalyptus 3abark 3abasalt 3abiomass 3acorrelation 3aecosystem services 3afeeding level 3aforaging 3ahabitats 3aland use change 3apastures 3aplantations 3asoil 3aspecies diversity 3asurveys 3atrees 3avegetation 3aNew South Wales1 aChidel, Mark1 aPenman, Trent0 tWildlife research.g2011, v. 38, no. 3 p.173-187dCSIRO Publishingx1035-37127nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1071/WR10204 7aarticle02910naa a2200637 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001300128245012200141300001800263500001500281520092000296650001301216650001801229650002401247650002101271650003101292650001401323650002401337650002901361650002501390650002501415650001901440650002401459650001801483650002301501650002001524650004401544650003901588650001801627650002201645650001301667650002801680650002101708650001401729650005701743650002601800650004401826650002401870650007401894650003401968653001502002653002002017653002802037653001902065700001402084773009402098852000902192930003302201945001302234946001302247655001202260IND2038209420221117180342.0940325e19940204mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203820942DNAL7 a81063832pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHu, G.Z.10aOverexpression of yeast PAM1 gene permits survival without protein phosphatase 2A and induces a filamentous phenotype  ap. 3429-3435.  a2019-12-05  aProtein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) is an essential enzyme which is present in all eukaryotic cells. PP2A has been implicated in regulating various metabolic processes and also in the control of cell cycle progression. In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the catalytic subunit of PP2A is encoded by two duplicated genes, PPH21 and PPH22. A third related gene, PPH3, also contributes some PP2A activity. We have used a yeast strain in which a single functional PP2A gene is expressed from a regulated promoter to screen for high copy number suppressors of PP2A depletion. A new gene was cloned, PAM1 (PP2A multicopy suppressor), which in high copy number can bypass the need for a PP2A catalytic subunit. The PAM1 gene encodes a hydrophilic 93-kDa protein that contains two coiled coil motifs and has a highly basic C-terminal tail. High level overexpression of PAM1 inhibits growth and induces a filamentous phenotype. 3aproteins 3amessenger RNA 3arestriction mapping 3astructural genes 3aphosphoprotein phosphatase 3aphenotype 3agene overexpression 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3aamino acid sequences 3anucleotide sequences 3afungal anatomy 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aBase Sequence 2aBlotting, Northern 2aGene Expression 2aGene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic 2aGene Expression Regulation, Fungal 2aGenes, Fungal 2aGenes, Suppressor 2aGenotype 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aMultigene Family 2aPhenotype 2aPhosphoprotein Phosphatasesxbiosynthesisxgenetics. 2aProtein Phosphatase 2 2aRNA, Messengerxanalysisxbiosynthesis. 2aRestriction Mapping 2aSaccharomyces cerevisiaexenzymologyxgeneticsxgrowth & development. 2aSequence Homology, Amino Acid 0aregulation 0agene expression 0amolecular sequence data 0agenbank/x734541 aRonne, H.0 tJournal of biological chemistry.g1994 Feb. 4, v. 269, no. 5 p.3429-3435x0021-92587nnas  aDNAL  a20050421b20050501c00000000  aINDdLDP  aOther US 7aarticle01873naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131100002200149245006900171300001600240500002400256520093800280650001001218650001201228650001701240650002201257650001901279650001401298650001101312650000801323700002801331773009001359852000901449856008901458655001201547IND4463966620221117180310.0120824s2003    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446396662DNAL7 a10.1016/S0308-8146(02)00566-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKrejƒçov√°, Anna.14aThe determination of boron in tea and coffee by ICP‚ÄìAES method  ap. 303-308.  aIncludes references  aA method for determination of boron by optical emission spectrometry with inductively coupled plasma has been suggested and sufficient experimental conditions have been found.

The DDR is activated not only by genotoxic agents that induce DNA damage, but also during aberrant cell-division cycles caused by activated oncogenes and inactivated tumor suppressors. Here we use RNAi and cDNA overexpression screens in human cells to identify genes that, when deregulated, lead to activation of the DDR. The RNAi screen identified 73 genes that, when silenced in at least two cell types, cause DDR activation. Silencing several of these genes also caused an increased frequency of micronuclei, a marker of genetically unstable cells. The cDNA screen identified 97 genes that when overexpressed induce DDR activation in the absence of any exogenous genotoxic agent, with an overrepresentation of genes linked to cancer. Secondary RNAi screens identified CDK2-interacting protein (CINP) as a cell-cycle checkpoint protein. CINP interacts with ATR-interacting protein and regulates ATR-dependent signaling, resistance to replication stress, and G2 checkpoint integrity.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDNA damage 3aDNA repair 3aRNA interference 3aapoptosis 3acarcinogenesis 3acell division 3acomplementary DNA 3agene overexpression 3agenotoxicity 3ahumans 3aneoplasms 3aoncogenes1 aXu, Xin1 aBansbach, Carol E.1 aGlick, Gloria G.1 aZhao, Runxiang1 aYe, Fei1 aSirbu, Bianca M.1 aTitus, Laura C.1 aShyr, Yu1 aCortez, David0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2009 Nov. 17, v. 106, no. 46 p.19304-19309dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.09093451063Available from publisher's Web site  a20091120b20091204c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02000naa a2200277 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002200145245008500167300001400252500002400266520115700290650001201447650001701459650001101476650002301487650002201510650001201532773010901544852000901653856004801662655001201710IND4415145620221122230129.0090120e200902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441514562DNAL7 a10.1007/s11273-008-9096-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRobertson, Morgan14aThe work of wetland credit markets: two cases in entrepreneurial wetland banking  ap. 35-51.  aIncludes references  aWetland banking has been discussed in the policy literature mainly at a high level of abstraction, using economic models or generic examples to illustrate the concepts and tensions within wetland banking. This article illustrates two cases of wetland bank creation in-depth using the methodology of the extended case study, following the process from the initiation of interest in forming a bank through to the approval of credits for sale. The close attention to actual cases serves to move discussion beyond the goodness of models or the supposed rationality of economic actors, towards a consideration of actual market participants in complex situations. Successful wetland credit producers must negotiate a number of different economic, political, interpersonal, and ecological forces which impact their project from a number of different scales. While no optimal solution to this complexity is likely to be reached that is generalizable, the use of entrepreneurial wetland banking as a market-based policy may expand where skillful bankers and regulators together arrive at adequate solutions that are matched to the specificity of their contexts. 3abanking 3acase studies 3acredit 3aeconometric models 3aissues and policy 3amarkets0 tWetlands ecology and management.g2009 Feb., v. 17, no. 1 p.35-51dSpringer Netherlandsx0923-48617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11273-008-9096-4 7aarticle02271naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002100110040001800131100002200149245016100171300001600332520074300348650004101091650002601132650001201158650002901170650005401199650003201253650004201285650001001327650002901337650006901366650004401435650002101479650003201500700001901532700001901551700002201570700001601592700001601608700001901624773009001643852000901733930003301742945001301775946001301788655001201801IND2039055320221122230122.0940425e199401  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203905532DNAL7 a81261912pmid7 aPMC2630082pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKnowles, D.P.

A total of 218 goat serum specimens were tested for antic-CAEV antibody by AGID and immunoprecipitation of [35S]methionine-labeled CAEV. In comparison with that of immunoprecipitation, the sensitivity of the CAEV AGID test was 0.91, and that of the OPPV AGID test was 0.56. The AGID test with either antigen was 100% specific. The lower sensitivity of the OPPV AGID test in detecting caprine antibody to CAEV indicates that OPPV antigen is of limited value for use in CAEV diagnosis and control programs. 3aCaprine arthritis encephalitis virus 3aimmunodiffusion tests 2aAnimals 2aAntibodies, Viralxblood 2aArthritis-Encephalitis Virus, Caprineximmunology 2aEvaluation Studies as Topic 2aGoat Diseasesxdiagnosisximmunology. 2aGoats 2aImmunodiffusionxmethods 2aLentivirus Infectionsxbloodxdiagnosisximmunologyxveterinary. 2aLentiviruses, Ovine-Caprineximmunology 2aPrecipitin Tests 2aSensitivity and Specificity1 aEvermann, J.F.1 aShropshire, C.1 aVanderSchalie, J.1 aBradway, D.1 aGezon, H.M.1 aCheevers, W.P.0 tJournal of clinical microbiology.g1994 Jan., v. 32, no. 1 p.243-245x0095-11377nnas  aDNAL  a19940504b19940511c00000000  aINDdCLD  aOther US 7aarticle02852naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127100002600144245013800170300001800308500001500326520123500341650002201576650002301598650001901621650001801640650001501658650002101673650001701694650001801711650001401729650001901743650002801762650001201790650002201802650001901824650001301843653001201856653002201868653001501890653002501905653001601930653001601946700001901962700001501981700001801996700001602014700001602030773007002046852000902116856007802125930003302203945002502236946001302261655001202274IND4410261420221122215326.0080916e200711  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441026142DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

On-the-go soil sensors have been able to provide relatively high mapping density while assessing this variation. A new ion-selective electrode (ISE) based approach was developed and tested for simultaneous mapping of soil pH, residual nitrate (NO‚ÇÉ‚Åª), and soluble potassium (K‚Å∫) contents. In this article, results of laboratory experiments investigating the effects of key measurement factors on ISE performance are presented. In addition to four different soils, these factors included: soil/water ratio (SWR), quality of water used for electrode rinsing (QWR) and for ion extraction (QWE), presence of ionic strength adjuster (ISA), and solution agitation (stirring). After the targeted ion activity presented by different soils, SWR was the second most influential factor causing increased measurement variance, while the influence of QWE was only significant for pH measurements. Based on this study, the following measurement parameters were recommended: agitated purified water extraction without ISA, addition of a fixed amount of water (preferably 1:1 soil/water ratio), and use of regular (tap) water for electrode rinsing. 3ameasuring devices 3asoil water content 3asoil nutrients 3awater quality 3aextraction 3anitrate nitrogen 3asoil surveys 3asoil analysis 3apotassium 3asoil fertility 3aspecific ion electrodes 3asoil pH 3aspatial variation 3aionic strength 3asolvents 0asensors 0aelectrode rinsing 0aelectrodes 0aon-the-go techniques 0amethodology 0anew methods1 aAdamchuk, V.I.1 aMarx, D.B.1 aDobermann, A.1 aMeyer, G.E.1 aJones, D.D.0 tTransactions of the ASABE.g2007 , v. 50, no. 6 p.1927-19357nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.asabe.org/pubs/trans.html3Available from publisher's Web site  a20100712b20100807c00000000  aINDd2CTe2009/01/30  aOther US 7aarticle03767naa a2200625 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100001900171245019000190300001600380520178700396650002302183650001502206650001102221650001702232650001302249650001602262650002002278650001302298650002102311650000702332650001502339650001602354650001602370650001302386650001502399650002502414650003702439650004202476650001802518650003302536650002102569650001702590650003102607650002802638650003102666650001602697653002202713653002202735700001602757700001802773700002202791700002202813700002002835773012902855852000902984856009202993930003303085946001103118655001203129IND4401607120221122215353.0080217e200803  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440160712DNAL7 a179536812pmid7 a10.1111/j.1365-2672.2007.03605.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSubba Rao, Ch.10aModelling and optimization of fermentation factors for enhancement of alkaline protease production by isolated Bacillus circulans using feed-forward neural network and genetic algorithm  ap. 889-898.  aModelling and optimization of fermentation factors and evaluation for enhanced alkaline protease production by Bacillus circulans. A hybrid system of feed-forward neural network (FFNN) and genetic algorithm (GA) was used to optimize the fermentation conditions to enhance the alkaline protease production by B. circulans. Different microbial metabolism regulating fermentation factors (incubation temperature, medium pH, inoculum level, medium volume, carbon and nitrogen sources) were used to construct a '6-13-1' topology of the FFNN for identifying the nonlinear relationship between fermentation factors and enzyme yield. FFNN predicted values were further optimized for alkaline protease production using GA. The overall mean absolute predictive error and the mean square errors were observed to be 0¬∑0048, 27¬∑9, 0¬∑001128 and 22¬∑45 U ml‚Åª¬π for training and testing, respectively. The goodness of the neural network prediction (coefficient of R¬≤) was found to be 0¬∑9993. Four different optimum fermentation conditions revealed maximum enzyme production out of 500 simulated data. Concentration-dependent carbon and nitrogen sources, showed major impact on bacterial metabolism mediated alkaline protease production. Improved enzyme yield could be achieved by this microbial strain in wide nutrient concentration range and each selected factor concentration depends on rest of the factors concentration. The usage of FFNN-GA hybrid methodology has resulted in a significant improvement (>2¬∑5-fold) in the alkaline protease yield. The present study helps to optimize enzyme production and its regulation pattern by combinatorial influence of different fermentation factors. Further, the information obtained in this study signifies its importance during scale-up studies. 3aBacillus circulans 3aalgorithms 3acarbon 3afermentation 3ainoculum 3amethodology 3aneural networks 3anitrogen 3anutrient content 3apH 3aprediction 3aproteinases 3atemperature 3atopology 2aAlgorithms 2aBacillusxmetabolism 2aBacterial Proteinsxbiosynthesis 2aBioreactorsxmicrobiologyxstandards. 2aCulture Media 2aEndopeptidasesxbiosynthesis 2aEnzyme Stability 2aFermentation 2aHydrogen-Ion Concentration 2aIndustrial Microbiology 2aNeural Networks, Computer. 2aTemperature 0aalkaline protease 0agenetic algorithm1 aSathish, T.1 aMahalaxmi, M.1 aSuvarna Laxmi, G.1 aSreenivas Rao, R.1 aPrakasham, R.S.0 tJournal of applied microbiology.g2008 Mar., v. 104, no. 3 p.889-898dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx1364-50727nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2672.2007.03605.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20080218b20080301c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02699naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002100110040001800131100002200149245011600171300001400287520133500301650001301636650002801649650002501677650001801702650002001720650004601740650001101786650002801797650002801825650005401853650004001907700002901947700001801976700001901994700002102013700001402034700002102048700001602069773008802085852000902173930003302182945001302215946001302228655001202241IND2057461820221122185026.0970603e199701  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205746182DNAL7 a89688862pmid7 aPMC2295172pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGussenhoven, G.C.10aLEPTO dipstick, a dipstick assay for detection of Leptospira-specific immunoglobulin M antibodies in human sera  ap. 92-97.  aWe studied a dipstick assay for the detection of Leptospira-specific immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibodies in human serum samples. A high degree of concordance was observed between the results of the dipstick assay and an IgM enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Application of the dipstick assay for the detection of acute leptospirosis enabled the accurate identification, early in the disease, of a high proportion of the cases of leptospirosis. Analysis of a second serum sample is recommended, in order to determine seroconversion or increased staining intensity. All serum samples from the patients who were confirmed to be positive for leptospirosis by either a positive microscopic agglutination test or a positive culture but were found to be negative by the dipstick assay were also judged to be negative by the IgM ELISA or revealed borderline titers by the IgM ELISA. Some cross-reactivity was observed for sera from patients with diseases other than leptospirosis, and this should be taken into account in the interpretation of test results. The dipstick assay is easy to perform, can be performed quickly, and requires no electricity or special equipment, and the assay components, a dipstick and a staining reagent, can be stored for a prolonged period without a loss of reactivity, even at elevated temperatures. 3amedicine 3ahuman health and safety 3abacterial infections 3aanimal health 3aanimal diseases 2aAntibodies, Bacterialxbloodximmunology. 2aHumans 2aImmunoenzyme Techniques 2aImmunoglobulin Mxblood 2aLeptospiraximmunologyxisolation & purification. 2aLeptospirosisxbloodxmicrobiology.1 aHoorn, M.A.W.G. van der.1 aGoris, M.G.A.1 aTerpstra, W.J.1 aHartskeerl, R.A.1 aMol, B.W.1 aIngen, C.W. van.1 aSmits, H.L.0 tJournal of clinical microbiology.g1997 Jan., v. 35, no. 1 p.92-97x0095-11377nnas  aDNAL  a19970703b19970710c00000000  aINDdCD1  aOther US 7aarticle03217naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110100001400127245014100141300001800282500001500300520171600315650002102031650001002052650001902062650001602081650001702097650002502114650001302139650003302152650001502185650002102200650001802221650001402239650001002253650001602263650001602279650002102295653001802316653004302334700001802377700001502395700001702410700001502427700001702442773007002459852000902529856007802538930003302616945002502649946001302674655001202687IND4410269820221122155515.0080916e200711  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441026982DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aTsuta, M.10aThree-Dimensional Visualization of Internal Structural Changes in Soybean Seeds During Germination by Excitation-Emission Matrix Imaging  ap. 2127-2136.  a2019-12-05  aA novel method of three-dimensionally visualizing the internal structure of a soybean seed, which was based on excitation-emission matrix (EEM) measurement and EEM pattern analysis, was developed. Cross-sectional images of three soybean samples at different germination stages were taken at 561 different excitation and emission wavelength conditions so that the EEM at each pixel was calculated. By applying principal component analysis (PCA) to these EEM data, two wavelength condition sets were selected for a simplified EEM measurement. Serial cross-sectional images at various depths of soybean seeds at pre-, early, and late germination stages were taken under the two wavelength condition sets. The difference in the simplified EEM pattern was converted into the difference in color by PCA and the color assignment of each pixel. Then, cross-sectional images were accumulated by a volume rendering method to develop three-dimensionally reconstructed models. Finally, six different three-dimensional reconstructed models of samples at each germination stage under the two wavelength condition sets were developed. Observations of these images suggested that vascular bundles or constituents forming them already existed in soybean seeds at the pre-germination stage. It was also considered that a soybean seed, similar to a cereal seed, has a specific part that emits autofluorescence between the seed coat and the endosperm. In addition, it was supposed that, at the early germination stage of a soybean seed, chlorophyll or related constituents were expressed in the cotyledon on the hypocotyl side, not throughout the seed, and spread along the vascular-bundle-like structure as germination progressed. 3aseed germination 3atesta 3aimage analysis 3aGlycine max 3afluorescence 3adevelopmental stages 3asoybeans 3aprincipal component analysis 3acotyledons 3aseed development 3adata analysis 3aendosperm 3acolor 3ameasurement 3achlorophyll 3avascular bundles 0aplant anatomy 0aexcitation-emission matrix measurement1 aMiyashita, K.1 aSuzuki, T.1 aNakauchi, S.1 aSagara, Y.1 aSugiyama, J.0 tTransactions of the ASABE.g2007 , v. 50, no. 6 p.2127-21367nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.asabe.org/pubs/trans.html3Available from publisher's Web site  a20100712b20100807c00000000  aINDd2CTe2009/01/30  aOther US 7aarticle01939naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110100001700127245010100144300001800245500001500263520073400278650001701012650002501029650001601054650001401070650001801084650001301102650002301115650001301138650002201151650002001173650000701193650002701200653001901227700001301246700001801259773007001277852000901347856007801356930003301434945002501467946001301492655001201505IND4410270020220225000000.0080916e200711  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441027002DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Linear discriminant analysis (LDA) was used to investigate if the E-nose was able to distinguish different picking dates (ripeness states). By means of a multivariate calibration technique (PLS), a relationship was established between E-nose signal response and quality attributes, and correlation coefficients were r = 0.659 to 0.732 for soluble solids content, pH, and compression force. This result implies a reasonable prediction performance. 3aharvest date 3atotal soluble solids 3acalibration 3amandarins 3afruit quality 3afirmness 3atitratable acidity 3aripening 3afruit composition 3aelectronic nose 3apH 3anondestructive methods 0asoluble solids1 aWang, J.1 aPereira, A.G.0 tTransactions of the ASABE.g2007 , v. 50, no. 6 p.2137-21427nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.asabe.org/pubs/trans.html3Available from publisher's Web site  a20100712b20100807c00000000  aINDd2CTe2009/01/30  aOther US 7aarticle01626naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092040001800125100001700143245009900160300001600259520068100275650002200956650001500978650001600993650000901009650001901018650001301037650001601050700001801066773008001084852000901164856008301173939003301256946001101289655001201300IND4461976220221122113557.0111007s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446197622DNAL7 a10.3415/VCOT-10-10-01412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChoate, C.J.10aElbow arthrodesis following a pathological fracture in a dog with bilateral humeral bone cysts  ap. 398-401.  aA 10-month-old Yorkshire Terrier was referred for evaluation of an intermittent right thoracic limb lameness that acutely progressed to non-weight-bearing.

Tubers from eight yam cultivars were blanched at 65 ¬∞C for 20 min and dried at 40 ¬∞C for 5 days to test biochemical, thermal and pasting changes occurring during traditional yam flour processing. Blanching reduced peroxidase activity and drying reduced polyphenoloxidase activity, but total phenol content and the brown index of flour and of amala increased dramatically during the latter operations. The brown index of amala was significantly correlated with the total phenol content of the flour (r=0.84) and the peroxidase activity of the fresh tubers (r=0.75). Amylose content and starch gelatinization enthalpy remained stable. For all cultivars, drying significantly increased the onset gelatinization temperature, suggesting the occurrence of starch annealing. The latter leads to a reduction in swelling power and solubility during pasting, and hence to a lower paste viscosity. 3aDioscorea 3aamylose 3aannealing 3ablanching 3acatechol oxidase 3acolor 3acultivars 3adrying 3aflour 3agelatinization 3agelatinization temperature 3apasting properties 3aperoxidase 3aphenol 3asolubility 3aswelling (materials) 3atexture 3atubers 3aviscosity 3ayams1 aHounhouigan, Joseph1 aMestres, Christian1 aNago, Mathurin0 tFood chemistry.g2003 Aug., v. 82, no. 2 p.257-264dElsevier Sciencex0308-81467nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0308-8146(02)00546-03Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle01702naa a2200277 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092040001800125100001800143245010000161300001600261520083900277650001601116650002001132650001401152650001501166700001501181773008001196852000901276856008301285939003301368946001101401655001201412IND4461973320221122081700.0111007s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446197332DNAL7 a10.3415/VCOT-10-12-01612doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLjungvall, K.10aArthroscopic surgery of the middle carpal joint in trotting Standardbreds: Findings and outcome  ap. 350-353.  aObjectives: To describe the injuries in the middle carpal joint of trotting Standardbred racehorses in relation to future racing and to review the use of synovectomy in clinical cases.

Accordingly, aberrant function of dopamine neurons underlies a wide spectrum of disorders, such as Parkinson's disease (PD), dystonia, and schizophrenia. The distinct functions of the dopamine system are carried out by neuroanatomically discrete subgroups of dopamine neurons, which differ in gene expression, axonal projections, and susceptibility in PD. The developmental underpinnings of this heterogeneity are undefined. We have recently shown that in the embryonic CNS, mDA originate from the midbrain floor plate, a ventral midline structure that is operationally defined by the expression of the molecule Shh. Here, we develop these findings to reveal that in the embryonic midbrain, the spatiotemporally dynamic Shh domain defines multiple progenitor pools. We deduce 3 distinct progenitor pools, medial, intermediate, and lateral, which contribute to different mDA clusters. The earliest progenitors to express Shh, here referred to as the medial pool, contributes neurons to the rostral linear nucleus and mDA of the ventral tegmental area/interfascicular regions, but remarkably, little to the substantia nigra pars compacta. The intermediate Shh+ progenitors give rise to neurons of all dopaminergic nuclei, including the SNpc. The last and lateral pool of Shh+ progenitors generates a cohort that populates the red nucleus, Edinger Westphal nucleus, and supraoculomotor nucleus and cap. Subsequently, these lateral Shh+ progenitors produce mDA. This refined ontogenetic definition will expand understanding of dopamine neuron biology and selective susceptibility, and will impact stem cell-derived therapies and models for PD.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aParkinson disease 3abrain 3adopamine 3agene expression 3amodels 3aneurons 3aontogeny 3aschizophrenia1 aAnderegg, Angela1 aRoy, Anil1 aCampochiaro, Laura1 aYun, Beth1 aKittappa, Raja1 aMcKay, Ronald1 aAwatramani, Rajeshwar0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2009 Nov. 10, v. 106, no. 45 p.19185-19190dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.09042851063Available from publisher's Web site  a20091113b20091204c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03443naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100001200171245010000183300001600283500002400299520155400323650001801877650001101895650002101906650001901927650001601946650001901962650003601981650001202017650003202029650002302061650004502084650003202129650003302161650003302194650003002227650001102257650003202268650002502300650002002325650000902345650002602354650003502380650003302415650005902448650003102507700001402538700001502552700001802567700001502585700001802600700001702618700001402635773011602649852000902765856005502774655001202829IND4420468520221122061059.0090515e200906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442046852DNAL7 a189921022pmid7 a10.1111/j.1439-0531.2007.01013.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKon, Y.10aEffect of Carbohydrates on the Ability of Bull Sperm to Bind to Bovine Oviduct Epithelial Cells  ap. 365-370.  aIncludes references  aIn the present study, we investigated the effect of various carbohydrates on the ability of bovine spermatozoa to bind to the bovine oviduct epithelial cells (OECs). We also examined the fertilization competence and motility of spermatozoa that bind to OECs in the presence of carbohydrates. Frozen-thawed spermatozoa were incubated with OECs, with and without various carbohydrates. The sperms were then divided into two fractions: OEC-binding sperms (B-sperm) and non-OEC binding sperms (NB-sperm). The fertilization rate, ability to bind the zona pellucida, and membrane integrity of the spermatozoa as determined using a hypo-osmotic-swelling test (HOST) were lower in NB-sperm than in the unseparated spermatozoa (control). The motility of the B-sperm was maintained for a longer time than that of the control spermatozoa. The addition of N-acetyl- d-glucosamine (GlcNAc, 5 m m) to the sperm-OEC mixture increased the number of B-sperm. D-mannose (5 m m) and D-fucose (5 m m) had no effect on the number of B-sperm. The motility of B-sperm, which bound to OECs in the presence of GlcNAc, however, was not maintained. When either OECs or the spermatozoa were treated with GlcNAc prior to sperm-OEC co-incubation, only sperm-side treatment enhanced sperm-OEC binding, but B-sperm motility was not maintained. The motility of spermatozoa incubated with GlcNAc was lower than that of controls. These results indicate that GlcNAc enhances sperm binding to OECs, probably via sperm surface modification, but does not promote increased sperm survival. 3acarbohydrates 3acattle 3aepithelial cells 3asperm motility 3aspermatozoa 3azona pellucida 2aAcetylglucosaminexpharmacology 2aAnimals 2aCarbohydratesxpharmacology 2aCattlexphysiology 2aCell Membranexdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aCell Survivalxdrug effects 2aCryopreservationxveterinary 2aEpithelial Cellsxmetabolism 2aFallopian Tubesxcytology 2aFemale 2aFertilizationxdrug effects 2aFucosexpharmacology 2aHot Temperature 2aMale 2aMannosexpharmacology 2aSemen Preservationxveterinary 2aSperm Motilityxdrug effects 2aSpermatozoaxdrug effectsxmetabolismxultrastructure. 2aZona Pellucidaxmetabolism1 aIwata, H.1 aShiono, H.1 aMatsubara, K.1 aKurita, A.1 aSakaguchi, Y.1 aKuwayama, T.1 aMonji, Y.0 tReproduction in domestic animals.g2009 June, v. 44, no. 3 p.365-370dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0936-67687nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1439-0531.2007.01013.x 7aarticle01854naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245007900127300001800206500002400224520082200248650001201070650001301082650001601095650001301111650001601124650001601140650002401156700001801180700001401198700002201212773011501234852000901349856007701358930003301435945001301468946001101481655001201492IND2333306320221122061025.0030703e200212  ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233330632DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHinckley, G.10aOxidative enzymes possess catalytic activity in systems with ionic liquids  ap. 2083-2087.  aIncludes references  aOxidative enzymes, laccase C from Trametes sp. and horseradish and soybean peroxidases, catalyzed oxidation reactions in systems with ionic liquids whose content varied from several volume percent to almost total non-aqueous ionic liquids.

Overlapping fragments of the MAP1 protein were expressed in Escherichia coli and were reacted with sera from sheep infected with either C. ruminantium or Ehrlichia ovina. Two immunogenic regions on the MAP1 protein, designated MAP1-A and MAP1-B, were identified. MAP1-A was reactive with C. ruminantium antisera, E. ovina antisera, and three MAP1-specific monoclonal antibodies, whereas MAP1-B reacted only with C. ruminantium antisera. An indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) based on MAP1-B was further developed and validated with sera from animals experimentally infected with C. ruminantium or several Ehrlichia spp. Antibodies raised in sheep, cattle, and goats against nine isolates of C. ruminantium reacted with MAP1-B. Cross-reactivity with MAP1-B was limited to Ehrlichia canis and Ehrlichia chaffeensis, two rickettsias which do not infect ruminants. Antibodies to Ehrlichia spp. which do infect ruminants (E. bovis, E. ovina, and E. phagocytophila) did not react with MAP1-B. Antibody titers to C. ruminantium in sera from experimentally infected cattle, goats, and sheep were detectable for 50 to 200 days postinfection. Further validation of the recombinant MAP1-B-based ELISA was done with sera obtained from sheep raised in heartwater-free areas in Zimbabwe and from several Caribbean islands. A total of 159 of 169 samples which were considered to be false positive by immunoblotting or indirect ELISA did not react with MAP1-B. In conclusion, recombinant MAP1-B may be a suitable antigen for a sensitive serological test for cowdriosis, with dramatically improved specificity. 3aEhrlichia ruminantium 3aheartwater 3aserodiagnosis 3across reaction 3adiagnostic techniques 3asheep 3acattle 3agoats 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3arecombinant antigens 2aAnimals 2aAntigens, Bacterial 2aBacterial Outer Membrane Proteinsxbloodximmunology. 2aBase Sequence 2aCattle 2aDNA Primers 2aEhrlichia ruminantiumximmunologyxisolation & purification. 2aEnzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay 2aHeartwater Diseasexblood 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aRecombinant Proteinsximmunology 2aSerologic Tests 3aZimbabwe 3aCaribbean1 aZeijst, B.A.M. van der.1 aCamus, E.1 aMahan, S.M.1 aMartinez, D.1 aJongejan, F.0 tJournal of clinical microbiology.g1995 Sept., v. 33, no. 9 p.2405-2410x0095-11377nnas  aDNAL  a19961202b19961205c00000000  aINDdCLD  aOther US 7aarticle03118naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001300152245009200165300001600257520167300273650002501946650001201971650002001983650001402003650002202017650002002039650001202059650001102071650001502082650002402097650001502121650002202136650002302158650002102181650002102202650002302223650001202246651001202258653002202270653001602292700001302308700001502321700002502336773010502361852000902466856009302475930003302568946001102601655001202612IND4390925420221122042142.0070506e200705  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439092542DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1574-0862.2007.00213.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBoys, K.14aThe economic impact of cowpea research in Senegal: an ex-post analysis with disadoption  ap. 363-375.  aThis study evaluates the impact of a long-term research collaboration between the Senegalese Institute for Agriculture Research (ISRA), and the Bean/Cowpea Collaborative Research Support Program (CRSP) funded by the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID). Adoption of the primary outputs from this collaboration, a nonchemical cowpea storage method and two short-season cowpea varieties, were tracked through a series of farmer interviews in 1996, 1997, and 2004 in the main cowpea growing area of Senegal. Combined with information from an impact assessment in the late 1980s, this study draws on ex-post adoption data from most of the product life cycle for the storage technology. The 2004 survey found that 60.4% of cowpea production in the main cowpea growing area of Senegal is stored in metal drums and that 69% of households use this storage technology; ISRA/CRSP improved short season varieties were determined to account for 3.6% of cowpea production. Baseline economic analysis of the most recent survey data, which includes benefits and costs of the storage technology and improved varieties, reveal an IRR to donor funding of 13%. The benefits of these technologies appear to be evenly distributed in the rural population on the basis of gender and ethnic background. Comparison of the rates of technology adoption over time, however, reveals that use of the storage technology may be decreasing; inclusion of this technology disadoption trend reduces the IRR by only 0.4% from the baseline estimate. Overall, estimated returns reveal that this collaboration has been a good investment for the U.S. and Senegalese governments, and other donors. 3acooperative research 3acowpeas 3acrop production 3acultivars 3aeconomic analysis 3aeconomic impact 3afarmers 3agender 3ahouseholds 3ainnovation adoption 3ainterviews 3along term effects 3aproduct life cycle 3aresearch support 3arural population 3astorage technology 3asurveys 3aSenegal 0aImpact Assessment 0aDisadoption1 aFaye, M.1 aFulton, J.1 aLowenberg-DeBoer, J.0 tAgricultural economics.g2007 May, v. 36, no. 3 p.363-375dBlackwell Publishing Incx0169-51507nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1574-0862.2007.00213.x3Available from publisher's Web site.  a20070507b20070602c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02760naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127100001300144245009400157300001600251500001500267520133700282650001301619650003001632650001801662650001401680650001301694650002501707650001701732650001701749650002301766650002601789650001801815650001101833650001001844650001301854650001401867653002401881653001201905653002801917653002401945653002501969653002201994773006802016852000902084856007802093930003302171945002502204946001302229655001202242IND4410517520221122005044.0080922e200803  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441051752DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

The average length, width, and thickness were 6.90 mm, 11.65 mm, and 5.39 mm, respectively, at 11.36% d.b. moisture content. The arithmetic and geometric mean diameters increased 7.01% and 7.67%, respectively, while t he sphericity increased 3.07% in the moisture range from 11.36% to 24.53% d.b. Studies on rewetted sira bean grains showed that the thousand-grain mass increased 26.04%, the projected area 26.51%, the true density 10.54%, the porosity from 29.60% to 44.50%, and the terminal velocity 20.96%, while the bulk density decreased from 700.5 to 610.5 kg m -3 with an increase in the moisture content range of 11.36% to 24.53% d.b. The static coefficient of friction of sira bean grains increased linearly for six struct ural materials, namely, rubber (21.05%), aluminum (19.02%), stainless steel (18.03%), galvanized iron (27.59%), glass (22.38%), and MDF (medium-density fiberboard) (25.08%) as the moisture content increased from 11.36% to 24.53% d.b.

These traditional models overestimated the total phosphorus concentration in these lakes by, on average, a factor of two. Data from the eight lakes were therefore used to calibrate emission specific models based on the Vollenweider and Dillon-Rigler structures. With this approach, it was possible to improve the accuracy of the models and to eliminate systematic errors. The new models gave r2 values ranging between 0.90 and 0.92. It was not possible to detect any differences in phosphorus-chlorophyll relationships between lakes with or without fish farm emissions. Neither were there any significant differences between measurements in farm lakes and results obtained from phosphorus-chlorophyll models found in the scientific literature. In the future, however, data from more lakes will be needed to further test the new models and to investigate other effect parameters, e.g. phytoplankton biomass and hypolimnetic oxygen concentrations. 3aemissions 3aphosphorus 3aenvironmental impact 3alakes 3aeutrophication 3aestimation 3achlorophyll 3aphytoplankton 3abiomass 3aoxygen 3aEurope1 aNordvarg, L.0 tAquaculture.g2002 Sept. 23, , no. 1/4 p.191-211dElsevier Pub.

To this end we first have to identify the production frontier and relative efficiency level for each animal-oriented farm in the sample. The production frontier and efficiency index for each type of farm (assuming no specific production functions) are identified using Data Envelope Analysis (DEA) techniques. We then address the relationship between relative efficiency, farm size, and environmentally friendly behavior by carrying out a nonparametric regression of efficiency, on economic size, a proxy for the degree of environmental appropriateness, and regional dummies. Calculations of the efficiency of the farms including direct subsidies are compared with the counterfactual exercise in the case in which direct subsidies are not considered. Finally, we look for relations between subsidies and factors such as farm size, efficiency, and environmentally friendly behavior. One key result shows that, on average direct payments generally tend to increase efficiency. However, in most of the cases the mean efficiency decreases as the percentage of direct payments rises. Direct payments are found to be positively related to environmentally friendly production, at least in Germany. However, in general, the direct payment system is not sufficient to offset the fact that the less environmentally friendly farms as well as the larger farms are more efficient. 3aanimal adaptation 3aanimals 3afarm size 3afarming systems 3afarms 3aproduction functions 3asubsidies 3aGermany 0aEfficiency 0aDEA 0aNonparametric regression 0aEnvironmental friendly farming1 aMurillo, Carmen1 aSan Juan Mesonada, Carlos.1 aSperlich, Stefan0 tAgricultural economics.g2007 Jan., v. 36, no. 1 p.49-65dBlackwell Publishing Incx0169-51507nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1574-0862.2007.00176.x3electronic resource  a20070128b20070202c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03758naa a2200649 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002400164245015000188300001600338520143400354650002101788650001501809650002501824650001301849650001401862650002301876650001001899650001501909650002101924650001301945650002501958650003901983650001202022650002602034650005302060650008302113650004202196650002802238650002102266650002502287650008002312650008002392650004802472650002702520653003702547653001002584653003602594653002602630653003802656700001902694700002402713700002302737700002102760700002302781700003402804773012002838852000902958856008502967930003303052946001103085655001203096IND4408054020221121233721.0080718e200808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440805402DNAL7 a185064222pmid7 a10.1007/s00203-008-0386-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKrejƒç√≠k, Zdenƒïk 10aSulfoacetate released during the assimilation of taurine-nitrogen by Neptuniibacter caesariensis: purification of sulfoacetaldehyde dehydrogenase  ap. 159-168.  aTaurine (2-aminoethanesulfonate) is a widespread natural product whose nitrogen moiety was recently shown to be assimilated by bacteria, usually with excretion of an organosulfonate via undefined novel pathways; other data involve transcriptional regulator TauR in taurine metabolism. A screen of genome sequences for TauR with the BLAST algorithm allowed the hypothesis that the marine gammaproteobacterium Neptuniibacter caesariensis MED92 would inducibly assimilate taurine-nitrogen and excrete sulfoacetate. The pathway involved an ABC transporter (TauABC), taurine:pyruvate aminotransferase (Tpa), a novel sulfoacetaldehyde dehydrogenase (SafD) and exporter(s) of sulfoacetate (SafE) (DUF81). Ten candidate genes in two clusters involved three sets of paralogues (for TauR, Tpa and SafE). Inducible Tpa and SafD were detected in cell extracts. SafD was purified 600-fold to homogeneity in two steps. The monomer had a molecular mass of 50 kDa (SDS-PAGE); data from gel filtration chromatography indicated a tetrameric native protein. SafD was specific for sulfoacetaldehyde with a K m-value of 0.12 mM. The N-terminal amino acid sequence of SafD confirmed the identity of the safD gene. The eight pathway genes were transcribed inducibly, which indicated expression of the whole hypothetical pathway. We presume that this pathway is one source of sulfoacetate in nature, where this compound is dissimilated by many bacteria. 3aABC transporters 3aalgorithms 3aamino acid sequences 3abacteria 3aexcretion 3agel chromatography 3agenes 3ametabolism 3amolecular weight 3anitrogen 3anucleotide sequences 3apolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 3ataurine 3atranscription factors 2aAcetaldehydexanalogs & derivativesxmetabolism. 2aBacterial Proteinsxchemistryxgeneticsxisolation & purificationxmetabolism. 2aGene Expression Regulation, Bacterial 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aMolecular Weight 2aNitrogenxmetabolism 2aOceanospirillaceaexenzymologyxgeneticsxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aOxidoreductasesxchemistryxgeneticsxisolation & purificationxmetabolism. 2aTaurinexanalogs & derivativesxmetabolism. 2aTranscription, Genetic 0aAssimilation of taurine-nitrogen 0aDUF81 0aSulfoacetaldehyde dehydrogenase 0aSulfoacetate exporter 0aTaurine:pyruvate aminotransferase1 aDenger, Karin 1 aWeinitschke, Sonja 1 aHollemeyer, Klaus 1 aPaƒçes, V√°clav.1 aCook, Alasdair M. 1 aSmits, T.

  1 aPliestiƒá, Stjepan.10aTechnical Note: Influence of Moisture Content on Physical and Mechanical Properties of Almond (Prunus dulcis cv. Fra Giulio Grande)  ap. 653-659.  a2019-12-05  aVarious physical and mechanical properties of almond ( Prunus dulcis cv. 'Fra Giulio Grande') nuts and kernels were determined at four moisture content levels (9.74%, 16.35%, 23.28%, and 30.46% wet basis). The average length, width, thickness, equivalent diameter, unit mass, volume, and sphericity of nuts were 36.77 mm, 26.70 mm, 19.01 mm, 26.51 mm, 6.06 g, 9.83 cm 3 , and 72.13%, respectively, while the corresponding values for kernels were 25.98 mm, 16.19 mm, 8.63 mm, 15.33 mm, 1.57 g, 1.93 cm 3 , and 59.01%, respectively, at a moisture content of 9.74% wet basis (w.b.). In the moisture range from 9.74% to 30.46% w.b., studies on the rewetted nut showed that the bulk density of nut and kernel decreased from 488 to 401 kg m -3 and from 559 to 475 kg m -3 , respectively. The true density of nut decreased from 826 to 730 kg m -3 , while for kernel it decreased from 922 to 844 kg m -3 . The porosity of nut increased from 40.94% to 45.08%, while porosity of kernel increased from 39.43% to 43.69%. The projected area for nut and kernel increased from 745 to 823 mm 2 and from 318 to 357 mm 2 , respectively. In the same moisture range, the static coefficient of friction for nuts on three different material surfaces varied from 0.291 to 0.415 on aluminum, from 0.338 to 0.462 on plywood, and from 0.392 to 0.529 on rubber. The corresponding values for kernels were 0.335 to 0.441, 0.381 to 0.496, and 0.484 to 0.589, respectively. The maximum force for nut cracking occurred in the longitudinal direction and the minimum force transversely in thickness direction. For all compression directions, the force required to crack the nut decreased with increasing moisture content. The results of this study could be applied to optimize and develop of machines for handling and cracking of this almond cultivar. 3acultivars 3adiameter 3athickness 3avolume 3aporosity 3abulk density 3amechanical properties 3asurfaces 3awater content 3afriction 3alength 3aalmonds 3ashelling 3ashape 3aPrunus dulcis 3awidth 0aphysical properties 0acoefficient of friction 0adensity1 aDobricevic, Nadica1 aFilipovic, Dubravko1 aGospodaric, Zlatko0 tTransactions of the ASABE.g2008 , v. 51, no. 2 p.653-6597nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.asabe.org/pubs/trans.html3Available from publisher's Web site  a20090225b20090301c00000000  aINDd2CTe2009/02/02  aOther US 7aarticle02096naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002100110040001800131100001800149245012900167300001800296500001500314520034200329650002300671650002700694650002300721650001300744650002200757650001400779650003200793650001200825650002800837650002600865650001100891650002300902650004600925650001500971650002400986650008401010650008401094651001101178651001101189651002401200651001101224653001701235700001601252700001501268700001801283700001501301700001401316700001701330773009101347852000901438930003301447945001301480946001301493655001201506IND2041238820221121102217.0940803e199405  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204123882DNAL7 a79142102pmid7 aPMC2637182pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFukushima, H.10aRestriction endonuclease analysis of virulence plasmids for molecular epidemiology of Yersinia pseudotuberculosis infections  ap. 1410-1413.  a2019-12-05  aRestriction endonuclease analysis of virulence plasmid DNA was used to study the epidemiology of Yersinia pseudotuberculosis infections.

A large family of RAS-related small GTPases, Rabs or Ypts, is known to regulate both anterograde and retrograde trafficking of transport vesicles between different endomembrane compartments and the plasma membrane in mammalian and yeast cells. Studies on the functional roles of analogous plant proteins are emerging. We report here that a tobacco pollen-predominant Rab2, NtRab2, functions in the secretory pathway between the endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi in elongating pollen tubes. Green fluorescent protein-NtRab2 fusion protein localized to the Golgi bodies in elongating pollen tubes. Dominant-negative mutations in NtRab2 proteins inhibited their Golgi localization, blocked the delivery of Golgi-resident as well as plasmalemma and secreted proteins to their normal locations, and inhibited pollen tube growth. On the other hand, when green fluorescent protein-NtRab2 was over-expressed in transiently transformed leaf protoplasts and epidermal cells, in which NtRab2 mRNA have not been observed to accumulate to detectable levels, these proteins did not target efficiently to Golgi bodies. Together, these observations indicate that NtRab2 is important for trafficking between the endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi bodies in pollen tubes and may be specialized to optimally support the high secretory demands in these tip growth cells.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aNicotiana tabacum 3aendoplasmic reticulum 3aGolgi apparatus 3apollen tubes 3aactive transport 3areporter genes 3aanimal proteins 3agreen fluorescent protein 2aBiological Transport 2aEndoplasmic Reticulumxmetabolism 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plant 2aGolgi Apparatusxmetabolism 2aGreen Fluorescent Proteins 2aLuminescent Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aMicroscopy, Electron 2aMutation 2aPlant Leavesxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aPlants, Genetically Modified 2aPollenxgeneticsxgrowth & developmentxultrastructure. 2aRecombinant Fusion Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aTobaccoxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2arab2 GTP-Binding Proteinxgeneticsxphysiology.1 aChen, C.Y.H.1 aGlaven, R.H.1 ade Graaf, B.H.J.1 aVidali, L.1 aHepler, P.K.1 aWu, H.M.0 tplant cell.g2002 Apr., v. 14, no. 4 p.945-962dAmerican Society of Plant Physiologistsx1040-46517nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.plantcell.org/3electronic resource  a20030903b20030905c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle03311naa a2200697 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111072001700129072001700146072001700163072001700180100001300197245016800210300001600378500001500394520122000409650001801629650002201647650002101669650001801690650002501708650001501733650002501748650002201773650001601795650002501811650003701836650003001873650003101903650002101934650002401955650001201979650001801991650002902009650002202038650002702060650003102087650001702118650004602135650001002181650002802191650002002219653001602239653001102255653002802266653002802294653003102322700001802353700001602371700001402387700002202401773010002423852000902523930003302532945002502565946001102590655001202601IND4373075920221121065506.0050805e200509  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437307592DNAL7 a159789972pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Both genes are expressed exclusively in the midguts of adult female mosquitoes and their expression is strongly induced by blood feeding. Ae-Aper50 has a predicted secretory signal peptide and five chitin-binding domains with intervening mucin-like domains. Localization of Ae-Aper50 to the peritrophic matrix was demonstrated by immuno-electron microscopy. Recombinant Ae-Aper50 expressed in baculovirus-infected insect cells binds chitin in vitro. Site-directed mutagenesis was used to study the role that cysteine residues from a single chitin-binding domain play in the binding to a chitin substrate. Most of the cysteine residues proved to be critical for binding. AEG12 has a putative secretory signal peptide at the amino-terminus and a putative glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor signal at its carboxyl-terminus and the protein was localized by immuno-electron microscopy to the midgut epithelial cell microvilli. 3amessenger RNA 3acomplementary DNA 3aepithelial cells 3aAedes aegypti 3aperitrophic membrane 3amicrovilli 3aamino acid sequences 3amembrane proteins 3ahematophagy 3anucleotide sequences 3astructure-activity relationships 3asite-directed mutagenesis 3agene expression regulation 2aAedesxchemistry 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAnimals 2aBase Sequence 2aCell Membranexchemistry 2aChitinxchemistry 2aGastrointestinal Tract 2aGene Expression Regulation 2aGene Library 2aInsect Proteinsxbiosynthesisxchemistry. 2aLarva 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aProtein Binding 0aperitrophin 0amidgut 0achitin-binding proteins 0amolecular sequence data 0aprotein immunolocalization1 aDevenport, M.1 aFujioka, H.1 aGhosh, A.1 aJacobs-Lorena, M.0 tInsect biochemistry and molecular biology.g2005 Sept., v. 35, no. 9 p.947-959x0965-17487nnas  aDNAL  a20080603b20080704c00000000  aINDdNZMe2005/08/18  aNon-US 7aarticle01694naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245008000126300001600206500001500222520079300237650001601030650001201046650002701058650002601085650001301111650001601124653002001140700001801160773012401178852000901302930003301311945001301344946001101357655001201368IND2205556720221121044114.0000630s1999    enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220555672DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPavlova, K.10aProduction and properties of exopolysaccharide by Rhodotorula acheniorum MC  ap. 473-477.  a2019-12-05  aProduction of exopolysaccharide by Rhodotorula acheniorum MC was studied. Polysaccharide synthesis, biomass concentration, sugar consumption, pH value, dynamic viscosity and NH4(+) concentration were studied in batch fermentation under aeration 0.75 vvm and agitation 500 rpm. In a medium containing 50 g/litre sucrose the maximum amount of exopolysaccharide 6.2 g/litre and 10.2 g/litre biomass were obtained at 96 h. The chemical composition of the polysaccharide was carbohydrate--98.2%, protein--1.2%, ash--0.4%, monosaccharide: mannose--92.8% and glucose--7.2%. The interaction between the polysaccharide synthesized by Rh. acheniorum MC polymer and xanthan showed synergistic effect. The viscosity of a mannan-xanthan (20:80) mixture was 40% higher as compared to the xanthan alone. 3aRhodotorula 3amannans 3arheological properties 3abiological production 3amixtures 3axanthan gum 0apolysaccharides1 aGrigorova, D.0 tFood research international.g1999, v. 32, no. 7 p.473-477aFood research international (Ottawa, Ont.)x0963-99697nnas  aDNAL  a20000902b20000912c00000000  aINDdLDP  aNon-US 7aarticle03239naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001900145245011700164300001600281520166700297650002101964650002601985650002202011650002102033650002102054650002602075650001302101650002002114650003802134650002902172650001002201650001102211650002502222650001802247650002202265650001102287650001202298651001002310653001402320653001702334653001802351700001502369700002002384700001502404700001502419773013702434852000902571856008502580930003302665946001102698655001202709IND4400214720221121043949.0080120e200802  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440021472DNAL7 a10.1007/s11274-007-9458-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDang, Hongyue 10aDominant chloramphenicol-resistant bacteria and resistance genes in coastal marine waters of Jiaozhou Bay, China  ap. 209-217.  aStudies of abundance, diversity and distribution of antibiotic-resistant bacteria and their resistance determinants are necessary for effective prevention and control of antibiotic resistance and its dissemination, critically important for public health and environment management. In order to gain an understanding of the persistence of resistance in the absence of a specific antibiotic selective pressure, microbiological surveys were carried out to investigate chloramphenicol-resistant bacteria and the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase resistance genes in Jiaozhou Bay after chloramphenicol was banned since 1999 in China. About 0.15-6.70% cultivable bacteria were chloramphenicol resistant, and the highest abundances occurred mainly in the areas near river mouths or sewage processing plants. For the dominant resistant isolates, 14 genera and 25 species were identified, mostly being indigenous estuarine or marine bacteria. Antibiotic-resistant potential human or marine animal pathogens, such as Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis and Shewanella algae, were also identified. For the molecular resistance determinants, the cat I and cat III genes could be detected in some of the resistant strains, and they might have the same origins as those from clinical strains as determined via gene sequence analysis. Further investigation about the biological, environmental and anthropogenic mechanisms and their interactions that may contribute to the persistence of antibiotic-resistance in coastal marine waters in the absence of specific antibiotic selective pressure is necessary for tackling this complicated environmental issue. 3aEscherichia coli 3aKlebsiella pneumoniae 3aProteus mirabilis 3aShewanella algae 3aanimal pathogens 3aantibiotic resistance 3abacteria 3achloramphenicol 3achloramphenicol acetyltransferase 3aenvironmental management 3agenes 3ahumans 3anucleotide sequences 3apublic health 3asequence analysis 3asewage 3asurveys 3aChina 0acat genes 0aJiaozhou Bay 0aMultiplex PCR1 aRen, Jing 1 aSong, Linsheng 1 aSun, Song 1 aAn, Liguo 0 tWorld journal of microbiology & biotechnology.g2008 Feb., v. 24, no. 2 p.209-217dDordrecht : Springer Netherlandsx0959-39937nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11274-007-9458-83Available from publisher's Web site  a20080120b20080202c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02557naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002600145245014900171300001600320500002400336520134900360650001901709650001301728650002301741650000901764650001501773650001001788650002601798650002601824650000701850650001701857650001001874650001401884650002001898650001601918650001701934650001001951700002401961773009301985852000902078856004802087655001202135IND4430150420221121044029.0091218e201001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443015042DNAL7 a10.1007/s00271-009-0164-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIntrigliolo, Diego S.10aResponse of grapevine cv. ‚ÄòTempranillo' to timing and amount of irrigation: water relations, vine growth, yield and berry and wine composition  ap. 113-125.  aIncludes references  aThe effects of several moderate irrigation regimes on vine water status, yield, and must and wine composition, were investigated during five seasons in a vineyard planted with Vitis vinifera cv. Tempranillo. Treatments consisted of non-irrigated vines and six differentially irrigated treatments with contrasting watering regimes during the pre-veraison and post-veraison periods. There were large differences in yield and grape and wine quality responses to irrigation among seasons, probably as consequence of the different environmental conditions and crop levels. It was, however, clear that vines benefit more of the irrigation supplied in years of high yield levels. Across seasons, yield increased in proportion to the amount of water applied mostly due to the larger berries of irrigated vines, and there was no clear response to the timing of irrigation supplied. In addition, there were no carry over effects due to irrigation on bud fertility. The post-veraison water application was necessary to increase must sugar level and wine alcohol content. However, water restrictions during the pre-veraison period lead to more concentrated berries in terms of total phenolic and anthocyanins. The only noticeable detrimental effect of irrigation, regardless of the timing of its application, on wine composition was an increase in wine pH. 3aVitis vinifera 3aalcohols 3aapplication timing 3abuds 3acrop yield 3acrops 3aenvironmental factors 3airrigation scheduling 3apH 3asmall fruits 3avines 3avineyards 3awater treatment 3awine grapes 3awine quality 3awines1 aCastel, Juan Ram√≥n0 tIrrigation science.g2010 Jan., v. 28, no. 2 p.113-125dSpringer-Verlagx0342-71887nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00271-009-0164-1 7aarticle02684naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001400110245011400124300001300238500002400251500001500275520152600290650001901816650001001835650002401845650001401869650001801883650001301901650001801914650001101932650001601943653000901959653001101968700001601979700001501995700001302010773009402023852000902117856007902126930003302205945001302238946001102251655001202262IND2333333020221121044015.0030707e200209  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233333302DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRoy, J.C.10aConvective and ventilation transfers in greenhouses. 1. The greenhouse considered as a perfectly stirred tank  ap. 1-20.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aIn this paper, the characterization and modelling of the most relevant convective transfers contributing to the elaboration of the greenhouse climate are reviewed. Convective transfers include heat and mass transfers between air and solid surfaces (walls, roof, leaves) along with air, heat, water vapour and tracer gas transfers to or from the inside air. Adopting the assumption that the greenhouse is a perfectly stirred tank, the specific characterization methods associated with this approach are reviewed. The perfectly stirred tank approach requires the assumption of uniform temperature, humidity and CO2 content inside the greenhouse and uses a 'big leaf' model to treat the plant canopy and describe the exchanges of latent and sensible heat with inside air. The simulation of the ventilation processes associated with this simplified approach is based on the Bernoulli equation and on the experimental determination of semi-empirical parameters by means of air exchange rate measurements. The techniques used to measure temperature and air exchange rates measurements pertaining to the whole greenhouse volume are presented. A complete panorama of the studies in relation to the transfer coefficients between the different surfaces together with the ventilation performances of various greenhouse types are also presented. This paper is the first part of a review of the convective transfers in greenhouses and in the second paper, a similar study based on the approach of the distributed climate is presented. 3acarbon dioxide 3agases 3amathematical models 3aequations 3amass transfer 3aair flow 3aheat transfer 3aleaves 3agreenhouses 0aheat 0aplants1 aBoulard, T.1 aKittas, C.1 aWang, S.0 tBiosystems engineering.g2002 Sept., v. 83, no. 1 p.1-20dAcademic Pressx1537-51107nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.sciencedirect.com/science/journal/153751103electronic resource  a20050410b20050501c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle03516naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002800164245015100192300001400343500002400357520185900381650001002240650001202250650003002262650003502292650003402327650001402361650001202375650004902387650002502436650002902461650001602490650003302506650006302539650009102602650006402693651001302757651001302770700003402783700002202817700002302839773012702862852000902989856004802998655001203046IND4399215620221121033537.0071223e200801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439921562DNAL7 a177863732pmid7 a10.1007/s00244-007-9006-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLoganathan, Bommanna G.10aPolychlorinated Dibenzo-p-Dioxins, Dibenzofurans, and Dioxin-Like Polychlorinated Biphenyls in Sediment and Mussel Samples from Kentucky Lake, USA  ap. 20-30.  aIncludes references  aSediment and mussel tissues from the Kentucky Dam Tailwater (KDTW) and Ledbetter Embayment (LE) of Kentucky Lake, Kentucky, USA, were analyzed to examine the presence of 2,3,7,8-substituted polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs), polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDFs), and non-, mono-, and di-ortho-chlorine-substituted polychlorinated biphenyls. Concentrations of target compounds varied with locations and sample matrices. In general, KDTW sediment samples contained slightly higher amounts of PCDD/DFs (average: 1100, range: 120-2400) than the LE sediments (average: 920, range: 580-1300) on a pg/g dry wt (dw) basis. Dioxin-like PCBs in KDTW were (average: 550, range: 70-2,000) higher than in LE (average: 320, range: 44-1000) on a ng/g dw basis. In contrast, mussel tissues had greater concentrations of PCDD/DFs in LE (average: 6500, range: 2200-13,000) than in KDTW (average: 3500, range: 2500-4800). Dioxin-like PCBs were slightly higher in KDTW (average: 76, range: 18-100) than in LE (average: 49, range: 24-96) on a ng/g fat wt basis. Biota sediment accumulation factors (BSAFs) were calculated using tissue concentrations and sediment concentrations based on dry weight. PCDD/DFs BSAF was in the range of 0.21-25 in LE and 0.093-13 in KDTW. 1,2,3,7,8,9-HxCDF in LE and 2,3,7,8-TCDF in KDTW had a greater BSAF, while BSAF for dioxin-like PCBs ranged from 0.84 to 13 in LE and from 2.3 to 12 in KDTW in which PCB-169 had the greatest BSAF in LE and PCB-167 in KDTW. Toxic equivalency (TEQ) was greatest in mussel from LE (mean: 193 pgTEQ/g fat wt) followed by mussel from KDTW (32 pgTEQ/g fat wt), sediment in KDTW (13 pgTEQ/g dry wt), and sediment in LE (7.6 pgTEQ/g dry wt).

In this study, suppression subtractive hybridization was used to identify the genes present in Fibrobacter succinogenes S85 but absent from F. intestinalis DR7. A total of 1,082 subtractive clones were picked, plasmids were purified, and inserts were sequenced, and the clones lacking homology to F. intestinalis were confirmed by Southern hybridization. By comparison of the sequences of the clones to one another and to those of the F. succinogenes genome, 802 sequences or 955 putative genes, comprising approximately 409 kb of F. succinogenes genomic DNA, were identified that lack similarity to those of F. intestinalis chromosomal DNA. The functional groups of genes, including those involved in cell envelope structure and function, energy metabolism, and transport and binding, had the largest number of genes specific to F. succinogenes. Low-stringency Southern hybridization showed that at least 37 glycoside hydrolases are shared by both species. A cluster of genes responsible for heme, porphyrin, and cobalamin biosynthesis in F. succinogenes S85 was either missing from or not functional in F. intestinalis DR7, which explains the requirement of vitamin B‚ÇÅ‚ÇÇ for the growth of the F. intestinalis species. Two gene clusters encoding NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase subunits probably shared by Fibrobacter genera appear to have an important role in energy metabolism.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aFibrobacter intestinalis 3aFibrobacter succinogenes 3aNADH dehydrogenase (ubiquinone) 3aSouthern blotting 3abiosynthesis 3acecum 3acell structures 3aclones 3aenergy metabolism 3aheme 3ahydrolases 3amultigene family 3aplasmids 3arumen 3aruminants 3asequence analysis 3asuppression subtractive hybridization 3avitamin B121 aNelson, K.E.1 aDaugherty, S.C.1 aNelson, W.C.1 aHance, I.R.1 aMorrison, M.1 aForsberg, C.W.0 tApplied and environmental microbiology.g2008 Feb. 15, v. 74, no. 4 p.987-993dAmerican Society for Microbiologyx0099-22407nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1128/AEM.02514-073Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle01378naa a2200301 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100001600115245005600131300001400187500001500201520056900216650002400785650001600809650002300825650002300848650001500871653001700886653002000903773007800923852000901001939003301010945000801043946001301051655001201064991609759300742620221121025325.0791019e197901  xx ||||go|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI794558492DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEure, Thad.10aNRA: If we're doing so well why are we under attack  ap. 53-54.  a2019-12-04  aThe President of the National Restaurant Association comments on foodservice issues for 1979.

In a previous report (Covarrubias, M., and Rubin, E. (1993) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 90, 6957-6960), we found that low concentrations of ethanol (17-170 mM) selectively inhibited a noninactivating cloned K+ channel encoded by Drosophila Shaw2. Here, we have conducted equilibrium dose-inhibition experiments, single channel recording, and mutagenesis in vitro to study the mechanism underlying the inhibition of Shaw2 K+ channels by a homologous series of n-alkanols (ethanol to 1-hexanol). The results showed that: (i) these alcohols inhibited Shaw2 whole-cell currents, the equilibrium dose-inhibition relations were hyperbolic, and competition experiments revealed the presence of a discrete site of action, possibly a hydrophobic pocket; (ii) this pocket may be part of the protein because n-alkanol sensitivity can be transferred to novel hybrid R+ channels composed of Shaw2 subunits and homologous ethanol-insensitive subunits; (iii) moreover, a hydrophobic point mutation within a cytoplasmic loop of an ethanol-insensitive K+ channel (human Kv3.4) was sufficient to allow significant inhibition by n-alkanols, with a dose-inhibition relation that closely resembled that of wildtype Shaw2 channels; and (iv) 1-butanol selectively inhibited long duration single channel openings in a manner consistent with a direct effect on channel gating. These results strongly suggest that a discrete site within the ion channel protein is the primary locus of alcohol and general anesthetic action. 3aanesthesia 3aDrosophila melanogaster 3aion transport 3amembrane proteins 3apotassium 3aelectric current 3amutants 3aplasma membrane 3aethanol 3amembrane potential 2aAlcoholsxpharmacology 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAnesthesia, General 2aAnesthetics, Generalxpharmacology 2aAnimals 2aCloning, Molecular 2aDelayed Rectifier Potassium Channels 2aDrosophilaxgenetics 2aDrug Interactions 2aHumans 2aIon Channel Gatingxdrug effects 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPotassium Channel Blockers 2aPotassium Channelsxgenetics 2aPotassium Channels, Voltage-Gated 2aXenopus 0ainhibition 0arelationships 0aelectrophysiology 0an-alkanols 0aalcohols1 aVyas, T.B.1 aEscobar, L.1 aWei, A.0 tJournal of biological chemistry.g1995 Aug. 18, v. 270, no. 33 p.19408-19416x0021-92587nnas  aDNAL  a19970602b19970606c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle02050naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002400152245005800176300001600234520093100250650002601181650001601207650003501223650002501258650001101283650001601294653001601310653001601326653001901342653001501361653002701376653002201403773010501425852000901530856009301539930003301632946001101665655001201676IND4390924420221121013025.0070506e200705  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439092442DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1574-0862.2007.00210.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStarbird, S.

Errors in testing, however, can mislead buyers and lead to problems such as adverse selection. The ability to segregate suppliers who can deliver safe food from suppliers who cannot depends on the accuracy of the test procedure. In this article we examine the effect of test sensitivity, specificity, and sampling error on the ability to segregate safe and unsafe suppliers. We find that there is a maximum level of error below which unsafe suppliers are deterred from accepting a utility maximizing buyer's bid price. The maximum error depends on the probability that a supplier's production is unsafe and the cost of producing an unsafe lot, among other things. Understanding this relationship makes it possible to design contracts and government regulations that discourage unsafe suppliers from trading. 3adiagnostic techniques 3afood safety 3agenetically modified organisms 3alaws and regulations 3aprices 3aprobability 0aSensitivity 0aSpecificity 0aSampling error 0aInspection 0aAsymmetric information 0aAdverse selection0 tAgricultural economics.g2007 May, v. 36, no. 3 p.325-334dBlackwell Publishing Incx0169-51507nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1574-0862.2007.00210.x3Available from publisher's Web site.  a20070507b20070602c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02646naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245014800127300001500275500002400290520156700314650001101881650001901892650002001911650002301931650002301954650001001977650001701987650001602004700001402020773012602034852000902160856007002169930003302239945001302272946001102285655001202296IND2333312320221121013246.0030703e20020923ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233331232DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGall, G.A.E.10aApplication of mixed-model techniques to fish breed improvement: analysis of breeding-value selection to increase 98-day body weight in tilapia  ap. 93-113.  aIncludes references  aA post-selection analysis of a three-generation selection experiment was undertaken to assess the effectiveness of using estimated breeding values as the selection criterion for the improvement of body weight at 98 days of age. Two replicate selection lines and a control line were derived from a common base population. Fixed effects of generation, line, sex and tank, as well as the fixed-effect interaction of the generation with line, sex and tank, were the significant factors determining performance. The estimated heritability of the 98-day weight was 0.20 +/- 0.04, while the maternal direct-genetic and full-sib group effects as a proportion of phenotypic variance were 0.02 +/- 0.02 and 0.09 +/- 0.02, respectively. Although phenotypic means varied from generation to generation, the genetic gains calculated from the estimated breeding values were 2.61 +/- 0.05 and 2.42 +/- 0.37 g per generation for the replicate lines, which is equivalent to a 40% improvement in just three generations. Additionally, although the randomly selected control line showed a linear increase in performance of 4.10 +/- 1.27 g per generation, the change in the average breeding value was only 0.27 +/- 0.01 g per generation, indicating that the increase in performance was due to improved management and/or adaptation to the culture environment. The post-selection analysis clearly demonstrated the superiority of the mixed-model approach to selection, with the potential of increasing the selection response by 20-30% above the value expected from simple mass selection. 3abreeds 3abreeding value 3aanimal breeding 3aselection criteria 3agender differences 3atanks 3aheritability 3abody weight1 aBakar, Y.0 tAquaculture.g2002 Sept. 23, , no. 1/4 p.93-113dElsevier Pub.

In the first experiment, survival rates of larvae fed on Artemia nauplii, cladocereans (Moina sp.), or red-blood worms (Tubifex) were not significantly different, 91-93%. However, Artemia nauplii and Tubifex gave similar growth rates (35-36% day(-1)) while Moina sp. resulted in lower growth. Commercial trout-starter feed resulted in the lowest survival (67%) and growth rates (20% day(-1)) when compared to live feed. In the second experiment, feeding dry feed based on yeast and beef liver or feeding decapsulated Artemia cysts improved survival rates. These were 90% and 87%, respectively, not significantly different from Artemia nauplii. Regarding growth, dry feed and decapsulated Artemia cysts resulted in lower growth rates than Artemia nauplii. These were 23% and 29%, respectively. Stomach content analysis showed that reduced growth in decapsulated-cyst fed larvae compared to live Artemia reflected a difference in feed ingestion and preference rather than a difference in nutritional quality of the feed. In the third experiment, it was shown that larvae require 3-day feeding on Artemia nauplii before weaning them on to trout-starter feed to prevent negative effects on growth. Three days after initial feeding, fish stomach attains its biological and physiological functions. 3aSiluridae 3alarvae 3afeeds 3aweaning 3amortality 3aArtemia 3aTubifex 3afish feeding 3afeed intake 3anutritive value1 aNguyen, Anh Tuan.1 aCacot, P.1 aLazard, J.0 tAquaculture.g2002 Sept. 23, , no. 1/4 p.115-127dElsevier Pub.

The ELISA was performed on 308 serum samples; 198 from a pool of healthy individuals, 42 from patients who had antibodies against a variety of parasites other than T. solium, and 68 from patients suspected of having cysticercosis. All of these 68 specimens were tested both by the ELISA and by an immunoblot method (enzyme-linked immunoelectrotransfer blot assay [EITB]) developed at the Parasitic Serology Laboratory of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Twenty-seven of the 68 serum samples from patients suspected of having cysticercosis were positive by both EITB and ELISA, while 31 were negative by both assays. ELISA results for three and two samples were considered false positive and false negative, respectively, when compared with the results of EITB. Results for an additional five samples were considered equivocal but were technically positive because their optical density readings were slightly above the cutoff value. Three of the 198 serum samples from the bank of serum samples from healthy individuals were also false positive by ELISA (the EITB result for the samples was negative). Six other serum samples from healthy individuals which had equivocal results and the five serum samples from patients with equivocal results were EITB negative. Serum samples containing antibodies against Echinococcus spp. frequently cross-reacted with the cysticercus ELISA antigen (13 of 16 specimens), but serum samples with antibodies against other parasites did not (2 of 26 specimens); all of these serum samples were EITB negative. The commercially available ELISA that we describe is a simple and rapid test. Considering all 308 specimens, the ELISA had a specificity of 93% (when samples with equivocal results were considered negative) or 89% (when samples with equivocal results were considered positive); the sensitivity was 93%. 3ahelminths 2aAnimals 2aAntibodies, Helminthxblood 2aAntigens, Helminth 2aCross Reactions 2aCysticercosisxdiagnosisximmunology. 2aCysticercusximmunology 2aEchinococcusximmunology 2aEnzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assayxmethods 2aEvaluation Studies as Topic 2aFalse Negative Reactions 2aFalse Positive Reactions 2aHumans 2aImmunoblotting 2aSerologic Testsxmethods 0aanimal parasites and pests 0aanimal health1 aSchneider, S.1 aRosenblatt, J.0 tJournal of clinical microbiology.g1995 Dec., v. 33, no. 12 p.3124-3128x0095-11377nnas  aDNAL  a19970401b19970408c00000000  aINDdCD1  aOther US 7aarticle02905naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002600110245007800136300001600214500002400230500001500254520170700269650002301976650002401999650001002023650002502033650002002058650002102078650001302099650001802112650001402130650002502144650001902169653002002188700002502208773012602233852000902359856007002368930003302438945001302471946001102484655001202495IND2333309820221120192335.0030703e20020731ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233330982DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCordova-Murueta, J.H.10aNutritive value of squid and hydrolyzed protein supplement in shrimp feed  ap. 371-384.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThough some protein sources like squid and protein hydrolysates are assumed as growth enhancers for shrimp, little is known about the biochemical basis of this phenomenon. Low, heat-dried squid (Dosidicus gigas) (SQ) and two commercial protein hydrolysates from fish (FH) and krill (Euphasia sp.) (KH) were assayed in feeding trials with Penaeus vannamei. Feeds were prepared with the tested proteins at 3%, 9%, and 15% of the total crude protein. A total of nine experimental feeds plus a commercial one as control (C32) were tried. Additionally, digestibility in vivo and in vitro was evaluated. Survival was not different among groups. Weight gain of shrimp and total and specific proteolytic activity for trypsin and chymotrypsin were affected by type and quantity of supplemented protein. In vivo and in vitro digestibilities were also influenced by the source and quantity of the protein supplement. Shrimp fed feed with FH at 3% protein supplementation grew more than those fed with higher supplementations. Groups fed SQ had similar results as those fed FH, and gained more weight when fed the lowest SQ quantity. SDS-PAGE showed a large concentration of small peptides in SQ, which may explain results similar to FH. KH enhanced shrimp growth at all supplementations and had a lower degree of hydrolysis (DH) than FH. SQ also demonstrated good growth performance, but better at the lower supplementation, probably because of the presence of small peptides and possibly free amino acids from protein hydrolyzed by endogenous enzymes in the squid mantle. We conclude that hydrolyzed protein is a good supplement for shrimp feeds, but it must meet specific requirements for adequate assimilation. 3adigestible protein 3aprotein supplements 3afeeds 3aLitopenaeus vannamei 3aprotein sources 3afree amino acids 3apeptides 3acrude protein 3amortality 3aprotein hydrolysates 3ashrimp culture 0anutritive value1 aGarcia-Carreno, F.L.0 tAquaculture.g2002 July 31, , no. 1/4 p.371-384dElsevier Pub.

The biofilm growth model was based on a discrete model with autonomous agents and was developed using NetLogo, a cross-platform agent-based parallel modeling and simulation environment. Rules were applied to individual bacteria agents to successfully produce a variety of 2-D biofilm growth patterns. By altering reproduction and nutrient diffusion factors to create reproduction and/or diffusion limited conditions, where reproduction is an intrinsic factor and diffusion is an extrinsic factor, different resultant biofilm structures were observed. Under both diffusion and reproduction limited conditions, mushroom shapes were observed; if the conditions were neither diffusion nor reproduction limited, circular shapes were observed, with a blending of these shapes under either diffusion or reproduction limited conditions. Since both factors affected the biofilm structure, these results suggests that a combination of intrinsic and extrinsic factors and not either alone, produces the different growth patterns observed in biofilms. These results are consistent with images obtained using confocal microscopy of E. coli grown on a glass substrate and stained with propidium iodide and SYTO-16. Identification of the relationships between these factors has the potential to improve the modeling of biofilms and predicting the impact of biofilms on processes as diverse as biotechnology, water treatment, and food safety. 3asimulation models 3abiofilm 3aconfocal laser scanning microscopy 3anutrient availability 3amicrobial growth 3acell proliferation 3apopulation dynamics 3aEscherichia coli 0amathematical models 0aconfocal scanning laser microscopy1 aTawney, I.B.1 aGaneshan, P.0 tTransactions of the ASABE.g2007 , v. 50, no. 6 p.2355-23607nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.asabe.org/pubs/trans.html3Available from publisher's Web site  a20100712b20100807c00000000  aINDd2CTe2009/01/30  aOther US 7aarticle02304naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001300110245015000123300001200273500002400285520126100309650001701570650002501587650002101612650002001633650001501653650001501668650001401683700001101697773012201708852000901830856007001839930003301909945001301942946001101955655001201966IND2333083220221120181511.0030617e20030327ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233308322DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJian, J.10aEffects of traditional Chinese medicine on nonspecific immunity and disease resistance of large yellow croaker, Pseudosciaena crocea (Richardson)  ap. 1-9.  aIncludes references  aThe influence of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) formulated from Astragalus Root (Radix astragalin seu Hedysari) and Chinese Angelica Root (Radix angelicae sinensis) at the rate of 5:1 (w/w) on nonspecific immunity including the number of phagocytes, lysozyme and complement activities, and disease resistance to Vibrio alginolyticus in large yellow croaker, Pseudosciaena crocea (Richardson) was determined. Minced fish (surimi) supplemented with 0.5% TCM had no influence on the nonspecific immunity of the fish (P > 0.05). On the other hand, the surimi with 1.0% and 1.5% TCM resulted in a significant increase in nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT) positive cells and lysozyme activities (P < 0.05) of experimented fish on 20, 25 and 30 days after feeding and led to evident enhancement of complement activities (P < 0.05) after 15 days of feeding. The highest survival rates (93.3%) in fish infected with V. alginolyticus were achieved with surimi containing 1.0% and 1.5% TCM, but the cumulative mortalities were 37% and 75% in fish fed with surimi containing 0.5% TCM and TCM-free surimi, respectively. These results indicated that the TCM formula might elevate the function of nonspecific immunity and enhance disease resistance of large yellow croaker. 3afish culture 3atraditional medicine 3aherbal medicines 3aimmune response 3aphagocytes 3acomplement 3amortality1 aWu, Z.0 tAquaculture.g2003 Mar. 27, , no. 1/4 p.1-9dElsevier Pub.

However, since the magnitude of grain stocks held for this purpose as well as the costs of physical storage have become prohibitively high, there is now a need for finding cost-effective alternatives including non-interventionist and market-oriented methods for price stabilization. In this paper we consider the case of rice and wheat which are staple foodgrains in India. We make a comparison between alternative price stabilization policies including that of holding buffer stocks in terms of their impact on domestic price stability, producer and consumer welfare and government costs. A multi-market equilibrium framework is used where private storage, consumption, supply and prices of rice and wheat are determined simultaneously. Indian exports and imports are assumed to affect world prices. The alternative price stabilizing mechanisms are ranked according to both the criteria, welfare and price stability achieved. The main findings are as follows. The ranking of alternatives varies with the criterion used. Greater price stability need not necessarily imply greater welfare. The option of variable levies on private external trade turns out to be the most inexpensive and that of domestic buffer stocks the costliest in achieving price stability. Further, the efficacy of buffer stocks and subsidy to private storage in stabilizing prices is lower under free trade as compared to the case where the economy is closed to private external trade. 3afood grains 3afood policy 3astorage 3arice 3awheat 3ainternational trade 3aeconometric models 3acost effectiveness 3aIndia 0afree trade 0adomestic markets 0abuffer stocks 0aprice stabilization 0aprivate storage1 aSrinivasan, P.V.0 tAgricultural economics.g1999 Aug., v. 21, no. 1 p.93-108aAgricultural economics (Amsterdam, Netherlands)x0169-51507nnas  aDNAL  a20000501b20000508c00000000  aINDdTBT  aNon-US 7aarticle02971naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127072001700144100001500161245009700176300001800273500001500291520160800306650001301914650002401927650001901951650001101970650002501981650002002006650002602026650001502052650001002067650001602077650001002093650001302103650001102116651001102127653002702138653002202165700001902187700001802206700001302224773007002237852000902307856007802316930003302394945002502427946001302452655001202465IND4410276520221120181625.0080916e200711  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441027652DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aSafren, O.10aDetection of Green Apples in Hyperspectral Images of Apple-Tree Foliage Using Machine Vision  ap. 2303-2313.  a2019-12-05  aIt is important for orchard owners to be able to estimate the quantity of fruit on the trees at the various growth stages, because a tree that bears too many fruits will yield small fruits. Thus, if growers are interested in controlling the fruit size, knowing in advance that there are too many developing fruits will give them the opportunity to treat the tree. This study proposes a machine vision-based method of automating the yield estimation of apples on trees at different stages of their growth. Since one of the most difficult aspects of apple yield estimation is distinguishing between green varieties of apples or those that are green in the first stages of growth, and the green leaves that surround them, this investigation concentrates on estimating the yield of green varieties of apples. Hyperspectral imaging was used, because it is capable of giving a wealth of information both in the visible and the near-infrared (NIR) regions and thus offers the potential to provide useful results. A multistage algorithm was developed that uses several techniques, such as principle components analysis (PCA) and extraction and classification of homogenous objects (ECHO) for analyzing hyperspectral data, as well as machine vision techniques such as morphological operations, watershed, and blob analysis. The method developed was tested on images taken in a Golden Delicious apple orchard in the Golan Heights, Israel, in two sessions: one during the first stages of growth, and the second just before harvest. The overall correct detection rate was 88.1%, with an overall error rate of 14.1%. 3aorchards 3aautomatic detection 3aimage analysis 3aapples 3adevelopmental stages 3aMalus domestica 3ahyperspectral imagery 3acrop yield 3acolor 3afruit crops 3ashape 3aaccuracy 3aleaves 3aIsrael 0afruits (plant anatomy) 0aspectral analysis1 aAlchanatis, V.1 aOstrovsky, V.1 aLevi, O.0 tTransactions of the ASABE.g2007 , v. 50, no. 6 p.2303-23137nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.asabe.org/pubs/trans.html3Available from publisher's Web site  a20100712b20100807c00000000  aINDd2CTe2009/01/30  aOther US 7aarticle01088naa a2200205 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002400075040001800099245003000117300001400147520056600161650001200727653001100739773007000750852000900820939003300829945000800862655001200870991609750670742620221120154826.0770301e197608  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aCAIN7794410082DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL10aProfitable brunch entrees  ap. 27-28.  aRecipes are provided for several brunch selections.

Classical edema disease has not previously been described in Denmark, but between February 1994 and November 1995 cases appeared in 51 pig herds, among which direct or indirect trading contacts were confirmed for 36 of the herds. A total of 213 isolates from pigs with edema disease in Denmark and other countries and 23 E. coli O139 isolates from pigs with diarrhea or healthy pigs were analyzed to characterize their O serogroups, HindIII ribotypes, and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) types, and 183 of the isolates were also analyzed for their plasmid profiles. The resulting PFGE types of the isolates from pigs with edema disease were examined by cluster analysis. Ten isolates from three herds could not be typed with the available O antisera, whereas all other isolates were of serotype O139. However, all isolates from pigs with edema disease belonged to the same HindIII ribotype, which was not observed among the isolates from pigs with diarrhea or healthy pigs. All isolates from Danish pigs with edema disease except for three isolates originating from two herds belonged to the same or closely related XbaI PFGE types; the other three isolates were assigned to possibly related types. Isolates from pigs with edema disease in different countries belonged to different PFGE types. All isolates from Danish pigs with edema disease grouped together in one cluster, in contrast to isolates from other countries, which did not form any clusters. E. coli strains of serogroup O139 from pigs with diarrhea or isolated from the feces of healthy Danish pigs were very different. Plasmid profiles differed largely among isolates. However, among the isolates from Danish pigs with edema disease, one type predominated within herds. The present study indicated that most, if not all, of the observed cases of edema disease in Denmark were part of the same outbreak. The combination of PFGE typing and ribotyping was useful for studying the possible clonal relationship among strains, whereas plasmid profiling was less informative. 3abacterial infections 3aanimal health 3aanimal diseases 2aAnimals 2aBacterial Typing Techniques 2aEdema Disease of Swinexmicrobiology 2aEscherichia colixclassificationxgeneticsxisolation & purification. 2aSwine 0aDenmark1 aJorsal, S.E.1 aAhrens, P.1 aJensen, N.E.1 aMeyling, A.0 tJournal of clinical microbiology.g1997 Jan., v. 35, no. 1 p.20-24x0095-11377nnas  aDNAL  a19970703b19970710c00000000  aINDdCD1  aOther US 7aarticle03843naa a2200673 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100002300171245013100194300001400325500002400339520167100363650001402034650001202048650002002060650001402080650002102094650001202115650001302127650001502140650002202155650002002177650001102197650001602208650000902224650002202233650001102255650001402266650006402280650003402344650006602378650003302444650003002477650004902507650001102556650002002567650000902587650004202596650002602638650001502664650006702679650005102746650005502797650004002852651001502892651001202907651001302919651001702932651001802949700001902967773010702986852000903093856005503102655001203157IND4431102920221120172858.0100111s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443110292DNAL7 a201052642pmid7 a10.1111/j.1748-0361.2009.00261.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBasu, Ja·∫èa≈õrƒ´.10aImpact of Local Resources on Hospitalization Patterns of Medicare Beneficiaries and Propensity to Travel Outside Local Markets  ap. 20-29.  aIncludes references  aPurpose: To examine how local health care resources impact travel patterns of patients age 65 and older across the rural urban continuum. Methods: Information on inpatient hospital discharges was drawn from complete 2004 hospital discharge files from the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP) State Inpatient Databases (SID) for New York, California, and Florida, and the 2003 hospital discharge file for Pennsylvania. The study population was Medicare patients with admissions for ambulatory care sensitive conditions. Analysis was at the patient-level, and area contextual variables were developed at the Primary Care Service Area (PCSA) level. Local resources considered included inpatient supply, provider supply, supply of international medical graduates, and critical access hospitals (CAHs) in the patient's PCSA. Findings: Findings generally confirmed enhanced retention of the elderly in local markets with greater availability of community resources, although we observed considerable heterogeneity across states. Community resource variables such as median household income or inpatient hospital capacity were stronger and more consistent predictors along the urban rural continuum than any of the provider or CAH variables. Only in California and New York did we see significant effects for provider supply or CAH, but they were robust across the 2 states and models of travel propensity, always reducing the travel propensity. Conclusions: Findings support policies aimed at augmenting supplies of critical access hospitals in rural communities, and increasing primary care physicians and hospital resources in both rural and urban communities. 3adatabases 3aelderly 3ahealth services 3ahospitals 3ahousehold income 3amarkets 3apatients 3aphysicians 3arural communities 3arural hospitals 3atravel 2aAge Factors 2aAged 2aAged, 80 and over 2aFemale 2aGeography 2aHealth Resourcesxstatistics & numerical dataxutilization. 2aHealth Services Accessibility 2aHealth Services Needs and Demandxstatistics & numerical data 2aHealth Services for the Aged 2aHealth Status Disparities 2aHospitalizationxstatistics & numerical data 2aHumans 2aLogistic Models 2aMale 2aMedicarexstatistics & numerical data 2aMultivariate Analysis 2aOdds Ratio 2aPatient Acceptance of Health Carexstatistics & numerical data 2aPatient Dischargexstatistics & numerical data 2aRural Health Servicesxstatistics & numerical data 2aTravelxstatistics & numerical data 3aCalifornia 3aFlorida 3aNew York 3aPennsylvania 0aUnited States1 aMobley, Lee R.0 tJournal of rural health.g2010 Winter, v. 26, no. 1 p.20-29dBlackwell Publishing Incx0890-765X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1748-0361.2009.00261.x 7aarticle03146naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002100110245007700131300001400208520219100222650000902413650000902422650002502431650001102456650001402467651000902481653001602490653002202506653001102528653001502539653001602554653002102570773012702591852000902718930003302727945001302760946001102773655001202784IND2202675220221120154742.0000222e199908  ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220267522DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRutherford, A.S.10aMeat and milk self-sufficiency in Asia: forecast trends and implications  ap. 21-39.  aRecent structural changes in dietary patterns in Asia resulting from economic development are placing increasing pressure on the existing production systems in the region-particularly those systems producing ruminant meat, non-ruminant meat and milk. This has significant policy implications for the countries in the region in terms of self-sufficiency goals in these commodities and the associated inter- and intra-regional trade opportunities in the future. Forecasts of ruminant meat, non-ruminant meat and milk production and consumption for selected Asian countries between the years 2000 and 2010 revealed the following: China, Pakistan and Viet Nam are likely to be self-sufficient with respect to ruminant meat; Malaysia is likely to continue to be a net importer of ruminant meat; India and Malaysia will be more than self-sufficient with respect to non-ruminant meat with the converse being true for Pakistan; and India, Laos and Pakistan will be self-sufficient with respect to milk production with the possibility of Indonesia, Thailand and Cambodia becoming self-sufficient if the current trends continue. Structural changes in the early 1980s generally resulted in higher average annual growth rates of production-particularly in non-ruminant meat production. Thus forecasts of ruminant meat production and consumption by 2000 using the medium-term average annual growth rates for production present a more favourable outcome in terms of self-sufficiency for countries such as Bangladesh, the Philippines and Viet Nam but a less favourable outcome for countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, Laos and India. Similar forecasts for non-ruminant meat indicated an improvement in the long-term non-ruminant self-sufficiency estimates for most case-particularly for Bangladesh, China and Cambodia. Intensification and commercialisation of meat production systems have increased meat self-sufficiency in a number of countries but often at the expense of grain self-sufficiency. Given these trends, the impact of trade liberalisation measures on livestock production in the region and inter- and intra-regional trade of livestock commodities and grain is likely to be significant. 3ameat 3amilk 3aeconomic development 3aprices 3aequations 3aAsia 0aforecasting 0astructural change 0atrends 0aproduction 0aconsumption 0aself sufficiency0 tAgricultural economics.g1999 Aug., v. 21, no. 1 p.21-39aAgricultural economics (Amsterdam, Netherlands)x0169-51507nnas  aDNAL  a20000501b20000508c00000000  aINDdTBT  aNon-US 7aarticle02871naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001500110245008800125300001600213500002400229520166600253650001301919650001101932650002101943650001601964650002701980650002102007650002702028650000902055650002402064650001102088650001102099650002402110650001202134650001602146650001602162651001802178651001002196700001402206700001602220700001302236773009202249852000902341856007502350655001202425IND4463817820221120154917.0120808s2003    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446381782DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRejani, R.10aHydrologic and Hydrogeologic Analyses in a Coastal Groundwater Basin, Orissa, India  ap. 177-186.  aIncludes references  aThe Balasore coastal groundwater basin in Orissa, India is under a serious threat to groundwater quantity and quality. Overdraft has resulted in declining groundwater levels and seawater intrusion. The present article focuses on the pertinent hydrologic and hydrogeologic analyses of the basin. Streamflow analysis of two rivers indicated that streamflow reaches its peak in July-August and reduces to a minimum in April-May. The runoff from the basin is estimated at 16.0 x 10 6 , 160.7 x 10 6 , and 525.8 x 10 6 m 3 for dry, normal, and wet years, respectively. The safe yield of the Balasore basin has been determined to be 155.3 x 10 6 m 3 . For normal year and dry years, the gross annual irrigation requirements for the existing cropping pattern are 32 and 178% greater than the safe yield of the aquifer, respectively, while the current groundwater withdrawal for irrigation is 71% more than the safe yield. The regression analysis of monthly rainfall, river stage, and the corresponding groundwater level for the period 1997-1999 revealed that though river seepage and rainfall are two major sources of recharge to the basin, the first source is more significant. The stratigraphic analysis indicated that the basin mainly comprises three confined aquifers. The overall flow of groundwater in the first aquifer is from north to south into the Bay of Bengal. The second aquifer is severely contaminated by seawater intrusion within a 4- to5- km wide tract along the coastline, leaving groundwater unfit for drinking and irrigation purposes. It is concluded that some urgent measures must be taken to ensure sustainable groundwater resources in the basin. 3aaquifers 3acoasts 3acropping systems 3agroundwater 3agroundwater extraction 3agroundwater flow 3airrigation requirement 3arain 3aregression analysis 3arivers 3arunoff 3asaltwater intrusion 3aseepage 3astream flow 3awater table 3aBay of Bengal 3aIndia1 aJha, M.K.1 aPanda, S.N.1 aMull, R.0 tApplied engineering in agriculture.g2003 Mar., v. 19, no. 2 p.177-186x0883-85427nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://elibrary.asabe.org/toc.asp3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02923naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094024002200132024001900154040001800173100002600191245007900217300001600296506007600312520132400388592002801712506003701740650002301777650002201800650000801822650002001830650001101850650001001861650002001871650003101891650002001922650001601942650001501958650003701973650004202010650002902052650002102081700002102102700002702123700003302150700002302183700002402206773009402230856008402324852000902408655001202417IND60113839720221207113214.0141112e201207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011383972DNAL7 a10.1016/j.molimm.2012.03.0342doi7 aPMC33585312pmcid7 a225343142pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVanderven, Hillary A.10aAvian influenza rapidly induces antiviral genes in duck lung and intestine  ap. 316-324.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aDucks are the natural reservoir of influenza A and survive infection by most strains. To characterize the duck immune response to influenza, we sought to identify innate immune genes expressed early in an infection. We used suppressive subtractive hybridization (SSH) to construct 3 libraries enriched in differentially expressed genes from lung RNA of a duck infected with highly pathogenic avian influenza virus A/Vietnam/1203/04 (H5N1), or lung and intestine RNA of a duck infected with low pathogenic avian influenza A/mallard/BC/500/05 (H5N2) compared to a mock-infected duck. Sequencing of 1687 clones identified a transcription profile enriched in genes involved in antiviral defense and other cellular processes. Major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC I), interferon induced protein with tricopeptide repeats 5 (IFIT5), and 2‚Ä≤-5‚Ä≤ oligoadenylate synthetase-like gene (OASL) were increased more than 1000-fold in relative transcript abundance in duck lung at 1dpi with highly pathogenic VN1203. These genes were induced much less in lung or intestine following infection with low pathogenic BC500. The expression of these genes following infection suggests that ducks initiate an immediate and robust response to a potentially lethal influenza strain, and a minimal response to a low pathogenic strain.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAnas platyrhynchos 3aInfluenza A virus 3aRNA 3aavian influenza 3aclones 3aducks 3agene expression 3agene expression regulation 3aimmune response 3ainterferons 3aintestines 3amajor histocompatibility complex 3asuppression subtractive hybridization 3atranscription (genetics) 3avirulent strains1 aPetkau, Kristina1 aRyan-Jean, Kieran E.E.1 aAldridge, Jerry R., Jr.cJr.1 aWebster, Robert G.1 aMagor, Katharine E.0 tMolecular immunology.g2012 July, v. 51, no. 3-4 p.316-324dElsevier Ltdx0161-58907nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.molimm.2012.03.0343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02197naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100003100151245012700182300001300309520095400322592002801276650001901304650002101323650002701344650002701371650002901398650001701427650001401444650001001458650001701468700002401485700002001509700001901529700002301548700001601571773012901587856008601716852000901802655001201811IND50066850720221122193429.0190408e201309  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006685072DNAL7 a10.1016/j.idairyj.2013.03.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDemers-Mathieu, V√©ronique10aInhibition of Listeria monocytogenes growth in Cheddar cheese by¬†an¬†anionic peptides-enriched extract from whey proteins  ap. 6-12.  aThe efficacy of an anionic peptides-enriched extract (APEE), produced by nanofiltration of a tryptic hydrolysate from whey proteins, to inhibit the growth of Listeria innocua and Listeria monocytogenes in reconstituted Cheddar cheese was studied. The antimicrobial activity of APEE in reconstituted cheese was greater against L.¬†monocytogenes than L.¬†innocua and was higher in storage at 30¬†¬∞C than at 4¬†¬∞C. The combination of 20¬†mg¬†g‚àí1 of APEE and 1.75% salt/moisture (S/M) in cheeses incubated for 7 days at 30¬†¬∞C was the most efficient condition to inhibit the growth of Listeria.

In most of the ATRP processes, alkyl halides are used as an initiator. We report the synthesis of three possible potential initiators, N-phenyl(3-bromo-3-methyl)succinimide, N-phenyl(3-bromo-4-methyl)succinimide, and N-phenyl(3-bromomethyl)succinimide for ATRP of N-phenylitaconimide (PI) and methyl methacrylate (MMA). These functionalized alkyl halides, having structural similarity with PI, were characterized by FTIR, HRMS, ¬πH, ¬π¬≥C NMR spectroscopy, and elemental analysis. The equilibrium constants for the ATRP activation/deactivation process (KATRP) of these alkyl halides as well as a commercial ATRP initiator (ethyl-Œ±-bromoisobutyrate) were determined using UV-Vis-NIR and DOSY NMR spectroscopy. Alternatively, these compounds and similar alkyl halides (R-X) were investigated using density functional theory for their possible chain initiation activity for the ATRP process. The B3LYP functional and 6-31+G(d)/LanL2DZ basis set was used for the prediction of geometries and energetics associated with the homolytic R‚ÄìX bond dissociation. The relative value of KATRP and its variation with system parameters (such as substituent, temperature, and solvent) was investigated. We found a good agreement between the experimentally determined and theoretically calculated KATRP values. Our experiments show that the newly synthesized initiator N-phenyl(3-bromo-3-methyl)succinimide performs better than the commercially available initiator ethyl-Œ±-bromoisobutyrate for the atom transfer radical copolymerization of PI and MMA.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3acarbon 3achemical bonding 3acopolymerization 3adensity functional theory 3adissociation 3ageometry 3ahomolytic cleavage 3amass spectrometry 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aorganic halogen compounds 3apolymers 3aprediction 3asolvents 3astable isotopes 3atemperature1 aBaby, C.1 aNadkarni, Vishnu S.1 aBehera, Raghu Nath1 aChauhan, Rashmi0 tRSC advances.g2014 Oct. 02, v. 4, no. 89 p.48163-48176dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c4ra08981b3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02393naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002400143245008800167300001600255520108700271592002801358650002001386650002201406650001501428650001301443650001501456650002701471650000901498650001301507650000901520650001301529650002301542650002501565653002401590653003001614653002401644653002401668653002901692700002201721773012801743856007901871852000901950655001201959IND60480746220221118105540.0160706e20080101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6048074622DNAL7 a10.3138/jvme.35.4.4962doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSherman, Barbara L.10aTraining Veterinary Students in Animal Behavior to Preserve the Human‚ÄìAnimal Bond  ap. 496-502.  aKnowledge of animal behavior is an extremely important component of modern veterinary practice. Appreciation of species-typical behavior helps to ensure that veterinary patients are handled safely and humanely, and plays a pivotal role in the diagnosis of health and welfare problems in animals, including the recognition of pain and distress. Veterinary students who acquire a good understanding of animal behavior will be better clinicians and will be best able to promote and repair the ‚Äúhuman‚Äìanimal bond,‚Äù that important connection between people and their pets. Animal behavior problems can negatively impact this critical relationship, leading to abandonment, re-homing, relinquishment to an animal shelter, and sometimes premature euthanasia of the animal. Therefore, identifying, preventing, and treating behavior problems is important in maintaining the human‚Äìanimal bond. Education in animal behavior should be an essential part of the veterinary curriculum; a board-certified veterinary behaviorist should be an integral member of the veterinary college faculty.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal behavior 3abehavior problems 3acurriculum 3adistress 3aeuthanasia 3ahuman-animal relations 3apain 3apatients 3apets 3astudents 3aveterinary clinics 3aveterinary education 0ahuman‚Äìanimal bond 0aanimal behavior education 0aveterinary medicine 0aveterinary behavior 0aanimal behavior problems1 aSerpell, James A.0 tJournal of veterinary medical education.g2008 Jan. 1, v. 35, no. 4 p.496-502dUniversity of Toronto Pressx0748-321X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3138%2Fjvme.35.4.4963Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03034naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100005600142245010500198300001800303520112900321592002801450650001501478650001101493650001201504650001401516650002301530650001101553650003001564650002101594650001501615650001301630650001101643650001301654650001301667700001301680700005501693700001901748700001201767700005601779700001801835700001901853700005701872700001901929700001301948700001501961700001601976700005901992700005702051700006602108700006202174773014702236856007602383852000902459655001202468IND60687136820221121085726.0200325e20200302xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068713682DNAL7 a10.1021/jacs.9b133472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Yuhang1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5336-518310aEnhanced Nitrate-to-Ammonia Activity on Copper‚ÄìNickel Alloys via Tuning of Intermediate Adsorption  ap. 5702-5708.  aElectrochemical conversion of nitrate (NO‚ÇÉ‚Äì) into ammonia (NH‚ÇÉ) recycles nitrogen and offers a route to the production of NH‚ÇÉ, which is more valuable than dinitrogen gas. However, today‚Äôs development of NO‚ÇÉ‚Äì electroreduction remains hindered by the lack of a mechanistic picture of how catalyst structure may be tuned to enhance catalytic activity. Here we demonstrate enhanced NO‚ÇÉ‚Äì reduction reaction (NO‚ÇÉ‚ÄìRR) performance on Cu‚ÇÖ‚ÇÄNi‚ÇÖ‚ÇÄ alloy catalysts, including a 0.12 V upshift in the half-wave potential and a 6-fold increase in activity compared to those obtained with pure Cu at 0 V vs reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE). Ni alloying enables tuning of the Cu d-band center and modulates the adsorption energies of intermediates such as *NO‚ÇÉ‚Äì, *NO‚ÇÇ, and *NH‚ÇÇ. Using density functional theory calculations, we identify a NO‚ÇÉ‚ÄìRR-to-NH‚ÇÉ pathway and offer an adsorption energy‚Äìactivity relationship for the CuNi alloy system. This correlation between catalyst electronic structure and NO‚ÇÉ‚ÄìRR activity offers a design platform for further development of NO‚ÇÉ‚ÄìRR catalysts.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3aalloys 3aammonia 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3acopper 3adensity functional theory 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3ahydrogen 3anickel 3anitrates 3anitrogen1 aXu, Aoni1 aWang, Ziyun1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2817-83671 aHuang, Linsong1 aLi, Jun1 aLi, Fengwang1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1531-29661 aWicks, Joshua1 aLuo, Mingchuan1 aNam, Dae-Hyun1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0871-13551 aTan, Chih-Shan1 aDing, Yu1 aWu, Jiawen1 aLum, Yanwei1 aDinh, Cao-Thang1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9641-98151 aSinton, David1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2714-64081 aZheng, G.q(Gengfeng),1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1803-69551 aSargent, Edward H.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0396-64950 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2020 Mar. 02, v. 142, no. 12 p.5702-5708dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19166x1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jacs.9b133473Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02953naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245011900170300001600289520190600305592002802211650001102239650001602250650001402266650001302280650001702293653002102310653001902331653001602350653001002366653001702376773013102393856008202524852000902606655001202615IND60520906620221118090753.0210302e20090101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052090662DNAL7 a10.2478/v10032-009-0010-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCebula, Stanis≈Çaw14aThe Effect of Pot Zize and Transplant Age on the Yield and Quality of White, Green and Romanesco Cauliflower Curds  ap. 101-110.  aThe subject of the experiment were three cultivars representing three different kinds of cauliflower: white (‚ÄµPlanita F‚ÇÅ‚Äµ), green (‚ÄµTrevi F‚ÇÅ‚Äµ) and romanesco (‚ÄµAmfora F‚ÇÅ‚Äµ). All plants were cultivated from transplants of various age (ca. 30 and 40 days) prepared in different size pots (96 and 160 cells/tray). The parameters of transplants ready for planting were determined and the yield level as well as commercial quality of curds was assessed. The fresh mass of overground part and root system of transplants of all cauliflower types was higher in case of older transplants and transplants grown in pots of larger cell volume. The commercial yield and the average curd weight were highest for white cauliflower cultivar, lower for green cultivar and the lowest for the romanesco type variety. All three cauliflower varieties reached their maximal values in this respect with the older-transplant and larger pot size. Most curds of grade I and the biggest diameter were formed in case of white cauliflower plants, slightly fewer of green variety and the least of the romanesco type. In case of all cauliflower varieties plants cultivated from older transplants had a larger root system, which ensured the best quality and most favourable marketable curds. Particular cauliflower types differed quite considerably in respect to their tendency to form curd defects (green bracts, hollow stem, riciness and browning). White cauliflower was the least susceptible to disorder in curd formation with the romanesco being the most sensitive type. In case of white cauliflower, transplants obtained from smaller pots, particularly in the case of younger transplants, resulted in the increased number of defects. However, in case of green and romanesco forms transplants produced in larger pots resulted in the occurrence of higher number of curd defects, particularly for older transplants.  aPublisher supplied data 3abracts 3acauliflower 3acultivars 3aplanting 3aroot systems 0acauliflower type 0atransplant age 0acell volume 0ayield 0acurd quality0 tJournal of Fruit and Ornamental Plant Research.g2009 Jan. 01, v. 70, no. 1 p.101-110dVersitawJournal:21649x1231-09487nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2478/v10032-009-0010-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02610naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094024002200132024001900154040001800173100002300191245015500214300001200369506007600381520127700457592002801734506003701762650003201799650001601831650001501847650001401862650001001876650001301886650001601899650000901915650002801924700002201952700002701974700001802001773008802019856008402107852000902191655001202200IND60113839920221207113214.0141112e201208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011383992DNAL7 a10.1016/j.molimm.2012.04.0062doi7 aPMC33616352pmcid7 a225803462pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBalter, Barbara B.10aMice lacking SŒº tandem repeats maintain RNA polymerase patterns but exhibit histone modification pattern shifts linked to class switch site locations  ap. 1-8.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aAntibody switching involves class switch recombination (CSR) events between switch (S) regions located upstream of heavy chain constant (C) genes. Mechanisms targeting CSR to S-regions are not clear. Deletion of SŒº tandem repeat (SŒºTR) sequences causes CSR to shift into downstream regions that do not undergo CSR in WT B-cells, including the CŒº-region. We now find that, in SŒºTR‚Åª/‚Åª B cells, SŒº chromatin histone modification patterns also shift downstream relative to WT and coincide with SŒºTR‚Åª/‚Åª CSR locations. Our results suggest that histone H3 acetylation and methylation are involved in accessibility of switch regions and that these modifications are not dependent on the underlying sequence, but may be controlled by the location of upstream promoter or regulatory elements. Our studies also show RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) loading increases in the EŒº/IŒº region in stimulated B cells; these increases are independent of SŒºTR sequences. Longer SŒº deletions have been reported to eliminate increases in RNAPII density, therefore we suggest that sequences between IŒº and SŒº (possibly the IŒº splicing region as well as G-tracts that are involved in stable RNA:DNA complex formation during transcription) might control the RNAPII density increases.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDNA-directed RNA polymerase 3aacetylation 3aantibodies 3achromatin 3agenes 3ahistones 3amethylation 3amice 3atandem repeat sequences1 aCiccone, David N.1 aOettinger, Marjorie A.1 aSelsing, Erik0 tMolecular immunology.g2012 Aug., v. 52, no. 1 p.1-8dElsevier Ltdx0161-58907nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.molimm.2012.04.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02908naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002300094024002200117024001900139040001800158100002100176245006900197300001500266520127200281592002801553650001501581650001401596650001501610650001501625650001901640650001301659650001401672650002601686650001201712650001701724650001701741700001801758700001701776700002201793700002001815700001801835700002901853700002301882700001801905700001901923700002001942700002501962700002401987773015202011856007002163856010102233990002302334852000902357655001202366IND60608537820221119194039.0190510e20170407xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060853782DNAL7 a10.3791/555202doi7 aPMC55644862pmcid7 a284480232pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWare, Kathryn E.10aInduction of mesenchymal-epithelial transitions in sarcoma cells  ap. e55520.  aPhenotypic plasticity refers to a phenomenon in which cells transiently gain traits of another lineage. During carcinoma progression, phenotypic plasticity drives invasion, dissemination and metastasis. Indeed, while most of the studies of phenotypic plasticity have been in the context of epithelial-derived carcinomas, it turns out sarcomas, which are mesenchymal in origin, also exhibit phenotypic plasticity, with a subset of sarcomas undergoing a phenomenon that resembles a mesenchymal-epithelial transition (MET). Here, we developed a method comprising the miR-200 family and grainyhead-like 2 (GRHL2) to mimic this MET-like phenomenon observed in sarcoma patient samples.We sequentially express GRHL2 and the miR-200 family using cell transduction and transfection, respectively, to better understand the molecular underpinnings of these phenotypic transitions in sarcoma cells. Sarcoma cells expressing miR-200s and GRHL2 demonstrated enhanced epithelial characteristics in cell morphology and alteration of epithelial and mesenchymal biomarkers. Future studies using these methods can be used to better understand the phenotypic consequences of MET-like processes on sarcoma cells, such as migration, invasion, metastatic propensity, and therapy resistance.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiomarkers 3acarcinoma 3aepithelium 3ametastasis 3aneoplasm cells 3apatients 3aphenotype 3aphenotypic plasticity 3asarcoma 3atherapeutics 3atransfection1 aGilja, Shivee1 aXu, Shenghan1 aShetler, Samantha1 aJolly, Mohit K.1 aWang, Xueyang1 aBartholf Dewitt, Suzanne1 aHish, Alexander J.1 aJordan, Sarah1 aEward, William1 aLevine, Herbert1 aArmstrong, Andrew J.1 aSomarelli, Jason A.0 tJournal of visualized experiments.g2017 Apr. 07, , no. 122 p.e55520-e55520dJournal of Visualized ExperimentswJournal:jnl4469330x1940-087X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3791/555203Available from publisher's site  uhttp://www.jove.com/video/55520/induction-of-mesenchymal-epithelial-transitions-in-sarcoma-cells  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02574naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094040001800138100002000156245011100176300002000287520117800307592002801485650002601513650001701539650003001556650002601586650002701612650001601639650001301655650001801668650001601686650001601702650001601718650000901734650001401743650001601757650003201773650001501805700002501820700001801845700001701863700001801880700001801898773008901916856009002005852000902095655001202104IND60090565220221121070127.0141102e201312  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009056522DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biomaterials.2013.09.0372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuang, Han-Ning10aUse of the antimicrobial peptide Epinecidin-1 to protect against MRSA infection in mice with skin injuries  ap. 10319-10327.  aMethicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) causes infections through open skin injuries, and its resistance makes treatment difficult. The antimicrobial peptide Epinecidin-1 (Epi-1) has been reported to possess antibacterial, antifungal, antiviral, and antitumor functions. This study investigated the antimicrobial activity of Epi-1 against skin trauma-mediated MRSA infection in mice. One square centimeter of outer skin was excised from the ventral region of mice, and a lethal dose of MRSA was applied in the presence or absence of methicillin, vancomycin, or Epi-1. While untreated mice and mice treated with methicillin died within four days, mice treated with Epi-1 survived infection. Epi-1 decreased MRSA bacterial counts in the wounded region, enhanced wound closure, and increased angiogenesis at the injury site. Treatment with Epi-1 decreased serum levels of the proinflammatory cytokines TNF-Œ±, IL-6, and MCP-1, and regulated the recruitment of monocytes and clearance of lymphocytes around the wounded region during healing. In conclusion, Epi-1 may be effective at treating clinical MRSA, and may enhance wound recovery when combined with collagen.  aPublisher supplied data 3aStaphylococcus aureus 3aangiogenesis 3aanti-infective properties 3aantibiotic resistance 3aantimicrobial peptides 3ablood serum 3acollagen 3ainterleukin-6 3alethal dose 3alymphocytes 3amethicillin 3amice 3amonocytes 3aplate count 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha 3avancomycin1 aRajanbabu, Venugopal1 aPan, Chieh-Yu1 aChan, Yi-Lin1 aWu, Chang-Jer1 aChen, Jyh-Yih0 tBiomaterials.g2013 Dec., v. 34, no. 38 p.10319-10327dElsevier Ltdx0142-96127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biomaterials.2013.09.0373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03387naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245009200169300001300261520216700274592002802441650001902469650001202488650001802500650002302518650001402541650003602555650001302591650001302604651001702617653002202634653002602656653002402682653001402706653002602720700001602746700001302762773010802775856008502883852000902968655001202977IND60573666020221121020514.0170724e20170102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057366602DNAL7 a10.2989/1814232X.2017.13033962doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRollinson, DP10aPatterns and trends in seabird bycatch in the pelagic longline fishery off South Africa  ap. 9-25.  aBoth foreign and domestic pelagic longline fishing vessels operate in South Africa‚Äôs Exclusive Economic Zone and adjacent international waters where they kill hundreds of seabirds each year as bycatch. To update assessments of the impact of the pelagic longline fishery on seabirds off South Africa, information on necropsied seabirds and national fisheries observer bycatch records were summarised for 2006‚Äì2013. Foreign-flagged (Asian) vessels had 100% observer coverage throughout the study period, whereas only 6% of the fishing effort by South African-flagged vessels was observed (with no coverage in 2011‚Äì2013). Vessels with observers caught seabirds at a rate of 0.132 birds per 1 000 hooks, resulting in an estimated mortality of 2 851 individuals (356 per year) comprising 14 species. Extrapolation of the observed fishing sets to the unobserved fishing sets by the South African domestic longline fleet suggested that approximately 750 additional birds were likely killed during the study period, therefore a combined 450 birds were killed per year. White-chinned petrel Procellaria aequinoctialis was the most frequently killed species (66%), followed by ‚Äòshy-type‚Äô albatrosses Thalassarche cauta/steadi (21%), black-browed albatross T. melanophris (7%), Indian yellow-nosed albatross T. carteri (3%), and Cape gannet Morus capensis (2%). The seabird bycatch rates were lower than in 1998‚Äì2005. Nationality of the vessel, time of line-setting, moon phase, year, season, fishing area, and seabird bycatch mitigation measures all influenced seabird mortality. Concurrent with 100% observer coverage, significant reductions in the seabird bycatch rate occurred in the Asian fleet in the latter years of the study, and these rates now approximate the national target (0.05 birds per 1 000 hooks). However, seabird bycatch rates remained high in the South African fleet, where no observers were deployed during 2011‚Äì2013, highlighting the need for independent observer programmes in fisheries‚Äîa matter of global interest. Suggestions are made as to how seabird bycatch by pelagic longline fisheries off South Africa may be further reduced.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMorus capensis 3abycatch 3afishing boats 3alongline fisheries 3amortality 3anationalities and ethnic groups 3anecropsy 3aseabirds 3aSouth Africa 0afishery observers 0aAsian-flagged vessels 0amitigation measures 0amortality 0atuna longline fishery1 aWanless, RM1 aRyan, PG0 tAfrican journal of marine science.g2017 Jan. 2, v. 39, no. 1 p.9-25dTaylor & Francisx1814-23387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2989/1814232X.2017.13033963Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03171naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245015400169520185800323592002802181650001502209650001402224650002202238650003402260650002302294650001102317650001502328650001602343650002302359653003102382653003002413653002702443653001102470653001802481700001902499700001602518700001902534773011302553856008602666852000902752655001202761IND60699777920221122032333.0210121e20201010xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069977792DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.1225082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRen, Yingqiu,12aA robust approach to state of charge assessment based on moving horizon optimal estimation considering battery system uncertainty and aging condition  aAccurate battery state information is essential for battery management system application and safety monitoring. However, it is a challenge task to obtain satisfied estimation results due to the uncertainties and inconsistencies of battery packs caused by aging. To solve this challenge, an optimization-based moving horizon estimation approach is presented in this paper for battery state and parameter online estimation. The dynamic battery parameters including open circuit voltage and internal resistance in equivalent circuit model are described by polynomial function of state of charge and input current for estimation algorithm design. And the intrinsic connection and difference between extended Kalman filter and moving horizon estimation algorithm are explicitly explained. Both of them are least square based estimation approach, and Kalman filter is a special form of moving horizon estimation, while moving horizon estimation relax Markov assumption compared with extended Kalman method. And then the optimization-based moving horizon estimation is designed for parameters and state of charge online assessment for battery dynamic system. To reduce computing time, the software framework CasADi is used for differential-algebraic calculation and nonlinear optimization. Three mismatch working conditions are studied for estimation performance validation, including mismatched initial guess values and battery dynamic characteristics difference caused by aging condition. The experimental results demonstrate that optimization-based moving horizon estimation performs better than Kalman filter-based approaches in terms of estimation precision, convergence time and robust. The proposed optimization-based moving horizon estimation is a promising approach for state of charge estimation in commercial battery management system applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3abatteries 3acomputer software 3aelectric potential difference 3amanagement systems 3amodels 3amonitoring 3auncertainty 3aworking conditions 0aState of charge estimation 0aMoving horizon estimation 0aNonlinear optimization 0aRobust 0aUncertainties1 aZhang, Hongwei1 aGao, Zepeng1 azhao, Yuzhuang0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2020 Oct. 10, v. 270 p.122508-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.1225083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03712naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100005600139245014100195300001500336500001400351500002000365520194300385592002802328596003302356650002702389650003002416650001502446650002002461650002202481650002202503650001102525650001202536650001402548650000902562650002302571700005602594700002002650700005202670700005602722700001802778700001602796700001702812700001402829700002902843700005802872700006202930773012002992856007303112852000903185655001203194IND60728220620221120162711.0210218e202102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072822062DNAL7 a10.1111/acv.126032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMajor, R.

Conservation management actions such as predator removal, captive breeding and reintroduction can facilitate numerical recovery of a population, but species often remain at risk from depleted genetic diversity and inbreeding. We investigated dispersal, genetic bottlenecks and genetic population structuring in the island‚Äêdwelling Lord Howe woodhen, a species that came perilously close to extinction in the 1970s. Analyses of mark‚Äêresighting records and variable genetic markers (single‚Äênucleotide polymorphisms) collected from the contemporary population and 100‚Äêyear‚Äêold museum specimens found strong evidence of restricted dispersal at fine spatial scales, with both the contemporary and historic populations exhibiting strong population structuring between mountain and lowland/slopes sites. Additionally, genetic comparison of the contemporary population and historic specimens demonstrated a decline in genetic diversity over the past century. Specifically for the Lord Howe woodhen, we recommend ongoing genetic monitoring and translocations to increase genetic diversity within the re‚Äêestablished lowland subpopulation. More generally, our results demonstrate how pronounced genetic erosion can arise in species subject to human persecution and predation by introduced predators, and how genetic fragmentation of natural populations can be present at fine geographical scales (less than hundreds of metres). Moreover, without prior information about genetic structure and subsequent genetic monitoring, conservation management can have unexpected negative consequences for the genetic health of populations. Therefore, genetic monitoring and management early in the recovery of populations is desirable to maximize their adaptive potential.  aPublisher supplied data  cAustralian Museum Foundation 3aGallirallus sylvestris 3abiodiversity conservation 3aextinction 3agenetic erosion 3agenetic structure 3agenetic variation 3ahumans 3amuseums 3apredation 3arisk 3athreatened species1 aEwart, K.

However, few reports on the influence of transgenic traits on genetic structure have been reported in the literature. It is unknown how or if transgenic cultivars have affected genotypic variation in upland cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) since its rise to dominance in cotton production. In this study, the genotypic variance components, g, of lint yield (LY) and fiber quality were compared among transgenic and nontransgenic cotton in the USDA Regional High Quality (RHQ) tests from 2002 through 2018. The popular transgenic and nontransgenic cultivars/lines developed by the major private and public cotton breeding programs in the United States during this period were included. Testing cycles within the RHQ protocol consist of standardized control cultivars plus experimental entries. Variance components were dissected in each testing year within six such testing cycles. Lint yield of the transgenic cotton was generally higher than nontransgenic cotton. Fiber quality of the nontransgenic cotton was generally higher than the transgenic cotton. For LY, the proportion of g to the total variance was lower in the transgenic cotton than in the nontransgenic cotton, but the difference diminished in the recent two cycles. The proportion of g was lower in the transgenic cotton compared with the nontransgenic cotton for fiber length, fiber strength, fiber uniformity, and micronaire. The discrepancy between the two types of cotton in the RHQ tests reflects the influences of differential breeding schemes in the private and public breeding programs on means and genotypic variance of LY and fiber quality.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGossypium hirsutum 3aUSDA 3acomparative study 3acotton 3acultivars 3aenvironmental impact 3agenetic structure 3agenetic variation 3alint yield 3amicronaire 3avariance1 aWu, Jixiang1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4484-47961 aBourland, Fred M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5998-87251 aCampbell, B.

Promising performance of this anode is achieved by stabilizing the material with Nb doping at B sites, which shows excellent chemical stability and high catalytic activity in the reducing fuel condition. The button cell based on lanthanum gallate electrolyte exhibits peak power density of 1.05‚ÄØW‚ÄØcm‚àí2 in H2, 0.64‚ÄØW‚ÄØcm‚àí2 in CH4 (‚àº3% H2O) and 0.57‚ÄØW‚ÄØcm‚àí2 in dry CH4 at 800‚ÄØ¬∞C, respectively. When the temperature is decreased to as low as 600‚ÄØ¬∞C, the cell still reaches 0.18‚ÄØW‚ÄØcm‚àí2 in hydrogen. The anode is highly resistant against redox cycling with capability of rapid recovery from oxidizing condition. Based on a series of performance durability tests under various fuel conditions, this anode material has been demonstrated to be feasible for long-term operation in dry CH4 without observable degradation. The results demonstrate a new technical route to develop highly active and stable ceramic anode by doping high-valence rare-earth elements into B sites of perovskite material.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanodes 3acatalytic activity 3aceramics 3adurability 3aelectricity generation 3aelectrolytes 3afuel cells 3afuels 3ahydrogen 3alanthanum 3amethane 3atemperature 0aSolid oxide fuel cells 0aDirect hydrocarbon 0aAnode material 0aCeramic oxide 0aLayered perovskite1 aZhou, Desheng1 aLiu, Shun1 aWu, Wei1 aYang, Yating1 aYang, Yingchao1 aTao, Zetian0 tApplied energy.g2019 Jan. 01, v. 233-234 p.37-43dElsevier LtdwJournal:11876x0306-26197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2018.10.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02861naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002200148245008200170300001800252500001900270500001100289520122400300592002801524596005101552596004901603596006701652650002101719650001901740650001501759650001001774650001501784650000901799650002501808650001301833650001701846700002301863700002301886700002201909700001901931700002601950700002101976700001801997700005202015700006002067773014902127856008202276852000902358655001202367IND60728874520221120054806.0210225e202102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072887452DNAL7 a10.1007/s00018-020-03666-w2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSalemme, Vincenzo14aThe p140Cap adaptor protein as a molecular hub to block cancer aggressiveness  ap. 1355-1367.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aReview  aThe p140Cap adaptor protein is a scaffold molecule encoded by the SRCIN1 gene, which is physiologically expressed in several epithelial tissues and in the neurons. However, p140Cap is also strongly expressed in a significant subset of cancers including breast cancer and neuroblastoma. Notably, cancer patients with high p140Cap expression in their primary tumors have a lower probability of developing a distant event and ERBB2-positive breast cancer sufferers show better survival. In neuroblastoma patients, SRCIN1 mRNA levels represent an independent risk factor, which is inversely correlated to disease aggressiveness. Consistent with clinical data, SRCIN1 gain or loss of function mouse models demonstrated that p140Cap may affect tumor growth and metastasis formation by controlling the signaling pathways involved in tumorigenesis and metastatic features. This study reviews data showing the relevance of SRCIN1/p140Cap in cancer patients, the impact of SRCIN1 status on p140Cap expression, the specific mechanisms through which p140Cap can limit cancer progression, the molecular functions regulated by p140Cap, along with the p140Cap interactome, to unveil its key role for patient stratification in clinics.  aPublisher supplied data  aIG-20107cAssociazione Italiana Ricerca cancro  a2017.2954cFondazione Cassa Risparmio Torino  aIG-2017-20258cAssociazione Italiana per la Ricerca sul Cancro 3abreast neoplasms 3acarcinogenesis 3aepithelium 3agenes 3ametastasis 3amice 3aneoplasm progression 3apatients 3arisk factors1 aAngelini, Costanza1 aChapelle, Jennifer1 aCentonze, Giorgia1 aNatalini, Dora1 aMorellato, Alessandro1 aTaverna, Daniela1 aTurco, Emilia1 aAla, Ugo1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5408-63971 aDefilippi, Paola1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6427-49060 tCellular and molecular life sciences.g2021 Feb., v. 78, no. 4 p.1355-1367dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl55291x1420-682X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00018-020-03666-w3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02699naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002200142245011100164300001600275520117000291592002801461650001401489650002101503650000901524650001601533650002001549650001701569650002401586650001101610650001001621650001201631650002701643650001001670650002001680650001801700650000901718650002301727650001001750650001401760653001101774653000901785653001201794653002901806653001301835700001701848700001901865700001501884700001401899773015901913856007602072852000902148655001202157IND60681670120221119170241.0200117e20190911xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068167012DNAL7 a10.3920/QAS2019.15842doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKemahlƒ±oƒülu, K.10aEffect of different raw materials on aroma fingerprints of ‚Äòboza‚Äô using an e-nose and sensory analysis  ap. 421-429.  aBoza is a Turkish traditional beverage produced by fermentation of maize, rice, wheat, millet, cracked wheat, and durum clear flour. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of different raw material combinations on the aroma fingerprints of boza samples using an electronic nose equipped with surface acoustic wave detector in combination with sensory analysis. According to flavour profile analysis of boza samples, significant differences were obtained among the samples. Hierarchical clustering analysis of e-nose and sensory analyses indicated that boza samples were clustered based on their aroma profiles, odour and taste properties revealing the effect of different cereals as raw materials. Rheological analysis showed that all boza samples exhibited pseudoplastic flow behaviour as the apparent viscosity decreased with increasing shear rate. This revealed that differences in raw materials did not change flow behaviour of boza samples. The results indicated that e-nose could be used as a fast and non-destructive method to assess the influence of raw material formulation on aroma profiles of boza samples in correlation with sensory analysis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacoustics 3acluster analysis 3acorn 3adurum wheat 3aelectronic nose 3afermentation 3afermented beverages 3aflavor 3aflour 3amillets 3anondestructive methods 3aodors 3aquality control 3araw materials 3arice 3asensory evaluation 3ataste 3aviscosity 0ae-nose 0aboza 0acereals 0aflavour profile analysis 0arheology1 aKendirci, P.1 aKadiroƒülu, P.1 aY√ºcel, U.1 aKorel, F.0 tQuality assurance and safety of crops & foods.g2019 Sept. 11, v. 11, no. 5 p.421-429dWageningen Academic PublisherswJournal:J000000147x1757-837X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3920/QAS2019.15843Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02894naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002200148245010800170300001600278520124500294592002801539650002601567650001001593650001901603650001701622650000901639650001001648650001401658650001201672650001301684650000901697650001401706650001501720650000901735650002501744653001701769653001701786653001301803653001301816653001301829653002301842653001601865653001001881653001401891653002301905700002101928700001701949700001701966700001601983700002001999700002202019700001902041700002002060773012002080856008302200852000902283655001202292IND60534510020221119102553.0190318e201402  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053451002DNAL7 a10.1016/j.rvsc.2013.11.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMavrogianni, V.S.10aTrematode infections in pregnant ewes can predispose to mastitis during the subsequent lactation period  ap. 171-179.  aObjective was to investigate if trematode infections predispose ewes to mastitis and/or metritis.

We found that for M-A, M-B and M-C ewes, respectively, median time to first case of mastitis was 5.75, 21 and 6.75days after lambing (P=0.003) and incidence risk of mastitis was 0.308, 0.069 and 0.222 (P=0.047). We postulate that trematode infections predispose ewes to mastitis; perhaps, increased Œ≤-hydroxybutyrate blood concentrations adversely affect mammary cellular defences. This is the first report associating parasitic infections with mastitis in sheep.  aPublisher supplied data 3a3-hydroxybutyric acid 3ablood 3ablood sampling 3aendometritis 3aewes 3afeces 3alactation 3alambing 3amastitis 3amilk 3apregnancy 3arafoxanide 3arisk 3atrematode infections 0aCo-infection 0aDicrocoelium 0aFasciola 0aMastitis 0aMetritis 0aPregnancy toxaemia 0aRisk factor 0aSheep 0aTrematode 0aŒ≤-Hydroxybuturate1 aPapadopoulos, E.1 aSpanos, S.A.1 aMitsoura, A.1 aPtochos, S.1 aGougoulis, D.A.1 aBarbagianni, M.S.1 aKyriazakis, I.1 aFthenakis, G.C.0 tResearch in veterinary science.g2014 Feb., v. 96, no. 1 p.171-179dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl45491x0034-52887nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rvsc.2013.11.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03774naa a2200721 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100005900152245013900211300001400350500001500364520184800379592002802227650001902255650002402274650002502298650001502323650002502338650002102363650001902384650002202403650001502425650001202440653000802452653000802460653000802468653000802476653000702484653000802491653000702499653001402506653002602520653000802546653000802554653002102562653000902583653000802592653001502600653000802615653000902623653002302632653002502655653000702680653000802687653000802695653000702703653000702710653000802717653000802725653003102733653000802764653000802772700002002780700002402800700002002824773010002844856008702944852000903031655001203040IND60617957820221121040828.0181222e20190101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061795782DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apenergy.2018.10.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Shuiliang1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1657-187410aStrategies for optimizing the power output of microbial fuel cells: Transitioning from fundamental studies to practical implementation  ap. 15-28.  a2019-12-06  aMicrobial electrochemical technologies, such as microbial fuel cells (MFCs), are attracting extraordinary attention due to their dual functions of waste removal and energy production from wastewaters. If deployed for decentralized wastewater treatment or integrated into existing wastewater treatment plants, the MFC technology has the potential to make the overall treatment process energy efficient. Despite numerous advances in fundamental and technological aspects, implementation of MFCs in real-world applications is taking considerable time. This is mainly due to critical limitations such as high capital costs per treatment capacity versus competing existing wastewater treatment technologies. In particular, low substrate turnover rates and concurrently low power outputs are the key hindrances for scaling-up of wastewater treating MFCs. Here, we provide a systematic multi-perspective overview of distinct strategies for optimizing MFC performance in terms of electric power output. A brief discussion on fundamental aspects of power losses at different current densities is followed by an extensive analysis of the measures that can be undertaken for optimizing power output and decreasing power losses. Special emphasis is given to addressing voltage reversal issues associated mainly with practically-relevant systems. Finally, future perspectives and research directions that need progressive considerations for realizing real-world applications for MFCs are presented. We propose reporting additional MFC performance indicator numbers to better facilitate their cross-comparison with each other and other energy producing technologies. By presenting a consolidated information source on different power optimization strategies, this review provides a valuable guideline for optimizing the electrical energy generation of MFCs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aprocess energy 3ainformation sources 3awastewater treatment 3aguidelines 3amicrobial fuel cells 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectric power 3aenergy efficiency 3awastewater 3acapital 0aCVD 0aMFC 0aLSV 0aORR 0aWW 0aEAM 0aDC 0aBioenergy 0aElectroactive biofilm 0aSCV 0aMPP 0aVoltage reversal 0aCNTs 0aEAB 0aPower loss 0aSHE 0aRint 0aelectric potential 0aWastewater treatment 0aSS 0aSEA 0aEET 0aCE 0aET 0aVCR 0aWWT 0aBioelectrochemical systems 0aCOD 0aOCV1 aPatil, Sunil A.1 aBrown, Robert Keith1 aSchr√∂der, Uwe,0 tApplied energy.g2019 Jan. 01, v. 233-234 p.15-28dElsevier LtdwJournal:11876x0306-26197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2018.10.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02746naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002600152245013600178300001600314520103400330592002801364650002401392650001701416650001401433650000901447650001401456650001701470650001001487650001301497650002301510650001901533650001401552650002401566650003201590650001401622650002501636650001601661653002601677653001201703653002501715653002001740653001701760653001401777653001801791653001801809653001001827653001201837700006001849700005901909700001601968773010001984856008702084852000902171655001202180IND60526105220221122034850.0190402e20161201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052610522DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2016.05.1872doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChityala, Pavan Kumar10aEffect of xanthan/enzyme-modified guar gum mixtures on the stability of whey protein isolate stabilized fish oil-in-water emulsions  ap. 332-340.  aThe effect of xanthan gum (XG) and enzyme-modified guar (EMG) gum mixtures on the physicochemical properties and oxidative stability of 2wt% whey protein isolate (WPI) stabilized oil-in-water (O/W) emulsions containing 20%v/v fish oil was investigated. EMG was obtained by hydrolyzing native guar gum using Œ±-galactosidase enzyme. At higher gum concentrations (0.2 and 0.3wt%), the viscosity of the emulsions containing XG/EMG gum mixtures was significantly higher (P<0.05) of all emulsions. Increasing concentrations (0‚Äì0.3wt%) of XG/EMG gum mixtures did not affect the droplet size of emulsions. Microstructure images revealed decreased flocculation at higher concentrations. Primary and secondary lipid oxidation measurements indicated a slower rate of oxidation in emulsions containing XG/EMG gum mixtures, compared to XG, guar (GG), and XG/GG gum mixtures. These results indicate that XG/EMG gum mixtures can be used in O/W emulsions to increase physical and oxidative stabilities of polyunsaturated fatty acids in foods.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalpha-galactosidase 3adroplet size 3aemulsions 3afish 3afish oils 3aflocculation 3afoods 3aguar gum 3alipid peroxidation 3amicrostructure 3aoxidation 3aoxidative stability 3apolyunsaturated fatty acids 3aviscosity 3awhey protein isolate 3axanthan gum 0aOil-in-water emulsion 0aXanthan 0aEnzyme-modified guar 0aLipid oxidation 0aWhey protein 0aViscosity 0aParticle size 0aHydroperoxide 0aTBARS 0aHexanal1 aKhouryieh, Hanna1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1094-93431 aWilliams, Kevin1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4019-85281 aConte, Eric0 tFood chemistry.g2016 Dec. 01, v. 212 p.332-340dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8139x0308-81467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2016.05.1873Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02698naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100002100138245007600159300001600235520144700251592002801698650002301726650001801749650001901767650002001786650002401806650001401830650001701844650002701861650000901888650001601897650001501913650002401928650002401952650000901976650001101985650001301996650001302009700002202022700002102044773010602065856007202171852000902243655001202252IND60132911220221120201612.0150513e201502  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013291122DNAL7 a10.1002/etc.28002doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 ade Perre, Chlo√©10aFate and effects of clothianidin in fields using conservation practices  ap. 258-265.  aDespite the extensive use of the neonicotinoid insecticide clothianidin, and its known toxicity to beneficial insects such as pollinators, little attention has been given to its fate under agricultural field conditions. The present study investigated the fate and toxicity of clothianidin applied every other year as a corn seed‚Äêcoating at 2 different rates, 0.25‚Äâmg/seed and 0.50‚Äâmg/seed, in an agricultural field undergoing a corn‚Äìsoybean annual rotation, and conservation tillage. Concentrations were measured in soil, surface runoff, infiltration, and groundwater from 2011 to 2013. Clothianidin was detected at low concentrations in soil and water throughout the 2‚Äêyr corn and soybean rotation. Low and no‚Äêtillage had little or no effect on clothianidin concentrations. Laboratory toxicity bioassays were performed on nontarget species, including Daphnia magna, Hyalella azteca, Chironomus dilutus, Pimephales promelas and Eisenia fetida. Risk quotients were calculated from clothianidin concentrations measured in the field and compared with the laboratory toxicity bioassay results to assess the environmental risk of the insecticide. The risk quotient was found to be lower than the level of concern for C. dilutus, which was the most sensitive species tested; therefore, no short‚Äêterm environmental risk was expected for the species investigated in the present study.

In this system, the discs are adjoined to the medium, and the air is introduced into the substrate by an air pump through a silicone tube in order to spray the medium on the discs of the reactor. The microorganism is grown on the discs forming a biofilm, which is stable until the end of fermentation. The major advantage of this reactor is the maximum carotene concentration, which is achieved in a short fermentation time, resulting in high carotene productivity. The maximum carotene productivity (57.5¬†mg/L/day) was obtained in a culture grown in 1¬†L of the synthetic medium with an initial pŒó of 11.0, an aeration rate of 4 vvm, an inoculum ratio 1:5 of (+) and (‚àí) strain of B.¬†trispora and the discs rotating at 13¬†rpm. The carotene productivity in the MRBR was six times higher compared to that obtained in the conventional stirred tank reactor (STR). The results, along with the advantages of the MRBR, show that the suggested fermentation system can be used for carotene production by B.¬†trispora in industrial scale.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBlakeslea trispora 3aaeration 3aair 3abiofilm 3acarotenes 3afermentation 3afungi 3ainoculum 3asilicone 0aBioprocess engineering 0aModified rotary biofilm reactor 0aBlakeslea trispora 0aCarotenes 0aProductivity 0aOxidative stress 0aCAT 0aMRBR 0aROS 0aRBR 0aSOD 0aSTR0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2018 Feb. 10, v. 174 p.1114-1121dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2017.11.0483Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03045naa a2200673 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001600148245016100164300001600325520111500341592002801456650002501484650002101509650002101530650001301551650001601564650001301580650001101593650000901604650002001613650002201633650002001655650001101675650001801686650001101704650002001715650002101735650003501756650001201791653001001803653000801813653001001821653001301831653000901844653001101853653000801864653000801872653000901880653002601889653002101915653003601936653001701972653005101989700001402040700001202054700001402066700001502080700001602095700001802111700001802129773012002147856008302267852000902350655001202359IND60534510120221119101934.0190318e201404  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053451012DNAL7 a10.1016/j.rvsc.2013.11.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuo, Fanxia10aImmunoregulatory effects of Taishan Pinus massoniana pollen polysaccharide on chicks co-infected with avian leukosis virus and Bordetella avium early in ovo  ap. 260-266.  aIn recent years, co-infection of chicken embryos with immunosuppressive viruses and bacteria occurs with an annually increasing frequency. Consequently, studies on new and safe immunoregulators, especially plant polysaccharides, have become a popular topic in the poultry industry. In the present study, we selected 300 specific pathogen free embryonated eggs, which were injected with subgroup B avian leukosis virus (ALV-B) and Bordetella avium (B. avium) to establish an artificial co-infection model. The chicks that hatched from these co-infected embryonated eggs were treated with Taishan Pinus massoniana pollen polysaccharide (TPPPS). Results indicated that relevant indices in the co-infection group were significantly lower than that in B. avium-only group. Furthermore, pathogenicity of B. avium was exacerbated, with the chicks exhibiting decreased body weights. The TPPPS groups exhibited gradual improvements in immune function and developmental status. Therefore, in terms of improving immunologic function and production performance, TPPPS could be used as immunoregulator for immune responses.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAvian leukosis virus 3aBordetella avium 3aPinus massoniana 3abacteria 3abody weight 3achickens 3achicks 3aeggs 3aimmune response 3aimmunosuppression 3amixed infection 3amodels 3apathogenicity 3apollen 3apolysaccharides 3apoultry industry 3aspecific pathogen-free animals 3aviruses 0aTPPPS 0aALV 0aALV-B 0aB. avium 0aIL-2 0aIFN-Œ≥ 0aLTR 0ap27 0aConA 0aEmbryo-borne diseases 0aBordetella avium 0aSubgroup B avian leukosis virus 0aCo-infection 0aTaishan Pinus massoniana pollen polysaccharide1 aXue, Cong1 aWu, Cun1 aZhao, Xue1 aQu, Tinghe1 aHe, Xiaohua1 aGuo, Zhongkun1 aZhu, Ruiliang0 tResearch in veterinary science.g2014 Apr., v. 96, no. 2 p.260-266dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl45491x0034-52887nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rvsc.2013.11.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02730naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004500094040001800139100006000157245008300217300001600300520154000316592002801856650002201884650001601906650002201922650002301944650001101967650001701978653002301995653002202018653001702040700001602057700006002073700002102133773011302154856009202267852000902359655001202368IND60616296220221121014930.0190412e201811  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061629622DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biosystemseng.2018.09.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAbad√≠a, Ricardo1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6743-195110aGeneralisation of supply energy efficiency in irrigation distribution networks  ap. 146-155.  aEnergy efficiency in irrigation distribution networks can be estimated by following the method proposed by Abadia et¬†al (2008)¬†[Biosystems Engineering, 101, 21‚Äì27], in which energy efficiency is quantified in terms of global energy efficiency (GEE), a parameter that is a compound of the pumping energy efficiency (PEE) and the supply energy efficiency (SEE). PEE is related to pump functioning, while SEE is related to the design and management of the distribution system. Calculation of SEE by this method is limited to irrigation networks that have a single water intake at an elevation below that of the irrigated area and a single supplied sector. Results from the method are confusing for networks with more than one water supply point or irrigation sectors supplied by intakes located at elevations higher than that of the irrigated area. This paper proposes a modification of the earlier method that is appropriate to any type of layout and configuration of the irrigation network, with one or several water intake points and supplied sectors. The new model is applied to four different types of collective pressurised irrigation network, and the results are compared with those of the previous model. The influence of different measures taken to improve the SEE and determine the variables that affect this efficiency was analysed. The results show that adequate SEE values can be obtained with the proposed model for all the situations analysed, and that it is possible to quantify the improvements in SEE with the model.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenergy efficiency 3aengineering 3airrigated farming 3airrigation systems 3amodels 3awater supply 0aNetworks modelling 0aEnergy efficiency 0aWater supply1 aVera, Jorge1 aRocamora, Carmen1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0062-05981 aPuerto, Herminia0 tBiosystems engineering.g2018 Nov., v. 175 p.146-155dElsevier LtdaIAgrEwJournal:jnl70639x1537-51107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biosystemseng.2018.09.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04221naa a2200661 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003800135040001800173100002100191245016300212300001800375520191900393592002802312650000802340650002502348650001902373650001802392650002502410650001002435650001102445650001902456650001502475650001802490650003302508650001502541650002302556650003702579650004802616650002402664650003202688650003902720650006302759650002602822650003002848650004502878650001102923650006402934650002802998650004603026650003903072650003103111650003903142650004003181650004003221650002103261700001803282700002203300700001703322773009203339856008403431990002303515852000903538655001203547IND60087412320221118014651.0141102e201211  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008741232DNAL7 a228420432pmid7 aPMC34622242pmcid7 a10.1016/j.actbio.2012.07.0242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVines, Jeremy B.10aHydroxyapatite nanoparticle reinforced peptide amphiphile nanomatrix enhances the osteogenic differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells by compositional ratios  ap. 4053-4063.  aIn the field of bone tissue engineering, there is a need for materials that mimic the native bone extracellular matrix (ECM). This need is met through the creation of biphasic composites intended to mimic both the organic and inorganic facets of the native bone ECM. However, few studies have created composites with organic ECM analogous components capable of directing cellular behaviors and many are not fabricated in the nanoscale. Furthermore, few attempts have been made at investigating how variations of organic and inorganic components affect the osteogenic differentiation of human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs). To address these issues, biphasic nanomatrix composites consisting of hydroxyapatite nanoparticles (HANPs) embedded within peptide amphiphile (PA) nanofibers tailored with the RGDS cellular adhesion motif (PA-RGDS) were created at various HANP to PA-RGDS ratios. Fabrication of these biphasic nanomatrix composites was confirmed via scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The long-term cellularity and osteogenic differentiation of hMSCs in response to the different compositional ratios were then assessed by quantifying the timed expression of genes indicative of osteogenic differentiation, alkaline phosphatase activity, and DNA content over time. Decreased cellularity and the expression of genes over time correlated with increasing compositional ratios between HANP and PA-RGDS. The highest HANP to PA-RGDS ratio (66% HANP) exhibited the greatest improvement to the osteogenic differentiation of hMSCs. Overall, these results demonstrate that the compositional ratio of biphasic nanomatrix composites plays an important role in influencing the osteogenic differentiation of hMSCs. Based on the observations presented within this study, these biphasic nanomatrix composites show promise for future usage in bone tissue engineering applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aalkaline phosphatase 3abone formation 3acell adhesion 3aextracellular matrix 3agenes 3ahumans 3ahydroxyapatite 3ananofibers 3ananoparticles 3ascanning electron microscopy 3astem cells 3atissue engineering 3atransmission electron microscopy 2aAlkaline Phosphatasexgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aCell Adhesionxdrug effects 2aCell Differentiationxdrug effects 2aCore Binding Factor Alpha 1 Subunitxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aDurapatitexchemistry 2aGene Expression Profiling 2aGene Expression Regulationxdrug effects 2aHumans 2aMesenchymal Stem Cellsxcytologyxdrug effectsxenzymology. 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aNanoparticlesxchemistryxultrastructure. 2aOsteocalcinxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aOsteogenesisxdrug effects 2aPeptidesxchemistryxpharmacology. 2aReal-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction 2aSurface-Active Agentsxpharmacology 2aTissue Scaffolds1 aLim, Dong-Jin1 aAnderson, Joel M.1 aJun, Ho-Wook0 tActa biomaterialia.g2012 Nov., v. 8, no. 11 p.4053-4063dElsevier Ltdx1742-70617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.actbio.2012.07.0243Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01722naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245004400166300001600210520088600226592002801112650001201140650001101152650001101163650001501174650001701189650001401206650001601220773009401236856008101330852000901411655001201420IND60517783720221119221619.0160405e201603  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051778372DNAL7 a10.1134/S00978078160201602doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSvitoch, A.

In these periods, large-scale natural phenomena took place on the Caspian shelf, coasts, and adjacent inundated territories, including sea level drop, drying of a part of seabed, and change of landscapes and the sedimentation character. The neaped water area showed changes in water salt composition and temperature regime, along with a change in faunistic complexes. Different hierarchic state of sea level and different correlation with climate events on the surrounding territories was shown to take place during the regression with predominance of warm (interglacial) periods among them.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimate 3acoasts 3adrying 3alandscapes 3asaline water 3asea level 3atemperature0 tWater resources.g2016 Mar., v. 43, no. 2 p.270-282dPleiades Publishingx0097-80787nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1134/S00978078160201603Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03315naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100006600153245011700219300001600336520145000352592002801802650001401830650001501844650001901859650002001878650001701898650002001915650001501935650002901950650002001979650001001999650001702009650002802026650002302054650002102077650002402098650001502122650001702137650001102154650001402165650001502179650002102194650002002215650002702235650002202262653002202284653001402306653002002320653001202340653002102352700002702373700003202400700003202432700003102464773010902495856008802604852000902692655001202701IND60606607220221119064406.0190318e201612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060660722DNAL7 a10.1016/j.marenvres.2016.11.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMoreira, Lucas Buruaem1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7863-085X10aEffects of novobiocin and methotrexate on the benthic amphipod Ampelisca brevicornis exposed to spiked sediments  ap. 169-177.  aThe marine amphipod Ampelisca brevicornis was used as model organism of benthic macrofauna to assess the possible adverse effects of pharmaceuticals bound to sediments. Organisms were exposed to sediment spiked with novobiocin (NOV) and methotrexate (MTX) for 10 days in order to estimate the acute toxicity (lethal effects) produced by the two compounds. The surviving organisms were pooled and analyzed to determine their sublethal responses associated with different phases of metabolism (enzyme activities in phases I and II), oxidative stress (antioxidant enzyme activities and lipid peroxidation), and genotoxicity (DNA damage in the form of strand breaks). No lethal or sublethal effects were observed in the amphipods exposed to NOV. For organisms exposed to sediments spiked with MTX the results were found to calculate the concentration that was lethal to 50% of the organisms exposed in the toxicity tests (LC50 of 30.36¬†ng/g). MTX also induced the metabolism of enzyme detoxification activities in phases I and II. Oxidative stress and DNA damage in particular were also observed, indicating responses associated with MTX's mechanism of action. Both mortality and the set of applied biomarkers allowed for the assessment of bioavailability, oxidative stress, and genotoxicity of NOV and MTX. The information obtained in this investigation can assist in ecological risk assessment of marine sediments contaminated by pharmaceuticals.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAmphipoda 3aDNA damage 3aacute toxicity 3aadverse effects 3aantioxidants 3abioavailability 3abiomarkers 3aenvironmental assessment 3aenzyme activity 3afauna 3agenotoxicity 3alethal concentration 50 3alipid peroxidation 3amarine sediments 3amechanism of action 3ametabolism 3amethotrexate 3amodels 3amortality 3anovobiocin 3aoxidative stress 3arisk assessment 3asediment contamination 3asublethal effects 0aSediment bioassay 0aBiomarker 0aPharmaceuticals 0aBenthos 0aMarine pollution1 aMaranho, Luciane Alves1 aBaena-Nogueras, Rosa Mar√≠a1 aLara-Mart√≠n, Pablo Antonio1 aMart√≠n-D√≠az, Maria Laura0 tMarine environmental research.g2016 Dec., v. 122 p.169-177dElsevier LtdwJournal:1982x0141-11367nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.marenvres.2016.11.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02381naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094040001800138100002400156245010000180300001800280520141900298592002801717650001501745650001101760650001601771650002401787700001901811700001801830700002001848700001301868773008701881856009001968852000902058655001202067IND60090565720221121070326.0141102e201312  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009056572DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biomaterials.2013.09.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChiang, Martin Y.M.10aRelationships among cell morphology, intrinsic cell stiffness and cell‚Äìsubstrate interactions  ap. 9754-9762.  aCell modulus (stiffness) is a critical cell property that is important in normal cell functions and increasingly associated with disease states, yet most methods to characterize modulus may skew results. Here we show strong evidence indicating that the fundamental nature of free energies associated with cell/substrate interactions regulates adherent cell morphology and can be used to deduce cell modulus. These results are based on a mathematical model of biophysics and confirmed by the measured morphology of normal and cancerous liver cells adhered on a substrate. Cells select their final morphology by minimizing the total free energy in the cell/substrate system. The key mechanism by which substrate stiffness influences cell morphology is the energy tradeoff between the stabilizing influence of the cell-substrate interfacial adhesive energy and the destabilizing influence of the total elastic energies in the system. Using these findings, we establish a noninvasive methodology to determine the intrinsic modulus of cells by observing global changes in cell morphology in response to substrate stiffness. We also highlight the importance of selecting a relevant morphological index, cell roundness, that reflects the interchange between forms of energy governing cell morphology. Thus, cell-substrate interactions can be rationalized by the underlying biophysics, and cell modulus is easily measured.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiophysics 3aenergy 3ahepatocytes 3amathematical models1 aYangben, Yanzi1 aLin, Nancy J.1 aZhong, Julia L.1 aYang, Li0 tBiomaterials.g2013 Dec., v. 34, no. 38 p.9754-9762dElsevier Ltdx0142-96127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biomaterials.2013.09.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03119naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001500151245017900166300001400345520162800359592002801987650002302015650001202038650001202050650001402062650001802076650001102094650001402105650002502119650001402144650001202158650001502170651001202185653002402197653001802221653001202239653002302251653001802274653001602292653002102308700001902329700001302348700001902361700001502380700001502395773010902410856008502519852000902604655001202613IND60573666520221121051454.0170724e20170102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057366652DNAL7 a10.2989/1814232X.2017.13034022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aElhasni, K10aDistribution, abundance and population structure of Hexaplex trunculus and Bolinus brandaris (Gastropoda: Muricidae) in offshore areas of the Gulf of Gab√®s, southern Tunisia  ap. 69-82.  aThe banded murex Hexaplex trunculus and purple dye murex Bolinus brandaris are frequently caught as bycatch by bottom trawlers operating in the Gulf of Gab√®s, southern Tunisia. Although these muricid gastropods might importantly constitute an additional source of income for fishermen as well as help to diversify local shellfish production, information on their catches is relatively scarce. Hence, the present study aimed to assess the status of local populations of H. trunculus and B. brandaris , including data on their spatial and depth distributions, abundance, biomass, population structure and mortality. Fishing surveys using bottom trawls were performed between May 2006 and June 2007 in offshore areas of the Gulf of Gab√®s. In total, 198 fishing hauls were analysed, corresponding to a total fishing duration of 333.3 hours and a total prospecting area of 1 534 ha at depths of 20‚Äì86 m. Altogether, 3 026 H. trunculus and 3 599 B. brandaris of a broad size range (22.9‚àí91.1 and 22.4‚àí97.0 mm shell length, respectively) were sampled during the study period. GIS-produced maps were employed to determine the species‚Äô spatial and bathymetric distributions by extrapolating their estimated fishing yield (bycatch per unit effort), abundance, biomass and mortality in relation to the total area surveyed in the gulf. The results provide valuable baseline information that may be applied to management proposals for regulating this untargeted resource, ultimately assisting sustainable exploitation and long-term preservation of this alternative fishing resource in the offshore areas of the Gulf of Gab√®s.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHexaplex trunculus 3abiomass 3abycatch 3afishermen 3afishing boats 3aincome 3amortality 3apopulation structure 3ashellfish 3asurveys 3atrawl nets 3aTunisia 0aartisanal fisheries 0abottom trawls 0abycatch 0afishery management 0afishery yield 0aGIS mapping 0astock assessment1 aVasconcelos, P1 aDhieb, K1 aEl Lakhrach, H1 aGhorbel, M1 aJarboui, O0 tAfrican journal of marine science.g2017 Jan. 2, v. 39, no. 1 p.69-82dTaylor & Francisx1814-23387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2989/1814232X.2017.13034023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02011naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245006200170300001600232520092500248592002801173650002201201650001901223650002501242650001801267650002201285650002801307650001201335650002101347653002301368653002101391700002201412773013701434856008101571852000901652655001201661IND60651464520221116141233.0190711e201806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065146452DNAL7 a10.1017/S1355770X170003532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBarbier, Edward B.10aPoverty, rural population distribution and climate change  ap. 234-256.  aOur spatial analysis indicates that in 2000 over one third of the rural population in developing countries was located on less favored agricultural land and areas, which are constrained by biophysical conditions or poor market access. We examine whether these spatial distributions of rural population in 2000 influence subsequent changes in the rate of poverty from 2000 to 2012 in 83 developing countries. We find no evidence of a direct impact on changes in poverty, but there is a significant indirect impact via the elasticity of poverty reduction with respect to growth. If climate change leads to more people concentrated in these areas, or an increase in unfavorable agricultural regions, then the poverty-reducing impact of overall per capita income growth could be further weakened. Reducing poverty will require targeting rural populations in less favored lands and remote areas and encouraging out-migration.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural land 3aclimate change 3adeveloping countries 3amarket access 3aper-capita income 3apopulation distribution 3apoverty 3arural population 0aless favored areas 0aspatial analysis1 aHochard, Jacob P.0 tEnvironment and development economics.g2018 June, v. 23, no. 3 p.234-256dCambridge University PresswJournal:2151x1469-43957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1355770X170003533Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03501naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094024002200132024001900154040001800173100001400191245009800205300001400303506007600317520206700393592002802460506003702488650001802525650002302543650001902566650001802585650002402603650001802627650000902645650001302654650001602667650002202683650001002705700001802715700002402733700002502757700001902782700002302801700002302824773009102847856008402938852000903022655001203031IND60113840520221207113342.0141112e201209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011384052DNAL7 a10.1016/j.molimm.2012.04.0072doi7 aPMC38659772pmcid7 a225783832pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYuan, Yao10aRole of microRNA-15a in autoantibody production in interferon-augmented murine model of lupus  ap. 61-70.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aMicroRNAs (miRNAs) are involved in the regulation of immunity via targeting of mRNA encoding immune response elements. In this report, alterations in the expression of microRNAs as autoantibody levels increase was investigated. The (NZB√óNZW)F1 or B/W mouse model of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) naturally has increased autoantibodies with aging. IFNŒ± (type I IFN) accelerates B/W disease, however, the effects of a related IFN, IFNŒª, which is a type III IFN, is largely unknown. The purpose of the study was to investigate the relationship between IFN-accelerated disease, microRNAs, immunoregulatory B cell subsets and autoantibody production in the autoimmune-prone environment in vivo. B/W mice received osmotic pumps to chronically deliver IFNŒ± and IFNŒª for up to 16 weeks. Urine protein level was monitored weekly by urine strips and proteinuria was used as the disease marker. Splenic cells were taken for flow analysis of B cell subsets and levels of microRNAs determined. Plasma were analyzed for autoantibodies and microRNA levels. As a result of treatment, IFNŒ± accelerated proteinuria in a dose dependent manner, while IFNŒª single treatment did not show a significant effect, but greatly enhanced low dose IFNŒ± effects in the combination treatment. Both the splenic cellular and plasma miR-15a were elevated in diseased compared to pre-diseased mice as well as autoantibody levels. Autoantibodies and miR-15a levels were significantly correlated. The immunosuppressive B subpopulation, B-10, was reduced following IFNŒ± treatment. In addition in diseased mice, B-10 versus B-2 ratios were reduced in IFN-treated B/W compared to the control PBS treated group. In all B/W the miR-15a was highly expressed in the B-10 subset and this increased with disease development, suggesting that miR-15a has a specific negative effect on the B-10 subpopulation. In conclusion, our data support the involvement of elevated miR-15a in autoimmune disease development in B/W mice and suggest that decreasing this microRNA might be beneficial in B/W mice.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aanimal models 3aantibody formation 3aautoantibodies 3adose response 3alupus erythematosus 3amessenger RNA 3amice 3amicroRNA 3aproteinuria 3aresponse elements 3aurine1 aKasar, Siddha1 aUnderbayev, Chingiz1 aVollenweider, Daniel1 aSalerno, Erica1 aKotenko, Sergei V.1 aRaveche, Elizabeth0 tMolecular immunology.g2012 Sept., v. 52, no. 2 p.61-70dElsevier Ltdx0161-58907nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.molimm.2012.04.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03003naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100006300151245007800214520170000292592002801992650002502020650001702045650002102062650003302083650002302116650001202139650001102151650002902162650001902191651001002210653002102220653002802241653002202269653002302291653002602314700002202340700002302362773011302385856008602498852000902584655001202593IND60699778420221121235452.0210121e20201010xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069977842DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.1225162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSengupta, Subhanjan1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0324-298014aThe social ‚Äì market convergence in a renewable energy social enterprise  aThe paper examines how the market and social logics which are supposedly counter to each other, converge into one rather than being two distinctive sets of actions, in the actions of a renewable energy social enterprise in an emerging economy context. To provide a foundation, the research draws upon literature on renewable energy, social entrepreneurship, market orientation, and social value creation. A qualitative in-depth case study research design with inductive theory-building approach for grounded theory development was conducted with two socially and environmentally inclusive renewable energy social enterprises in rural India. This resulted in a novel framework on a converging process comprising of: (a) Involved Searching, (b) Dialogic Localizing, and (c) Engaged Implementing. First, there is ‚Äòinvolved searching‚Äô, where insights are generated through involved interactions for searching problematized contextual realities. Then, there is ‚Äòdialogic localizing‚Äô, where insights are shared and acted upon through dialogically inclusive and localized solving. Finally, there is ‚Äòengaged implementing‚Äô, where solutions are implemented through honest convincing and engaging mutuality. The findings make a novel contribution towards: (a) Going beyond the duality perspective and revealing social entrepreneurship as a phenomenon where the social and the market converge as an articulated whole, (b) Advancing hybrid organizing as a converging action with trappings of social value creation and market orientation, and (c) Revealing the potential of renewable energy social enterprises in blending the social and the market while working towards a sustainable environment.  aPublisher supplied data 3abusiness enterprises 3acase studies 3aentrepreneurship 3aenvironmental sustainability 3amarket orientation 3amarkets 3amixing 3arenewable energy sources 3asocial benefit 3aIndia 0aRenewable energy 0aSocial entrepreneurship 0aSocial enterprise 0aMarket orientation 0aSocial value creation1 aSahay, Arunaditya1 aHisrich, Robert D.0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2020 Oct. 10, v. 270 p.122516-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.1225163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02662naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245008400170300001800254520145000272592002801722650002501750650002101775650003301796650001901829650002201848650001601870651001801886653002801904653001301932653003101945653001401976653003101990700002502021700002002046773011502066856008602181852000902267655001202276IND60586252720221122171342.0200712e20180210xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058625272DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2017.11.0542doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGliedt, Travis10aInnovation intermediaries accelerating environmental sustainability transitions  ap. 1247-1261.  aInstitutions in the United States are undergoing modifications that present direct challenges for the environment and society and may result in institutional uncertainty and instability. This article explores whether innovation intermediaries can be employed as a key component of a strategy to create a window of opportunity for green job creation, infrastructure changes, and technological innovation in response to these types of institutional modifications. Based on a systematic literature review, this article outlines a framework that combines institutional modifications with technological innovation and infrastructure development as part of an economic development strategy. Important findings are that connections between innovation intermediaries, such as incubator and accelerator centers, niche actors, such as green champions, and regime actors, such as policy entrepreneurs, show potential to contribute to a green economic development strategy but require further examination for the specific roles played by policy entrepreneurs to help create the conditions for scaling niche experiments and simultaneously disrupting the regime. The key contribution is in defining the role of sustainability-oriented innovation intermediaries at linking local, state and business actions in order to scale-up and influence green economic development in a politically feasible manner during times of institutional uncertainty and instability.  aPublisher supplied data 3abusiness enterprises 3aentrepreneurship 3aenvironmental sustainability 3ainfrastructure 3aissues and policy 3auncertainty 3aUnited States 0aPolicy entrepreneurship 0aChampion 0aGreen economic development 0aIncubator 0aInstituational uncertainty1 aHoicka, Christina E.1 aJackson, Nathan0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2018 Feb. 10, v. 174 p.1247-1261dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2017.11.0543Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01851naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094040001800138100001900156245008000175300001800255520074800273592002801021650001301049650002701062650001301089650001701102650001701119650002001136650001601156650001201172650002801184700002101212700001701233700001901250700002201269773008701291856009001378852000901468655001201477IND60090565820221121070313.0141102e201312  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009056582DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biomaterials.2013.09.0212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGabriel, Doris12aA photo-triggered layered surface coating producing reactive oxygen species  ap. 9763-9769.  aWe report a photoactive surface coating which produces cytotoxic reactive oxygen species (ROS) upon irradiation with near infrared (NIR) light.

We show that if inequality decreases over time, the social discount rate should be lower than the one obtained by the standard Ramsey rule under certain but reasonable conditions. Applied to the global discount rate and due to the projected convergence across countries, this implies that the inequality adjusted discount rate should be about twice as high as the standard Ramsey rule predicts. For individual countries on the other hand, where inequality tends to increase over time, the effect goes in the other direction. For the United States for instance, this inequality effect leads to a reduction of the social discount rate by about 0.5 to 1 percentage points. We also present an analytical formula for the social discount rate allowing us to disentangle inequality, risk, and intertemporal fluctuation aversion.  aPublisher supplied data 3adiscount rate 3arisk 3aUnited States 0aDiscounting 0ainequality 0aclimate change 0aconvergence 0aD63 0aH43 0aQ540 tEnvironment and development economics.g2018 Feb., v. 23, no. 1 p.19-36dCambridge University PresswJournal:2151x1469-43957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1355770X170003653Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03635naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001500140245026800155300001400423520176300437592002802200650002202228650003402250650001002284650002202294650001002316650001502326650002402341650001002365650002202375650002002397650001402417650002102431650001002452650004302462650002702505650001602532650000902548650001602557650002402573650001802597650000902615650001302624650001402637650002902651650004402680700001702724700001402741700001702755700001302772700001702785700001502802700001602817773011702833856007402950852000903024655001203033IND60666844820221120123914.0190919e20141202xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066684482DNAL7 a10.1039/c4ra08992h2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Chang10aUltra-high performance liquid chromatography coupled with time-of-flight mass spectrometry screening and analysis of potential bioactive compounds from traditional chinese medicine Kai-Xin-San, using a multivariate data processing approach and the MetaboLynx tool  ap. 85-92.  aTraditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) has been used in clinical practice for several thousand years, with an indispensable role in prevention and treatment of disease using multiple ingredients. Kai-Xin-San (KXS) is a TCM formula consisting of four herbs, Ginseng Radix, Polygalae Radix, Poria and Acori Tatarinowii Rhizoma, which has been used to treat Alzheimer's disease, depression and Parkinson's disease. However, the constituents absorbed into blood after oral administration of KXS remain unknown. Here, a sensitive and rapid method using ultra performance liquid chromatography/quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC/Q-TOF-MS/MS) combined with a multivariate data processing approach (Mdpa) and MetaboLynx software tool was used for analysis and identification of bioactive components and their metabolites in rat plasma following oral administration of KXS. A hyphenated MS/MS analyzer was used for determination of accurate fragment ions and mass spectrometric fragmentation mechanisms, and enhanced data acquisition. Metabolite elucidation was performed using UPLC/Q-TOF-MS/MS coupled with MetaboLynx tool. With the established method, a total of 49 peaks were tentatively characterized in vivo based on MS and MS/MS data, and comparison with available databases. Of the 49 compounds tentatively characterized in rat plasma, seven metabolites were detected and identified by comparing their fragmentation patterns using MetaboLynx software tool. On the basis of the chromatographic peak area, the glucuronidated conjugates were identified as major metabolites. This work demonstrated the potential of the UPLC/Q-TOF-MS/MS with Mdpa and MetaboLynx for rapid, simple, reliable and automated identification of metabolites of herbal medicine.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAlzheimer disease 3aOriental traditional medicine 3aPanax 3aParkinson disease 3aPoria 3aautomation 3abioactive compounds 3ablood 3acomputer software 3adata collection 3adatabases 3aherbal medicines 3aherbs 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3ainformation processing 3aingredients 3aions 3ametabolites 3aoral administration 3arapid methods 3arats 3arhizomes 3ascreening 3atandem mass spectrometry 3aultra-performance liquid chromatography1 aZhang, Aihua1 aHan, Ying1 aLu, Shengwen1 aSun, Hui1 aYan, Guangli1 aWang, Ping1 aWang, Xijun0 tRSC advances.g2014 Dec. 02, v. 5, no. 1 p.85-92dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c4ra08992h3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02103naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001700146245008000163300001800243520108800261592002801349650002201377650002101399650001101420650002301431650001301454650001801467650001401485650001701499700001501516700002201531773012101553856008201674852000901756655001201765IND60566227520221120090255.0170406e20170406xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056622752DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcb.7b010722doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNguyen, Kien10aHow the Ribosomal A-Site Finger Can Lead to tRNA Species-Dependent Dynamics  ap. 2767-2775.  aProteins are synthesized by the joint action of the ribosome and tRNA molecules, where the rate of synthesis can be affected by numerous factors, such as the concentration of tRNA, the binding affinity of tRNA for the ribosome, or post-transcriptional modifications. Here, we expand this range of contributors by demonstrating how differences in tRNA structure can give rise to tRNA species-specific dynamics in the ribosome. To show this, we perform simulations of A/P hybrid-state formation for two tRNA species (tRNA·¥æ ∞·µâ and tRNA·¥∏·µâ·µò), which differ in the size of their variable loops (VLs). These calculations reveal that steric interactions between the VL and the ribosomal A-site finger (ASF, i.e., H38 of 23S rRNA) can directly modulate the free-energy landscape for each tRNA species. We also find that tRNA and ASF motions are highly correlated, where fluctuations of the ASF are predictive of tRNA transition events. Finally, by introducing perturbations to the model, we demonstrate that ASF flexibility is a determinant of the rate of A/P hybrid-state formation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGibbs free energy 3abinding capacity 3amodels 3aphysical chemistry 3aproteins 3aribosomal RNA 3aribosomes 3atransfer RNA1 aYang, Huan1 aWhitford, Paul C.0 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2017 Apr. 06, v. 121, no. 13 p.2767-2775dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-52077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.jpcb.7b010723Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02714naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002100140245013100161300002000292520112400312592002801436650002201464650003701486650001701523650001501540650001901555650001401574650002301588650001101611650001101622650001501633650001701648650001501665650001101680650001301691650001301704650002001717650001101737650001701748650001701765650003301782650000901815650003701824700001501861700001701876700001501893700001401908700001601922700001501938773012401953856007402077852000902151655001202160IND60667258020221119041533.0190919e20150317xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066725802DNAL7 a10.1039/c4ra16832a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Qiongqiong12aA Co‚ÇÉO‚ÇÑ‚ÄìCeO‚ÇÇ functionalized SBA-15 monolith with a three-dimensional framework improves NO‚Çì-assisted soot combustion  ap. 26815-26822.  aIn this work, a cobalt and cerium composite oxide functionalized SBA-15 monolith (SM) with an inner three-dimensional (3D) network structure (CoCe/SM) was prepared by isovolumetric impregnation.

Thus, conservation techniques, such as cryopreservation, may be used for species and cultivar maintenance. It is important to understand the effect of low temperature used for cooling on the genetic stability and anatomical aspects of conserved species. The objective of this study was to evaluate the occurrence of anatomical changes and the maintenance of the cytogenetic stability of plants recovered from cryopreserved bird of paradise zygotic embryos. Zygotic embryos were cryopreserved in liquid nitrogen (+LN) after being dehydrated for 0, 30, and 60 min using silica gel (moisture content 16.79, 11.38, and 11.49%, respectively). Considering the dehydration duration, seedling development was higher (66.13%) in embryos that were cryopreserved after 30-min dehydration period, with no differences in the survival percentage during acclimatization, no anatomical changes in photosynthetic tissues, and no changes in the cytogenetic stability of the plants verified by flow cytometry. Thus, it is concluded that it is possible to cryopreserve bird of paradise zygotic embryos without changing the anatomy or genetic stability of the plants.  aPublisher supplied data 3aStrelitzia reginae 3aacclimation 3abirds 3acryopreservation 3acultivars 3acytogenetics 3aeconomic valuation 3afloriculture 3aflow cytometry 3agenetic stability 3aliquid nitrogen 3amarkets 3aornamental plants 3aphotosynthesis 3aseedlings 3asilica gel 3atemperature 3awater content1 aPaiva, Patricia Duarte de Oliveira,1 ada Silva, Diogo Pedrosa Corr√™a1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7787-75001 aPaiva, Renato1 aMesquita, Raquel1 aSouza, Rafaela Ribeiro1 ados Reis, Michele Valqu√≠ria0 tIn vitro cellular & developmental biology.g2021 Apr., v. 57, no. 2 p.272-280dSpringer USwJournal:jnl47889x1054-54767nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11627-020-10149-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01607naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245013000158300001800288520047800306592002800784650001400812650001600826650002200842650001700864650002100881650001900902650001300921650001900934650001300953700001400966700002100980700002801001773013301029856007401162852000901236655001201245IND60660851720221123022912.0190827e20150521xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066085172DNAL7 a10.1039/c4cc10092a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAnwar, Naveed10aRGD-decorated conjugated polymer particles as fluorescent biomedical probes prepared by Sonogashira dispersion polymerization  ap. 9358-9361.  aHere, we present a facile one-step Sonogashira dispersion polymerization affording monodisperse conjugated polymer particles bearing accessible acetylene moieties on the surface.

Simultaneous excitation of PSI and of the AuNR longitudinal plasmon mode and detection of photocurrents from individual PSI in relation to the position of single AuNRs enable insight into plasmon-induced phenomena that are otherwise inaccessible in ensemble experiments. We have observed photocurrent enhancement by the localized plasmons by a factor of 2.9 on average, with maximum enhancement values of up to 8. Selective excitation of the longitudinal plasmon modes by the polarization of the excitation laser enables controllable switch-on of the photocurrent enhancement. The dependence of the extent of enhancement on the distance between PSI and AuNRs indicates that, apart from the enhancement of absorption, there is an additional enhancement mechanism affecting directly the electron transport process. The present study provides deeper insight into the molecular mechanisms of plasmon-enhanced photocurrents, not only in PSI but also potentially in other systems as well.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3aatomic force microscopy 3aelectric current 3aelectron transfer 3afluorescence microscopy 3ananorods1 aOmagari, Shun1 aTan, Qiwen1 aLokstein, Heiko1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6739-46121 aVacha, Martin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5729-97740 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2021 Aug. 10, v. 143, no. 33 p.13167-13174dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19166x1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jacs.1c046913Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02231naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004900094040001800143100002900161245015000190300001600340500000900356520088200365592002801247650001201275650001201287650001901299650002101318650002101339650002201360650002001382650002701402650002501429650002601454650001201480650001801492650001201510700002301522700002301545773014801568856009601716852000901812655001201821IND60668632720221118154618.0191125e195811  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066863272DNAL7 a10.2136/sssaj1958.03615995002200060017x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAbru√±a, F.q(Fernando),10aQuantitative Evaluation of Soil Reaction and Base Status Changes Resulting from Field Application of Residually Acid-Forming Nitrogen Fertilizers  ap. 539-542.  aepub  aAn evaluation was made of the changes in soil reaction and exchangeable base content of two Red-Yellow Podzolic soils and one alluvial soil resulting from high rates of application of ammonium nitrate and of ammonium sulfate. Severe reductions in exchangeable base level and lowering of soil pH occurred within a year after beginning N applications. The undesirable effects occurred deep in the soil profile where corrections would be difficult, if not impossible, from a practical standpoint. Exchangeable K was lost from the soil faster than other bases at the higher rates of N. No indication of a subsoil zone of accumulation of bases leached out of upper horizons was observed. The measured losses of exchangeable bases were appreciably lower than calculated CaCO‚ÇÉ equivalents of the residual acidity of the fertilizer except for the higher N rates on the Toa clay loam.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPodzols 3aacidity 3aalluvial soils 3aammonium nitrate 3aammonium sulfate 3acalcium carbonate 3aclay loam soils 3aexchangeable potassium 3anitrogen fertilizers 3aquantitative analysis 3asoil pH 3asoil profiles 3asubsoil1 aPearson, Robert W.1 aElkins, Charles B.0 tSoil Science Society of America journal.g1958 Nov., v. 22, no. 6 p.539-542dSoil Science Society of AmericawJournal:jnl44580x0361-59957nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2136/sssaj1958.03615995002200060017x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02503naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002500144245010500169300001600274500001900290520131900309592002801628650002401656650001901680650002701699650001401726650001901740650001301759650002101772651001301793651001201806653002101818653002501839653001401864700002701878773012501905856007802030852000902108655001202117IND60704912920221119103453.0200727s2020    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070491292DNAL7 a10.1139/cjfr-2019-03872doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEngelken, Patrick J.10aRiparian forest conditions along three northern Michigan rivers following Emerald Ash Borer invasion  ap. 800-810.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aEmerald Ash Borer (EAB; Agrilus planipennis Fairmaire (Coleoptera, Buprestidae)) has killed millions of ash (Fraxinus spp.) trees since its 2002 detection in southern Michigan and Ontario. Effects of EAB in riparian forests, where ash species are often abundant, could influence terrestrial and aquatic conditions but are largely unknown. We surveyed vegetation and coarse woody material within and between three gaps in riparian forests along stretches of three rivers in northwestern Michigan. Gaps were originally dominated by Fraxinus pennsylvanica Marsh. and Fraxinus nigra Marsh., which comprised 46%‚Äì71% of total basal area, while ash comprised <10% of basal area in forests between gaps. More than 95% of overstory ash were killed by EAB. Fraxinus pennsylvanica saplings were abundant in gaps but F. nigra regeneration was minimal. Few tree seedlings occurred in gaps, which were dominated by dense sedge mats. Aerial imagery showed the EAB invasion has resulted in 3.6‚Äì7.1 canopy gaps¬∑km‚Åª¬π and dead ash account for 13%‚Äì21% of total basal area within 100 m of the banks of all three rivers. Long-term monitoring will be useful to evaluate persistence of ash, particularly F. nigra, the stability of riparian buffers, and potential indirect effects of EAB invasion on the adjacent aquatic systems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAgrilus planipennis 3aFraxinus nigra 3aFraxinus pennsylvanica 3aoverstory 3aremote sensing 3aresearch 3ariparian forests 3aMichigan 3aOntario 0aash regeneration 0ainvasive forest pest 0ablack ash1 aMcCullough, Deborah G.0 tCanadian journal of forest research.g2020, v. 50, no. 8 p.800-810dNRC Research PresswJournal:jnl2003x1208-60377nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjfr-2019-03873Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02538naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100003000152245015000182300001600332520098500348592002801333650001301361650001201374650002101386650001701407650001801424650001501442650001201457650002301469650002501492650001801517650001301535650001101548650002001559650001201579650001401591653003201605653002601637653001701663653002901680653002101709700002101730700002801751700002601779700002501805773010601830856008701936852000902023655001202032IND60584872720221117055354.0200509e201802  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058487272DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2017.10.0642doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSiddique, Muhammad Saboor10aInsight into the effect of organic and inorganic draw solutes on the flux stability and sludge characteristics in the osmotic membrane bioreactor  ap. 758-766.  aIn this study, chloride based (CaCl‚ÇÇ and MgCl‚ÇÇ) and acetate based (NaOAc and MgOAc) salts in comparison with NaCl were investigated as draw solutions (DS) to evaluate their viability in the osmotic membrane bioreactor (OMBR). Membrane distillation was coupled with an OMBR setup to develop a hybrid OMBR-MD system, for the production of clean water and DS recovery. Results demonstrate that organic DS were able to mitigate the salinity buildup in the bioreactor as compared to inorganic salts. Prolonged filtration runs were observed with MgCl‚ÇÇ and MgOAc in contrast with other draw solutes at the same molar concentration. Significant membrane fouling was observed with NaOAc while rapid flux decline due to increased salinity build-up was witnessed with NaCl and CaCl‚ÇÇ. Improved characteristics of mixed liquor in terms of sludge filterability, particle size, and biomass growth along with the degradation of soluble microbial products (SMP) were found with organic DS.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetates 3abiomass 3acalcium chloride 3adistillation 3afilterability 3afiltration 3afouling 3amagnesium chloride 3amembrane bioreactors 3aparticle size 3asalinity 3asludge 3asodium chloride 3asolutes 3aviability 0aOsmotic membrane bioreactor 0aMembrane distillation 0aDraw solutes 0aReverse solute transport 0aSalinity buildup1 aKhan, Sher Jamal1 aShahzad, Muhammad Aamir1 aNawaz, Muhammad Saqib1 aHankins, Nicholas P.0 tBioresource technology.g2018 Feb., v. 249 p.758-766dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46263x0960-85247nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2017.10.0643Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03959naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245009100166520216400257592002802421650002202449650001902471650003402490650002002524650001702544650001202561650001002573650002202583650001702605650001602622650001402638650001302652650001502665650001502680650002102695650001902716650001702735650002402752650001102776650001702787650001902804650001202823650001102835650001502846650001302861650001502874653001902889653001702908653002502925700001802950700001702968700001402985700001402999700005603013700005803069773011603127856008103243852000903324655001203333IND60749055520221121155508.0211213e20211205xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074905552DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jep.2021.1145552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXing, Bingcong10aPhytochemistry, pharmacology, and potential clinical applications of saffron: A review  aSaffron, the dried red stigma of the perennial herb Crocus sativus L. (Iridaceae), is one of the most important and expensive spices in the world. It is used as a traditional Chinese medicine with demonstrated effects in promoting blood circulation and suppressing blood stasis, cooling blood detoxification, and relieving depression. It is mainly used for the treatment of depression, irregular menstruation, postpartum thrombosis, and bruises. This review aims to provide a systematic and up-to-date overview of the phytochemistry, pharmacology, and clinical applications of saffron. We hope it could provide useful references and guidance for the future directions of research on saffron. The online database, such as Web of Science, Google Scholar, Science Direct, PubMed, SpringerLink, Wiley Online Library, SciFinder and Chemical book, and CNKI were used to collect relevant literature. And the classic books about Chinese herbal medicine were also being referenced. More than 150 chemical compounds, including carotenoids, flavonoids and flavonoid glycosides, monoterpenes and monoterpenoid derivatives, monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, amino acids, alkaloids and others, were revealed. The pharmacological activities study of saffron were focused on the antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antitumor, antidepressant, hypoglycemic, hypolipidemic, memory-enhancing, and so on. Currently, saffron is mainly used for the treatment of diabetes, Alzheimer's disease, depression, anxiety disorders, cardiovascular diseases, learning and memory disorders, cancer, and other conditions. Phytochemical and pharmacological analyses of saffron have been revealed in recent studies. However, clinical studies have focused mainly on AD, depression and anxiety disorders. Therefore, a large number of clinical trials are needed to study the efficacy of saffron and its major chemical components against other diseases including hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and cancer. Further studies of the mechanism of action and toxicological properties of saffron are also required, especially research to establish an effective dose of saffron and its long-term toxicity in vivo.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAlzheimer disease 3aCrocus sativus 3aOriental traditional medicine 3aantidepressants 3aantioxidants 3aanxiety 3ablood 3ablood circulation 3ablood stasis 3acarotenoids 3adatabases 3adiabetes 3aflavonoids 3aglycosides 3aherbal medicines 3ahyperlipidemia 3ahypertension 3amechanism of action 3amemory 3amenstruation 3amonoterpenoids 3asaffron 3astigma 3athrombosis 3atoxicity 3atoxicology 0aPhytochemistry 0aPharmacology 0aClinical application1 aLi, Shuailing1 aYang, Jiaxin1 aLin, Ding1 aFeng, Yue1 aLu, Jiangjie1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6523-687X1 aShao, Qingsong1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0171-51900 tJournal of ethnopharmacology.g2021 Dec. 05, v. 281 p.114555-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl30651x0378-87417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jep.2021.1145553Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03157naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094024002200131024001900153040001800172100002100190245017900211300001800390506007600408520175200484592002802236506003702264650001602301650003802317650001102355650001702366650001902383650001502402650001202417650002802429650001202457650003002469650003302499700001902532773010202551856008502653852000902738655001202747IND60568770920221207063727.0170516e20170516xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056877092DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.biochem.7b000872doi7 aPMC65438132pmcid7 a284370982pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYakovlev, Sergiy10aInteraction of Fibrin with the Very Low-Density Lipoprotein (VLDL) Receptor: Further Characterization and Localization of the VLDL Receptor-Binding Site in Fibrin Œ≤N-Domains  ap. 2518-2528.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aOur recent study revealed that fibrin and the very low-density lipoprotein receptor (VLDLR) interact with each other through a pair of fibrin Œ≤N-domains and CR domains of the receptor and this interaction promotes transendothelial migration of leukocytes and thereby inflammation. The major objectives of this study were to further clarify the molecular mechanism of fibrin‚ÄìVLDLR interaction and to identify amino acid residues in the Œ≤N-domains involved in this interaction. Our binding experiments with the (Œ≤15‚Äì66)‚ÇÇ fragment, which corresponds to a pair of fibrin Œ≤N-domains, and the VLDLR(1‚Äì8) fragment, consisting of eight CR domains of VLDLR, revealed that interaction between them strongly depends on ionic strength and chemical modification of all Lys or Arg residues in (Œ≤15‚Äì66)‚ÇÇ results in abrogation of this interaction. To identify which of these residues are involved in the interaction, we mutated all Lys or Arg residues in each of the three positively charged Lys/Arg clusters of the (Œ≤15‚Äì66)‚ÇÇ fragment, as well as single Arg17 and Arg30, and tested the affinity of the mutants obtained for VLDLR(1‚Äì8) by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and surface plasmon resonance. The experiments revealed that the second and third Lys/Arg clusters make the major contribution to this interaction while the contribution of the first cluster is moderate. The results obtained suggest that interaction between fibrin and the VLDL receptor employs the ‚Äúdouble-Lys/Arg‚Äù recognition mode previously proposed for the interaction of the LDL receptor family members with their ligands. They also provide valuable information for the development of highly specific peptide-based inhibitors of fibrin‚ÄìVLDLR interaction.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aamino acids 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3afibrin 3ainflammation 3aionic strength 3aleukocytes 3aligands 3alow density lipoprotein 3amutants 3asurface plasmon resonance 3avery low density lipoprotein1 aMedved, Leonid0 tBiochemistry.g2017 May 16, v. 56, no. 19 p.2518-2528dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-49957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.biochem.7b000873Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03253naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245019100167300001600358520214800374592002802522650002002550650001302570650001102583650001902594650001902613651001502632651001402647700002002661700002202681773009902703856008102802990002302883852000902906655001202915IND60099353420221117223333.0141105e20131201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009935342DNAL7 a10.1016/j.gca.2013.08.0252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMartin, Adam P.10aPetrogenesis of Cenozoic, alkalic volcanic lineages at Mount Morning, West Antarctica and their entrained lithospheric mantle xenoliths: Lithospheric versus asthenospheric mantle sources  ap. 127-152.  aTwo volcanic lineages are identified at Mount Morning, a Cenozoic to recent, eruptive centre in the Ross Sea, West Antarctica, which is part of the McMurdo Volcanic Group. Both the older (at least 18.7‚Äì11.4Ma), mildly alkalic, nepheline- or quartz-normative Mason Spur Lineage, and the younger (at least 6‚Äì0.02Ma), nepheline normative, strongly alkalic Riviera Ridge Lineage evolved by fractional crystallization from nominally anhydrous (<0.5wt% H‚ÇÇO) parental magmas. Both lineages are analogous to other, relatively anhydrous lineages in the McMurdo Volcanic Group and distinctly different from those in which kaersutite is present on the liquid line of descent. Sub-continental lithospheric mantle (SCLM) xenoliths entrained in Riviera Ridge Lineage rocks show trace element and isotopic Sr‚ÄìNd‚ÄìPb variation that is consistent with four-component mixing whereby depleted mantle has been refertilised by enriched, HIMU-like and Nb-enriched (carbonatite) components. Refertilization may have occurred c. 530‚Äì490Ma ago when fluids derived from subduction associated with Gondwanaland amalgamation infiltrated the SCLM. Similar trace element and isotope variation (Sr‚ÄìNd‚ÄìPb) in Mount Morning basaltic rocks and entrained xenoliths suggests that the source for the basaltic magmas lies (at least in part) in the lithospheric mantle. It has long been recognized that Cenozoic volcanic rocks in Antarctica (Victoria Land ‚Äì including Mount Morning ‚Äì and Marie Byrd Land), Zealandia and eastern Australia share common chemical and isotopic source characteristics and they have been argued to collectively constitute a single diffuse alkaline magmatic province (DAMP). Source characteristic similarities suggest DAMP volcanic rocks inherit at least some of their trace element and isotopic characteristics from the lithospheric mantle. Super-chondritic Nb/Ta values measured in some SCLM xenoliths and volcanic rocks at Mount Morning, and in volcanic rocks across the DAMP, can be explained by addition of ‚©Ω5wt% carbonatite to the source. The DAMP SCLM is a significant Nb reservoir that offers an explanation for the Nb paradox.  aPublisher supplied data 3acrystallization 3aisotopes 3amixing 3atrace elements 3avolcanic rocks 3aAntarctica 3aAustralia1 aCooper, Alan F.1 aPrice, Richard C.0 tGeochimica et cosmochimica acta.g2013 Dec. 1, v. 122 p.127-152dElsevier Ltdx0016-70377nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gca.2013.08.0253Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01743naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002300140245007400163300001600237500001900253520077200272592002801044650001101072650001301083650002001096650001301116650002001129700002001149700002201169700002101191773012201212856007401334852000901408655001201417IND60726214920221119133520.0210202e20210201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072621492DNAL7 a10.1039/d0gc02343d2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNasr Allah, Tawfiq10aCatalytic challenges and strategies for the carbonylation of œÉ-bonds  ap. 723-739.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe carbene character of carbon monoxide offers the possibility to utilize this C‚ÇÅ-building block for the carbonylation of a variety of organic substrates by insertion of CO into œÉ-bonds.

Fish were fed twice daily (08:30 and 18:30). The major hematological findings were significant increases in the red blood cell count, hematocrit value, and hemoglobin level in the rockfish fed diets over 100mg/kg ascorbic acid. The dietary ascorbic acid supplementation caused significant increases in the glucose and total protein, whereas notable decreases were observed in GOT and GPT. However, alterations in calcium and magnesium were not observed by the ascorbic acid supplementation. Plasma cortisol was substantially decreased over 50mg/kg ascorbic acid. Acetylcholinesterase activity of the rockfish was significantly increased over 200mg/kg ascorbic acid. In conclusion, the present study indicates that the dietary ascorbic acid supplementation in the rockfish induces considerable increases in hematological parameters, alterations in plasma components, and increase in AChE activity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSebastes schlegelii 3aacetylcholinesterase 3aascorbic acid 3acalcium 3acortisol 3adiet 3aenzyme activity 3aerythrocyte count 3aglucose 3ahematocrit 3ahemoglobin 3ajuveniles 3amagnesium 3aprotein content 3arockfish 0aHematological parameters 0aAcetylcholinesterase 0aRock fish (Sebastes schlegelii) 0aAscorbic acid1 aKang, Ju-Chan0 tAquaculture reports.g2016 Nov., v. 4 p.80-85dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23215x2352-51347nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aqrep.2016.07.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02599naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002000144245013000164300001600294500001900310520136300329592002801692650001201720650001201732650001301744650001601757650001101773650001501784650001301799650001501812650000901827650001501836650001601851650001001867653002201877653002901899653001701928700002001945773012501965856007802090852000902168655001202177IND60704913120221119103325.0200727s2020    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070491312DNAL7 a10.1139/cjfr-2019-04122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMcNab, W.

Our study objective was to evaluate Whittaker‚Äôs moisture condition index (MCI) (R.H. Whittaker. 1956. Ecol. Monogr. 26: 1‚Äì80) as a potential biotic variable for inclusion with conventional abiotic variables in oak (Quercus L.) SI prediction models. The MCI is the sum of relative abundances of inventoried plot tree species weighted by their moisture affinity classification. We compared regression parameters of conventional base models including only abiotic variables with exploratory models configured with abiotic variables and MCI for explaining variation of SI. The best abiotic model included only aspect. When MCI was included in the abiotic model, aspect became insignificant, resulting in a single-variable biotic model that accounted for increased SI variation. The MCI biotic model remained significant when tested with independent data from a distant location. The MCI is easily calculated using plot inventory data, and with further evaluation, it may be confirmed as a useful biotic variable in combination with abiotic soil and topographic variables for prediction of oak SI.  aPublisher supplied data 3aQuercus 3aforests 3ahardwood 3ainventories 3amodels 3aprediction 3aresearch 3asite index 3asoil 3atopography 3atree height 3atrees 0amoisture affinity 0amoisture condition index 0aproductivity1 aKeyser, Tara L.0 tCanadian journal of forest research.g2020, v. 50, no. 8 p.760-773dNRC Research PresswJournal:jnl2003x1208-60377nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjfr-2019-04123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03006naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002700111040001800138100001300156245009800169300001800267520134000285592002801625650001501653650002501668650001001693650002401703650001401727650001401741650001301755650001401768650001601782650001001798650001001808650001001818650002301828650001101851650004701862650001101909650007401920650003101994653001402025653002402039653002102063653002202084700001802106700001202124700001102136700001502147700001902162700001602181700001502197773013202212852000902344856007502353655001202428IND4463147520221120054629.0160905e20120215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446314752DNAL7 a222567772pmid7 a10.1021/jf204421c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYuan, Bo10aAbsorption and Plasma Disposition of Genistin Differ from Those of Genistein in Healthy Women  ap. 1428-1436.  aThe chemical forms in which isoflavones appear in food or supplements seem to play an important role in their absorption efficiency. However, the influence of the chemical form of isoflavones on their plasma disposition has never been reported, although the metabolites of isoflavones circulating in the blood may have biological activity themselves. The purpose of the study was to investigate the pharmacokinetic profiles of genistein (GEN) and its phase II metabolites in the plasma and urine of healthy young women after multiple doses of pure aglycone and glucoside forms of GEN. Genistein-7-glucuronide (G-7-G), 4‚Ä≤-glucuronide (G-4‚Ä≤-G), 7-sulfate (G-7-S), 4‚Ä≤-sulfate (G-4‚Ä≤-S), 4‚Ä≤,7-diglucuronide (G-4‚Ä≤,7-diG), and 7-glucuronide-4‚Ä≤-sulfate (G-7-G-4‚Ä≤-S) besides unconjugated GEN were observed in human plasma after ingestion of GEN and its glucoside. Among these metabolites, G-4‚Ä≤,7-diG and G-7-G-4‚Ä≤-S were the major ones, comprising both about 30% of the total amount of GEN in plasma. Compared with the aglycone, the amount of total GEN in vivo and those of G-4‚Ä≤,7-diG and G-7-G-4‚Ä≤-S were increased after the glucoside intake. No difference was observed in urinary excretion between the aglycone and the glucoside. Overall, the absorption and plasma disposition of GEN were affected by the glucoside form.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3abioactive properties 3ablood 3adietary supplements 3aexcretion 3agenistein 3agenistin 3aingestion 3ametabolites 3aurine 3awomen 2aAdult 2aCross-Over Studies 2aFemale 2aGenisteinxbloodxpharmacokineticsxurine. 2aHumans 2aIsoflavonesxadministration & dosagexbloodxpharmacokineticsxurine. 2aReproducibility of Results 0agenistein 0aphase II conjugates 0apharmacokinetics 0aurinary excretion1 aZhen, Huijuan1 aJin, Yi1 aXu, Li1 aJiang, Xue1 aSun, Shuaiting1 aLi, Chibing1 aXu, Haiyan0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2012 Feb. 15, v. 60, no. 6 p.1428-1436dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-51187nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fjf204421c3Available from publisher's site 7aarticle02174naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002200144245016200166300001600328520090100344592002801245650001401273650001701287650001101304650001801315650001001333650003301343650001601376650001601392650001401408650001801422650001101440651001101451653001401462653001901476653001501495653001701510700001701527700001801544773009101562856007801653852000901731655001201740IND60585547320221118032924.0171110e20171101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058554732DNAL7 a10.1515/helm-2017-00462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCamargo, A.

Gut microbiota is involved in the metabolic transformations of dietary components into oncometabolites and tumor-suppressive metabolites that in turn affect CRC development. In a healthy colon, the major of microbial metabolism is saccharolytic fermentation pathways. The alpha-bug hypothesis suggested that oncogenic bacteria such as enterotoxigenic Bacteroides fragilis (ETBF) induce the development of CRC through direct interactions with colonic epithelial cells and alterations of microbiota composition at the colorectal site. Escherichia coli, E. faecalis, F. nucleatum, and Streptococcus gallolyticus showed higher abundance whereas Bifidobacterium, Clostridium, Faecalibacterium, and Roseburia showed reduced abundance in CRC patients. The alterations of gut microbiota may be used as potential therapeutic approaches to prevent or treat CRC. Probiotics such as Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium inhibit the growth of CRC through inhibiting inflammation and angiogenesis and enhancing the function of the intestinal barrier through the secretion of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs). Crosstalk between lifestyle, host genetics, and gut microbiota is well documented in the prevention and treatment of CRC. Future studies are required to understand the interaction between gut microbiota and host to the influence and prevention of CRC. However, a better understanding of bacterial dysbiosis in the heterogeneity of CRC tumors should also be considered. Metatranscriptomic and metaproteomic studies are considered a powerful omic tool to understand the anti-cancer properties of certain bacterial strains. The clinical benefits of probiotics in the CRC context remain to be determined. Metagenomic approaches along with metabolomics and immunology will open a new avenue for the treatment of CRC shortly. Dietary interventions may be suitable to modulate the growth of beneficial microbiota in the gut.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacteroides fragilis 3aBifidobacterium 3aClostridium 3aEscherichia coli 3aLactobacillus 3aRoseburia 3aStreptococcus gallolyticus 3aangiogenesis 3abiotechnology 3acolon 3acolorectal neoplasms 3adysbiosis 3aepithelium 3afermentation 3aimmunology 3ainflammation 3aintestinal microorganisms 3alifestyle 3ametabolites 3ametabolomics 3ametagenomics 3aprobiotics 3asecretion 3atranscriptomics1 aDhar, Ruby1 aPethusamy, Karthikeyan1 aSeethy, Ashikh1 aSrivastava, Tryambak1 aSah, Ramkishor1 aSharma, Jyoti1 aKarmakar, Subhradip1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4757-87290 tApplied biochemistry and biotechnology.g2021 June, v. 193, no. 6 p.1780-1799dSpringer USwJournal:jnl32867x0273-22897nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12010-021-03498-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02476naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002500140245007600165300002000241520116300261592002801424650001601452650001501468650001801483650002401501650002001525650001301545650001901558650002301577650001501600650002201615700001801637700002501655700002601680700002301706700002401729700002401753700003601777700002201813773012401835856007401959852000902033655001202042IND60667258620221119041507.0190919e20150126xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066725862DNAL7 a10.1039/c4ra16852f2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGhoshdastider, Umesh10aMolecular effects of encapsulation of glucose oxidase dimer by graphene  ap. 13570-13578.  aKnowing the nature of the enzyme‚Äìgraphene interface is critical for a design of graphene-based biosensors. Extensive contacts between graphene and enzyme could be obtained by employing a suitable encapsulation which does not impede its enzymatic reaction. We have performed molecular dynamics simulations to obtain an insight on many forms of contact between glucose oxidase dimer and the single-layer graphene nano-sheets. The unconnected graphene sheets tended to form a flat stack regardless of their initial positions around the enzyme, whereas the same graphene sheets linked together formed a flower-like shape engendering different forms of wrapping of the enzyme. During the encapsulation no core hydrophobic residues of the enzyme were exposed. Since the polar and charged amino acids populated the enzyme's surface we also estimated, using DFT calculations, the interaction energies of individual polar and charged amino acid residues with graphene. It was found that the negatively charged residues can bind to graphene unexpectedly strongly; however, the main effect of encapsulation comes from the overlap of adjacent edges of graphene sheets.  aPublisher supplied data 3aamino acids 3abiosensors 3aencapsulation 3aenzymatic reactions 3aglucose oxidase 3agraphene 3ahydrophobicity 3amolecular dynamics 3ananosheets 3asimulation models1 aWu, Rongliang1 aTrzaskowski, Bartosz1 aMlynarczyk, Krzysztof1 aMiszta, Przemyslaw1 aGurusaran, Manickam1 aViswanathan, Sowmya1 aRenugopalakrishnan, Vencatesan,1 aFilipek, Slawomir0 tRSC advances.g2015 Jan. 26, v. 5, no. 18 p.13570-13578dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c4ra16852f3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03115naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245013400169300001600303520195500319592002802274650000902302650002602311650001302337650001102350650001102361650000702372650001502379650001202394650002002406650001602426650001902442700002102461700003502482773009902517856008102616990002302697852000902720655001202729IND60099353720221117223249.0141105e20131201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009935372DNAL7 a10.1016/j.gca.2013.08.0272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSyverson, Drew D.10aExperimental determination of equilibrium Fe isotopic fractionation between pyrite and dissolved Fe under hydrothermal conditions  ap. 170-183.  aFe isotope fractionation between pyrite (FeS‚ÇÇ) and dissolved Fe in NaCl- and sulfur-bearing aqueous fluids was determined under hydrothermal conditions (300‚Äì350¬∞C, 500bars). The data were collected using two different, but complementary, experimental approaches, one involving classical Fe isotope exchange between Fe in pyrite and dissolved Fe in coexisting fluid, while the other involved homogenous precipitation of pyrite in a redox and pH buffered chemical system. Results from these experiments indicate equilibrium Fe isotopic fractionation between pyrite and fluid, Œî‚Åµ‚Å∂FePy·µ£‚ÄìF‚Çë‚Çç‚Çêq‚Çé, of 0.99¬±0.29‚Ä∞ (2œÉ), in ‚Åµ‚Å∂Fe/‚Åµ‚Å¥Fe. The experimentally determined equilibrium pyrite‚Äìfluid Fe isotopic fractionation agrees with theoretical and spectrally-based predictions. The second series of experiments were conducted to better constrain the effect of precipitation rate on the temporal evolution of the Fe isotopic composition of pyrite and Fe bearing fluids in dynamic mixing environments, such as hydrothermal vent sites at mid-ocean ridges. Rapid homogenous precipitation of pyrite at 300 and 350¬∞C indicates that Œ¥‚Åµ‚Å∂Fe of dissolved Fe is significantly greater than pyrite that formed during the earliest stage of the experiment, possibly facilitated by either equilibrium or kinetic isotope effects involving FeS as a reactant during pyrite formation. Subsequent recrystallization of pyrite results in a Fe isotopic fractionation with dissolved Fe that moves towards the experimentally determined equilibrium Fe isotopic fractionation with reaction progress. The experimental data reported here may help to decipher the complex kinetic and thermodynamic processes involved in pyrite formation at deep sea vents, while also providing constraints for the rapidly developing theoretical models used to estimate equilibrium Fe isotope fractionation between pyrite and fluid at elevated temperatures and pressures.  aPublisher supplied data 3airon 3aisotope fractionation 3aisotopes 3amixing 3amodels 3apH 3aprediction 3apyrites 3asodium chloride 3atemperature 3athermodynamics1 aBorrok, David M.1 aSeyfried, William E., Jr.cJr.0 tGeochimica et cosmochimica acta.g2013 Dec. 1, v. 122 p.170-183dElsevier Ltdx0016-70377nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gca.2013.08.0273Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02487naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001400142245015700156300002000313520130800333592002801641650001101669650001101680650001301691650001301704700001901717700001701736700006101753700005601814700005701870773014901927856007602076852000902152655001202161IND60748890120221118033652.0210827e20210810xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074889012DNAL7 a10.1021/jacs.1c052082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Siqi10aPrecise Introduction of the ‚àíCH‚ÇôX‚ÇÉ‚Äì‚Çô (X = F, Cl, Br, I) Moiety to Target Molecules by a Radical Strategy: A Theoretical and Experimental Study  ap. 13195-13204.  aAddition of halomethyl radicals to form bioactive molecules has recently become an efficient strategy. The reaction has a bottleneck, however, which is the effective and selective generation of the proper halomethyl ‚Ä¢CH‚ÇôX‚ÇÉ‚Äì‚Çô radical by combining CH‚ÇôX‚ÇÑ‚Äì‚Çô with a carbon radical. Understanding the reactivity and selectivity of carbon radicals in the hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) and halogen atom transfer (XAT) reactions of CH‚ÇôX‚ÇÑ‚Äì‚Çô is key to the development of such an attractive method. With the help of the emerging data-driven strategy, DFT calculations were used to explore various correlations. For selectivity, the relative energy barriers between HAT and XAT reactions (ŒîG‚ßßH ‚Äì ŒîG‚ßßX) correlate reasonably well with the three parameters ŒîGH, ŒîGX, and IP, and the correlation studies reveal that the calculated IP·µ¢‚Çô·µ•‚Çë·µ£ and the experimental ŒîBDE can be used to conveniently predict the selectivity. Predicted selectivities are consistent with experimental determinations. This work not only provides a possibility for selecting carbon radicals with the known or easily obtained physicochemical data but also demonstrates that the informatic workflow such as generating data and identifying correlations has potential applications in mining reaction rules.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3aenergy 3ahydrogen 3amoieties1 aSu, Yong-Liang1 aSun, Tian-Yu1 aDoyle, Michael P.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1386-37801 aWu, Yun-Dong1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4477-73321 aZhang, Xinhao1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8210-25310 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2021 Aug. 10, v. 143, no. 33 p.13195-13204dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19166x1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jacs.1c052083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02652naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001800152245014000170300001600310520108800326592002801414650002201442650001801464650001801482650001901500650002301519650001901542650002101561650002401582650002601606650001101632650001501643650001301658650001501671653002501686653002501711653002601736653002001762653003601782700001701818700001401835700001701849700001901866700001701885700001301902700001701915773010601932856008702038852000902125655001202134IND60584873020221117060315.0200509e201802  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058487302DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2017.10.0682doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPeng, Xinhong10aAccelerated removal of high concentration p-chloronitrobenzene using bioelectrocatalysis process and its microbial communities analysis  ap. 844-850.  ap-Chloronitrobenzene (p-CNB) is a persistent refractory and toxic pollutant with a concentration up to 200‚ÄØmg/L in industrial wastewater.

The LDBCs were prepared by the respective addition reaction of a hydrophilic poly(oxyalkylene)amine with hydrophobic dendrons of various generations based on 4-isocyanate-4‚Ä≤-(3,3-dimethyl-2,4-dioxo-azetidine)-diphenylmethane (IDD). The dendrons having polyurea/malonamide functionalities were synthesized by using IDD as a building block. Moreover, the dendrons comprised not only hydrogen bond-rich malonamide linkages, but long alkyl chains at the peripheries as well. XGS were respectively grafted with these amphiphilic LDBCs to afford XGS-dendritic derivatives (XGS-G0.5, XGS-G1.5, and XGS-G2.5). Subsequently, a nanohybrid, XGS-G2.5/AgNPs was obtained through the reduction of Ag‚Å∫ on the surface of LDBC modified XGS. The dendrons would serve as the effective templates for hosting AgNPs. By the incorporation of XGS-G2.5/AgNPs nanohybrid, it rendered the PSC an increased power conversion efficient (PCE) to 4.04%, a 19.5% improvement over a PCE of 3.38% for the bare inverted PSC, due to the localized surface plasmon resonance of AgNPs, and the improvement of compatibility and charge transfer capacity between ZnO based cathode and photoactive layer.  aPublisher supplied data 3acathodes 3achemical reduction 3acomposite polymers 3afullerene 3agraphene 3ahydrogen 3ahydrophilicity 3ahydrophobicity 3ananohybrids 3ananosheets 3ananosilver 3asilver 3asolar cells 3asurface plasmon resonance 3azinc oxide1 aLin, Wei-Chen1 aWang, Hsing-Ju1 aLee, Wan-Hua1 aLee, Rong-Ho1 aDai, Shenghong A.1 aHsieh, Chi-Fa1 aJeng, Ru-Jong0 tRSC advances.g2015 Mar. 09, v. 5, no. 32 p.25192-25203dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c4ra16855k3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03710naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100006000149245019400209520210800403592002802511650001302539650001702552650001302569650002502582650003502607650001602642650002702658650001102685650002202696650001602718650001502734650001302749650001402762650001102776650003502787650002402822650001702846650001502863650002002878650001502898651001302913653000902926653001402935653000802949653001202957700002202969773010802991856008403099852000903183655001203192IND60739298420221122054730.0210904e202108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073929842DNAL7 a10.1016/j.rsase.2021.1005442doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMakonyo, Michael1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2124-157810aIdentification of groundwater potential recharge zones using GIS-based multi-criteria decision analysis: A case study of semi-arid midlands Manyara fractured aquifer, North-Eastern Tanzania  aThe extraction of groundwater has recently increased due to water scarcity as a result of human activities including agriculture, industrial and domestic use. This has accelerated the need to spatially identify groundwater potential zones for artificial aquifer recharge and extraction through boreholes drilling. The current study is aimed at identifying groundwater potential recharge zones (GPRZ) of semi-arid midlands Manyara fractured aquifer using Geographic Information System (GIS) and Multi-criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) based on Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) technique. The study area solely depends on groundwater for human survival through deep and shallow boreholes water extraction. Eight influencing factors including aquifer lithology, slopes, land use/land cover (LULC), soil types, drainage density, geological lineament density, flow accumulation, and topographic wetness index (TWI) were determined and reclassified on a scale of 1‚Äì5 in ArcGIS 10.6 environments. These factors were weighted with the help of AHP and integrated with ArcGIS pro based on the weighted linear combination (WLC) method. The results were scaled into five recharge potential classes; very high, high, moderate, low, and very low recharge potential zones. The results indicates that about 1607¬†km¬≤ (14.7%) of the study area is under very high potential recharge zones, 3982¬†km¬≤ (36.43%) falls under high recharge zones, 3120¬†km¬≤ (28.55%) moderate, 1658¬†km¬≤ (15.17%) low and 562¬†km¬≤ (5.14%) under very low recharge zone. To assess the accuracy of the result a total of 66 boreholes collected from the field were used and the Receiver Operator Characteristics (ROC) curve generated. The area under the curve (AUC) was found to be 78% signifying moderate to higher accuracy of the model.

Lipid content was found to affect the bioaccumulation of Œ£HBCD and Œ£TBECH in these species. Elevated biomagnification of each diastereomer from prey species to marine mammals was observed. For HBCD, biota samples showed a shift from Œ≥- to Œ±-HBCD when compared with sediments and technical mixtures; trophic magnification potential of (‚àí)-Œ±- and (+)-Œ±-HBCD were observed in the food web, with trophic magnification factors (TMFs) of 11.8 and 8.7, respectively. For TBECH, the relative abundance of Œ≥- and Œ¥-TBECH exhibited an increasing trend from abiotic matrices to biota samples; trophic magnification was observed for each diastereomer, with TMFs ranging from 1.9 to 3.5. The enantioselective bioaccumulation of the first eluting enantiomer of Œ¥-TBECH in organisms at higher TLs was consistently observed across samples. This is the first report on the trophic transfer of TBECH in the food web. The estimated daily intake of HBCD for Hong Kong residents was approximately 16-times higher than that for the general population in China, and the health risk to local children was high, based on the relevant available reference dose.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaquatic food webs 3aaverage daily intake 3abioaccumulation 3achildren 3adiastereomers 3aenantiomers 3aenantioselectivity 3ahexabromocyclododecane 3ahumans 3alipid content 3amarine ecosystems 3amarine mammals 3aprey species 3arisk 3asediments 3aChina1 aZhang, Xiaohua1 aQiu, Jian-Wen1 aLeung, Kenneth M.

Among them, poly(2,6-dimethyl-1,4-phenylene oxide) with pendant quaternary ammonium (PPO-QA) is one of the most promising. PPO-QA membranes with flexible alkyl side-chains of varying lengths as a spacer (or extender) for QA have been studied and shown to have different performances; however, the exact underlying mechanisms have remained unclear. We study PPO-QA membranes with varying alkyl side-chains (n = 0, 6, 10, and 16 carbon atoms) with a constant QA position (near the backbone), and with the same side-chain length (n = 16) and varying QA positions on it: near the polymer backbone, in the middle, and at the end of the pendant side-chain, by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The calculated water diffusion coefficient in the membranes is in full agreement with experimental data. Our study on membranes with varying alkyl side-chain lengths and a constant QA position at different hydration levels shows a consistent and quantitative correlation between the anion diffusion coefficient (D‚Çê) and the hydrophilic pathway morphology. Also, at constant hydration, D‚Çê is considerably enhanced due to moving the QA position towards the end of the alkyl side-chain. However, we show that this enhancement is not due to morphological changes in the hydrophilic pathway or polymer phase. Still, the underlying mechanism is the enhanced mobility of QA, plus a lower residence time of anions close to QA. We show that the morphology of the membrane and the degree of phase separation between the hydrophobic/hydrophilic parts is almost constant, but the QA at the end of the alkyl side-chain is considerably easier to pull towards the water channels; therefore, its increased mobility and hydration result in the enhanced dynamics of the diffusing anion. Lastly, we introduce a new methodology to assess the correlation between membrane structure and ion transport rate for fuel cell membranes so that one can tune the permeation of ions (or other molecules) by two distinct mechanisms: (i) by controlling the hydrophilic pathway morphology by changing the polymer backbone structure, which determines the permeation according to the size of the diffusing moieties, and (ii) by side-chain modification, which enhances QA mobility and accordingly (selectively) increases the ion diffusion rate. We show that our methodology could successfully explain how the side-chain modification for PPO-QA membranes considerably increases the ion permeation while the methanol cross-over remains constant.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanion exchange 3acarbon 3acation exchange 3adiffusivity 3afuel cells 3afuels 3ahydrophilicity 3ahydrophobicity 3amethanol 3amethodology 3amolecular dynamics 3apermeability 3apolymers 3aquaternary ammonium compounds 3aseparation1 aSharif, Farhad1 aMakki, Hesam0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2022 Sept. 13, v. 10, no. 35 p.18295-18307dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d2ta04400e3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04376naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002100155245011800176300001600294520257000310592002802880650002202908650001502930650002402945650001602969650002202985650002503007650001303032650001203045650001603057650002503073650001503098650000903113650001203122650002803134650001603162650001703178650001503195650001403210650001303224650001503237650001503252650002103267650001203288650003103300650001803331650002103349650002003370650001103390650001403401653002103415653001603436653002503452653001503477700002103492700002703513773009903540856009003639852000903729655001203738IND60532162120221122121922.0190318e20161101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053216212DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aquaculture.2016.07.0212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCarboni, Stefano14aThe use of biorefinery by-products and natural detritus as feed sources for oysters (Crassostrea gigas) juveniles  ap. 392-398.  aNew research is currently underway to explore the potential of macroalgae for the production of biofuels. Marine biofuels in general and macroalgae in particular, offer a number of advantages over terrestrial biofuels including reduced competition for freshwater resources and for land use. Sugars can be extracted from macroalgae and processed into biofuels by anaerobic digestion and fermentation. This process generates significant waste biomass, which, if used, could improve the economic sustainability of the biorefinery sector. Bivalves' aquaculture relies heavily on the production of unicellular algae to feed juvenile individuals and this can represent a bottleneck for the bivalve industry especially in locations where sunlight is limited. Previous research explored the use of macroalgae derived digestate as alternative or integrative feed for juvenile bivalves, exploiting the notion that organic particulate matter (detritus) is an integral part of this animal class natural diet. The prospect of using waste products from the emerging biorefinery industry to solve a bottleneck for aquaculture businesses and, by so doing, improving profitability of both, is an exciting one. In this paper we describe the main nutritional profiles (Protein, Lipid, Carbohydrates and Fatty acids) of the tested diets and investigate the potential for the use of a biorefinery a by-product as replacement option for bivalves' production, by benchmarking it against aquaculture industry standards (live microalgae and commercially available algae paste) and natural detritus constituted by farmed sea urchin digesta. Both the digestate and the natural detritus supported the survival and growth of bivalve spat, especially when used at 50% inclusion rate, over the course of 4-week preliminary trials. Data suggest that a synergistic effect of the nutritional profiles of the diets employed may underpin the observed results.With this study we compare the biochemical composition and suitability as oyster feed of the Single Cell Detritus produced by S. latissima enzymatic saccharification and natural detritus produced by sea urchin digestive action, with live microalgae as well as commercial algae paste. A comparison between biochemical composition and suitability as aquaculture feed between biorefinery by-products and natural detritus was, to our knowledge, lacking.Results indicate that both the digestate and the natural detritus supported the survival and growth of oyster spat, especially when used at 50% inclusion rate, over the course of 4-weeks trial.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCrassostrea gigas 3aEchinoidea 3aanaerobic digestion 3aaquaculture 3aaquaculture feeds 3aaquaculture industry 3abiofuels 3abiomass 3abiorefining 3abusiness enterprises 3abyproducts 3adiet 3adigesta 3aeconomic sustainability 3afatty acids 3afermentation 3afreshwater 3ajuveniles 3aland use 3amacroalgae 3amicroalgae 3anutrient content 3aoysters 3aparticulate organic matter 3aprofitability 3asaccharification 3asolar radiation 3asugars 3asynergism 0aOyster nutrition 0aBiorefinery 0aSingle cell detritus 0aSea urchin1 aClegg, Samuel H.1 aHughes, A.q(Adam D.),0 tAquaculture.g2016 Nov. 01, v. 464 p.392-398dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl59663x0044-84867nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaculture.2016.07.0213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01602naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002000140245009100160300001800251520053600269592002800805650001100833650002200844650002300866650002000889650004400909650001700953650001400970650001300984700002300997700002801020773013301048856007401181852000901255655001201264IND60660852420221123022900.0190827e20150303xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066085242DNAL7 a10.1039/c4cc10108a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHavel, V√°clav,10aReal-time analysis of multiple anion mixtures in aqueous media using a single receptor  ap. 4666-4669.  aBambusuril-based receptors have been used in conjunction with ¬πH NMR spectroscopy to recognize mixtures of inorganic anions in aqueous solutions.

Bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) shows promise as an easy to use, rapid, and non-invasive tool to evaluate body composition. The objectives of this study were to: (a) develop BIA prediction equations to estimate total body water (TBW) and fat-free mass (FFM) in European children and early adolescents and to validate the analysis with the deuterium dilution as the reference technique and (b) compare our results with previously published paediatric BIA equations.¬†The cohort included 266 healthy children and adolescents between 7 and 14 years of age, 46% girls, in five European countries: Bosnia and Herzegovina, Latvia, Montenegro, North Macedonia, and Portugal. TBW and FFM were the target variables in the developed regression models. For model development, the dataset was randomly split into training and test sets, in 70:30 ratio, respectively. Model tuning was performed with 10-fold cross-validation that confirmed the unbiased estimate of its performance. The final regression models were retrained on the whole dataset.¬†Cross-validated regression models were developed using resistance index, weight, and sex as the optimal predictors. The new prediction equations explained 87% variability in both TBW and FFM. Limits of agreement between BIA and reference values, were within ¬±17% of the mean, (‚àí3.4, 3.7) and (‚àí4.5, 4.8) kg for TBW and FFM, respectively. BIA FFM and TBW estimates were within one standard deviation for approximately 83% of the children. BIA prediction equations underestimated TBW and FFM by 0.2¬†kg and 0.1¬†kg respectively with no proportional bias and comparable accuracy among different BMI-for-age subgroups. Comparison with predictive equations from published studies revealed varying discrepancy rates with the deuterium dilution measurements, with only two being equivalent to the equations developed in this study.¬†The small difference between deuterium dilution and BIA measurements validated by Bland‚ÄìAltman analysis, supports the application of BIA for epidemiological studies in European children using the developed equations.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abioelectrical impedance 3abody water 3achildhood 3aclinical nutrition 3adata collection 3adeuterium 3alean body mass 3aobesity 3aprediction 3astandard deviation 3aBosnia-Herzegovina 3aLatvia 3aMontenegro 3aPortugal 3aRepublic of North Macedonia 0aBody composition 0aBioelectrical impedance analysis 0aDeuterium dilution 0aChildren1 aGrujic, Vesna Rudic1 aGrabez, Milkica1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7770-62931 aVidic, Alfred1 aSiksna, Inese1 aLazda, Ilva1 aBajiƒá, Borko1 aƒêuroviƒá, Dijana1 aSpiroski, Igor1 aDimitrovska, Maja1 aRito, Ana1 aMendes, Sofia1 aK√¶stel, Pernille1 aWard, Leigh C.0 tClinical nutrition ESPEN.g2021 Aug., v. 44 p.402-409dElsevier LtdwJournal:23538x2405-45777nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.clnesp.2021.05.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02631naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002700111040001800138100004800156245011600204300001800320520090400338592002801242650001501270650001601285650002701301650001801328650001401346650001801360650003101378650001201409650002201421650001901443650002601462650004401488650002401532650002601556653002201582653001501604653002501619653001601644653002201660653001801682700002801700700002001728700002801748700002601776700002901802700002701831773014701858852000902005856007502014655001202089IND4463147920160905000000.0160905e20120215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446314792DNAL7 a222293472pmid7 a10.1021/jf204111t2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSoares, Fabiana

Palm stearin, coconut oil, and canola oil were used as substrates for chemical interesterification. The main aim of the present study was to evaluate the physicochemical properties of blends of palm stearin, coconut oil, and canola oil submitted to chemical interesterification using sodium methoxide as the catalyst. The original and interesterified blends were examined for fatty acid composition, softening and melting points, solid fat content, and consistency. Chemical interesterification reduced softening and melting points, consistency, and solid fat content. The interesterified fats showed desirable physicochemical properties for possible use as a margarine. Therefore, our result suggested that the interesterified fat without trans-fatty acids could be used as an alternative to partially hydrogenated fat.  aPublisher supplied data 3acanola oil 3acoconut oil 3afatty acid composition 3alipid content 3amargarine 3amelting point 3aphysicochemical properties 3astearin 3atrans fatty acids 2aEsterification 2aFatty Acidsxanalysis 2aFatty Acids, Monounsaturatedxchemistry 2aChemical Phenomena. 2aPlant Oilsxchemistry 0aeutectic behavior 0avalidation 0amultiple regressions 0aconsistency 0asolid fat content 0amelting point1 ada Silva, Roberta Claro1 aHazzan, M√°rcia1 aCapacla, Isabele Renata1 aViccola, Elise Raduan1 aMaruyama, Jessica Mayumi1 aGioielli, Luiz Antonio0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2012 Feb. 15, v. 60, no. 6 p.1461-1469dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:12177x1520-51187nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fjf204111t3Available from publisher's site 7aarticle02698naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001400148245007900162300001600241500001900257520163400276592002801910650002301938650002001961650001001981650001901991650001702010650001202027650002902039651001002068700001602078700002202094773014102116856008202257852000902339655001202348IND60733701820221120232124.0210410e202103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073370182DNAL7 a10.1007/s12524-020-01243-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHarshit, 10aAnalysis of Survey Approach Using UAV Images and Lidar for a Chimney Study  ap. 613-618.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aUAVs for aerial photography have been promoted as the new way to map large areas efficiently. The cost of the technology is comparable to that of GNSS survey, and the results are comparable with much greater resolution. This is a major leap forward. The objective of this paper is to analyze the survey methodologies using a Lidar- and UAV-based photogrammetry and compare an overall approach over a chimney study. The whole analysis is done for a chimney under construction at Qasimpur, Harduaganj in Aligarh district in the Indian state of Uttar Pradesh. Chimney is one of the prominent structures in any thermal power plant, and its stability is really an issue for which conventionally total station and other instruments were used. The primary function of chimney is to discharge pollutants into atmosphere at such heights and velocities that the concentration of pollutants deemed harmful to the environment is kept within acceptable limits at ground level. Due to the development in unmanned aerial systems, survey has become quite accurate and accessible. Nowadays, it has been possible to study the structure more in detail and critical analysis can also be done using the point cloud data of the structure. Creation of mesh surface using these point cloud can be used to identify the undulation and defects in structure. In this paper, both UAV images and Lidar data are used to analyze the same structure from two different perspectives. Computing eccentricity of the structure using these two methodologies is further compared for accuracy, and an effort is made to understand the practicality of both survey methods.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaerial photography 3adata collection 3alidar 3aphotogrammetry 3apower plants 3asurveys 3aunmanned aerial vehicles 3aIndia1 aJain, Kamal1 aMishra, Vaishnavi0 tJournal of the Indian Society of Remote Sensing.g2021 Mar., v. 49, no. 3 p.613-618dSpringer IndiawJournal:J000001231x0255-660X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12524-020-01243-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02124naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100006600150245011700216300001600333520095800349592002801307650002301335650001901358650001801377650001301395650002201408653001301430653000801443653000801451653001601459653001401475700003101489773016001520856008501680852000901765655001201774IND60739298620221120153909.0220706e202108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073929862DNAL7 a10.1016/j.clnesp.2021.05.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDelpino, Felipe Mendes1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3562-324610aSupplementation with omega-3 and lean body mass in the general population: A systematic review and meta-analysis  ap. 105-113.  aResults from narrative reviews showed potential from omega-3 supplementation on lean body mass.

Small waterbodies are freshwater habitats to many species, including amphibians, that are vulnerable to MP pollution. This study analyzed the distribution and characteristics of MPs in 25 small waterbodies from the Yangtze River Delta, China. MPs were detected in surface water, sediment, and tadpoles with abundances ranging from 0.48 to 21.52 items L‚Äì¬π, 35.76 to 3185.33 items kg‚Äì¬π, and 0 to 2.73 items individual‚Äì¬π (0 to 168.48 items g‚Äì¬π), respectively. The dominant shape and polymer of MPs in water and tadpole samples were polyester (PES) fibers, and polypropylene (PP) fibers and fragments were dominant in sediment samples. In addition, MPs were primarily <0.5 mm in length in all samples. Tadpole length was positively correlated to the number of MPs detected. The abundance, shape, and polymer distribution of MPs in tadpoles resembled that of water rather than sediment, suggesting that tadpoles likely take up MPs from the surrounding water. This study demonstrated that MPs are abundant in these small waterbodies and are ingested by resident tadpoles. This may suggest a pathway of MP entry into aquatic and terrestrial food webs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aamphibians 3afreshwater 3ahabitats 3aplastics 3apollution 3apolyesters 3apolypropylenes 3ariver deltas 3asediments 3asoil food webs 3asurface water 3atadpoles 3aterrestrial ecosystems 3aChina 3aYangtze River1 aChernick, Melissa1 aHinton, David E.1 aShi, Huahong1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2978-06800 tEnvironmental science & technology.g2018 July 23, v. 52, no. 15 p.8885-8893dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23339x1520-58517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.8b022793Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02270naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002300094024002200117024001900139040001800158100002400176245011500200300001500315520082500330592002801155650001301183650001001196650001701206650001401223650001401237650001101251650002001262650002001282650001001302650001801312650001001330700002201340700002001362700001901382700002101401700003301422773015201455856007001607856010301677990002301780852000901803655001201812IND60608537220221119195641.0190510e20170413xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060853722DNAL7 a10.3791/555112doi7 aPMC55646892pmcid7 a284479992pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBjarkam, Carsten R.10aExposure of the pig cns for histological analysis: a manual for decapitation, skull opening, and brain removal  ap. e55511.  aPigs have become increasingly popular in large-animal translational neuroscience research as an economically and ethically feasible substitute to non-human primates. The large brain size of the pig allows the use of conventional clinical brain imagers and the direct use and testing of neurosurgical procedures and equipment from the human clinic. Further macroscopic and histological analysis, however, requires postmortem exposure of the pig central nervous system (CNS) and subsequent brain removal. This is not an easy task, as the pig CNS is encapsulated by a thick, bony skull and spinal column. The goal of this paper and instructional video is to describe how to expose and remove the postmortem pig brain and the pituitary gland in an intact state, suitable for subsequent macroscopic and histological analysis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPrimates 3abrain 3adecapitation 3aequipment 3ahistology 3ahumans 3aneurophysiology 3apituitary gland 3askull 3aspine (bones) 3aswine1 aOrlowski, Dariusz1 aTvilling, Laura1 aBech, Johannes1 aGlud, Andreas N.1 aS√∏rensen, Jens-Christian H.0 tJournal of visualized experiments.g2017 Apr. 13, , no. 122 p.e55511-e55511dJournal of Visualized ExperimentswJournal:jnl4469330x1940-087X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3791/555113Available from publisher's site  uhttp://www.jove.com/video/55511/exposure-pig-cns-for-histological-analysis-manual-for-decapitation  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03889naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245011500169300001600284520209300300592002802393650002402421650002402445650001102469650001202480650001102492650001902503650001802522650002202540650001802562650002302580650001902603650001602622650001102638650002002649650002002669650002402689650001502713650001902728650002902747650000902776650001102785650001302796650001202809650002302821650002802844651001902872653001902891653002802910653001102938653002402949700002302973700001802996700002703014700001403041773011303055856008603168852000903254655001203263IND60586250620221121063926.0200712e20180210xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058625062DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2017.11.0182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPurdy, Andrew10aTowards sustainable farming: Feasibility study into energy recovery from bio-waste on a small-scale dairy farm  ap. 899-904.  aAnaerobic digestion (AD) of farm biomass is growing importance as it offers environmental benefits and the biogas produced from AD which can be used as fuel for co-generation of heat and electricity. The study aimed to explore the viability of energy recovery from bio-waste on a small-scale dairy farm to produce biogas using AD and the gas used as biofuel to fuel a combined heat and power (CHP) which generated electrical power and heat for the farm. The AD and the CHP system was designed and simulated using ECLIPSE software. Various ages of cow manure were sampled, analysed and used as an AD feedstock and it was found that as cow manure aged the amount biogas produced from anaerobic digestion was decreased; a reduction in biogas production of 5.76% was found over two months, and in the subsequent two months the reduction rate was found to accelerate, leading to a 16.92% reduction after four months. It was found that 1¬†t fresh manure as the feedstock produced 58.6¬†m¬≥ of biogas. That means cow manure should be used as an AD feedstock as soon as possible, as carbon lost in the form of methane (CH‚ÇÑ) occurs naturally in the atmosphere, accelerating over time. The rate of CH‚ÇÑ emission is increased by 3 fold (i.e. 21,196¬†kg per year) if the annual manure mass is left uncovered for four month. Early insertion of fresh manure into an anaerobic digester can significantly increase biogas production and subsequently reduce emissions of CH‚ÇÑ, which has a global warming potential (GWP) of twenty-five times that of carbon dioxide (CO‚ÇÇ). The simulation results indicated that enough energy can be recovered from the quantity of cow manure available on the farm to provide the electrical and heating energy demands of the farmyard and the attached dwellings, thus creating a sustainable farming system. In combination with the environmental benefits, it was determined that a substantial annual revenue could be generated from utility bill savings and current favourable incentive rates available to promote renewable energy technologies in farming industry in the UK.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanaerobic digesters 3aanaerobic digestion 3abiogas 3abiomass 3acarbon 3acarbon dioxide 3acattle manure 3acomputer software 3adairy farming 3aecosystem services 3aelectric power 3aelectricity 3aenergy 3aenergy recovery 3afarming systems 3afeasibility studies 3afeedstocks 3aglobal warming 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3aheat 3aincome 3aindustry 3amethane 3amethane production 3asustainable agriculture 3aUnited Kingdom 0aFarm bio-waste 0aCombined heat and power 0aBiogas 0aAnaerobic digestion1 aPathare, Pankaj B.1 aWang, Yaodong1 aRoskilly, Anthony Paul1 aHuang, Ye0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2018 Feb. 10, v. 174 p.899-904dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2017.11.0183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02024naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245018100158300002000339520093300359592002801292650001401320700001601334700001801350700001701368700001801385700001501403700001601418700001501434700001601449700001401465773012401479856007401603852000901677655001201686IND60666842720221120093200.0190919e20141023xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066684272DNAL7 a10.1039/c4ra08951k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Fenggang10aComparison of second-order nonlinear optical chromophores with D‚ÄìœÄ‚ÄìA, D‚ÄìA‚ÄìœÄ‚ÄìA and D‚ÄìD‚ÄìœÄ‚ÄìA architectures: diverse NLO effects and interesting optical behavior  ap. 52991-52999.  aFour second-order nonlinear optical chromophores with D‚ÄìœÄ‚ÄìA, D‚ÄìA‚ÄìœÄ‚ÄìA and D‚ÄìD‚ÄìœÄ‚ÄìA architectures have been synthesized and systematically characterized. Chromophores A and C have been synthesized with an additional acceptor (‚ÄìCN) or donor group (thiophene) on the œÄ bridge, termed the D‚ÄìA‚ÄìœÄ‚ÄìA and D‚ÄìD‚ÄìœÄ‚ÄìA configurations. D‚ÄìœÄ‚ÄìA structural chromophores B and D were chosen as reference compounds for comparison. The results show that incorporation of the ‚ÄìCN group could increase poling efficiency possibly due to reduced intermolecular dipole‚Äìdipole interactions which results in comparable r‚ÇÉ‚ÇÉ values (48 pm V‚Åª¬π). An r‚ÇÉ‚ÇÉ value of 45 pm V‚Åª¬π was obtained for the film C/APC suggesting significant site isolation. Compared with the D‚ÄìœÄ‚ÄìA structural chromophores B and D, chromophores A and C demonstrated similar or enhanced NLO effects and better optical transparency.  aPublisher supplied data 3athiophene1 aYang, Yuhui1 aCong, Shengyu1 aWang, Haoran1 aJing, Qinghe,1 aBo, Shuhui1 aLiu, Jialei1 aZhen, Zhen1 aLiu, Xinhou1 aQiu, Ling0 tRSC advances.g2014 Oct. 23, v. 4, no. 95 p.52991-52999dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c4ra08951k3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01559naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002100139245009500160300001600255520054800271592002800819650003600847650001700883650001100900650001200911650001900923700002600942700001800968700002300986773015201009856007501161852000901236655001201245IND60549368720170925000000.0160908e20120525xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054936872DNAL7 a10.1021/np200645p2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLe√≥n, Alejandra10aEnantiomeric Derivatives of Tokinolide B: Absolute Configuration and Biological Properties  ap. 859-864.  aThe enantiomeric lactams (‚àí)-8, (+)-8, (+)-9, and (‚àí)-9 were formed by the reaction of the dimeric phthalide rac-tokinolide B (rac-3) with (R)-(+)-Œ±-methylbenzylamine and (S)-(‚àí)-Œ±-methylbenzylamine.

To assess the suitability for clinical use of commercially available ANP assays, intra-assay and inter-assay coefficient of variation and dilution parallelism were calculated for three immunoassays (RIAPen, RIAPhoen, and an ELISAPen) using blood samples from healthy and diseased horses to cover a wide range of ANP concentrations. Further, agreement between assays was assessed using linear regression and Bland‚ÄìAltman analyses. For all assays, precision was moderate but acceptable and dilution parallelism was good. All assays showed analytic performance similar to other immunoassays used in veterinary medicine. However, the results from the three assays were poorly comparable. Our study highlights the need for an optimised species-specific assay for equine samples.  aPublisher supplied data 3ablood sampling 3aheart diseases 3ahorses 3aimmunoassays 3alinear models 3anatriuretic peptides 3aveterinary medicine 0aAB 0aAG 0aANP 0aBNP 0aCV 0aNT-proBNP 0aELISA 0aRIA 0aAccuracy 0aPrecision 0aBiomarker 0aCardiac 0aEquine1 aSchwarzwald, C.C.1 aGrenacher, B.1 aWeishaupt, M.A.0 tResearch in veterinary science.g2014 Feb., v. 96, no. 1 p.180-186dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl45491x0034-52887nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rvsc.2013.10.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03232naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245014100170300001600311520182200327592002802149650002902177650001302206650001902219650001702238650001702255650001002272650001802282650001602300650002702316650003202343650002602375650002302401650001802424650002102442650002802463650002502491700002102516700002302537700003102560773010402591856008202695852000902777655001202786IND60517782120221119221551.0200126e201605  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051778212DNAL7 a10.1007/s00709-015-0849-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSrikanth, Koigoora10aEvaluation of cytotoxicity, morphological alterations and oxidative stress in Chinook salmon cells exposed to copper oxide nanoparticles  ap. 873-884.  aThe current study is aimed to study cytotoxicity and oxidative stress mediated changes induced by copper oxide nanoparticles (CuO NPs) in Chinook salmon cells (CHSE-214). To this end, a number of biochemical responses are evaluated in CHSE-214 cells which are as follows [3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazoliumbromide] MTT, neutral red uptake (NRU), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), protein carbonyl (PC), lipid peroxidation (LPO), oxidised glutathione (GSSG), reduced glutathione (GSH), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), glutathione sulfo-transferase (GST), superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), 8-Hydroxy-2‚Ä≤-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) and reactive oxygen species (ROS), respectively. The 50¬†% inhibition concentration (IC‚ÇÖ‚ÇÄ) of CuO NPs to CHSE-214 cells after 24¬†h exposure was found to be 19.026¬†Œºg¬†ml‚Åª¬π. Viability of cells was reduced by CuO NPs, and the decrease was dose dependent as revealed by the MTT and NRU assay. CHSE-214 cells exposed to CuO NPs induced morphological changes. Initially, cells started to detach from the surface (12¬†h), followed by polyhedric, fusiform appearance (19¬†h) and finally the cells started to shrink. Later, the cells started losing their cellular contents leading to their death only after 24¬†h. LDH, PC, LPO, GSH, GPx, GST, SOD, CAT, 8-OHdG and ROS responses were seen significantly increased with the increase in the concentration of CuO NPs when compared to their respective controls. However, significant decrease in GSSG was perceptible in CHSE-214 cells exposed to CuO NPs in a dose-dependent manner. Our data demonstrated that CuO NPs induced cytotoxicity in CHSE-214 cells through the mediation of oxidative stress. The current study provides a baseline for the CuO NPs-mediated cytotoxic assessment in CHSE-214 cells for the future studies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOncorhynchus tshawytscha 3acatalase 3acell viability 3acupric oxide 3acytotoxicity 3adeath 3adose response 3aglutathione 3aglutathione peroxidase 3ainhibitory concentration 50 3alactate dehydrogenase 3alipid peroxidation 3ananoparticles 3aoxidative stress 3areactive oxygen species 3asuperoxide dismutase1 aPereira, Eduarda1 aDuarte, Armando C.1 aRao, Janapala Venkateswara0 tProtoplasma.g2016 May, v. 253, no. 3 p.873-884dSpringer ViennawJournal:jnl44608x0033-183X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00709-015-0849-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02255naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003500135040001800170100007000188245008100258300001600339500001100355506007600366520099700442592002801439506003701467650000901504650002301513650001301536650001301549650001601562700002001578700001901598700003501617700002401652773010201676856008201778852000901860655001201869IND60572428220221207085227.0210908e201705  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057242822DNAL7 a278784482pmid7 aPMC53856642pmcid7 a10.1007/s13280-016-0844-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMatias, Denise Margaret S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6047-117612aA review of ecosystem service benefits from wild bees across social contexts  ap. 456-467.  aReview  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aIn order to understand the role of wild bees in both social and ecological systems, we conducted a quantitative and qualitative review of publications dealing with wild bees and the benefits they provide in social contexts. We classified publications according to several attributes such as services and benefits derived from wild bees, types of bee‚Äìhuman interactions, recipients of direct benefits, social contexts where wild bees are found, and sources of changes to the bee‚Äìhuman system. We found that most of the services and benefits from wild bees are related to food, medicine, and pollination. We also found that wild bees directly provide benefits to communities to a greater extent than individuals. In the social contexts where they are found, wild bees occupy a central role. Several drivers of change affect bee‚Äìhuman systems, ranging from environmental to political drivers. These are the areas where we recommend making interventions for conserving the bee-human system.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abees 3aecosystem services 3amedicine 3apolitics 3apollination1 aLeventon, Julia1 aRau, Anna-Lena1 aBorgemeister, C.q(Christian),1 avon Wehrden, Henrik0 tAmbio.g2017 May, v. 46, no. 4 p.456-467dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl28633x0044-74477nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13280-016-0844-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03417naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002400140245017300164300001800337500002000355520197600375592002802351596006102379596004802440650002302488650002102511650002502532650001002557650002402567650001602591650001202607650001402619650001602633650002202649650001402671650001302685651001202698700001702710700005902727773011302786856007502899852000902974655001202983IND60786743120221119165344.0220805e202105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078674312DNAL7 a10.1002/csc2.204772doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aErfatpour, Mohammad10aInvestigations of the effects of the non‚Äêdarkening seed coat trait coded by the recessive jj alleles on agronomic, sensory, and cooking characteristics in pinto beans  ap. 1843-1863.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe beige background of the conventional pinto bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) seed coat turns brown over time due to oxidation of its proanthocyanidins. Pinto beans that have slow‚Äêdarkening (SD) or non‚Äêdarkening (ND) seed coats are more desired in the market because they are perceived to be fresh, high‚Äêquality beans. However, correlations between the ND seed coat trait and agronomic performance have not been investigated. Therefore, the objectives of this study were to estimate variance components and broad‚Äêsense heritabilities of agronomic and seed coat traits in pinto beans, and to determine if correlations exist between the ND seed coat trait and agronomic, sensory, and cooking traits in recombinant inbred lines, developed from crosses between ND pinto bean breeding lines, incorporating the ND gene from ‚ÄòWit‚Äêrood boontje‚Äô, with two regular‚Äêdarkening (RD) pinto bean varieties (‚ÄòStampede‚Äô in Population¬†1 and ‚ÄòLa Paz‚Äô in Population¬†2), grown in four different environments of southwest Ontario in 2016. Analysis of variance indicated significant differences between the RD and ND genotypes for grain yield, 100‚Äêseed weight, hydration capacity, and the seed coat color parameters in both populations. The color parameter L*, which represents the whiteness of the seed coat, was selected as the main discriminative parameter between the RD and ND seed coat phenotypes. There was a weak positive genetic correlation between the ND trait and days to maturity in Population¬†1 (rg¬†=¬†.11). The ND trait showed weak negative genetic correlations with grain yield (rg¬†=¬†‚àí.23 in Population¬†1 and rg¬†=¬†‚àí.13 in Population¬†2). Moderately weak positive genetic correlations were found between the ND trait and hydration capacity in Population¬†1 (rg¬†=¬†.44) and Population¬†2 (rg¬†=¬†.40). The ND pinto beans were perceived as sweeter and had softer and smoother textures and shorter cooking times compared with the RD pinto beans.  aPublisher supplied data  cOntario Bean Growers, Agriculture and Agri‚ÄêFood Canada  cOntario Ministry of Research and Innovation 3aPhaseolus vulgaris 3aagronomic traits 3aanalysis of variance 3acolor 3agenetic correlation 3agrain yield 3amarkets 3aoxidation 3apinto beans 3aproanthocyanidins 3aseed coat 3avariance 3aOntario1 aDuizer, Lisa1 aPauls, K.

Critical factors are found by investigating Levelized Cost of Energy, and using the tools PESTEL and Porter‚Äôs five competitive forces. Identified factors are then applied on three business cases to investigate their impact on viability. The results show that one of the main challenges facing off-grid commercialization is the few wave energy converter units installed per location, negating the economy of scale that large wave energy farms count on to achieve competitive cost levels. In addition, factors like current cost of energy, available wave resources, distance from shore, infrastructure, supply chain logistics, and electricity demand are found to be deciding factors for viability. Despite these challenges, it is found that there are potentially viable off-grid business cases for commercialization of wave energy converters.  aPublisher supplied data 3acommercialization 3aeconomies of scale 3aelectricity 3aenergy conversion 3aenergy costs 3afarms 3aresorts 3asupply chain 3awater power1 aKlementsen, Eirik1 aMuller, Gerrit1 ade Andres, Adrian1 aMaillet, J√©romine0 tSustainability.g2016 Dec. 07, v. 8, no. 12dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2270x2071-10507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su81212743Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02135naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001600142245013100158300001800289520068100307592002800988650001901016650002001035650001101055650002301066650001101089650002001100650001601120650002001136650001301156650001601169700002401185700001801209700001901227700001901246700002201265700002301287700006401310700002501374700005801399773014701457856007601604852000901680655001201689IND60687135920221123024730.0200325e20200302xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068713592DNAL7 a10.1021/jacs.9b124572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLin, Yingfu12aA Selenourea-Thiourea Br√∏nsted Acid Catalyst Facilitates Asymmetric Conjugate Additions of Amines to Œ±,Œ≤-Unsaturated Esters  ap. 5627-5635.  aŒ≤-Amino esters are obtained with high levels of enantioselectivity via the conjugate addition of cyclic amines to unactivated Œ±,Œ≤-unsaturated esters. A related strategy enables the kinetic resolution of racemic cyclic 2-arylamines, using benzyl acrylate as the resolving agent. Reactions are facilitated by an unprecedented selenourea-thiourea organocatalyst. As elucidated by DFT calculations and ¬π¬≥C kinetic isotope effect studies, the rate-limiting and enantiodetermining step of the reaction is the protonation of a zwitterionic intermediate by the catalyst. This represents a rare case in which a thiourea compound functions as an asymmetric Br√∏nsted acid catalyst.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBronsted acids 3aaromatic amines 3acarbon 3aenantioselectivity 3aesters 3aorganocatalysts 3aprotonation 3astable isotopes 3athiourea 3azwitterions1 aHirschi, William J.1 aKunadia, Anuj1 aPaul, Anirudra1 aGhiviriga, Ion1 aAbboud, Khalil A.1 aKarugu, Rachael W.1 aVetticatt, Mathew J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5709-08851 aHirschi, Jennifer S.1 aSeidel, Daniel1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6725-111X0 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2020 Mar. 02, v. 142, no. 12 p.5627-5635dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19166x1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jacs.9b124573Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03882naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094024002200127024001900149040001800168100002100186245014100207300001600348506007600364520230400440592002802744506003702772650001602809650001402825650001602839650001402855650002302869650000902892650001202901650001302913650001202926650004102938650002302979650002203002650002203024650002103046700001403067700002003081700002103101700001903122700002003141773013903161856007903300852000903379655001203388IND60114824120221207090827.0141124e201409  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011482412DNAL7 a10.3945/ajcn.113.0812322doi7 aPMC41354902pmcid7 a250307822pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHeden, Timothy D10aModerate amounts of fructose- or glucose-sweetened beverages do not differentially alter metabolic health in male and female adolescents  ap. 796-805.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBackground: Adolescents consume more sugar-sweetened beverages than do individuals in any other age group, but it is unknown how the type of sugar-sweetened beverage affects metabolic health in this population.Objective: The objective was to compare the metabolic health effects of short-term (2-wk) consumption of high-fructose (HF) and high-glucose (HG)‚Äìsweetened beverages in adolescents (15‚Äì20 y of age).Design: In a counterbalanced, single-blind fashion, 40 male and female adolescents completed two 2-wk trials that included 1) an HF trial in which they consumed 710 mL of a sugar-sweetened beverage/d (equivalent to 50 g fructose/d and 15 g glucose/d) for 2 wk and 2) an HG trial in which they consumed 710 mL of a sugar-sweetened beverage/d (equivalent to 50 g glucose/d and 15 g fructose/d) for 2 wk in addition to their normal ad libitum diet. In addition, the participants maintained similar physical activity levels during each trial. The day after each trial, insulin sensitivity and resistance [assessed via Quantitative Insulin Sensitivity Check Index (QUICKI) and homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) index] and fasting and postprandial glucose, lactate, lipid, cholesterol, insulin, C-peptide, insulin secretion, and clearance responses to HF or HG mixed meals were assessed.Results: Body weight, QUICKI (whole-body insulin sensitivity), HOMA-IR (hepatic insulin resistance), and fasting lipids, cholesterol, glucose, lactate, and insulin secretion or clearance were not different between trials. Fasting HDL- and HDL3-cholesterol concentrations were ‚àº10‚Äì31% greater (P < 0.05) in female adolescents than in male adolescents. Postprandial triacylglycerol, HDL-cholesterol, HDL3-cholesterol, and glucose concentrations were not different between HF and HG trials. The lactate incremental area under the curve was ‚àº3.7-fold greater during the HF trial (P < 0.05), whereas insulin secretion was 19% greater during the HG trial (P < 0.05).Conclusions: Moderate amounts of HF- or HG-sweetened beverages for 2 wk did not have differential effects on fasting or postprandial cholesterol, triacylglycerol, glucose, or hepatic insulin clearance in weight-stable, physically active adolescents.

Programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) is a negative regulator of T cell function and is frequently expressed by solid tumors. By engaging programmed death 1 (PD-1) on activated T cells, PD-L1‚Å∫ tumors directly render tumor-specific T cells, including adoptively transferred T cells, functionally exhausted. As a strategy to overcome tumor PD-L1 effects on adoptively transferred T cells, we sought to convert PD-1 to a T cell costimulatory receptor by exchanging its transmembrane and cytoplasmic tail with that of CD28. Rather than becoming exhausted upon engagement of PD-L1‚Å∫ tumors, we hypothesized that CD8‚Å∫ cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) genetically modified to express this PD1:CD28 chimera would exhibit enhanced functional attributes. Here we show that cell surface expressed PD1:CD28 retains the capacity to bind PD-L1 resulting in T cell costimulation as evidenced by increased levels of ERK phosphorylation, augmentation of cytokine secretion, increased proliferative capacity, and enhanced expression of effector molecule Granzyme B. We provide evidence that this chimera could serve as a novel engineering strategy to overcome PD-L1 mediated immunosuppression.  aPublisher supplied data 3acytokines 3acytotoxic T-lymphocytes 3acytotoxicity 3adeath 3ahumans 3amitogen-activated protein kinase 3aneoplasms 3aphosphorylation 3asecretion1 aBrown, Christine E.1 aShami, Andrew F.1 aForman, Stephen J.1 aJensen, Michael C.0 tMolecular immunology.g2012 July, v. 51, no. 3-4 p.263-272dElsevier Ltdx0161-58907nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.molimm.2012.03.0233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03082naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002000142245011200162300001800274520156200292592002801854650002201882650001701904650002301921650001101944650002101955650002601976650002302002650002902025650001302054650001702067650001102084650002202095650001602117650001702133700006102150700002202211700005602233700005402289700006102343773014702404856007602551852000902627655001202636IND60687136120221123024742.0200325e20200220xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068713612DNAL7 a10.1021/jacs.9b126662doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZheng, Weizhong10aEnhanced Menshutkin SN2 Reactivity in Mesoporous Silica: The Influence of Surface Catalysis and Confinement  ap. 5636-5648.  aA significant enhancement in the Menshutkin SN2 reaction between 1-methylimidazole (MeIm) and methyl thiocyanate (MeSCN) is observed when the reaction is confined in the nanoscale silica pores of MCM41 and SBA15. The experiments in the silica pores are conducted without the surrounding bulk reaction mixture. The influences of temperature, pore radius, and surface chemistry on the kinetics of the confined reaction are analyzed with time-dependent infrared spectroscopy, molecular dynamics simulations, and ab initio calculations. The rate constant of the pseudo-first order reaction increases with decreasing pore size, and the activation energy is found to decrease by 5.6 kJ/mol in the smallest pore studied (2.8 nm) relative to the bulk reaction. The rate constant dependence on pore size is accurately described by a two-state model in which molecules within the 4.6 √Ö interfacial layer experience a 2.4-fold rate constant increase relative to those reacting at the bulk rate further away from the interface. The removal of polar silanol groups from the silica surface via passivation with trimethylsilyl chloride results in bulk-like kinetics despite a reduction in the pore diameter, demonstrating the role of silanols as catalytic sites. Electronic structure calculations of the energy profile on a model silica surface confirm that silanol groups, particularly those of the vicinal type, can reduce the activation energy and reaction endothermicity through the donation of hydrogen bonds to the reactant, transition state, and product complexes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactivation energy 3aactive sites 3acatalytic activity 3aenergy 3ahydrogen bonding 3ainfrared spectroscopy 3amolecular dynamics 3aorganochlorine compounds 3aporosity 3aporous media 3asilica 3asimulation models 3atemperature 3athiocyanates1 aYamada, Steven A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3171-16251 aHung, Samantha T.1 aSun, Weizhen1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9957-36201 aZhao, Ling1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5239-11521 aFayer, Michael D.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0021-18150 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2020 Feb. 20, v. 142, no. 12 p.5636-5648dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19166x1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jacs.9b126663Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03207naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245011100165500002200276520170300298592002802001650002502029650001502054650001802069650001702087650001902104650001502123650002202138650001402160650001202174650001302186650001202199650001302211650001502224653003002239653001102269653002102280653002402301653002802325700002202353700002302375700002202398700001902420700002102439773016102460856008302621852000902704655001202713IND60616295020221120202911.0190412e20180727xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061629502DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jneb.2018.07.0172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLepe, Silvia10aProcess Evaluation of a Policy, Systems, and Environmental Change Intervention in an Urban School District  aPre-press version  aTo conduct a comprehensive process evaluation of a policy, systems, and environmental (PSE) change intervention.Quasi-experimental, mixed methods.Low-income urban school district.Fifth-grade students in 4 schools assigned to 2 intervention and 2 comparison schools (intervention, n‚ÄØ=‚ÄØ142; comparison, n‚ÄØ=‚ÄØ170).Both groups received a nutrition curriculum delivered by classroom teachers. Intervention schools also received 10 PSE lessons taught by paraprofessional educators.Quantitative data were obtained from fidelity and observation checklists, grading rubrics and self-reported student surveys. Focus group and interviews provided qualitative data. Quantitative measures included assessments of PSE and fruit and vegetable knowledge, as well as assessment of times fruits and vegetables (FV) were consumed yesterday.Qualitative data were analyzed using inductive content analysis. Quantitative data were analyzed using repeated measures analysis of variance and analysis of co-variance.Fidelity, dose, reach, and acceptance of PSE intervention were high; students felt more empowered, although PSE lessons were considered lengthy and complicated. Intervention PSE and FV knowledge scores were significantly higher than comparison scores (F37.56, P < .001; and F3.94, P < .05, respectively). However, issues in communication were identified between school staff and researchers.Policy, systems, and environmental classroom interventions commented on the differences between quantitative and qualitative assessments, and this suggests the need for more sensitive quantitative assessments. Future research should look at long-term outcomes as this study only looked at short-term outcomes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanalysis of variance 3acurriculum 3adata analysis 3afocus groups 3afruit products 3ainterviews 3aissues and policy 3anutrition 3aschools 3astudents 3asurveys 3ateachers 3avegetables 0afood and nutrition policy 0apolicy 0aschool nutrition 0astudent empowerment 0asystems and environment1 aGoodwin, Jennifer1 aMulligan, Katie T.1 aBalestracci, Kate1 aSebelia, Linda1 aGreene, Geoffrey0 tJournal of nutrition education and behavior.g2018 July 27, dElsevier Inc.aSociety for Nutrition Education and BehaviorwJournal:jnl70490x1499-40467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jneb.2018.07.0173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02828naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094024002200138024001900160040001800179100001800197245013800215300002000353506007600373520125600449592002801705506003701733650001801770650001501788650002401803650001701827650001201844650001601856650001401872650001201886650001601898650001701914650001801931650002501949650002601974650001702000650001702017700002202034700002302056700001702079700001802096700002002114773008902134856009002223852000902313655001202322IND60090564420221207124635.0141102e201312  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009056442DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biomaterials.2013.09.0192doi7 aPMC39008652pmcid7 a240754072pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHajdu, P√©ter10aFunctionalized liposomes loaded with siRNAs targeting ion channels in effector memory T cells as a potential therapy for autoimmunity  ap. 10249-10257.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aEffector memory T cells (TM) play a key role in the pathology of certain autoimmune disorders. The activity of effector TM cells is under the control of Kv1.3 ion channels, which facilitate the Ca¬≤‚Å∫ influx necessary for T cell activation and function, i.e. cytokine release and proliferation. Consequently, the knock-down of Kv1.3 expression in effector TM's may be utilized as a therapy for the treatment of autoimmune diseases. In this study we synthesized lipid unilamellar nanoparticles (NPs) that can selectively deliver Kv1.3 siRNAs into TM cells in¬†vitro. NPs made from a mixture of phosphatidylcholine, pegylated/biotinylated phosphoethanolamine and cholesterol were functionalized with biotinylated-CD45RO (cell surface marker of TM's) antibodies via fluorophore-conjugated streptavidin (CD45RO-NPs). Incubation of T cells with CD45RO-NPs resulted into the selective attachment and endocytosis of the NPs into TM's. Furthermore, the siRNA against Kv1.3, encapsulated into the CD45RO-NPs, was released into the cytosol. Consequently, the expression of Kv1.3 channels decreased significantly in TM's, which led to a remarkable decrease in Ca¬≤‚Å∫ influx. Our results can form the basis of an innovative therapeutic approach in autoimmunity.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aT-lymphocytes 3aantibodies 3aautoimmune diseases 3aautoimmunity 3acalcium 3acholesterol 3acytokines 3acytosol 3aendocytosis 3aion channels 3ananoparticles 3aphosphatidylcholines 3asmall interfering RNA 3astreptavidin 3atherapeutics1 aChimote, Ameet A.1 aThompson, Tyler H.1 aKoo, Youngmi1 aYun, Yeoheung1 aConforti, Laura0 tBiomaterials.g2013 Dec., v. 34, no. 38 p.10249-10257dElsevier Ltdx0142-96127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biomaterials.2013.09.0193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02660naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002800147245008100175300001600256520132600272592002801598650001701626650002901643650002301672650001601695650001701711650001101728650003401739650000901773650001401782650001501796650001401811650001801825650000901843650001001852650001501862650004301877651001101920700002401931700001901955700002201974773011501996856008202111852000902193655001202202IND60593459620221122184058.0180619e201805  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059345962DNAL7 a10.1007/s11625-017-0494-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 ada Rocha, DiogoFerreira14aThe map of conflicts related to environmental injustice and health in Brazil  ap. 709-719.  aThis article discusses the experience of the map of conflicts related to environmental injustices and health in Brazil and its potential contribution to international movements for environmental justice. Inventories and maps of environmental injustices are important instruments of struggle against injustice and racism, since they increase the visibility of populations, whose lives are threatened. The Brazilian map is published online since 2010 and was an initiative of FIOCRUZ, a public health and academic institution, and the NGO FASE, in cooperation with the Brazilian Network of Environmental Injustice (RBJA), created in 2001. Environmental justice arised in Brazil as a field of reflection and mobilization, and as a rallying point to identify the struggle of several groups and entities, such as rural and urban grassroots movements, indigenous peoples, traditional populations, and peasants affected by different hazards and risks, as well as environmentalists, trade unions, and scientists. Currently, the map has 570 emblematic environmental conflicts in all regions of Brazil. Many economic activities are causing the conflicts such as mining expansion, oil and gas extractions, infrastructure (roads, mega-dams), agribusiness, and pesticide pollution, often with the support of governmental institutions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagribusiness 3aeducational institutions 3aindigenous peoples 3ainventories 3alabor unions 3amining 3anongovernmental organizations 3aoils 3apeasantry 3apesticides 3apollution 3apublic health 3arisk 3aroads 3ascientists 3asustainability science and engineering 3aBrazil1 aPorto, MarceloFirpo1 aPacheco, Tania1 aLeroy, JeanPierre0 tSustainability science.g2018 May, v. 13, no. 3 p.709-719dSpringer JapanwJournal:J000001136x1862-40657nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11625-017-0494-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03778naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003800113040001800151100002100169245013100190300001800321520170700339592002802046650001602074650002302090650001702113650001702130650001302147650000902160650001802169650002602187650001302213650003302226650001602259650001102275650001402286650004802300650001202348650003902360650001502399650001802414650003802432650004102470650001302511650003602524650003102560650000902591650003502600650002102635650008902656650004502745650001302790650004502803650001602848650001702864700001802881700002102899773009202920856008403012990002303096852000903119655001203128IND60087411320221118014718.0141102e201210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008741132DNAL7 a227056352pmid7 a10.1016/j.actbio.2012.06.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBearat, Hanin H.10aComparison of properties between NIPAAm-based simultaneously physically and chemically gelling polymer systems for use in vivo  ap. 3629-3642.  aIn this work, a comparison between two different physical‚Äìchemical gels, poly(NIPAAm-co-cysteamine) with poly(NIPAAm-co-cysteamine-vinylsulfone) and poly(NIPAAm-co-cysteamine) with poly(NIPAAm-co-HEMA-acrylate), is made. These hydrogels undergo gelation via dual mechanisms: temperature sensitivity (physical gelation) and chemical crosslinking (chemical gelation). The advantages of using both gelation mechanisms are to reduce the creep experienced by purely physical gels and to increase the elastic modulus of purely chemical gels. Here, the physical‚Äìchemical gels were synthesized and characterized for their chemical, structural, thermal, mechanical and morphological properties. The gels were also tested for their gelation kinetics, swelling, degradation and cytotoxicity. The copolymers were successfully synthesized and their phase transition temperatures fall in a feasible range (29‚Äì34¬∞C) for use in vivo. With rheology, it was shown that use of simultaneous physical and chemical gelation resulted in improved properties, with increased elastic moduli and reduced frequency dependence. The rates of reaction of thiols to vinyls differ between the two systems, demonstrating a greater effect of chemical gelation in one gelling system over the other, due to the faster rate of thiols consumed into reaction. The morphology of the gels proved to be quite different when analyzed by scanning electron microscopy, showing differences in swelling behaviors. Cell studies illustrated good growth of cells exposed to the gels. Both hydrogels, although possessing slight differences, demonstrate the capability of being injected in vivo for use as embolic agents for occlusion of aneurysms.  aPublisher supplied data 3acell growth 3acomposite polymers 3acrosslinking 3acytotoxicity 3agelation 3agels 3ahydrocolloids 3amodulus of elasticity 3arheology 3ascanning electron microscopy 3atemperature 3athiols 2a3T3 Cells 2aAcrylamidesxchemical synthesisxchemistry. 2aAnimals 2aCalorimetry, Differential Scanning 2aCell Death 2aCell Survival 2aCross-Linking Reagentsxchemistry 2aGelsxchemical synthesisxchemistry. 2aKinetics 2aMagnetic Resonance Spectroscopy 2aMaterials Testingxmethods 2aMice 2aMicroscopy, Electron, Scanning 2aMolecular Weight 2aPolyhydroxyethyl Methacrylatexanalogs & derivativesxchemical synthesisxchemistry. 2aPolymersxchemical synthesisxchemistry. 2aRheology 2aSpectroscopy, Fourier Transform Infrared 2aTemperature 2aTime Factors1 aLee, Bae Hoon1 aVernon, Brent L.0 tActa biomaterialia.g2012 Oct., v. 8, no. 10 p.3629-3642dElsevier Ltdx1742-70617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.actbio.2012.06.0123Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01714naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001300151245011900164300001400283520061300297592002800910650003200938650001700970650001900987650001001006650002501016650001501041653003801056653002201094653002001116653002601136700001601162773009201178856008501270852000901355655001201364IND60529723520221117191047.0161020e20160320xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052972352DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jbiotec.2016.02.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Lei10aComplete genome sequence of Lactobacillus paraplantarum L-ZS9, a probiotic starter producing class II bacteriocins  ap. 15-16.  aLactobacillus paraplantarum L-ZS9 is a probiotic starter isolated from fermented sausage and it is a great producer of class II bacteriocins.

The results of NMR chemical shift measurements and MD simulations showed that the diglyme oxygen atoms have contact with the imidazolium hydrogen atoms of [C‚ÇÑmim]‚Å∫ in the mixtures. The contact between the hydrogen atoms of imidazolium and the oxygen atoms of [TFSA]‚Åª remains even when the diglyme mole fraction (xd·µ¢g‚Çóy‚Çò‚Çë) increases up to 0.9. However, the coordination numbers of the hydrogen atoms of [C‚ÇÑmim]‚Å∫ with oxygen atoms of diglyme increase with xd·µ¢g‚Çóy‚Çò‚Çë. The [TFSA]‚Åª anions around [C‚ÇÑmim]‚Å∫ are not completely replaced by diglyme even at xd·µ¢g‚Çóy‚Çò‚Çë > 0.9. The MD simulations revealed that the diglymes also have contact with the butyl group of [C‚ÇÑmim]‚Å∫. The methyl groups of diglyme prefer to have contact with the terminal methyl group of the butyl group, whereas the diglyme oxygen atoms prefer to have contact with the methylene group connected to the imidazolium ring of [C‚ÇÑmim]‚Å∫.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanions 3acations 3ahydrogen 3aionic liquids 3amolecular dynamics 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aoxygen1 aKodama, Daisuke1 aKanakubo, Mitsuhiro1 aTsuzuki, Seiji0 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2017 Apr. 06, v. 121, no. 13 p.2873-2881dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-52077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.jpcb.6b117433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01961naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245012300166300001600289520066700305592002800972650001701000650001501017650002301032650001501055650001301070650004301083650001701126651001001143700002001153700002101173700001901194700002101213700002001234700002201254700002101276700001801297700001801315773011501333856008201448852000901530655001201539IND60593459720221122184100.0180619e201805  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059345972DNAL7 a10.1007/s11625-017-0503-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTamura, Makoto10aDeveloping joint educational programs in sustainability science across different universities: a case study from Japan  ap. 849-860.  aThe challenge for sustainability educational programs lies in how to imbue students with the strong motivation necessary to move the world in a more sustainable direction.

The objectives of this study were to evaluate the effect of chitooligosaccharide (COS) on expression of a specific panel of cytokine genes involved in inflammation and to delineate the signal transduction pathway underlying the COS mediated inflammatory response. Human intestinal epithelial-like (Caco-2) cells were treated with COS (5000‚Äì10,000Da) and expression of a panel of eighty-four cytokine genes was analyzed by quantitative real-time PCR. COS induced up-regulation of a total of 11 genes including CCL20 and IL8 and concurrent down-regulation of 10 genes including pro-inflammatory mediators CCL15, CCL25 and IL1B. To further establish the signal transduction pathway of COS mediated response in Caco-2 cells, two major inflammatory signal transduction pathways (NF-Œ∫B and AP-1) were investigated. COS had inhibitory effect (P<0.01) on TNF-Œ± induced NF-Œ∫B binding activity while stimulatory effect (P<0.001) on AP-1 binding activity. COS also inhibited the expression of RELA (P<0.01) and IKBKB (P<0.01) genes of NF-Œ∫B pathway while stimulate the expression of JUN (P<0.05) gene of AP-1 pathway. In conclusion, COS elicits an acute inflammatory cytokine response in Caco-2 cells and hence it has the potential to stimulate the immune system in the gut epithelium.  aPublisher supplied data 3abioactive properties 3achemokine CCL15 3achemokine CCL20 3achemokine CCL25 3achitooligosaccharides 3adigestive system 3aepithelium 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3ahuman cell lines 3ahumans 3aimmune system 3ainflammation 3ainterleukin-8 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3asignal transduction 3atranscription factor NF-kappa B1 aO‚ÄôDoherty, John V.1 aMaher, Sam1 aMcMorrow, Jason1 aSweeney, Torres0 tMolecular immunology.g2012 July, v. 51, no. 3-4 p.283-291dElsevier Ltdx0161-58907nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.molimm.2012.03.0273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02847naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245007100163300001600234520162500250592002801875650001801903650002301921650001301944650002001957650002001977650001601997650001002013650002002023650002002043650002502063650001102088650001302099650001202112650002202124700001802146700001702164700001202181700001902193700001902212773011302231856004802344852000902392655001202401IND50066601020221121042154.0130523e201306  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006660102DNAL7 a10.1007/s11240-013-0294-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHan, Xuezhi10aSsp DnaE split-intein mediated split-Cre reconstitution in tobacco  ap. 529-542.  aThe Cre/loxP system is increasingly exploited for spatial and temporal gene activation or inactivation. In this study, a novel approach for gene activation using a Cre/loxp system in tobacco is described. As the DnaE intein in Synechocystis sp. strain PCC6803 is capable of catalyzing a protein trans-splicing reaction to assemble a mature protein from two separate precursors, the N- and C-terminal ends of the Cre enzyme, split between Gly190 and Gly191, were fused to N- and C-terminals of the Ssp DnaE split intein,respectively. Subsequently, in-frame fusions of NCre/NInt and CInt/CCre are assembled into the pCAMBIA1300 cloning vector, and used for co-expression, along with the BAR selectable marker gene for BASTA herbicide resistance in tobacco. A Cre-dependent excision recombination event is monitored when tobacco leaf explants are screened for resistance to Basta, but along with absence of beta-glucuronidase activity. Based on herbicide resistance, an efficient recombination event is observed, in vivo Bar activation following co-expression of NCre/NInt and CInt/CCre fusion genes in pCAGUS/BAR transgenic lines. Moreover, the recombination efficiency is comparable to that of intact Cre gene expression. However, no Cre recombination event is observed when only the NCre and CCre genes or the NCre/NInt fusion gene and the CCre genes are co-expressed. Thus, the Ssp DnaE split intein-mediated Cre activity reconstitution observed in this study provides an alternative approach for the traditional Cre/loxP system, and this may aid in achieving dynamic regulation of gene expression in transgenic plants.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSynechocystis 3abeta-glucuronidase 3aexcision 3agene activation 3agene expression 3agene fusion 3agenes 3agenetic markers 3agenetic vectors 3aherbicide resistance 3aleaves 3aproteins 3atobacco 3atransgenic plants1 aHan, Fengying1 aRen, Xuesong1 aSi, Jun1 aLi, Chengqiong1 aSong, Hongyuan0 tPlant cell, tissue, and organ culture.g2013 June, v. 113, no. 3 p.529-542dSpringer-Verlagx0167-68577nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11240-013-0294-2  aDNAL 7aarticle02726naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245007400168300001600242520136300258592002801621650001301649650001401662650002501676650001501701650003801716650002001754650003101774650001001805650002001815650002601835650001901861650002001880650001901900650002201919650002401941650001401965650001301979700002301992700001302015700002102028700002002049773009402069856008402163852000902247655001202256IND60113839420221121124946.0141112e201207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011383942DNAL7 a10.1016/j.molimm.2012.03.0262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAwate, Sunita10aActivation of adjuvant core response genes by the novel adjuvant PCEP  ap. 292-303.  aAdjuvants are critical components of many vaccines but their mechanisms of action are often poorly understood. Understanding the mechanisms of adjuvant activity is critical in defining how innate immunity influenced adaptive immunity. We investigated the capacity of a novel adjuvant, poly[di(sodiumcarboxylatoethylphenoxy)phosphazene] (PCEP), to induce innate immune responses at the site of injection. PCEP induced time-dependent changes in the gene expression of many ‚Äúadjuvant core response genes‚Äù including cytokines, chemokines, innate immune receptors, interferon-induced genes, adhesion molecules and antigen-presentation genes. In addition, PCEP triggered local production of cytokines and the chemokine CCL-2 as indicated by ELISA. Interestingly, PCEP up-regulated the gene expression of the inflammasome receptor, Nlrp3, and induced the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1Œ≤, and IL-18 at the site of injection. Secretion of these cytokines is predominantly a result of activation of the inflammasome, a multi-protein complex that activates caspase-1, leading to the processing and secretion of proinflammatory cytokines. These results suggest that PCEP may modulate antigen-specific immune responses by strongly activating early innate immune responses and promoting a strong immuno-stimulatory environment at the site of injection.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadhesion 3aadjuvants 3aantigen presentation 3achemokines 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3agene expression 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3aimmune response 3aimmunologic receptors 3ainjection site 3ainnate immunity 3ainterleukin-18 3ainterleukin-1beta 3amechanism of action 3asecretion 3avaccines1 aWilson, Heather L.1 aLai, Ken1 aBabiuk, Lorne A.1 aMutwiri, George0 tMolecular immunology.g2012 July, v. 51, no. 3-4 p.292-303dElsevier Ltdx0161-58907nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.molimm.2012.03.0263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01654naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100003900151245014000190300001600330520044900346592002800795650001400823650001200837650001800849650001200867650001300879650001500892651001100907653001800918653001300936653001600949653001500965653001000980700004400990700002801034773011201062856008501174852000901259655001201268IND60573665320221118113252.0170724e20170704xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057366532DNAL7 a10.1080/01647954.2017.13170222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVasconcelos, Ana Caroline Oliveira10aUncommon record of a whip spider (Amblypygi: Charinidae) parasitized by a chigger mite (Parasitengona: Trombiculidae: Leeuwenhoekiinae)  ap. 343-346.  aThis work reports a mite larva of the genus Leeuwenhoekia Oudemans parasitizing an individual of Charinus iuiu Vasconcelos & Ferreira found in a cave of the state of Bahia, Brazil.

In this study, we present a new method for reducing uncertainty in forest aboveground biomass (AGB) estimation based on plot-level terrestrial laser scanner (TLS) point clouds reconstruction. The method estimates the total AGB of plots with complex structures after automatically performing the steps of ground point filtering, single tree segmentation, and three-dimensional (3D) structure reconstruction. We used plot data from temperate and tropical forest ecosystems to verify the effectiveness of the method, reconstructing a 1300¬†m¬≤ temperate plantation plot and a 5000¬†m¬≤ mingled forest plot, respectively. The total biomass of 153 trees in the plantation plot was overestimated by 17.12¬†%, and the total biomass of 61 trees in the mingled forest plot was underestimated by 10.88¬†%. We found that the uncertainty of aboveground biomass estimation in tropical forests with more complex structures is not necessarily greater than in plantations. Therefore, in large-scale remote sensing observations of forest biomass, the number or area of plots can be increased to reduce the uncertainty of the results caused by the complex structure. The focus of this study is to explore TLS point clouds modeling methods to reduce the uncertainty in AGB estimation caused by the complexity of forest structures, and to provide reference cases for plot-level point clouds reconstruction methods. Forest ecologists can use this method to regularly observe forest growth and obtain indicators related to forest ecology without destroying trees.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aaboveground biomass 3aforest growth 3ameta-analysis 3ascanners 3atrees 3atropical forests 3auncertainty 0aComplex forest structure 0aAbove-ground biomass 0aEstimation uncertainty 0aPlot-level 0aTLS point clouds1 aXu, Zhenyu1 aWang, Jinhu1 aNan, Liangliang1 aXiao, Huijie1 aXin, Zhiming1 aChen, Feixiang0 tEcological indicators.g2022 Sept., v. 142 p.109211-dElsevier LtdwJournal:6196x1470-160X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2022.1092113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02347naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100006300146245011200209300002000321520103700341592002801378650001201406650001201418650001901430650001601449650001401465650001701479650001301496650001101509650001901520650002901539651001301568700007101581700005801652773017301710856008101883852000901964655001201973IND60619434620190226000000.0190226e20181008xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061943462DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.iecr.8b024472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNayak-Luke, Richard1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6872-582010a‚ÄúGreen‚Äù Ammonia: Impact of Renewable Energy Intermittency on Plant Sizing and Levelized Cost of Ammonia  ap. 14607-14616.  aAmmonia production currently contributes almost 11% of global industrial carbon dioxide emissions, or 1.3% of global emissions. In the context of global emission targets and growing demand, decarbonization of this process is highly desirable. We present a method to calculate a first estimate for the optimum size of an ammonia production plant (at the process level), the required renewable energy (RE) supply, and the levelized cost of ammonia (LCOA) for islanded operation with a hydrogen buffer. A model was developed to quantitatively identify the key variables that impact the LCOA (relative to a ¬±10 GBP/tonne change in LCOA): levelized cost of electricity (¬±0.89 GBP/MWh), electrolyzer capital expenditure (¬±65 GBP/kW), minimum Haber‚ÄìBosch (HB) load (¬±12% of rated power), maximum rate of HB load ramping, and RE supply mix. Using 2025/2030 estimates results in a LCOA of 588 GBP/tonne for Lerwick, Scotland. The application of the model will facilitate and improve the production of carbon-free ammonia in the future.  aPublisher supplied data 3aammonia 3acapital 3acarbon dioxide 3aelectricity 3aemissions 3aenergy costs 3ahydrogen 3amodels 3aprocess design 3arenewable energy sources 3aScotland1 aBa√±ares Alc√°ntara, Ren√©,1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7859-61021 aWilkinson, Ianc(Managing Director of Cotswold Seeds)0 tIndustrial & engineering chemistry process design and development.g2018 Oct. 08, v. 57, no. 43 p.14607-14616dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23342x1520-50457nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.iecr.8b024473Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03410naa a2200649 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245006600169300001600235520152100251592002801772650005801800650002401858650001401882650001101896650001701907650001801924650001401942650002101956650001401977650002101991650001202012650001502024650002202039650002002061650001102081651001302092653001802105653002402123653002002147653001302167653002502180653002202205700001902227700001902246700001802265700002102283700002202304700002102326700001902347700002202366700002302388700002502411700002502436700002102461700002502482700001902507773011602526856008502642961001202727852000902739655001202748IND60526244120221119202335.0190403e20160815xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052624412DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foreco.2016.05.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPhillips, Juan10aLive aboveground carbon stocks in natural forests of Colombia  ap. 119-128.  aEmission factors are essential in order to accurately account and report land use and land use change emissions due to deforestation at a national level, in accordance with the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change reporting guidelines. Nonetheless, in many tropical countries its availability is still scarce, especially in Colombia where a National Forest Inventory is lacking. Here, we estimate the amount of carbon stored in the live aboveground biomass of the forests of Colombia, using data from 4981 sampling forest plots of various sizes established between 1990 and 2014. Our study included an analysis of the influence of the choice of allometric model and the carbon density estimation method employed in the estimation. We found that the most conservative total mean value for the entire country was 226.9¬±4.5Mgha‚àí1, obtained by using a previous set of allometric equations developed for the natural forest of Colombia and an inverse-variance weighting that accounts for the variation in plot size, which represents a potential stock of 6.44¬±0.13Pg of carbon. Thus, our study provides a method to utilize existing sample data to assess forest carbon stocks at national level, make available conservative carbon stocks estimates for the natural forests of Colombia, and reports enhanced and adequate information subject to national capabilities and policies in the context of results-based payments for reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation and the conservation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aUnited Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change 3aaboveground biomass 3aallometry 3acarbon 3acarbon sinks 3adeforestation 3aemissions 3aemissions factor 3aequations 3aforest inventory 3aforests 3aguidelines 3aissues and policy 3aland use change 3amodels 3aColombia 0aCarbon stocks 0aAboveground biomass 0aNatural forests 0aColombia 0aAllometric equations 0aEstimation method1 aDuque, √Ålvaro1 aScott, Charles1 aWayson, Craig1 aGalindo, Gustavo1 aCabrera, Edersson1 aChave, J√©r√¥me,1 aPe√±a, Miguel,1 a√Ålvarez, Esteban1 aC√°rdenas, Dairon,1 aDuivenvoorden, Joost1 aHildebrand, Patricio1 aStevenson, Pablo1 aRam√≠rez, Sebasti√°n1 aYepes, Adriana0 tForest ecology and management.g2016 Aug. 15, v. 374 p.119-128dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl9013x0378-11277nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2016.05.0093Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/FS  aDNAL 7aarticle03644naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002000145245009900165506002800264520213000292592002802422506003702450650002902487650001302516650001702529650001502546650001302561650001402574650000702588650002602595650001602621650001602637650001602653650001602669650001702685650001502702650001102717651001202728653001702740653002502757653001002782653003302792653002502825700001802850700001902868700001602887773013402903856008003037852000903117655001203126IND60774205820221207110509.0200213e201912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077420582DNAL7 a10.15673/fst.v13i4.15552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKananykhina, O.10aFeatures of the process of fermentation of the winematerials in the conditions of odesa region  aResource is Open Access  aOne of the most important problems of the modern wine production technology is the production of high quality and competitive products. As you know, wine quality largely depends on the breed of yeast. The main requirement for yeast is completeness of fermentation, which depends on the amount of yeast involved, aeration, initial content of various substances in must, temperature, pH of the environment. Application of imported materials in special conditions of national winemaking requires laboratory and industrial research to rationalize the use of local and foreign pure yeast cultures and to accelerate the process of grape must fermentation. Therefore, in the current study, influence of the yeast origin and feasibility of using additional nutrition for the process of grape must fermentation and physicochemical parameters, as well as organoleptic characteristics of white wine grape varieties Aromatniy and Zagrei of the generative breeding of National Scientific Centre ‚ÄúTairov Institute of Viticulture and Winemaking‚Äù. As a result, it was found out that the fermentation process was complete in both the control and experimental samples. There were no facts of underfermentation. When supplemental nitrogen nutrition was used, the fermentation activity of yeast increased and the fermentation process ended faster. Dynamics of the cells total number of Aromatic and Zagrei varieties was identical during 2015-2017 and did not depend on the fermentation scheme. It was discovered that the fermentation process does not depend on the added feeding, but the breed of yeast affects the physicochemical parameters, namely the content of volatile acids. The results obtained showed influence of the breed of yeast and feeding on the organoleptic characteristics of these varieties. In Southern Ukraine, in terms of influence on the quality characteristics of wine materials, application of active dry yeast of Saccharomyces cerevisiae type with a two-stage nutrition complex has a positive effect on the physicochemical parameters and allows showing the varietal characteristics of the corresponding grape variety.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3aaeration 3afermentation 3agrape must 3anitrogen 3anutrition 3apH 3aproduction technology 3atemperature 3aviticulture 3awhite wines 3awine grapes 3awine quality 3awinemaking 3ayeasts 3aUkraine 0afermentation 0awhite wine materials 0ayeast 0aorganoleptic characteristics 0avarietal descriptors1 aTkachenko, O.1 aSuhachenko, T.1 aTitlova, O.0 tHarƒçova nauka √¨ tehnolog√¨√¢.g2019 Dec., v. 13, no. 4dOdesa National University of TechnologywJournal:27799x2409-70047nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.15673/fst.v13i4.15553Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02721naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002000143245012900163500001400292520135900306592002801665650004701693650001701740650001001757650001901767650001601786650002101802650001101823650001801834650002001852650003001872650001401902650001201916650000901928650002101937650001201958650001301970650001601983700001901999700002402018700001602042773011902058856007702177852000902254655001202263IND60729254120221120203531.0210228e20210221xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072925412DNAL7 a10.3390/foods100204732doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHobbs, Madalyn 10aCurrent Perspective of Sialylated Milk Oligosaccharides in Mammalian Milk: Implications for Brain and Gut Health of Newborns  aNAL-light  aHuman milk oligosaccharides (HMOs) are the third most abundant solid component after lactose and lipids of breast milk. All mammal milk contains soluble oligosaccharides, including neutral milk oligosaccharides (NMOs) without sialic acid (Sia) moieties and acidic oligosaccharides or sialylated milk oligosaccharides (SMOs) with Sia residues at the end of sugar chains. The structural, biological diversity, and concentration of milk oligosaccharides in mammalian milk are significantly different among species. HMOs have multiple health benefits for newborns, including development of immune system, modification of the intestinal microbiota, anti-adhesive effect against pathogens, and brain development. Most infant formulas lack oligosaccharides which resemble HMOs. Formula-fed infants perform poorly across physical and psychological wellbeing measures and suffer health disadvantages compared to breast-fed infants due to the differences in the nutritional composition of breast milk and infant formula. Of these milk oligosaccharides, SMOs are coming to the forefront of research due to the beneficial nature of Sia. This review aims to critically discuss the current state of knowledge of the biology and role of SMOs in human milk, infant formula milks, and milk from several other species on gut and brain health of human and animal offspring.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSoil Moisture and Ocean Salinity satellite 3abiodiversity 3abrain 3abreast feeding 3abreast milk 3adigestive system 3ahumans 3aimmune system 3ainfant formulas 3aintestinal microorganisms 3aknowledge 3alactose 3amilk 3anutrient content 3aprogeny 3aresearch 3asialic acid1 aJahan, Marefa 1 aGhorashi, Seyed  A.1 aWang, Bing 0 tFoods.g2021 Feb. 21, v. 10, no. 2dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21651x2304-81587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/foods100204733Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03432naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002100139245009500160300001600255500001500271520222000286592002802506650001502534650001002549650001802559650001502577650002002592650001402612650001002626650002202636650001602658650002102674650002102695650001202716651001102728653001502739700002402754700002002778700001702798773010102815856007302916852000902989655001202998IND60135824020221116160522.0150522e201503  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013582402DNAL7 a10.1111/jvs.122342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHobi, Martina L.10aPattern and process in the largest primeval beech forest of Europe (Ukrainian Carpathians)  ap. 323-336.  a2019-12-04  aQUESTIONS: Are the structural characteristics of natural beech forests predominant on small monitoring plots representative of the large‚Äêscale features of these forests? Do the findings of our large‚Äêscale investigation support the hypothesis that this primeval beech forest is shaped by fine‚Äêscale processes, or is there evidence that high‚Äêseverity disturbance events have affected its structure? LOCATION: Ukrainian Carpathians, Uholka‚ÄêShyrokyi Luh, the largest primeval beech forest in Europe, covering 102.8¬†km¬≤.METHODS: On 314 (500¬†m¬≤) circular plots, systematically distributed across the forest, all living and dead trees with a DBH ‚â•6¬†cm were assessed. Lying deadwood, tree regeneration, the size of canopy gaps and the number of canopy layers were recorded. Spatial analyses were conducted using Moran's I. Dendrochronological analysis was used to reconstruct tree ages and growth patterns. RESULTS: The forest is characterized overall by a density of 435.0¬†¬±¬†12.2¬†ha‚Åª¬π(mean ¬± SE) living trees, a basal area of 36.6¬†¬±¬†0.8¬†m¬≤¬∑ha‚Åª¬π, a volume of living trees of 582.1¬†¬±¬†13.5¬†m¬≥¬∑ha‚Åª¬πand a total deadwood volume of 162.5¬†¬± 8.4¬†m¬≥¬∑ha‚Åª¬π. Beech is the dominant species (97.3¬†¬±¬†0.7%, by basal area), interspersed with mostly deciduous species with moderate shade tolerance. The forest canopy is multi‚Äêlayered, with a high abundance of old trees, and with canopy gaps rarely larger than the crown projection area of a few trees. CONCLUSIONS: The results lend support to findings from small monitoring plots, but our landscape approach allows a reliable estimation of key forest characteristics such as basal area and standing volume, which tend to be overestimated in studies on subjectively placed small monitoring plots. We conclude that disturbance events of moderate or higher severity have left only few discernible traces in forest structure or species composition. All findings suggest that this forest is characterized by a mainly small‚Äêscale disturbance regime, leading to a homogeneity of forest characteristics of the living stand at larger spatial scales and causing only minor fluctuations around the average values of forest parameters observed.  aPublisher supplied data 3amonitoring 3aFagus 3aforest canopy 3alandscapes 3ashade tolerance 3adead wood 3atrees 3aspecies diversity 3acanopy gaps 3adendrochronology 3astand basal area 3aforests 3aEurope 0abasal area1 aCommarmot, Brigitte1 aBugmann, Harald1 aWoods, Kerry0 tJournal of vegetation science.g2015 Mar., v. 26, no. 2 p.323-336dOpulus Pressx1100-92337nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jvs.122343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02445naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001500152245014700167520109300314592002801407650000801435650002501443650001001468650001901478650001501497650001201512650001901524650002401543650001601567653002801583653004201611653003701653653003201690653003001722653002801752700001301780700001601793700001801809773010001827856008701927852000902014655001202023IND60785997820221117012514.0220830e20221215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078599782DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2022.1338062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Mengge10aEffect of ultrasound pretreatment on the drying kinetics and characteristics of pregelatinized kidney beans based on microwave-assisted drying  aThis study aimed to investigate the effects of ultrasound pretreatment combined with pulse-spouted microwave vacuum drying (PSMVD) and microwave hot air rolling drying (MHARD) on the drying characteristics, microstructure and physicochemical properties of pregelatinized kidney beans.

Nutrient from droppings of these waterbirds may serve as an important source of nutrients to those systems. Previous works suggest that excess nutrients from waterbirds may lead to eutrophication. The excess nutrients also may induce nuisance growth of aquatic weeds in shallow lakes. However, the aquatic weeds serve as an important food for some avian species. The main objective of this work is to study how the waterbirds affect the dynamics of the aquatic ecosystem through a process-based modelling approach.To understand this, a lake with negligible anthropogenic nutrient influx and the high winter-avian congregation is taken as study site. A process-based dynamic ecological model with six state variables has been developed. Phosphorus (P) is taken as model currency since it is the limiting nutrient in most shallow and present in high concentration in the dropping of waterbirds. Before the model calibration, sensitivity analysis is performed with the data collected during the first year of study. Model is validated with the data collected during the second year of study.As per the model, P from the waterbird guano comprises 98.32% of P input to the lake. Parameters affecting the water-sediment exchange of P are most sensitive. P content in zooplankton is the most sensitive state variable. Nutrient budget analysis reveals that internal cycling of the nutrient is the main pathway to sustain productivity in the system. So far, no process-based modelling has been done on the impact of dropping of waterbird on nutrient dynamics of the aquatic system. This kind of model will be helpful to handle problems like eutrophication and macrophyte overgrowth due to eutrophication.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal manures 3aavifauna 3aecological models 3aeutrophication 3afreshwater 3alakes 3amacrophytes 3aphosphorus 3awater birds 3azooplankton 0aGuanotrophication 0aProcess-based modelling 0aSensitivity analysis 0aMacrophyte 0aAutomatic parameter calibration 0aWaterbirds1 aDas, Suvendu1 aRay, Santanu0 tEcological modelling.g2021 Apr. 01, v. 445 p.109495-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl6191x0304-38007nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2021.1094953Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01690naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100002900154245010800183300001600291520075600307592002801063650001501091650001501106650001401121700001801135700002201153773010501175856008801280990002301368852000901391655001201400IND60096130420221119202032.0141104e201102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009613042DNAL7 a10.1016/j.compbiomed.2010.12.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAnas, Emran Mohammad Abu10aExploiting correlation of ECG with certain EMD functions for discrimination of ventricular fibrillation  ap. 110-114.  aVentricular fibrillation (VF) is a life-threatening cardiac arrhythmia. A high impulse current is required in this stage to save lives. In this paper, an empirical mode decomposition (EMD) based algorithm is presented to separate VF from other arrhythmias. The characteristics of the VF signal has high degree of similarity with the intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) of the EMD decomposition in comparison to other ECG pathologies. This high correlation between the VF signal and its certain IMFs is exploited to separate VF from other cardiac pathologies.

To date, modelling conversion or integration of crop- and pasture-based systems in savanna ecosystems is not possible at the necessary level of detail. The Land Use Change Impact Assessment tool (LUCIA) dynamically simulates spatially explicit impacts of land-use change on ecosystem functions within a grid-based landscape. We added a physiologically detailed source-sink plant growth module with growth reserves, dynamic biomass partitioning, and dormancy to LUCIA to simulate a grazed rangeland vegetation in Borana, Ethiopia. Grass and tree growth, validated against measured above-ground biomass time series were most sensitive to dormancy break or induction parameters that control the growing period under strong rainfall seasonality. A moderate stocking rate of cattle allowed pasture persistence and continuous fodder production. Overgrazing caused depletion of root and tree stem growth reserves that were needed for seasonal regrowth. Consequently, pasture degraded due to reduced regrowth capacity and reserve replenishment. Physiological processes are well represented, laying the foundation for integration of further ecological processes, such as tree recruitment, bush encroachment, and plant community shifts.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaboveground biomass 3acattle 3adormancy 3aecosystems 3aforage 3agrasses 3aland use change 3alandscapes 3amodels 3apastures 3arain 3arangelands 3aregrowth 3asavannas 3astem elongation 3atime series analysis 3atree growth 3atrees 3aEthiopia 0aGrassland intensification 0aGrazing 0aPasture degradation 0aProcess-based model1 aMarohn, Carsten1 aAsch, Folkard0 tEcological modelling.g2021 Apr. 15, v. 446 p.109496-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl6191x0304-38007nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2021.1094963Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02862naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001500152245012400167300001400291520142100305592002801726650001501754650002401769650001401793650001101807650001501818650001601833650001301849650002401862650001601886650002901902650002001931650001501951650001801966650001901984653002702003653003002030653001702060653003602077653003702113700001902150700001702169773011002186856008702296852000902383655001202392IND60096630120221121190737.0221004e201301  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009663012DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enconman.2012.08.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSafari, S.10aParticle swarm optimization based fuzzy logic controller for autonomous green power energy system with hydrogen storage  ap. 41-49.  aThe objective of this study is to develop an optimized fuzzy logic controller (FLC) for operating an autonomous hybrid green power system (HGPS) based on the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm. An electrolyzer produces hydrogen from surplus energy generated by the wind turbine and photovoltaic array of HGPS for later use by a fuel cell. The PSO algorithm is used to optimize membership functions of the FLC. The FLC inputs are (a) net power flow and (b) batteries state of charge (SOC) and FLC output determines the time for hydrogen production or consumption. Actual data for weekly residential load, wind speed, ambient temperature, and solar irradiation are used for performance simulation and analysis of the HGPS examined. The weekly operation and maintenance (O&M) costs and the loss of power supply probability (LPSP) are considered in the optimization procedure. It is determined that FLC optimization results in (a) reduced fluctuations in batteries SOC which translates into longer life for batteries and the average SOC is increased by 6.18% and (b) less working hours for fuel cell, when the load is met by wind and PV. It is found that the optimized FLC results in lower O&M costs and LPSP by 57% and 33%, respectively, as compared to its un-optimized counterpart. In addition, a reduction of 18% in investment cost is achievable by optimal sizing and reducing the capacity of HGPS equipment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3aambient temperature 3abatteries 3aenergy 3afuel cells 3afuzzy logic 3ahydrogen 3ahydrogen production 3aprobability 3arenewable energy sources 3asolar radiation 3awind speed 3awind turbines 3awork schedules 0aFuzzy logic controller 0aHybrid green power system 0aOptimization 0aOperation and maintenance costs 0aLoss of power supply probability1 aArdehali, M.M.1 aSirizi, M.J.0 tEnergy conversion and management.g2013 Jan., v. 65 p.41-49dElsevier LtdwJournal:11831x0196-89047nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enconman.2012.08.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03499naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002200139245012700161300001600288520216700304592002802471650001902499650002602518650001202544650001602556650001802572650001002590650001802600650001302618650002802631650001502659650001102674650002202685650002202707650001802729650001502747650002102762651001102783700002002794700002202814700002202836773010102858856007302959852000903032655001203041IND60135824120221116160452.0150522e201503  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013582412DNAL7 a10.1111/jvs.122452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBoiffin, Juliette10aEcological controls on post‚Äêfire vegetation assembly at multiple spatial scales in eastern North American boreal forests  ap. 360-372.  aQUESTION: In fire‚Äêprone boreal forests, to what extent does fire severity influence understorey plant community assembly? What are the abiotic and biotic factors controlling understorey community regeneration at regional, landscape and local scales? LOCATION: Black spruce‚Äêdominated boreal forest in eastern Canada. METHODS: A taxonomic and a trait‚Äêbased approach were combined to evaluate the relative influence of habitat characteristics, burn severity and biotic processes on understorey regeneration at multiple spatial scales. Sampling of understorey vegetation cover was carried out in 133 recently burned plots located in 14 different fires across a 600‚Äêkm transect. The spatial hierarchy for sampling consisted of five fire regime zones (regional scale), two to four fires within each zone (landscape) and two to four toposequences within each fire (local). The environmental control of fire severity and habitat characteristics on understorey regeneration was assessed using a canonical redundancy analysis (RDA) and variation partitioning. We investigated environmental and biotic filters of species traits at different scales by modelling trait‚Äìspatial assemblages with Moran eigen vector maps (MEMs). RESULTS: In spite of the large variability of environmental conditions covered by our sampling design, low depths of burn were measured in the large majority of the studied sites. Incomplete consumption of the forest floor is frequently observed in eastern boreal forests characterized by long fire cycles. In situ biological legacies persisted through the low‚Äêseverity fires, which conserved the pre‚Äêfire relationships between plant communities and their environment. As a result, fire severity was neither the unique nor the dominant control on post‚Äêfire regeneration. Habitat characteristics explained a three times higher proportion of variation in species composition. Biotic controls on trait assemblage increased at the two finer scales. CONCLUSIONS: Severity alone cannot predict understorey vegetation assembly at different scales in the low‚Äêseverity fire regime characteristic of the eastern North American boreal forest.  aPublisher supplied data 3aboreal forests 3aenvironmental factors 3afilters 3afire regime 3afire severity 3afires 3aforest litter 3ahabitats 3ainterspecific variation 3alandscapes 3amodels 3aplant communities 3aspecies diversity 3atoposequences 3aunderstory 3avegetation cover 3aCanada1 aAubin, Isabelle1 aMunson, Alison D.1 aRoxburgh, Stephen0 tJournal of vegetation science.g2015 Mar., v. 26, no. 2 p.360-372dOpulus Pressx1100-92337nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jvs.122453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02893naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100001900112245009600131300001400227520147700241592002801718650001901746650001401765650001301779650001901792650002101811650002001832650001301852650000901865650001901874650001501893650001701908650001601925650001401941650002601955650002001981650001802001650001902019650001602038650001402054650001202068653001902080653003002099653001302129653001702142653002002159700001502179700001702194700002202211773012102233852000902354655001202363IND60126573420221122192652.0151124e201402  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012657342DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWegener, Jakob10aNew Methods and Media for the Centrifugation of Honey Bee (Hymenoptera: Apidae) Drone Semen  ap. 47-53.  aCentrifugation of Apis mellifera L. drone semen is a necessary step in the homogenization of semen pools for the enlargement of the effective breeding population, as well as in the collection of semen by the so-called washing technique. It is also of interest for the removal of cryoprotectants after cryopreservation. The adoption of methods involving semen centrifugation has been hampered by their damaging effect to sperm. Here, we tested four new diluents as well as three additives (catalase, hen egg yolk, and a protease inhibitor), using sperm motility and dual fluorescent staining as indicators of semen quality. Three of the new diluents significantly reduced motility losses after centrifugation, as compared with the literature standard. Values of motility and propidium iodide negativity obtained with two of these diluents were not different from those measured with untreated semen. The least damaging diluent, a citrate-HEPES buffer containing trehalose, was then tested in an insemination experiment with centrifuged semen. Most queens receiving this semen produced normal brood, and the number of sperm reaching the storage organ of the queen was not significantly different from that in queens receiving untreated semen. These results could improve the acceptance of techniques involving the centrifugation of drone semen. The diluent used in the insemination experiment could also serve as semen extender for applications not involving centrifugation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aApis mellifera 3aadditives 3acatalase 3acentrifugation 3acryopreservation 3acryoprotectants 3aegg yolk 3ahens 3ahomogenization 3ahoney bees 3ainsemination 3amethodology 3apropidium 3aproteinase inhibitors 3asemen extenders 3asemen quality 3asperm motility 3aspermatozoa 3atrehalose 3awashing 0aApis mellifera 0adual fluorescent staining 0amotility 0ainsemination 0areconcentration1 aMay, Tanja1 aKamp, G&nter1 aBienefeld, Kaspar0 tJournal of economic entomology.g2014 Feb., v. 107, no. 1 p.47-53dEntomological Society of Americax0022-04937nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle02551naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002000149245011600169520128400285592002801569650001201597650001101609650001201620650001501632650001201647650002301659650001701682650001401699650001201713650001901725650001201744650001201756650001301768650001101781650001001792650001401802650001101816700001801827700002001845700002301865773012501888856008302013852000902096655001202105IND60751493520221120062346.0210925e20210715xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075149352DNAL7 a10.3390/fermentation70301162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOkamoto, Kenji 10aDirect Ethanol Production from Xylan and Acorn Using the Starch-Fermenting Basidiomycete Fungus Phlebia acerina  aDuring our search for ethanol-producing basidiomycete fungi for a wide range of substrates, we isolated Phlebia acerina, which is a white rot basidiomycete fungus. It favorably converted starch into ethanol with approximately 70% yield. Although the yield decreased as the starch concentration increased, growth and fermentation were observed even at 200 g/L of starch. P. acerina produced ethanol from glucose, galactose, mannose, xylose, cellobiose, and maltose with 93%, 91%, 86%, 72%, 92%, and 68% yields, respectively. Additionally, P. acerina, which secreted xylanase and xylosidase, was capable of assimilating xylan and directly converting it to ethanol with a yield of 63%. Furthermore, P. acerina produced ethanol directly from acorns, which are plant fruits containing starch and tannins, with a yield of 70%. Tannin delayed mycelia growth, thus prolonging ethanol production; however, this did not particularly affect the yield. These results were similar to those of fermentation in a medium with the same amounts of starch and tannin as the target crop acorn, thus suggesting that P. acerina could successfully produce environmentally friendly ethanol from starch-containing lignocellulosic biomass, unlike previously reported ethanol-producing basidiomycete fungi.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPhlebia 3aacorns 3abiomass 3acellobiose 3aethanol 3aethanol production 3afermentation 3agalactose 3aglucose 3alignocellulose 3amaltose 3amannose 3amycelium 3astarch 3axylan 3axylanases 3axylose1 aGoda, Takato 1 aYamada, Takeru 1 aNagoshi, Masafumi 0 tFermentation.g2021 July 15, v. 7, no. 3dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:26730x2311-56377nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/fermentation70301163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02037naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002000140245011100160300002000271520087500291592002801166650002801194650001501222650001701237650003101254650001501285650001401300700002501314700002501339700002301364700002001387700002701407700002201434773013601456856007401592852000901666655001201675IND60621231720221119184432.0181116e20181115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062123172DNAL7 a10.1039/c8cc07092j2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHarris, Michael10aDrawing on biology to inspire molecular design: a redox-responsive MRI probe based on Gd(iii)-nicotinamide  ap. 12986-12989.  aA novel, reversible redox-active MRI probe, GdNR1, has been developed for the study of redox changes associated with diseased states. This system exhibits switching in relaxivity upon reduction and oxidation of the appended nicotinimidium. Relaxivity studies and cyclic voltammetry confirmed the impressive reversibility of this system, at a biologically-relevant reduction potential. A 2.5-fold increase in relaxivity was observed upon reduction of the complex, which corresponds to a change in the number of inner-sphere water molecules, as confirmed by luminescence lifetimes of the Eu(iii) analogue and NMRD studies. This is the first example of a redox-responsive MRI probe utilising the biologically-inspired nicotinimidium redox switch. In the future this strategy could enable the non-invasive identification of hypoxic tissue and related cardiovascular disease.  aPublisher supplied data 3acardiovascular diseases 3agadolinium 3aluminescence 3amagnetic resonance imaging 3amolybdenum 3aoxidation1 aKolanowski, Jacek L.1 aO‚ÄôNeill, Edward S.1 aHenoumont, C√©line1 aLaurent, Sophie1 aParac-Vogt, Tatjana N.1 aNew, Elizabeth J.0 tChemical communications.g2018 Nov. 15, v. 54, no. 92 p.12986-12989dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26910x1364-548X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c8cc07092j3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03435naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100003200143245013900175500001400314520174300328592002802071650002602099650002302125650001702148650001302165650002502178650001302203650001602216650001702232650002402249650004602273650001702319650002002336650002102356650004302377650002302420650003302443650001602476700002302492700001902515700002602534700002402560700001902584700002602603700002102629700002102650700002902671773011902700856007702819852000902896655001202905IND60729254320221120203424.0210228e20210222xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072925432DNAL7 a10.3390/foods100204752doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPaschoalinotto, Beatriz  H.10aPhytochemical Characterization and Evaluation of Bioactive Properties of Tisanes Prepared from Promising Medicinal and Aromatic Plants  aNAL-light  aThe chemical composition and biological properties correlation in several medicinal and aromatic plants is still underexplored, especially in its most common form of consumption as tisane. The present study aims to characterize the organic acids and vitamin E composition of five tisanes and their extracts by High-Performance Liquid Chromatography coupled to a diode-array detector (HPLC-DAD) and HPLC coupled to a fluorescence detector techniques, respectively, and the phenolic composition by HPLC-DAD-ESI/MS (mass spectrometry by electrospray ionization). It also focuses on their bioactive properties, namely antioxidant, antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, cytotoxic, anti-tyrosinase, and anti-diabetic activities. A Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was performed in order to understand the correlation between the chemical composition and bioactive properties of the tisanes. The tisane 5 (T5) composed by lemon thyme, tutsan, cloves, and cinnamon, was the most promising mixture, presenting the lowest values for the lipid peroxidation inhibition, anti-inflammatory, and anti-diabetic activity. It also presented the highest concentration of phenolic acids (caffeoylquinic acids derivatives), and flavan-3-ols (catechin derivatives). Only the dry plants presented tocopherols. For the antihemolytic, antimicrobial, and cytotoxic activity, T2 and T4 (with lemon thyme) were highlighted as the best herbal mixtures. The PCA proved to be a valid tool to select the most promising tisane according to the bioactivity. These results suggest that the studied tisanes can be source of high added-value bioactive compounds with health-promoting effects and potential for application in the food and nutraceutical industries, among others.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHypericum androsaemum 3aThymus citriodorus 3aantioxidants 3acatechin 3achemical composition 3acinnamon 3acorrelation 3acytotoxicity 3adietary supplements 3aelectrospray ionization mass spectrometry 3afluorescence 3aglycemic effect 3ahealth promotion 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3alipid peroxidation 3aprincipal component analysis 3atocopherols1 aDias, Maria  In√™s1 aPinela, Jos√© 1 aPires, T√¢nia  C.S.P.1 aAlves, Maria  Jos√©1 aMocan, Andrei 1 aCalhelha, Ricardo  C.1 aBarros, Lillian 1 aIneu, Rafael  P.1 aFerreira, Isabel  C.F.R.0 tFoods.g2021 Feb. 22, v. 10, no. 2dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21651x2304-81587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/foods100204753Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03456naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005800148245008100206520202900287592002802316650002102344650002802365650001302393650002502406650002102431650001702452650001102469650001902480650002402499650001902523650001702542651001002559653002702569700001702596700001602613700001302629700001302642700001302655700005502668700002402723700001402747700001602761773011702777856008302894852000902977655001202986IND60742359820221118070239.0210909e202109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074235982DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ufug.2021.1272372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Jingwen1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5478-169910aHealth promoting green infrastructure associated with green space visitation  aWith rapid urbanization globally, people in cities tend to have fewer opportunities to interact with nature. Some health-promoting green infrastructure may support increased visitation.To investigate associations between green space visitation and a range of health promoting green infrastructure.From November 2019 to January 2020, we conducted a population-based cross-sectional study in Shenzhen, China. Patients diagnosed with hypertension aged 35 years or older managed by community health centers for one year were recruited. A stratified multi-stage cluster random sampling method was applied to select a representative sample of 1 158 participants. A well-structured questionnaire was applied to obtain information. Participants were surveyed face-to-face (response rate 96.4 %; n‚ÄØ=‚ÄØ1,116 participants) by trained interviewers. Binary logistic regression model was used to analyze the relationship between green space visitation and a range of health promoting green infrastructure.The rate of visiting green space was 87.5 % (976/1,116). The rate of visiting green space for at least 30‚ÄØmin per week was 85.5 % (954/1,116). The rate of visiting green space for at least 120‚ÄØmin per week was 78.2 % (873/1,116). Green space with walking trails [OR(95 %CI): 2.322(1.501,3.591)], group exercise venue [OR(95 %CI): 1.546(1.034,2.312)] mean higher odds of people with hypertension visiting green space. Green space with fitness area availability was positively associated with cumulative green space visitation of 30‚ÄØmin or more a week [OR(95 %CI): 1.652(1.115,2.447)]. Health knowledge promotion area was associated with greater odds of visiting green space at least 120‚ÄØmin per week [OR(95 %CI): 1.529(1.124,2.079)].Walking trails, health knowledge promotion areas, fitness areas and group exercise venue are associated with higher levels of green space visitation at health-relevant cumulative durations. Our findings have significance for urban greening strategies that aim to maximize population health.  aPublisher supplied data 3acommunity health 3across-sectional studies 3aexercise 3agreen infrastructure 3ahealth promotion 3ahypertension 3apeople 3aquestionnaires 3aregression analysis 3aurban forestry 3aurbanization 3aChina 0aGreen space visitation1 aFeng, Xiaoqi1 aShi, Wenhui1 aCui, Jia1 aPeng, Ji1 aLei, Lin1 aZhang, Juan1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5478-16991 aAstell-Burt, Thomas1 aJiang, Yu1 aMa, Jixiang0 tUrban forestry & urban greening.g2021 Sept., v. 64 p.127237-dElsevier GmbHwJournal:jnl893556x1618-86677nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ufug.2021.1272373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02910naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002400151245020200175520137900377592002801756650002601784650002301810650001701833650001901850650002001869650001001889650001701899650002001916650001801936650000701954650001801961650002001979650001601999653004002015653003302055653003202088653003302120653003402153653003902187700002002226700002002246773009102266856008602357852000902443655001202452IND60679585520221118212354.0210806e20200501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067958552DNAL7 a10.1016/j.talanta.2019.1206732doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPieckowski, Micha≈Ç10aCombination of large volume sample stacking with polarity switching and cyclodextrin electrokinetic chromatography (LVSS-PS-CDEKC) for the determination of selected preservatives in pharmaceuticals  aIn this study, a large volume sample stacking (LVSS) with polarity switching (PS) and cyclodextrin electrokinetic chromatography (CDEKC) method has been developed for the simultaneous separation and determination of 8 preservatives: methylparaben (MP), ethylparaben (EP), propylparaben (PP), butylparaben (BP), isobutylparaben (IBP), sorbic acid (SA), benzoic acid (BA), p-hydroxybenzoic acid (PHBA) in pharmaceuticals. The effects of some typical parameters such as sample volume, applied voltage, composition and pH of the running buffer and organic modifier concentration were examined and optimized. Moreover, the impact of type and concentration of cyclodextrin as electrolyte modifiers was also investigated. The detection limits of analytes for the elaborated LVSS-PS-CDEKC method were found to be in 0.8‚Äì5¬†ng¬†mL‚Åª¬π range, which were around 500 times lower than normal CDEKC without preconcentration technique. All analytes were completely resolved in less than 11¬†min in an uncoated fused-silica capillary of 75¬†Œºm internal diameter (I.D) x 50¬†cm length. The electrophoretic separation was performed in a 2¬†mM Œ±-cyclodextrin and 25¬†mM tetraborate system (pH¬†=¬†9.3) with an applied voltage of 25¬†kV. The established method was validated and confirmed to be applicable for the determination of the preservatives in a quality control of pharmaceuticals.  aPublisher supplied data 3a4-hydroxybenzoic acid 3aalpha-cyclodextrin 3abenzoic acid 3achromatography 3adetection limit 3adrugs 3aelectrolytes 3aelectrophoresis 3amethylparaben 3apH 3apreservatives 3aquality control 3asorbic acid 0aOn-line preconcentration techniques 0aLarge volume sample stacking 0aPreservative quantification 0aHighly-sulfated cyclodextrin 0aElectrokinetic chromatography 0aQuality control of pharmaceuticals1 aKowalski, Piotr1 aBƒÖczek, Tomasz0 tTalanta.g2020 May 01, v. 211 p.120673-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11742x0039-91407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.talanta.2019.1206733Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03127naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002100149245009900170520171400269592002801983650002202011650001002033650001302043650001702056650001702073650001102090650001702101650001302118650001402131650000702145650002302152650002202175650000802197650002302205650001102228651001602239700001602255700001702271700002302288700002802311700001902339700001802358700002002376700002002396773012502416856008302541852000902624655001202633IND60751493720221120062343.0210925e20210623xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075149372DNAL7 a10.3390/fermentation70301002doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlderson, Hazel 10aSensory Profile of Kombucha Brewed with New Zealand Ingredients by Focus Group and Word Clouds  aKombucha is a yeast and bacterially fermented tea that is often described as having an acetic, fruity and sour flavour. There is a particular lack of sensory research around the use of Kombucha with additional ingredients such as those from the pepper family, or with hops. The goal of this project was to obtain a sensory profile of Kombucha beverages with a range of different ingredients, particularly of a novel Kombucha made with only Kawakawa (Piper excelsum) leaves. Other samples included hops and black pepper. Instrumental data were collected for all the Kombucha samples, and a sensory focus group of eight semi-trained panellists were set up to create a sensory profile of four products. Commercially available Kombucha, along with reference training samples were used to train the panel. Kawakawa Kombucha was found to be the sourest of the four samples and was described as having the bitterest aftertaste. The instrumental results showed that the Kawakawa Kombucha had the highest titratable acidity (1.55 vs. 1.21‚Äì1.42 mL) as well as the highest alcohol percentage (0.40 vs. 0.15‚Äì0.30%). The hops sample had the highest pH (3.72 vs. 3.49‚Äì3.54), with the lowest titratable acidity (1.21), and, from a basic poll, was the most liked of the samples. Each Kombucha had its own unique set of sensory descriptors with particular emphasis on the Kawakawa product, having unique mouthfeel descriptors as a result of some of the compounds found in Kawakawa. This research has led to a few areas that could be further studied, such as the characteristics of the Piperaceae family under fermentation and the different effects or the foaminess of the Kawakawa Kombucha, which is not fully explained.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEuthynnus affinis 3aPiper 3aalcohols 3ablack pepper 3afermentation 3aflavor 3afocus groups 3akombucha 3amouthfeel 3apH 3asensory evaluation 3ataste sensitivity 3atea 3atitratable acidity 3ayeasts 3aNew Zealand1 aLiu, Chang 1 aMehta, Annu 1 aGala, Hinal Suresh1 aMazive, Natalia Rutendo1 aChen, Yuzheng 1 aZhang, Yuwei 1 aWang, Shichang 1 aServenti, Luca 0 tFermentation.g2021 June 23, v. 7, no. 3dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:26730x2311-56377nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/fermentation70301003Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02270naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100001500112245014900127300001400276520096800290592002801258650002401286650004501310650001101355650001401366650001301380650002101393650001901414650001401433650001201447650000901459653004501468653002401513653002101537653001701558653001901575700001501594700001801609700001301627700001801640700001601658700002001674773012101694852000901815655001201824IND60126573720221120090756.0151124e201402  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012657372DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Jie10aSouthern Rice Black-Streaked Dwarf Virus Infection Improves Host Suitability for Its Insect Vector, Sogatella furcifera (Hemiptera: Delphacidae)  ap. 92-97.  aThe impact of southern rice black-streaked dwarf virus (SRBSDV) on the life cycle of the vector Sogatella furcifera (Horv√°th) (Hemiptera: Delphacidae) was investigated. The adult longevity was significantly shorter when the insect was reared on the SRBSDV-infected rice plants than those reared on the noninfected rice treatment. The fecundity of S. furcifera reared on the SRBSDV-infected rice plants was slightly higher than that of those reared on the noninfected rice plants both in macropterous and brachypterous cohorts. In addition, SRBSDV infection in rice increased the population size of macropterous adults from both macropterous and brachypterous cohorts. After a 10 or 15 d feeding period on the SRBSDV-infected rice plants, the amount of honeydew excreted by the insect increased significantly when compared with those reared on the noninfected plants.

The adsorption performance was experimentally investigated and compared. The experiment results are that mass recovery process can improve cooling capacity significantly while heat recovery process can improve coefficient of performance (COP) more significantly. The silica gel/LiCl-methanol cooling system has higher adsorption capacity and working pressure.

However, the processes underlying weed community assembly within a crop type are poorly understood, especially regarding the contributions of local factors and stochastic processes. In this study, we investigate the effects of the crop type in shaping local weed communities. LOCATION: LTER Zone Atelier Plaine et Val de S√®vre, an intensive cereal system in western France. METHODS: We selected 105 fields of five crop types and investigated the functional structure of weed communities for those traits that define the Leaf‚ÄìHeight‚ÄìSeed (L‚ÄêH‚ÄêS) strategy as well as phenological traits. We compared the observed trait distribution to trait distributions expected under random assembly. The trait distributions were described by the range, the community‚Äêweighted mean and the dispersion of each trait, and simulated communities were generated with a null model approach that randomizes the ‚Äòspecies¬†√ó¬†traits‚Äô matrix to maintain equiprobable the occurrence of each trait combination. The relationship between trait values and species abundance within each community was investigated using Kendall rank correlation tests. RESULTS: Our results showed that, in ca. 90% of the fields, the functional diversity of weed communities did not differ from what would be expected under random assembly. Departures from random expectations essentially resulted from shifts in weighted mean values for phenological traits. Weed communities of sunflower, maize and spring pea had later onsets of emergence and flowering than randomly expected. Communities of winter wheat had smaller species and earlier onset of flowering, and communities from oilseed rape had a larger duration of the emergence period and earlier onset of flowering. In addition, we found a positive significant relationship between species abundance and trait values for phenology for spring pea, sunflower and maize, suggesting that species with a later onset of emergence and flowering period have higher performance in these weed communities. CONCLUSIONS: At landscape scale, weed communities generally showed patterns of functional diversity in accordance with those expected under random community assembly, except for phenological traits in spring and summer crops, where patterns were rather consistent with environmental filtering.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBrassica napus 3aHelianthus annuus 3aagroecosystems 3acorn 3acrops 3aflowering 3afunctional diversity 3alandscapes 3apeas 3aphenology 3aspring 3astochastic processes 3asummer 3atesting 3aweeds 3awinter wheat 3aFrance1 aLe Corre, Val√©rie1 aBretagnolle, Vincent1 aGaba, Sabrina1 aDuarte, Leandro0 tJournal of vegetation science.g2015 Mar., v. 26, no. 2 p.348-359dOpulus Pressx1100-92337nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jvs.122383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02635naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100006400150245006900214520122700283592002801510650001301538650002701551650001901578650001201597650001501609650002001624650001601644650001101660650002701671653002101698653001601719653003701735653004301772653003301815700006301848773024401911856008502155852000902240655001202249IND60742360020221118070127.0210911e202109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074236002DNAL7 a10.1016/j.repbio.2021.1005302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTekayev, Muhammetnur1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1407-619910aClinical values and advances in round spermatid injection (ROSI)  aAzoospermia is defined as the complete absence of sperm cells in the ejaculate. Approximately 10‚Äì15 % of infertile men display azoospermia. Azoospermia can be subdivided into two types, obstructive azoospermia (OA) and non-obstructive azoospermia (NOA). NOA azoospermia might be the result due to primary testicular damage, secondary testicular damage, or incomplete testicular development. NOA azoospermia accounts for a considerable proportion of male infertility. A significant percentage of men with NOA azoospermia have foci of active spermatogenesis up to the stage of round spermatid. Round spermatid injection (ROSI) is a technique of assisted in-vitro fertilization (IVF) in assisted reproductive technology (ART). ROSI technique involves the injection of haploid germ cells derived from testicular biopsies into the recipient oocytes. The present study demonstrates that more participants and long-term follow-up studies are required to assess the reliability of the ROSI technique. In order to increase the success rate of the ROSI technique, round spermatids should be correctly evaluated and selected. Our study refers to the clinical values, challenges, and innovations in round spermatid injection (ROSI).  aPublisher supplied data 3ahaploidy 3ain vitro fertilization 3amale sterility 3aoocytes 3aspermatids 3aspermatogenesis 3aspermatozoa 3atestes 3atesticular development 0aMale infertility 0aAzoospermia 0aRound spermatid injection (ROSI) 0aAssisted reproductive technology (ART) 0aIn-vitro fertilization (IVF)1 aVuruskan, Ayse Kose1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4136-30140 tReproductive Biology.g2021 Sept., v. 21, no. 3 p.100530-dElsevier B.V.aSociety for Biology of Reproduction & the Institute of Animal Reproduction and Food Research of Polish Academy of Sciences in OlsztynwJournal:23206x1642-431X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.repbio.2021.1005303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02824naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001600152245008800168300001600256520161200272592002801884650001501912650001901927650001801946650003001964650002401994650001602018653002702034653002602061653002402087653001802111653001802129653001302147653000902160653000802169700001502177700001402192773011202206856008702318852000902405655001202414IND60096630520221121190841.0221004e201301  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009663052DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enconman.2012.09.0172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, H.G.10aHeat transfer analysis of a finned-tube evaporator for engine exhaust heat recovery  ap. 438-447.  aThe organic Rankine cycle (ORC) can be used to recover waste heat from an internal combustion engine. In such a system, the evaporator design is critical. Determining the amount of heat that can be transferred in a designed evaporator is extremely important for a successful ORC system. In this paper, the performance of a finned-tube evaporator used to recover exhaust waste heat from a diesel engine is presented. First, the exhaust heat of the chosen diesel engine is evaluated based on the measured data. Subsequently, a mathematical model of the evaporator is created based on the detailed geometry and the specific ORC working conditions. Then, the heat transfer of the evaporator is estimated as the diesel engine runs through all of its operating regions defined by the engine speed and the engine load. The results show that the exhaust temperature at the evaporator outlet increases with engine speed and engine load. Although the convective heat transfer coefficient of the organic working fluid is significantly larger than that of the exhaust gas, the overall heat transfer coefficient is slightly greater than that of the exhaust gas. Furthermore, the heat transfer rate is the greatest in the preheated zone and least in the superheated zone. Consequently, the heat transfer area for the preheated zone is nearly half of the total area. In addition, the area of the superheated zone is slightly greater than that of the two-phase zone. It is concluded that the heat transfer area for a finned tube evaporator should be selected carefully based on the engine‚Äôs most typical operating region.  aPublisher supplied data 3acombustion 3adiesel engines 3aheat transfer 3aheat transfer coefficient 3amathematical models 3atemperature 0aFinned-tube evaporator 0aOrganic Rankine cycle 0aWaste heat recovery 0aDiesel engine 0aHeat transfer 0ab.s.f.c. 0aLMTD 0aORC1 aWang, E.H.1 aFan, B.Y.0 tEnergy conversion and management.g2013 Jan., v. 65 p.438-447dElsevier LtdwJournal:11831x0196-89047nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enconman.2012.09.0173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02916naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245010000168300001600268500001500284520170700299592002802006650001502034650002602049650002702075650001302102650001702115650001602132650001702148650001802165650001302183650004302196650002202239653001802261700002302279700002302302773010302325856008102428852000902509655001202518IND50072804120221119214658.0150212e201402  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007280412DNAL7 a10.1007/s10811-013-0132-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchmid, Matthias10aFatty acid contents and profiles of 16 macroalgae collected from the Irish Coast at two seasons  ap. 451-463.  a2019-12-06  aDue to the established health benefits of omega-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC-PUFA), there is a globally increasing demand for alternative natural resources with appropriate fatty acid profiles. To assess the suitability of macroalgae as a source, 16 species (nine Phaeophyceae, five Rhodophyta and two Chlorophyta) were collected at two seasons (June and November) from the Irish west Coast, and total fatty acid contents and specific profiles were determined. Total fatty acid contents, expressed per percentage of dry weight, ranged from 6.4¬†%‚Äâ¬±‚Äâ0.3 (Pelvetia canaliculata, Phaeophyceae) to 0.8¬†%‚Äâ¬±‚Äâ0.2 (Porphyra dioica, Rhodophyta). Most common fatty acids were palmitic (16:0), oleic (OLE, 18:1 n-9), Œ±-linolenic (ALA, 18:3 n-3), arachidonic (ARA, 20:4 n-6) and eicosapentaenoic (EPA, 20:5 n-3) acids. Fatty acid profiles were highly variable between and within algal groups; red and brown seaweeds were generally richer in LC-PUFA (e.g. 20:4 n-6 and 20:5 n-3), while high levels of saturated fatty acids such as palmitic acid (16:0) were observed in green species. Most omega-3 PUFA-rich species investigated had a omega-6/omega-3 fatty acid ratio close to 1, which is favourable for human health. The two seasonal sampling times revealed significant differences in total fatty acid and 20:5 n-3 (EPA) contents, with changes depending on species, thus implying varying suitability as potential target species for EPA production. At both times of the year, Palmaria palmata was identified as most promising species as a source of 20:5 n-3 (EPA) amongst all species investigated, with levels ranging from 0.44 to 0.58¬†% of dry weight in June and November, respectively.  aPublisher supplied data 3amacroalgae 3aeicosapentaenoic acid 3afatty acid composition 3aPorphyra 3aPhaeophyceae 3aChlorophyta 3ahuman health 3apalmitic acid 3aPalmaria 3along chain polyunsaturated fatty acids 3anatural resources 0aChlorophycota1 aGuih√©neuf, Freddy1 aStengel, Dagmar B.0 tJournal of applied phycology.g2014 Feb., v. 26, no. 1 p.451-463dSpringer-Verlagx0921-89717nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10811-013-0132-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02447naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245011000168520120400278592002801482650000801510650001601518650002001534650001701554650002101571650001101592650002001603650001301623650001801636650002601654650001401680653009701694700001701791700001901808700001801827700001701845773009201862856008601954852000902040655001202049IND60679585720221118212330.0200210e20200401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067958572DNAL7 a10.1016/j.talanta.2019.1206772doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Hongyu10aSimultaneous fluorescent detection of multiplexed miRNA of liver cancer based on DNA tetrahedron nanotags  aThe level of miRNA-21, miRNA-122, and miRNA-223 are always elevated when liver cancer is present at an early stage. In this paper, a novel assay to simultaneous detect miRNA-21, miRNA-122, and miRNA-223 was proposed based on DNA tetrahedron nanotags and fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET), which used a single laser stimulate wavelengh from one nucleic acid stain TOTO-1 to three diverse organic dyes (Cy3, Cy3.5, Cy5). In brief, a DNA tetrahedral nanostructure (DTN) was designed with three adaptor oligos on its vertices. TOTO-1, as a fluorescent donor, can imbed into native nucleic acid backbone of DTN. Three organic dye-functionalized strands (FRET oligos) are fluorescent receptors. In the presence of target miRNAs, they can be hybridized with FRET oligos and adaptor oligos on the vertices of DTN and the stable DNA tetrahedron nanotags are formed. As a result, the confinement of TOTO-1 is in close proximity to three fluorescence dyes, the FRET between TOTO-1 and three fluorescence dyes is generate efficiently in DNA tetrahedron nanotags. Point-of-care clinical applicability is demonstrated by sensitive multiplexed quantification of three miRNAs in 10% human serum samples.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3ablood serum 3aenergy transfer 3afluorescence 3afluorescent dyes 3ahumans 3aliver neoplasms 3amicroRNA 3ananomaterials 3apoint-of-care systems 3areceptors 0amiRNA ¬∑ liver cancer ¬∑ FRET ¬∑ DNA tetrahedron nanotag ¬∑ clinical applicability ¬∑ TOTO-11 aWang, Minhui1 aXiong, Xiaohui1 aLiu, Yuanjian1 aChen, Xiaoye0 tTalanta.g2020 Apr. 01, v. 210 p.120677-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11742x0039-91407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.talanta.2019.1206773Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02686naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245012400165520138500289592002801674650001601702650001901718650001101737650002001748650002101768650001401789650001101803650003001814653001801844653002001862653001901882653001301901653002601914700001501940700001801955700001601973700002001989700001402009700001602023773012102039856008302160852000902243655001202252IND60783867320221121092302.0220809e202210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078386732DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cbpc.2022.1094172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShi, Yanhong10aExposure to amitriptyline induces persistent gut damages and dysbiosis of the gut microbiota in zebrafish (Danio rerio)  aAmitriptyline (AMI), the most commonly prescribed tricyclic antidepressant, is widely detected in water environments. Exposure to AMI may lead to diverse adverse effects on aquatic organisms, but little is known about the effect of short-term exposure to AMI on the gut microbiota of aquatic organisms and their recovery characteristics. In the present study, adult zebrafish (Danio rerio) were exposed to AMI (0, 2.5, 10, and 40¬†Œºg/L) for seven days, and then allowed to recover in AMI-free culture water for 21¬†days. The exposure caused gut damages in all the AMI treated groups of zebrafish, which became more severe after recovery compared to the control group. AMI exposure also disturbed the microbiota of zebrafish guts and rearing water even after the 21-day recovery period. Furthermore, AMI exposure affected microbes involved in the substance and energy metabolic functions in zebrafish guts and tended to increase the abundance of microbial genera associated with opportunistic pathogens. In addition, the microbial predicted metabolic functions in AMI-exposed guts of zebrafish were significantly altered after the 21-day recovery period, explaining the persistent effects of short-term exposure to AMI. The results of this study suggest that acute exposure to AMI may have persistent impacts on the gut histomorphology and the gut microbiota in aquatic organisms.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDanio rerio 3aacute exposure 3aadults 3aantidepressants 3adigestive system 3adysbiosis 3aenergy 3aintestinal microorganisms 0aAmitriptyline 0aAdult zebrafish 0aGut microbiota 0aRecovery 0aEmerging contaminants1 aChen, Chen1 aWu, Xiangyang1 aHan, Ziming1 aZhang, Shanshuo1 aChen, Kun1 aQiu, Xuchun0 tComparative biochemistry and physiology.g2022 Oct., v. 260 p.109417-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12414x1532-04567nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cbpc.2022.1094173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02623naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002700139245015300166300001600319500001100335520163100346592002801977650001802005650001302023650002102036650002002057650001402077650001702091773013002108856007402238852000902312655001202321IND60788498820221122053219.0220814e201808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078849882DNAL7 a10.1002/ncp.100042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlhagamhmad, Moftah H.10aEnteral Nutrition in the Management of Crohn's Disease: Reviewing Mechanisms of Actions and Highlighting Potential Venues for Enhancing the Efficacy  ap. 483-492.  aREVIEW  aCrohn's disease (CD) is a chronic condition that affects the gut and has adverse effects on growth and development. There is a global increase in the incidence and prevalence rates, and several factors are believed to contribute to this rise, including dietary habits. In contrast, the use of enteral nutrition (EN) as an exclusive source of nutrition is increasingly becoming the preferred induction treatment of pediatric CD patients in part to address the nutrition complications. However, EN therapy is considered less effective in adults with CD. A better understanding of the molecular mechanisms of enteral therapy will help improve the clinical management of CD. It is increasingly becoming evident that the therapeutic utility of EN is in part due to the reversal of the microbial changes and the direct immunomodulatory effects. Moreover, there is a potential tendency for enhancing the efficacy of EN therapy by improving the palatability of the given formulas and, more important, by magnifying the anti‚Äêinflammatory properties. Recent observations have shown that the immunomodulatory effects of EN are mediated at least in part by blocking nuclear factor‚ÄêŒ∫B. Furthermore, it is likely that several ingredients of EN contribute to this activity, in particular glutamine and arginine amino acids. In addition, manipulating the composition of EN therapy by altering concentrations of the key ingredients is found to have the potential for more efficient therapy. In this review, the underlying mechanisms of EN actions will be discussed further with a focus on the potential methods for enhancing the efficacy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCrohn disease 3aarginine 3adigestive system 3aenteral feeding 3aglutamine 3apalatability0 tNutrition in clinical practice.g2018 Aug., v. 33, no. 4 p.483-492dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl39209x0884-53367nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ncp.100043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02409naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002300149245014200172520127400314592002801588650002701616650001301643650002301656650001201679650000701691650003301698650001601731650001401747650001801761700002201779700002001801700002101821773012501842856008301967852000902050655001202059IND60751493920221120062506.0210925e20210716xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075149392DNAL7 a10.3390/fermentation70301182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTsigoriyna, Lidia 10aHighly Efficient 2,3-Butanediol Production by Bacillus licheniformis via Complex Optimization of Nutritional and Technological Parameters  a2,3-Butanediol (2,3-BD) is a reagent with remarkable commercial use as a platform chemical in numerous industries. The present study aims to determine the capabilities of non-pathogenic and cellulolytic Bacillus licheniformis 24 as a 2,3-BD producer. By applying the Plackett‚ÄìBurman design and response surface methodology through central composite design (CCD), a complex optimization of medium and process parameters was conducted. Thus, among ten studied factors of medium content, four components were evaluated with a significant positive effect on 2,3-BD formation. Their optimal values for 2,3-BD production (yeast extract, 13.38 g/L; tryptone, 6.41 g/L; K‚ÇÇHPO‚ÇÑ, 4.2 g/L; MgSO‚ÇÑ, 0.32 g/L), as well as the optimal temperature (37.8 ¬∞C), pH (6.23) and aeration rate (3.68 vvm) were predicted by CCD experiments and validated in a series of batch processes. In optimized batch fermentation of 200 g/L of glucose 91.23 g/L of 2,3-BD was obtained, with the overall productivity of 1.94 g/L/h and yield of 0.488 g/g. To reveal the maximum 2,3-BD tolerance of B. licheniformis 24, fed-batch fermentation was carried out. The obtained 138.8 g/L of 2,3-BD with a yield of 0.479 g/g and productivity of 1.16 g/L/h ranks the strain among the best 2,3-BD producers.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillus licheniformis 3aaeration 3abatch fermentation 3aglucose 3apH 3aresponse surface methodology 3atemperature 3atryptones 3ayeast extract1 aGanchev, Dimitar 1 aPetrova, Penka 1 aPetrov, Kaloyan 0 tFermentation.g2021 July 16, v. 7, no. 3dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:26730x2311-56377nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/fermentation70301183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03170naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245008400167300001600251520188700267592002802154596004002182650002102222650002202243650001502265650001502280650001202295650001302307650002502320650001302345650002502358650001702383650001502400700001802415700002202433700001602455700005502471773014202526856008302668852000902751655001202760IND60711429720221122090023.0210814e202010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071142972DNAL7 a10.1007/s10342-020-01287-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSheffer, Efrat10aConsequences of pine colonization in dry oak woodlands: effects on water stress  ap. 817-828.  aThe potential impacts of species colonization on the structure and functioning of ecosystems are poorly understood. We propose a novel approach for understanding the consequences of habitat colonization, highlighting the influence of colonists on the availability of limiting resources to resident species. We studied how colonization of dry oak woodlands by pines (Pinus halepensis) is affecting water stress of resident oaks (Quercus calliprinos). We monitored predawn leaf water potential (PLWP) of oaks monthly for 2¬†years. Using maximum likelihood and multi-model inference, we evaluated how the PLWP of oaks was affected by pine colonists. The influence of colonizing pines on PLWP of resident oaks varied in time and space from negative to positive depending on season, oak size, pine size, and proximity to pines presence. The water stress of oaks increased along the dry season (‚àí¬†1.5 to ‚àí¬†4.5¬†MPa), with small oaks becoming more severely stressed than large ones (up to 60% difference). During the dry season, neighboring pine colonists increased the water stress of oaks (up to ‚àí¬†0.4¬†MPa difference), but during the wet season, they reduced the water stress mainly for large oaks. Our findings indicate that pine colonization differentially affects water limitation for resident oaks with implications for future development and regeneration. The influence of pine colonists shifted from positive to negative along an increasing water stress gradient, contrary to predictions by the stress gradient hypothesis. Our work demonstrates how colonization by non-resident species can influence key ecosystem processes through the redistribution of limiting resources. Identifying these processes is fundamental for understanding the consequences of colonization, mitigating these influences, and predicting future change in the structure and function of ecosystems.  aPublisher supplied data  a#514/10cIsraeli Science Foundation 3aPinus halepensis 3aQuercus coccifera 3adry season 3aecosystems 3aforests 3ahabitats 3aleaf water potential 3aresearch 3astatistical analysis 3awater stress 3awet season1 aCooper, Arnon1 aPerevolotsky, Avi1 aMoshe, Yosi1 aOsem, Yagil1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0315-67000 tEuropean journal of forest research.g2020 Oct., v. 139, no. 5 p.817-828dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl3870054x1612-46697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10342-020-01287-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02436naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100001500154245008600169300001600255520149800271592002801769650001201797650001101809651001001820700001501830700001501845700001901860700001801879773010501897856008802002990002302090852000902113655001202122IND60096131120221119202253.0141104e201103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009613112DNAL7 a10.1016/j.compbiomed.2011.01.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Wufang10aDevelopment and evaluation of a computerized Mandarin speech test system in China  ap. 131-138.  aObjectives: This study reports the development and evaluation of a Computerized Mandarin Speech Test System (CMSTS). Methods: Taking into account the rules for developing speech materials and the unique linguistic characteristics of Mandarin, we designed and digitally recorded a set of materials comprised of seven lists of monosyllabic words, nine lists of disyllabic words, and fifteen lists of sentences with a high degree of subject familiarity. The CMSTS was developed with Visual Studio 2008, Access 2003 and DirectX 9. The system included five functions: listener management, a speech test, list management, data management, and system settings. We used the system to measure the speech recognition threshold (SRT) of 76 participants with normal hearing (age range: 20‚Äì28 years), and measured performance-intensity functions (PI) for all stimuli. Results: The SRT results were in accord with pure-tone results obtained by pure-tone audiometry. In a speech recognition score (SRS) test, changing the presentation level had the strongest effect on sentence recognition, followed by the presence of disyllabic words. Monosyllabic words were least affected by changes in presentation level. The slopes of the linear portion of the PI using the system were in accord with the findings of previous studies using audiometers and CDs with similar materials. Conclusion: The CMSTS has sufficient sensitivity, and can facilitate the wider use of speech audiometry in Chinese audiology clinics.  aPublisher supplied data 3ahearing 3aspeech 3aChina1 aZhang, Hua1 aChen, Jing1 aChen, Jianyong1 aLin, Changyan0 tComputers in Biology and Medicine.g2011 Mar., v. 41, no. 3 p.131-138dElsevier Ltdx0010-48257nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.compbiomed.2011.01.0023Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02915naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001600139245010700155300001600262520165500278592002801933650001201961650001201973650001101985650001901996650001602015650002202031650001502053650002702068650001502095650004002110650002302150650002102173650001502194650001102209650001202220650001102232651001002243700001202253700002102265773010102286856007302387852000902460655001202469IND60135824820221116160343.0150522e201503  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013582482DNAL7 a10.1111/jvs.122362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuang, Gang10aPhenological transition dictates the seasonal dynamics of ecosystem carbon exchange in a desert steppe  ap. 337-347.  aQUESTION: There are large variations in ecosystem carbon (C) exchange in desert ecosystems; however, few studies have examined the effects of community phenological staging on seasonal variations of ecosystem C exchange. We asked whether factors that control temporal changes in net ecosystem C exchange (NEE) vary with an obvious community transition from spring annuals to summer annuals and perennials in a temperate desert steppe. LOCATION: South margin of the Gurbantunggute Desert, northwestern China. METHODS: Ecosystem C and water exchange were measured regularly using closed static chambers and analysed at daily and seasonal intervals. Soil moisture and temperature, photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) and plant biomass were also investigated. RESULTS: Soil temperature had a dominant influence on C release into the atmosphere from the ecosystem during the snowmelting phase (mid‚ÄêMarch to early April). In the spring annual dominant phase (mid‚ÄêApril to early June), the diurnal pattern of NEE was consistent with the pattern of PAR. The ecosystem became a weak C resource (0.16¬†¬±¬†0.03¬†Œºmol¬†CO‚ÇÇ¬†m‚Åª¬≤¬∑s‚Åª¬π) and NEE was positively correlated with community biomass during this phase. In the summer annual and perennial dominant phase (late June to late September), NEE showed relatively large C release (0.74¬†¬±¬†0.03¬†Œºmol¬†CO‚ÇÇ¬†m‚Åª¬≤¬∑s‚Åª¬π) and was negatively correlated with soil temperature. CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that the primary abiotic factor controlling NEE varies throughout the year, and NEE is determined by the interaction of a plant functional group with precipitation and temperature.  aPublisher supplied data 3aannuals 3abiomass 3acarbon 3acarbon dioxide 3acorrelation 3adiurnal variation 3aecosystems 3anet ecosystem exchange 3aperennials 3aphotosynthetically active radiation 3aseasonal variation 3asoil temperature 3asoil water 3aspring 3asteppes 3asummer 3aChina1 aLi, Yan1 aCollins, Beverly0 tJournal of vegetation science.g2015 Mar., v. 26, no. 2 p.337-347dOpulus Pressx1100-92337nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jvs.122363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03188naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002000146245009600166300001600262500002000278520184600298592002802144650001602172650001602188650001602204650001502220650002002235650001502255650001902270650002302289650001402312650001402326650000902340650001202349650001902361700002002380700002202400700001702422700001902439710006402458773013002522856008102652852000902733655001202742IND60788499120221121115107.0220814e201808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078849912DNAL7 a10.1177/08845336177196702doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNucci, Anita M.10aSurvey of Nutrition Management Practices in Centers for Pediatric Intestinal Rehabilitation  ap. 528-538.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aBackground: Nutrition management of pediatric intestinal failure (IF) requires interdisciplinary coordination of parenteral nutrition (PN) and enteral nutrition (EN) support. Nutrition strategies used by specialists in pediatric intestinal rehabilitation to promote gut adaptation and manage complications have not been previously summarized. Methods: A practice survey was distributed to members of the dietitian subgroup of the American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition Pediatric Intestinal Failure Section. The survey included 24 open‚Äêended questions related to PN and enteral feeding strategies, nutrition management of PN‚Äêassociated liver disease, and laboratory monitoring. Results: Dietitians from 14 centers completed the survey. Management components for patients at risk for cholestasis were consistent and included fat minimization, trace element modification, avoiding PN overfeeding, and providing EN. Parenteral amino acid solutions designed for infants/young children are used in patients <1 or 2 years of age. Trace minerals are dosed individually in 10 of 14 centers. Eleven centers prescribe a continuous infusion of breast milk or elemental formula 1‚Äì2 weeks after resection while 3 centers determine the formula type by the extent of resection. Most (86%) centers do not have a protocol for initiating oral/motor therapy. Laboratory panel composition varied widely by center. The selection and frequency of use depended on clinical variables, including cholestatic status, exclusive vs partial PN dependence, postrepletion verification vs routine monitoring, intestinal anatomy, and acuity of care. Conclusion: EN and PN management strategies are relatively consistent among U.S. centers. Collaborative initiatives are necessary to define better practices and establish laboratory monitoring guidelines.  aPublisher supplied data 3aamino acids 3abreast milk 3acholestasis 3adietitians 3aenteral feeding 3aintestines 3aliver diseases 3aparenteral feeding 3aprotocols 3aresection 3arisk 3asurveys 3atrace elements1 aEllsworth, Kipp1 aMichalski, Austin1 aNagel, Emily1 aWessel, Jackie2 aon behalf of the ASPEN Pediatric Intestinal Failure Section0 tNutrition in clinical practice.g2018 Aug., v. 33, no. 4 p.528-538dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl39209x0884-53367nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1177/08845336177196703Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02154naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100001900112245011000131300001600241506002800257520095900285592002801244506003701272650001701309650002401326650001601350650001401366650002801380650000701408650001601415650000901431650002501440650001101465651001401476653001801490653001401508653002201522653001101544653001601555653001101571773014101582852000901723655001201732IND60774207220221207112139.0101104e200909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077420722DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNurkanto, Arif10aCellulolitic Activities of Actinomycetes Isolated From Soil Rhizosphere of Waigeo, Raja Ampat, West Papua  ap. 239-244.  aResource is Open Access  aSeven actinomycetes isolated from Waigeo‚Äôs soil rhizosphere have been characterized in growth, cellulase activities and pH.

In this research, we investigated the impact of an acute transient heat stress on the resistance of the wheat line ‚ÄòMolly,‚Äô which contains the R gene H13, to an avirulent Hessian fly (Mayetiola destructor (Say)) population. We found that a significant portion of Molly seedlings stressed at 40¬∞C for 6 h during or after the initial Hessian fly larval attack became susceptible to otherwise avirulent insects, whereas unstressed control plants remained 100% resistant. Specifically, 77.8,73.3,83.3, and 46.7% of plants heat stressed at 0,6,12, and 24 h, respectively, after the initial larval attack became susceptible. Biochemical analysis revealed that heat stress caused a transient decrease in 12-oxo-phytodienoic acid, but an increase in salicylic acid accumulation in Molly plants. The change in phytohormones after heat stress and Hessian fly infestation was not observed in ‚ÄòNewton,‚Äô a near-isogenic but Hessian fly susceptible wheat line. Instead, heat stress caused a relatively prolonged reduction in palmitoleic acid. The role of phytohormones in heat-induced loss of wheat resistance was discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMayetiola destructor 3aPoaceae 3agenes 3aheat stress 3ainsect infestations 3ainsects 3alarvae 3apalmitoleic acid 3aparasites 3aplant hormones 3asalicylic acid 3aseedlings 3awheat 0aheat stress 0awheat 0aHessian fly 0aloss of resistance 0aphytohormone1 aMoch, John1 aUnderwood, Joshua1 aKharabsheh, Hamzah1 aQuesenberry, Amy1 aMiyagi, Risa1 aMcHugh, Carolyn,1 aBoney, Melanie1 aWoods, Samantha1 aChen, Ming-Shun1 aZhu, Lieceng0 tJournal of economic entomology.g2014 Feb., v. 107, no. 1 p.389-395dEntomological Society of Americax0022-04937nnas  aUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle02808naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001800152245011300170300001600283520172800299592002802027650001402055650002402069650001602093653003202109653003302141653003002174653003002204700001802234700002202252773011202274856008702386852000902473655001202482IND60096631120221121065259.0221004e201301  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009663112DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enconman.2012.07.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPosa, Antonio10aAnalysis of a directional hydraulic valve by a Direct Numerical Simulation using an immersed-boundary method  ap. 497-506.  aThe improvement of the hydraulic valves depends on the careful analysis of the coherent structures driving the motion of the working fluid. In the past those devices have been studied by experimental tests; during the last 15years also several numerical works have been presented, solving the flow on body-fitted computational grids by RANS methods.¬†In this study a different approach is proposed for the axisymmetric analysis of a directional valve (4/3, closed center): whereas the RANS techniques are based on the time-averaged equations of the flow, in the present work the unsteady Navier‚ÄìStokes equations have been solved using the Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS), which provides important details on the instantaneous structures of the flow, affecting the valve performance. Furthermore, while in the previous numerical studies the computational domain has been discretized by conformal grids, in this case the fluid-body interaction has been represented by an immersed-boundary (IB) method on a Cartesian grid.¬†The analysis of the discharge coefficient and the flow forces for different openings s and pressure drops Œîp is presented in this paper. The behavior of those global parameters is justified also considering the time-averaged and the instantaneous fields. For small openings and pressure drops the flow is steady and attached to the wall of the discharge chamber on the side of the restricted section. When s and Œîp are increased the jet separates at the restricted section and it re-attaches downstream (Coanda effect), keeping the steady state. Finally, for large openings and pressure drops the flow becomes strongly unsteady: it is organized like a free jet and is dominated by large vortices.  aPublisher supplied data 3aequations 3amathematical models 3asteady flow 0aDirect Numerical Simulation 0aDirectional hydraulic valves 0aFinite-difference methods 0aImmersed-boundary methods1 aOresta, Paolo1 aLippolis, Antonio0 tEnergy conversion and management.g2013 Jan., v. 65 p.497-506dElsevier LtdwJournal:11831x0196-89047nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enconman.2012.07.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02624naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001800152245009000170520094400260592002801204650002101232650002601253650002901279650001901308650002301327650001701350650003701367650003001404650002501434653000801459653000801467653001201475653001401487653001301501653003301514653002001547653000801567653000901575653000801584653000901592653000801601653000701609653000701616653001901623653001401642653001201656653003201668653001801700700001201718700001701730700001701747700001701764700001501781700001801796773010001814856008701914852000902001655001202010IND60785998620221117012840.0220830e20221215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078599862DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2022.1338202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDiao, Mengxue10aCharacterization and antibacterial activity study of Œ±-Lactalbumin-carvacrol complex  aFood contamination and poisoning caused by bacteria will endanger human health, and the development of natural antibacterial agents is a pressing issue.

Computer simulations have shown that van der Waals forces dominate the interaction between ALA and Car. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of Car toward Gram-negative Escherichia coli was decreased from 336¬†Œºg/mL to 224¬†Œºg/mL after binding to ALA. It had little effect on the MIC of Gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus (224¬†Œºg/mL), but further proved Car had a weaker antibacterial activity than the ALA-Car complex by the spread plate method.

Species composition was recorded across 54 sites comprising meadows, mown meadows and grazed grasslands located within the ‚ÄòBiodiversity Exploratories‚Äô project areas in three different regions of Germany. New species were selected for enrichment planting in the plots according to four different scenarios: species with highly similar or dissimilar traits, species with the highest degree of co‚Äêoccurrence (derived from vegetation records held in the German vegetation reference database) and randomly chosen species. The changes in community mean trait distances brought about by enrichment planting and the transplant survival were related to land‚Äêuse intensity. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: Land use was found to be an important environmental filter, as mean trait distance consistently declined with increasing land‚Äêuse intensity across all scenarios. The planted species with the highest probability of co‚Äêoccurrence with the resident species did not change the mean pair‚Äêwise trait distances across all plots, which indicates that they reflected the same degree of environmental filtering as the resident species. Accordingly, the species that commonly co‚Äêoccur with the resident species survived best. These findings open a new avenue for using vegetation databases to assess the relative importance of environmental filtering.  aPublisher supplied data 3adatabases 3aland use 3ameadows 3aplant communities 3aplanting 3aprobability 3aspecies diversity 3asurvival rate 3atesting 3aGermany1 aJandt, Ute1 aBruelheide, Helge1 aBruun, Hans Henrik0 tJournal of vegetation science.g2015 Mar., v. 26, no. 2 p.219-232dOpulus Pressx1100-92337nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jvs.122353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01628naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245008900167300001600256520062700272592002800899650002900927650001900956650001500975650001900990650001001009650001801019650001101037650001601048700002001064700002201084700002101106773009401127856004801221852000901269655001201278IND50061298220221118013129.0130318e201210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006129822DNAL7 a10.1134/S19950829120400742doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFefilova, E.

It was found that the annual dynamics of plankton communities took place, but their composition and structure were saved. However, some current features of tundra-lake zooplankton can be indicative of the directed development of ecosystems and the start of their eutrophication. These processes take place against the background of the attenuation of the anthropogenic impact on water bodies and certain trends in climate change. The studied lakes were oligo- and mesotrophic.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanthropogenic activities 3aclimate change 3aecosystems 3aeutrophication 3alakes 3asurface water 3atundra 3azooplankton1 aKononova, O.

This method enabled us to simultaneously control the surface density of porphyrins, the distance between the electrode surface and porphyrins, and the atomistic structure of Au‚ÄìS junctions. The Au‚ÄìS binding sites were determined to be twofold bridge configuration at Au(100) and Au(110) and threefold hollow configuration at Au(111). Photoinduced uphill charge transfer under potentiostatic control was measured for these well-defined molecular assemblies. The quantum efficiency of photocurrent generation was higher at Au(100) and Au(110) than at Au(111), showing that the Au‚ÄìS junction is more conductive at the bridge binding site than at the hollow binding site. This difference is well explained by the electronic coupling strength of Au‚ÄìS junctions. For efficient photo-energy conversion in organic photovoltaic devices, the metal‚Äìorganic contact barrier can be reduced by controlling the atomistic structures of the interface.  aPublisher supplied data 3aelectric current 3aelectrodes 3agold 3ametalloporphyrins1 aSato, Shino1 aUosaki, K≈çhei,1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8886-32701 aMotobayashi, Kenta1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3090-21121 aIkeda, Katsuyoshi1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3704-98980 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2020 July 23, v. 124, no. 33 p.18173-18180dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23573x1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.0c065293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03509naa a2200841 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245010300169300001600272520145800288592002801746650001501774650002501789650001701814650001301831650001801844650001601862650001601878650001001894650003501904650002701939650001101966650001901977650001901996650002002015650001302035650001502048653000802063653002002071653002502091653001502116653001102131653000602142653000702148653000802155653000802163653001002171653000802181653000802189653000902197653000802206653000802214653000902222653000802231653000802239653000902247653000802256653000902264653001002273653000702283653000802290653000902298653000802307653000802315653001302323653000602336653000802342653000702350653000602357653000802363700001302371700001402384700002002398700001902418773012402437856008502561852000902646655001202655IND60561424720221121104220.0190410e201703  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056142472DNAL7 a10.1016/j.plaphy.2017.01.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Dongyue,10aTomato SlGGP-LIKE gene participates in plant responses to chilling stress and pathogenic infection  ap. 218-226.  aPlants are always exposed to abiotic and biotic stresses which can adversely affect their growth and development. As an important antioxidant, AsA plays a vital role in plant defence against damage caused by stresses. In this study, we cloned a tomato GDP-L-galactose phosphorylase-like (SlGGP-LIKE) gene and investigated its role in resistance to abiotic and biotic stresses by using antisense transgenic (AS) tomato lines. The AsA content in AS plants was lower than that in WT plants. Under chilling stress, the growth of AS plants was inhibited significantly, and they yielded higher levels of ROS, REC and MDA but demonstrated weaker APX activity than that shown by WT plants. Additionally, the declined values of Pn, Fv/Fm, oxidisable P700, and D1 protein content of PSII in AS lines were significant. Furthermore, the effect on xanthophyll cycle of AS plants was more severe than that on WT plants, and the ratio of zeaxanthin (Z)/(V¬†+¬†A¬†+¬†Z) and (Z¬†+¬†0.5¬†A)/(V¬†+¬†A¬†+¬†Z) in AS lines was lower than that in WT plants. In spite of chilling stress, under Pseudomonas syringae pv.tomato (Pst) DC3000 strain infection, AS plants showed lesser bacterial cell growth and dead cells than those shown by WT plants. This finding indicated that AS plants demonstrated stronger resistance against pathogenic infection. Results suggest that SlGGP-LIKE gene played an important role in plant defence against chilling stress and pathogenic infection.  aPublisher supplied data 3aD1 protein 3aPseudomonas syringae 3aantioxidants 3abacteria 3abiotic stress 3acell growth 3acold stress 3agenes 3agenetically modified organisms 3agrowth and development 3alutein 3aphotosystem II 3aplant response 3aprotein content 3atomatoes 3azeaxanthin 0aAsA 0aChilling stress 0aPathogenic infection 0aSlGGP-LIKE 0aTomato 0aA 0aAS 0aCSN 0aDTT 0aFv/Fm 0aGDP 0aGGP 0aHPLC 0aICS 0aMDA 0aNPR1 0aORF 0aPBS 0aPMSF 0aPR1 0aPSII 0aO2‚àí 0aPn 0aPFD 0aPVDF 0aREC 0aROS 0aSDS-PAGE 0aV 0aVDE 0aWT 0aZ 0aZEP1 aLi, Meng1 aMa, Na-Na1 aYang, Xing-Hong1 aMeng, Qing-Wei0 tPlant physiology and biochemistry.g2017 Mar., v. 112 p.218-226dElsevier Masson SASwJournal:jnl41590x0981-94287nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.plaphy.2017.01.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02900naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001800145245011700163300002000280520154100300592002801841650001901869650001701888650001101905650001701916650001101933650001101944650001101955650000901966650002301975650001001998650001802008650002202026650001002048650001502058650003102073650003302104650001002137650000902147650002302156700001602179700001502195700001902210773010102229856007902330852000902409655001202418IND60459360220221122093725.0151109e201511  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6045936022DNAL7 a10.1111/1750-3841.130722doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDing, Xiaofei10aChanges in Volatile Compounds of Chinese Luzhou‚ÄêFlavor Liquor during the Fermentation and Distillation Process  ap.

Physicochemical properties analysis of Zaopei (fermented grains [FG], fermented grains mixed with sorghum [FGS], streamed grains [SG], and streamed grains mixed with Daqu [SGD]) showed distinct changes. A total number of 66 volatile compounds in the Zaopei were identified, in which butanoic acid, hexanoic acid, ethyl hexanoate, ethyl lactate, ethyl octanoate, hexyl hexanoate, ethyl hydrocinnamate, ethyl oleate, ethyl hexadecanoate, and ethyl linoleate were considered to be the dominant compounds due to their high concentrations. FG had the highest volatile compounds (112.43 mg/kg), which significantly decreased by 17.05% in the FGS, 67.12% in the SG, and 73.75% in the SGD. Furthermore, about 61.49% of volatile compounds of FGS were evaporated into raw liquor, whereas head, heart, and tail liquor accounted for 29.84%, 39.49%, and 30.67%, respectively. Each volatile class generally presented a decreasing trend, except for furans. Especially, the percentage of esters was 55.51% to 67.41% in the Zaopei, and reached 92.60% to 97.67% in the raw liquor. Principal component analysis based ordination of volatile compounds data segregated FGS and SGD samples. In addition, radar diagrams of the odor activity values suggested that intense flavor of fruit was weakened most from FG to SGD.  aPublisher supplied data 3achromatography 3adistillation 3aesters 3afermentation 3aflavor 3afurans 3agrains 3ahead 3aheadspace analysis 3aheart 3ahexanoic acid 3amass spectrometry 3aodors 3aoleic acid 3aphysicochemical properties 3aprincipal component analysis 3aradar 3atail 3avolatile compounds1 aWu, Chongde1 aHuang, Jun1 aZhou, Rongqing0 tJournal of food science.g2015 Nov., v. 80, no. 11 p.C2373-C2381dThe Institutex0022-11477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1750-3841.130723Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03250naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100006100147245014400208300001800352500001400370520163000384592002802014650002802042650001302070650002102083650001302104650001802117650001302135650002002148650001002168650001502178650002202193650001002215650002202225650001602247650001702263650001702280650002902297653001502326653001702341653001402358653002002372653002402392653001202416653001502428700001402443700002202457700001802479773012102497856008102618852000902699655001202708IND60707713320221118184143.0200820e202009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070771332DNAL7 a10.1017/S00311820200009182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBenoit, Joshua B.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4018-351310aInteractions with ectoparasitic mites induce host metabolic and immune responses in flies at the expense of reproduction-associated factors  ap. 1196-1205.  aNAL-light  aParasites cause harm to their hosts and represent pervasive causal agents of natural selection. Understanding host proximate responses during interactions with parasites can help predict which genes and molecular pathways are targets of this selection. In the current study, we examined transcriptional changes arising from interactions between Drosophila melanogaster and their naturally occurring ectoparasitic mite, Gamasodes queenslandicus. Shifts in host transcript levels associated with behavioural avoidance revealed the involvement of genes underlying nutrient metabolism. These genetic responses were reflected in altered body lipid and glycogen levels in the flies. Mite infestation triggered a striking immune response, while male accessory gland protein transcript levels were simultaneously reduced, suggesting a trade-off between host immune responses to parasite challenge and reproduction. Comparison of transcriptional analyses during mite infestation to those during nematode and parasitoid attack identified host genes similarly expressed in flies during these interactions. Validation of the involvement of specific genes with RNA interference lines revealed candidates that may directly mediate fly‚Äìectoparasite interactions. Our physiological and molecular characterization of the Drosophila‚ÄìGamasodes interface reveals new proximate mechanisms underlying host‚Äìparasite interactions, specifically host transcriptional shifts associated with behavioural avoidance and infestation. The results identify potential general mechanisms underlying host resistance and evolutionarily relevant trade-offs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDrosophila melanogaster 3aNematoda 3aRNA interference 3abody fat 3aectoparasites 3aglycogen 3aimmune response 3amales 3ametabolism 3amite infestations 3amites 3anatural selection 3aparasitoids 3aparasitology 3areproduction 3atranscription (genetics) 0aDrosophila 0aectoparasite 0aGamasodes 0anutrient levels 0aparasite resistance 0aRNA-seq 0atrade-offs1 aBose, Joy1 aBailey, Samuel T.1 aPolak, Michal0 tParasitology.g2020 Sept., v. 147, no. 11 p.1196-1205dCambridge University PresswJournal:jnl45572x1469-81617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S00311820200009183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02499naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245011300166520108400279592002801363650001001391650001301401650001801414650002201432650001301454650001501467650001901482650001101501650002101512650002001533650001901553650002101572653001601593653002401609653002601633653002601659700001801685700001601703700001801719700001401737700001401751700001501765700002101780773012201801856008501923852000902008655001202017IND60758366220221122123816.0211219e20211225xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075836622DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecoenv.2021.1130312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMao, Yuxuan10aEnhancement of algae ponds for rural domestic sewage treatment by prolonging daylight using artificial lamps  aAlgal ponds (APs) are widely used as treatment facilities for domestic sewage in sparsely populated rural areas. However, few AP studies have focused on daylight length to enhance pollutants removal. In this study, four algae ponds were set up, daylight was prolonged by 0, 2, 4, and 6¬†h with an illuminating intensity of 3000¬†lx. The highest removal efficiencies of total nitrogen, ammonium, and total phosphorus were 37.36%, 41.20%, and 21.56% due to the highest microbial abundance under optimum conditions (2¬†h PD), respectively. Excessive PD (4¬†h and 6¬†h) could inhibit the removal abilities. PD also increased the maximum relative electron transport rate of algae, leading to an increase in the photosynthetic capacity of APs. Meanwhile, the high microbial abundance indicates that chemoheterotrophic bacteria are the main influencing factor for the removal of nitrogen and phosphorus by the APs. Moreover, the system with PD using artificial lamps was proven to be feasible for engineering applications and potentially utilized in rural domestic wastewater treatment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgae 3aammonium 3aecotoxicology 3aelectron transfer 3anitrogen 3aphosphorus 3aphotosynthesis 3asewage 3asewage treatment 3asolar radiation 3atotal nitrogen 3atotal phosphorus 0aAlgae ponds 0aProlonging daylight 0aRural domestic sewage 0aMicrobial communities1 aTan, Hongfang1 aWang, Kemei1 aZhang, Yejian1 aJin, Zhan1 aZhao, Min1 aLi, Yiqing1 aZheng, Xiangyong0 tEcotoxicology and environmental safety.g2021 Dec. 25, v. 228 p.113031-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:1984x0147-65137nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoenv.2021.1130313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03002naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100005400144245017900198300002000377500001900397520148500416592002801901650001601929650001501945650002401960650001901984650001902003650001702022650001502039650002202054650002502076650001602101653002902117653001602146653002602162653002802188653001602216700005402232700005302286773014202339856007802481852000902559655001202568IND60718698720221118170732.0201125e20201113xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071869872DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.0c133862doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZheng, Han1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5982-759310aIncorporation of Core‚ÄìShell-Structured Zwitterionic Carbon Dots in Thin-Film Nanocomposite Membranes for Simultaneously Improved Perm-Selectivity and Antifouling Properties  ap. 53215-53229.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe development of highly efficient thin-film nanocomposite (TFN) membranes with superior water permeability, maintained rejection performance, and excellent antifouling capacity is critical to meeting the ever-escalating demand for fresh water. Herein, carbon dots (CDs) grafted with hyperbranched zwitterions, denoted as CDs-ZPEI‚ÇÄ.‚ÇÜ‚Äì‚ÇÅ‚ÇÄ‚Çñ, were first prepared by the hydrothermal treatment of citric acid in the presence of zwitterionic hyperbranched polyethylenimine (ZPEI‚ÇÄ.‚ÇÜ‚Äì‚ÇÅ‚ÇÄ‚Çñ) with different molecular weights (0.6, 1.8, and 10 kDa). Subsequently, the synthesized nanoparticles were introduced in membrane fabrication to form CDs-ZPEI‚ÇÄ.‚ÇÜ‚Äì‚ÇÅ‚ÇÄ‚Çñ-embedded TFN (TFN-CDs-ZPEI‚ÇÄ.‚ÇÜ‚Äì‚ÇÅ‚ÇÄ‚Çñ) membranes. The grafted shells of superhydrophilic ZPEI not only increased the chemical compatibility of CDs in the polyamide layer to suppress the formation of nonselective voids but also created a densely packed network for efficient water transportation and effective divalent salt rejection. The TFN-CDs-ZPEI‚ÇÅ‚ÇÄ‚Çñ membrane demonstrated a 2.8-fold enhancement in the permeate flux with an increased Na‚ÇÇSO‚ÇÑ rejection rate of 98.1% and improved antifouling properties than the pristine thin-film composite (TFC) membrane. This work provides an insight into the development of functionalized core‚Äìshell structured nanoparticles to effectively overcome the permeability-selectivity trade-off limitations and fouling problems in TFC membranes.  aPublisher supplied data 3acitric acid 3afreshwater 3ahot water treatment 3ahydrophilicity 3ananocomposites 3apermeability 3apolyamides 3apolyethyleneimine 3awater transportation 3azwitterions 0athin-film nanocomposites 0acarbon dots 0azwitterionic polymers 0acore‚àíshell structures 0aantifouling1 aMou, Zihao1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1359-51761 aZhou, Kun1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7660-29110 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2020 Nov. 13, v. 12, no. 47 p.53215-53229dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.0c133863Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02355naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245007900166300001600245520143300261592002801694650001401722650001101736650000901747650001701756650002301773650001501796651001501811700002101826773010401847856008101951852000902032655001202041IND50068960120221123040252.0150208e201309  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006896012DNAL7 a10.1007/s12665-012-2167-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aG√ºll√º, Hamza10aPerformance of fine-grained soil treated with industrial wastewater sludge  ap. 777-788.  aThis paper is likely one of the very recent researches based on an experimental study, which aims to investigate some geotechnical performances of fine-grained soil treated with industrial wastewater sludge. The experimental program conducts the standard compaction, direct shear, California bearing ratio (CBR), and unconfined compressive strength (UCS) tests. The sludge proportions in samples of the soil¬†+¬†sludge mixtures are 0, 5, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, and 80¬†% by dry weight of the mixture. The results indicate that the internal friction angle of untreated soil is significantly enhanced at most of the sludge dosages (p¬†<¬†0.05). The CBR values offer that the soil quality can be improved to ‚Äúgood‚Äù rating quality to use ‚Äúbase‚Äù layers in stabilizations up to the 50¬†% sludge dosage. The contribution is also obtained by the UCS values that increase with the sludge addition. Moreover, the stress‚Äìstrain responses promise to develop the ductility behavior due to the sludge inclusion. Consequently, the soil mixtures treated with the sludge have exhibited satisfactory geotechnical characteristics. Thus, this study suggests that the industrial wastewater sludge can be potentially employed for improvement of fine-grained soil in the stabilizations. The proposed soil stabilization with locally available industrial wastewater sludge can also provide recycling and sustainability to the environment.  aPublisher supplied data 3arecycling 3asludge 3asoil 3asoil quality 3asoil stabilization 3awastewater 3aCalifornia1 aGirisken, Serkan0 tEnvironmental earth sciences.g2013 Sept., v. 70, no. 2 p.777-788dSpringer-Verlagx1866-62807nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12665-012-2167-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02392naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004500094040001800139100005800157245014300215300001300358520099000371592002801361650001001389650003101399650002401430650001701454650001501471650002301486650001701509653002301526653001401549653001601563653001601579653001601595700002501611700002601636700005801662700001901720700002001739773011001759856009201869852000901961655001201970IND60747201620221121125444.0211129e202110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074720162DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biosystemseng.2021.07.0172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMaffia, Jacopo1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3968-610510aAssessing particulate matter (PM10) emissions from outdoor runs in laying hen houses by integrating wind tunnel and lab-scale measurements  ap. 1-12.  aLaying hen houses are a known source of fine particulate matter (PM‚ÇÅ‚ÇÄ), but no information is available on the contribution of outdoor runs to the overall emissions. This study aims to investigate some of the main factors driving PM emissions from outdoor runs. A wind tunnel device was built to assess the effect of hen density (HD, hens m‚Åª¬≤) on PM emissions from outdoor runs. Moreover, a laboratory trial, using a soil resuspension chamber, was conducted to describe the influence of soil moisture on the emissions. The gathered information was then used to estimate PM‚ÇÅ‚ÇÄ emissions over a 1-year period. PM emissions increased exponentially with increasing HD and decreased exponentially with increasing soil water content. The average PM‚ÇÅ‚ÇÄ emissions from hen activities at the study farm, estimated using meteorological data from year 2019, were of 8.9¬†mg hen‚Åª¬π d‚Åª¬π. This emission is much lower than those reported by previous studies for indoor hens rearing.  aPublisher supplied data 3afarms 3alaboratory experimentation 3ameteorological data 3aparticulates 3asoil water 3asoil water content 3awind tunnels 0aParticulate matter 0aEmissions 0aLaying hens 0aArea source 0aWind tunnel1 aAarnink, Andr√© J.A.1 aPloegaert, Johan P.M.1 aDinuccio, Elio1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9808-73211 aBalsari, Paolo1 aEllen, Hilko H.0 tBiosystems engineering.g2021 Oct., v. 210 p.1-12dElsevier LtdaIAgrEwJournal:jnl70639x1537-51107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biosystemseng.2021.07.0173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02521naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002400147245009400171300001800265500001400283520136600297592002801663650002301691650001501714650002001729650001801749650002201767650001701789650001801806650001401824653001501838653001201853653001601865700005501881773012101936856008102057852000902138655001202147IND60707713420221118184325.0200820e202009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070771342DNAL7 a10.1017/S003118202000092X2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMarucha, K.

Several Opisthokont Pumilio domain proteins are known to suppress expression when bound to mRNAs. The Trypanosoma brucei Pumilio domain protein PUF3 is a cytosolic mRNA-binding protein that suppresses expression when tethered to a reporter mRNA. RNA-binding studies showed that PUF3 preferentially binds to mRNAs with a classical Pumilio-domain recognition motif, UGUA[U/C]AUU. RNA-interference-mediated reduction of PUF3 in bloodstream forms caused a minor growth defect, but the transcriptome was not affected. Depletion of PUF3 also slightly delayed differentiation to the procyclic form. However, both PUF3 genes could be deleted in cultured bloodstream- and procyclic-form trypanosomes. Procyclic forms without PUF3 also grew somewhat slower than wild-type, but ectopic expression of C-terminally tagged PUF3 impaired their viability. PUF3 was not required for RBP10-induced differentiation of procyclic forms to bloodstream forms. Mass spectrometry revealed no PUF3 binding partners that might explain its suppressive activity. We conclude that PUF3 may have a role in fine-tuning gene expression. Since PUF3 is conserved in all Kinetoplastids, including those that do not infect vertebrates, we suggest that it might confer advantages within the invertebrate host.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTrypanosoma brucei 3ablood flow 3agene expression 3ainvertebrates 3amass spectrometry 3aparasitology 3atranscriptome 3aviability 0amRNA decay 0aPumilio 0atranslation1 aClayton, C.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6384-07310 tParasitology.g2020 Sept., v. 147, no. 11 p.1171-1183dCambridge University PresswJournal:jnl45572x1469-81617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S003118202000092X3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01870naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131100001800149245011200167300001600279520086400295592002801159650002001187650001901207650001201226650001601238650001301254650002001267650002101287700002201308700002101330773009901351856008501450852000901535655001201544IND4458578820221119174652.0141112e20110627xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445857882DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scienta.2011.04.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBorse, Nilesh10aStability of micropropagated Musa acuminata cv.

Both types of markers revealed high degree of monomorphism. Very low variation was observed up to the eighth subculture generation with polymorphic bands being low in both ISSR (0.96%) and REMAP (0.95%) markers. Epigenetic stability was studied by DNA methylation analysis of the eighth subculture generation samples. Single 570bp methylation sensitive band was absent in two of the fifteen MspI predigested samples, while it was present in HpaII predigested and undigested samples.

They are potential reservoirs of various zoonotic agents. This study was conducted in Bouira, a north-central region of Algeria. A total of 21 Atelerix algirus corpses were picked up on roadsides and gardens. Hedgehog kidneys, spleens and ectoparasites were collected. Twelve hedgehogs were infested with ectoparasites, including Archaeopsylla erinacei, Rhipicephalus sanguineus s.l. and Haemaphysalis erinacei. Hedgehog organs and randomly selected arthropods were screened for microorganisms using molecular methods. Coxiella burnetii was detected in kidneys, spleens, A. erinacei, Hae. erinacei and Rh. sanguineus s.l. Leptospira interrogans was detected in kidneys. Rickettsia felis and Rickettsia massiliae were detected respectively in A. erinacei and in Rh. sanguineus s.l. DNA of an uncultivated Rickettsia spp. was found in Hae. erinacei. Wolbachia spp. DNA was detected in fleas. The DNA of potential new Bartonella and Ehrlichia species were found respectively in fleas and ticks. This study highlights the presence of DNA from a broad range of microorganisms in hedgehogs and their ectoparasites that may be responsible for zoonoses in Algeria.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArchaeopsylla erinacei 3aAtelerix 3aBartonella 3aCoxiella burnetii 3aDNA 3aEhrlichia 3aHaemaphysalis 3aLeptospira interrogans 3aRhipicephalus sanguineus 3aRickettsia felis 3aRickettsia massiliae 3aWolbachia 3aimmunology 3azoonoses 3aAlgeria 0aHedgehogs 0aTicks 0aFleas 0aMicroorganisms1 aBenkacimi, Linda1 aZan Diarra, Adama1 aLaroche, Maureen1 aB√©renger, Jean-Michel1 aBitam, Idir1 aParola, Philippe0 tComparative immunology, microbiology, and infectious diseases.g2022 Jan., v. 80 p.101726-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12359x0147-95717nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cimid.2021.1017263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03577naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002200148245008600170300001600256520211200272592002802384650001402412650003002426650001702456650001002473650002702483650001402510650002502524650001502549650001102564650001102575650002102586650002202607650001302629650001402642650001302656650001502669650002102684650001502705650001702720650002202737653001802759653002102777653001402798653001902812700002102831773011502852856008302967852000903050655001203059IND60747201820221121125547.0211001e202109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074720182DNAL7 a10.1016/j.rama.2021.07.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWittman, Tessa M.12aA Synthesis of Research on the Human Dimensions of Sagebrush Ecosystem Management  ap. 155-164.  aTo protect species of concern in rangeland systems, managers and policy makers must understand the human dimensions of the ecosystems those species rely on. Sagebrush (Artemesia spp. L.) ecosystems are among the most extensive rangelands in the western United States and have been of particular concern in recent years due to the decline of greater sage-grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus) and other sagebrush obligate species. While there is a substantial body of literature on the biophysical aspects of sagebrush ecosystems, the human dimensions of sagebrush management are not well understood and social science research is distributed throughout a wide range of journals and disciplines. We used systematic review principles to conduct a synthesis of literature to assess existent knowledge on the human dimensions of sagebrush management and conservation and to identify areas for future research. We cast a broad net to include studies from economics, political science, social psychology, sociology, governance, anthropology, and other fields. Using Web of Science and search terms sourced from our research questions and relevant stakeholders, we identified 78 studies meeting the following criteria: 1) the research was conducted within the distribution of North American sagebrush and 2) the research included social science methods. We coded the 78 studies to identify the focus of research on resource issue(s), social issue(s), geographical region, and additional research needs. The literature focused on resource issues primarily related to fire, land use, sage-grouse, and rangeland management, while social issues emphasized collaboration, stakeholder perceptions and attitudes, and modes of governance. Research gaps include assessments of the longevity and ecological impacts of collaboration, perceptions and attitudes surrounding wild horse and burro management, and governance approaches to managing invasives and ecological restoration. Research that includes input from Native Nations is lacking, and inclusive social science relevant to diverse stakeholders in sagebrush is overdue.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArtemisia 3aCentrocercus urophasianus 3aanthropology 3aasses 3aecological restoration 3aeconomics 3aecosystem management 3agovernance 3ahorses 3ahumans 3ainvasive species 3aissues and policy 3aland use 3alongevity 3apolitics 3apsychology 3arange management 3arangelands 3astakeholders 3asystematic review 0acollaboration 0acontent analysis 0asagebrush 0asocial science1 aBennett, Drew E.0 tRangeland ecology & management.g2021 Sept., v. 78 p.155-164dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl44569x1550-74247nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rama.2021.07.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02177naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002300144245010700167300002000274500001900294520090700313592002801220650002401248650001501272650001301287650001301300653002601313653002901339653001701368653002901385653002001414700002401434700002101458700006001479700002301539773014201562856007801704852000901782655001201791IND60718699020221118170719.0201125e20201116xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071869902DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.0c135402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSingh, Braj Bhusan10aHigh Spin to Charge Conversion Efficiency in Electron Beam-Evaporated Topological Insulator Bi‚ÇÇSe‚ÇÉ  ap. 53409-53415.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aBi‚ÇÇSe‚ÇÉ is a well-established topological insulator (TI) having spin momentum locked Dirac surface states at room temperature and predicted to exhibit high spin to charge conversion efficiency (SCCE) for spintronics applications. The SCCE in TIs is characterized by an inverse Edelstein effect length (ŒªIREE). We report an ŒªIREE of ‚àº0.36 nm, which is the highest ever observed in Bi‚ÇÇSe‚ÇÉ. Here, we performed spin pumping and inverse spin Hall effect (ISHE) in an electron beam-evaporated Bi‚ÇÇSe‚ÇÉ/CoFeB bilayer. The Bi‚ÇÇSe‚ÇÉ thickness dependence of ŒªIREE, perpendicular surface anisotropy (KS), spin mixing conductance, and spin Hall angle confirmed that spin to charge conversion is due to spin momentum locked Dirac surface states. We propose that the role of surface states in SCCE can be understood by the evaluation of KS. The SCCE is found to be high when the value of KS is small.  aPublisher supplied data 3aambient temperature 3aanisotropy 3amomentum 3atopology 0atopological insulator 0ainverse spin Hall effect 0aspin pumping 0ainverse Edelstein effect 0aspin Hall angle1 aJena, Sukanta Kumar1 aSamanta, Manisha1 aBiswas, Kanishka1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9119-24551 aBedanta, Subhankar0 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2020 Nov. 16, v. 12, no. 47 p.53409-53415dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.0c135403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02654naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001700149245015300166500002200319520126300341592002801604650001601632650001801648650002501666650002101691650002101712650001301733650002001746650001001766650001301776650000901789650001601798650000901814651001601823653006001839653001501899653001901914653002701933653001201960700002001972700002001992773009202012856008302104852000902187655001202196IND60565851220221122223458.0170712s2017    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056585122DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ibiod.2017.03.0192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee, Hyun Ju10aWood injury characteristics of fungi isolated from printing woodblocks of the Tripitaka Koreana in the Haeinsa Temple at Hapcheon, Republic of Korea  aPre-press version  aWe investigated the wood-damaging characteristics of microorganisms by conducting decay tests on the surface of woodblocks made from the wood of Prunus sargentii, with the aim of identifying ways to preserve the woodblocks. The microorganisms were classified into 29 types of fungi and 6 types of bacteria. Among them 11 types of fungi showed high wood-degrading enzyme activity, and hence classified under risk levels 2‚Äì3. We also found that the anti-mold effect of P.¬†sargentii was low, based on the finding that surface contaminants such as Eupenicillium rubidurum and Penicillium oxalicum grew on the P.¬†sargentii specimen. In addition, these strains were grew on the surface of a lacquered P.¬†sargentii specimen, and the anti-mold effect of the lacquer did not seem to correlate with the number of lacquer applications. The P.¬†sargentii specimen was found to have a higher weight loss rate than a Pinus densiflora specimen, which indicated that the preservative effect of P.¬†sargentii against Coprinellus radians was low. However, the weight loss rate of the lacquered P.¬†sargentii specimen was low, and mycelium was not observed in the wood tissue. In conclusion, we believe that lacquer exerts a preservative effect on P.¬†sargentii specimens.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCoprinellus 3aEupenicillium 3aPenicillium oxalicum 3aPinus densiflora 3aPrunus sargentii 3abacteria 3aenzyme activity 3afungi 3amycelium 3arisk 3aweight loss 3awood 3aSouth Korea 0aPrinting woodblocks of the Tripitaka Koreana in Haeinsa 0aWood-decay 0aBiodegradation 0aInjury characteristics 0aLacquer1 aJeong, Seon hye1 aChung, Yong jae0 tInternational Biodeterioration & Biodegradation.g2017, dElsevier Ltdx0964-83057nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ibiod.2017.03.0193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02447naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001600140245014100156300002000297520122400317592002801541650001101569650002201580650001501602650001201617650001501629650001401644650001301658650001101671650001601682700001501698700001501713700001701728700001601745700001701761700001801778700001401796773014401810856007401954852000902028655001202037IND60674772520221119220337.0191030e20191029xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067477252DNAL7 a10.1039/c9ta08130e2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Chengbo10aEmerging alkali metal ion (Li‚Å∫, Na‚Å∫, K‚Å∫ and Rb‚Å∫) doped perovskite films for efficient solar cells: recent advances and prospects  ap. 24150-24163.  aMetal halide perovskite materials have drawn worldwide attention for application in a variety of optoelectronic devices, especially in the emerging photovoltaic devices. In recent years, remarkable progress has been achieved in the device performance and stability. The optoelectronic properties of metal halide perovskites can be further tuned by ion doping. Herein, a comprehensive review of the incorporation of alkali metal ions (Li‚Å∫, Na‚Å∫, K‚Å∫ and Rb‚Å∫) in emerging perovskite solar cells for a longer carrier lifetime, lower interfacial defect density, faster charge transfer, no hysteresis, higher stability and higher power conversion efficiency is presented. The detailed mechanism behind these beneficial effects has been discussed in terms of electronic properties, film morphology, energy level alignment, carrier recombination dynamics and stability. On the basis of these latest advances and breakthroughs in alkali ion doped perovskite thin films, future research directions and prospects are also discussed, which include further understanding of the underlying photophysical mechanism and extension to other optoelectronic devices where a longer carrier lifetime and lower trap density are needed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenergy 3afilms (materials) 3ahysteresis 3alithium 3ametal ions 3apotassium 3arubidium 3asodium 3asolar cells1 aWang, Aili1 aXie, Lisha1 aDeng, Xiaoyu1 aLiao, Kejun1 aYang, Jin-an1 aLi, Tingshuai1 aHao, Feng0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2019 Oct. 29, v. 7, no. 42 p.24150-24163dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c9ta08130e3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03259naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002000140245017900160300001600339520178000355592002802135650003102163650001602194650002402210650000902234650000902243650001202252650001302264650001502277650001902292650001102311650001002322650001402332650001002346650001402356650001202370650001902382650001302401650001702414650002302431653001302454653002302467653002002490700003602510773013602546856007402682852000902756655001202765IND60694852520221119062312.0200514e20200220xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069485252DNAL7 a10.1093/ee/nvaa0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrenner, Robert10aInfluence of a Neonicotinoid Seed Treatment on a Nontarget Herbivore of Soybean (Twospotted Spider Mite) and Diet Switching by a Co-occurring Omnivore (Western Flower Thrips)  ap. 461-472.  aInsecticidal neonicotinoid seed treatments are a common agricultural insect pest management strategy; however, effects on nontarget pests and omnivorous arthropods are understudied. We used a series of experiments to evaluate impacts of the neonicotinoid seed treatment thiamethoxam on densities of herbivorous twospotted spider mites (Tetranychus urticae Koch [Acari:Tetranychidae]) and feeding behavior of western flower thrips (Frankliniella occidentalis Pergande [Thysanoptera: Thripidae]), an omnivore that feeds on spider mite eggs but is also a significant plant pest. Spider mite densities were higher on neonicotinoid-treated soybeans, but only when mites were not spatially confined.We then examined how availability of thiamethoxam-treated food items (i.e., eggs from spider mites reared on treated soybeans, soybean leaf discs, or a combination of the two), and previous exposure to thiamethoxam-treated soybean impacted thrips feeding. Regardless of the presence of leaf tissue, thrips consumed fewer spider mite eggs laid by females reared on treated soybeans, suggesting spider mite eggs can serve as poisoned prey. Overall, thrips consumed less treated soybean leaf tissue, and thrips on treated leaf discs had a lower percentage of herbivorous feeding events and consumed more nontreated spider mite eggs, indicating a dietary shift from herbivory to predation. The neonicotinoid status of spider mite eggs and prior exposure of thrips also caused shifts in the number and size of leaf scars, likely as a result of altered foraging behavior and/or movement. Shifts between herbivory and predation have implications for thrips damage, virus transmission, and pest management, especially in systems with mixtures of nontreated and neonicotinoid-treated plants.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFrankliniella occidentalis 3aGlycine max 3aTetranychus urticae 3adiet 3aeggs 3afemales 3aforaging 3aherbivores 3ainsect control 3aleaves 3amites 3aomnivores 3apests 3apredation 3arearing 3aseed treatment 3asoybeans 3athiamethoxam 3avirus transmission 0aomnivory 0afeeding preference 0apest management1 aPrischmann-Voldseth, Deirdre A.0 tEnvironmental entomology.g2020 Feb. 20, v. 49, no. 2 p.461-472dEntomological Society of AmericawJournal:jnl3243x0046-225X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ee/nvaa0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02528naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001900164245012800183300001200311520132100323592002801644650001201672650001901684650001001703650001201713650001101725650001601736650002601752650001501778650001201793650001201805650002401817650002001841650001601861650001101877651001201888651001201900773010401912852000902016856008102025655001202106IND4413213020221118043000.0160903e200812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441321302DNAL7 a190308802pmid7 a10.1007/s00436-008-1099-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJacob, Daniela10aShort communication on regional climate change scenarios and their possible use for impact studies on vector-borne diseases  ap. 3-6.  aAtmospheric observations demonstrate that, during the last decades, the climate has changed. As reported by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC, 2001, 2007), a mean increase of temperature by 0.09¬†K per decade was observed globally from 1951 to 1989. Up to now, 2008, this trend has continued. Europe experienced an extraordinary heat wave in summer 2003, with daily mean temperatures being about 10¬∞ warmer than the long-term mean. The increase of temperature varies depending on the region and season. It seems to be accompanied by changes in several hydro-meteorological quantities, like number and duration of heat waves, frost periods, storminess, or precipitation. In some regions of Germany, for example, winter precipitation has increased by more than 30% within the last four decades. In addition, very intense precipitation was observed in summer 2002 in parts of the Elbe drainage basin, which faced a severe flooding. The quantification of these changes and their possible impacts on health is a very important topic, for which regional climate change scenarios provide useful information. The analyses of possible climate change focusing on hydro-meteorological quantities, which have a major influence on vectors and rodent reservoirs will be an ongoing challenge for future research.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3afrost 3arodents 3asummer 3atemperature 3avector-borne diseases 3awatersheds 2aAnimals 2aClimate 2aComputer Simulation 2aDisease Vectors 2aForecasting 2aHumans 3aGermany 0aGermany0 tParasitology research.g2008 Dec., v. 103, no.

This investigation focused on the possible use of such waste as an energy source in the form of biogas produced via anaerobic digestion (AD). The impact of single and mixed substrates on methane production under controlled batch and continuous experimental setups was considered. The study was extended to investigate the effect of substrate size and the impact of an intermediate ozonation process on enhancing the production of biogas from single and mixed substrates. Cumulative methane production (CMP), ultimate methane yield (UMY), methane production potential (MPP), methane production rate (MPR), and maximum methane production rate (MPRmax) were used as performance indicators of the effectiveness of the anaerobic digestion process. CMP and MPP from mixed substrates were found to be higher than values obtained from a single substrate feeds, which may be attributed to a more balanced nutrient and organic matter found in mixed substrates. The large surface area of fine substrate influenced MPR and MPRmax values in the first 30 days of digestion. In later AD stages, the effect of substrate size was negligible. The MPRmax for fine substrates was 12.3¬†¬±¬†0.3 LkgVS‚Åª¬π compared to 8.8¬†¬±¬†0.2 LkgVS‚Åª¬π obtained for coarse substrate. Continuous AD with organic loading rate (OLR) of 4 kgVSm‚Åª¬πd‚Åª¬π showed a %ADefficiency of 62%, an average specific methane production in the range of 98‚Äì230 LkgVS‚Åª¬π and a volumetric methane production rate in the range of 1.94‚Äì2.35¬†m¬≥¬†m‚Åª¬≥d‚Åª¬π. Increasing the OLR increased the accumulation of volatile fatty acids in the system and resulted in decreased methane production. Two-stage AD with an intermediate ozonation process showed a significant increase in CMP and %ADefficiency compared with single-stage AD. The %ADefficiency for two-stage AD ranged from 63% to 83%, and for single-stage AD, it was in the range of 42.2%‚Äì64.3%. Anaerobic digestion of mixed agricultural waste improved the filtration, dewaterability, and settling ability of the final substrate, making it suitable for use as a soil fertilizer.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanaerobic digestion 3aanimal manures 3aanimals 3abiogas 3acontinuous systems 3adeveloping countries 3aenergy 3afeces 3afeeds 3afertilizers 3afiltration 3amethane production 3aorganic matter 3aozonation 3asoil 3asurface area 3avolatile fatty acids 0aAgricultural waste 0aInhibition 0aDung 0aMethane yield 0aSludge characteristics 0aOzonation1 aShawaqfah, M.1 aBhosale, R.R.1 aKumar, A.1 aKhraisheh, M.A.M.0 tInternational biodeterioration & biodegradation.g2017 Apr., v. 119 p.176-187dElsevier LtdwJournal:12418x0964-83057nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ibiod.2016.11.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02290naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100002200138245011800160300001800278520101000296592002801306650001901334650002901353650001101382650001301393650002301406650001601429650001601445650001401461650000901475650001801484650001301502700002201515700001801537700001701555700002301572700002001595700002801615700002301643773010901666856007201775852000901847655001201856IND60403260120221119114011.0150831e201509  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6040326012DNAL7 a10.1002/etc.30222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aO'Reilly, Kirk T.10aIdentification of ester metabolites from petroleum hydrocarbon biodegradation in groundwater using GC√óGC‚ÄêTOFMS  ap. 1959-1961.  aIn an effort to understand the nature and toxicity of petroleum hydrocarbon degradation metabolites, 2‚Äêdimensional gas chromatography linked to a time‚Äêof‚Äêflight mass spectrometer (GC√óGC‚ÄêTOFMS) was used to conduct nontargeted analysis of the extracts of 61 groundwater samples collected from 10 fuel release sites. An unexpected result was the tentative identification of 197 unique esters. Although esters are known to be part of specific hydrocarbon degradative pathways, they are not commonly considered or evaluated in field studies of petroleum biodegradation. In addition to describing the compounds identified, the present study discusses the role for nontargeted analysis in environmental studies. Overall, the low toxicological profile of the identified esters, along with the limited potential for exposure, renders them unlikely to pose any significant health risk.

Cows were fed three diets control (basal ration; C), propanol (C plus 50g propanol/kg DM; P), and propylacetate (C plus 50g propanol/kg DM and 15g propylacetate/kg DM; PPA) in a 3√É¬ó3 Latin square design with 14d period. Daily rations were fed in three equally sized portions at 8 hour intervals and 8 hourly sets of ruminal fluid, arterial, hepatic portal vein, and hepatic vein samples were collected at day 14 of each period. Milk fat yield decreased for P and PPA compared with C, however, dry matter intake and milk yield were not affected by treatment. Portal uptake of propanol accounted for 48 to 61% of ingested propanol and differed among all 3 treatments C√¢¬â¬™PPA<P. A number of metabolic variables responded to P and PPA treatments including decreased proportion of ruminal acetate to total VFA; increased proportions of ruminal propionate, isovalerate, valerate, and caproate; increased arterial glucose concentration; decreased arterial BHBA and acetate concentrations; increased net portal flux of propanol; increased net hepatic flux of glucose; and increased propanol, isopropanol, and caproate uptake by the liver. Contrary to our hypothesis that propylacetate supplementation would exacerbate the metabolic effects of propanol, we observed for a number of variables that treatment differences between C and P were partly reversed in PPA. This applied to ruminal propanol and propylacetate; arterial concentrations of ethanol, propanol, isopropanol, and isobutyrate; net portal flux of ethanol, propanol, and isopropanol; net hepatic flux of BHBA, propanol, isopropanol, and isobutyrate; net splanchnic flux of propionate; hepatic extraction of ethanol and portal recovery of dietary ethanol. The overall metabolic effect of feeding large doses of propanol was a glucogenic response presumably driven by hepatic metabolism of propanol to propionate and the increased glucogenic status was followed by a decreased milk fat yield. Inclusion of propylacetate in the diet apparently activated increased metabolism of propanol in either the rumen or ruminal epithelium and reduced the metabolic impact of the combined presence of propanol and propylacetate.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHolstein 3aacetates 3acows 3adry matter intake 3aethanol 3aglucose 3aisopropyl alcohol 3alactation 3aliver 3ametabolism 3amilk consumption 3amilk fat yield 3aportal vein 3arumen epithelium1 aKristensen, N.B.0 tLivestock science.g2012 Mar., v. 144, no. 1-2 p.37-47dElsevier B.V.x1871-14137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.livsci.2011.10.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02720naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001400149245010300163300001600266520128100282592002801563650001501591650002201606650002001628650001201648650002101660650001201681650002101693650001401714650001001728650001901738650001801757650001401775650002201789650002101811650002201832650002101854653001901875653001201894653002101906653001201927653002001939700001601959700001801975700001701993773011202010856008302122852000902205655001202214IND60087474320221119205134.0161023e201303  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008747432DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ibiod.2012.12.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Guoqi10aDecay resistance and thermal stability of bamboo preservatives prepared using camphor leaf extract  ap. 103-107.  aBecause bamboo is attacked by many fungi, bamboo products should be protected with environmentally friendly plant-based preservatives. In this study, a camphor (Cinnamomum camphor (L.) Presl) leaf extract was mixed with a melamine-modified urea formaldehyde (MUF) resin prepolymer (10% extractive¬†+¬†10% MUF), and the resulting preservative compound (CEMUF) was collected. Bamboo was treated with CEMUF, camphor leaf extract (CE, 10% extractive), and distilled water, respectively. The decay resistance of treated bamboo and the heat resistance of CE, CEMUF, and MUF were investigated by thermogravimetry. The dynamic parameters of samples at each reaction stage were calculated using the pyrolysis dynamic equation to obtain the activation energy E. The results revealed that abundant microspheres were present in the parenchyma cells around the vascular bundles of bamboo after treatment with CEMUF and that this benefitted the controlled release of the active composition. Compared to the control group, the bamboo treated with CE exhibited some decay resistance, and bamboo treated with CEMUF exhibited strong decay resistance. The order of heat resistance was as follows: MUF¬†>¬†CEMUF¬†>>¬†CE. These results demonstrate the usefulness of CEMUF as a bamboo preservative.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCinnamomum 3aactivation energy 3abamboo products 3abamboos 3abiopreservatives 3acamphor 3adecay resistance 3aequations 3afungi 3aheat tolerance 3aleaf extracts 3apyrolysis 3athermal stability 3athermogravimetry 3aurea formaldehyde 3avascular bundles 0aCamphor leaves 0aComplex 0aDecay resistance 0aExtract 0aHeat resistance1 aWang, Lihai1 aLiu, Junliang1 aHu, Shenghui0 tInternational Biodeterioration & Biodegradation.g2013 Mar., v. 78 p.103-107dElsevier Ltdx0964-83057nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ibiod.2012.12.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03282naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001600139245011800155300001600273520198400289592002802273650002002301650001302321650002102334650002102355650002002376650001302396650001402409650001602423653002202439653001502461653001502476653002002491653001002511653001302521700001702534700001902551700001902570700001902589700001802608773012802626856007302754852000902827655001202836IND60530495020221120021931.0160721e20130603xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053049502DNAL7 a10.1021/sc400040b2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhong, Yong10aRheologically Determined Critical Shear Rates for Shear-Induced Nucleation Rate Enhancements of Poly(lactic acid)  ap. 663-672.  aBoth the nonisothermal and isothermal crystallization kinetics under the influences of different shear conditions for poly(lactic acid) (PLA) were investigated by rheometry. The nucleation and growth of PLA spherulites during isothermal crystallization with different shear conditions were observed by polarized optical microscopy (POM). Shear-induced nucleation rate enhancements of PLA were studied on the basis of the prerequisite determination of the critical shear rates, for which the stretch of the longest chains (high molecular mass tails) of PLA would be expected. The transitions between different shear flow regimes for shear-induced crystallization of PLA at the temperature of 135 ¬∞C were determined by two characteristic Weissenberg numbers on the basis of reptation time and Rouse time for the high molecular mass tails, which were determined through combination of the discrete Maxwell relaxation time spectra of PLA at the reference temperature of 190 ¬∞C and the Arrhenius type of temperature dependence for the horizontal shift factor, aT. It was then found that the crystallization process of PLA was greatly enhanced by shear compared to the quiescent condition, and the crystallization kinetics could be accelerated by the increased shear rate and/or shear time. It was more interesting to find that there existed a critical shear time under a certain shear rate, and a further increase in the shear time did not lead to further acceleration of the crystallization kinetics. POM observation indicated that the acceleration of crystallization kinetics was obviously brought about by the enhanced nucleus density under the application of shear and the subsequent spherulitic growth rates kept about constant. Thus, a kinetic model based on directly relating the extra number of activated nuclei promoted by shear to the shear rate was further applied to well predict the effects of shear time on the shear-induced isothermal crystallization kinetics of PLA.  aPublisher supplied data 3acrystallization 3akinetics 3alight microscopy 3amolecular weight 3apolylactic acid 3arheology 3arheometry 3atemperature 0aPoly(lactic acid) 0aNucleation 0aSpherulite 0aCrystallization 0aShear 0aRheology1 aFang, Huagao1 aZhang, Yaqiong1 aWang, Zhongkai1 aYang, Jingjing1 aWang, Zhigang0 tACS sustainable chemistry .g2013 June 03, v. 1, no. 6 p.663-672dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23317x2168-04857nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/sc400040b3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03106naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001500150245010200165300001600267520150200283592002801785650002001813650002501833650001601858650001601874650002101890650001901911650001601930650002501946650003101971650001802002650001002020650002102030650001902051650001102070650001102081650001902092650002402111650002902135650001602164653001602180653002002196653003002216653002302246700001502269700001602284700002002300700001402320700001702334773010702351856008502458852000902543655001202552IND60629572620221117042000.0211003e201903  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062957262DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envpol.2018.12.0842doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuang, Wei10aBisphenol S induced epigenetic and transcriptional changes in human breast cancer cell line MCF-7  ap. 697-703.  aIn recent years, concerns about using Bisphenol A (BPA) in daily consume products and its effects in many chronic human diseases have prompted the removal of BPA. However, the widely used BPA alternatives, including Bisphenol S (BPS), have a high structural similarity with BPA, suggesting that they may have similar biological effects towards human beings. Indeed, BPS was also found to have endocrine-disrupting effects. Epigenetic mechanism was reported to be involved in BPA-induced biological effects in both in¬†vitro and in¬†vivo models. However, there is no assessment on whether BPS could cause epigenetic changes. In this work, we investigated the possible epigenetic effects of BPS that might induce in human breast cancer cell line MCF-7. We found that BPS could change DNA methylation level of transposons. Besides, methylation status in promoter of breast cancer related genes CDH1, SFN, TNFRSF10C were also changed, which implied that BPS might play a role in the development of breast cancer. Gene expression profiling showed that some genes related to breast cancer progression were upregulated, including THBS4, PPARGC1A, CREB5, COL5A3. Gene ontology (GO) analysis of the differentially expressed genes revealed the significantly changes in PI3K-Akt signaling pathway and extracellular matrix, which were related to the proliferation, migration and invasion of breast cancer cells. These results illustrated that BPS exposure might play roles in the progression of breast cancer.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA methylation 3abioactive properties 3abisphenol A 3abisphenol S 3abreast neoplasms 3adisease course 3aepigenetics 3aextracellular matrix 3agene expression regulation 3agene ontology 3agenes 3ahuman cell lines 3ahuman diseases 3ahumans 3amodels 3aneoplasm cells 3asignal transduction 3atranscription (genetics) 3atransposons 0aBisphenol S 0aDNA methylation 0aGene expression profiling 0aBreast cancer cell1 aZhao, Chao1 aZhong, Huan1 aZhang, Shoudong1 aXia, Yiji1 aCai, Zongwei0 tEnvironmental pollution.g2019 Mar., v. 246 p.697-703dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl41014x0269-74917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2018.12.0843Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02901naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245010200159300002000261520149900281592002801780650001301808650001101821650001301832650001301845650002101858650002201879650001601901650001401917650001501931650001101946650000901957650002101966700001901987700001202006700001902018700001602037700002002053700002202073700001602095700001502111700001802126700001802144700001802162773014402180856007402324852000902398655001202407IND60674772820221119215629.0191030e20191029xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067477282DNAL7 a10.1039/c9ta08299a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDong, Tiantian12aA well-designed water-soluble binder enlightening the 5 V-class LiNi‚ÇÄ.‚ÇÖMn‚ÇÅ.‚ÇÖO‚ÇÑ cathodes  ap. 24594-24601.  aSpinel LiNi‚ÇÄ.‚ÇÖMn‚ÇÅ.‚ÇÖO‚ÇÑ (LNMO) is one of the most promising cathode materials for high-energy density lithium batteries owing to its high reversible capacity and high operating voltage. However, LNMO-based lithium batteries have poor cycling performance due to the decomposition of liquid electrolytes and dissolution of transition metal (e.g. Mn and Ni) ions at high operating voltages. Herein, poly(methyl vinyl ether-alt-lithium maleic acid) (P(MVE-LMA)) is presented as an excellent aqueous binder for the first time to tackle the abovementioned issues, in which the lithium carboxylic motifs of P(MVE-LMA) deliver superior adhesion and cohesion capabilities and interact with transition metal cations to inhibit their dissolution from cathodes, whereas its ether motifs can adsorb on the carbon particle surface to render excellent distribution of carbon black. As a result, a 5 V-class LNMO/Li battery fabricated employing the P(MVE-LMA) binder exhibited better electrochemical performance (e.g., cycling life, cell impedance and rate capability) when compared with the battery with the traditional polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) binder. A more thorough investigation clearly elucidated that the enhanced battery performance of the P(MVE-LMA) binder could be attributed to the generation of a favorable cathode electrolyte interphase (CEI) layer, in turn favorably suppressing the oxidative decomposition of electrolytes and stabilizing the lattice structure of LNMO upon cycling.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadhesion 3acarbon 3acathodes 3acohesion 3aelectrochemistry 3alithium batteries 3amaleic acid 3amanganese 3ametal ions 3anickel 3asoot 3awater solubility1 aZhang, Huanrui1 aMa, Yue1 aZhang, Jianjun1 aDu, Xiaofan1 aL√º, Chenglong,1 aShangguan, Xuehui1 aLi, Jiedong1 aZhang, Min1 aYang, Jinfeng1 aZhou, Xinhong1 aCui, Guanglei0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2019 Oct. 29, v. 7, no. 42 p.24594-24601dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c9ta08299a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02501naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002500150245010900175300001600284520143000300592002801730650002501758650002301783650002601806650002201832650001101854700001801865700001801883700002001901700001901921700002001940773011001960856008402070852000902154655001202163IND60634220220221120063914.0190321e201806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063422022DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envsci.2017.11.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHansen, Ulrich Elmer10aSustainability transitions in developing countries: Stocktaking, new contributions and a research agenda  ap. 198-203.  aAn increasing number of studies have analysed the scope for, and the barriers to, transitions toward sustainability in the context of developing countries building on analytical perspectives from the sustainability transitions literature. This paper introduces a special issue on sustainability transitions in developing countries, which takes stock of this emerging field of research and presents new empirical research that contributes to further advancement of our understanding of the conditions in which sustainability transitions are likely to take place in developing countries and what is involved in these transformative processes. This introductory paper presents the five papers contained in the special issue. The first paper comprises a review of the existing literature on the subject, and the other four papers present new empirical research. The key findings of the papers are discussed in relation to previous research in the field specifically related to four crosscutting themes: (i) global-local linkages and external dependencies; (ii) stability and non-stability of regimes; (iii) undemocratic and non-egalitarian nature of regimes; and (iv) nurturing the development of niches versus the execution of individual projects. The introductory paper concludes by presenting a research agenda, which aims to provide promising avenues for future research on sustainability transitions in developing countries.  aPublisher supplied data 3adeveloping countries 3aempirical research 3aenvironmental science 3aissues and policy 3aniches1 aNygaard, Ivan1 aRomijn, Henny1 aWieczorek, Anna1 aKamp, Linda M.1 aKlerkx, Laurens0 tEnvironmental science & policy.g2018 June, v. 84 p.198-203dElsevier LtdwJournal:12413x1462-90117nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envsci.2017.11.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04391naa a2200781 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245009900172506011700271506007600388520198800464592002802452506003702480650000802517650005202525650001502577650002402592650001502616650001102631650001102642650001502653650001202668650001502680650002502695651001102720653004002731653006502771653004902836653002602885653001602911653002302927653000902950653000802959653000802967653000902975653000802984653001002992653000803002653000803010653000703018653000803025653001003033653000803043653000903051700002303060700001603083700002003099700002403119700002303143700002003166700002103186700002403207700002403231700001903255700003403274700002303308700001903331700001603350710003203366773010503398856008503503852000903588655001203597IND60758367120221207110312.0220719e202201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075836712DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envint.2021.1069982doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCluzel, Nicolas.,12aA nationwide indicator to smooth and normalize heterogeneous SARS-CoV-2 RNA data in wastewater  aCreative Commons Attribution¬†4.0¬†Generic (CC BY-NC-ND¬†4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aSince many infected people experience no or few symptoms, the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic is frequently monitored through massive virus testing of the population, an approach that may be biased and may be difficult to sustain in low-income countries. Since SARS-CoV-2 RNA can be detected in stool samples, quantifying SARS-CoV-2 genome by RT-qPCR in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) has been carried out as a complementary tool to monitor virus circulation among human populations. However, measuring SARS-CoV-2 viral load in WWTPs can be affected by many experimental and environmental factors. To circumvent these limits, we propose here a novel indicator, the wastewater indicator (WWI), that partly reduces and corrects the noise associated with the SARS-CoV-2 genome quantification in wastewater (average noise reduction of 19%). All data processing results in an average correlation gain of 18% with the incidence rate. The WWI can take into account the censorship linked to the limit of quantification (LOQ), allows the automatic detection of outliers to be integrated into the smoothing algorithm, estimates the average measurement error committed on the samples and proposes a solution for inter-laboratory normalization in the absence of inter-laboratory assays (ILA). This method has been successfully applied in the context of Ob√©pine, a French national network that has been quantifying SARS-CoV-2 genome in a representative sample of French WWTPs since March 5th 2020. By August 26th, 2021, 168 WWTPs were monitored in the French metropolitan and overseas territories of France. We detail the process of elaboration of this indicator, show that it is strongly correlated to the incidence rate and that the optimal time lag between these two signals is only a few days, making our indicator an efficient complement to the incidence rate. This alternative approach may be especially important to evaluate SARS-CoV-2 dynamics in human populations when the testing rate is low.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aRNA 3aSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 3aalgorithms 3aautomatic detection 3acomplement 3agenome 3ahumans 3aviral load 3aviruses 3awastewater 3awastewater treatment 3aFrance 0aWastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) 0aSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) 0aCoronavirus infectious disease 19 (COVID-19) 0aMathematical modeling 0aCorrelation 0aSampling frequency 0aWWTP 0aWWI 0aLOQ 0aEPCI 0aCOD 0aEDQPI 0aILA 0aBIC 0aCM 0aLSM 0aCMILA 0aRMS 0aRMSE1 aCourbariaux, Marie1 aWang, Siyun1 aMoulin, Laurent1 aWurtzer, S√©bastien1 aBertrand, Isabelle1 aLaurent, Karine1 aMonfort, Patrick1 aGantzer, Christophe1 aGuyader, Soizick Le1 aBoni, Micka√´l1 aMouchel, J.-M.q(Jean-Marie),1 aMar√©chal, Vincent1 aNuel, Gr√©gory1 aMaday, Yvon2 aOb√©pine consortiumeauthor0 tEnvironment international.g2022 Jan., v. 158 p.106998-dElsevier LtdwJournal:6374x0160-41207nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envint.2021.1069983Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03105naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002500140245017300165300001600338520172200354592002802076650002402104650001702128650001302145650001602158650001102174650002402185650001902209650001402228650001402242650002102256650002102277650001102298650001002309650001502319651001302334653002402347653001702371653002502388700002702413773013602440856007402576852000902650655001202659IND60694852820221119062204.0200514e20200228xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069485282DNAL7 a10.1093/ee/nvaa0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEngelken, Patrick J.10aSpecies Diversity and Assemblages of Cerambycidae in the Aftermath of the Emerald Ash Borer (Coleoptera: Buptrestidae) Invasion in Riparian Forests of Southern Michigan  ap. 391-404.  aExtensive ash (Fraxinus spp.) mortality has been reported across much of the area in eastern North America invaded by emerald ash borer (Agrilus planipennis Fairmaire), but indirect effects of emerald ash borer invasion on native forest insects are not well-studied. We assessed cerambycid beetle (Coleoptera: Cerambycidae) species captured in baited cross-vane panel traps during the 2017 and 2018 growing seasons.Traps were placed in 12 riparian forest sites distributed across three watersheds selected to represent the temporal gradient of the emerald ash borer invasion from southeastern to southwestern Michigan. Although ash species originally dominated overstory vegetation in all sites, >85% of ash basal area has been killed by emerald ash borer. We captured a total of 3,645 beetles representing 65 species and five subfamilies. Species assemblages in southeast sites, with the longest history of emerald ash borer invasion, differed from those in south central and southwest Michigan, which were similar. These differences were largely due to three species, which accounted for >60% of beetle captures in southeast Michigan. Associations among site-related variables and beetle captures indicated cerambycid species assemblages were associated most strongly with abundance and decay stage of coarse woody debris. During both years, >90% of cerambycid species were captured by mid-summer but seasonal activity differed among and within tribes. Numbers of beetles captured by canopy and ground traps were similar but species richness was higher in canopy traps than ground traps.

Nevertheless, contaminants like mycotoxins, antibiotics, and microplastics (MPs) could be introduced and negatively affect the AD system. Over 180 literatures involved the occurrence, influence and removal strategies of these three types of pollutants in AD were summarized in this review. Aflatoxin B1(AFB1) as the most concerned mycotoxins were poorly degraded and brought about inhibitions in short-term. Considering methanogenesis inhibition and occurrence concentration, the risk of oxytetracycline and norfloxacin were identified as priority among antibiotics. Leaching toxic additives from MPs could be responsible for the AD inhibition, while their materials and sizes could also prolong the acidification and methanation processes in FWAD. Strategies of bioaugmentation technologies and bioreactors to enhance the removal were suggested. Perspectives were provided for a better understanding of the fates of reviewed contaminants and their elimination in FWAD systems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacidification 3aaflatoxin B1 3aagricultural wastes 3aanaerobic digestion 3abioaugmentation 3abioreactors 3abiosolids 3afood waste 3amethane production 3amicroplastics 3anorfloxacin 3aoxytetracycline 3arisk 3asewage sludge 3atoxicity 0aOrganic waste 0aEmerging contaminants 0aBiotreatment 0aResource utilization 0aCo-digestion1 aWu, Dong1 aSu, Yinglong1 aXie, Bing0 tBioresource technology.g2021 June, v. 330 p.124987-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46263x0960-85247nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2021.1249873Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02218naa a2200241 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245011600164300001600280520143200296592002801728650002301756650001501779651000901794773010401803856004801907852000901955655001201964IND50068961320221117183545.0130901e201309  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006896132DNAL7 a10.1007/s12665-012-2181-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKlime≈°, Jan10aLandslide temporal analysis and susceptibility assessment as bases for landslide mitigation, Machu Picchu, Peru  ap. 913-925.  aMulti-temporal landslide occurrence information acquired through aerial photo interpretation and field mapping was used to assess occurrence frequencies on the slopes around the UNESCO cultural world heritage site of Machu Picchu, Peru. This showed that the coarse time resolution of the historical landslide information may lead to inaccurate interpretations regarding landslide occurrence frequencies in some parts of the study area. In addition, the assumption that the past landslide frequency can be used to describe the future landslide occurrence was not proved in the study area. Thereafter, unique conditional analyses were undertaken to assess landslide susceptibility using a limited number of preparatory factor maps. It showed that large majority of the Inca City is located on least susceptible areas within the region. The results of the susceptibility assessment combined with landslide occurrence frequencies may serve as a basis for the landslide hazard mitigation in the studied area. For these purposes, pixel-based susceptibility maps were generalized into expert-defined landslide management units. These units provide site managers with easily understandable and applicable hence reliable information about future landslide occurrences. An approach describing usage of the resulting susceptibility maps for onsite mitigation purposes was described with respect to the needs of Machu Picchu site managers.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaerial photography 3alandslides 3aPeru0 tEnvironmental earth sciences.g2013 Sept., v. 70, no. 2 p.913-925dSpringer-Verlagx1866-62807nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12665-012-2181-2  aDNAL 7aarticle03437naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245011900168300001800287520166400305592002801969650001601997650002502013650001602038650001602054650001902070650002402089650002002113650003502133650002902168650001602197650002302213650002402236650001402260650001902274650001402293650003002307650001302337650001902350650001902369650001402388650004302402650001302445653001602458653002902474653001902503653002402522700002702546700003102573700006402604773010902668856008502777852000902862655001202871IND60629572920221117043112.0211003e201903  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062957292DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envpol.2019.01.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLomb√≥, Marta10aCardiogenesis impairment promoted by bisphenol A exposure is successfully counteracted by epigallocatechin gallate  ap. 1008-1019.  aExposure to the emerging contaminant bisphenol A (BPA) is ubiquitous and associated with cardiovascular disorders. BPA effect as endocrine disruptor is widely known but other mechanisms underlying heart disease, such as epigenetic modifications, remain still unclear. A compound of green tea, epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), may act both as anti-estrogen and as inhibitor of some epigenetic enzymes. The aims of this study were to analyze the molecular processes related to BPA impairment of heart development and to prove the potential ability of EGCG to neutralize the toxic effects caused by BPA on cardiac health. Zebrafish embryos were exposed to 2000 and 4000‚ÄØŒºg/L BPA and treated with 50 and 100‚ÄØŒºM EGCG. Heart malformations were assessed at histological level and by confocal imaging. Expression of genes involved in cardiac development, estrogen receptors and epigenetic enzymes was analyzed by qPCR whereas epigenetic modifications were evaluated by whole mount immunostaining. BPA embryonic exposure led to changes in cardiac phenotype, induced an overexpression of hand2, a crucial factor for cardiomyocyte differentiation, increased the expression of estrogen receptor (esr2b), promoted an overexpression of a histone acetyltransferase (kat6a) and also caused an increase in histone acetylation, both mechanisms being able to act in sinergy. EGCG treatment neutralized all the molecular alterations caused by BPA, allowing the embryos to go on with a proper heart development. Both molecular mechanisms of BPA action (estrogenic and epigenetic) likely lying behind cardiogenesis impairment were successfully counteracted by EGCG treatment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDanio rerio 3aabnormal development 3aacetylation 3abisphenol A 3acardiomyocytes 3aconfocal microscopy 3aembryo (animal) 3aendocrine-disrupting chemicals 3aepigallocatechin gallate 3aepigenetics 3aestrogen receptors 3agene overexpression 3agreen tea 3aheart diseases 3ahistology 3ahistone acetyltransferase 3ahistones 3aimage analysis 3aneutralization 3aphenotype 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3atoxicity 0aBisphenol A 0aEpigallocatechin Gallate 0aCardiotoxicity 0aHistone acetylation1 aGonz√°lez-Rojo, Silvia1 aFern√°ndez-D√≠ez, Cristina1 aHerr√°ez, Mar√≠a Paz1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0028-36160 tEnvironmental pollution.g2019 Mar., v. 246 p.1008-1019dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl41014x0269-74917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2019.01.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03011naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002800140245015300168300002000321520135200341592002801693650003701721650001101758650002201769650001101791650002101802650002301823650001401846650002101860650000901881650001301890650000901903650001301912650001801925650001401943650003101957650001301988650002202001650002002023650002302043700003802066700002102104700001902125700002502144700002802169700003002197700002702227773014402254856007402398852000902472655001202481IND60674773120221119220224.0191030e20191029xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067477312DNAL7 a10.1039/c9ta08424j2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMorales-Lara, Francisco10aUltra-small metal nanoparticles supported on carbon nanotubes through surface chelation and hydrogen plasma reduction for methanol electro-oxidation  ap. 24502-24514.  aThis paper reports a new method to obtain ultra-small Pd and Pt nanoparticles (0.5‚Äì1 nm) supported on multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs). Even at high loadings of both metals (22.3 and 31.5% (wt/wt) of Pd¬≤‚Å∫ and Pt¬≤‚Å∫, respectively), very narrow and unimodal particle size distributions are achieved. The complexing capabilities of polyethyleneimine covalently attached to the surface of the tubes are optimal for the retention of Pd¬≤‚Å∫ and Pt¬≤‚Å∫ from solution. We have addressed the reduction of the retained ions by two approaches: a classical treatment with NaBH‚ÇÑ in aqueous solution, and a novel method using hydrogen cold plasma to preserve the structural features of the material. Cold plasma produced degrees of reduction similar or even larger than NaBH‚ÇÑ, supporting the advantage of hydrogen cold plasma as reducing agent as it is a simple, clean and fast (15 minutes) procedure. XPS analysis of the reduced materials show an increase in the electron density near the Fermi level. Pt/MWCNT materials have been tested as anode for methanol electrooxidation, showing a catalytic profile typical of that observed for platinum nanoparticles. The stability after 1000 cycles of the plasma-reduced materials is much larger than these reported for Pt/carbon materials, indicating the stability of the ultra-small nanoparticles.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aanodes 3aaqueous solutions 3acarbon 3acarbon nanotubes 3acatalytic activity 3achelation 3achemical bonding 3acold 3ahydrogen 3aions 3amethanol 3ananoparticles 3apalladium 3aparticle size distribution 3aplatinum 3apolyethyleneimine 3areducing agents 3asodium borohydride1 aAbdelkader-Fern√°ndez, V√≠ctor K.1 aMelguizo, Manuel1 aTurco, Antonio1 aMazzotta, Elisabetta1 aDomingo-Garc√≠a, Mar√≠a1 aL√≥pez-Garz√≥n, F.

E2471-E2477.  aBeeswax and a plasticizer (ATBC) were added to polylactic acid (PLA) films in order to enhance the water vapor barrier properties of the films. Beeswax improved the barrier properties; the water vapor permeability in the composite containing 1% beeswax was 58% lower than that of the neat PLA. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and X‚Äêray diffraction analysis revealed that the incorporation of beeswax and ATBC had so little effect on the PLA structure. In addition, the structure of PLA did not vary substantially with the additions. The surfaces of the composites were examined by using field emission scanning electron microscopy. Differential scanning calorimetry results showed that the degree of crystallinity of the PLA films increased with the addition of beeswax and ATBC. However, the tensile strength and elongation at break of the composites containing beeswax were up to approximately 50% lower than those of the neat PLA. Although further study is needed to improve the mechanical properties, the aforementioned results showed that the PLA barrier properties can be improved by the incorporation of a small amount of beeswax and ATBC.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3abeeswax 3acrystal structure 3adifferential scanning calorimetry 3apermeability 3aplasticizers 3apolylactic acid 3ascanning electron microscopy 3atensile strength 3awater vapor1 aKim, Jeong Ae1 aKo, Jung A1 aPark, Hyun-Jin,0 tJournal of food science.g2015 Nov., v. 80, no. 11 p.E2471-E2477dThe Institutex0022-11477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1750-3841.130813Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03554naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094024002800125040001800153100002100171245016500192300001600357506007600373506003100449520164900480592002802129596006602157596008302223596004502306506003702351650002102388650002502409650001502434650001402449650002302463650002302486650001302509650001302522650001202535650001802547650001502565650001802580650001802598650001502616650001402631650001102645651001202656653001502668653001502683700002402698700002702722700002002749773013502769856007502904852000902979655001202988IND60694853020221207064839.0200514e20200303xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069485302DNAL7 a10.1093/ee/nvaa0152chorus7 a10.1093/ee/nvaa0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRold√°n, Erik L.10aAbundance of the Sugarcane Borer (Lepidoptera: Crambidae) and Foraging Ants (Hymenoptera: Formicidae) in Sugarcane Grown on Organic and Mineral Soils in Florida  ap. 473-481.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCHORUS License Information  aA study was conducted in Florida to determine sugarcane borer, Diatraea saccharalis (F.), injury and infestation levels in sugarcane (Saccharum spp. hybrids), D. saccharalis parasitism rates, and ant foraging activity in 32 commercial fields as affected by soil type (shallow organic vs deep organic vs mineral). In 2017 and 2018, each field was sampled four times during the summer for D. saccharalis by inspecting 100 sugarcane stalks and for foraging ants using plastic tubes baited with hot dog at 12 locations. One non-parasitized D. saccharalis larva was collected in 2017 and in 2018 out of 12,100 and 12,600 stalks sampled, respectively. Additional sampling of 50 stalks per field in October showed that 0.6% (2017) and 0.1% (2018) of the sugarcane stalks had bored internodes, and one Cotesia flavipes (Cameron) (Hymenoptera: Braconidae) cocoon mass was observed. Seven ant species foraged in sugarcane fields, including the red imported fire ant, Solenopsis invicta Buren, which was the most abundant ant. Solenopsis invicta was not affected by soil type; however, sugarcane fields on shallow organic soils might represent a more suitable environment.The third most abundant foraging ant, Nylanderia bourbonica (Forel), was more abundant in mineral soil fields than in shallow and deep organic soil fields. Results suggest that D. saccharalis population levels in Florida sugarcane are extremely low under current production conditions regardless of soil type. In addition, the observation of C. flavipes, S. invicta, and six other ant species suggest that biological control contributes to these low D. saccharalis population levels.  aPublisher supplied data  cFlorida Sugar Cane Leaguedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100011863  cNational Institute of Food and Agriculturedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100005825  cUSDAdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/1000001990 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aCotesia flavipes 3aDiatraea saccharalis 3aNylanderia 3aSaccharum 3aSolenopsis invicta 3abiological control 3aforaging 3ahot dogs 3ahybrids 3ainsect larvae 3ainternodes 3amineral soils 3aorganic soils 3aparasitism 3asugarcane 3asummer 3aFlorida 0astem borer 0aparasitoid1 aBeuzelin, Julien M.1 aVanWeelden, Matthew T.1 aCherry, Ron H.,0 tEnvironmental entomology.g2020 Mar. 3, v. 49, no. 2 p.473-481dEntomological Society of AmericawJournal:jnl3243x0046-225X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ee/nvaa0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03822naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001300150245009700163506011700260506007600377520196000453592002802413506003702441650000802478650001802486650002002504650000902524650001502533650002002548650001602568650002402584650001102608650000902619650001202628651001002640653003202650653001802682653002002700653002302720700001802743700001802761700001202779700001802791700001202809700001502821700001802836700001702854700001402871700001402885700001302899700001602912700001702928700001802945700001902963700001502982773010502997856008503102852000903187655001203196IND60758367420221207110256.0220719e202201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075836742DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envint.2021.1070012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYan, Qin10aEmission and spatialized health risks for trace elements from domestic coal burning in China  aCreative Commons Attribution¬†4.0¬†Generic (CC BY-NC-ND¬†4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aResidential coal combustion (RCC) emission exhibited obvious daily variation, while no real-time estimation of air pollutants from RCC has been reported, as the shortages of corresponding activity dataset and emission factors with high time resolution. A real-time monitoring platform for RCC emission was established. Hourly emission factors of 18 typed of TEs from eleven kinds of chunk coals and nine kinds of honeycomb coals burning in China were obtained. The monthly and hourly coal consumption amounts were calculated with reference and our field survey. Then the hourly TEs emission inventories from RCC were established in China. GEOS-Chem and Risk Quotients Models were utilized to map the spatialized health risks of hazardous elements, including the gridded hazard index and carcinogenic risk. The result indicated that the EFs of TEs would be underestimated if the tests only consider flaming conditions. Cu, K, Ca, Zn, and Co were the top five elements from RCC, with corresponding emission amounts as 1397.7, 1054.0, 676.0, 623.5 and 420 tons in 2017, respectively. K, Ti, Fe, Sn, and Sb showed hourly peak values under flaming dominated periods, accounting for 48.2%, 45.9%, 31.8%, 42.8%, and 33.8% of their daily emissions. Other elements (e.g., V, Co, As, Hg and Pb) exhibited higher emissions under smoldering dominated period in nighttime, accounting for 22.2%, 32.9%, 27.6%, 34.7%, and 28.4% of their daily emissions. TEs emission from RCC closely follows the habits of human daily cooking and heating activity. The national HI were lower than the acceptable level (HI¬†‚â§¬†1) except Sichuan Province (up to 1.2). Higher carcinogenic risks (‚â•1¬†√ó¬†10‚Åª‚Å∂) occurred in parts of Sichuan, Shanxi, Hunan and Hubei, which were up to 2.0¬†√ó¬†10‚Åª‚Åµ. The high-resolution TEs emission inventories could be useful for future modeling works on the formation and evolution of air pollution and are helpful for human exposure assessment.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aair 3aair pollution 3acarcinogenicity 3acoal 3acombustion 3adata collection 3aenvironment 3aexposure assessment 3ahumans 3arisk 3asurveys 3aChina 0aResidential coal combustion 0aTrace element 0aHourly emission 0aEmission inventory1 aKong, Shaofei1 aYan, Yingying1 aLiu, Xi1 aZheng, Shurui1 aQin, Si1 aWu, Fangqi1 aNiu, Zhenzhen1 aZheng, Huang1 aCheng, Yi1 aZeng, Xin1 aWu, Jian1 aYao, Liquan1 aLiu, Dantong1 aShen, Guofeng1 aShen, Zhenxing1 aQi, Shihua0 tEnvironment international.g2022 Jan., v. 158 p.107001-dElsevier LtdwJournal:6374x0160-41207nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envint.2021.1070013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02718naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002100149245010000170300001600270520120200286592002801488650002901516650001201545650001401557650001301571650001101584650000901595650001401604650001101618650001801629650001501647650002401662653002501686653001601711653002001727653001401747653001601761700002401777700001901801700002301820700002301843700001701866700002501883700002401908700002401932700002301956773012801979856008402107852000902191655001202200IND60565852020221122223545.0180904e201704  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056585202DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ibiod.2016.12.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWatts, Mathew P.10aHighly efficient degradation of organic pollutants using a microbially-synthesized nanocatalyst  ap. 155-161.  aMagnetite is a common subsurface mineral, formed biogenically in anaerobic environments. Containing Fe(II), it is reactive towards a variety of common redox sensitive subsurface contaminants. To extend the reactivity of biomagnetite it is possible to add a coating of Pd(0) nanostructures, which is capable of sustained catalytic reactivity. Here we assess the reactivity of biogenic nano-magnetite (BnM), formed by the reduction of Fe(III) oxyhydroxide by Geobacter sulfurreducens, to the model organic compounds nitrobenzene (ArNO2) and tetrachloroethylene (PCE), and compare its performance to biomagnetite functionalized with Pd(0) (Pd-BnM). The BnM and the Pd-BnM were both found to be highly reactive towards ArNO2, quantitatively transforming it to the reduced product aniline (ArNH2). When applied to tetrachloroethylene (PCE), the BnM was found to be poorly reactive, while the Pd-BnM rapidly dechlorinated the PCE to the benign product, ethane, at rates comparable to synthetic nano-scale catalysts. The biological synthesis route proposed is highly scalable and offers a green, environmentally benign route for the production of highly reactive nanoparticles for environmental clean-up.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGeobacter sulfurreducens 3aaniline 3acatalysts 3acoatings 3aethane 3airon 3amagnetite 3amodels 3ananoparticles 3apollutants 3atetrachloroethylene 0aChlorinated solvents 0aContaminant 0aWater treatment 0aMagnetite 0aBiocatalyst1 aCutting, Richard S.1 aJoshi, Nimisha1 aCoker, Victoria S.1 aMosberger, Apalona1 aZhou, Boyuan1 aDavies, Catherine M.1 avan Dongen, Bart E.1 aHoffstetter, Thomas1 aLloyd, Jonathan R.0 tInternational biodeterioration & biodegradation.g2017 Apr., v. 119 p.155-161dElsevier LtdwJournal:12418x0964-83057nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ibiod.2016.12.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03429naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100005800146245019100204300001600395500001900411520154000430536025201970592002802222596015402250650002802404650001202432650001602444650001702460650001102477650003502488650000902523650000902532650001102541650001702552653001802569653000902587653001602596653003402612653001702646700002202663700002002685700001802705700001902723773011602742856008002858852000902938655001202947IND60707714620221118184445.0200820e202009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070771462DNAL7 a10.1177/02601060209238062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIizaka, Shinji1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5901-066310aDistance from the nearest grocery stores and frequency of store-specific shopping are associated with dietary intake frequency among the community-dwelling independent elderly population  ap. 197-207.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aLow accessibility to grocery stores may change dietary habits and increase health problems for elderly people living in communities. This study investigated whether the distance from the nearest grocery stores, including supermarkets, convenience stores, and drugstores, and the frequency of store-specific shopping were associated with dietary intake frequency among elderly people. A cross-sectional study was conducted in two towns of suburban cities. A total of 177 people aged ‚â•65 years were recruited (M ‚Çêg‚Çë=76.7 years). The frequency of intake of 10 food groups and dietary variety scores (DVS) were evaluated. Distances from the districts to the nearest grocery stores and the frequency of shopping during a week at each store were evaluated using a geographic information system. For supermarkets, people living <300 metres from the nearest supermarket showed a higher intake frequency of fruit (p=0.024) and oil/fat (p=0.045), and those shopping three or more times a week showed a higher intake frequency of meat (p=0.025). In the case of drugstores, people shopping one or more times a week showed a higher intake frequency of eggs (p=0.006) and oil/fat (p=0.048). People living <300 m from the nearest supermarkets (p=0.048) and drugstores (p=0.047) showed higher DVS than those living ‚â•500 m from the nearest supermarkets and drugstores. Our findings suggest that shopping at supermarkets and drugstores is associated with dietary intake frequency and dietary quality for elderly people living in suburban cities.  aFunding The authors disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship and/or publication of this article: This work was supported by a JSPS Grant-in-Aid for Young Scientists (B) (2017‚Äì2019, Grant Number 17K18071).  aPublisher supplied data  aGrant-in-Aid for Young Scientists (B) [2017‚Äì2019cJapan Society for the Promotion of Sciencedhttps://doi.org/https://doi.org/10.13039/501100001691 3across-sectional studies 3aelderly 3afood intake 3afood quality 3afruits 3ageographic information systems 3ameat 3aoils 3apeople 3asupermarkets 0aAccessibility 0adiet 0afood desert 0ageographic information system 0amalnutrition1 aKoitabashi, Emiko1 aNegishi, Takako1 aKawamura, Aki1 aIizuka, Yuzuru0 tNutrition and health.g2020 Sept., v. 26, no. 3 p.197-207dSAGE PublicationswJournal:jnl34213x2047-945X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/02601060209238063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03040naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245011600166506011700282506007600399520148500475592002801960506003701988650001202025650001202037650002002049650001602069650002502085650002702110650001102137650001602148650002102164653001602185653001902201653001902220653001502239653001002254700001602264700001202280700001502292700001502307700002002322700001702342773010502359856008502464852000902549655001202558IND60758367520221207110310.0220719e202201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075836752DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envint.2021.1070022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDong, Yulin10aDecrease in the residents‚Äô accessibility of summer cooling services due to green space loss in Chinese cities  aCreative Commons Attribution¬†4.0¬†Generic (CC BY-NC-ND¬†4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aUrban green spaces (UGSs) reduce the surrounding temperature and create cooling areas as a buffer between people and high temperatures, thus helping residents adapt to the warming climate. However, the accessibility of UGS cooling services to the residents of cities remains largely unknown, which hinders decision-making regarding the formulation of climate adaptation and urban greening schemes. In the present study, we estimated the number of residents who accessed UGSs for cooling by analyzing the annual changes in such cooling areas during summer across 315 Chinese cities from 2003 to 2015. Approximately 93.3% of the cities showed significant decreasing trends (p¬†<¬†0.05) of the total UGS area; as such the UGS coverage dropped from 12.23¬†¬±¬†0.32% in 2003 to 7.69¬†¬±¬†0.22% in 2015. Consequently, with the prevalent loss of UGS, the coverage of cooling spaces decreased from 32.55¬†¬±¬†0.76% in 2003 to 24.39¬†¬±¬†0.60% in 2015. This has formed a spatial mismatch between the growing urban population and the remaining UGSs. Accordingly, the number of residents of areas outside these cooling spaces increased by 4.23 million per year. In particular, the shortage of cooling services was more significant in cities with¬†<¬†20,000 USD gross domestic product per capita and¬†<¬†5 million residents than in the rest of the cities. To minimize the adverse impacts of increasing temperatures, focused greening plans are warranted, specifically in underdeveloped cities.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aclimate 3acooling 3adecision making 3aenvironment 3agreen infrastructure 3agross domestic product 3asummer 3atemperature 3aurban population 0aGreen space 0aCooling effect 0aRemote sensing 0aUrban heat 0aChina1 aRen, Zhibin1 aFu, Yao1 aHu, Nanlin1 aGuo, Yujie1 aJia, Guangliang1 aHe, Xingyuan0 tEnvironment international.g2022 Jan., v. 158 p.107002-dElsevier LtdwJournal:6374x0160-41207nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envint.2021.1070023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02533naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001800144245002500162300002000187500001900207520132200226592002801548650001301576650001501589650002301604650001301627650001401640653003201654653001801686653002101704700001401725700001601739700005101755700005401806700005801860773014201918856007802060852000902138655001202147IND60718700020221119045714.0201125e20201111xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071870002DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.0c140072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Hengjia10aNoble Metal Aerogels  ap. 52234-52250.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aNoble metal-based nanomaterials have been a hot research topic during the past few decades. Particularly, self-assembled porous architectures have triggered tremendous interest. At the forefront of porous nanostructures, there exists a research endeavor of noble metal aerogels (NMAs), which are unique in terms of macroscopic assembly systems and three-dimensional (3D) porous network nanostructures. Combining excellent features of noble metals and the unique structural traits of porous nanostructures, NMAs are of high interest in diverse fields, such as catalysis, sensors, and self-propulsion devices. Regardless of these achievements, it is still challenging to rationally design well-tailored NMAs in terms of ligament sizes, morphologies, and compositions and profoundly investigate the underlying gelation mechanisms. Herein, an elaborate overview of the recent progress on NMAs is given.

Many efforts have been made to develop portable sensors for monitoring heavy metals in the environment. Incorporation of nanomaterials and nanostructures into sensors leads to significant improvement in the performance of devices in terms of sensitivity, selectivity, multiplexed detection capability and portability. In addition, small molecules, DNA, proteins and bacteria have been integrated with inorganic materials to selectively bind heavy metals as the molecular recognition probes. This review presents a recent advance in optical, electrochemical and field-effect transistor sensors for heavy metal detection. The optical sensors are focused on colorimetric, fluorescent, surface-enhanced Raman scattering and surface plasmon resonance devices. In addition, optofluidic devices which integrate optical components with microfluidic chips are discussed. Furthermore, nanoparticle-modified electrodes, microelectrode (or nanoelectrode) arrays and microfluidic electrochemical sensors are summarized. This paper highlights the strategies for design of nanostructured sensors and the benefits from the use of nanomaterials and nanostructures.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aRaman spectroscopy 3abacteria 3achemical elements 3acolorimetry 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3afluorescence 3aheavy metals 3amonitoring 3ananomaterials 3apollution 3aproteins 3asensors (equipment) 3asurface plasmon resonance 0aHeavy metal 0aOptical sensor 0aElectrochemical sensor 0aNanomaterial 0aBiosensor 0aMicrofluidics 0aOptofluidics1 aGou, Honglei1 aAl-Ogaidi, Israa1 aWu, Nianqiang0 tACS sustainable chemistry .g2013 July 01, v. 1, no. 7 p.713-723dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23317x2168-04857nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/sc400019a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03023naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100001800112245010200130300001800232520183700250592002802087650001802115650001102133650001602144650002202160650001202182650001202194650001102206650001102217650001002228650001602238650002902254650002202283653001802305653002202323653001502345653001602360653002202376700002702398700002402425773014302449852000902592655001202601IND60126570620221120042525.0151124e201312  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012657062DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFail, J√≥zsef10aAntixenotic Resistance of Cabbage to Onion Thrips (Thysanoptera: Thripidae). I. Light Reflectance  ap. 2602-2612.  aOnion thrips (Thrips tabaci Lindeman) has become a significant pest of cabbage (Brasssica oleracea L.) in regions with a dry continental climate. Thrips-resistant cabbage varieties have been developed in breeding programs, but the mechanisms of resistance remain largely unknown. Antixenosis, one of the three resistance mechanisms, may play a role but no plant trait has been identified as a source of antixenosis. A series of studies were conducted to identify resistance mechanisms in this insect‚Äîcrop interaction and to seek plant traits that were correlated to resistance. In this first article of the series, the result of studying antixenosis and overall resistance of cabbage and the correlation between antixenosis and light reflectance characteristics are reported. There were distinct differences in the overall resistance to thrips between the six cabbage varieties studied. There were more pronounced differences between varieties based on the number of damaged head leaves compared with the use of damage ratings as a measure of overall resistance. Varieties also differed in their level of antixenosis; proportional abundance of thrips adults on head-forming leaves was more closely correlated to overall resistance of cabbage than actual thrips numbers. Some of the variables computed from the recorded reflectance spectra of cabbage were correlated to thrips abundance on head-forming leaves only in the first but not in the second year of this study, suggesting that either spectral characteristics do not affect antixenosis or other variables may affect thrips' responses to spectral cues. Furthermore, multiple spray applications of a kaolin particle-based product significantly changed the light reflectance characteristics of cabbage, but it did not reduce the actual thrips abundance on head-forming leaves.  aPublisher supplied data 3aThrips tabaci 3aadults 3aantixenosis 3abreeding programs 3acabbage 3aclimate 3akaolin 3aleaves 3apests 3areflectance 3areflectance spectroscopy 3aspectral analysis 0aThrips tabaci 0aBrassica oleracea 0aresistance 0aantixenosis 0alight reflectance1 aDeutschlander, Mark E.1 aShelton, Anthony M.0 tJournal of economic entomology.g2013 Dec., v. 106, no. 6 p.2602-2612dEntomological Society of AmericawJournal:jnl46276x0022-04937nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle03721naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002500150245010600175300001600281520216700297592002802464650001502492650001502507650001302522650001302535650001802548650001702566650002902583650002102612650001302633650001402646650001402660650001002674650001502684650001502699650001202714650002502726650001502751650001302766650001302779650002002792653002902812653003102841653003902872653002002911653002802931700002202959700002302981773008203004856008403086852000903170655001203179IND60564090020221116220723.0170612e20170501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056409002DNAL7 a10.1016/j.watres.2017.01.0382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 ade Vera, Glen Andrew10aPredicting reactivity of model DOM compounds towards chlorine with mediated electrochemical oxidation  ap. 113-121.  aChlorine demand of a water sample depends on the characteristics of dissolved organic matter (DOM). It is an important parameter for water utilities used to assess oxidant and/or disinfectant consumption of source waters during treatment and distribution. In this study, model compounds namely resorcinol, tannic acid, vanillin, cysteine, tyrosine, and tryptophan were used to represent the reactive moieties of complex DOM mixtures. The reactivity of these compounds was evaluated in terms of Cl2 demand and electron donating capacity (EDC). The EDC was determined by mediated electrochemical oxidation (MEO) which involves the use of 2,2‚Ä≤-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS) as an electron shuttle. The Cl2 demand of readily oxidizable compounds (resorcinol, tannic acid, vanillin, and cysteine) was found to correlate well with EDC (R2¬†=¬†0.98). The EDC values (mol e‚àí/mol C) of the model compounds are as follows: 1.18 (cysteine)¬†>¬†0.77 (resorcinol)¬†>¬†0.59 (vanillin)¬†>¬†0.52 (tannic acid)¬†>¬†0.36 (tryptophan)¬†>¬†0.19 (tyrosine). To determine the effect of pre-oxidation on EDC, ozone was added (0.1¬†mol O3/mol C) into each model compound solution. Ozonation caused a general decrease in EDC (10‚Äì40%), chlorine demand (10‚Äì30%), and UV absorbance (10‚Äì40%), except for tyrosine which showed both increased UV275 and EDC. Before and after ozonation, 24¬†h disinfection byproduct (DBP) formation potential tests (Cl2 residual¬†=¬†1.5¬†mg/L) were conducted to evaluate the use of EDC for DBP formation prediction. The results indicate that there was no significant correlation between the EDC of the model compounds and the formation potentials of adsorbable organic chlorine, trichloromethane, and trichloroacetic acid. This suggests that while EDC correlates with Cl2 demand, chlorine consumption may not directly translate to DBP formation because oxidation reactions may dominate over substitution reactions. Overall, this study provides useful insights on the reactions of ABTS+ and HOCl with model DOM compounds, and highlights the potential application of MEO for rapid determination of Cl2 demand of a water sample.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorbance 3abyproducts 3achlorine 3acysteine 3adisinfectants 3adisinfection 3adissolved organic matter 3aelectrochemistry 3aoxidants 3aoxidation 3aozonation 3aozone 3aprediction 3aresorcinol 3atannins 3atrichloroacetic acid 3atryptophan 3atyrosine 3avanillin 3awater utilities 0aDissolved organic matter 0aElectron donating capacity 0aMediated electrochemical oxidation 0aChlorine demand 0aDisinfection byproducts1 aGernjak, Wolfgang1 aRadjenovic, Jelena0 tWater research.g2017 May 01, v. 114 p.113-121dElsevier Ltdx0043-13547nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2017.01.0383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03417naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002300148245013900171300001800310500001900328520178600347592002802133650002202161650001002183650002602193650002502219650002102244650001302265650003002278650001402308650001002322650002002332650001602352650001402368650001502382650000902397650002002406651001202426700002302438700002102461700002302482700001902505700002002524700002102544700002202565700001802587700006002605773013102665856008202796852000902878655001202887IND60711426920221122143253.0200928e202010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071142692DNAL7 a10.1007/s10336-020-01793-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAddesso, Alyssa M.10aEffect of introduced parasites on the survival and microbiota of nestling cactus finches (Geospiza scandens) in the Gal√°pagos Islands  ap. 1011-1019.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aIntroduced parasites and pathogens have colonized the Gal√°pagos Islands of Ecuador. For example, a parasitic nest fly, Philornis downsi, was introduced to the Gal√°pagos and has since caused significant nestling mortality for some endemic Darwin‚Äôs finches. However, some larger bodied species of birds in the Gal√°pagos, including vegetarian finches (Platyspiza crassirostris) and Gal√°pagos mockingbirds (Mimus parvulus), can be less affected by the parasite. Our study explores the effects of P. downsi on a small population of common cactus finches (Geospiza scandens) across two breeding seasons on San Crist√≥bal Island, Gal√°pagos. Specifically, we experimentally manipulated P. downsi abundance and characterized the gut and skin microbiota, and survival of nestling finches. Because cactus finches are medium-sized birds and small- and medium-sized birds are generally negatively affected by P. downsi, we predicted that the parasite would have a similar detrimental effect on fledging success. We also determined the effect of P. downsi on the microbiota because other studies have shown that the bacterial community can be beneficial for host health (e.g., conferring immunity and nutrient absorption). Although the overall skin and gut microbiota differed, we found that parasite treatment did not affect the microbiota in either tissue. However, nestlings from parasitized nests had significantly lower fledging success (25%, on average) compared to nestlings from non-parasitized nests (79%). We found that, similar to other medium-sized species, cactus finches are negatively affected by P. downsi, which could have implications for their risk of extirpation from the island. The results of this study should be considered when managing this population of concern.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGeospiza scandens 3aMimus 3abacterial communities 3acacti and succulents 3adigestive system 3aimmunity 3aintestinal microorganisms 3amortality 3anests 3anutrient uptake 3aornithology 3aparasites 3aparasitism 3arisk 3avegetarian diet 3aEcuador1 aHarvey, Johanna A.1 aVaziri, Grace J.1 aVerrett, Taylor B.1 aAlbert, Lauren1 aArthur, Corinne1 aChernicky, Kiley1 aSimons, Shelby R.1 aChaves, Jaime1 aKnutie, Sarah A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6423-95610 tJournal of ornithology.g2020 Oct., v. 161, no. 4 p.1011-1019dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:J000001150x2193-71927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10336-020-01793-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01867naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001900152242014400171245014000315300001600455520084700471592002801318650001201346650000901358651001201367700002701379773008801406856008601494852000901580655001201589IND60112329920221120083516.0141110s2012    xx |||||o|||||||||||ger||7 aIND6011232992DNAL7 a10.1016/j.zoolgart.2012.11.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSolski, Leszek10aDetails from the early history of Verband Deutscher Zoodirektoren (VDZ) e.

(Fabales: Fabaceae), in the Palouse region of northern Idaho and eastern Washington state. Relationships between mean pea aphid density per plant (x) and the proportion of aphid-infested plants (P·µ¢) were determined by in situ visual counts of 100 plants on each of 27 seasonal dates during 2011 from early vegetative plant growth (stage V105) to late reproductive growth (stage R207) at two field sites near Moscow, ID. The best-fit Nachman model P·µ¢ = 1 - exp(-0.3616 x‚Å∞.‚Å∏‚Å∞‚Å∏) was used to restate the limits of noneconomic and economic infestations from one and three aphids per plant to 30 and 58% aphid-infested plants, respectively. Sequential decision plans were computed using the stop-line formulas of Waters for Wald's Sequential Probability Ratio Test. Validation of the sequential decision plan by simulated sampling from the 2011 data as well as from six commercial fields sampled during 2012 showed that when observed field densities either exceeded the economic injury level or were less than one third the economic injury level, the plan correctly classified aphid economic status in >99% of the resampling trials. Practical implementation of the plan is discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcyrthosiphon pisum 3aPisum sativum 3adry peas 3aeconomic threshold 3amodels 3apests 3aplant growth 3aprobability 3asocioeconomic status 3aIdaho 3aWashington (state) 0apea aphid 0aAcyrthosiphon pisum 0adry pea 0aPisum sativum 0abinomial sequential sampling1 aBechinski, Edward J.1 aEigenbrode, Sanford D.0 tJournal of economic entomology.g2013 Dec., v. 106, no. 6 p.2613-2620dEntomological Society of AmericawJournal:jnl46276x0022-04937nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle03235naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245013700167300001600304520151600320592002801836650003001864650002101894650001101915650002701926650002601953650001001979650001801989650001202007650001502019650001302034650001902047650001502066650001702081650001802098650001302116650001102129650002102140650002102161650001302182650001702195653002202212653001802234653002802252653001302280653001702293653001702310700001802327700001502345700001602360700001702376700001702393700001402410773011402424856008602538852000902624655001202633IND60723363020221119121134.0210226e20210210xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072336302DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jconrel.2021.01.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Yanan10aRecent advances of nanomedicine-based strategies in diabetes and complications management: Diagnostics, monitoring, and therapeutics  ap. 618-640.  aDiabetes mellitus (DM) is a metabolic disorder characterized by the presence of chronic hyperglycemia driven by insulin deficiency or resistance, imposing a significant global burden affecting 463 million people worldwide in 2019. This review has comprehensively summarized the application of nanomedicine with accurate, patient-friendly, real-time properties in the field of diabetes diagnosis and monitoring, and emphatically discussed the unique potential of various nanomedicine carriers (e.g., polymeric nanoparticles, liposomes, micelles, microparticles, microneedles, etc.) in the management of diabetes and complications. Novel delivery systems have been developed with improved pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, excellent drug biodistribution, biocompatibility, and therapeutic efficacy, long-term action safety, as well as the improved production methods. Furthermore, the effective nanomedicine for the treatment of several major diabetic complications with significantly improved life qualities of diabetic patients were discussed in detail. Going through the literature review, several critical issues of the nanomedicine-based strategies applications need to be addressed such as stabilities and long-term safety effects in vivo, the deficiency of standard for formulation administration, feasibility of scale-up, etc. Overall, the review provides an insight into the design, advantages and limitations of novel nanomedicine application in the diagnostics, monitoring, and therapeutics of DM.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadministrative management 3abiocompatibility 3adesign 3adiabetic complications 3adiagnostic techniques 3adrugs 3ahyperglycemia 3ainsulin 3aliterature 3amicelles 3amicroparticles 3amonitoring 3ananomedicine 3ananoparticles 3apatients 3apeople 3apharmacodynamics 3apharmacokinetics 3apolymers 3atherapeutics 0aDiabetes mellitus 0aDrug delivery 0aPolymeric nanoparticles 0aMicelles 0aMicroneedles 0aNanomedicine1 aWang, Chunhui1 aLi, Keyang1 aSong, Xinyu1 aYan, Xuefeng1 aYu, Liangmin1 aHe, Zhiyu0 tJournal of controlled release.g2021 Feb. 10, v. 330 p.618-640dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12462x0168-36597nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jconrel.2021.01.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02620naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094024002200122024001900144040001800163100002500181245011300206300001800319506007600337520110800413592002801521506003701549650002301586650002101609650002001630650001201650650001401662650001401676650001101690650001201701650001801713650001501731650001301746650001001759700001901769700002101788700002101809700001501830700002101845700002401866700002401890773012901914856007402043852000902117655001202126IND60621229920221207104847.0181116e20181115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062122992DNAL7 a10.1039/c8ay01807c2doi7 aPMC62444882pmcid7 a314904602pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGowers, Sally A.¬†N.13aAn improved rapid sampling microdialysis system for human and porcine organ monitoring in a hospital setting  ap. 5273-5281.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aOnline organ monitoring could provide clinicians with critical information regarding organ health prior to transplantation and could aid clinical decision-making. This paper presents the methodology of online microdialysis for real-time monitoring of human organs ex vivo. We describe how rapid sampling microdialysis can be incorporated with organ perfusion machines to create a robust organ monitoring system and demonstrate its use in monitoring human and porcine kidneys as well as human and porcine pancreases. In this paper we also show the potential usefulness of this methodology for evaluating novel interventions in a research setting. The analysis system can be configured either to analyse two analytes in one organ, allowing for ratiometric analysis, or alternatively to monitor one analyte in two organs simultaneously, allowing direct comparison. It was found to be reliable over long monitoring periods in real clinical use. The results clearly show that the analysis system is sensitive to differences between organs and therefore has huge potential as an ex vivo organ monitoring tool.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aanalytical methods 3achemical species 3adecision making 3aenzymes 3aequipment 3ahospitals 3ahumans 3akidneys 3amicrodialysis 3amonitoring 3apancreas 3aswine1 aHamaoui, Karim1 aVallant, Natalie1 aHanna, George B.1 aDarzi, Ara1 aCasanova, Daniel1 aPapalois, Vassilios1 aBoutelle, Martyn G.0 tAnalytical methods.g2018 Nov. 15, v. 10, no. 44 p.5273-5281dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26912x1759-96797nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c8ay01807c3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02303naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100003000152245011300182300001600295520106000311592002801371650001501399650001401414650002901428650001801457650002001475650001501495653001801510653001401528653001901542653001501561653002201576700002801598700002001626700002701646700002401673773011201697856008701809852000901896655001201905IND60096627920221121230659.0221004e201301  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009662792DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enconman.2012.07.0232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPiloto-Rodr√≠guez, Ram√≥n10aPrediction of the cetane number of biodiesel using artificial neural networks and multiple linear regression  ap. 255-261.  aModels for estimation of cetane number of biodiesel from their fatty acid methyl ester composition using multiple linear regression and artificial neural networks were obtained in this work. For the obtaining of models to predict the cetane number, an experimental data from literature reports that covers 48 and 15 biodiesels in the modeling-training step and validation step respectively were taken. Twenty-four neural networks using two topologies and different algorithms for the second training step were evaluated. The model obtained using multiple regression was compared with two other models from literature and it was able to predict cetane number with 89% of accuracy, observing one outlier. A model to predict cetane number using artificial neural network was obtained with better accuracy than 92% except one outlier. The best neural network to predict the cetane number was a backpropagation network (11:5:1) using the Levenberg‚ÄìMarquardt algorithm for the second step of the networks training and showing R=0.9544 for the validation data.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3abiodiesel 3afatty acid methyl esters 3alinear models 3aneural networks 3aprediction 0aCetane number 0aBiodiesel 0aNeural network 0aFatty acid 0aEster composition1 aS√°nchez-Borroto, Yisel1 aLapuerta, Magin1 aGoyos-P√©rez, Leonardo1 aVerhelst, Sebastian0 tEnergy conversion and management.g2013 Jan., v. 65 p.255-261dElsevier LtdwJournal:11831x0196-89047nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enconman.2012.07.0233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03415naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002400139245011200163300001400275520230000289592002802589650001102617650002302628650001202651650002502663650001502688650001402703650001902717650001302736651001102749700002902760700002402789700002602813700002102839773009902860856007302959852000903032655001203041IND60135822020221116160301.0150522e201501  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013582202DNAL7 a10.1111/jvs.122232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCarlucci, Marcos B.10aBetween‚Äê and within‚Äêspecies trait variability and the assembly of sapling communities in forest patches  ap. 21-31.  aQUESTIONS: What is the magnitude of between‚Äêspecies trait variability (BSV) and within‚Äêspecies trait variability (WSV) of specific leaf area (SLA) in a sapling meta‚Äêcommunity? To what extent do species turnover and WSV influence community‚Äêlevel mean trait responses to an environmental gradient and trait spread patterns across this gradient? What is the role of WSV for mean plant responses to environmental variation and niche partitioning in structuring sapling communities? LOCATION: Forest patches within a native grassland matrix in southern Brazil. METHODS: We recorded saplings in community plots across a canopy openness gradient in forest patches and described each of the 1129 individuals using SLA. First, we partitioned trait variation into BSV and WSV irrespective of co‚Äêoccurrence in plots. Then, using the community data, we partitioned the total variation of community‚Äêweighted trait means (CWM) and Rao's functional diversity (FD) into components explained by canopy openness, species turnover and WSV. We also partitioned the effects of WSV between and within plots on FD. Finally, we explored the responses of CWM and FD to the gradient using the whole trait variability, only BSV or only WSV. RESULTS: Specific leaf area presented a substantial proportion of variation within species (37%), although it varied more between species (63%). Species turnover and WSV explained 48% and 19% of the variation in CWM across the gradient, respectively. Species turnover and WSV explained 51% and 45% of the variation in FD across the gradient, respectively. SLA varied within species more along the gradient than within communities. Within‚Äêspecies variability enhanced shifts in CWM and FD across the gradient. Canopy openness significantly predicted CWM at all levels, and FD at all but the within‚Äêspecies level. CONCLUSIONS: Plastic responses of species mirrored the average response of communities to the environmental gradient. Within‚Äêspecies trait variability enhanced the mean plant responses to environmental variation as well as niche partitioning, and was especially important in enabling species to establish in a wider portion of the environmental gradient. Our study provides new evidence that population‚Äêlevel phenomena matter for community assembly.  aPublisher supplied data 3acanopy 3aforest communities 3aforests 3afunctional diversity 3agrasslands 3aleaf area 3aplant response 3asaplings 3aBrazil1 aDebastiani, Vanderlei J.1 aPillar, Val√©rio D.1 aDuarte, Leandro D.

This study aimed to verify the polymorphisms in the porcine IL-4 and IL-4R genes and to assess their effects on litter size traits in commercial pigs. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the porcine IL-4 and IL-4R genes were genotyped by the polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) method. A non-coding SNP of IL-4 g.134993898T > C and a non-synonymous SNP of IL-4R c.1577A > T (amino acid change at position 526, Q526L) were found to be segregating in Landrace sows. The IL-4 g.134993898T > C polymorphism was significantly associated with the number of piglets weaned alive (NWA) trait. The IL-4R c.1577A > T polymorphism was significantly associated with the number born alive (NBA) and NWA traits. Moreover, the accumulation of favorable alleles of these two SNP markers revealed significant associations with the NBA, NWA, and mean weight of piglets at weaning (MWW) traits. These findings indicate that the porcine IL-4 and IL-4R genes may contribute to the reproductive traits of pigs and could be used as candidate genes to improve litter size traits in the pig breeding industry.  aPublisher supplied data 3aamino acids 3agenotyping 3aindustry 3ainterleukin-4 3alandraces 3alitter size 3apolymerase chain reaction1 aLiu, Guisheng 1 aTeltathum, Tawatchai 1 aSupakankul, Pantaporn 1 aSringarm, Korawan 1 aNaraballobh, Watcharapong 1 aKhamlor, Trisadee 1 aChomdej, Siriwadee 1 aNganvongpanit, Korakot 1 aKrutmuang, Patcharin 1 aMekchay, Supamit 0 tAnimals.g2021 Apr. 17, v. 11, no. 4dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2274x2076-26157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ani110411543Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02794naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002500147245006600172300001400238520161900252592002801871650002001899650001301919650001001932650001301942650001201955650001001967650001301977650002201990650001202012650003502024650001302059650001502072650001502087650002002102650002102122650001002143700002302153700001702176773011002193856004802303852000902351655001202360IND50072265520221120105832.0140125e201402  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007226552DNAL7 a10.1007/s10344-013-0750-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVill√©n-P√©rez, Sara10aWintering forest birds roost in areas of higher sun radiation  ap. 59-67.  aWe analyze environmental determinants of roost site selection by tree gleaning passerines wintering in a Mediterranean montane oakwood at a craggy area of high variation in altitude and hill-shading pattern. We hypothesize that in temperate latitudes of cold winter climate, birds should spend the night in areas of low altitudes, higher temperatures, and higher solar radiation in order to minimize thermoregulation costs during resting time and to improve foraging conditions just before and after roosting. We study night occupation of woodland locations by the presence of feces in 159 wooden nest boxes (i.e., under identical controlled roosting situations). We employ GIS methods to quantify solar radiation at each location surrounding the nest boxes and data loggers to measure air temperature in the field. Birds prefer to roost in forest patches with higher solar radiation, where the period of light available for foraging is extended and thermoregulation costs during daytime are minimized. They also selected woodland patches with taller trees, a pattern consistent with their foraging preferences for trunks and branches. Other environmental variables played a negligible role in determining the selection of roost sites. Here, we show, for the first time, the importance of sun radiation determining where to spend the night in wintering birds and call attention on considering the thermal space in forest management. Forest management should preserve woodland patches with taller trees more exposed to solar radiation to enhance winter habitat suitability for birds in these Mediterranean oakwoods.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair temperature 3aaltitude 3abirds 3abranches 3aclimate 3afeces 3aforaging 3aforest management 3aforests 3ageographic information systems 3ahabitats 3anest boxes 3aphotophase 3asolar radiation 3athermoregulation 3atrees1 aCarrascal, Luis M.1 aGordo, Oscar0 tEuropean journal of wildlife research.g2014 Feb., v. 60, no. 1 p.59-67dSpringer-Verlagx1612-46427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10344-013-0750-7  aDNAL 7aarticle03080naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002300149245023100172520149900403592002801902650001701930650002501947650001701972650001301989650001202002650001602014650001302030650001702043650002102060650001302081650001602094650001402110650001902124650002002143650001302163650001602176650002502192650001802217650001502235700002102250700002002271700002202291700003102313700002402344773012602368856008302494852000902577655001202586IND60751491420221120062509.0210925e20210903xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075149142DNAL7 a10.3390/environments80900902doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlibade, Aggeliki 10aDevelopment of a Green Methodology for Simultaneous Extraction of Polyphenols and Pigments from Red Winemaking Solid Wastes (Pomace) Using a Novel Glycerol-Sodium Benzoate Deep Eutectic Solvent and Ultrasonication Pretreatment  aIn this examination, two glycerol-based deep eutectic solvents (DESs) were tested for their efficiency in the recovery of antioxidant polyphenols and anthocyanin pigments from red grape pomace (RGP). The two DESs synthesized had sodium acetate and sodium benzoate as hydrogen bond acceptors, to test the role of the hydrogen bond acceptor polarity on the extraction performance. Furthermore, the process was enhanced by an ultrasonication pretreatment stage. After initial testing with respect to water content, ultrasonication power and liquid-to-solid ratio, the DES composed of glycerol and sodium benzoate (GL-SBz) was shown to be significantly more efficient than the one made of glycerol and sodium acetate (GL-SAc). Further optimization of the extraction with regard to time and temperature demonstrated GL-SBz to be a highly effective solvent for the production of RGP extracts rich in polyphenols including gallic acid, catechin and quercetin, and pigments including malvidin 3-O-glucoside p-coumarate and malvidin 3-O-glucoside. The extracts produced also had significantly higher antiradical activity and reducing power compared to those generated with aqueous ethanol or water. From this study, evidence emerged regarding the role of the hydrogen bond acceptor nature in the extraction efficiency of polyphenols. The process developed is proposed as a green, high-performing methodology for the production of RGP extracts with enhanced polyphenolic content and antioxidant activity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanthocyanins 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3acatechin 3aethanol 3agallic acid 3aglycerol 3agrape pomace 3ahydrogen bonding 3amalvidin 3apolyphenols 3aquercetin 3asodium acetate 3asodium benzoate 3asolvents 3atemperature 3aultrasonic treatment 3awater content 3awinemaking1 aLakka, Achillia 1 aBozinou, Eleni 1 aLalas, Stavros I.1 aChatzilazarou, Arhontoula 1 aMakris, Dimitris P.0 tEnvironments.g2021 Sept. 03, v. 8, no. 9dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27132x2076-32987nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/environments80900903Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03693naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002200139245009100161300001600252520242300268592002802691650001202719650002002731650001502751650001002766650001202776650001302788650001202801650001302813650001702826650001102843650001602854650001702870650001202887650001702899650001502916650001902931650001502950651001402965700002202979700002103001700001803022773010103040856007303141852000903214655001203223IND60135822120221116160235.0150522e201501  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013582212DNAL7 a10.1111/jvs.122162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBlackhall, Melisa10aRecent fire and cattle herbivory enhance plant‚Äêlevel fuel flammability in shrublands  ap. 123-133.  aQUESTION: Could disturbance by fire and ungulate herbivory alter fire regimes by increasing flammability in shrublands and early‚Äêsuccessional forests? LOCATION: Nahuel Huapi National Park, northwest Patagonia, Argentina. METHODS: We compared four characteristics that influence fuel flammability ‚Äì fine fuel load, plant bulk density, percentage fine fuel, and percentage dead fine fuel ‚Äì and the vertical distribution of live and dead fine fuel at recently burned (<15¬†yr) and unburned (>50¬†yr) sites, both in the presence and absence of cattle, for six resprouting species: non‚Äêpalatable Lomatia hirsuta and Diostea juncea, moderately palatable Nothofagus antarctica and Schinus patagonicus, and highly palatable Maytenus boaria and Ribes magellanicum. RESULTS: Changes in flammability in response to recent fire, and to a lesser extent cattle browsing, were strongly dependent on species identity. Non‚Äêpalatable L.¬†hirsuta tended to increase in flammability following fire, whereas cattle did not affect its fuel properties. Nothofagus antarctica showed ambiguous responses: plants had reduced plant bulk density at recently burned sites, implying reduced flammability, but changes in percentage fine and dead fine fuel point to increasing flammability at burned sites with cattle. Diostea juncea and S.¬†patagonicus showed increased plant bulk density at sites with cattle and increased percentage fine fuel in response to fire. Cattle browsing was the main driver of variability in flammability for highly palatable species, showing increased plant bulk density and percentage fine fuel in response to cattle. Fire had a strong effect on the vertical distribution of live and dead fine fuel, showing an increase of burnable biomass in response to recent fire. The reduction of vertical fuel continuity was extreme on highly palatable species. In contrast, moderately and non‚Äêpalatable species, which are abundant under herbivore pressure, were characterized by vertically well‚Äêdistributed fine fuel biomass in the presence of cattle. CONCLUSIONS: Responses of flammability traits to fire and cattle depended on species identity, but the majority of the species studied showed higher fuel flammability at recently burned sites affected by cattle. Domestic livestock, by increasing the flammability of post‚Äêfire vegetation, may be key agents in altering fire regimes in forest‚Äìshrubland mosaics.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLomatia 3aMaytenus boaria 3aNothofagus 3aRibes 3aSchinus 3abiofuels 3abiomass 3abrowsing 3abulk density 3acattle 3afire regime 3aflammability 3aforests 3afuel loading 3aherbivores 3anational parks 3ashrublands 3aArgentina1 aVeblen, Thomas T.1 aRaffaele, Estela1 aMason, Norman0 tJournal of vegetation science.g2015 Jan., v. 26, no. 1 p.123-133dOpulus Pressx1100-92337nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jvs.122163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02107naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002400151245009400175520097600269592002801245650002701273650001701300650001601317650000801333650002801341650001401369650001901383653001801402653001901420653001101439700006301450700002001513700002201533773009501555856008601650852000901736655001201745IND60673925520221122234100.0200210e202002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067392552DNAL7 a10.1016/j.meatsci.2019.1079602doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aP√©rez-Baltar, Aida10aListeria monocytogenes inactivation in deboned dry-cured hams by high pressure processing  aThe effect of high pressure processing (HPP) on Listeria monocytogenes inactivation on the surface and in the interior of deboned dry-cured ham was investigated.

Dissolved oxygen tension (DOT) dropped to zero during the induction phase and it was hypothesised that this could limit product formation due to inadequate oxygen supply. A gas blending system at 20-L scale was employed to address this problem and a factorial 2¬≤ experimental design was executed to evaluate independently the effects and interaction of two main engineering factors: agitation rate and DOT level (both related to mixing and oxygen transfer in the broth) on Fab‚Äô yields. By comparison to the non-gas blending system, results in the gas blending system at same scale showed an increase in the production of Fab‚Äô by 77% independent of the DOT level when using an agitation rate of 500¬†rpm level and by 50% at an agitation rate of 1,000¬†rpm with 30% DOT. Product localisation in the cell periplasm of >90% was obtained in all fermentations. Results obtained encourage further studies at 450-L scale initially, to evaluate the potential of gas blending for the industrial production of Fab‚Äô antibody fragments.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aagitation 3aantibodies 3adissolved oxygen 3aengineering 3aexperimental design 3afermentation 3amixing 3aoxygen1 aDawson, Pierre1 aBuchanan, Ian1 aDoyle, Billy1 aFearn, Tom1 aTitchener-Hooker, Nigel1 aBaganz, Frank0 tBioprocess and biosystems engineering.g2005 Oct., v. 27, no. 6 p.365-365dSpringer-VerlagwJournal:jnl3920376x1615-75917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00449-005-0414-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02421naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100006300152245007400215520099300289592002801282650001601310650001701326650002001343650004101363650001301404650002101417653003501438653001501473653001201488653002001500653001201520653001601532653002501548653002701573700005901600700002001659700002301679700006201702700002701764773010001791856008701891852000901978655001201987IND60685600920221121075456.0200330e20200730xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068560092DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2020.1265502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEsposito, Francesco1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7781-255810aProcessing effects on acrylamide content in roasted coffee production  aAcrylamide is a toxic compound that develops during the roasting process of coffee beans. According to literature, the levels of acrylamide in coffee vary with the percentage of Robusta type in the mix and with the time-temperature parameters during the roasting process. Therefore, this study aimed to find the best roasting conditions in order to mitigate acrylamide formation. Two types of roasted coffee (Arabica and Robusta) were analyzed through GC‚ÄìMS and two clean-up methods were compared. The best roasting conditions were optimized on an industrial scale and the median levels of acrylamide decreased from the range 170‚Äì484¬†¬µg¬†kg‚Åª¬π to 159‚Äì351¬†¬µg¬†kg‚Åª¬π, after the optimization of roasting parameters. Therefore, the choice of the best conditions, according to the percentage of Robusta type in the finished product, could be an efficient mitigation strategy for acrylamide formation in coffee, maintaining the manufacturer's requirements of the finished product.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacrylamides 3acoffee beans 3acrop production 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3aroasting 3atoxic substances 0aAcrylamide (PubChem CID: 6579) 0aAcrylamide 0aRobusta 0aRoasting degree 0aGC‚ÄìMS 0aBromination 0aProcess optimization 0aSolid Phase Extraction1 aFasano, Evelina1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7966-55551 aDe Vivo, Angela1 aVelotto, Salvatore1 aSarghini, Fabrizio1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1757-75651 aCirillo Sirri, Teresa,0 tFood chemistry.g2020 July 30, v. 319 p.126550-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8139x0308-81467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2020.1265503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02874naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100005900153245008700212300001600299520140200315592002801717650001401745650001401759650001901773650002401792650001101816650001401827650002901841650000901870650001101879650001201890650001601902650001001918650001901928650001801947650000901965651001201974653002901986653001402015653001502029653002602044653003302070700002402103700002002127700001802147773010702165856008702272852000902359655001202368IND60532105920221120131752.0190402e201608  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053210592DNAL7 a10.1016/j.advwatres.2016.06.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGalesic, Morena1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8236-599110aConcentration statistics of solute transport for the near field zone of an estuary  ap. 424-440.  aRivers are considered as one of the most influential hydrological pathways for the waterborne transport and therefore estuaries are critical areas for a pollution hazard that might lead to eutrophication and general water quality deterioration. This paper is investigating the near field mixing in the estuary as the result of a combination of small scale turbulent diffusion and a larger scale variation of the advective mean velocities. In this work concentration moments were developed directly from the fundamental advection‚Äìdiffusion equation for the case of continuous, steady, conservative solute transport with the dominant stream flow mean velocity. The concentration statistics were developed considering depth integrated velocity field with mean velocity attenuation due to the wind induced currents and sea tides. In order to perform further studies of developed concentration moments, a set of velocity measurements in the local river ≈Ωrnovnica estuary near Split, Croatia, was conducted and numerical random walk particle tracking model was used to run the transport simulations based on measured velocity fields.

To help reduce this risk, the USDA‚ÄìAgricultural Research Service performed a multistate study of seasonal weather effects on cattle production across the Northern Great Plains (Wyoming, North Dakota, and Montana). Cool, wet springs and longer, cooler growing seasons increased cattle production across the Northern Great Plains. Knowledge of these seasonal weather influences on cattle production is important for management decision making, but practical application of this knowledge remains problematic. Increased enterprise flexibility to deal with variable forage production can be achieved by using seasonal weather forecasts, as well as reducing base cow-calf herd numbers to less than 100% of typical ranch carrying capacity. Yearlings or seasonal contract grazing can then be used to increase grazing to use additional forage in good years. Recently launched USDA Regional Climate Hubs will deliver science-based knowledge, practical information, management and conservation strategies, and decision tools to ranchers that will help them adapt to weather variability and changing climatic conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair temperature 3aautumn 3abeef cattle 3aclimate 3acow-calf operations 3adata collection 3adecision making 3aforage 3aforage production 3agrazing 3agrowing season 3amodels 3arain 3aranchers 3arangelands 3aseasonal variation 3asnow 3aspring 3astocking rate 3asummer 3awinter 3ayearlings 3aGreat Plains region 3aMontana 3aNorth Dakota 3aWyoming 0aranching 0aadaptive management 0aclimate change 0areducing risk 0aClimate Hubs1 aDerner, Justin D.1 aSanderson, Matt A.1 aKronberg, Scott L.1 aHendrickson, John R.1 aVermeire, Lance T.1 aPetersen, Mark K.1 aGonzalo Irisarri, J.0 tRangelands.g2015 June, v. 37, no. 3 p.119-124dElsevier Inc.wJournal:3143x0190-05287nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rala.2015.03.0033Available from publisher's site40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/609713Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  aARIS submissionbhttp://submit-u.nal.usda.gov/system/files/submissions/Reeves%20et%20al.%202015%20Rangelands.pdf  aUSDA  aDNAL 7aarticle01407naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002100139245009100160300001800251520042400269592002800693650001600721650001300737650002100750650001200771650002300783650002300806650001600829650002900845700001800874773010500892856007500997852000901072655001201081IND60578840620221120085330.0170814e20140321xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057884062DNAL7 a10.1021/ol50039722doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNguyen, Thanh V.10aAromatic Cation Activation: Nucleophilic Substitution of Alcohols and Carboxylic Acids  ap. 1720-1723.  aA new method for the nucleophilic substitution of alcohols and carboxylic acids using aromatic tropylium cation activation has been developed.

Setal loss in protonymph always starts with setae of d-series, and occurs in order, continuing to the l-series and h-series. For example, Aleurodamaeus setosus (Berlese, 1883) and Al. africanus Pletzen, 1963 lose setae of d-series in protonymph, and eight pairs in adult (c-series, l-series, h‚ÇÇ, h‚ÇÉ), so four pairs of setae remain (h‚ÇÅ, p-series). Arthrodamaeus reticulatus (Berlese, 1910), Gymnodamaeus bicostatus (C. L. Koch, 1836) and Jacotella neonominata Sub√≠as, 2004 lose also setae la and lm in protonymph, and four pairs (c-series, lp), five pairs (c-series, lp, h‚ÇÉ) and six pairs (c-series, lp, h‚ÇÇ, h‚ÇÉ) in adults, respectively, so six pairs (h-, p-series), five pairs (h‚ÇÅ, h‚ÇÇ, p-series) and four pairs of setae (h‚ÇÅ, p-series) remain, respectively. Licnodamaeus costula Grandjean, 1931 loses additionally seta lp, and Licnobelba latiflabellata (Paoli, 1908) also lose seta h‚ÇÇ in protonymph, and setae of c-series in adults, so six pairs of setae (h-series, p-series) remain in the former species, and four pairs (h‚ÇÅ, p-series) in the latter species.

Despite great efforts on the development of antibiotics and antimicrobial agents, there is still a great need to develop a strategy to early detect bacterial infections and eradicate bacteria effectively and simultaneously. The innate immune systems of various organisms produce antimicrobial peptides, which kill a broad range of bacteria with minimal cytotoxicity to mammalian cells. Therefore, antimicrobial peptides have recently attracted increasing attention as an alternative to conventional antibiotics in antibacterial medications. Here, we report a new family of antibacterial agents, which is formulated from self-assembly of a chimeric antimicrobial lipopeptide (DSPE-HnMc) and amphiphilic biodegradable polymers. HnMc micelles could effectively bind the bacterial membrane to kill a wide spectrum of bacteria and bacterial biofilms. In the studies of mouse models of drug-resistant bacterial infections, HnMc micelles could target bacterial infections with high specificity and also kill drug-resistant bacteria effectively, demonstrating the great potential of HnMc micelles as imaging and targeted antibacterial agents. These findings also provide new insight into the design of antimicrobial peptide-based nanomedicine for detection and treatment of bacterial infections.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantimicrobial peptides 3abiodegradability 3abiofilm 3acytotoxicity 3alipopeptides 3amice 3amicelles 3amultiple drug resistance 3ananomedicine 3anew family 3atherapeutics 0aantimicrobial peptide 0ainfection 0aantibacterial therapy 0abacterial targeting1 aKo, Changgon1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3972-71971 aHyeon, Hyejin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3816-53321 aJang, Mi-Kyeong1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2833-32161 aLee, Dongwon1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3035-63420 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2020 Nov. 25, v. 12, no. 49 p.54306-54315dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.0c130833Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02302naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001800152245004700170300001400217520097200231592002801203650002501231650001101256650002101267650002301288650001801311650002901329650001901358650001301377650001301390650000901403700001601412700001801428700001701446700001601463700001201479700002101491700001701512700001801529700001801547700001401565700001801579773010501597856008601702990002301788852000901811655001201820IND60113272220221121022809.0141111e20131201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011327222DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jelechem.2013.01.0242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aInnocenti, M.10aElectrochemical growth of Cu‚ÄìZn sulfides  ap. 17-21.  aThe ElectroChemical Atomic Layer Deposition (ECALD) methodology was proposed as a new approach to synthesize thin films of ternary Cu‚ÄìZn sulfides, technologically relevant for photovoltaic semiconductors, characterized by low cost of raw materials and absence of toxicity. An electrochemical characterization of the film was carried out by stripping voltammetry in order to set up the most opportune conditions for depositing Zn. The anodic stripping voltammetry points to the formation of a mixed Cu‚ÄìZn sulfide in the film: this approach represents probably the first successful synthesis of a ternary Cu‚ÄìZn sulfide. The chemical composition of the films was determined through ICP-OES analysis, and a Cu/Zn ratio equal to about 6 was evidenced. The optical properties of the ECALD film were investigated through Diffuse Reflectance Spectroscopy. The experimental band gap value confirms the potential applications of these compounds for photovoltaic purposes.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical composition 3acopper 3aelectrochemistry 3aoptical properties 3araw materials 3areflectance spectroscopy 3asemiconductors 3asulfides 3atoxicity 3azinc1 aBecucci, L.1 aBencist√†, I.1 aCarretti, E.1 aCinotti, S.1 aDei, L.1 aDi Benedetto, F.1 aLavacchi, A.1 aMarinelli, F.1 aSalvietti, E.1 aVizza, F.1 aForesti, M.L.0 tJournal of electroanalytical chemistry.g2013 Dec. 1, v. 710 p.17-21dElsevier B.V.x1572-66577nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jelechem.2013.01.0243Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02153naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100003000150245014700180300001600327520092300343592002801266650001301294650002001307650001601327650001701343651001001360651002101370651000901391651001701400653001201417653002101429653001701450653001601467653003801483653001601521653002101537653001901558773010601577856005101683852000901734655001201743IND50087644020221118234213.0140412e20120201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008764402DNAL7 a10.1080/00222933.2011.6424152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAndr√°ssy, I.q(Istv√°n),10aOn the ‚ÄúParactinolaimus‚Äù genus group (Nematoda: Actinolaimidae), with description of five new and two rare species of Egtitus Thorne, 1967  ap. 453-494.  aFive genera of the family Actinolaimidae, subfamily Actinolaiminae are united in the ‚ÄúParactinolaimus‚Äù genus group.

The Nantucket pine tip moth, Rhyacionia frustrana (Comstock), in particular, often reduces growth of loblolly pine but has been difficult to control with traditional insecticides due to multiple annual generations and multi-year infestations which are difficult to predict in timing and location. Relatively new systemic insecticide products offer a solution in that their efficacy persists through multiple generations and years after a single application. Efficacy of systemic imidacloprid and fipronil were evaluated side by side across multiple sites in Virginia. Significant reductions in Nantucket pine tip moth damage were noted in trees treated with either the imidacloprid or fipronil product compared with check trees. After 2 yr, growth improvement of treated trees relative to controls was modest and not significant at all sites, but per acre volume indices were significantly greater in treated blocks as a result of higher tree survival. Reduced seedling mortality was attributed primarily to prevention of damage by pales weevil, Hylobius pales Herbst (Coleoptera: Curculionidae), by both insecticide treatments. Control of pales weevil in addition to pine tip moth suggests that systemic insecticide products with a long window of efficacy might control additional nontargeted pests. 3aHylobius pales 3aPinus taeda 3aRhyacionia frustrana 3afipronil 3aimidacloprid 3amortality 3amoths 3apests 3aplantations 3aseedlings 3atrees 2aAnimals 2aImidazoles 2aInsect Controlxmethods 2aInsecticides 2aMoths 2aNitro Compounds 2aPinus taedaxparasitology 2aPyrazoles 2aWeevils 3aVirginia1 aCreighton, Jerre0 tJournal of economic entomology.g2011 Aug., v. 104, no. 4 p.1272-1279dEntomological Society of Americax0022-04937nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1603/EC104463Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle01349naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002300139245012700162300001800289520040800307592002800715650001500743650001900758650002300777650002300800700002600823700002100849773010500870856007500975852000901050655001201059IND60578840920221120114937.0170814e20140321xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057884092DNAL7 a10.1021/ol500403x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKaicharla, Trinadh10aPractical Synthesis of Phthalimides and Benzamides by a Multicomponent Reaction Involving Arynes, Isocyanides, and CO2/H2O  ap. 1728-1731.  aTransition-metal-free multicomponent reactions involving arynes and isocyanides with either CO‚ÇÇ or H‚ÇÇO have been reported.

Given recent interest in the regeneration of longleaf pine ecosystems, understanding how these two species will respond to drier conditions associated with climate change will be critically important. We conducted a progressive water-stress experiment on germinants of P. palustris and P. taeda over the course of 9¬†weeks, measuring gas exchange, allometry, water relations, and tracheid anatomy. P. palustris developed more overall biomass, had wider tracheids, allocated more of its biomass into leaf tissue, and maintained a narrower safety margin against hydraulic failure than P. taeda. Both species reduced leaf gas exchange as water stress increased, though P. palustris experienced earlier and greater declines in photosynthetic rates than P. taeda. The greater aboveground growth and narrower hydraulic safety margin observed in P. palustris represents a trade-off between growth and hydraulic safety and is likely related to the species‚Äô defensive strategy against fire. We suggest that this trade-off may limit P. palustris germinant regeneration on sandier, xeric sites as climate change intensifies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPinus palustris 3aPinus taeda 3aallometry 3abiomass 3aclimate change 3aecosystems 3agas exchange 3aleaves 3aphotosynthesis 3aphysiological response 3aseedlings 3atracheids 3awater stress 3aSoutheastern United States 0aLongleaf pine savanna 0aP. taeda 0aDrought 0aRestoration 0aLeaf gas exchange 0aHydraulic safety margins1 aO'Keefe, Kimberly1 aAugustine, Steven P.1 aMcCulloh, Katherine A.0 tForest ecology and management.g2020 Feb. 15, v. 458 p.117647-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl9013x0378-11277nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2019.1176473Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03071naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245017700163300001600340520143400356592002801790650002201818650002601840650002301866650001601889650002201905650001801927650001701945650001501962650001401977650001801991650002702009650001602036650002402052650001602076650001402092700001702106700001702123700001702140700001902157700001802176700001802194700001902212700002002231700001802251700001902269700001902288773014302307856008202450852000902532655001202541IND60590098020221116200817.0180619e201803  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059009802DNAL7 a10.1007/s00449-017-1867-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee, SangIl10aProcess development of oxalic acid production in submerged culture of Aspergillus niger F22 and its biocontrol efficacy against the root-knot nematode Meloidogyne incognita  ap. 345-352.  aOxalic acid has potent nematicidal activity against the root-knot nematode Meloidogyne incognita. In this study, fermentation parameters for oxalic acid production in submerged culture of Aspergillus niger F22 at 23, 25, and 30¬†¬∞C were optimized in 5-L jar fermenters. The viscosity of the culture broth increased with increasing temperature. There was a negative correlation between oxalic acid production and the apparent viscosity; high volumetric productivity of oxalic acid was obtained at low apparent viscosity (less than 1000¬†cP), with a productivity of more than 100¬†mg/L h. When the apparent viscosity was over 2500¬†cP, the volumetric productivity decreased below 50¬†mg/L h. In addition, the volumetric mass transfer coefficient, K L a, positively correlated with volumetric productivity. When the K L a value increased from 0.0 to 0.017¬†/s, the volumetric productivity proportionally increased up to 176¬†mg/L h. When the temperature decreased, K L a increased due to the decrease in viscosity, leading to increased volumetric productivity. The highest productivity of 7453.3¬†mg/L was obtained at the lowest temperature, i.e., 23¬†¬∞C. The nematicidal activity of culture filtrate was proportional to the content of oxalic acid. Based on a constant impeller tip speed, oxalic acid production was successfully scaled up to a 500-L pilot vessel, producing a final concentration comparable to that in the 5-L jar.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAspergillus niger 3aMeloidogyne incognita 3abiological control 3acorrelation 3aculture filtrates 3aculture media 3afermentation 3afermenters 3aimpellers 3amass transfer 3anematicidal properties 3aoxalic acid 3aroot-knot nematodes 3atemperature 3aviscosity1 aLee, KeonJin1 aChun, HoHyun1 aHa, Sanghyun1 aGwak, HyunJung1 aKim, HoMyeong1 aLee, Jong-Hee1 aChoi, Hak-Jong1 aKim, HyeongHwan1 aShin, TeakSoo1 aPark, HaeWoong1 aKim, Jin-Cheol0 tBioprocess and biosystems engineering.g2018 Mar., v. 41, no. 3 p.345-352dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl3920376x1615-75917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00449-017-1867-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03097naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245016200167300001600329520176500345592002802110650002002138650001602158650001202174650002002186650002602206650004102232650001702273650002502290650001902315651001202334651001602346651001102362700001502373700001702388700001502405700001902420700001602439700001702455773010102472856008102573852000902654655001202663IND60440756020221116180811.0160909e201509  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6044075602DNAL7 a10.1007/s13594-015-0255-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHartmann, K.

The objective of this study was to identify parameters that allow a differentiation between Southern German Emmental cheese and Emmental cheese produced in other regions based on physical properties and volatile and non-volatile compounds. Emmental cheese samples were collected from seven German dairies located in Bavaria and Baden-Wuerttemberg (regional Emmental cheese). Additionally, generic Emmental cheeses produced in Northern Germany, the Netherlands and Poland (European Emmental cheese) were added to the data set as well as Swiss Emmental and Allg√§u Emmental cheeses. A large variety of characteristics was previously analysed by application of thermo-rheological methods and targeted quantification methods (e.g. GC-MS and dynamic oscillatory shear measurement). Stepwise discriminant analysis was used to identify parameters with high discriminant power. These were brightness L*, loss modulus G‚Ä≥ at 20¬†¬∞C, loss factor tan Œ¥ ‚Çò‚Çê‚Çì, 3-methylbutyric acid, acetic acid, propionic acid, Œ≥-Glu-Leu, Œ≥-Glu-Val and the peptide Ile-Val-Pro-Asn. The data set resulting from the nine parameters was subjected to linear discriminant analysis followed by a cross validation step. Regional Emmental cheese was classified correctly at 95%, whereas 75% of European Emmental cheese and 100% of Swiss and Allg√§u Emmental cheeses were correctly classified. The results are preliminary but may provide, upon further verification, a useful tool for cheese makers to identify Emmental cheese produced in different regions based on a small number of characteristic parameters and prevent product imitation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEmmental cheese 3aacetic acid 3adairies 3adata collection 3adiscriminant analysis 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3aloss modulus 3aproduct authenticity 3apropionic acid 3aGermany 3aNetherlands 3aPoland1 aDunkel, A.1 aHillmann, H.1 aHansen, D.1 aSchieberle, P.1 aHofmann, T.1 aHinrichs, J.0 tDairy science & technology.g2015 Sept., v. 95, no. 5 p.701-717dSpringer Parisx1958-55867nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13594-015-0255-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01822naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002200152245007300174300001400247520077200261592002801033650001501061650001201076650001601088650002101104650001501125650001201140650002101152650003401173700002301207700001901230773010501249856008601354990002301440852000901463655001201472IND60113272620221121003144.0141111e20131201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011327262DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jelechem.2013.01.0322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSokolov√°, Romana10aAdsorption of pesticide benfluralin at the electrochemical interface  ap. 36-40.  aThe adsorption behaviour of a dinitroaniline herbicide benfluralin was studied by means of electrochemical as well as scanning probe techniques. The double layer capacitance reflects very sensitively changes of the interfacial structure at the surfaces. This allows discrimination between a simple adsorption process and a slow transition of adsorbed film structure controlled by the mechanism of nucleation. The information about nucleation kinetics and growth mechanism of the film on the electrode was obtained from the time dependence of the double layer capacitance employing the mercury drop electrode. The phase transition may lead to the reorientation of the molecules within the adsorbed layer. These findings were supported by scanning tunneling microscopy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3abenefin 3acapacitance 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3amercury 3aphase transition 3ascanning tunneling microscopy1 aKolivo≈°ka, Viliam1 aG√°l, Miroslav0 tJournal of electroanalytical chemistry.g2013 Dec. 1, v. 710 p.36-40dElsevier B.V.x1572-66577nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jelechem.2013.01.0323Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle04306naa a2200673 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245011100171520242200282592002802704650002402732650001102756650001502767650001502782650001702797650001602814650001002830650001502840650001902855650001502874650002402889650001302913650001302926650002102939650001402960650002002974650001502994650001703009650001403026650001003040650002403050650002203074650001103096650002303107650000903130650002203139650001103161650001203172650001503184650001303199650001103212651003103223653002203254653001303276653001903289653002003308653002003328653001303348700002103361700002803382773011603410856008503526852000903611655001203620IND60673926320221122234203.0191227e20200101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067392632DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foreco.2019.1176612doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWann, Gregory T.14aThe influence of prescribed fire on wild turkeys in the Southeastern United States: A review and synthesis  aThe pine-grassland ecosystems once prevalent in the Southeastern United States were dependent on frequent fire events to maintain plant communities and avoid succession to hardwood and shrub-dominant communities. The use of prescribed fire has replaced naturally occurring fires produced from lightning strikes to maintain remaining pine-grassland systems, and to expand and promote restoration into reclaimed areas. Currently, prescribed fire is a widely accepted management tool promoted by both state and federal wildlife and land-management agencies, and is assumed to be beneficial for both game and non-game species. However, a comprehensive set of guidelines related to use of prescribed fire for promotion of wildlife is lacking for most species, including species whose dependence on fire is presumed to be critical. We reviewed available literature on prescribed fire and its influence on wild turkeys (Meleagris gallopavo) in the Southeastern distribution of its range. We reviewed extant literature relative to historical use of prescribed fire for upland gamebird management, and focused on documented effects of fire on life-history characteristics of wild turkeys, including habitat selection, demography, and movement. The literature supported preferential use of areas burned in the previous 3‚ÄØyears, with avoidance of areas lacking a recent fire history. Fire return intervals between 2 and 3‚ÄØyears were generally supported in the literature as optimal to reduce woody shrub encroachment and maintain an herbaceous understory. However, areas infrequently burned, such as mature hardwood forests, provide important habitat during fall and winter, and provide important roosting sites. Contrary to misperceptions among the public, growing-season fire appears to pose little direct risk to wild turkey nests and poults, but research on this topic is limited and only recently initiated. We lack a collective knowledge of the most appropriate spatial scale and extent of prescribed fires for wild turkeys, and a single set of values for these metrics that can be applied throughout the Southeastern U.S. is likely to be unrealistic given variations in local plant communities and landscape composition. Non-target species should be carefully considered before implementing prescribed fire regimes targeted specifically towards wild turkeys, as such fire regimes may not be optimal for other species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMeleagris gallopavo 3aautumn 3ademography 3aecosystems 3afire history 3afire regime 3afires 3agame birds 3agrowing season 3aguidelines 3ahabitat preferences 3ahabitats 3ahardwood 3ahardwood forests 3ahighlands 3aland management 3alandscapes 3alife history 3alightning 3anests 3anontarget organisms 3aplant communities 3apoults 3aprescribed burning 3arisk 3aroosting behavior 3ashrubs 3aturkeys 3aunderstory 3awildlife 3awinter 3aSoutheastern United States 0aHabitat selection 0aMovement 0aPine-grassland 0aPrescribed fire 0aReturn interval 0aSurvival1 aMartin, James A.1 aChamberlain, Michael J.0 tForest ecology and management.g2020 Jan. 01, v. 455 p.117661-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl9013x0378-11277nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2019.1176613Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01298naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001500150245008200165300001600247520042400263592002800687650001300715650001600728651001000744653001100754653001300765653001600778653001000794700001300804773010700817856005100924852000900975655001200984IND50087644420221118234314.0140412e20120301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008764442DNAL7 a10.1080/00222933.2011.6516322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXue, Wanqi10aThirteen new species of the genus Helina R.-D.

To achieve this, a photogrammetric system, which consists of a digital single-lens reflex camera (DSLR), an illuminated platform where the culture dishes are positioned and an Arduino board which controls the capturing process, was constructed. The camera was mounted on a holder which set the camera at different title angles and the platform rotated, to capture images from different directions. A software, based on stereo photogrammetry, was developed for the three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction of the samples. The proof-of-concept was demonstrated in a series of experiments with plant tissue cultures and specifically with calli cultures of Salvia fruticosa and Ocimum basilicum. For a period of 14¬†days images of these cultures were acquired and 3D-reconstructions and volumetric data were obtained. The volumetric data correlated well with the experimental measurements and made the calculation of the specific growth rate, ¬µ ‚Çò‚Çê‚Çì, possible. The ¬µ ‚Çò‚Çê‚Çì value for S. fruticosa samples was 0.14¬†day‚Åª¬π and for O. basilicum 0.16¬†day‚Åª¬π. The developed method demonstrated the high potential of this photogrammetric approach in the biological sciences.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOcimum basilicum 3aSalvia fruticosa 3abiomass 3acallus culture 3acameras 3acomputer software 3aculture dishes 3anondestructive methods 3aphotogrammetry 3aplant tissues 3aspecific growth rate 3atissue culture1 aHardner, Matthias1 aOberthuer, Patrick1 aBley, Th.,1 aSchneider, Danilo1 aLenk, Felix1http://orcid.org/0000-0002-7128-29280 tBioprocess and biosystems engineering.g2018 Mar., v. 41, no. 3 p.369-380dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl3920376x1615-75917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00449-017-1871-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04366naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245010800166300002000274520220200294592002802496596008902524596007302613596007202686596011802758650002002876650002102896650001402917650001802931650001402949650002402963650001902987650002003006650001003026650001003036650001203046650001303058650001003071650004903081650003403130650002003164650001403184650002203198650001603220650004303236650001403279650001303293650001003306650001303316700002003329700001403349700001803363700001203381700001903393700001303412700005603425773015503481856008303636852000903719655001203728IND60778472320221118121957.0220527e202206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077847232DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-022-18863-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Haoran10aCadmium induces apoptosis and autophagy in swine small intestine by downregulating the PI3K/Akt pathway  ap. 41207-41218.  aCadmium (Cd) is an environmental contaminant, which is potentially toxic. It is well known that Cd can accumulate in the liver and kidney and cause serious damage. However, few studies have investigated the mechanism of intestinal damage induced by Cd in swine. Here, we established Cd poisoning models in vivo and in vitro to explore the mechanism of intestinal injury induced by Cd in swine. The morphology of intestinal tissue cells was observed by TUNEL staining and electron microscopy, and the morphology of IPEC-J2 cells was observed by flow cytometry, Hoechst staining, and MDC staining. Cell morphological observations revealed that Cd treatment induced ileal apoptosis and autophagy. The effects of Cd on the PI3K/Akt pathway, as well as on apoptosis and autophagy-related protein expression in intestinal cells, were analyzed by western blot (WB) and the expression of mRNA was detected by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). The results showed that Cd induced autophagy by increasing the levels of autophagy markers Beclin1, Autophagy-associated gene 5 (ATG5), Autophagy-associated gene 16 (ATG16), and Microtubule-associated protein light chains 3‚Äì2 (LC3-II), and by reducing the expression levels of Mechanistic target of rapamycin kinase (mTOR) and Microtubule-associated protein light chains 3‚Äì1 (LC3-I). Cell apoptosis was induced by increasing the expression of apoptosis markers Bcl-2 associated X protein (Bax), Cysteinyl aspartate specific proteinase 9 (Caspase9), cleaved Caspase9, Cysteinyl aspartate specific proteinase 3 (Caspase3), and cleaved Caspase3, and by reducing the expression of B cell lymphoma/leukemia 2 (Bcl-2). At the same time, Cd decreased the expression of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), protein kinase B (Akt), and their phosphorylation. We treated IPEC-J2 cells with the PI3K activator 740Y-P and analyzed the morphological changes as well as autophagy and apoptosis-related gene expression. The results showed that 740Y-P could reduce apoptosis and autophagy induced by Cd. In conclusion, our findings suggest that Cd induces intestinal apoptosis and autophagy in swine by inactivating the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway.  aPublisher supplied data  aYQ2021C021cHeilongjiang Provincial Natural Science Foundation for Outstanding Youth  aNo. CARS 35-04cEarmarked Fund for China Agriculture Research System  aLBH-Q18018cHeilongjiang Provincial Postdoctoral Science Foundation  a2020TD22cCentral Public-interest Scientific Institution Basal Research Fund, Chinese Academy of Fishery Sciences 3aB-cell lymphoma 3aWestern blotting 3aapoptosis 3aaspartic acid 3aautophagy 3aelectron microscopy 3aflow cytometry 3agene expression 3agenes 3aileum 3akidneys 3aleukemia 3aliver 3anon-specific serine/threonine protein kinase 3aphosphatidylinositol 3-kinase 3aphosphorylation 3apollution 3aprotein synthesis 3aproteinases 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3arapamycin 3aresearch 3aswine 3atoxicity1 aHuang, Jiaqiang1 aYang, Jie1 aCai, Jingzeng1 aLiu, Qi1 aZhang, Xintong1 aBao, Jun1 aZhang, Ziwei1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5705-46110 tEnvironmental science and pollution research.g2022 June, v. 29, no. 27 p.41207-41218dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-022-18863-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02404naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001500152245011400167520105500281592002801336650002001364650001301384650001701397650001301414650001401427650001701441650001901458650001501477650002101492650001201513650001401525650000901539653002301548653002601571653003101597653002301628653001601651653002001667700001701687700002901704700001701733773010001750856008701850852000901937655001201946IND60768845720221118173307.0220411e20220801xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076884572DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2022.1325282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHu, Yuying10aFabrication, characterization and in vitro digestive behavior of Pickering emulsion incorporated with dextrin  aWhey protein-stabilized Pickering emulsion was incorporated with dextrin under different concentrations, and their physicochemical properties and in vitro digestive behavior were examined. The result showed that these emulsions were relatively stable at low dextrin addition (<7.5%), while droplet flocculation appeared at higher concentrations. With progressing dextrin, the apparent shear viscosity significantly increased from 1.7 to 7.3¬†mPa.s. Further insight into the digestive behaviors of emulsion incorporated with dextrin was determined using a standardized INFOGEST method. Less clump in the oral phase and increasing droplet size in the initial intestine were observed in the emulsion incorporated with dextrin. Based on dextrin incorporation, a significant decrease in the extent of lipid digestion and Œ≤-carotene bioaccessibility was presented. This study implies dextrin may be useful in controlling the texture and in vitro digestive behavior of Pickering emulsions, which may be advantageous for the designation of functional foods.  aPublisher supplied data 3abioavailability 3adextrins 3adroplet size 3adroplets 3aemulsions 3aflocculation 3afood chemistry 3aintestines 3alipid metabolism 3atexture 3aviscosity 3awhey 0aPickering emulsion 0aDextrin incorporation 0aPhysicochemical properties 0aIn vitro digestion 0aŒ≤-carotene 0aLipid digestion1 aTan, Yunbing1 aJulian McClements, David1 aWang, Lufeng0 tFood chemistry.g2022 Aug. 01, v. 384 p.132528-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8139x0308-81467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2022.1325283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03075naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001600144245023200160300001800392500002000410520147800430592002801908650003401936650001401970650001201984650001201996650001202008650001102020650001102031650001102042650001102053650004102064650001002105650004302115650001202158650002802170650001102198650001202209650001802221650001402239650002302253700001302276700001702289700001802306700001402324700001802338773011402356856007802470852000902548655001202557IND60579616420221120053616.0170824e201708  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057961642DNAL7 a10.1002/jssc.2017000332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Wenying10aIdentification of chemical components in Baidianling Capsule based on gas chromatography‚Äìmass spectrometry and high‚Äêperformance liquid chromatography combined with Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry  ap. 3188-3195.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aBaidianling Capsule, which is made from 16 Chinese herbs, has been widely used for treating vitiligo clinically. In this study, the sensitive and rapid method has been developed for the analysis of chemical components in Baidianling Capsule by gas chromatography‚Äìmass spectrometry in combination with retention indices and high‚Äêperformance liquid chromatography combined with Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry. Firstly, a total of 110 potential volatile compounds obtained from different extraction procedures including alkanes, alkenes, alkynes, ketones, ethers, aldehydes, alcohols, phenols, organic acids, esters, furans, pyrrole, acid amides, heterocycles, and oxides were detected from Baidianling Capsule by gas chromatography‚Äìmass spectrometry, of which 75 were identified by mass spectrometry in combination with the retention index. Then, a total of 124 components were tentatively identified by high‚Äêperformance liquid chromatography combined with Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry. Fifteen constituents from Baidianling Capsule were accurately identified by comparing the retention times with those of reference compounds, others were identified by comparing the retention times and mass spectrometry data, as well as retrieving the reference literature. This study provides a practical strategy for rapidly screening and identifying the multiple constituents of a complex traditional Chinese medicine.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOriental traditional medicine 3aaldehydes 3aalkanes 3aalkenes 3aalkynes 3aamides 3aesters 3aethers 3afurans 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3aherbs 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3aketones 3aorganic acids and salts 3aoxides 3aphenols 3arapid methods 3ascreening 3avolatile compounds1 aChen, Yu1 aWang, Binjie1 aSun, Xiaoyang1 aGuo, Ping1 aChen, Xiaohui0 tJournal of separation science.g2017 Aug., v. 40, no. 16 p.3188-3195dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx1615-93067nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jssc.2017000333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02759naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100005500152245018600207520094600393592002801339650002401367650001601391650001101407650004101418650002301459650001301482650001901495650001001514650000901524650001301533650003201546650001101578650003501589650001001624653004701634653005801681653003601739653003001775653000801805653002701813700001501840700005501855700001601910700001501926700001601941700002001957700005601977773010002033856008702133852000902220655001202229IND60685601620221121173706.0200330e20200730xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068560162DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2020.1265642doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Yuping1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6680-838510aCharacterization of the potent odorants in Zanthoxylum armatum DC Prodr. pericarp oil by application of gas chromatography‚Äìmass spectrometry‚Äìolfactometry and odor activity value  aZanthoxylum armatum DC Prodr. pericarp (ZAP) is an important spice because of its unique odor and taste. ZAP oil was obtained by supercritical carbon dioxide extraction. To characterize potent odorants in ZAP oil, volatiles were isolated by headspace solid-phase microextraction and solvent-assisted flavor evaporation. Gas chromatography‚Äìmass spectrometry‚Äìolfactometry analyses identified a total of 32 odor-active compounds, and their flavor dilution (FD) factors, ranging from 2 to 4096, were measured by aroma extract dilution analysis. To further determine their contributions to the characteristic odor of ZAP oil, 24 odorants with FD factors ‚â•8 were quantitated, and their odor activity values (OAVs) were calculated. Sixteen compounds with OAVs ‚â•1 contributed to the characteristic aroma profile of ZAP oil. Linalool had the highest FD factor, concentration and OAV, and its chiral structure was identified as S-(+)-linalool.  aPublisher supplied data 3aZanthoxylum armatum 3aevaporation 3aflavor 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3aheadspace analysis 3alinalool 3aodor compounds 3aodors 3aoils 3apericarp 3asolid phase microextraction 3aspices 3asupercritical fluid extraction 3ataste 0aZanthoxylum armatum DC Prodr. pericarp oil 0aGas chromatography‚Äìmass spectrometry‚Äìolfactometry 0aAroma extract dilution analysis 0aQuantitative measurements 0aOAV 0aPotent aroma compounds1 aLi, Qingru1 aYang, Wenxi1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6306-17141 aSun, Baoguo1 aZhou, Ying1 aZheng, Yang1 aHuang, Mingquan1 aYang, Wenjie1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6306-17140 tFood chemistry.g2020 July 30, v. 319 p.126564-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8139x0308-81467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2020.1265643Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03234naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100006000147245011200207300001400319520179800333592002802131650002202159650001502181650002802196650003002224650002002254650001502274650002702289650001502316650002402331650001302355650001502368650002102383650001602404650001402420650001202434650001002446650001002456651001002466700001802476700002102494700001902515700002002534773010702554856008202661852000902743655001202752IND60588738820221120163724.0180619e201801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058873882DNAL7 a10.1007/s11056-017-9604-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOmondi, StephenF.1http://orcid.org/0000-0003-1931-267210aMating patterns of the gum arabic tree (Acacia senegal synonym Senegalia senegal) in two different habitats  ap. 53-65.  aUnderstanding the variation of mating patterns in disturbed habitats provide insight into the evolutionary potential of plant species and how they persist over time. However, this phenomenon is poorly understood in tropical dryland tree species. In the present study, we investigated how Acacia senegal reproduces in two different environmental contexts in Kenya. Open-pollinated progeny arrays of 10 maternal trees from each environmental context were genotyped using 12 nuclear microsatellite markers. Overall, A. senegal displayed a predominantly allogamous mating pattern. However, higher multilocus outcrossing rate (tm) was found in Lake Bogoria (tm¬†=¬†1.00) than in Kampi ya Moto population (tm¬†=¬†0.949). Higher biparental inbreeding (t ‚Çò ‚àí¬†t ‚Çõ =¬†0.116) and correlation of outcrossed paternity (rp¬†=¬†0.329) was found in Kampi ya Moto than in Lake Bogoria population (t ‚Çò ‚àí¬†t ‚Çõ =¬†0.074, rp¬†=¬†0.055), showing the occurrence of mating among relatives. Coefficient of coancestry (Œò¬†=¬†0.208) showed that full-sibs constitute about 21% of the offspring in Kampi ya Moto population compared to about 14% (Œò¬†=¬†0.136) in Lake Bogoria population. The results demonstrate that low adult tree density of A. senegal may be promoting seed production through consanguineous mating and suggest that man-made disturbance can affect mating patterns of the species. Despite these mating differences, trees from both populations can contribute as seed source for conservational plans, and to support effective genetic conservation and artificial regeneration programs of A. senegal. We suggest collection of seeds from at least 42 and 63 trees in Lake Bogoria and Kampi ya Moto populations, respectively, to retain a progeny array with a total effective population size of 150.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSenegalia senegal 3aarid lands 3aartificial regeneration 3aeffective population size 3agenetic markers 3agenotyping 3agermplasm conservation 3agum arabic 3ahabitat destruction 3ahabitats 3ainbreeding 3aopen pollination 3aoutcrossing 3apaternity 3aprogeny 3aseeds 3atrees 3aKenya1 aOdee, DavidW.1 aOngamo, GeorgeO.1 aKanya, JamesI.1 aKhasa, DamaseP.0 tNew forests.g2018 Jan., v. 49, no. 1 p.53-65dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl40921x0169-42867nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11056-017-9604-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03301naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001900139245012300158300001600281500002000297520170400317592002802021596005902049650004202108650001502150650001402165650001002179650002102189650001202210650002002222650002002242650002002262650002402282650003002306650001802336650001402354700002002368700002102388700001802409700001202427700002002439700002202459700006002481700005902541773012402600856007402724852000902798655001202807IND60773195820221119144311.0220412e202205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077319582DNAL7 a10.1111/mpp.131862doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Rui‚ÄêFang10aMcvR, a single domain response regulator regulates motility and virulence in the plant pathogen Xanthomonas campestris  ap. 649-663.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aSignal transduction pathways mediated by sensor histidine kinases and cognate response regulators control a variety of physiological processes in response to environmental conditions in most bacteria. Comparatively little is known about the mechanism(s) by which single‚Äêdomain response regulators (SD‚ÄêRRs), which lack a dedicated output domain but harbour a phosphoryl receiver domain, exert their various regulatory effects in bacteria. Here we have examined the role of the SD‚ÄêRR proteins encoded by the phytopathogen Xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris (Xcc). We describe the identification and characterization of a SD‚ÄêRR protein named McvR (motility, chemotaxis, and virulence‚Äêrelated response regulator) that is required for virulence and motility regulation in Xcc. Deletion of the mcvR open reading frame caused reduced motility, chemotactic movement, and virulence in Xcc. Global transcriptome analyses revealed the McvR had a broad regulatory role and that most motility and pathogenicity genes were down‚Äêregulated in the mcvR mutant. Bacterial two‚Äêhybrid and protein pull‚Äêdown assays revealed that McvR did not physically interact with components of the bacterial flagellum but interacts with other SD‚ÄêRR proteins (like CheY) and the subset of DNA‚Äêbinding proteins involved in gene regulation. Site‚Äêdirected mutagenesis and phosphor‚Äêtransfer experiments revealed that the aspartyl residue at position 55 of the receiver domain is important for phosphorylation and the regulatory activity of McvR protein. Taken together, the findings describe a previously unrecognized class of SD‚ÄêRR protein that contributes to the regulation of motility and virulence in Xcc.  aPublisher supplied data  a32160036cNational Natural Science Foundation of China 3aXanthomonas campestris pv. campestris 3achemotaxis 3aflagellum 3agenes 3ahistidine kinase 3amutants 3aphosphorylation 3aplant pathogens 3aplant pathology 3asignal transduction 3asite-directed mutagenesis 3atranscriptome 3avirulence1 aRen, Pei‚ÄêDong1 aLiu, Qian‚ÄêQian1 aYao, Jia‚ÄêLi1 aWu, Liu1 aZhu, Gui‚ÄêNing1 aXian, Xiao‚ÄêYong1 aTang, Ji‚ÄêLiang1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0891-12261 aLu, Guang‚ÄêTao1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5082-97550 tMolecular plant pathology.g2022 May, v. 23, no. 5 p.649-663dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl60298x1464-67227nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/mpp.131863Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03243naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002600113040001800139100002400157245012500181300001800306520167900324592002802003650001802031650001902049650002202068650001702090650001402107650001102121650001202132650001002144650001102154650002002165650001502185650001202200650002302212650002902235650001102264650002402275650002002299650003002319650005102349650004102400700002102441700002102462700001902483700001302502700002702515773012302542856003902665852000902704655001202713IND50059081020221118033447.0121011e201208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5005908102DNAL7 a225735192pmid7 a10.1002/etc.18762doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPandolfo, Tamara J.10aAcute effects of road salts and associated cyanide compounds on the early life stages of the unionid mussel Villosa iris  ap. 1801-1806.  aThe toxicity of cyanide to the early life stages of freshwater mussels (order Unionida) has remained unexplored. Cyanide is known to be acutely toxic to other aquatic organisms. Cyanide‚Äêcontaining compounds, such as sodium ferrocyanide and ferric ferrocyanide, are commonly added to road deicing salts as anticaking agents. The purpose of the present study was to assess the acute toxicity of three cyanide compounds (sodium cyanide, sodium ferrocyanide, and ferric ferrocyanide), two road salts containing cyanide anticaking agents (Morton and Cargill brands), a brine deicing solution (Liquidow brand), and a reference salt (sodium chloride) on glochidia (larvae) and juveniles of the freshwater mussel Villosa iris. Sodium ferrocyanide and ferric ferrocyanide were not acutely toxic to glochidia and juvenile mussels at concentrations up to 1,000‚Äâmg/L and 100‚Äâmg/L, respectively. Lowest observed effect concentrations (LOECs) for these two chemicals ranged from 10 to >1,000‚Äâmg/L. Sodium cyanide was acutely toxic to juvenile mussels, with a 96‚Äêh median effective concentration (EC50) of 1.10‚Äâmg/L, although glochidia tolerated concentrations up to 10‚Äâmg/L. The EC50s for sodium chloride, Liquidow brine, Morton road salt, and Cargill road salt were not significantly different for tests within the same life stage and test duration (range, 1.66‚Äì4.92‚Äâg/L). These results indicate that cyanide‚Äêcontaining anticaking agents do not exacerbate the toxicity of road salts, but that the use of road salts and brine solutions for deicing or dust control on roads may warrant further investigation.

Recent studies have reported an increasing dominance of American beech in the understory and midstory of these forests. Beech is a commercially less desirable tree species due to its association with beech-bark disease, and because it commonly interferes with the regeneration of other more desirable tree species. We examined hardwood regeneration characteristics nine years after application of a 3¬†√ó¬†4 factorial combination of glyphosate herbicide (0.56, 1.12, and 1.68¬†kg¬†ha‚Åª¬π) and surfactant concentrations (0.0, 0.25, 0.5, and 1.0% v v‚Åª¬π) to release sugar maple regeneration from beech-dominated understories using three stands that received shelterwood seed cutting in central Maine. Measurements nine years after treatment showed that glyphosate rate increased both absolute (AD) and relative density (RD) of sugar maple regeneration, but not its height (HT). In contrast, beech AD, RD, and HT were all significantly reduced with increasing glyphosate rate. Post-release browsing by ungulates and a high residual overstory basal area resulted in reduced sugar maple HT. Our results indicated that glyphosate herbicide applied in stands that have been recently shelterwood seed cut can significantly increase the abundance of sugar maple regeneration. However, subsequent browsing damage combined with the negative influence of the residual overstory cover can limit the longer-term benefit of understory herbicide treatments. Subsequent removal of the overstory and browsing-control measures may be needed to promote sugar maple regeneration over beech in similar northern hardwood stands.  aPublisher supplied data 3aungulates 3apesticide application 3ahardwood 3alandscapes 3ahardwood forests 3aBetula alleghaniensis 3acutting 3asurfactants 3aFagus grandifolia 3atrees 3aglyphosate 3ashelterwood systems 3aAcer saccharum subsp. saccharum 3abrowsing damage 3astand basal area 3abrowsing 3aunderstory 3aoverstory 3aCanada 3aMaine 0abasal area1 aWagner, RobertG.1 aRoth, BrianE.1 aWeiskittel, AaronR.0 tNew forests.g2018 Jan., v. 49, no. 1 p.67-85dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl40921x0169-42867nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11056-017-9605-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03720naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245013100169520230500300592002802605650001102633650002402644650001002668650002202678650001202700650001302712650002802725650001102753650001202764650002302776650002502799650002302824650000802847650001102855650002202866650001002888651001802898700002302916700001802939700002202957700002402979700001903003773013403022856008503156852000903241655001203250IND60672773820221121015435.0191017e20190613xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067277382DNAL7 a10.1093/cdn/nzz039.FS10-02-192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHarnack, Lisa10aGluten Content of Brand Name Food Products in a Food and Nutrient Database That Includes Leading U.S. Food Brands (FS10-02-19)  aDescribe the gluten content of leading U.S. brands of cookies, crackers, hot cereals, ready-to-eat (RTE) cereals, specially formulated bars (e.g., Clif, Luna bars), granola bars, savory snacks, and candies. To address the needs of researcherers examining the role of gluten in gastrointestinal health, gluten was added to a U.S. food and nutrient database. Few foods have been chemically analyzed for their gluten content. Thus, gluten values were assigned to foods based on the assumptions that: 1) foods that do not include any gluten containing grains or their derivatives- wheat, rye or barley may be presumed to contain 0 grams of gluten; and 2) a specified fraction of vegetable protein found in wheat, rye, barley and their derivatives (0.75) may be presumed to be gluten (factor selected based on studies in which gluten content of some gluten containing grains were determined by chemical analysis). Gluten values were assigned to brand name products in the database, thus presenting a unique opportunity to describe the gluten content of brand name products in the U.S. marketplace. For each food category the % of products containing gluten was calculated, and the mean and range in gluten content among gluten containing products were determined. Food categories with the highest proportion of products containing gluten were cookies (97.1%), crackers (82.7%), hot cereals (66.0%), and RTE cereals (64.8%). Categories with the lowest proportions were candies (15.7%) and savory snacks (25.0%). The mean gluten content among gluten containing products was highest for hot cereals (2.62 grams/serving), crackers (1.82 grams/serving), RTE cereals (1.76 grams/serving), and savory snacks (1.51 grams/serving). Granola bars and specially formulated bars had the lowest content (0.27 and 0.31 grams/serving respectively). The range in gluten content per serving for gluten containing products was lowest for granola bars (0.002‚Äì1.11 grams/serving) and highest for RTE cereals (0.001‚Äì7.03 grams/serving). There is considerable variation in the gluten content of brand name products in the categories examined in this study. Studies quantifying dietary gluten intake may need to consider using a dietary assessment method that captures product brand.

Aggregate production functions are estimated on the cross‚Äêcountry data; and, with the estimates of production elasticities, the productivity differences between India and United States and between India and Japan are accounted for by conventional inputs (labor, land, fertilizer and machinery) and nonconventional inputs (education and research). The measured contributions of respective factors to the productivity differences provide a guideline for allocating development efforts in the less developed countries.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural productivity 3adeveloping countries 3aeducation 3aelasticities 3afertilizers 3aguidelines 3alabor 3aproduction functions 3aIndia 3aJapan 3aUnited States0 tAmerican journal of agricultural economics.g1969 Aug., v. 51, no. 3 p.564-575dOxford University PresswJournal:jnl44932x0002-90927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2307/12379093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03321naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001600155245012500171300001600296520169500312592002802007650001602035650002202051650001802073650001402091650001002105650002702115650002102142650001002163650001402173650001302187650001402200650002302214650001702237653003702254653002202291653001202313653002102325700001902346700001402365700001802379700002602397700001402423700001502437700001902452700001902471700001402490700001802504700001302522773013302535856009002668852000902758655001202767IND60570353220221120215056.0180914e201710  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057035322DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijantimicag.2017.05.0172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPaiva, J.A.10aDrivers and impact of antifungal therapy in critically ill patients with Aspergillus-positive respiratory tract cultures  ap. 529-535.  aInvasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA) is an increasingly recognised problem in critically ill patients. Little is known about how intensivists react to an Aspergillus-positive respiratory sample or the efficacy of antifungal therapy (AFT). This study aimed to identify drivers of AFT prescription and diagnostic workup in patients with Aspergillus isolation in respiratory specimens as well as the impact of AFT in these patients. ICU patients with an Aspergillus-positive respiratory sample from the database of a previous observational, multicentre study were analysed. Cases were classified as proven/putative IPA or Aspergillus colonisation. Demographic, microbiological, diagnostic and therapeutic data were collected. Outcome was recorded 12 weeks after Aspergillus isolation. Patients with putative/proven IPA were more likely to receive AFT than colonised patients (78.7% vs. 25.5%; P‚Äâ<‚Äâ0.001). Patients with host factors for invasive fungal disease were more likely to receive AFT (72.5% vs. 37.4%) as were those with multiorgan failure (SOFA score >7) (68.4% vs. 36.9%) (both P‚Äâ<‚Äâ0.001). Once adjusted for disease severity, initiation of AFT did not alter the odds of survival (HR‚Äâ=‚Äâ1.40, 95% CI 0.89‚Äì2.21). Likewise, treatment within 48‚Äâh following diagnosis did not change the clinical outcome (75.7% vs. 61.4%; P‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.63). Treatment decisions appear to be based on diagnostic criteria and underlying disease severity at the time of Aspergillus isolation. IPA in this population has a dire prognosis and AFT is not associated with reduced mortality. This may be explained by delayed diagnosis and an often inevitable death due to advanced multiorgan failure.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAspergillus 3aantifungal agents 3aaspergillosis 3adatabases 3adeath 3ademographic statistics 3adisease severity 3afungi 3amortality 3apatients 3aprognosis 3arespiratory system 3atherapeutics 0aInvasive pulmonary aspergillosis 0aDelayed diagnosis 0aTherapy 0aCritical illness1 aMergulh√£o, P.1 aGomes, A.1 aTaccone, F.S.1 aVan den Abeele, A.-M.1 aBulpa, P.1 aMisset, B.1 aMeersseman, W.1 aDimopoulos, G.1 aRello, J.1 aVogelaers, D.1 aBlot, S.0 tInternational journal of antimicrobial agents.g2017 Oct., v. 50, no. 4 p.529-535dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12451x0924-85797nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijantimicag.2017.05.0173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02128naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001500151245008400166300001600250520074100266592002801007650003401035650002901069650002601098650002001124650002501144650003601169650001901205650002201224650002001246650002301266653001401289653002201303653002701325653002301352700001801375700001601393700001701409700001901426700001901445773012401464856008501588852000901673655001201682IND60679764520221120050147.0191231e201912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067976452DNAL7 a10.1016/S1875-5364(19)30115-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Yue,10aTwo folate-derived analogues from an aqueous decoction of Uncaria rhynchophylla  ap. 928-934.  aTwo new folate-derived analogues, named uncarophyllofolic acids A (1) and B (2), respectively, were isolated from the Uncaria rhynchophylla hook bearing stem (Gouteng in Chinese).

Three different restoration treatments including natural regeneration (NR), artificial regeneration (AR), and artificial promotion (AP), were adopted in the Greater Hinggan Mountain area of China after a serious fire occurred on May 6, 1987. NR is a control treatment where recovery occurs naturally without intervention, AR comprises salvage logging followed by planting, while AP includes regeneration by removing dead trees, weeding, and tidying to promote seed germination. In this study, the objective was to detect and compare the effects of the three restoration treatments using radar indices derived from ALOS/PALSAR data. Four time-series SAR images were pre-processed to acquire the backscattering coefficients. Then the coefficients in both HH and HV polarization were examined and two radar vegetation indices were derived and evaluated, based on which, the post-fire forest dynamics under different restoration treatments were detected and compared. The results showed that the forests under NR presented a completely different recovery trajectory compared to those under the other two treatments. This difference could be characterized by both the backscattering intensity in HH and HV polarization and two radar indices. This study indicated the effects of different restoration treatments, as well as demonstrated the applicability and efficiency of radar remote sensing techniques in forest monitoring and management.  aPublisher supplied data 3aartificial regeneration 3adead wood 3aforest dynamics 3aforest management 3aforests 3amonitoring 3anatural regeneration 3aplanting 3aradar 3aremote sensing 3asalvage logging 3aseed germination 3atime series analysis 3avegetation index 3aweed control 3aChina1 aJiang, Houzhi1 aMoriya, Kazuyuki1 aSakai, Tetsuro1 aCao, Chunxiang0 tNew forests.g2018 Jan., v. 49, no. 1 p.105-121dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl40921x0169-42867nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11056-017-9608-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03545naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005900150245008800209300001600297520186700313592002802180650002802208650001802236650002202254650001602276650001102292650002502303650001202328650001902340650001402359650001402373650001902387650001302406650003702419650002402456650001702480650001302497650003202510653002002542653001302562653002202575653001302597653001102610700001602621700001802637700002002655700002102675700001802696700002702714700002202741700002602763773008502789856008402874852000902958655001202967IND60552037720221118120410.0161019e201512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055203772DNAL7 a10.1016/j.molimm.2015.10.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPoitz, David M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7803-197210aEphrinB2/EphA4-mediated activation of endothelial cells increases monocyte adhesion  ap. 648-656.  aThe membrane anchored ligand ephrinB2 belongs to the broad Eph/ephrin system and is able to activate different Eph receptors. The Eph receptors belong to the huge group of receptor-tyrosine kinases. Eph receptors as well as their corresponding ephrin ligands are cell-membrane attached proteins. Therefore, direct cell‚Äìcell contact is essentially for interaction. It is known that ephrinB2 plays a pivotal role in developmental and in tumour angiogenesis.Previous studies point to a crucial role of the EphA4-receptor in the process of monocyte adhesion. Since ephrinB2 is known as an interaction partner of EphA4, the aim of the present study was to investigate a possible interplay of EphA4-receptor with ephrinB2 during monocyte adhesion to the endothelium. As verified by bulk adhesion assays and atomic-force microscopy based single-cell force spectroscopy, temporary stimulation of endothelial cells from different sources with the soluble ligand ephrinB2 increased monocyte adhesion to endothelial cells. The proadhesive effect of ephrinB2 was independent of an active transcription, but is mediated via the Rho signaling pathway with subsequent modulation of the actin cytoskeleton. Furthermore, ephrinB2 mediated its impact on monocyte adhesion via the receptor EphA4 as shown by siRNA-mediated silencing. Interestingly, ephrinB2 was induced by TNF-Œ± treatment. Silencing of ephrinB2 led to a lowering of the TNF-Œ± mediated monocyte adhesion to endothelial cells. Furthermore, immunohistochemical staining of human atherosclerotic plaque revealed expression of ephrinB2 in macrophages.The results of the present study point to a crucial role of ephrinB2 induced EphA4 forward signaling in the context of monocyte adhesion to endothelial cells. This transcription-independent effect is mediated by Rho signaling induced actin-filament polymerization.  aPublisher supplied data 3aatomic force microscopy 3acell adhesion 3aendothelial cells 3aendothelium 3ahumans 3aimmunohistochemistry 3aligands 3amicrofilaments 3amonocytes 3aneoplasms 3apolymerization 3aproteins 3areceptor protein-tyrosine kinase 3asignal transduction 3aspectroscopy 3astaining 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha 0aAtherosclerosis 0aMonocyte 0aEndothelial cells 0aAdhesion 0aTNF-Œ±1 aEnde, Georg1 aSt√ºtz, Beryl1 aAugstein, Antje1 aFriedrichs, Jens1 aBrunssen, Coy1 aWerner, C.q(Carsten),1 aStrasser, Ruth H.1 aJellinghaus, Stefanie0 tMolecular Immunology.g2015 Dec., v. 68 p.648-656dElsevier Ltdx0161-58907nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.molimm.2015.10.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02176naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245014500165300001800310520101500328592002801343650001701371650001201388650001101400650001901411650002101430650001301451650001801464650000901482650001101491650001001502700002101512700002101533700002201554700002101576773013601597856004801733852000901781655001201790IND50068073420221121021912.0140228e201309  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006807342DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-013-1639-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMaleva, Maria10aInfluence of exogenous urea on photosynthetic pigments, ¬π‚Å¥CO ‚ÇÇ uptake, and urease activity in Elodea densa‚Äîenvironmental implications  ap. 6172-6177.  aThis paper analyzes the effect of exogenous urea in increased concentration gradient (0, 100, 500 and 1,000 mg L) on photosynthetic pigments (measured spectrophotometrically), uptake of CO (using radioisotope), and urease activity (by measuring ammonia with Nessler's reagent) in leaves of Elodea densa Planch. We have observed that low concentration of urea (100 mg L) stimulates the accumulation of photosynthetic pigments and intensifies photosynthesis in E. densa, whereas high concentration (1,000 mg L) suppresses these processes. Urease activity increased by approximately 2.7 and 8 fold when exogenous urea concentrations were 100 and 500 mg L, respectively. However, exogenous urea in high concentration (1,000 mg L) decreased urease activity by 1.5 fold compared to the control. The necessity of mitigating urea and other nitrogen-containing compounds (NH from urea) in water bodies has been discussed with emphasis on the potential for phytoremediation of urea using common water weed viz. E. densa.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEgeria densa 3aammonia 3aleaves 3aphotosynthesis 3aphytoremediation 3apigments 3asurface water 3aurea 3aurease 3aweeds1 aBorisova, Galina1 aChukina, Nadezda1 aNekrasova, Galina1 aPrasad, M.

The validity of the genus Platyberyx is supported and its differences from the genus Caristius are described using characters that have not been applied before (e.g., dentation on the jaws and roof of the oral cavity). The redescription of the type species Platyberyx opalescens is given based on the material from the coastal zones of Morocco and Mauritania; the neotype of this species is established. Based on studied material and analysis of the literature data, a new species P. mauli sp. n. is described within the genus Platyberyx (together with P. opalescens). This species differs from P. opalescens in the structure of branchial apparatus, body proportions, and other characteristics. This species (as well as P. opalescens) belongs to the bathyal-pelagic ichthyocene of the continental slope of the East Atlantic. A new species, Caristius andriashevi sp. n., is described in the genus Caristius. Its specific characters are as follows: exclusively well-developed lateral line surrounded by spongy (most likely, lighting) tissue with enlarged perforated and densely packed scales located under the skin. The range of the species is wide tropical. A preliminary key for the identification of manefishes from the Atlantic Ocean is presented.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPerciformes 3ajaws 3alighting 3anew species 3aredescriptions 3aAtlantic Ocean 3aMauritania 3aMorocco1 aParin, N.

The development of urban production based on fossil fuels is the major contributor to the rise of greenhouse gas density, and to global warming. The concept of urban industrial structure optimization is considered to be a solution to urban sustainable development and global climate issues. Enforcing energy conservation and reducing carbon emissions are playing key roles in addressing these issues. As such, quantitative accounting and the evaluation of energy consumption and corresponding carbon emissions, which are by-products of urban production, are critical, in order to discover potential opportunities to save energy and to reduce emissions. Conventional evaluation indicators, such as ‚Äúenergy consumption per unit output value‚Äù and ‚Äúemissions per unit output value‚Äù, are concerned with immediate consumptions and emissions; while the indirect consumptions and emissions that occur throughout the supply chain are ignored. This does not support the optimization of the overall urban industrial system. To present a systematic evaluation framework for cities, this study constructs new evaluation indicators, based on the concepts of ‚Äúembodied energy‚Äù and ‚Äúembodied carbon emissions‚Äù, which take both the immediate and indirect effects of energy consumption and emissions into account. Taking Beijing as a case, conventional evaluation indicators are compared with the newly constructed ones. Results show that the energy consumption and emissions of urban industries are represented better by the new indicators than by conventional indicators, and provide useful information for urban industrial structure optimization.  aPublisher supplied data 3abyproducts 3acarbon 3acities 3aclimate 3aembodied energy 3aemissions 3aenergy conservation 3afossil fuels 3aglobal warming 3agreenhouse gases 3aindustrialization 3aindustry 3asupply chain 3asustainable development 3aurban development 3aChina1 aChen, Zhanming1 aLi, Jinkai0 tFrontiers of earth science.g2014 Mar., v. 8, no. 1 p.32-43dSpringer-Verlagx2095-01957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11707-013-0386-7  aDNAL 7aarticle03009naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002700145245012200172300001600294500001900310520151400329592002801843650002201871650002601893650001501919650001101934650001701945650001101962650001401973650001001987650002801997650001002025650001302035650001102048650001902059650002402078650001202102650001502114653003602129653002602165653002602191653002802217700001902245700002002264773014302284856007902427852000902506655001202515IND60706047420221122030604.0200807e201612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070604742DNAL7 a10.18805/asd.v36i4.64672doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTupkanloo, Zahra Noori10aWater demand management under alternative institutionnal arrangements (A case study of Coastal Lands of Yengejeh Dam)  ap. 277-281.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aIn the current situation one of the most important issues in environmental economics, management and optimal operation of its resources. Water demand management have been concerned by economic planners as a new approach in environmental economics. This study aims to investigate the management of water demand in different product markets in downstream lands of Yengejeh Dam in Neyshabur. This is an exploratory study in nature which was conducted through a questionnaire survey in 2015‚Äì2016. The population of this research is all farmers who use the water of Yengejeh dam to irrigate their lands. Using Cochran formula, 139 barley farmers selected as the sample of this research randomly. A scenario of increasing the elasticity of product demand in resource allocation in the competitive and monopolar water market was developed by assimilation algorithm in the studied region. According to the market situation of water in the region which is almost similar to monopoly water market, the results suggest that if farmers culture crops such as cotton, sunflower, cucumber, tomatoes, peas, red beans and cumin instead of barley that their prices were higher than the price of barley, amount of product produced per hectare of lands near water dam, create and supply costs per cubic meter of water, agricultural investment per meter of water flow to the farm, remaining amount of water per meter water channel, amount of water delivered to each hectare of land, opportunity rent per hectare of land reduced.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHelianthus annuus 3aagricultural sciences 3aalgorithms 3abarley 3acase studies 3acotton 3acucumbers 3acumin 3aenvironmental economics 3afarms 3amonopoly 3aprices 3aquestionnaires 3aresource allocation 3asurveys 3awater flow 0aCompetitive water market system 0aExport-oriented crops 0aMonopoly water market 0aWater demand management1 aYazdani, Saeed1 aMoghadasi, Reza0 tAgricultural science digest.g2016 Dec., v. 36, no. 4 p.277-281dAgricultural Research Communication CentrewJournal:2003x0976-05477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.18805/asd.v36i4.64673Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03417naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001500150245010300165300001600268520210100284592002802385650001302413650001202426650001502438650001302453650001202466650002702478650001302505650002102518650001502539651001602554651002102570653001202591653002002603653001902623653001602642653001602658700001802674700001902692700001802711773014802729856008502877852000902962655001202971IND60585757020221123011946.0180911e20180115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058575702DNAL7 a10.1016/j.palaeo.2017.11.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAksu, A.E.10aOrganized patches of bioherm growth where the Strait of Dardanelles enters the Marmara Sea, Turkey  ap. 325-346.  aHigh-resolution multibeam mosaics show that the seafloor across the southwestern Marmara Sea is host to remarkably organized near-circular bioherm mounds, which commonly are arranged into large, tightly packed clusters. Grab samples and gravity cores reveal that the bioherms are predominantly composed of very fine-grained, calcareous, silty mud with abundant bioclasts, including centimetre-scale masses of coralline red algae and intact disarticulated mollusc shells (mainly the genera Modiolus and Mytilus). Geometric analysis of multibeam images reveals that the average bioherm is 15.6m in diameter, occupies ~190m¬≤ of seabed, stands 113cm above the adjacent seafloor, and its crest is 20.6m from the crests of neighbouring bioherms. In regions of tightly packed bioherm clusters (referred to as ‚Äòbioherm colonies‚Äô) the inter-mound depressions are on average 4.4m wide and 33cm deep. Although each bioherm mound is nearly circular, the surrounding inter-mound channels form a more rectilinear mesh of linked pentagonal and hexagonal polygons suggesting densest possible spatial packing of the mounds. Near-neighbour statistics of R=2.11‚Äì2.14 indicate an essentially uniform spacing between the bioherms, which is the expected result for close packing on a plane and full utilization of the available space.The bioherms occur at depths between ‚àí30m and ‚àí60m. They are absent above and below these depths. In this part of the southwestern Marmara Sea at the eastern exit of the Strait of Dardanelles, water depth controls important water mass properties such as salinity, nutrient supply and availability of light. Other inferred critical controls are the availability of a suitable hard substrate where Holocene muds are thin or absent, and nutrient supply, potentially including a component from escaping methane-rich pore fluids. Evidence here and elsewhere in the Marmara Sea provisionally dates the onset of bioherm growth and development to the latest Pleistocene‚Äìearliest Holocene, after global sealevel rose to the breach depth of the Strait of Dardanelles at ~13.8calka.  aPublisher supplied data 3aModiolus 3aMytilus 3aRhodophyta 3ageometry 3agravity 3agrowth and development 3asalinity 3ashell (molluscs) 3astatistics 3aMarmara Sea 3aTurkey (country) 0aBioherm 0aCoralline algae 0aChemosynthesis 0aMarmara Sea 0aDardanelles1 aHiscott, R.N.1 aKostylev, V.E.1 aYaltƒ±rak, C.0 tPalaeogeography, palaeoclimatology, palaeoecology.g2018 Jan. 15, v. 490 p.325-346dElsevier B.V.aElsevier B.V.wJournal:2694x0031-01827nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.palaeo.2017.11.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02514naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002400148245009900172300001400271520108200285592002801367650002701395650002501422650001901447650001801466650001401484650003801498650001401536650001301550650001401563650001801577650000901595650001301604650001201617650001201629651001001641653002601651653001901677653001101696653002501707700001701732700001801749700002401767700002101791773011601812856008301928852000902011655001202020IND60569155720221118130802.0190405e201706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056915572DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aoas.2017.05.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSikirou, Rachidatou10aDistribution, pathological and biochemical characterization of Ralstonia solanacearum in Benin  ap. 83-88.  aIn 2006 and 2007, 75 strains of Ralstonia solanacearum were collected from wilting tomato, pepper and eggplant in Benin. The distribution and the incidence of tomato bacterial wilt in the field were assessed by counting wilted tomato plants on 3 plots of 50m2 per field. The isolated bacterial strains, including the reference strain, were identified using ELISA, pathogenicity test and carbohydrate oxidation. Bacterial wilt is widely distributed in Benin and was found in five of the eight agro-ecological zones (AEZ) of Benin, which correspond to eight of the 12 districts of Benin. The disease was more severe in ferralitic soil (AEZ V), in valleys and lowlands (AEZ IV) and in highlands (AEZ I). The incidence of tomato bacterial wilt was up to 71%. No R. solanacearum strains were isolated from AEZ II, AEZ VII and AEZ VIII. Strains identified as R. solanacearum were more widely distributed in the south than the center and the north of Benin. Based on biochemical characteristics, Beninese R. solanacearum strains were grouped into biovar I/race1 and biovar III/race 1.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRalstonia solanacearum 3aagroecological zones 3abacterial wilt 3acarbohydrates 3aeggplants 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3ahighlands 3alowlands 3aoxidation 3apathogenicity 3asoil 3atomatoes 3avalleys 3awilting 3aBenin 0aAgro-ecological zones 0aBacterial wilt 0aBiovar 0aSolanum lycopersicon1 aBeed, Fenton1 aEzin, Vincent1 aHoteigni, Josephine1 aMiller, Sally A.0 tAnnals of agricultural science.g2017 June, v. 62, no. 1 p.83-88dElsevier B.V.wJournal:17770x0570-17837nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aoas.2017.05.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01852naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245011900167300001600286520046300302592002800765650001500793650003400808650003100842650001700873650001300890650001700903650004400920650001900964653002500983653002701008700001501035700001401050700001501064700001601079700001901095700001601114700002001130700002001150700001801170773012401188856008501312852000901397655001201406IND60679764820221123030713.0191231e201912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067976482DNAL7 a10.1016/S1875-5364(19)30118-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Yuan,10aClerodane diterpenoids with potential anti-inflammatory activity from the leaves and twigs of Callicarpa cathayana  ap. 953-962.  aPhytochemical investigation of the leaves and twigs of Callicarpa cathayana led to the isolation of six new clerodane diterpenoids, cathayanalactones A‚ÄìF (1‚Äì6), together with seven analogues (7‚Äì13).

This paper first analyzes influences (such as economic growth, inflation, and technology) that generate disequilibrium and low returns. But the major issue analyzed is why farm disequilibrium persists after an extended period of full national employment, a strong national economy, an expansion of the aggregate farm plant, and a slow growth of farm productivity in the 1960's. The fixed resource theory, the increasing returns to size theory, and the imperfect competition theory are examined to explain persistence and permanency of disequilibrium and low returns. The fixed resource theory explains low returns as a labor fixity problem and suggests that the problem is either nonexistent or temporary. The increasing returns to size theory points to an extended duration for the low returns problem as long as the large majority of farms continue to operate on uneconomic size units. Finally, the imperfect competition theory depicts low returns as virtually permanent, given the economic structures of the farm and nonfarm sectors.  aPublisher supplied data 3acommodity programs 3aeconomic development 3aeconomic structure 3aemployment 3afarms 3aimperfect competition 3ainflation 3alabor 3aopportunity costs0 tAmerican journal of agricultural economics.g1969 Nov., v. 51, no. 4 p.798-817dOxford University PresswJournal:jnl44932x0002-90927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2307/12377753Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02771naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002400149245013200173300001600305520133000321592002801651650001001679650002001689650001001709650001101719650001101730650001201741650001101753650002101764650001701785650001801802650002001820650001001840651001601850651001601866653001901882653001701901653001801918653002401936653002101960653001701981653001401998700002002012700001902032773013402051856008302185852000902268655001202277IND60601180220221121030746.0180706e201409  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060118022DNAL7 a10.1016/j.yqres.2014.05.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aScherler, Laureline10aCarbon and oxygen stable isotope compositions of late Pleistocene mammal teeth from dolines of Ajoie (Northwestern Switzerland)  ap. 378-387.  aFossils of megaherbivores from eight late Pleistocene ¬π‚Å¥C- and OSL-dated doline infillings of Ajoie (NW Switzerland) were discovered along the Transjurane highway in the Swiss Jura. Carbon and oxygen analyses of enamel were performed on forty-six teeth of large mammals (Equus germanicus, Mammuthus primigenius, Coelodonta antiquitatis, and Bison priscus), coming from one doline in Boncourt (~80ka, marine oxygen isotope stage MIS5a) and seven in Courtedoux (51‚Äì27ka, late MIS3), in order to reconstruct the paleoclimatic and paleoenvironmental conditions of the region. Similar enamel Œ¥¬π¬≥C values for both periods, ranging from ‚àí14.5 to ‚àí9.2‚Ä∞, indicate that the megaherbivores lived in a C3 plant-dominated environment. Enamel Œ¥¬π‚Å∏OPO4 values range from 10.9 to 16.3‚Ä∞ with a mean of 13.5¬±1.0‚Ä∞ (n=46). Mean air temperatures (MATs) were inferred using species-specific Œ¥¬π‚Å∏OPO4‚ÄìŒ¥¬π‚Å∏OH2O-calibrations for modern mammals and a present-day precipitation Œ¥¬π‚Å∏OH2O-MAT relation for Switzerland. Similar average MATs of 6.6¬±3.6¬∞C for the deposits dated to ~80ka and 6.5¬±3.3¬∞C for those dated to the interval 51‚Äì27ka were estimated. This suggests that these mammals in the Ajoie area lived in mild periods of the late Pleistocene with MATs only about 2.5¬∞C lower than modern-day temperatures.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEquus 3aair temperature 3abison 3acarbon 3aenamel 3afossils 3aoxygen 3apaleoclimatology 3apaleoecology 3aradionuclides 3astable isotopes 3ateeth 3aAlps region 3aSwitzerland 0aMegaherbivores 0aTooth enamel 0aEarly Glacial 0aMiddle Pleniglacial 0aPaleoenvironment 0aPaleoclimate 0aPaleodiet1 aT√ºtken, Thomas1 aBecker, Damien0 tQuaternary research.g2014 Sept., v. 82, no. 2 p.378-387dElsevier Inc.aUniversity of WashingtonwJournal:12398x0033-58947nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.yqres.2014.05.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03046naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005600148245007400204300001600278500001900294520196000313592002802273650001302301650001102314650001402325650001802339650000902357650001602366650001702382650001702399650001902416650001602435650001502451773012602466856008302592852000902675655001202684IND60715638920221119220528.0201129e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071563892DNAL7 a10.1007/s10546-020-00560-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrunet, Yves1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3313-523010aTurbulent Flow in Plant Canopies: Historical Perspective and Overview  ap. 315-364.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aStudying the microclimate of plant canopies has long motivated scientists in various research fields such as agronomy, ecology or silviculture, and almost a century has passed since the first measurements of wind speed in a forest stand were published in the scientific literature. The behaviour of wind in canopies is an essential component of their microclimate, which largely conditions the rate of exchange of heat, water vapour, and other gases and particles of interest with the atmosphere. This review examines the evolution of our understanding of turbulent flow in plant canopies, focussing on the period that covers the last fifty years (1970‚Äì2020). We first describe how our knowledge and ideas have evolved since canopy flow became a topic of interest, and show how the 1970s was a pivotal decade in this field. Until then, canopy turbulence was considered to result from the superposition of standard surface-layer turbulence and small-scale turbulence generated in the wakes of plant elements. However, it was progressively found that the flow in plant canopies is dominated by large coherent structures, giving canopy turbulence unique characteristics. We thus describe the particular nature and structure of canopy flows, based on experimental observations accumulated over several decades. We show how canopy turbulence was reconsidered on the basis of a now widely-accepted analogy with a plane mixing layer, and we examine the significance of a key parameter, the ‚Äúcanopy-shear length scale‚Äù. Investigating the effects of canopy density and atmospheric stability, we then discuss the extent of the mixing-layer analogy and the limits of our current understanding of canopy turbulence. Finally, we review the modelling tools used in this field and show how their development has evolved to date to meet our needs. In conclusion, we present a historical summary of the evolution of this research field and suggest future directions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagronomy 3acanopy 3aevolution 3aforest stands 3aheat 3ameteorology 3amicroclimate 3asilviculture 3aturbulent flow 3awater vapor 3awind speed0 tBoundary-layer meteorology.g2020 Dec., v. 177, no. 2-3 p.315-364dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl9360x0006-83147nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10546-020-00560-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03540naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002100139245012700160300001600287500002000303520169100323592002802014596003902042596005202081596004802133596001502181650001902196650000802215650002202223650001102245650003102256650002802287650001402315650002002329650001202349650001402361650001902375650001702394650001402411700002202425700002602447700001902473700002602492700002402518700002002542700002902562700005902591700002302650700002302673700007102696773012402767856007402891852000902965655001202974IND60773196420221119031501.0220412e202205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077319642DNAL7 a10.1111/mpp.131942doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXiang Neik, Ting10aTwo independent approaches converge to the cloning of a new Leptosphaeria maculans avirulence effector gene, AvrLmS‚ÄêLep2  ap. 733-748.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aBrassica napus (oilseed rape, canola) seedling resistance to Leptosphaeria maculans, the causal agent of blackleg (stem canker) disease, follows a gene‚Äêfor‚Äêgene relationship. The avirulence genes AvrLmS and AvrLep2 were described to be perceived by the resistance genes RlmS and LepR2, respectively, present in B.¬†napus ‚ÄòSurpass 400‚Äô. Here we report cloning of AvrLmS and AvrLep2 using two independent methods. AvrLmS was cloned using combined in vitro crossing between avirulent and virulent isolates with sequencing of DNA bulks from avirulent or virulent progeny (bulked segregant sequencing). AvrLep2 was cloned using a biparental cross of avirulent and virulent L.¬†maculans isolates and a classical map‚Äêbased cloning approach. Taking these two approaches independently, we found that AvrLmS and AvrLep2 are the same gene. Complementation of virulent isolates with this gene confirmed its role in inducing resistance on Surpass 400, Topas‚ÄêLepR2, and an RlmS‚Äêline. The gene, renamed AvrLmS‚ÄêLep2, encodes a small cysteine‚Äêrich protein of unknown function with an N‚Äêterminal secretory signal peptide, which is a common feature of the majority of effectors from extracellular fungal plant pathogens. The AvrLmS‚ÄêLep2/LepR2 interaction phenotype was found to vary from a typical hypersensitive response through intermediate resistance sometimes towards susceptibility, depending on the inoculation conditions. AvrLmS‚ÄêLep2 was nevertheless sufficient to significantly slow the systemic growth of the pathogen and reduce the stem lesion size on plant genotypes with LepR2, indicating the potential efficiency of this resistance to control the disease in the field.  aPublisher supplied data  cGrowing Forward 2 research Program  aGPLA07‚Äê024CcAgence Nationale de la Recherche  cGrains Research and Development Corporation  cSaskCanola 3aBrassica napus 3aDNA 3aPlenodomus lingam 3acanola 3agene-for-gene relationship 3ahypersensitive response 3aphenotype 3aplant pathology 3aprogeny 3aseedlings 3asignal peptide 3astem cankers 3avirulence1 aGhanbarnia, Kaveh1 aOllivier, B√©n√©dicte1 aScheben, Armin1 aSevern‚ÄêEllis, Anita1 aLarkan, Nicholas J.1 aHaddadi, Parham1 aFernando, Dilantha W.

The preparation and application of boronate affinity materials has attracted much attention in recent years. In this work, a high-capacity boronate affinity adsorbent was prepared by surface-initiated reversible addition‚Äìfragmentation chain transfer polymerization (SI-RAFT). Commercial aminated poly(glycidyl methacrylate) (PGMA) microspheres were modified with the chain transfer agent (CTA) S-1-dodecyl-S-(Œ±,Œ±-dimethyl-Œ±-acetic acid)trithiocarbonate (DDATC). Boronate-affinity adsorbents were then prepared via SI-RAFT polymerization employing 3-acrylamidophenylboronic acid (AAPBA) as the monomer. The Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), nitrogen adsorption and desorption measurements have proven the successful grafting of AAPBA on PGMA microspheres surface. The boronate affinity adsorbents thus prepared possess much higher adsorption capacity (99.2¬†¬µmol/g of adenosine) and both faster adsorption and desorption speed towards ribonucleosides, the adsorption and desorption could be completed in 2¬†min. The high selectivity of the adsorbents to ribonucleosides was verified in the presence of a large excess of deoxynucleosides. The boronate affinity adsorbents were then employed for sample pretreatment before HPLC analysis of ribonucleosides in serum. The ribonucleosides were effectively enriched by boronate affinity dispersive solid-phase extraction (BA-DSPE), with high mass recoveries and good precision. The simultaneous determination of uridine and guanosine in calf serum was achieved by utilizing the standard addition method, their contents were determined to be 170¬†¬±¬†11.6¬†ng/mL and 39.6¬†¬±¬†4.4¬†ng/mL respectively. The results proved that the prepared boronate affinity materials could be applied for sample pretreatment of cis-diol containing molecules in biological samples.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aadenosine 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3aanalytical chemistry 3ablood serum 3acalves 3adesorption 3aguanosine 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3anitrogen 3apolymerization 3asolid phase extraction 3auridine 0aBoronate affinity adsorbents 0aHigh capacity 0aReversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer polymerization 0aEnrichment 0aRibonucleosides1 aXu, Huanhuan1 aWei, Yinmao0 tAnalytica chimica acta.g2016 Jan. 01, v. 902 p.115-122dElsevier B.V.x0003-26707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aca.2015.11.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02910naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245011200168300001600280520119400296592002801490650002501518650001301543650001901556650001301575650001801588650001501606650003701621650001901658650002001677650003201697653000801729653000801737653000801745653000801753653000801761653000901769653000901778653000801787653000801795653000901803653001101812653001001823653001201833653002501845653001301870653002901883653002601912653002301938700005701961700005302018700001402071700001902085700001402104773008502118856008402203852000902287655001202296IND60552038020221118145610.0161019e201512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055203802DNAL7 a10.1016/j.molimm.2015.10.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDong, Yu-Qing10aToll-like receptor 4 signaling promotes invasion of hepatocellular carcinoma cells through MKK4/JNK pathway  ap. 671-683.  aToll-like receptor (TLR) 4-mediated signaling has been shown to be important to cell survival, invasion and metastasis in a variety of cancers. The present study aimed to explore the role and downstream pathways of TLR4 signaling in the invasion of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cell lines. We found that LPS, the agonist of TLR4, notably enhanced the invasiveness of HCC cells and the expression of MMP2 and MMP9, as well as the production of IL-6 and TNFŒ±. LPS treatment dramatically increased the TLR4 expression on HCC cells surface and MKK4/JNK activation, while knockdown of TLR4 inhibited the LPS-induced invasion and the phosphorylation of MKK4 and JNK. Furthermore, silencing of MKK4 or inhibition of JNK activity led to impaired invasiveness of HCCs, low expression level of MMPs and TLR4, as well as limited production of cytokines. However, LPS stimulation only triggered moderate activation of NF-–∫B. Silencing of NF-–∫B or NF-–∫B inhibitor had no obvious effect on the invasive ability of HCCs and TLR4 expression, but suppressed IL-6 and TNFŒ± production. These findings suggested that LPS-TLR4 signaling enhanced the invasiveness of HCCs mainly through MKK4/JNK pathway.  aPublisher supplied data 3aToll-like receptor 4 3aagonists 3acell viability 3ahepatoma 3ainterleukin-6 3ametastasis 3amitogen-activated protein kinase 3aneoplasm cells 3aphosphorylation 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha 0aTLR 0aLPS 0aHCC 0aEMT 0aMMP 0aMAPK 0aMKK4 0aJNK 0aERK 0aIŒ∫B 0aNF-–∫B 0asiRNA 0aqRT-PCR 0aToll-like receptor 4 0aInvasion 0aHepatocellular carcinoma 0aJun N-terminal kinase 0aLipopolysaccharide1 aLu, Chuan-Wei1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7124-56361 aZhang, Lu1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8276-26041 aYang, Jia1 aHameed, Waqaar1 aChen, Wei0 tMolecular Immunology.g2015 Dec., v. 68 p.671-683dElsevier Ltdx0161-58907nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.molimm.2015.10.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03383naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245011300168520226600281592002802547650002102575650002302596650001102619650002602630650001502656650001202671650001002683650002402693650001302717650001302730650001902743650001002762700002102772773013402793856008502927852000903012655001203021IND60672774320221121055924.0191017e20190613xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067277432DNAL7 a10.1093/cdn/nzz039.FS10-07-192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCory, Hannah10aAssociations of Exposure to Weight Talk, Unhealthy Weight Control and Overeating in Early Teens (FS10-07-19)  aExamine the association between exposure to weight talk from same and opposite gender peers and overeating and unhealthy weight control (UWC) amongst racially/ethnically-diverse youth aged 11‚Äì16 using cross-sectional, observational data. Hypothesis 1: Increased exposure to weight talk from same and opposite gender peers will be associated with both overeating and UWC behaviors with variation in magnitude of relationship based on social source. In Project Viva, 1023 early teens (ages 11‚Äì16) reported experiences of weight talk from multiple social sources (parents, siblings, same & different gender peers and teachers/coaches). The main exposure was weight talk, functioning as a proxy for a weight-centric environment, coded as low weight talk or high weight talk. At the same timepoint teens reported disordered eating (overeating and UWC behaviors). Ordinal logistic regression assessed the associations of weight talk with both disordered eating behaviors, controlling for known confounders. Preliminary results show that the odds of those exposed to high weight talk from peers of the same gender engaging in overeating or UWC behavior was 1.32 and 1.89 (95% CI,1.22 to 1.43; 95% CI, 1.06 to 3.37) times that of those exposed to low weight talk, both statistically significant effects, P¬†<¬†0.001, P¬†=¬†0.031. The odds of those exposed to high weight talk from opposite gender peers engaging in overeating was 2.43 (95% CI, 1.14 to 5.22) times that of those exposed to low weight talk, a statistically significant effect, P¬†=¬†0.115. The odds of those exposed to high weight talk from opposite gender peers engaging in UWC behaviors was 1.69 (95% CI, 0.88 to 3.25) times that of those exposed to low weight talk, a non-statistically significant effect, P¬†=¬†0.115. High weight talk from peers of the same gender is significantly associated with higher odds of both overeating UWC behaviors in early teens. However, high weight talk from peers of the opposite gender is only significantly associated with higher odds of overeating.

A common approach to improving matrix effects is to purify pesticides through the use of sorbents, but this requires a combination of multiple sorbents and extensive use. Zeolitic imidazolate framework‚Äê8 is widely used for pesticide analysis due to its high porosity, large specific surface area, and versatility. Here, we established and validated a modified quick, easy, cheap, effective, rugged, and safe method based on a zeolitic imidazolate framework‚Äê8 that was used to test the removal ability for polyphenols. To this end, 145 pesticide residues in peppermint, perilla, fennel, and mulberry leaves were analyzed by the modified method coupled with liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry. The mean recoveries of all pesticide residues were in the range of 74.3‚Äì103.7%, with mean relative standard deviations ‚â§9.1% at spiked concentrations of 1, 10, 50, and 100¬†Œºg/kg for mulberry leaves. The limits of quantitation of the method ranged from 1 to 50¬†Œºg/kg. This study offers a reliable approach for the accurate quantitative analysis of various trace substances in the polyphenol‚Äêrich plants.  aPublisher supplied data  a2020C02023cKey Research and Development Program of Zhejiang Province  a2021PRG006cKey Laboratory of Detection for Pesticide Residues and Control of Zhejiang Province  a2017YFC1601600cthe National Key Research and Development Program of China  a2010DS700124‚ÄêKF1905cState Key Laboratory for Quality and Safety of Agro‚Äêproducts  a2010DS700124‚ÄêZZ2009cState Key Laboratory for Quality and Safety of Agro‚Äêproducts 3aMentha piperita nothosubsp. piperita 3afennel 3aliquid chromatography 3amulberries 3apesticides 3apolyphenols 3aporosity 3aquantitative analysis 3aseparation 3asolid phase extraction 3asorbents 3asurface area 3atandem mass spectrometry1 aQi, Peipei1 aWang, Jiao1 aDi, Shanshan1 aWang, Zhiwei1 aXu, Hao1 aZhao, Huiyu1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0230-84741 aWang, Qiang1 aWang, Xinquan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3987-20201 aZhang, Chenghui1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4488-86680 tJournal of separation science.g2022 Apr., v. 45, no. 7 p.1326-1335dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3924049x1615-93067nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jssc.2021008143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02930naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100005500142245012900197300002000326520180900346592002802155650002802183650001102211650002302222650001902245650001702264700001802281700002202299700006002321773014902381856007702530852000902607655001202616IND60759333020221117222921.0211208e20211117xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075933302DNAL7 a10.1021/jacs.1c077252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Jingbai1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4743-031810aMachine-Learning Photodynamics Simulations Uncover the Role of Substituent Effects on the Photochemical Formation of Cubanes  ap. 20166-20175.  aPhotochemical [2 + 2]-cycloadditions store solar energy in chemical bonds and efficiently access strained organic molecular architectures. Functionalized [3]-ladderdienes undergo [2 + 2]-photocycloadditions to afford cubanes, a class of strained organic molecules. The substituents (e.g., methyl, trifluoromethyl, and cyclopropyl) affect the overall reactivities of these cubane precursors; the yields range from 1 to 48%. However, the origin of these substituent effects on the reactivities and chemoselectivities is not understood. We now integrate single and multireference calculations and machine-learning-accelerated nonadiabatic molecular dynamics (ML-NAMD) to understand how substituents affect the ultrafast dynamics and mechanism of [2 + 2]-photocycloadditions. Steric clashes between substituent groups destabilize the 4œÄ-electrocyclic ring-opening pathway and minimum energy conical intersections by 0.72‚Äì1.15 eV and reaction energies by 0.68‚Äì2.34 eV. Noncovalent dispersive interactions stabilize the [2 + 2]-photocycloaddition pathway; the conical intersection energies are lower by 0.31‚Äì0.85 eV, and the reaction energies are lower by 0.03‚Äì0.82 eV. The 2 ps ML-NAMD trajectories reveal that closed-shell repulsions block a 6œÄ-conrotatory electrocyclic ring-opening pathway with increasing steric bulk. Thirty-eight percent of the methyl-substituted [3]-ladderdiene trajectories proceed through the 6œÄ-conrotatory electrocyclic ring-opening, whereas the trifluoromethyl- and cyclopropyl-substituted [3]-ladderdienes prefer the [2 + 2]-photocycloaddition pathways. The predicted cubane yields (H: 0.4% < CH‚ÇÉ: 1% < CF‚ÇÉ: 14% < cPr: 15%) match the experimental trend; these substituents predistort the reactants to resemble the conical intersection geometries leading to cubanes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aartificial intelligence 3aenergy 3amolecular dynamics 3aphotochemistry 3asolar energy1 aStein, Rachel1 aAdrion, Daniel M.1 aLopez, Steven A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8418-36380 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2021 Nov. 17, v. 143, no. 48 p.20166-20175dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19166x1520-51267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jacs.1c077253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02489naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245010900165300001500274520103200289592002801321650001801349650001401367650001401381650001901395650002201414650002101436650002601457650001201483650001801495650001301513653000801526653000901534653001401543653001801557653001401575653001401589653001301603653001001616653001101626700002501637700002201662700002201684700001901706700001701725700002001742773011701762856008301879852000901962655001201971IND60569155920221118130819.0190405e201706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056915592DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aoas.2017.05.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKone, Nahoua10aInfluence of planting date on incidence and severity of viral disease on cucurbits under field condition  ap. 99-104.  aThree field experiments were conducted to assess the effect of planting date on the incidence of viral diseases and the severity and the susceptibility of the cultivars. Two cultivars of cucumber (Hybrid Tokyo F1 and Poinsett) and one local variety of zucchini (Bolle) were used for the evaluation in May-July 2014, September-November 2014, and February-April 2015. A randomized complete block design with three replications was used for the experiments. Data were collected on disease incidence, severity, and time until first symptoms occurred. Area under severity index progress curve (AUSIPC) and area under disease progress curve (AUDPC) were calculated respectively for disease severity as well as the incidence on each cultivar. The results demonstrate the susceptibility of all cultivars to the tested viral diseases. The effect of planting dates on cultivars was significantly different (P<0.05) at the different growing stages whereas there was no significant difference (P>0.05) in planting date-variety interaction.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCucurbitaceae 3acucumbers 3acultivars 3adisease course 3adisease incidence 3adisease severity 3afield experimentation 3ahybrids 3aplanting date 3azucchini 0aCMV 0aZYMV 0aCucurbits 0aPlanting date 0aCultivars 0aIncidence 0aSeverity 0aAUDPC 0aAUSIPC1 aAsare-Bediako, Elvis1 aSilue, Souleymane1 aDaouda, Tou Kone,1 aKoita, Ousmane1 aMenzel, Wulf1 aWinter, Stephan0 tAnnals of agricultural science.g2017 June, v. 62, no. 1 p.99-104dElsevier B.V.wJournal:17770x0570-17837nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aoas.2017.05.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03049naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002200151245010800173520196400281592002802245650002802273650002102301650002102322650001902343650001702362650002202379650000802401650001802409650001902427650001002446700002702456773013402483856008502617852000902702655001202711IND60672774420221121035404.0191017e20190613xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067277442DNAL7 a10.1093/cdn/nzz039.FS10-08-192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMcDermott, Connor10aPerceived Weight Status Among College Students and Its Relationship with Life Satisfaction (FS10-08-19)  aAs mistaken body weight perceptions have been linked to less healthy diet and activity behaviors, accurate weight perception may help individuals set appropriate, health-related weight goals. However, some data link poor weight perception with negative mental health. The purpose of this study is to examine the prevalence of body weight misperception and self-reported life satisfaction among undergraduate college students. Data were collected from undergraduate students (18‚Äì24 years) participating in an on-going cross-sectional health survey at a midsize, northeastern university between 2010‚Äì18 (n¬†=¬†3921). Students self-reported their described weight status and life satisfaction via online questionnaire; body composition was assessed via bioelectrical impedance in a fasted state. Proportional differences between men and women were evaluated using chi-square analyses. More than a third (35.9%) of students misperceived their weight status. Among men (n¬†=¬†1190), 31.7% misperceived their weight status. Among women (n¬†=¬†2731), 37.6% misperceived their weight status. Compared with men, women had a higher prevalence of overestimating their weight status (31.7 vs. 11.1%, P¬†<¬†0.01). Compared with women, men had a higher prevalence of underestimating weight status (20.7 vs. 5.9%, P¬†<¬†0.01). No significant differences in life satisfaction were observed among individuals who correctly perceive their weight status versus those who misperceived. Our results show a high prevalence of undergraduate college students who misperceive their weight status; however, misperception was not associated with differences in life satisfaction. As misperception of weight status differed between genders, targeted interventions related to the promotion of healthy weight may consider sex-specific messaging in college students.

XUV absorption between 44 and 58 eV measures transitions from the I 4d core to the valence and conduction bands and gives distinct signals for hole and electron dynamics. The core-to-valence-band signal directly maps the photoexcited hole distribution and provides a quantitative measurement of the hole temperature. The combination of XUV and optical probes reveals that upon excitation at 400 nm, the initial hole distribution is 3.5 times hotter than the electron distribution. At an initial carrier density of 1.4 √ó 10¬≤‚Å∞ cm‚Äì¬≥ both carriers are subject to a hot phonon bottleneck, but at 4.2 √ó 10¬π‚Åπ cm‚Äì¬≥ the holes cool to less than 1000 K within 400 fs. This result places significant constraints on the use of organohalide perovskites in hot-carrier photovoltaics.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3aquantitative analysis 3asemiconductors 3asolar energy 3aspectroscopy 3atemperature1 aLeveillee, Joshua1 aSharma, Aastha1 aLin, Ming-Fu1 aSchleife, Andr√©,1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0496-82141 aVura-Weis, Josh1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7734-31300 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2021 Nov. 23, v. 143, no. 48 p.20176-20182dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19166x1520-51267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jacs.1c078173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03697naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245009400167300001600261500001900277520235200296592002802648650001702676650001902693650002002712650002202732650002502754650001102779650001802790650002102808650001602829650001302845650001802858650002602876650001402902650002102916650002302937650001702960651001402977651001102991700001903002773012603021856008303147852000903230655001203239IND60715639120221119220640.0201129e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071563912DNAL7 a10.1007/s10546-020-00526-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGarratt, J. R.10aRetrospective Analysis of Micrometeorological Observations Above an Australian Wheat Crop  ap. 613-641.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aWe apply well-established flux‚Äìgradient relationships to deduce the aerodynamic and radiative properties of a winter wheat crop, using a neglected 1971 dataset (hourly averages), only recently resurrected as part of a historical review of precision CO‚ÇÇ measurements in Australia (Pearman et al. in Hist Rec Aust Sci 28:111‚Äì125, 2017). The aerodynamic roughness length (seasonal variation between 0.07 and 0.14 of the mean crop height) and broadband albedo (seasonal variation between 0.13 and 0.23) are consistent with values published in the literature over the past 50¬†years. Net radiation at night is found to agree with the net longwave flux only when the dry-bulb temperature exceeds 10¬†¬∞C, probably the result of dewfall on one or both of the two instruments. During the day, the sum of the four individual radiative flux components (upwards and downwards shortwave and longwave)‚Äîthe composite net radiation‚Äîexceeds the directly measured net radiation, from near zero at sunrise to approximately 100¬†W¬†m‚Åª¬≤ at maximum net radiation‚Äâ‚âà‚Äâ600¬†W¬†m‚Åª¬≤, viz. an underestimate in the directly measured net radiation of close to 15%. Again, this is in line with instrument comparisons made in the USA and Europe 15‚Äì25¬†years ago. A novel approach is used in the analysis of terms in the surface energy budget, viz., normalization of all terms by the downwelling shortwave flux. Normalization reveals, (1) near-normal frequency distributions of both the total turbulent heat flux (sensible plus latent) and the implied total storage (the residual); (2) significant diurnal variations in the total turbulent heat flux, whose standard deviations of individual values about any hourly mean during daytime are reduced significantly on those for either the sensible or latent heat flux; (3) an implied storage term with a well-defined diurnal variation, but with an overall mean value of 1% of the shortwave input. Overall, with the above results in mind, the computed momentum and heat fluxes (and also the CO‚ÇÇ flux) during the daytime, at small to moderate gradient Richardson numbers, provide support for the profile approach when eddy-correlation fluxes are unavailable. Even so, possible errors due to, (1) uncertainties in the zero-plane displacement, and (2) influences of the roughness sublayer, must be borne in mind.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaerodynamics 3acarbon dioxide 3adata collection 3adiurnal variation 3adry-bulb temperature 3aenergy 3aheat transfer 3alatent heat flux 3ameteorology 3amomentum 3anet radiation 3aretrospective studies 3aroughness 3aroughness length 3aseasonal variation 3awinter wheat 3aAustralia 3aEurope1 aPearman, G.

Samples were measured for aflatoxin M1 (AFM1) concentrations using the enzyme immunoassay method. Elevated levels (>50¬†ng/kg) of AFM1 were analysed by validated liquid chromatography with triple quadruple mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). The limits of detection (LOD) and quantification (LOQ) of the LC-MS/MS method were 7.3 and 28¬†ng/kg, respectively. The mean AFM1 levels measured in the three regions over four seasons were in the ranges (ng/kg): eastern Croatia 7.25‚Äì26.6; western Croatia 5.91‚Äì9.26; other regions of Croatia 7.17‚Äì13.6. The highest incidence of samples exceeding the EU MRL (50¬†ng/kg) of 9.32% was measured in autumn (October‚ÄìDecember) in the eastern region. Only eight samples were found to exceed the EU MRL in winter. The highest AFM1 levels were measured in December (764.4¬†ng/kg) and January (383.3¬†ng/kg). Elevated AFM1 levels were found in summer in only four samples from the western and other regions, and two samples in the eastern region. This can be attributed to localized and random usage of contaminated feed for dairy cows in those regions. The much lower incidence of elevated AFM1 in comparison to a previous study showed that the outbreak of the crisis due to elevated AFM1 levels in 2013 resulted in a more careful approach to the control of supplementary feedstuff for lactating cows.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEuropean Union 3aaflatoxin M1 3aautumn 3adairy cows 3adetection limit 3aenzyme immunoassays 3afeed contamination 3afeeds 3alactation 3aliquid chromatography 3amass spectrometry 3amaximum residue limits 3amonitoring 3araw milk 3asummer 3awinter 3aCroatia 0aAflatoxin M1 0aCow milk 0aELISA 0aLC-MS/MS 0aCroatian regions1 aVarenina, Ivana1 aKolanoviƒá, Bo≈æica Solomun1 aBo≈æiƒá, ƒêurƒëica1 aƒêokiƒá, Maja1 aSedak, Marija1 aTankoviƒá, Sanin1 aPotoƒçnjak, Dalibor1 aCvetniƒá, ≈Ωeljko,0 tFood control.g2015 Aug., v. 54 p.331-337dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl56242x0956-71357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodcont.2015.02.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02535naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001900149245013300168300001600301520101800317592002801335650001301363650001301376650002501389650001001414650001701424650002101441650001101462650002401473650001301497651001001510653002401520653002001544653002301564653001001587700001801597700002001615700002201635700002101657700005701678700005601735700001701791700001901808773013401827856008301961852000902044655001202053IND60601180520221121020812.0180706e201409  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060118052DNAL7 a10.1016/j.yqres.2014.06.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuang, Shao-Yi10aLate Pleistocene sedimentary history of multiple glacially dammed lake episodes along the Yarlung-Tsangpo river, southeast Tibet  ap. 430-440.  aWe present a reconstructed lithologic column compiled from a series of lacustrine outcrops along a tributary of the Nyang River, a major tributary of the Yarlung-Tsangpo in southeast Tibet. The deposits were preserved between terraces at altitudes of 2950‚Äì3100m asl. The stratigraphic record features at least two sets of coarsening-upward sequences depicting episodic aggradation and progradation of a glacially dammed lake related delta. Recognized facies changes illustrate the evolution cycles of depositional environments from pro-delta, delta front, to delta plain. Radiocarbon and optically stimulated luminescence dates reveal an aging-downward trend in stratigraphic order and provide an approximate timeline for the formation of glacially dammed lakes in late Pleistocene. This result reflects that the Zelunglung Glacier had progressively advanced to block the Yarlung-Tsangpo river and the dam materials had stepwise stacked up to an altitude of 3095m asl during Marine Oxygen Isotope Stages 4 to 2.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaltitude 3aglaciers 3alacustrine sediments 3alakes 3aluminescence 3apaleoclimatology 3arivers 3asediment deposition 3aterraces 3aChina 0aGlacier-dammed lake 0aYarlung-Tsangpo 0aZelunglung Glacier 0aTibet1 aChen, Yue-Gau1 aBurr, George S.1 aJaiswal, Manoj K.1 aLin, Yunung Nina1 aYin, Gongming1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0668-04921 aLiu, Jingwei1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6535-54811 aZhao, Shujun1 aCao, Zhongquan0 tQuaternary research.g2014 Sept., v. 82, no. 2 p.430-440dElsevier Inc.aUniversity of WashingtonwJournal:12398x0033-58947nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.yqres.2014.06.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02030naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001700142245008500159300002000244520102200264592002801286650001501314650001901329650001601348650001701364650001301381700001601394700001701410700005401427773014901481856007701630852000901707655001201716IND60759333220221117223037.0211208e20211123xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075933322DNAL7 a10.1021/jacs.1c078382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhu, Jiannan10aReshaping Membrane Polymorphism of Polymer Vesicles through Dynamic Gas Exchange  ap. 20183-20191.  aThe quest for a universal method to shape the vesicular morphology in dynamic and diversified manners is a challenging topic of cell mimicry.

Such vesicles are assembled by a class of gas-based dynamic polymers, where CO‚ÇÇ connects between the frustrated Lewis pair via dynamic gas-bridged bonds. Use of other competitive gases (N‚ÇÇO, SO‚ÇÇ, or C‚ÇÇH‚ÇÑ) to in situ exchange the CO‚ÇÇ linkages can change the polymer structure and drive the membrane to proceed with three fundamental movements, including membrane stretching, membrane incurvation, and membrane protrusion, thus remolding the shapes of polymersomes. The choices of gas types, concentrations, and combinations are crucial to adjusting the vesicle evolution, local change of membrane curvature, and anisotropic geometrical transformation. This will become a generalized strategy to control the vesicular polymorphism and deformable behavior.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanisotropy 3acarbon dioxide 3adeformation 3agas exchange 3apolymers1 aGong, Zehao1 aYang, Cuiqin1 aYan, Qiang1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5523-26590 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2021 Nov. 23, v. 143, no. 48 p.20183-20191dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19166x1520-51267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jacs.1c078383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02691naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245009400167300001400261500001900275520139300294592002801687650001101715650001301726650001201739650001901751650002801770650002501798700002101823700001801844700001801862700002701880700001801907700001601925700001601941700001901957700001601976700002901992700001702021773012502038856008502163852000902248655001202257IND60679765220221122005949.0210108e202002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067976522DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cosust.2019.12.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aScoones, Ian10aTransformations to sustainability: combining structural, systemic and enabling approaches  ap. 65-75.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe imperatives of environmental sustainability, poverty alleviation and social justice (partially codified in the Sustainable Development Goals or SDGs) call for ambitious societal transformations. As such, few aspects of actionable knowledge for sustainability are more crucial than those concerning the processes of transformation. This article offers a brief overview of different conceptualisations of transformation, and outlines a set of practical principles for effective research and action towards sustainability. We review three approaches to transformations, labelled: ‚Äòstructural‚Äô, ‚Äòsystemic‚Äô and ‚Äòenabling‚Äô. We show how different ways of understanding what we mean by transformations can affect what actions follow. But these approaches are not mutually exclusive. We use an international set of examples on low carbon economy transformations, seed systems, wetland conservation and peri-urban development to show how they can be complementary and reinforcing. We describe three cross-cutting practical considerations that must be taken seriously for effective transformations to sustainability: diverse knowledges, plural pathways and the essentially political nature of transformation. Realizing the ambitions of the SDGs, we conclude, requires being clear about what we mean by transformation, and recognizing these basic methodological principles for action.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3apolitics 3apoverty 3asocial justice 3asustainable development 3awetland conservation1 aStirling, Andrew1 aAbrol, Dinesh1 aAtela, Joanes1 aCharli-Joseph, Lakshmi1 aEakin, Hallie1 aEly, Adrian1 aOlsson, Per1 aPereira, Laura1 aPriya, Ritu1 aVan Zwanenberg, Patrick,1 aYang, Lichao0 tCurrent opinion in environmental sustainability.g2020 Feb., v. 42 p.65-75dElsevier B.V.wJournal:2237x1877-34357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cosust.2019.12.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03606naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245015500171520231500326592002802641650001502669650001802684650001202702650003402714650001602748650001602764650001702780650001002797650000802807650001402815650001102829650001002840650001002850700001902860700001502879700001602894700002502910700002102935773013402956856008503090852000903175655001203184IND60672774620221121051025.0191017e20190613xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067277462DNAL7 a10.1093/cdn/nzz039.OR06-03-192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWambogo, Edwina10aFood Checklist Adjusted Self-reported Dietary Intakes from Food-frequency Questionnaires More Closely Associated with Recovery Biomarkers (OR06-03-19)  aTo compare self-reported dietary intakes using food frequency questionnaires (FFQs) adjusted for 7-d food checklists against recovery biomarkers (doubly labeled water (DLW) for energy; 24-h urine for protein, sodium, potassium). Over 12-months, participants aged 50‚Äì74 years, from the Interactive Diet and Activity Tracking (IDATA) Study, were asked to complete 2 FFQs, 2 7-d, 32-item food checklists, 2 24-h urine collections, and 1 DLW administration. Participants who completed at least 1 FFQ, 1 food checklist with ‚â•5 days, and had DLW and urine results were included (N¬†=¬†742). FFQ energy, protein, sodium, and potassium intakes and densities were calculated both directly (unadjusted) and adjusted by the ratio of reported intakes, calculated as the average percentage of days with reported intake from the 7-d food checklist divided by the summed FFQ frequency for each food group. The discrepancy between FFQ values and biomarkers were determined by comparing mean unadjusted and checklist-adjusted values to biomarkers. Attenuation factors and validity coefficients were determined for all unadjusted and adjusted FFQ values. Overall, adjusting FFQ values by estimates from the 7-d food checklist resulted in higher values for protein, sodium, potassium, and energy. For both men and women, FFQ energy, protein, sodium and potassium values were lower than biomarker estimates, but all differences were reduced when adjusted for checklist values. The greatest reduction in differences between self-reported values (unadjusted vs. adjusted) and biomarkers were seen for sodium and energy intake in females (‚àí36% to ‚àí21% and ‚àí29% to ‚àí14%, respectively), and total energy intake in males (‚àí29% vs. ‚àí14%). , The checklist-adjusted potassium values were higher than the biomarker values, but for men, they were closer to the biomarker. Finally, the adjustment process improved the level of attenuation and validity coefficients for each nutrient and energy. Though past studies have shown 24-h recalls and food records have higher correlations with recovery biomarkers than FFQs, our results suggest that, simple adjustment of FFQs using food checklists reduces reporting error and may improve the power to detect relationships between dietary exposures from FFQs and health outcomes.

With the increase in number of GM maize events globally, cost- and time-efficient diagnostics with on-site applicability are required to check for authorized GM events. Six GM maize events, namely, Bt11, GA21, MON810, MON89034, NK603 and TC1507, also present in 89 stacked events, are being widely commercialized in more than 17 countries. Visual and real-time loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assays targeting these six GM maize events are being reported in the present study. Specificity of the developed LAMP assays was confirmed using fourteen commercialized GM maize events. Limit of detection of visual and real-time LAMP assays targeting Bt11, GA21, MON810, MON89034 and TC1507, was up to 0.01%, detecting 8 target copies, and for NK603 event-specific assays, was up to 0.1% detecting 73 target copies. Practical applicability of developed LAMP assays was verified using a set of five stacked GM maize events, namely, Bt11¬†√ó¬†GA21, MON89034¬†√ó¬†NK603, MON89034¬†√ó¬†NK603¬†√ó¬†TC1507, TC1507¬†√ó¬†NK603 and TC1507¬†√ó¬†MON810; and six powdered maize samples of proficiency testing. The reported LAMP assays can be efficiently employed for screening for presence of selected GM maize events in single or stacked form.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanalytical methods 3acorn 3adetection limit 3adiagnostic techniques 3aloop-mediated isothermal amplification 3ascreening 3atransgenic plants 0aEvent-specific 0aGM maize 0aVisual LAMP 0aReal-time LAMP1 aChhabra, Rashmi1 aRandhawa, Gurinderjit1 aSathiyabama, Muthukrishnan1 aSingh, Monika0 tFood control.g2015 Sept., v. 55 p.18-30dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl56242x0956-71357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodcont.2015.02.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02697naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002400149245014500173300001600318520118400334592002801518650001701546650002001563650001101583650001201594650003301606650001001639650001101649650002101660650001401681650001101695650002201706651001101728653002901739653001901768653001701787653001601804653001101820653001601831653001601847653001501863700002301878700002301901700001901924700002201943773013401965856008302099852000902182655001202191IND60601180620221121030711.0180706e201409  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060118062DNAL7 a10.1016/j.yqres.2014.06.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aReinemann, Scott A.12aA 2000-yr reconstruction of air temperature in the Great Basin of the United States with specific reference to the Medieval Climatic Anomaly  ap. 309-317.  aA sediment core representing the past two millennia was recovered from Stella Lake in the Snake Range of the central Great Basin in Nevada. The core was analyzed for sub-fossil chironomids and sediment organic content. A quantitative reconstruction of mean July air temperature (MJAT) was developed using a regional training set and a chironomid-based WA-PLS inference model (r¬≤jack=0.55, RMSEP=0.9¬∞C). The chironomid-based MJAT reconstruction suggests that the interval between AD 900 and AD 1300, corresponding to the Medieval Climate Anomaly (MCA), was characterized by MJAT elevated 1.0¬∞C above the subsequent Little Ice Age (LIA), but likely not as warm as recent conditions. Comparison of the Stella Lake temperature reconstruction to previously published paleoclimate records from this region indicates that the temperature fluctuations inferred to have occurred at Stella Lake between AD 900 and AD 1300 correspond to regional records documenting hydroclimate variability during the MCA interval. The Stella Lake record provides evidence that elevated summer temperature contributed to the increased aridity that characterized the western United States during the MCA.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChironomidae 3aair temperature 3abasins 3aclimate 3adry environmental conditions 3alakes 3amodels 3apaleoclimatology 3asediments 3asummer 3awater temperature 3aNevada 0aMedieval Climate Anomaly 0aLittle Ice Age 0aPaleoclimate 0aChironomids 0aMidges 0aTemperature 0aGreat Basin 0aSub-alpine1 aPorinchu, David F.1 aMacDonald, Glen M.1 aMark, Bryan G.1 aDeGrand, James Q.0 tQuaternary research.g2014 Sept., v. 82, no. 2 p.309-317dElsevier Inc.aUniversity of WashingtonwJournal:12398x0033-58947nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.yqres.2014.06.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02761naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001400153245009600167300001600263520106700279592002801346650001001374650002201384650001701406650001501423650003201438650001901470650004401489650001301533650001301546650001001559650002401569650001101593650003601604653001901640653001401659653003101673653002201704653001701726653002901743653003201772653003201804653003201836653003201868700001801900700001601918700001301934700001701947700001801964700001801982773009802000856008802098852000902186655001202195IND60585757720221123012254.0201202e201801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058575772DNAL7 a10.1016/j.phytochem.2017.11.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Zhe10aRubipodanones A-D, naphthohydroquinone dimers from the roots and rhizomes of Rubia podantha  ap. 153-160.  aFour previously undescribed naphthohydroquinone dimers named rubipodanones A-D, together with 19 known quinones containing three known napthohydroquinone dimers named rubioncolin C, methyl 5-hydroxy-dinaphtho[1,2-2‚Ä≤,3‚Ä≤]furan-7,12-dione-6-carboxylate and rubialatin B, were isolated from the roots and rhizomes of Rubia podantha.

The conjugate induced the in vitro production of cytokines favouring the Th17 polarization by bone marrow-derived dendritic cells. In short-term protocols, the priming or treatment with the conjugate ameliorated the airway inflammation by shifting Th2 allergen-specific cells into T cells producing IFN-Œ≥, IL-10, but not IL-17A. Similar results were found in long-term protocol where the conjugate down-regulated airway inflammation without any evidence of autoimmune response and B cell compartment expansion. nDer p2-Conj also failed to shorten the spontaneous onset of diabetes on conjugates-primed NOD/LtJ mice. We found that neutrophils in BALF, ROR-Œ≥t and IL-17A expression in lungs were increased in conjugate-treated IL-10KO mice. These data emphasize the role of conjugate-driven IL-10 production, which can regulate the activity of memory Th17 cells and prevent the onset of autoimmune response.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDermatophagoides pteronyssinus 3aT-lymphocytes 3aadenine 3aagonists 3aallergens 3aanimal models 3aautoimmunity 3adendritic cells 3adiabetes 3ainflammation 3ainterferon-gamma 3ainterleukin-10 3ainterleukin-17 3alungs 3amice 3aneutrophils 0aAIT 0aBALF 0aBMDC 0aDC 0ai.t. 0aMNC 0anDer p2 0aAdjuvants 0aVaccines 0aToll-like receptors 0aAdenine-derivatives 0aImmunotherapy1 aNencini, Francesca1 aFil√¨, Lucia1 aOcchiato, Ernesto G.1 aRomagnani, S.q(Sergio),1 aParronchi, Paola1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9184-50891 aMaggi, Enrico1 aVultaggio, Alessandra0 tMolecular Immunology.g2016 Sept., v. 77 p.60-70dElsevier Ltdx0161-58907nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.molimm.2016.07.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02820naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245019800163300001400361520117800375592002801553650001101581650002501592650001801617650002101635650001501656650000901671650001201680650001301692650001801705650002601723650001101749650001901760650001801779650001401797650001001811650001701821650001401838653002301852653001301875653002001888653001701908653002301925653003201948700001501980700001601995700004002011700001702051700001802068773009002086856008102176852000902257655001202266IND60528528820221118112121.0160716e20160115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052852882DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aca.2015.11.0192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHe, Wenshan10aPrinting graphene-carbon nanotube-ionic liquid gel on graphene paper: Towards flexible electrodes with efficient loading of PtAu alloy nanoparticles for electrochemical sensing of blood glucose  ap. 61-68.  aThe increasing demands for portable, wearable, and implantable sensing devices have stimulated growing interest in innovative electrode materials. In this work, we have demonstrated that printing a conductive ink formulated by blending three-dimensional (3D) porous graphene‚Äìcarbon nanotube (CNT) assembly with ionic liquid (IL) on two-dimensional (2D) graphene paper (GP), leads to a freestanding GP supported graphene‚ÄìCNT‚ÄìIL nanocomposite (graphene‚ÄìCNT‚ÄìIL/GP). The incorporation of highly conductive CNTs into graphene assembly effectively increases its surface area and improves its electrical and mechanical properties. The graphene‚ÄìCNT‚ÄìIL/GP, as freestanding and flexible substrates, allows for efficient loading of PtAu alloy nanoparticles by means of ultrasonic-electrochemical deposition. Owing to the synergistic effect of PtAu alloy nanoparticles, 3D porous graphene‚ÄìCNT scaffold, IL binder and 2D flexible GP substrate, the resultant lightweight nanohybrid paper electrode exhibits excellent sensing performances in nonenzymatic electrochemical detection of glucose in terms of sensitivity, selectivity, reproducibility and mechanical properties.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalloys 3aanalytical chemistry 3ablood glucose 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3agels 3aglucose 3agraphene 3aionic liquids 3amechanical properties 3amixing 3ananocomposites 3ananoparticles 3ananotubes 3apaper 3asurface area 3asynergism 0aAlloy nanoparticle 0aGraphene 0aCarbon nanotube 0aIonic liquid 0aFlexible electrode 0aNonenzymatic glucose sensor1 aSun, Yimin1 aXi, Jiangbo1 aAbdurhman, Abduraouf Alamer Mohamed1 aRen, Jinghua1 aDuan, Hongwei0 tAnalytica chimica acta.g2016 Jan. 15, v. 903 p.61-68dElsevier B.V.x0003-26707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aca.2015.11.0193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01886naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100002200137245007400159300001600233500002000249520098300269592002801252650002901280650002701309650001201336650001401348650001101362773014301373856007101516852000901587655001201596IND60680226820221119160859.0200104e196911  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068022682DNAL7 a10.2307/12377802doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrubaker, Earl R.10aDevelopment of Soviet Agriculture under a Vintage Model of Production  ap. 882-902.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe purpose of this paper is to examine within the framework provided by a vintage model of productive activity the pertinent evidence on output, inputs, and the age of fixed capital to further understanding of the sources of growth (1928‚Äì62) in Soviet agricultural output. The basic procedure consists of tentatively accepting the embodiment hypothesis, which states that any positive growth in factor productivity is the consequence of improved quality of fixed capital. Data on the age of capital are taken as indicative of its technological quality, and implied rates of growth in such quality are computed as a residual. Conclusions drawn from strict acceptance of the hypothesis are tempered to account for additional qualitative evidence and for the possibility that equipment may be a more effective carrier than structures. Everything considered, it seems that the embodiment hypothesis can make a useful contribution to understanding Soviet agricultural development.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural development 3aagricultural economics 3acapital 3aequipment 3amodels0 tAmerican journal of agricultural economics.g1969 Nov., v. 51, no. 4 p.882-902dOxford University PresswJournal:jnl44932x0002-90927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2307/12377803Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01735naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006000148245009800208300001600306500001900322520060400341592002800945650001200973650001600985650002401001700006501025700006601090700005901156773012601215856008301341852000901424655001201433IND60715639520221119220659.0201129e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071563952DNAL7 a10.1007/s10546-020-00530-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEdwards, John M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5784-321810aRepresentation of Boundary-Layer Processes in Numerical Weather Prediction and Climate Models  ap. 511-539.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aBoundary-layer schemes are essential components of numerical weather-forecasting and climate models.

Given the importance of CH‚ÇÑ in greenhouse gas emission inventories, the characteristics of China‚Äôs CH‚ÇÑ emissions at different scales deserve to be fully understood. Presented in this paper is an interprovincial input-output embodiment analysis of China‚Äôs regional CH‚ÇÑ emissions in 2007, based on the most recently available multi-regional input-output table, and relevant CH‚ÇÑ emissions data. The results show that the eastern, central and western areas contribute to 48.2%, 28.6%, and 23.3% of the national total embodied emissions, respectively. Guangdong has the highest level of embodied CH‚ÇÑ emissions among all of the 30 regions. The Agriculture sector produces the most embodied CH‚ÇÑ emissions in final demand, followed by the Construction, Food Production and Tobacco Processing, and Other Service Activities sectors. Significant net transfers of embodied CH‚ÇÑ emission flows are identified from the central and western areas to the eastern area via interregional trade. Shanxi is the largest interregional exporter of embodied CH‚ÇÑ emissions. In contrast, Guangdong is the largest interregional importer. Energy activities, agricultural activities, and waste management comprise 65.6%, 30.7%, and 3.7% of the total embodied CH‚ÇÑ emissions in interregional trade, respectively. By using consumption-based accounting principles, the emission magnitudes, per capita emissions, and emission intensities of most eastern regions increase remarkably, while those of some central and western regions decrease largely. To achieve regional CH‚ÇÑ emission mitigation, comprehensive mitigation measures should be designed under consideration of regional transfer of emission responsibility.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural industry 3aenergy 3afood production 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3ainventories 3amethane 3atobacco 3atrade 3awaste management 3aChina1 aLi, Jiashuo1 aPeng, Beihua0 tFrontiers of earth science.g2014 Mar., v. 8, no. 1 p.163-180dSpringer-Verlagx2095-01957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11707-014-0408-0  aDNAL 7aarticle01697naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100002800137245005800165300001600223500002000239520065800259592002800917650002700945650001400972650001500986650002201001650001601023650001701039650001201056650001101068650002401079700002101103773014301124856007101267852000901338655001201347IND60680226920221119160855.0200104e196911  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068022692DNAL7 a10.2307/12377732doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTyrchniewicz, Edward W.10aEconometric Analysis of the Agricultural Labor Market  ap. 770-787.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aPrevious research on the market for agricultural labor is extended through the use of a simultaneous‚Äêequations model consisting of six equations.

One of the leading polymers for this separation is poly[2,2‚Ä≤-(m-phenylene)-5,5‚Ä≤-bisbenzimidazole] (PBI), which has good thermal stability and high H‚ÇÇ/CO‚ÇÇ selectivity. This study, for the first time, demonstrates that H‚ÇÇ/CO‚ÇÇ selectivity can be significantly enhanced by chemical cross-linking of PBI in solid state, in distinct contrast with the literature where cross-linking PBI in solutions decreased H‚ÇÇ/CO‚ÇÇ selectivity. We prepared a series of cross-linked PBIs by immersing PBI thin films in terephthaloyl chloride solutions for varying times to achieve different degrees of cross-linking, and then systematically investigated the effect of cross-linking on physical properties including gel content, thermal stability, cross-linking density, fractional free volume (FFV) and inter-chain spacing. Gas sorption and pure- and mixed-gas permeation properties were determined at temperatures ranging from 35 to 200 ¬∞C. Cross-linking decreased CO‚ÇÇ sorption and significantly increased H‚ÇÇ/CO‚ÇÇ selectivity with a slight decrease in H‚ÇÇ permeability. For example, after cross-linking of PBI, the H‚ÇÇ/CO‚ÇÇ selectivity increased from 15 to 23 while the H‚ÇÇ permeability decreased from 45 to 39 Barrers at 200 ¬∞C. The performance of this cross-linked PBI surpasses the Robeson's upper bound estimated at 200 ¬∞C, indicating its promise for H‚ÇÇ purification and CO‚ÇÇ capture.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon dioxide 3acrosslinking 3agels 3ahydrogen 3ananomaterials 3aorganochlorine compounds 3apermeability 3apolymers 3asorption 3atemperature 3athermal stability1 aSwihart, Mark T.1 aLin, Haiqing0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2017 Sept. 26, v. 5, no. 37 p.19914-19923dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c7ta03874g3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02562naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001900152245010000171300001600271520120600287592002801493650001701521650001901538650000901557650001301566650002201579650001501601650001001616650001201626650001501638650000901653650002001662650002101682653000901703653002301712653001801735653001701753653003001770700001501800700001701815700002201832700001801854700001701872773009501889856008701984852000902071655001202080IND60543106720221118162644.0190408e201508  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054310672DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodcont.2015.02.0212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHan, Jian-long10aStudy of the pesticides distribution in peel, pulp and paper bag and the safety of pear bagging  ap. 338-346.  aHow to decrease the pesticides residue is a new challenge during growing, storage and processing of agricultural products. Pesticides distribution or migration study would be the key point to find a pesticide removal method. 173 pesticide components in peel, pulp or paper bag were extracted by acetonitrile after fortified with chlorpyrifos-d10 as isotope internal standard. The extract was simply purified by dispersive sorbent of primary secondary amine (PSA) and then measured by online gel permeation chromatography-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GPC-GC/MS). The positive results were used to study the pesticides distribution properties in peel, pulp and paper bag. The pesticides distribution properties between peel and pulp were well applied for pesticides removal, risk assessment and suitable eating way for pear. Except of pesticides with strong polarity and high water solubility, most of the pesticides stayed in the skin of a pear and can be eliminated by peeling. A pear is safe for pesticides residue if eaten with peeling and might exist risk to some degree if eaten without peeling. The practical application of pear bagging is safe as far as pesticides residue is concerned.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetonitrile 3achromatography 3agels 3aisotopes 3amass spectrometry 3apaper pulp 3apears 3apeeling 3apesticides 3arisk 3arisk assessment 3awater solubility 0aPear 0aPesticides residue 0aPeel and pulp 0aPear bagging 0aDistribution or migration1 aFang, Ping1 aXu, Xiao-min1 aLi-Zheng, Xue-jiu1 aShen, Hai-tao1 aRen, Yi-ping0 tFood control.g2015 Aug., v. 54 p.338-346dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl56242x0956-71357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodcont.2015.02.0213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02467naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002200149245016800171300001600339520116700355592002801522650002201550650001001572650001101582650000901593651001001602651001401612653002601626653003101652653002501683653001501708653002401723653001201747653001001759700002601769700001601795700002001811773013401831856008301965852000902048655001202057IND60601181020221120123215.0180706e201409  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060118102DNAL7 a10.1016/j.yqres.2014.07.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWestgate, John A.10aDistinction between the Youngest Toba Tuff and Oldest Toba Tuff from northern Sumatra based on the area density of spontaneous fission tracks in their glass shards  ap. 388-393.  aDetermination of the area density of spontaneous fission tracks (œÅs) in glass shards of Toba tephra is a reliable way to distinguish between the Youngest Toba Tuff (YTT) and the Oldest Toba Tuff (OTT). The œÅs values for YTT, uncorrected for partial track fading, range from 70 to 181tracks/cm¬≤ with a weighted mean of 108¬±5tracks/cm¬≤, based on 15 samples. Corrected œÅs values for YTT are in the range of 77‚Äì140tracks/cm¬≤ with a weighted mean of 113¬±8tracks/cm¬≤, within the range of uncorrected œÅs values. No significant difference in œÅs exists between YTT samples collected from marine and continental depositional settings. The uncorrected œÅs for OTT is 1567¬±114tracks/cm¬≤ so that confusion with YTT is unlikely.The œÅs values of the Toba tephra at Bori, Morgaon, and Gandhigram in northwestern India indicate a YTT identity, in agreement with geochemical data on their glass shards, the presence of multiple glass populations, and a glass fission-track age determination. Therefore, the view of others that OTT is present at these sites ‚Äì and thereby indicates an early Pleistocene age for the associated Acheulean artifacts ‚Äì is incorrect.  aPublisher supplied data 3aage determination 3aglass 3atephra 3atuff 3aIndia 3aIndonesia 0aVolcanic glass shards 0aSpontaneous fission tracks 0aPartial track fading 0aToba tuffs 0aAcheulean artifacts 0aSumatra 0aIndia1 aPearce, Nicholas J.G.1 aGatti, Emma1 aAchyuthan, Hema0 tQuaternary research.g2014 Sept., v. 82, no. 2 p.388-393dElsevier Inc.aUniversity of WashingtonwJournal:12398x0033-58947nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.yqres.2014.07.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02157naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001700145245010000162300001600262500001900278520102000297592002801317650002601345650002601371650001301397650001101410650002101421650001301442653001801455653001101473653001101484700002001495700002201515700001501537773014301552856007901695852000901774655001201783IND60706048820221120080045.0200807e201612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070604882DNAL7 a10.18805/asd.v36i4.64792doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAbhivyakti, 10aEffect of plastic mulches on soil temperature and tomato yield inside and outside the polyhouse  ap. 333-336.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe present investigation was carried out to study the performance of Tomato (cv: All rounder) under both polyhouse and open condition with different plastic mulches.

This study aimed to explore the association of daily mean temperature with the daily counts of COVID-19 cases in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Shenzhen, China. Data on daily confirmed cases of COVID-19 and daily mean temperatures were retrieved from the 4 first-tier cities in China. Distributed lag nonlinear models (DLNMs) were used to assess the association between daily mean temperature and the daily cases of COVID-19 during the study period. After controlling for the imported risk index and long-term trends, the distributed lag nonlinear model showed that there were nonlinear and lag relationships. The daily cumulative relative risk decreased for every 1.0¬†¬∞C change in temperature in Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Shenzhen. However, the cumulative relative risk increased with a daily mean temperature below‚Äâ‚àí‚Äâ3¬†¬∞C in Beijing and then decreased. Moreover, the delayed effects of lower temperatures mostly occurred within 6‚Äì7¬†days of exposure. There was a negative correlation between the cumulative relative risk of COVID-19 incidence and temperature, especially when the temperature was higher than‚Äâ‚àí‚Äâ3¬†¬∞C. The conclusions from this paper will help government and health regulators in these cities take prevention and protection measures to address the COVID-19 crisis and the possible collapse of the health system in the future.  aPublisher supplied data  a81202254cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a71974199cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  aLJKQZ2021027cthe Science Foundation of Liaoning Provincial Department of Education 3aCOVID-19 infection 3anonlinear models 3apandemic 3apollution 3arelative risk 3aresearch 3atemperature 3atime series analysis 3aChina1 aYang, Shu-qin1 aLv, Cai-xia1 aAn, Shu-yi1 aGuan, Peng1 aHuang, De-sheng1 aZhou, Bao-sen1 aWu, Wei0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research.g2022 June, v. 29, no. 27 p.41534-41543dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-021-18382-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02465naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002000143245012200163300001400285520153000299592002801829650001201857650001301869650001401882650001901896651001601915651002201931773013601953856007702089852000902166655001202175IND60524015220221120123835.0160701e20040301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052401522DNAL7 a10.5586/asbp.2004.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aG√≥rski, Piotr,14aThe Nardo-Gnaphalietum supini plant association in the Western Carpathians (the Tatra Mts and the Babia G√≥ra Massif)  ap. 71-77.  aThis article is the first published information on the occurrence of the snow-beds of Nardo-Gnaphalietum supini in the Western Carpathians. So far, localities of Nardo-Gnaphalietum supini phytocoenoses have been known exclusively from the Alps, the Black Forest, and the Eastern Carpathians. During this study, carried out in the Polish Carpathians, phytocoenoses of Nardo-Gnaphalietum were recorded in the two highest massifs - the Tatra Mountains and the Babia G√≥ra Massif. They were closely related to anthropogenically-influenced sites with exposed and lumped ground located near tourist routes. Habitat characterization and spatial complexes of the patches of Nardo-Gnaphalietum in the investigated area are given herein.Critical revision of phytosociological data from the Alps and the Eastern Carpathians revealed that the discussed phytocoenoses have been described within the communities of Luzuletum alpino-pilosae, Salicetum herbaceae or Nardetum strictae. In this study, all phytosociological data concerning the association were collected and the floristic distinction of the phytocoenoses of particular mountain massifs is discussed. A new subassociation Nardo-Gnaphalietum oligotrichetosum hercynici was distinguished on the basis of local habitat variability. Although Nardo-Gnaphalietum supini does not have characteristic species, it is a well-distinguished typological unit in the class Salicetea herbaceae Br.-Bl. 1948, and is a central association of the alliance Nardo-Salicion herbaceae Englisch 1999.  aPublisher supplied data 3aforests 3ahabitats 3amountains 3aphytosociology 3aAlps region 3aCarpathian region0 tActa Societatis Botanicorum Poloniae.g2004 Mar. 01, v. 73, no. 1 p.71-77dPolish Botanical SocietywJournal:12967x0001-69777nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.5586/asbp.2004.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02787naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006300148245009200211300001200303500001900315520149500334592002801829596006101857650001401918650001601932650002701948650001301975650000901988650001101997650002802008650002002036651001002056700001902066700001902085700001602104700002502120773015202145856008302297852000902380655001202389IND60709261220221120154430.0201124e202010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070926122DNAL7 a10.1007/s10661-020-08585-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRoy, Shouraseni Sen1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4158-708210aAlarming groundwater depletion in the Delhi Metropolitan Region: a long-term assessment  ap. 620.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aGroundwater in Delhi Metropolitan Region (DMR) is suffering from multiple catastrophes, viz., asymptotic increases in groundwater withdrawal, reduced recharge due to erratic rainfall, and variable soil type. In this study, we examined long-term trends in groundwater levels across the DMR from 1996 to 2018. Station level data collected by the Central Groundwater Board for 258 stations at the seasonal scale were visualized and interpreted using geospatial analysis. The spatial patterns of the trends in groundwater levels revealed increasing depths of groundwater levels, except the Yamuna River floodplains. The main cause for the decline is related to the rapid growth in population accompanied with high-density impervious urban land uses, leading to lower levels of recharge vs unlimited withdrawal of groundwater for daily needs. In addition, the local geology in the form of clayey soils in northwest DMR also contributed to the lower levels of recharge. The results of the analysis enabled us to establish the trend and delineate the zones of differential recharge. Furthermore, the level of contaminants were analyzed at the district level for fluorides and nitrates. The presence of fluoride contamination was mostly concentrated in the northwestern district, while the nitrate exceedance was more widespread. These findings will help in achieving the 6th Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) of United Nations by 2030 as well as goals identified in Delhi‚Äôs master plan of 2041.  aPublisher supplied data  aNAcFulbright Nehru Academic and Professional Excellence 3afluorides 3agroundwater 3agroundwater extraction 3anitrates 3arain 3arivers 3asustainable development 3awater shortages 3aIndia1 aRahman, Atiqur1 aAhmed, Shakeel1 aShahfahad, 1 aAhmad, Ishita Afreen0 tEnvironmental monitoring and assessment.g2020 Oct., v. 192, no. 10 p.620-620dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl33242x0167-63697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-020-08585-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03426naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002000146245025700166300002000423500001900443520157800462592002802040650001602068650003502084650003902119650001702158650002502175650003602200650001002236650001902246650001102265650002102276650001602297650001702313650002602330650002902356650004402385650001502429653002002444653002602464653002802490700001702518700001302535700002102548700001602569700005302585700001902638773015002657856008002807852000902887655001202896IND60720156020221120162110.0201209e20201125xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072015602DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jafc.0c054072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZheng, Yun-Feng10aComprehensive Comparison of Two Color Varieties of Perillae Folium Using Rapid Resolution Liquid Chromatography Coupled with Quadruple-Time-of-Flight Mass Spectrometry (RRLC-Q/TOF-MS)-Based Metabolic Profile and in Vivo/in Vitro Anti-Oxidative Activity  ap. 14684-14697.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aPerillae Folium (PF), which is extensively used as a dietary vegetable and medicinal herb, contains two varietal forms corresponding to purple perilla leaf (Perilla frutescens var. crispa) and green perilla leaf (Perilla frutescens var. frutescens). However, the components and efficacy of different PF varieties remain underexplored so far. In the present work, a nontargeted rapid resolution liquid chromatography coupled with quadruple-time-of-flight mass spectrometry (RRLC-Q/TOF-MS)-based metabolomics approach was developed to investigate the difference in the chemical compositions between green PF and purple PF. A total of 71 compounds were identified or tentatively identified, among which 7 phenolic acids, 10 flavonoids, and 9 anthocyanins were characterized as differential metabolites. In addition, heatmap visualization and ultraperformance liquid chromatography coupled with triple-quadrupole tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC‚ÄìTQ-MS/MS)-based quantitative analysis revealed that flavonoids and anthocyanins especially had higher contents in purple PF. Furthermore, the anti-oxidative activities of two varietal PFs were evaluated in vivo zebrafish and in vitro human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). The results showed that the purple PF had more pronounced anti-oxidative activities than did the green PF, which may be due to the presence of anthocyanins and a higher concentration of flavonoids in its phytochemical profile. The outcome of the present study is expected to provide useful insight on the comprehensive utilization of a PF resource.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDanio rerio 3aPerilla frutescens var. crispa 3aPerilla frutescens var. frutescens 3aanthocyanins 3aantioxidant activity 3achemical constituents of plants 3acolor 3afood chemistry 3aleaves 3amedicinal plants 3ametabolites 3ametabolomics 3aquantitative analysis 3atandem mass spectrometry 3aultra-performance liquid chromatography 3avegetables 0aPerillae Folium 0ametabolomics approach 0aanti-oxidative activity1 aLi, Dan-Yang1 aSun, Jie1 aCheng, Jian-Ming1 aChai, Chuan1 aZhang, Li1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7936-38641 aPeng, Guo-Ping0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2020 Nov. 25, v. 68, no. 49 p.14684-14697dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:12177x1520-51187nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jafc.0c054073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02522naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245015000170520136000320592002801680650002601708650001501734650001501749650001701764650002101781650001501802650001901817650002201836700001801858700001401876700001601890700001401906700001701920773012801937856008602065852000902151655001202160IND60754300620221122220022.0211023e20211003xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075430062DNAL7 a10.3390/microorganisms91020902doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYing, Yi-Tian 10aAnnexin A2-Mediated Internalization of Staphylococcus aureus into Bovine Mammary Epithelial Cells Requires Its Interaction with Clumping Factor B  aBackground: Staphylococcus aureus is a leading cause of contagious mastitis in dairy cattle. Internalization of S. aureus by bovine mammary gland epithelial cells is thought to be responsible for persistent and chronic intramammary infection, but the underlying mechanisms are not fully understood. Methods: In the present study, we evaluated the role of Annexin A2 (AnxA2), a membrane-binding protein, in S. aureus invasion into bovine mammary epithelial cell line (MAC-T). In vitro binding assays were performed to co-immunoprecipitate the binding proteins of AnxA2 in the lysates of S. aureus. Results: AnxA2 mediated the internalization but not adherence of S. aureus. Engagement of AnxA2 stimulated an integrin-linked protein kinase (ILK)/p38 MAPK cascade to induce S. aureus invasion. One of the AnxA2-precipitated proteins was identified as S. aureus clumping factor B (ClfB) through use of mass spectrometry. Direct binding of ClfB to AnxA2 was further confirmed by using a pull-down assay. Pre-incubation with recombinant ClfB protein enhanced S. aureus internalization, an effect that was specially blocked by anti-AnxA2 antibody. Conclusion: Our results demonstrate that binding of ClfB to AnxA2 has a function in promoting S. aureus internalization. Targeting the interaction of ClfB and AnxA2 may confer protection against S. aureus mastitis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aStaphylococcus aureus 3aantibodies 3acell lines 3adairy cattle 3aepithelial cells 3aepithelium 3amammary glands 3amass spectrometry1 aRen, Wei-Jia 1 aTan, Xun 1 aYang, Jing 1 aLiu, Rui 1 aDu, Ai-Fang 0 tMicroorganisms.g2021 Oct. 03, v. 9, no. 10dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27145x2076-26077nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/microorganisms91020903Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle05153naa a2200841 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245016000165520279100325592002803116650002403144650001203168650002603180650002403206650001603230650002303246650001503269650001203284650002503296650001503321650001303336650001503349650001103364650001303375650002903388650001503417650002203432650000903454650001703463650002103480650001203501650002003513650002103533650001003554650001403564650001603578651001203594651001103606651001203617651001003629653001603639653001203655653001503667653001603682653001403698653002303712700001803735700002303753700002303776700001803799700001903817700002103836700002203857700002303879700001803902700001703920700002803937700001803965700001803983700002104001700001704022700002404039700002204063700001904085773010304104856008304207852000904290655001204299IND60673923920221122234254.0200121e202001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067392392DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agsy.2019.1027062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHall, Rea M.10aVegetation management intensity and landscape diversity alter plant species richness, functional traits and community composition across European vineyards  aLand-use intensification at the field and landscape scale is a strong driver for declining biodiversity and ecosystem service provision. Vineyards are characterised by non-productive inter-rows, which could potentially host diverse plant communities. Mulching, tillage or herbicides are used to mitigate the competition between vines and the inter-row vegetation. As plant species with the same set of functional traits will respond similarly to environmental filters like management measures, knowledge about plant trait‚Äìenvironment-relations can be used to predict community and ecosystem processes which are essential for preserving ecosystem services like soil erosion mitigation. We hypothesized that higher vegetation management intensity reduces plant (functional) diversity, changes functional traits and community composition.Across Europe, four viticultural regions in Austria, France, Spain and Romania, which comprised 78 vineyards differing in vegetation management intensity (bare soil, temporary and permanent vegetation cover), were selected for sampling vascular plant diversity. Around each vineyard, the surrounding landscape composition and landscape diversity was investigated within a 750m radius. Rao's quadratic entropy as a measure of functional diversity was calculated based on a selection of plant functional traits. The effects of management and landscape variables on species richness, functional traits, functional diversity and vegetation cover were analysed by generalized linear mixed models and random forests (RF). Furthermore, plant community composition was analysed with non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS).Higher management intensities resulted in lower species richness, functional diversity and vegetation cover. The country with the related divergent edaphoclimatic conditions was a significant factor affecting most diversity and functional trait parameters, whereas landscape diversity increased plant species richness only slightly. Vegetation management intensity had the highest explanatory power for species richness, functional diversity and most functional traits according to RF analysis. Consequently, plant functional traits like a higher coverage of ruderals and annuals could be clearly related to bare soil management. Furthermore, the type of cover crops influenced the relationship between annual and perennial plant species, Grime plant strategy types and species diversity. Accordingly, NMDS showed a separation between permanent vegetation cover and bare soil vineyards. The overall positive effect of extensive management and the use of diverse cover crops or spontaneous vegetation in vineyard inter-rows should be better implemented in agricultural policies to support both, biodiversity and ecosystem provision.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural policy 3aannuals 3abotanical composition 3acommunity structure 3acover crops 3aecosystem services 3aecosystems 3aentropy 3afunctional diversity 3aherbicides 3aland use 3alandscapes 3amodels 3amulching 3amultidimensional scaling 3aperennials 3aplant communities 3asoil 3asoil erosion 3aspecies richness 3atillage 3avascular plants 3avegetation cover 3avines 3avineyards 3aviticulture 3aAustria 3aFrance 3aRomania 3aSpain 0aAgroecology 0aTillage 0aHerbicides 0aCover crops 0aLandscape 0aEcosystem services1 aPenke, Nicole1 aKriechbaum, Monika1 aKratschmer, Sophie1 aJung, Vincent1 aChollet, Simon1 aGuernion, Muriel1 aNicolai, Annegret1 aBurel, Fran√ßoise,1 aFertil, Albin1 aLora, √Ångel1 aS√°nchez-Cuesta, Rafael1 aGuzm√°n, Gema1 aGomez, Jos√©,1 aPopescu, Daniela1 aHoble, Adela1 aBunea, Claudiu-Ioan1 aZaller, Johann G.1 aWinter, Silvia0 tAgricultural systems.g2020 Jan., v. 177 p.102706-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl7186x0308-521X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agsy.2019.1027063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03202naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002500111040001800136100002100154245012500175300001600300500002400316520174800340650002602088650002502114650001602139650002602155650002402181650001202205650001802217650001202235650001202247650001102259650001602270650001002286650002502296650001702321650001602338650001202354650003602366650003502402650001702437651001202454700002102466700002102487773011602508852000902624856007502633655001202708IND4461530620221121140702.0110819s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446153062DNAL7 a222516912pmid7 a10.1603/EN103122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRhodes, Elena M.10aExamining the Spatial Distribution of Flower Thrips in Southern Highbush Blueberries by Utilizing Geostatistical Methods  ap. 893-903.  aIncludes references  aFlower thrips (Frankliniella spp.) are one of the key pests of southern highbush blueberries (Vaccinium corymbosum L. x V. darrowii Camp), a high-value crop in Florida. Thrips' feeding and oviposition injury to flowers can result in fruit scarring that renders the fruit unmarketable. Flower thrips often form areas of high population, termed ‚Äúhot spots‚Äù, in blueberry plantings. The objective of this study was to model thrips spatial distribution patterns with geostatistical techniques. Semivariogram models were used to determine optimum trap spacing and two commonly used interpolation methods, inverse distance weighting (IDW) and ordinary kriging (OK), were compared for their ability to model thrips spatial patterns. The experimental design consisted of a grid of 100 white sticky traps spaced at 15.24-m and 7.61-m intervals in 2008 and 2009, respectively. Thirty additional traps were placed randomly throughout the sampling area to collect information on distances shorter than the grid spacing. The semivariogram analysis indicated that, in most cases, spacing traps at least 28.8 m apart would result in spatially independent samples. Also, the 7.61-m grid spacing captured more of the thrips spatial variability than the 15.24-m grid spacing. IDW and OK produced maps with similar accuracy in both years, which indicates that thrips spatial distribution patterns, including ‚Äúhot spots,‚Äù can be modeled using either interpolation method. Future studies can use this information to determine if the formation of ‚Äúhot spots‚Äù can be predicted using flower density, temperature, and other environmental factors. If so, this development would allow growers to spot treat the ‚Äúhot spots‚Äù rather than their entire field. 3aFrankliniella tritici 3aVaccinium corymbosum 3ablueberries 3aenvironmental factors 3aexperimental design 3aflowers 3ageostatistics 3agrowers 3akriging 3amodels 3aoviposition 3apests 3aspatial distribution 3asticky traps 3atemperature 2aAnimals 2aBlueberry Plantsxparasitology. 2aGeographic Information Systems 2aThysanoptera 3aFlorida1 aLiburd, Oscar E.1 aGrunwald, Sabine0 tEnvironmental entomology.g2011 Aug., v. 40, no. 4 p.893-903dEntomological Society of Americax0046-225X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1603/EN103123Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02638naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002300143245009900166300001600265520133200281592002801613650002501641650001801666650001101684650001501695650001801710650001301728650001601741650001901757650001501776650002601791650002301817650001101840650001801851650001401869650002201883650001001905650001401915650001501929700002401944773013801968856007702106852000902183655001202192IND60524015620221120135417.0160701e20031201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052401562DNAL7 a10.5586/asbp.2003.0362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPiƒÖtczak, Ewelina10aIn vitro regeneration of Centaurium erythraea Rafn from shoot tips and other seedling explants  ap. 283-288.  aVarious explants from 30-day-old seedlings of Centaurium erythraea Rafn were evaluated for their morphogenetic capacity under in vitro culture conditions. Shoot formation from shoot tip explants was achieved mainly through adventitious bud differentiation. The highest number of shoots (up to 43.3 ¬± 2.2 from a single shoot tip) was obtained on Murashige and Skoog medium (MS) supplemented with indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) (0.57 ŒºM) and 6-benzylaminopurine (BAP) (4.4 ŒºM). Adventitious shoot regeneration was also achieved through organogenesis from calluses obtained from hypocotyls, cotyledons, roots and leaves on MS medium containing IAA (2.85 ŒºM) and BAP (0.88 ŒºM). Significant differences were noted between explant types in their effects on shoot regeneration. In the primary culture, the best response was obtained either from calluses derived from roots or leaves (44.4 ¬± 4.5 and 40.2 ¬± 6.0 shoots per callus, respectively). The number of subcultures of inoculated calluses affected both the multiplication rate (the number of shoots/explant) and shoot morphology (the frequency of shoot hyperhydricity). Shoots rooted with the frequency of 94-100% after culture on MS medium without growth regulators. Plantlets were successfully acclimatized (97%) under high relative humidity and then moved to the greenhouse.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCentaurium erythraea 3abenzyladenine 3acallus 3acotyledons 3aculture media 3aexplants 3agreenhouses 3ahyperhydricity 3ahypocotyls 3ain vitro regeneration 3aindole acetic acid 3aleaves 3aorganogenesis 3aplantlets 3arelative humidity 3aroots 3aseedlings 3ashoot tips1 aWysoki≈Ñska, Halina0 tActa Societatis Botanicorum Poloniae.g2003 Dec. 01, v. 72, no. 4 p.283-288dPolish Botanical SocietywJournal:12967x0001-69777nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.5586/asbp.2003.0363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02245naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245011200165300001400277520096600291592002801257650001501285650001801300650002001318650002401338650001901362650001301381650000901394650001201403650001801415650002701433650001601460653001801476653002401494653000701518653002101525700001501546700001801561700001401579700001501593773010101608856008101709852000901790655001201799IND60590695720221120112405.0180314e20180310xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059069572DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tca.2018.01.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZheng, Dalong10aResearch on thermal decomposing properties of phosphogypsum with Fe addition under multi-atmosphere control  ap. 59-66.  aPhosphogypsum (PG) is a by-product of phosphor acid producing, which has become the primary barrier for the development of phosphate fertilizer industry.

Results from the TGA revealed that the initial decomposing temperature of PG was 590‚ÄØ¬∞C, lower 300‚ÄØ¬∞C than without FeCl3 immersion. The decompositions of PG and lignite in multi-atmosphere were performed at different molar ratio in the tube furnace, when the molar ratio of lignite and PG was 1.2:1, the purity of CaO in solid products could reach 90.6%. Fluidized bed experiments were done in a vertical tube furnace, results indicated that after a multi-atmospheres cycles experiment, target production CaO purity could achieve 93.8%.

These results suggested that SA treatment might be a powerful strategy to enhance antioxidant potential of cornelian cherry fruits. In addition, these results suggested that enhanced antioxidant potential of cornelian cherry fruits treated with SA might be due to the stimulation of PAL enzyme activity and thus triggering the phenylpropanoid‚Äìflavonoids pathways.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCornus mas 3aacid treatment 3aanthocyanins 3aantioxidant activity 3aascorbic acid 3aenzyme activity 3afruits 3aphenols 3aphenylalanine ammonia-lyase 3asalicylic acid 0aCornelian cherry 0aAntioxidant 0aPostharvest 0aSalicylic acid 0aDPPH scavenging 0aPhenylalanine ammonia-lyase1 aAghdam, Morteza Soleimani1 aFard, Javad Rezapour1 aHassanpour, Hamid0 tScientia horticulturae.g2013 May 02, v. 154 p.31-36dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4108x0304-42387nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scienta.2013.01.0253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02233naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002300143245013200166300001600298520114500314592002801459650001901487650001401506650001301520650001101533650001101544650001401555650001101569650002001580650001501600650001901615700002501634773013801659856007701797852000901874655001201883IND60524015720221120135517.0160701e20031201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052401572DNAL7 a10.5586/asbp.2003.0372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPrzyby≈Ç, Krystyna10aUltrastructural changes in chloroplasts of mesophyll cells of chlorotic and prematurely yellowed leaves of Betula pendula Rothr  ap. 289-293.  aThe ultrastructure of chloroplasts was studied in mesophyll cells of the leaves of silver birch (Betula pendula) showing interveinal chlorosis or premature yellowing, in comparison with leaves without symptoms or exhibiting symptoms of natural senescence. The leaves were collected between May 26 to June 7 and additionally in the September 10-12 from the upper part of the crown, from increments of the past four years. No major difference in ultrastructure of chloroplasts was found between spongy and palisade mesophyll cells. The following senescencerelated changes were observed in chloroplasts of prematurely yellowed leaves and showing inteveinal chlorosis: reduced chloroplast size, degeneration of the membrane systems of thylakoids and increased electron density of plastoglobuli. The most electron dark globules (lipid droplets) were found together with starch grains in cells of spongy mesophyll of leaves showing interveinal chlorosis. Abnormal, spherical and rounded chloroplasts with electron-dark inside of thylakoids or the electron-dark stroma between thylakoids were found only in yellowed and chlorotic leaves in spring.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBetula pendula 3achlorosis 3adroplets 3aleaves 3alipids 3amesophyll 3aspring 3astarch granules 3athylakoids 3aultrastructure1 aIdzikowska, Krystyna0 tActa Societatis Botanicorum Poloniae.g2003 Dec. 01, v. 72, no. 4 p.289-293dPolish Botanical SocietywJournal:12967x0001-69777nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.5586/asbp.2003.0373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02047naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001700153245010800170300001300278520078200291592002801073650002301101650001401124650001301138650001201151650001801163650002001181650001401201651001601215653002901231653002001260653001801280653001401298653001301312653001701325700002101342700001801363700001801381700001501399773010301414856008701517852000901604655001201613IND60552533420221118011208.0161021e20130510xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055253342DNAL7 a10.1016/j.forsciint.2013.01.0362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLloyd, Aimee10aLab-on-a-chip screening of methamphetamine and pseudoephedrine in samples from clandestine laboratories  ap. 8-14.  aThe clandestine manufacture of methamphetamine in New Zealand predominantly involves the reduction of pseudoephedrine, extracted from pharmaceutical preparations, using hydrogen iodide. This method of illicit manufacture leaves a variety of materials at the scene that are a rich source of information. Efficient processing and preliminary identification of extraction and reaction mixtures, precursors and products is essential to minimise exposure to potential hazardous materials and to provide investigative and intelligence information.

Dox side effects are however a major drawback in an efficient medicinal utilization. Cyclodextrin inclusion is an effective approach to enhance drug delivery and stability. In this research host ‚àí guest complex formation of Dox cytotoxic drug with gamma-cyclodextrin (Œ≥CD) in aqueous solutions and in solid state was investigated by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), thermogravimetry (TG), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) analysis, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), ultraviolet-visible (UV‚Äìvis) spectroscopy, isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) and pH measurements. The thermodynamic parameters were discussed considering the weak interactions between Œ≥CD and Dox molecules. UV‚Äìvis and ITC gave comparable results regarding the formation constant and thermodynamic parameters values. The data indicated that the Œ≥CD/Dox complex in the aqueous solution is formed in a 1:1 stoichiometry ratio and the binding process of Œ≥CD with Dox is exothermic and enthalpy controlled, but entropy driven. The solid state characterization of the Œ≥CD/Dox complex indicated the occurrence of complexation by encapsulation of the hydroxyanthraquinonic rings of Dox into Œ≥CD cavity and come to support and complete the data resulted from liquid state investigation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aadverse effects 3aaqueous solutions 3acytotoxicity 3adifferential scanning calorimetry 3adoxorubicin 3aencapsulation 3aenthalpy 3aentropy 3agamma-cyclodextrin 3aheat production 3aliquids 3apH 3ascanning electron microscopy 3astoichiometry 3athermogravimetry 3atitration 3aultraviolet-visible spectroscopy 0aCyclodextrin 0aDoxorubicin 0aInclusion complexes 0aThermal analysis0 tThermochimica acta.g2018 Mar. 10, v. 661 p.51-58dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11747x0040-60317nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tca.2018.01.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01760naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245013800172300001800310520062800328592002800956650003700984650001301021650001601034650001401050650001801064650001001082651001001092653001501102653002901117653001601146653002401162653001001186700002001196773011001216856005101326852000901377655001201386IND50087641320221118234118.0140412e20111001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008764132DNAL7 a10.1080/00222933.2011.6028062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMiyamoto, Hiroomi12aA new deep-sea benthopelagic chaetognath of the genus Bathyspadella (Chaetognatha) with ecological and molecular phylogenetic remarks  ap. 2785-2794.  aA new chaetognath, Bathyspadella oxydentata, collected from Sagami Bay, central Japan, is described.

To elucidate the dynamic changes in the molecular mechanisms of Salix under salt stress, we generated gene expression profiles and examined changes in the expression of those genes. RNA-Seq was used to produce six cDNA libraries constructed from the leaves of Salix‚Äâ√ó‚Äâjiangsuensis CL ‚ÄòJ2345‚Äô treated with NaCl for 0, 2, 6, 12, 24 and 48¬†h. In total, 249 million clean reads were assembled into 12,739 unigenes, all of which were clustered into 10 profiles based on their temporal expression patterns. KEGG analysis revealed that as an early defense response, the biosynthesis pathways of cutin, suberin and wax, which are involved in cell wall structure, were activated beginning at 2¬†h. The expression of secondary metabolism genes, including those involved in the phenylpropanoid, flavonoid, stilbenoid, diarylheptanoid and gingerol pathways, peaked at 6¬†h and 24¬†h; the upregulated genes were mainly involved in plant hormone pathways and beta-alanine, galactose and betalain metabolism. We identified roles of key phytohormones and found ETH to be the major signaling molecule activating TFs at 12¬†h; ETH, ABA, IAA and SA were the key molecules at 24¬†h. Moreover, we found that the upregulated genes were associated with elevated levels of amino acids, sucrose, inositol, stress proteins and ROS-scavenging enzymes, contributing to the maintenance of water balance. This research constitutes the first detailed analysis of salt stress-related mechanisms in Salix and identifies potential targets for genetic manipulation to improve yields.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSalix 3aabscisic acid 3abeta-alanine 3abetalains 3abiosynthesis 3acDNA libraries 3acell walls 3acomplementary DNA 3acutin 3aenvironmental impact 3aenzymes 3aflavonoids 3agalactose 3agene expression 3agene expression regulation 3agenetic engineering 3aindole acetic acid 3ainositols 3aleaves 3aproteins 3asalicylic acid 3asalt stress 3asalt tolerance 3asequence analysis 3asodium chloride 3asoil salinization 3astress response 3asuberin 3asucrose 3atranscriptomics 3aunigenes1 aHuang, Jing1 aTian, Xueyao1 aZheng, Jiwei1 aHe, Xudong0 tJournal of forestry research.g2020 Oct., v. 31, no. 5 p.1851-1862dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:J000000106x1007-662X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11676-019-00941-w3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01891naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245009500163300001400258520070100272592002800973650002201001650003801023650002401061650003301085650001901118650003701137653000901174653002101183653002801204653002201232653001501254700001801269700001201287700001501299773010101314856008101415852000901496655001201505IND60590695920221122133529.0180314e20180310xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059069592DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tca.2018.01.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Haibo10aPhase equilibria of the La-Y system: A metastable samarium-type LaY intermetallic compound  ap. 41-50.  aRare earth elements are recently attracting more and more interests due to their dramatic effect as alloying elements.

Previous studies have reported the beneficial effects of Bifidobacterium on colitis, while the related mechanisms behind these effects have not been fully elucidated. The aim of our study is to investigate the alleviation effect of Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis XLTG11 (B. lactis) on dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis and its potential mechanism. The results showed that B. lactis XLTG11 significantly decreased weight loss, disease activity index score, colon shortening, myeloperoxide activity, spleen weight, and colon tissue damage. Additionally, B. lactis XLTG11 significantly decreased the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and increased the level of anti-inflammatory cytokine. Meanwhile, high doses of B. lactis XLTG11 significantly up-regulated the expression of tight junction proteins and inhibited activation of Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)/myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MYD88)/nuclear factor-Œ∫B (NF-Œ∫B) signaling pathway. Furthermore, B. lactis XLTG11 increased the gut microbiota diversity and modulated gut microbiota composition caused by DSS. Moreover, Spearman‚Äôs correlation analysis also found that several specific gut microbiota were significantly correlated with colitis-related indicators. These results demonstrated that B. lactis XLTG11 can alleviate DSS-induced colitis by inhibiting the activation of the TLR4/MYD88/NF-Œ∫B signaling pathway, regulating inflammatory cytokines, improving intestinal barrier function, and modulating the gut microbiota.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis 3aToll-like receptor 4 3acolitis 3acolon 3acytokines 3adextran sulfate 3aintestinal microorganisms 3aspleen 3atight junctions 3aweight loss1 aWang, Song 1 aXu, Baofeng 1 aLiu, Fei 1 aHuo, Guicheng 1 aLi, Bailiang 0 tMicroorganisms.g2021 Oct. 03, v. 9, no. 10dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27145x2076-26077nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/microorganisms91020933Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03247naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001600146245011000162300002000272500001900292520150700311592002801818650001801846650002001864650002501884650002701909650001801936650001401954650002301968650001701991650001102008650001902019650001202038650002102050650001102071650001502082650002902097650002602126650003702152653001502189653001402204653001302218653001402231653001502245653002202260653002202282700002302304700001302327700001702340700001702357700005602374773015002430856008002580852000902660655001202669IND60720156520221120162208.0201209e20201123xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072015652DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jafc.0c058232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuang, Daye10aDiscovery of Œ≥-Lactam Alkaloid Derivatives as Potential Fungicidal Agents Targeting Steroid Biosynthesis  ap. 14438-14451.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aBiological control of plant pathogens is considered as one of the green and effective technologies using beneficial microorganisms or microbial secondary metabolites against plant diseases, and so microbial natural products have played important roles in the research and development of new and green agrochemicals. To explore the potential applications for natural Œ≥-lactam alkaloids and their derivatives, 26 Œ≥-lactams that have flexible substituent patterns were synthesized and characterized, and their in vitro antifungal activities against eight kinds of plant pathogens belonging to oomycetes, basidiomycetes, and deuteromycetes were fully evaluated. In addition, the high potential compounds were further tested using an in vivo assay against Phytophthora blight of pepper to verify a practical application for controlling oomycete diseases. The potential modes of action for compound D1 against Phytophthora capsici were also investigated using microscopic technology (optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and transmission electron microscopy) and label-free quantitative proteomics analysis. The results demonstrated that compound D1 may be a potential novel fungicidal agent against oomycete diseases (EC‚ÇÖ‚ÇÄ = 4.9748 Œºg¬∑mL‚Äì¬π for P. capsici and EC‚ÇÖ‚ÇÄ = 5.1602 Œºg¬∑mL‚Äì¬π for Pythium aphanidermatum) that can act on steroid biosynthesis, which can provide a certain theoretical basis for the development of natural lactam derivatives as potential antifungal agents.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBasidiomycota 3aDeuteromycotina 3aPhytophthora capsici 3aPythium aphanidermatum 3aagrochemicals 3aalkaloids 3abiological control 3abiosynthesis 3ablight 3afood chemistry 3alactams 3alight microscopy 3apepper 3aproteomics 3aresearch and development 3asecondary metabolites 3atransmission electron microscopy 0aŒ≥-lactams 0asynthesis 0abioassay 0aoomycetes 0aP. capsici 0aP. aphanidermatum 0aproteomic profile1 aWang, Shuangshuang1 aSong, Di1 aCao, Xiufang1 aHuang, Wenbo1 aKe, Shaoyong1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2715-40050 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2020 Nov. 23, v. 68, no. 49 p.14438-14451dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:12177x1520-51187nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jafc.0c058233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02636naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002600148245015800174300001800332520137800350592002801728650001301756650001201769650001001781650001801791650001201809650002201821650002201843650002001865650001401885650001501899650002201914651000901936700002601945700002001971700001901991773013602010856008302146852000902229655001202238IND60709262020221120164107.0210108e202010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070926202DNAL7 a10.1007/s11676-019-00947-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShahriari, Hafizollah10aDiversity and biomass of different functional groups of herbaceous species along an altitudinal gradient in the semi-arid Zagros mountain forests of Iran  ap. 1723-1731.  aThe response of diversity and biomass of herbaceous functional groups along an altitudinal gradient in mountainous forests of southern Zagros, Khuzestan Province, Iran was studied by sampling vegetation in 30 circular 1000-m¬≤ plots in herb layer of the forest floor within 646‚Äì2447¬†m asl (lowland: <‚Äâ1000¬†m asl, midland: 1000‚Äì2000¬†m asl, highland: >‚Äâ2000¬†m asl). The most important herbaceous functional groups were classified based on two aspects of growth form: annuals‚Äìperennials, grasses‚Äìforbs. Then the relationship between the diversity, richness, evenness, biomass and elevation was analyzed. The results showed that the annual functional group in the low- and midland classes, and perennial functional group in the lowland class had the highest species diversity and evenness in annual and perennial functional groups, respectively (p‚Äâ<‚Äâ0.01). The perennials in the highland class had the maximum total, above- and belowground dry biomass (p‚Äâ<‚Äâ0.01). On the other hand, the forb functional group in the lowland class had the greatest species diversity, richness, and evenness (p‚Äâ<‚Äâ0.01) and in the highland class had the maximum total dry, above- and belowground dry biomass in the grass and forb functional groups (p‚Äâ<‚Äâ0.01). Increasing the diversity, richness, and species evenness resulted in a decrease in the plant dry biomass.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaltitude 3abiomass 3aforbs 3aforest litter 3agrasses 3aground vegetation 3aherbaceous plants 3amontane forests 3amountains 3aperennials 3aspecies diversity 3aIran1 aAbrari Vajari, Kambiz1 aPilehvar, Babak1 aHeydari, Mehdi0 tJournal of forestry research.g2020 Oct., v. 31, no. 5 p.1723-1731dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:J000000106x1007-662X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11676-019-00947-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02222naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131100002300149245008400172300001600256520119900272592002801471650001601499650001401515650001601529650001101545650002001556650002301576650002401599650002101623650001501644650001101659700001501670773009301685856008501778852000901863655001201872IND4465754920221119134952.0141110e20120806xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446575492DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhydrol.2012.05.0652doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAzamathulla, H.Md.10aFlow discharge prediction in compound channels using linear genetic programming  ap. 203-207.  aFlow discharge determination in rivers is one of the key elements in mathematical modelling in the design of river engineering projects. Because of the inundation of floodplains and sudden changes in river geometry, flow resistance equations are not applicable for compound channels. Therefore, many approaches have been developed for modification of flow discharge computations. Most of these methods have satisfactory results only in laboratory flumes. Due to the ability to model complex phenomena, the artificial intelligence methods have recently been employed for wide applications in various fields of water engineering. Linear genetic programming (LGP), a branch of artificial intelligence methods, is able to optimise the model structure and its components and to derive an explicit equation based on the variables of the phenomena. In this paper, a precise dimensionless equation has been derived for prediction of flood discharge using LGP. The proposed model was developed using published data compiled for stage‚Äìdischarge data sets for 394 laboratories, and field of 30 compound channels. The results indicate that the LGP model has a better performance than the existing models.  aPublisher supplied data 3aengineering 3aequations 3afloodplains 3afloods 3aflow resistance 3alinear programming 3amathematical models 3amodel validation 3aprediction 3arivers1 aZahiri, A.0 tJournal of hydrology.g2012 Aug. 6, v. 454-455 p.203-207dElsevier B.V.x0022-16947nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2012.05.0653Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02901naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001400150245009000164300001400254520127300268592002801541650001601569650001701585650001601602650001901618650001801637650003101655650001001686650002301696650001301719650001501732650001601747650002101763650002001784650004301804650001801847650001901865650002101884650001401905653001401919653001901933653002501952653001101977653001001988700001901998700001402017700001602031700001602047700001902063700001602082700001602098700001802114773008602132856008402218852000902302655001202311IND60562618220221120091947.0170208e201605  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056261822DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envpol.2016.01.0352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMu, Xiyan14aThe developmental effect of difenoconazole on zebrafish embryos: A mechanism research  ap. 18-26.  aDifenoconazole is a widely used triazole fungicide and has been reported to have negative impacts on zebrafish embryos. To investigate the mechanism of its developmental toxicity, zebrafish embryos were exposed to 0.5 and 2.0¬†mg/L difenoconazole for 96¬†h. The morphological and physiological indicators of embryo development were tested. The total cholesterol (TCHO) level, triglyceride (TG) level and malondialdehyde (MDA) content were measured at 96 hpf (hours post-fertilization). In addition, the transcription of genes related to embryo development, the antioxidant system, lipid synthesis and metabolism was quantified. Our results showed that a large suite of symptoms were induced by difenoconazole, including hatching regression, heart rate decrease, growth inhibition and teratogenic effects. 0.5¬†mg/L difenoconazole could significantly increase the TG content of zebrafish embryos at 96 hpf, while no apparent change in the TCHO and MDA level was observed post 96¬†h exposure. Q-PCR (quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction) results showed that the transcription of genes related to embryonic development was decreased after exposure. Genes related to hatching, retinoic acid metabolism and lipid homeostasis were up-regulated by difenoconazole.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDanio rerio 3aantioxidants 3acholesterol 3adifenoconazole 3aembryogenesis 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3agrowth retardation 3ahatching 3aheart rate 3ahomeostasis 3alipid metabolism 3amalondialdehyde 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3aretinoic acid 3ateratogenicity 3atriacylglycerols 3atriazoles 0aZebrafish 0aDifenoconazole 0aDevelopmental effect 0aEmbryo 0aLipid1 aChai, Tingting1 aWang, Kai1 aZhu, Lizhen1 aHuang, Ying1 aShen, Gongming1 aLi, Yingren1 aLi, Xuefeng1 aWang, Chengju0 tEnvironmental pollution.g2016 May, v. 212 p.18-26dElsevier Ltdx0269-74917nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2016.01.0353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02811naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245012200167300001600289520158400305592002801889650001301917650001101930650002001941650001901961650001201980650001501992650003502007653003102042653003402073653000802107653000902115653002902124653001702153653002802170700002202198773009902220856008502319852000902404655001202413IND60609718420221119100309.0200523e201810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060971842DNAL7 a10.1016/j.powtec.2018.07.0612doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVollmari, K.10aNumerical and experimental analysis of particle residence times in a continuously operated dual-chamber fluidized bed  ap. 625-637.  aFluidized beds that consist of multiple chambers are used in various processes including granulation, drying or coating. As overly short or long particle residence times inside the vessel are undesirable, it is of high interest to measure and detect the influences of variations of the operational parameters on the particle residence times so that they can be adjusted accordingly to gain narrow particle residence time distributions. For this purpose, an ultra-high frequency (UHF) radio frequency identification system (RFID) has been developed, that is able to detect multiple particles without a direct line-of-sight at different positions inside the vessel. Furthermore, coupled discrete element method (DEM)/computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations have been carried out to study a continuously operated laboratory scale dual-chamber fluidized bed. To examine the influences of operational and particle parameters 10 different variations have been evaluated both numerically and experimentally. Results show good agreement between simulation and experiment for most cases. The highest change of the residence times could be achieved by changing the particle mass inflow and the fluidization velocity. The results for non-spherical particles showed some deviations in the longer residence times, as certain particle/wall effects were not fully recreated in the simulation. Nonetheless, it was proven that coupled DEM-CFD simulations can be a useful tool in the prediction of residence time which can greatly help to optimize continuously operated fluidized processes.  aPublisher supplied data 3acoatings 3adrying 3afluid mechanics 3afluidized beds 3apowders 3aprediction 3aradio frequency identification 0aDual-chamber fluidized bed 0aDEM (discrete element method) 0aCFD 0aRFID 0aParticle residence times 0aFluidization 0aNon-spherical particles1 aKruggel-Emden, H.0 tPowder technology.g2018 Oct., v. 338 p.625-637dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11732x0032-59107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.powtec.2018.07.0613Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02941naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245010000167500001900267520164600286592002801932650002601960650002401986650001702010650001702027650002102044650001602065650001702081650001802098650001902116650001902135653002702154653002602181653003302207700001802240700001902258700002002277700001802297773011202315856008302427852000902510655001202519IND60721134720221119222437.0210201e20210315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072113472DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bios.2020.1129022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Dongxing,10aLight-sheet skew rays enhanced U-shaped fiber-optic fluorescent immunosensor for Microcystin-LR  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aA novel U-shaped fiber-optic evanescent-wave fluorescent immunosensor was designed that exploits light-sheet excitation of skew rays in a passive fiber for sensitive microcystin-LR (MC-LR) detection in real-time. In particular, a light sheet comprising a thin plane of light can be concentrated into exciting the optimum ray group, resulting in enhanced interaction between light and fluorophores. Meanwhile, skew rays excited by transmitting light into an optical fiber with an angle offset allow a much higher number of total-internal-reflections with increased interaction length along the fiber interface, which strengthens the light-matter interactions. Under the optimal angle offset, the proposed evanescent wave fluorescent immunosensor is the first demonstration of integrating light-sheet skew rays and a U-shaped fiber-optic probe for enhanced sensitivity. The results show that fluorescence sensitivity of the U-shaped fiber-optic probe with light-sheet skew rays excitation is 16 times higher than that of collimated skew rays excitation. Combined with this newly designed light-sheet skew rays enhanced U-shaped fiber-optic fluorescent immunosensor, a sensitive and real-time MC-LR detection method was established based on the indirect competitive immunoassay principle. Real environmental water samples spiked with MC-LR were determined by the immunosensor with recovery rates between 85% and 112%. The present system could be an alternative tool for the on-site environmental monitoring, in-field food safety assurance and clinical diagnostics. It also advances the fiber-optic sensors field in terms of experimental design.  aPublisher supplied data 3adiagnostic techniques 3aexperimental design 3afiber optics 3afluorescence 3afluorescent dyes 3afood safety 3aimmunoassays 3aimmunosensors 3amicrocystin-LR 3aoptical fibers 0aU-shaped optical fiber 0aLight-sheet skew rays 0aEvanescent wave immunosensor1 aXing, Yunpeng1 aZhou, Xiaohong1 aChen, George Y.1 aShi, Hanchang0 tBiosensors & bioelectronics.g2021 Mar. 15, v. 176 p.112902-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11631x0956-56637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bios.2020.1129023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02162naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245010700169300001800276520084600294592002801140650002301168650002001191650003301211650003001244650002201274650001401296650001901310650002701329653002301356653002201379653002001401653002501421653003001446700002101476700002301497700002001520700001901540773008701559856008501646852000901731655001201740IND60554088820221120025423.0161024e201407  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055408882DNAL7 a10.1016/j.procbio.2014.03.0252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOgino, Chiaki14aThe effect of combining signal sequences with the N28 fragment on GFP production in Aspergillus oryzae  ap. 1078-1083.  aEffective secretion of green fluorescent protein (GFP) was investigated by the screening signal sequences for GFP secretion in Aspergillus oryzae. GFP production in A. oryzae was evaluated using fusions with signal sequences from Taka-amylase A (TAA), glucoamylase A, glucoamylase B, and triacylglycerol lipase. The TAA signal sequence promoted the highest protein secretion of GFP. Fusing this signal sequence with an N-terminal 28-amino acid region (N28 fragment) from the Rhizopus oryzae lipase signal sequence increased protein secretion. In addition, using multiple copies of this signal sequence, instead of the N28 fragment, also induced protein secretion. These results show that using multiple signal sequences or combining a signal sequence with the N28 fragment can be used to improve heterogeneous protein secretion in A. oryzae.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAspergillus oryzae 3aRhizopus oryzae 3aglucan 1,4-alpha-glucosidase 3agreen fluorescent protein 3aprotein secretion 3ascreening 3asignal peptide 3atriacylglycerol lipase 0aAspergillus oryzae 0aProtein secretion 0aSignal sequence 0aTaka-amylase A (TAA) 0aMultiple signal sequences1 aMatsuda, Tetsuya1 aOkazaki, Fumiyoshi1 aTanaka, Tsutomu1 aKondo, Akihiko0 tProcess Biochemistry.g2014 July, v. 49 p.1078-1083dElsevier Ltdx1359-51137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.procbio.2014.03.0253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02468naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002100145245012300166300001600289520128300305592002801588650001501616650001801631650001401649650001001663650002701673650001901700650001001719650001301729650001601742650002801758650001401786650001601800700002301816700002501839773012801864856008101992852000902073655001202082IND4456618420221122032223.0141112e201104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445661842DNAL7 a10.1016/j.lwt.2010.08.0172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNikoli√Ñ¬á, Nada10aEffect of buckwheat flour addition to wheat flour on acylglycerols and fatty acids composition and rheology properties  ap. 650-655.  aIn this paper, the rheological properties and lipids composition with an emphasis on acylglycerols and fatty acids composition of dough with various portions of buckwheat flour (BWF) are investigated.

Like many Gram-negative bacteria, it is becoming resistant to many frontline antibiotics, such as carbapenem and cephalosporin antibiotics. In Egypt, K. pneumoniae is increasingly recognised as an emerging pathogen, with high levels of antibiotic resistance. However, few Egyptian K. pneumoniae strains have been sequenced and characterised. Hence, here, we present the genome sequence of a multidrug resistant K. pneumoniae strain, KPE16, which was isolated from a child in Assiut, Egypt. We report that it carries multiple antimicrobial resistance genes, including a blaNDM‚Çã‚ÇÅ carbapenemase and extended spectrum Œ≤-lactamase genes (i.e., blaSHV‚Çã‚ÇÑ‚ÇÄ, blaTEM‚Çã‚ÇÅB, blaOXA‚Çã‚Çâ and blaCTX‚ÇãM‚Çã‚ÇÅ‚ÇÖ). By comparing this strain with other Egyptian isolates, we identified common plasmids, resistance genes and virulence determinants. Our analysis suggests that some of the resistance plasmids that we have identified are circulating in K. pneumoniae strains in Egypt, and are likely a source of antibiotic resistance throughout the world.  aPublisher supplied data 3aKlebsiella pneumoniae 3aanimal pathogens 3aantibiotic resistance 3abacteremia 3abeta-lactamase 3acarbapenems 3acephalosporins 3achildren 3ahumans 3aindustrialization 3amultiple drug resistance 3anucleotide sequences 3aplasmids 3apneumonia 3asequence analysis 3aurinary tract 3avirulence 3aEgypt1 aAlhammadi, Munirah M.1 aHassan, Ehsan A.1 aAhmed, Entsar H.1 aAbu-Faddan, Nagla H.1 aDaef, Enas A.1 aBusby, Stephen J.

Misdiagnosis or delayed diagnosis is a major factor contributing to poor outcomes of AK. This study aimed to assess the effect of two antibiotics and one anaesthetic drug used in the diagnosis and nonspecific management of keratitis on the autofluorescence patterns of Acanthamoeba and two common bacteria that may also cause keratitis. Acanthamoeba castellanii ATCC 30868, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 9027, and Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 6538 were grown then diluted in either PBS (bacteria) or ¬º strength Ringer‚Äôs solution (Acanthamoeba) to give final concentrations of 0.1 OD at 660 nm or 10‚Å¥ cells/mL. Cells were then treated with ciprofloxacin, tetracycline, tetracaine, or no treatment (na√Øve). Excitation‚Äìemission matrices (EEMs) were collected for each sample with excitation at 270‚Äì500 nm with increments in 5 nm steps and emission at 280‚Äì700 nm at 2 nm steps using a Fluoromax-4 spectrometer. The data were analysed using MATLAB software to produce smoothed color-coded images of the samples tested. Acanthamoeba exhibited a distinctive fluorescence pattern compared to bacteria. The addition of antibiotics and anaesthetic had variable effects on autofluorescence. Tetracaine altered the fluorescence of all three microorganisms, whereas tetracycline did not show any effect on the fluorescence. Ciprofloxacin produced changes to the fluorescence pattern for the bacteria, but not Acanthamoeba. Fluorescence spectroscopy was able to differentiate Acanthamoeba from P. aeruginosa and S. aureus in vitro. There is a need for further assessment of the fluorescence pattern for different strains of Acanthamoeba and bacteria. Additionally, analysis of the effects of anti-amoebic drugs on the fluorescence pattern of Acanthamoeba and bacteria would be prudent before in vivo testing of the fluorescence diagnostic approach in the animal models.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcanthamoeba castellanii 3aPseudomonas aeruginosa 3aStaphylococcus aureus 3aanesthetics 3aanimals 3aciprofloxacin 3acomputer software 3afluorescence 3afluorescence emission spectroscopy 3akeratitis 3amorbidity 3aspectrometers 3atetracycline 3avision1 aMahbub, Saabah B.1 aSherpa, Tashi Doma1 aSubedi, Dinesh 1 aHabibalahi, Abbas 1 aAnwer, Ayad G.1 aGu, Zi 1 aWillcox, Mark D.

A total of 29 samples were tested. Samples were collected from a variety of locations throughout the six governorates of Kuwait and 23 brands of local and imported bottled water samples were collected from the local market. The concentration of bacterial endotoxin was measured by using the standard Limulus Amoebocyte lysate test, gel clot method. This study showed that measured endotoxin concentrations in tap drinking water varied from 2.4 to 33.8¬†EU/ml with the average endotoxin concentration of 14.2¬†EU/ml. While the results of endotoxin concentrations in the bottled water were <0.03 to 20.1¬†EU/ml with an average of 1.96¬†EU/ml. The average concentration of endotoxin in bottled water is 13.5 % of the average concentration of endotoxin in tap drinking water. This experimental investigation has proved that drinking bottled water has less endotoxin as compared to tap water in Kuwait. It is also demonstrated that the endotoxin concentration did not exceed the acceptable level in drinking tap water.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEuropean Union 3aLimulus 3abottled water 3adrinking 3amarkets 3atap water 3aKuwait1 aMustafa, Seham1 aAl-Saffar, Nabeel1 aShahjahan, Muhammed0 tEnvironmental monitoring and assessment.g2012 Dec., v. 184, no. 12 p.7323-7328dSpringer-Verlagx0167-63697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-011-2501-0  aDNAL 7aarticle02849naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245016400168300001600332520142000348592002801768650000801796650001201804650001901816650001901835650000901854650001501863650002201878650001501900650001701915650001301932650002601945650001701971650001301988650001702001653002802018653002402046653003602070653003502106653002602141700001602167773011302183856008602296852000902382655001202391IND60591212320221119100624.0210603e20180420xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059121232DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2018.01.2652doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTang, Yuting10aLife cycle environmental and economic analysis of pulverized coal oxy-fuel combustion combining with calcium looping process or chemical looping air separation  ap. 271-292.  aThis paper presents multi-criteria environmental and economic analyses of pulverized coal power plants with various advanced CO‚ÇÇ capture and separation (CCS) technologies, including oxy-fuel combustion (Oxy), calcium looping post-combustion capture (CaL), combination of Oxy with CaL (Oxy-CaL) and Oxy with chemical looping air separation (Oxy-CLAS). The life cycle analysis (LCA) and techno-economic analysis (TEA) are integrated with Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) and Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) approaches. This methodology is applied to forecast the potential of incorporating CaL or CLAS into oxy-fuel combustion and identify the most promising CCS technology option for pulverized coal power plants from the perspectives of different stakeholders. The results show that application of CCS reduces the ecosystem quality and the human health impacts, but increases the resources use and yields an economic penalty of $12.76‚àº$33.33 per ton of CO‚ÇÇ avoidance. From the perspective of industry only, CCS has an unfavorable effect on the performance of the pulverized coal power plant, and the promotion in carbon price is critical for CCS to attract the support from industry. In terms of the four CCS technologies, Oxy-CLAS comprehensively performs the best, followed by Oxy. Decrement of consumption of Ca-based sorbents is critical for Oxy-CaL to outrank Oxy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3acalcium 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbon markets 3acoal 3acombustion 3aeconomic analysis 3aecosystems 3ahuman health 3aindustry 3alife cycle assessment 3apower plants 3asorbents 3astakeholders 0aCalcium looping process 0aOxy-fuel combustion 0aChemical looping air separation 0aMulti-criteria decision making 0aLife cycle assessment1 aYou, Fengqi0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2018 Apr. 20, v. 181 p.271-292dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2018.01.2653Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01839naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001200146245011800158300001800276520074800294592002801042650002101070650002201091650001601113650002401129650001401153650001901167700001501186700001501201700001301216700001801229700001701247773013401264856008201398852000901480655001201489IND60538311020221119153114.0160815e20150826xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053831102DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.iecr.5b019032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYu, Tao10aEnhanced Photoelectrochemical Performance of Coaxial-Nanocoupled Strontium-Rich SrTiO3/TiO2 {001} Nanotube Arrays  ap. 8193-8200.  aThe composition of a photocatalyst is the fundamental determinant of its photoability.

Several recent eukaryotic genome projects have reported multiple gene sequences that were much more similar to homologues in bacteria than to any eukaryotic sequence. In the spirit of the times, horizontal gene transfer from bacteria to eukaryotes has been invoked in some of these cases. Here, we show, using comparative sequence analysis, that some of those bacteria‚Äêlike genes indeed appear likely to have been horizontally transferred from bacteria to eukaryotes. In other cases, however, the evidence strongly indicates that the eukaryotic DNA sequenced in the genome project contains a sample of non‚Äêintegrated DNA from the actual bacteria, possibly providing a window into the host microbiome. Recent literature suggests also that common reagents, kits and laboratory equipment may be systematically contaminated with bacterial DNA, which appears to be sampled by metagenome projects non‚Äêspecifically. We review several bioinformatic criteria that help to distinguish putative horizontal gene transfers from the admixture of genes from autonomously replicating bacteria in their hosts' genome databases or from the reagent contamination.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aamino acid sequences 3abacteria 3abioinformatics 3adatabases 3aeukaryotic cells 3agenes 3ahorizontal gene transfer 3ahosts 3alaboratory equipment 3ametagenomics 3amicrobiome 3anucleotide sequences 3aphylogeny 3asequence analysis1 aLappi, Tanya1 aZudina, Liudmila1 aMushegian, Arcady R.0 tEnvironmental microbiology.g2015 July, v. 17, no. 7 p.2203-2208dBlackwell Sciencex1462-29127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1462-2920.128543Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02971naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245011600168500002200284520167700306592002801983650000902011650001802020650002402038650002502062650001602087650002502103651001202128653002602140653002502166653003102191653001702222653003702239700001602276700001802292700002302310700001902333700001802352773008802370856008202458852000902540655001202549IND60557828620221119204159.0161103s2016    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055782862DNAL7 a10.1016/j.gete.2016.10.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRomero, Enrique10aStudying the thermal conductivity of a deep eocene clay formation: Direct measurements vs back-analysis results  aPre-press version  aAn experimental study on Ypresian clays‚Äìone of the potential deep and sedimentary clay formations in Belgium for the geological disposal of heat-emitting radioactive waste‚Äìhas been undertaken to systematically study its thermal conductivity using different experimental techniques. As a first step, a new experimental setup with heat flux measurement has been used and careful pre-conditioning protocols have been followed to directly measure this thermal property. The aim of these pre-conditioning tests has been ensuring a very high degree of saturation and the closure of fissures / gaps along bedding planes before the thermal tests are run under low stress conditions. Thermal tests have shown to be particularly sensitive when the thermal conductivity is determined along a direction orthogonal to these bedding planes. The study is then complemented by using a constant volume heating cell, in which heating pulse tests have been carried out under fully saturated conditions that have been ensured with a high water back-pressure. Numerical models have been used to interpret this pulse test, to exploit all the information provided by temperature measurements and to back-analyse the thermal conductivity. Direct thermal conductivity data with the improved pre-conditioning protocol allowed obtaining results consistent with the values reported when using back-analysis in the constant volume cell. The article discusses the importance of restoring full saturation conditions, particularly on retrieval of deep sedimentary clays, which may undergo opening of fissures along bedding planes that may affect the correct determination of the thermal conductivity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclay 3aheat transfer 3amathematical models 3asaturated conditions 3atemperature 3athermal conductivity 3aBelgium 0aDeep sedimentary clay 0aThermal conductivity 0aThermal conductivity setup 0aHeating cell 0aBack-analysis thermal properties1 aSau, N√∫ria1 aLima, Analice1 aVan Baelen, Herv√©1 aSillen, Xavier1 aLi, Xiangling0 tGeomechanics for Energy and the Environment.g2016, dElsevier Ltdx2352-38087nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gete.2016.10.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02427naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245011800168500001900286520126800305592002801573650001901601650001901620650001101639650001601650650002101666653002201687653003301709653002801742653003201770653001001802653002301812700001501835700001901850773009001869856008501959852000902044655001202053IND60717917820221116153736.0210212e20210201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071791782DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2020.1192612doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Horng-Wen10aParametric optimization of wall-mounted cuboid rows installed in interdigitated flow channel of HT-PEM fuel cells  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aHigh temperature proton exchange membrane (HT-PEM) fuel cells reduce water management problems and tolerates CO better in a polybenzimidazole (PBI) membrane because they work at temperatures higher than 120¬†¬∞C. This paper examines the effect of setting wall-mounted cuboid rows in the interdigitated flow channel on the performance of HT-PEM fuel cells through experiments and simulations. The results of numerically analyzing the four flow channels show that setting the wall-mounted cuboid rows in top half parts of the channel can improve the cell performance. The best net electric power occurs at the arrangement of Case I increasing net electric power by 7.82% compared to the smooth interdigitated flow channel.The Case I design is then used to conduct the experiment with L‚ÇÇ‚Çá orthogonal array of the Taguchi method to determine different optimal combined factors. The best combined factor level raises 191.09% electrical power than that for the minimum pressure loss, but it decreases the pressure drop than that for maximum power up to 17.00%. Applying Nyquist plots compares the internal impedance between various optimal parameters combinations of Case I and the smooth interdigitated flow channel to confirm the polarization performance results.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTaguchi method 3aelectric power 3aenergy 3atemperature 3awater management 0aHT-PEM fuel cells 0aInterdigitated flow channels 0aWall-mounted cuboid row 0aTaguchi experimental method 0aANOVA 0aImpedance analysis1 aHo, Tzu-Yi1 aHan, Yueh-Jung0 tEnergy.g2021 Feb. 01, v. 216 p.119261-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2020.1192613Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02425naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002200146245011200168300001800280520126500298592002801563650004401591650002201635650001801657650002201675650002001697650003801717650001601755650001901771650001901790650001601809700002501825773013401850856008201984852000902066655001202075IND60538311120221119153139.0160815e20150826xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053831112DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.iecr.5b019132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKrishnama, Anusha10aEffect of Hydrophilicity of Clay on Cold Crystallization of Poly(trimethylene terephthalate) Nanocomposites  ap. 8183-8192.  aPoly(trimethylene terephthalate) (PTT) nanocomposites with two different clays were fabricated via a novel two-step process. Structure, morphology, and cold crystallization of these nanocomposites were studied using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, and X-ray diffraction (XRD). XRD results reveals that PTT-15A nanocomposites were fully exfoliated, whereas PTT-30B nanocomposites were partially exfoliated. Non-isothermal cold crystallization temperature and the crystallinity of non-isothermally cold-crystallized PTT-15A nanocomposites increased with increasing 15A content. The crystallinity of isothermally cold-crystallized PTT-15A nanocomposites was shown to increase with crystallization temperature and the clay content, but no clear trend in crystallinity was observed for PTT-30B nanocomposites. The combination of FTIR and DSC has been used to determine the conformational changes during isothermal cold crystallization. The results show that the crystalline gauche and amorphous gauche conformations increased and the amorphous trans conformation decreased with crystallization temperature and clay content for PTT-15A nanocomposites, whereas no trend was observed for PTT-30B nanocomposites.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3aclay fraction 3acrystal structure 3acrystallization 3adifferential scanning calorimetry 3aengineering 3ahydrophilicity 3ananocomposites 3atemperature1 aVasanthan, Nadarajah0 tIndustrial & Engineering Chemistry Research.g2015 Aug. 26, v. 54, no. 33 p.8183-8192dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-50457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.iecr.5b019133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03303naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245011400169300001600283500001500299520165600314592002801970650001901998650001102017650001402028650001802042650001402060650001602074650001302090650001702103650001702120650002202137650001202159650004402171650002602215651001102241651001202252653003102264653002002295653002902315653003402344653002702378653002502405700001802430700001702448700001802465700001802483700001902501700002002520773011502540856008502655852000902740655001202749IND60543865420221119132009.0190412e201403  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054386542DNAL7 a10.1016/j.meegid.2014.01.0232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPutkuri, Niina10aIsolation and characterization of a California encephalitis serogroup orthobunyavirus from Finnish mosquitoes  ap. 164-173.  a2019-12-06  aThe mosquito-borne California encephalitis serogroup viruses of the genus Orthobunyavirus (family Bunyaviridae) include several causative agents of encephalitis in humans. Until recently, Inkoo virus (INKV) was the only orthobunyavirus isolated in Finland, showing high seroprevalence in the population. In this study, we recovered five orthobunyavirus isolates from mosquitoes collected in eastern Finland in the early autumns of 2007 and 2008 by inoculation of Vero cells. The isolates were determined by S, M and L segment sequences to represent the California encephalitis virus species but distinct from INKV (68% polyprotein amino acid (aa) identity). In genetic analyses, isolates clustered together with a number of westernmost Chatanga virus isolates (98% polyprotein aa identity) reported from Russia, forming a distinct phylogroup. However, the sequence homology of this phylogroup to the majority of Chatanga isolates, comprising three different geographically clustered phylogroups, was considerably lower (89‚Äì92% polyprotein aa identity). The five new isolates were designated as M√∂hk√∂ isolates of Chatanga virus, according to the village of origin. The isolates were closely related to Snowshoe hare virus (SSHV) and La Crosse virus (LACV) with an aa identity of 87% and 82% within the M segment polyprotein, respectively. The genetic relatedness of M√∂hk√∂ isolates to a number of human pathogenic orthobunyaviruses warrants further investigation on their potential disease associations and further serological analysis is needed to compare them to other Chatanga virus isolates and SSHV to determine their true antigenic relation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aseroprevalence 3ahumans 3aCulicidae 3aserodiagnosis 3aserotypes 3aamino acids 3avillages 3apolyproteins 3aencephalitis 3asequence homology 3aviruses 3aCalifornia encephalitis orthobunyavirus 3agenetic relationships 3aRussia 3aFinland 0aCalifornia serogroup virus 0aOrthobunyavirus 0aSnowshoe hare virus-like 0aCalifornia encephalitis virus 0aChatanga virus isolate 0aMosquito-borne virus1 aKurkela, Satu1 aLevanov, Lev1 aHuhtamo, Eili1 aVaheri, Antti1 aSironen, Tarja1 aVapalahti, Olli0 tInfection, genetics, and evolution.g2014 Mar., v. 22 p.164-173dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12450x1567-13487nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.meegid.2014.01.0233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02282naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245011400168300001600282520102300298592002801321650001301349650000801362650001401370650001001384650002201394650002401416650001301440650003101453650001201484650001401496650002401510650000901534650000901543653002301552653001901575653001201594653001201606653001901618653002601637773008301663856008101746852000901827655001201836IND60627968420221116170538.0190128s2017    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062796842DNAL7 a10.1163/1568539X-000034422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKnotts, Eilea R.10aInfluences of individual phenotypic traits on the habitat preferences of the sand fiddler crab, Uca pugilator  ap. 741-764.  aRecognizing which phenotypic traits are predictors for habitat choice can have important implications for understanding population dynamics. This study determined whether body size, sex, activity level, or origin habitat affected the preference of the fiddler crab, Uca pugilator, in selecting either a marsh or open mudflat, two habitats differing in risk level and food availability. Combining field and laboratory experiments, this study indicated a significant difference in body size and activity level of crabs between habitats. Further investigation of phenotypic dependency on habitat preference resulted in interactions between origin habitat and carapace width and activity level. When split by origin habitat, habitat preference for the open mudflat was predicted by body size for crabs originating from the open mudflat and by activity level for the crabs originating from the Spartina marsh. These results suggest that, for U. pugilator, body size plays a large role in the preference for exposed habitat.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSpartina 3aUca 3abody size 3acrabs 3afood availability 3ahabitat preferences 3ahabitats 3alaboratory experimentation 3amarshes 3aphenotype 3apopulation dynamics 3arisk 3asand 0ahabitat preference 0acarapace width 0ahabitat 0amudflat 0aactivity level 0aSpartina alterniflora0 tBehaviour.g, v. 154, no. 7-8 p.741-764dBrillwJournal:11664x0005-79597nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1163/1568539X-000034423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02225naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002900153245009600182300001600278520131600294592002801610650001301638650002901651650001501680650001701695700002301712773011601735856008701851852000901938655001201947IND60084704820221122181507.0141101e201203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008470482DNAL7 a10.1016/j.isprsjprs.2012.01.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTopouzelis, Konstantinos10aOil spill feature selection and classification using decision tree forest on SAR image data  ap. 135-143.  aA novel oil spill feature selection and classification technique is presented, based on a forest of decision trees. The parameters of the two-class classification problem of oil spills and look-alikes are explored. The contribution to the final classification of the 25 most commonly used features in the scientific community was examined. The work is sought in the framework of a multi-objective problem, i.e. the minimization of the used input features and, at the same time, the maximization of the overall testing classification accuracy. Results showed that the optimum forest contains 70 trees and the three most important combinations contain 4, 6 and 9 features. The latter feature combination can be seen as the most appropriate solution of the decision forest study. Examination of the robustness of the above result showed that the proposed combination achieved higher classification accuracy than other well-known statistical separation indexes. Moreover, comparisons with previous findings converge on the classification accuracy (up to 84.5%) and to the number of selected features, but diverge on the actual features. This observation leads to the conclusion that there is not a single optimum feature combination; several sets of combinations exist which contain at least some critical features.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaccuracy 3adecision support systems 3aoil spills 3aspatial data1 aPsyllos, Apostolos0 tISPRS journal of photogrammetry and remote sensing.g2012 Mar., v. 68 p.135-143dElsevier B.V.x0924-27167nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.isprsjprs.2012.01.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02992naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245017100164520147900335592002801814650002201842650001401864650001901878650001001897650001501907650001201922650002801934650001101962650003201973650001902005650001602024650002402040650002202064650001302086650002502099653003702124653003302161653002502194653002102219700001402240700001802254700001502272700001702287773011502304856008202419852000902501655001202510IND60685213420221121033144.0200318e20200510xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068521342DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jep.2020.1126852doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWei, Rongrui10aIsolation and characterization of flavonoid derivatives with anti-prostate cancer and hepatoprotective activities from the flowers of Hosta plantaginea (Lam.)

Aschers (Liliaceae) is a traditional medicinal material in Mongolian medicine for treating sore throat, hoarseness, pulmonary fever, and toxic fever in folk. The present work investigated anti-prostate cancer and hepatoprotective activities of flavonoid derivatives from H. plantaginea (Lam.) Aschers.Aim of the study: To isolate and identify the chemicals of H. plantaginea (Lam.) Aschers for anti-prostate cancer and hepatoprotective activities.Active chemicals were isolated and purified from H. plantaginea (Lam.) Aschers by chromatographic methods, and their structures were established on spectroscopic analysis and references. These compounds were evaluated for their anti-prostate cancer activities using the LNCaP prostate cancer cells, and assayed for their hepatoprotective activities on CCl‚ÇÑ-induced injury of human L-O2 cells, respectively.Four new flavonol-lignan heterodimers (1‚Äì4), together with nine known flavonoid derivatives (5‚Äì13) were isolated from this plant for the first time. Among them, some compounds exhibited moderate anti-prostate cancer and hepatoprotective activities.Compounds 1, 2, 5, and 6 showed anti-prostate cancer activities using the LNCaP prostate cancer cells with IC‚ÇÖ‚ÇÄ values of 17.84, 33.26, 54.13, and 81.55¬†Œºg/mL, and compounds 3, 4, 8, and 9 exhibited moderate hepatoprotective activities, respectively.

Here we present detailed evidence of highly efficient and reversible iodine capture in hexaphenylbenzene-based conjugated microporous polymers (HCMPs), synthesized via Buchwald‚ÄìHartwig (BH) cross-coupling of a hexakis(4-bromophenyl)benzene (HBB) core and aryl diamine linkers. The HCMPs present moderate surface areas up to 430 m¬≤ g‚Äì¬π, with narrow pore size distribution and uniform ultramicropore sizes of less than 1 nm. Porous properties are controlled by the strut lengths and rigidities of linkers, while porosity and uptake properties can be tuned by changing the oxidation state of the HCMPs. The presence of a high number of amine functional groups combined with microporosity provides the HCMPs with extremely high iodine affinity with uptake capacities up to 336 wt %, which is to the best of our knowledge the highest reported to date. Two ways to release the adsorbed iodine were explored: either slow release into ethanol or quick release upon heating (with a high degree of control). Spectral studies indicate that the combination of microporosity, amine functionality, and abundant œÄ-electrons ensured well-defined host‚Äìguest interactions and controlled uptake of iodine. In addition, the HCMPs could be recycled while maintaining 90% iodine uptake capacity (up to 295%). We envisage wider application of these materials in the facile uptake and removal of unwanted oxidants from the environment.  aPublisher supplied data 3abenzene 3across-coupling reactions 3aethanol 3aiodine 3anuclear power 3aoxidants 3aoxidation 3apolymers 3aporosity 3aporous media 3aradioactive waste 3aspectral analysis1 aWeber, Jens1 aMills, Benjamin M.1 aRen, Zihao1 aFaul, Charl F.

The Effect of Operating Conditions on Process Performance  ap. 7290-7300.  aTorrefaction is suggested to be an effective method to reduce the cost of biomass provision and improve the fuel properties. In this study, both raw and torrefied Miscanthus √ó giganteus (M√óG) were gasified in an externally heated air-blown bubbling fluidized bed (BFB) gasifier using olivine as the bed material. The effects of equivalence ratio (ER) (0.18‚Äì0.32) and bed temperature (660‚Äì850 ¬∞C) on the gasification performance were investigated. Torrefied M√óG has higher energy density primarily due to a higher ratio of lignin to cellulose and hemicellulose; it has lower bulk density, smaller particle diameter and lower reactivity than the original biomass. These properties affect its performance during gasification. The cold gas efficiency was on average 12% lower for torrefied than for raw M√óG for the range of operating conditions studied. Within the same temperature range the carbon conversion was about 10% higher for raw than for torrefied biomass. The hydrogen conversion was higher for torrefied M√óG since gasification of this feedstock results in higher yields of methane and ethane and lower yields of unreacted process water. The carbon loss with char elutriated from the gasifier for torrefied M√óG was significantly higher than that of raw (5% vs 3%) and was driven by physical properties of torrefied M√óG. The results obtained suggest that chemical composition expressed as lignin to cellulose and hemicellulose ratio has a pronounced effect on carbon conversion efficiency and tar production.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMiscanthus giganteus 3abiomass 3abulk density 3acarbon 3acellulose 3achemical composition 3aenergy density 3afeedstocks 3afluidized beds 3afuels 3agasification 3ahemicellulose 3ahydrogen 3alignin 3atemperature 3atorrefaction1 aXue, Gang1 aHorvat, Alen1 aRabou, Luc P.

H.10aUnsaturated Hydraulic Conductivity Measurements with Centrifuges: A Review  ap. 531-547.  aepub  aConducting drainage or imbibition experiments in a centrifugal force field has long been recognized as a valid and efficient way to determine capillary pressure‚Äìsaturation and relative permeability‚Äìsaturation relationships. Experiments involving multiphase flow of immiscible fluids in porous media are sped up because the centrifugal acceleration is many times greater than Earth's gravitational acceleration. In addition, the fact that centrifugal force is a body force and that experiments can be performed under well-controlled conditions are considered advantages over other techniques. During the past few decades, transient-flow centrifuge methods have been developed and applied in petroleum geosciences, while in the soil and environmental sciences the focus has been on steady-state centrifuge methods. To inform both groups of each others' work, the different instrumental approaches used are described. The theoretical background for modeling multiphase fluid flow of immiscible fluids through porous media in a centrifugal force field is then reviewed. This background forms the basis for understanding analytical and numerical formulations to interpret both steady-state and transient-flow centrifuge experiments. Research on the effects of compaction, menisci deformation, boundary conditions, corrections for early-time production data, the selection of measurable variables, and nonuniqueness of the data interpretation is discussed. A numerical example application of the transient-flow centrifuge method is presented. Finally, the major conclusions that can be drawn from the literature are discussed and potential areas for future research are identified.  aPublisher supplied data 3aunsaturated conditions 3ahydraulic conductivity 3acentrifuges 3acentrifugation 3ameasurement 3aaccuracy 3acapillarity 3apermeability 3aporous media 3aimmiscible displacement 3alaboratory equipment 3aflow 3alaboratory techniques1 aPerfect, E.1 aTu, Changhe,1 aKnappett, P.

We surveyed some major studies following the principle of backward snowballing sampling on the subject considering country and panel based analyses therein for the role of energy conservations and economic sustainability. We concluded from these selected studies that 43.7% studies found evidence in favor of growth hypothesis, 50% of studies found evidence in favor of feedback hypothesis and 6% of these total studies found evidence in favor of neutrality hypothesis. The findings imply a serious caution in the implementation of energy conservation options via employing framework without introducing structural breaks. Moreover, disaggregation of energy input into its components (Oil, coal, gas or fossil and non-fossil fuels) corroborates pertinent information on the role of exports in energy-GDP nexus. Thus, overcoming the caveats of extant studies considering this survey therein proposed suggestions for improving the modeling framework may potentially become insightful to the literature on energy conservation and the way forward.  aPublisher supplied data 3acoal 3aeconomic sustainability 3aenergy 3aenergy conservation 3aoils 3asurveys 0aEnergy-GDP 0aExports 0aEnergy modeling 0aSustainability0 tEnergy.g2021 Feb. 01, v. 216 p.119280-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2020.1192803Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02274naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245007900170300001600249520093800265592002801203650001801231650002501249650003501274650001001309650001301319650001301332650001201345650001401357650001001371650001201381650001901393650001401412651001601426653001401442653001901456653001801475653001801493653002701511700002001538700002101558700002001579700002001599773008301619856008101702852000901783655001201792IND60627968720221116170537.0190128s2017    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062796872DNAL7 a10.1163/1568539X-000034452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNelson, Douglas A.10aInter-dialect dispersal is common in the Puget Sound white-crowned sparrow  ap. 809-834.  aDispersal in birds can have an important influence on the genetic structure of populations by affecting gene flow. In birds that learn their songs, dispersal can affect the ability of male birds to share songs in song dialects and may influence mate attraction. We used Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS) trace element analysis on the body feathers of birds to assess dispersal among four song dialects. We found that (1) most males had a feather element profile typical of only one dialect location; (2) males singing non-local (‚Äòforeign‚Äô) dialects in a focal population often learned their foreign songs outside the dialect; and (3) females often dispersed among dialects. We estimated 5% dispersal per year by yearling males between the site of moulting and breeding. Our estimate is consistent with genetic estimates of widespread gene flow between dialects in this subspecies of the white-crowned sparrow.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPasseriformes 3aanimal communication 3aatomic absorption spectrometry 3abirds 3abreeding 3afeathers 3afemales 3agene flow 3amales 3amolting 3atrace elements 3ayearlings 3aPuget Sound 0adispersal 0atrace elements 0asong dialects 0asong learning 0aZonotrichia leucophrys1 aNickley, Ben M.1 aPoesel, Angelika1 aGibbs, H.

The two-step kinetic experiments of ultrafine grinding (UGCS) and sieve-based grinding corn stover (SGCS) were performed respectively with enzyme loading of 2.5‚ÄØ+‚ÄØ2.5‚ÄØFPU/g and 5‚ÄØ+‚ÄØ5‚ÄØFPU/g. The different performance of these two samples were illustrated by characterizing the particle size distribution, SEM and XPS. The results showed that ultrafine grinding can promote the structural properties which is beneficial to adsorption and hydrolysis. The main factors influencing adsorption kinetics are enzyme concentration and the surface cellulose amount. Pre-adsorbed enzyme has no effects on the subsequent enzyme adsorption quantity but produces some small competitive and impeditive effects. The hydrolysis kinetics mainly depend on the structure of the substrate and its complexity of hydrolysis. The two-step hydrolysis didn‚Äôt promote the total sugar yield under the same enzyme concentration, but the first step contributed more to the total sugar yield.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aadsorption 3acellulose 3acorn stover 3agrinding 3ahydrolysis 3aparticle size distribution 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asugars 0aEnzyme adsorption 0aHydrolysis 0aTwo-step kinetics 0aUltrafine grinding1 aFan, Zhiliang1 aLi, Junbao1 aHan, Lujia1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2955-63070 tBioresource technology.g2019 June, v. 282 p.384-389dElsevier LtdaElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46263x0960-85247nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2019.03.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02338naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245009200168300001600260520106200276592002801338650002001366650001301386650001001399650002301409650001001432650001101442650001301453650001201466650001601478650002101494650002201515650000901537650002301546650001101569653003101580653002301611653002001634653002301654653001601677700001401693773008301707856008101790852000901871655001201880IND60627968820221116170557.0190128s2017    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062796882DNAL7 a10.1163/1568539X-000034462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHasegawa, Masaru10aNegative interplay of tail and throat ornaments at pair formation in male barn swallows  ap. 835-851.  aPair formation is indispensable for breeding in monogamous species, generating selection for male traits that increase the probability of pairing success. Male ornamentation is one such trait, and several empirical studies have shown the importance of each of multiple ornaments. Still, it remains unclear how multiple ornaments in combination affect the probability of pair formation. Using the Japanese barn swallow, Hirundo rustica gutturalis, we studied the interplay of two sexually selected male traits, tail length and throat coloration, during pair formation. Independent of other morphological, ornamental and abiotic variables, the probability of pair formation was predicted by the negative interplay between tail length and plumage colour saturation: males possessing more-colourful plumage with shorter tails or males possessing less-colourful plumage with longer tails had a higher probability of pair formation than others. The current findings may explain spatiotemporal variation in ornamentation and sexual selection in this model species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHirundo rustica 3abreeding 3acolor 3aempirical research 3amales 3amodels 3amonogamy 3aplumage 3aprobability 3asexual selection 3aspatial variation 3atail 3atemporal variation 3athroat 0aHirundo rustica gutturalis 0amultiple ornaments 0apairing success 0aplumage coloration 0atail length1 aArai, Emi0 tBehaviour.g, v. 154, no. 7-8 p.835-851dBrillwJournal:11664x0005-79597nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1163/1568539X-000034463Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04001naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002700148245011300175520266400288592002802952650002602980650001703006650001103023650001303034650001203047650002203059650001503081650001703096650001803113651001103131653001503142653001603157653003603173653002503209700002703234700005203261700004103313700003003354773010303384856008303487852000903570655001203579IND60769453120221119153007.0220515e202204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076945312DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agsy.2022.1033862doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTorres-Avila, Angelica10aInnovation in the pineapple value chain in Mexico: Explaining the global adoption process of the MD-2 hybrid  aScaling up innovations has emerged as an important requirement to address the challenges faced by the agricultural sector. However, current interpretations of scaling up are often too simplistic, and there is a need to integrate perspectives that capture the complexity involved in scaling up an innovation. In this context, we believe that the structural-functional approach of the innovation system can contribute to the understanding of the underlying factors that enable the successful introduction and scaling up of an innovation.¬†Our objective is to improve the understanding of how system functions and their interactions influence the introduction and scaling up of an innovation. We provide a case study that illustrates the development and scaling up of MD-2 pineapple in the world and in Mexico.¬†For the integration and analysis of the information, the event history technique, applied in various studies on innovation systems, was used. This technique consists of the identification, classification, and analysis of events according to the system functions.¬†The success of the expansion of MD-2 pineapple in the international market can be explained, to a large extent, by the fulfilment of all the system functions, which interacted positively and reinforced each other, resulting in great dynamism in the demand for this fruit. This functional pattern created entry points for other countries, once the MD-2 genotype was in the public domain and the market had appreciated its commercial potential. With these conditions in place, Mexico was also incorporated into this varietal innovation. Thus, market formation was the initial push for Mexican pineapple farmers to begin producing the MD-2 pineapple. Its exploitation involved the development of various technical changes and market-oriented activities. These changes were made possible by the fulfilment and interaction of system functions.¬†The findings of this study contribute greatly to our understanding of how an innovation develops in the context of a developing country. With the mapping of the system functions, it was possible to: (i) reconstructing innovation processes from their origin to their scaling up; (ii) understanding innovation as a process, path-dependent and influenced by multiple dimensions. Understanding each of the functions of innovation system provides information on those processes occurring within the system that require special attention. This information can be used by the scientific community together with decision and policy makers to develop more appropriate intervention strategies based on the functions that have a ripple effect on innovation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural industry 3acase studies 3afruits 3agenotype 3ahybrids 3aissues and policy 3apineapples 3asupply chain 3aworld markets 3aMexico 0ascaling up 0avalue chain 0afunctions of innovation systems 0atechnological change1 aAguilar √Åvila, Jorge,1 aSantoyo Cort√©s, V.

The lignocellulosic material was separately pretreated using i) the organic solvent N-methylmorpholine N-oxide (NMMO) at 120‚ÄØ¬∞C for 3‚ÄØh, ii) the organosolv method, employing ethanol as the organic solvent at 180‚ÄØ¬∞C for 1‚ÄØh and iii) using an alkaline pretreatment with NaOH at 30‚ÄØ¬∞C for 24‚ÄØh. All the pretreatments were effective in increasing the biomethane production yield of wheat straw. In particular, the cumulative biomethane production yield of 274‚ÄØmL CH4/g VS obtained with the untreated feedstock was enhanced by 11% by the NMMO pretreatment and by 15% by both the organosolv and alkaline pretreatment. The three pretreatment methods had a different impact on the chemical composition of the straw. NMMO hardly changed the amount of carbohydrates and lignin present in the original feedstock. Organosolv had a major impact on dissolving the hemicellulose component, whereas the alkaline pretreatment was the most effective in removing the lignin fraction. In addition to the increased biogas yields, the applied pretreatments enhanced the kinetics of biomethane production.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalkali treatment 3aanaerobic digestion 3abiogas 3achemical composition 3acrop yield 3aethanol 3afeedstocks 3ahemicellulose 3alignin 3alignocellulose 3asodium hydroxide 3asolvents 3awheat straw 0aAnaerobic digestion 0aBiogas 0aWheat straw 0aNMMO 0aOrganosolv 0aAlkaline pretreatment1 aPapirio, Stefano1 aLens, Piet N.L.1 aEsposito, Giovanni0 tRenewable energy.g2018 Apr., v. 119 p.608-614dElsevier LtdwJournal:11970x0960-14817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.renene.2017.12.0453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02541naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002500150245015600175500001900331520153500350592002801885650001101913650001301924650001601937653001901953653001901972653001701991653000802008700002702016773009002043856008502133852000902218655001202227IND60717918620221116154047.0210212e20210201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071791862DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2020.1192822doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPrasad, Rajesh Kumar10aDevelopment and comparative experimental investigations of laser plasma and spark plasma ignited hydrogen enriched compressed natural gas fueled engine  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aA customized port-fuel-injection (PFI) SI engine was operated in spark ignition (SI) and laser ignition (LI) modes at varying brake mean effective pressure (BMEP) and relative air-fuel ratio (Œª) under naturally aspirated conditions. Test fuel used were hydrogen enriched compressed natural gas (HCNG) mixtures and results were compared with baseline CNG. For H‚ÇÇ enrichment of CNG, a customized dynamic fuel mixing system was developed. For LI, a solid state Q-switched Nd:YAG laser (200¬†mJ; 30¬†Hz; 6‚Äì9 ns) was used, and the laser beam was focused using a converging lens of 50¬†mm focal length. Experiments of HCNG fueling exhibited relatively higher peak pressure (P‚Çò‚Çê‚Çì) with its peak shifted closer to the top dead center (TDC). H‚ÇÇ enrichment of CNG led to increase in peak in-cylinder P‚Çò‚Çê‚Çì (by ‚àº2.9¬†bar), RoPR (by ‚àº0.72¬†bar/deg) and HRR (by ‚àº7.2¬†kJ/m¬≥.deg) for 40HCNG compared to baseline CNG.

The lowest BSFC obtained were at Œª¬†=¬†1.2 for HCNG in SI mode, while corresponding value in LI mode was obtained at Œª¬†=¬†1.4. BSHC emissions were always lower for LI mode than the SI mode. At 3.96¬†bar BMEP, BSHC emissions reduced from 0.54¬†g/kWh (for CNG) to 0.35¬†g/kWh (for 40HCNG), which further reduced to 0.21¬†g/kWh (for H‚ÇÇ) in LI mode.

The optimal synthetic procedure of the solid desulfurizer is to pretreat AC with nitric acid (68.0 wt %) for 4 h and then impregnate the sample in a 0.02 g/mL NaHCO‚ÇÉ aqueous solution at 35 ¬∞C for 2 h. Finally, this solid adsorbent desulfurizer was calcined at 500 ¬∞C for 4 h, and referred to as NC-AC. This solid desulfurizer was used to treat Saudi Arabian crude oil with a mass ratio of 30:1 (crude oil:NC-AC) at 55 ¬∞C for 3.5 h. A desulfurization efficiency as high as 32.4 wt % was achieved with optimized NC-AC. The NC-AC samples had larger pore diameters and evenly distributed alkali leading to high desulfurization efficiency. The desulfurization mechanisms of the AC supported desulfurizer were analyzed, indicating that both physical and chemical adsorption occurred on the desulfurizer. This desulfurizer also has good performance to adsorb thiophenes, alkylthiophene, and benzothiophenes in the crude oil, and H‚ÇÇS, thioether and mercaptan in the gasoline fraction.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactivated carbon 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3aaqueous solutions 3adesulfurization 3agasoline 3ahydrogen sulfide 3anitric acid 3apetroleum 3asodium bicarbonate 3athiophenes1 aHe, Fusen1 aYu, Tian1 aHu, Mingming1 aAlshammari, Ahmed1 aZhang, Zhanquan1 aSong, Linhua1 aLiu, Dong0 tEnergy & Fuels.g2015 Nov. 19, v. 29, no. 11 p.7456-7464dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-50297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.energyfuels.5b012103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01437naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100001300138245013300151300001800284520030300302592002800605650001900633650000900652650001900661650002200680650001100702650001900713650001900732650001300751700001600764700002000780700002000800700001700820700001700837773012800854856007200982852000901054655001201063IND60657427720221117234504.0190816e20030808xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065742772DNAL7 a10.1039/b306538c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Jing12aA highly selective photooxidation approach using O‚ÇÇ in water catalyzed by iron(ii) bipyridine complex supported on NaY zeolite  ap. 2214-2215.  aA new photocatalytic system involving iron(ii) bipyridine supported on NaY zeolite (FeBY) shows excellent reactivity and selectivity in the oxidation of organic compounds.

T6SSs are a class of sophisticated cell contact‚Äêdependent apparatuses involved in mediating antagonistic or synergistic communications between bacteria and/or bacteria and eukaryotes. These apparatuses have recently been found to be widely distributed among Gram‚Äênegative bacterial species. SecReT6 offers a unique, readily explorable archive of known and putative T6SSs, and cognate effectors found in bacteria. It currently contains data on 11‚Äâ167 core T6SS components mapping to 906 T6SSs found in 498 bacterial strains representing 240 species, as well as a collection of over 600 directly relevant references. Also collated and archived were 1340 diverse candidate secreted effectors which were experimentally shown and/or predicted to be delivered by T6SSs into target eukaryotic and/or prokaryotic cells as well as 196 immunity proteins. A broad range of T6SS gene cluster detection and comparative analysis tools are readily accessible via SecReT6, which may aid identification of effectors and immunity proteins around the T6SS core components. This database will be regularly updated to ensure its ongoing maximal utility and relevance to the scientific research community.  aPublisher supplied data 3aInternet 3abacteria 3adatabases 3aeukaryotic cells 3aimmunity 3amultigene family 3aprokaryotic cells 3astrains 3atype VI secretion system1 aYao, Yufeng1 aXu, H.

The experimental water-extraction unit is designed, manufactured, and tested at the Faculty of Engineering, Mansoura University, Egypt (latitude 31.0409‚ÄØN and longitude 31.3785‚ÄØE). The unit extracts water from atmospheric air by using solar energy as the heating source and Calcium Chloride (CaCl2) solution as desiccant material. The unit consists of double-faced conical-finned absorber (64‚ÄØcm diameter and 64‚ÄØcm height), double-faced conical transparent surface (68‚ÄØcm diameter and 68‚ÄØcm height). The unit is provided with a telescopic stick (carrier), and base. At night, the conical absorber which is made from cloth layer impregnated with desiccant solution is exposed to atmospheric air to allow Calcium Chloride solution to absorb moisture. During daytime, the absorber is covered with the tightly-closed double-faced conical transparent surface which is exposed to solar radiation. As solar energy increases the absorber temperature, the absorbed vapor evaporates from the solution and condenses on the surface. The condensate is collected in a bottle through a hose. Radiation intensity, temperature, cover temperature, ambient temperature, and productivity are recorded at a number of different operating days year-round. The measured accumulated productivity is found to range from 0.3295 to 0.6310‚ÄØkg/m¬≤/day.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3aambient temperature 3acalcium chloride 3acondensates 3adesiccants 3aengineering 3alatitude 3alongitude 3asolar energy 3asolar radiation 3avapors 3aEgypt 0aWater 0aAtmospheric air 0aAbsorption 0aSolar energy 0aDew collection 0aRegeneration 0aExtraction1 aAwad, M.M.1 aZeidan, E.B.1 aHamed, A.M.0 tRenewable energy.g2018 Apr., v. 119 p.662-674dElsevier LtdwJournal:11970x0960-14817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.renene.2017.12.0503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02899naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001800153245007900171520183000250592002802080650001202108650002002120650002202140650001302162650001002175650001402185653002602199653001602225653001802241653001802259700001902277700001702296700001702313773011002330856008802440852000902528655001202537IND60685214020221121023016.0201125e202005  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068521402DNAL7 a10.1016/j.forsciint.2020.1102242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSiegert, C.C.12aA comparative assessment of consolidation materials applied to burned bone  aFire-altered or fragmentary bone presents a challenge to forensic anthropologists and bioarchaeologists due to its characteristic friability. A potential solution to this problem is the use of consolidant materials on fragile osteological material, including burned remains. Although anthropologists and odontologists employ a variety of consolidant materials, there is no consensus regarding which material is most appropriate. Four easily obtained and commonly used consolidants, Acryloid‚Ñ¢ B-72, Acrysol‚Ñ¢ WS-24, Rhoplex‚Ñ¢ B-60A, and Butvar¬Æ B-98, were compared to assess ease of material application and ability to stabilize burned bone. Each consolidant was applied to a subgroup of the study population at a 10% concentration. Total dry time per specimen, ease of solution preparation and application, and any alteration to the bone‚Äôs appearance were recorded to assess the practical use of each material in field recovery settings. Nanoindentation, drop weight impact, and forced vibration tests were then performed to assess degree of stabilization. These tests were chosen to mimic possible real-world scenarios where burned bone may undergo damage during and after recovery, including repeated handling and transportation from the fire scene to the lab. Based on both qualitative and quantitative data collected, Acryloid‚Ñ¢ B-72 is the most suitable consolidant tested to stabilize burned or fragmentary bone during recovery efforts. If the dry time for Rhoplex‚Ñ¢ B-60A could be reduced by using a different solvent, such as acetone, Rhoplex‚Ñ¢ B-60A would also be appropriate. Highly calcined areas, and targeted structures that could be utilized for positive identification, including teeth and the frontal sinus, should preferentially be consolidated with Acryloid‚Ñ¢ B-72 in the field prior to recovery.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetone 3adata collection 3aforensic sciences 3asolvents 3ateeth 3avibration 0aForensic anthropology 0aBurned bone 0aConsolidation 0aStabilization1 aHamilton, M.D.1 aErhart, E.M.1 aDevlin, J.B.0 tForensic science international.g2020 May, v. 310 p.110224-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:3523x0379-07387nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.forsciint.2020.1102243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02617naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245011100169500001900280520140800299592002801707650001201735650002201747650001401769650002301783650001101806650001301817650002401830650001601854653001601870653002301886653002101909653002101930700001601951700001801967700001801985700002002003773009002023856008502113852000902198655001202207IND60717918820221116154023.0210212e20210201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071791882DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2020.1192852doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Shuping10aCatalytic cracking of biomass tar using Ni nanoparticles embedded carbon nanofiber/porous carbon catalysts  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe major obstacles for catalytic cracking of biomass tar have been known as the low tar removal efficiency and catalyst deactivation. In view of this, the novel Ni nanoparticles embedded carbon nanofiber/porous carbon catalysts were synthesized by the method of hydrothermal treatment combined with carbothermal reduction. The properties of catalysts were evaluated by characterization of N‚ÇÇ adsorption-desorption, SEM, XRD, TEM, H‚ÇÇ-TPRand Raman, meanwhile the evolutionary mechanism of catalysts was also proposed. The tar catalytic cracking tests indicated that the Ni‚ÇÄ.‚ÇÉ‚ÇÄ@CF/PCs exhibited the favorable catalytic activity with the high tar conversion efficiency (94.78%) as well as the better catalytic stability at the catalytic cracking temperature of 700¬†¬∞C compared to other catalysts. In the case of Ni‚ÇÄ.‚ÇÉ‚ÇÄ@CF/PCs, the carbon nanofiber/porous carbon composites with hierarchical micro-mesoporous structure and high graphitization degree as well as the Ni nanoparticles embedded in catalyst support with the strong metal-support interaction exhibited the favorable activity-structure relationship. In addition, the Ni‚ÇÄ.‚ÇÉ‚ÇÄ@CF/PCs catalyst also presented the high tar conversion efficiency of 93.31% after 10 cycles, which was due to the high resistance towards coke deposition and sintering of metallic Ni covered by graphite layer from the carbothermal reduction process.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiomass 3acarbon nanofibers 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3aenergy 3agraphene 3ahot water treatment 3atemperature 0aBiomass tar 0aCatalytic cracking 0aNi nanoparticles 0aCarbon nanofiber1 aYin, Haoxin1 aWang, Jiaxing1 aZhu, Shuguang1 aXiong, Yuanquan0 tEnergy.g2021 Feb. 01, v. 216 p.119285-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2020.1192853Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02637naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245012600166300001800292520149000310592002801800650001601828650002701844650001701871650001501888650001001903650002101913650002101934650001501955650001901970650001601989700002002005700001902025700001802044773010602062856008602168852000902254655001202263IND60578224720221120132644.0170812e20160913xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057822472DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.macromol.6b009712doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBakir, Mete10aHeat-Induced Polycondensation Reaction with Self-Generated Blowing Agent Forming Aromatic Thermosetting Copolyester Foams  ap. 6489-6496.  aThis work presents a unique chemical strategy and a facile fabrication scheme toward development of novel aromatic thermosetting copolyester foams. Designed aromatic-based acetoxy and carboxylic acid end-group oligomers carry out an endothermic condensation polymerization reaction, which self-generates acetic acid blowing agent forming macrocellular porous morphology within cross-linked ester backbone polymer matrix. Herein, we provide a visual insight into the foaming reaction between the constituent oligomer groups via optical micrographs captured at polymerization phase transformation stages; oligomer melt-compounding, bubble nucleation via release of gaseous acetic acid, and subsequently bubble growth at elevated temperatures. Furthermore, we show cure and postcure characteristics of the constituent oligomers in the course of the foaming reaction that the most favorable pair of cure temperature and cure time is determined. Then, combining these outcomes, we design an optimum cure cycle and fabrication process to develop physical products of aromatic thermosetting copolyester foams. Afterward, we assess thermomechanical properties with respect to cross-linking densities and molecular weights of the aromatic thermosetting copolyester foams. Aromatic thermosetting copolyester foams offer a unique thermoset polymer system that would address needs for emerging techonologies for development of lightweight, strong, and high temperature stable innovative materials.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetic acid 3acondensation reactions 3acrosslinking 3aendothermy 3afoams 3amolecular weight 3aphase transition 3apolyesters 3apolymerization 3atemperature1 aMeyer, Jacob

The aim of this article is therefore to analyze the determinants of such strategies and their influence on firms' financial and carbon performance over time. It is argued that corporate carbon strategies have three main objectives: carbon governance, carbon reduction and carbon competitiveness. To assess the complex interactions between these strategic objectives, their determinants and outcomes, an integrative structural equation model is developed and empirically tested. Data are sourced from a global sample of 45 leading enterprises from the steel, cement and automotive sector, including some of the largest GHG emitters in the world. In order to account for the long-term impacts of strategies, the firm-level change in financial and carbon performance is calculated by comparing two different points in time, namely 2008 and 2013. The results provide empirical evidence for the positive effect of institutional and stakeholder pressure on emission reduction activities. Proof for a positive impact of carbon pressure on organizational capabilities and corporate competitiveness in the context of climate change cannot be established. Surprisingly, the results also indicate no relationship between carbon reduction activities and long-term improvements in carbon performance. However, such measures are linked to long-term financial gains. Advancements in carbon performance, in turn, are not found to be associated with economic benefits.  aPublisher supplied data 3abusiness enterprises 3acarbon 3acement 3aclimate change 3afinancial economics 3agovernance 3agreenhouse gases 3astakeholders 3asteel 3astructural equation modeling 0aClimate change mitigation 0aGHG reduction 0aBusiness strategy 0aCarbon performance 0aFinancial performance 0aStructural equation modelling1 aPaul, Arijit1 aBaumgartner, Rupert J.0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2017 Sept. 01, v. 160 p.123-138dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2017.03.2063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02715naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100003100145245010700176300001800283520144600301592002801747650002101775650003501796650002401831650002401855650001301879650000901892650002401901650001801925650002501943650001701968650002001985650001402005651002102019700003102040700002102071700002002092773010502112856007902217852000902296655001202305IND60347005420221118031946.0150812e201507  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6034700542DNAL7 a10.1111/1462-2920.127072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGodin‚ÄêRoulling, Amandine10aFunctional adaptations of the bacterial chaperone trigger factor to extreme environmental temperatures  ap. 2407-2420.  aTrigger factor (TF) is the first molecular chaperone interacting cotranslationally with virtually all nascent polypeptides synthesized by the ribosome in bacteria. Thermal adaptation of chaperone function was investigated in TFs from the Antarctic psychrophile Pseudoalteromonas haloplanktis, the mesophile Escherichia coli and the hyperthermophile Thermotoga maritima. This series covers nearly all temperatures encountered by bacteria. Although structurally homologous, these TFs display strikingly distinct properties that are related to the bacterial environmental temperature. The hyperthermophilic TF strongly binds model proteins during their folding and protects them from heat‚Äêinduced misfolding and aggregation. It decreases the folding rate and counteracts the fast folding rate imposed by high temperature. It also functions as a carrier of partially folded proteins for delivery to downstream chaperones ensuring final maturation. By contrast, the psychrophilic TF displays weak chaperone activities, showing that these functions are less important in cold conditions because protein folding, misfolding and aggregation are slowed down at low temperature. It efficiently catalyses prolyl isomerization at low temperature as a result of its increased cellular concentration rather than from an improved activity. Some chaperone properties of the mesophilic TF possibly reflect its function as a cold shock protein in E.‚Äâcoli.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aPseudoalteromonas haloplanktis 3aThermotoga maritima 3aambient temperature 3abacteria 3acold 3acold shock proteins 3aisomerization 3amolecular chaperones 3apolypeptides 3aprotein folding 3aribosomes 3aAntarctic region1 aSchmidpeter, Philipp A.

However, response to climate may be affected by inter-species interactions and local constraints, which beg the question of the effect of mixture on tree growth response under various ecological conditions. To assess these effects, climate‚Äìtree growth relationships of pure Abies alba stands were compared to those of three different mixtures: A. alba with Fagus sylvatica, with Picea abies and with both species. 151 stands (456 A. alba trees) were sampled in the Vosges mountains in north-eastern France under three contrasted climates, from low altitude and dry conditions (mean precipitation in July <85mm and altitude <600m) to high altitude and humid conditions (P July >115mm and alt. >900m). We sampled adult trees and homogeneous stand conditions to clearly assess differences in sensitivity to climate. Climate‚Äìtree growth relationships were evaluated from 12 A. alba chronologies (four mixtures√óthree climatic conditions) through pointer years and response function analyses. Late previous summer conditions and current summer soil water deficit and temperature played a major role on A. alba growth. Results showed greater sensitivity to temperature at high elevation, and to summer drought at low altitude and under dry conditions. Mixture allowed maintaining a higher level of A. alba growth during extreme climatic events and reduced A. alba response to summer drought especially under the driest contexts. Different facilitation processes may explain mixture effects such as changes in rooting depth, water input by stemflow and rainfall interception. This differentiated functioning of mixed forests highlights their importance for adapting forest management to climate change.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAbies alba 3aFagus sylvatica 3aPicea abies 3aaltitude 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3adrought 3aforest management 3agrowth rings 3amixed forests 3amixed stands 3amountains 3apure stands 3arain 3asoil water deficit 3asummer 3atree growth 3atrees 3awater temperature 3aFrance 0aMixed stand 0aAbies alba 0aTree-ring 0aClimate‚Äìtree growth relationships 0aTemperate forests 0aDrought1 aGomez, N.1 aPinto, P.1 aM√©rian, P.0 tForest ecology and management.g2013 Sept. 01, v. 303 p.61-71dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl9013x0378-11277nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2013.04.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03816naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245010200171300001600273520227900289592002802568650002102596650002802617650001402645650001002659650002702669650003202696650003202728650001402760650001502774650002402789650001402813653001302827653001002840653001002850653000702860653000802867653000902875653001702884653002202901653002102923653003902944653003202983653003203015700001603047700002603063773011503089856008503204852000903289655001203298IND60543866620221119132011.0190412e201506  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054386662DNAL7 a10.1016/j.meegid.2015.03.0312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMukherjee, Sumit10aElucidating evolutionary features and functional implications of orphan genes in Leishmania major  ap. 330-337.  aOrphan genes are protein coding genes that lack recognizable homologs in other organisms. These genes were reported to comprise a considerable fraction of coding regions in all sequenced genomes and thought to be allied with organism‚Äôs lineage-specific traits. However, their evolutionary persistence and functional significance still remain elusive. Due to lack of homologs with the host genome and for their probable lineage-specific functional roles, orphan gene product of pathogenic protozoan might be considered as the possible therapeutic targets. Leishmania major is an important parasitic protozoan of the genus Leishmania that is associated with the disease cutaneous leishmaniasis. Therefore, evolutionary and functional characterization of orphan genes in this organism may help in understanding the factors prevailing pathogen evolution and parasitic adaptation. In this study, we systematically identified orphan genes of L. major and employed several in silico analyses for understanding their evolutionary and functional attributes. To trace the signatures of molecular evolution, we compared their evolutionary rate with non-orphan genes. In agreement with prior observations, here we noticed that orphan genes evolve at a higher rate as compared to non-orphan genes. Lower sequence conservation of orphan genes was previously attributed solely due to their younger gene age. However, here we observed that together with gene age, a number of genomic (like expression level, GC content, variation in codon usage) and proteomic factors (like protein length, intrinsic disorder content, hydropathicity) could independently modulate their evolutionary rate. We considered the interplay of all these factors and analyzed their relative contribution on protein evolutionary rate by regression analysis. On the functional level, we observed that orphan genes are associated with regulatory, growth factor and transport related processes. Moreover, these genes were found to be enriched with various types of interaction and trafficking motifs, implying their possible involvement in host‚Äìparasite interactions. Thus, our comprehensive analysis of L. major orphan genes provided evidence for their extensive roles in host‚Äìpathogen interactions and virulence.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLeishmania major 3acutaneous leishmaniasis 3aevolution 3agenes 3agermplasm conservation 3ahost-parasite relationships 3ahost-pathogen relationships 3apathogens 3aproteomics 3aregression analysis 3avirulence 0aL. major 0aBLAST 0aGRAVY 0aNc 0aCAI 0aFPKM 0aOrphan genes 0aEvolutionary rate 0aProtein disorder 0aInteraction and trafficking motifs 0aHost‚Äìparasite interaction 0aLineage-specific adaptation1 aPanda, Arup1 aGhosh, Tapash Chandra0 tInfection, genetics, and evolution.g2015 June, v. 32 p.330-337dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12450x1567-13487nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.meegid.2015.03.0313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03026naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245006600171300001400237520176300251592002802014650002602042650001302068650002502081650001102106650001802117650001002135650001502145650001002160650001102170650002702181650001402208650001902222650003002241653001402271653001302285653001402298653001402312653002702326700002002353773011302373856008502486852000902571655001202580IND60543866720221119131922.0190412e201404  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054386672DNAL7 a10.1016/j.meegid.2014.01.0292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNunes, Alexandra10aEvolution, phylogeny, and molecular epidemiology of Chlamydia  ap. 49-64.  aThe Chlamydiaceae are a family of obligate intracellular bacteria characterized by a unique biphasic developmental cycle. It encompasses the single genus Chlamydia, which involves nine species that affect a wide range of vertebral hosts, causing infections with serious impact on human health (mainly due to Chlamydia trachomatis infections) and on farming and veterinary industries. It is believed that Chlamydiales originated ‚àº700mya, whereas C. trachomatis likely split from the other Chlamydiaceae during the last 6mya. This corresponds to the emergence of modern human lineages, with the first descriptions of chlamydial infections as ancient as four millennia. Chlamydiaceae have undergone a massive genome reduction, on behalf of the deletional bias ‚Äúuse it or lose it‚Äù, stabilizing at 1‚Äì1.2Mb and keeping a striking genome synteny. Their phylogeny reveals species segregation according to biological properties, with huge differences in terms of host range, tissue tropism, and disease outcomes. Genome differences rely on the occurrence of mutations in the >700 orthologous genes, as well as on events of recombination, gene loss, inversion, and paralogous expansion, affecting both a hypervariable region named the plasticity zone, and genes essentially encoding polymorphic and transmembrane head membrane proteins, type III secretion effectors and some metabolic pathways. Procedures for molecular typing are still not consensual but have allowed the knowledge of molecular epidemiology patterns for some species as well as the identification of outbreaks and emergence of successful clones for C. trachomatis. This manuscript intends to provide a comprehensive review on the evolution, phylogeny, and molecular epidemiology of Chlamydia.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChlamydia trachomatis 3abacteria 3abiochemical pathways 3aclones 3agene deletion 3agenes 3ahost range 3ahosts 3ahumans 3amolecular epidemiology 3aphylogeny 3atissue tropism 3atype III secretion system 0aChlamydia 0aTaxonomy 0aEvolution 0aPhylogeny 0aMolecular epidemiology1 aGomes, Jo√£o P.0 tInfection, genetics, and evolution.g2014 Apr., v. 23 p.49-64dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12450x1567-13487nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.meegid.2014.01.0293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02321naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005600150245010500206300001600311520106600327592002801393650002301421650002801444650001101472650001701483650001101500650001101511650000901522650001601531650001501547650001501562653003601577653003701613653001501650653001501665700002001680700002001700773009701720856008501817852000901902655001201911IND60591213720221119100618.0190321e201807  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059121372DNAL7 a10.1016/j.renene.2017.12.1002doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBruck, Maira1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0209-198112aA Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE) model for wind farms that include Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs)  ap. 131-139.  aThe Cost of Energy is a major concern for the electric power industry. Customers are sensitive to the cost of renewable energy, which is typically more expensive than conventional energy generation due to the variability and uncertainty associated with their sources. Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) are developed to balance the energy price and associated risks with poewr gerneation and transmission. The energy delivery limits imposed by current PPAs impact the Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE) in ways that are not accomodated by existing LCOE models. In this work, a new cost model is developed to evaluate the LCOE from a wind power source under a PPA contract. The application of the model to real wind farms demonstrates that the actual LCOE depends on the defined minimum/maximum energy purchase limitations within a PPA contract. The developed cost model can be used as a basis for setting appropriate PPA terms, such as a price schedule and performance metrics. Hence, it can help the Seller to negotiate penalties and energy price within their PPAs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aconsumers (people) 3aelectric power industry 3aenergy 3aenergy costs 3amodels 3aprices 3arisk 3auncertainty 3awind farms 3awind power 0aLevelized cost of energy (LCOE) 0aPower purchase agreements (PPAs) 0aWind farms 0aCost model1 aSandborn, Peter1 aGoudarzi, Navid0 tRenewable energy.g2018 July, v. 122 p.131-139dElsevier LtdwJournal:11970x0960-14817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.renene.2017.12.1003Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02787naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002700147245011500174520147000289592002801759650001001787650001401797650002401811650001801835650002601853650001101879650002201890650002301912650002301935653002301958653002501981653002302006653003102029700003302060700004302093700002702136700001602163773010702179856008202286852000902368655001202377IND60685214520221121023051.0201024e202005  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068521452DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcs.2020.1029382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCayres, Caroline Alves10aConsumers‚Äô acceptance of optimized gluten-free sorghum-based cakes and their drivers of liking and disliking  aSensory analysis is indispensable in order to promote the project of developing sorghum-based products and, therefore, work on sensory profiles of these products and consumer acceptance is needed to help them succeed. Thus, this study investigated the acceptance of 5 optimized gluten-free sorghum-based and a Reference (with gluten) cakes (prepared from cake premixes), considering their drivers of liking and disliking and their purchase intention. Chocolate and orange flavored gluten-free cakes were prepared based on the numerical optimizations of the formulations (technological, nutritional, functional, technological and nutritional, and technological and functional optimizations). Three sensory evaluation techniques were applied to cakes: acceptance testing, purchase intention and Check-all-that-apply. There was an improvement in the sensory properties of the gluten-free samples in which the nutritional or functional characteristics were optimized together with the technological characteristics, resulting in higher acceptances. It was confirmed that sensory studies are indispensable to confront the challenge of developing sorghum-based foods with sensory characteristics desired by consumers. Therefore, it is concluded that it was possible to offer a gluten-free cake premix that presents good sensory quality, having the potential to be offered as a novelty by the food industry, given that most consumers stated that they did not know sorghum.  aPublisher supplied data 3acakes 3achocolate 3aconsumer acceptance 3afood industry 3afunctional properties 3agluten 3agluten-free foods 3asensory evaluation 3asensory properties 0aSensory evaluation 0aCheck-all-that-apply 0aPurchase intention 0aPregelatinized blend flour1 aRam√≠rez Ascheri, Jos√© Luis1 aPeixoto Gimenes Couto, Maria Antonieta1 aAlmeida, Eveline Lopes1 aMelo, Lauro0 tJournal of cereal science.g2020 May, v. 93 p.102938-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46803x0733-52107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcs.2020.1029383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02838naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245013300170300001800303520160900321592002801930650001101958650001601969650002001985650003102005650001902036650001202055650001002067650002302077650001102100650001902111650001502130651001402145651002302159700002102182700002002203700002302223773012202246856005102368852000902419655001202428IND50088054820221119050309.0140412e20130920xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008805482DNAL7 a10.1080/01431161.2013.8006592doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLeon, Javier X.10aFilling the ‚Äòwhite ribbon‚Äô ‚Äì a multisource seamless digital elevation model for Lizard Island, northern Great Barrier Reef  ap. 6337-6354.  aHydrographers have traditionally referred to the nearshore area as the ‚Äòwhite ribbon‚Äô area due to the challenges associated with the collection of elevation data (elevation hereafter refers to both topography and bathymetry) in this highly dynamic transitional zone between terrestrial and marine environments. Accordingly, available information in this zone is typically characterized by a range of data sets from disparate sources. In this article, we propose a framework to fill the white ribbon area of a coral reef system by integrating multiple elevation data sets acquired by a suite of remote-sensing technologies into a seamless digital elevation model (DEM). A range of data sets are integrated, including field-collected global positioning system (GPS) elevation points, topographic and bathymetric light detecting and ranging (lidar), single and multibeam echosoundings, nautical charts, and bathymetry derived from optical remote-sensing imagery. The proposed framework ranks data reliability internally, thereby avoiding the requirements to quantify absolute error and results in a high-resolution, seamless product. Nested within this approach is an effective spatially explicit technique for improving the accuracy of bathymetry estimates derived empirically from optical satellite imagery through modelling the spatial structure of residuals. The approach was applied to data collected on and around Lizard Island in northern Australia. Collectively, the framework holds promise for filling the white ribbon zone in coastal areas characterized by similar data availability scenarios.  aPublisher supplied data 3acoasts 3acoral reefs 3adata collection 3aglobal positioning systems 3aimage analysis 3aislands 3alidar 3amarine environment 3amodels 3aremote sensing 3atopography 3aAustralia 3aGreat Barrier Reef1 aPhinn, Stuart R.1 aHamylton, Sarah1 aSaunders, Megan I.0 tInternational journal of remote sensing.g2013 Sept. 20, v. 34, no. 18 p.6337-6354dTaylor & Francisx1366-59017nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01431161.2013.800659  aDNAL 7aarticle03256naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002200151245013000173300001600303520193300319592002802252650002002280650001402300650001202314650001302326650001702339650001302356650001202369650001102381650001502392650001302407650001402420650001502434650001602449653002102465653001402486653002002500653001302520653001102533700002002544700002602564773011302590856008602703852000902789655001202798IND60567698120221119094105.0180831e20170710xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056769812DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2017.03.2352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStimilli, Arianna10aWarm recycling of flexible pavements: Effectiveness of Warm Mix Asphalt additives on modified bitumen and mixture performance  ap. 911-922.  aIn pavement industry, environmental and economical sustainability stimulates technical solutions able to drastically decrease pollutants and energy costs caused by high production temperatures. In this sense, recent research efforts focused on innovative technologies able to significantly reduce mixing and compaction temperature. The so called Warm Mix Asphalts (WMA) are bituminous mixtures produced at reduced temperatures through specific additives based on different mechanisms. The novelty of WMA technologies determines a lack of experience about their effectiveness, which requires dedicated research activities, especially when polymer modified bitumens and Reclaimed Asphalt Pavement (RAP) are used.Given this context, the present study proposes a comprehensive laboratory investigation on dense-graded mixtures produced through different WMA additives representative of the main categories currently available on the market (i.e. chemical, organic and water-based). Mixtures were prepared including Styrene-Butadiene-Styrene polymer modified bitumen and 25% of RAP to evaluate potential benefits deriving from the combination of warm and recycling techniques. For a complete understanding of WMA additive effects, mechanical tests (i.e. compactability, stiffness, fatigue) carried out on mixtures in a broad range of loading configurations were integrated by rheological analyses on bitumens.Results indicate that lower production temperatures allowed a significant decrease in stiffness, effectively balancing the inclusion of RAP material without penalizing mixture performance. Compactability, volumetric and fracture properties indicate the possibility to produce suitable recycled warm mixtures when the appropriate WMA additive is selected. The chemical additive appeared able to provide overall improved performance, whereas the organic additive made the mixture brittle and susceptible to permanent cracking.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadditive effect 3aadditives 3abitumen 3acracking 3aenergy costs 3aindustry 3amarkets 3amixing 3apollutants 3apolymers 3arecycling 3atechnology 3atemperature 0aWarm Mix Asphalt 0aRecycling 0aAsphalt mixture 0aEmission 0aBinder1 aVirgili, Amedeo1 aCanestrari, Francesco0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2017 July 10, v. 156 p.911-922dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2017.03.2353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02495naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001700153245005400170300001600224520159200240592002801832650001501860650001401875650002001889650001901909650001001928700002401938700001901962773011601981856008702097852000902184655001202193IND60084705920221122225240.0141101e201204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008470592DNAL7 a10.1016/j.isprsjprs.2012.02.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Caixia10aSpatial content-based scene similarity assessment  ap. 103-120.  aScene comparison and matching is a fundamental operation in geoinformatics. However, existing solutions are rather inadequate to support scene similarity assessment when comparing datasets collected from diverse sources especially ones that are available in diverse modalities (e.g. comparing image to vector datasets), or represent different time instances and thus differ partially in their content. In this paper we introduce a two-stage scene similarity assessment and matching framework that makes use of spatial scene content to compare and match two scenes as they may be captured in two different datasets (e.g. an aerial image and a map). At first stage our approach makes use of a matching algorithm based on the comparison of attributed graphs, where linear feature networks (e.g. road networks) are transformed into graphs and network properties are expressed through graph-embedded invariant attributes. By matching these graphs we can assess the similarity between two scenes. At the second stage, we proceed with an invariant scene comparison metric that incorporates additional scene content in the form of object configurations present within individual road network loops (e.g. building arrangements within city squares). By combining diverse but co-located pieces of information (e.g. roads and buildings) in an integrated process, our algorithm supports scene comparison and matching even when comparing heterogeneous datasets. In this paper we present key theoretical concepts and provide experimental results to demonstrate the performance of the proposed approach.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3abuildings 3adata collection 3aremote sensing 3aroads1 aStefanidis, Anthony1 aAgouris, Peggy0 tISPRS journal of photogrammetry and remote sensing.g2012 Apr., v. 69 p.103-120dElsevier B.V.x0924-27167nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.isprsjprs.2012.02.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03027naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100001600154245009600170520136300266592002801629650001701657650001201674650001801686650002201704650001101726650002301737650002001760650001201780650001701792650001501809650002801824650001901852650001901871650002201890650001901912650001101931653001901942653001401961653001601975653001601991653001202007653001702019653002102036653000902057653000802066653000902074653000802083653000802091653000902099653000702108653000802115653000902123653000802132700001202140700001802152700001302170773010802183856008902291852000902380655001202389IND60685214620221121023027.0200405e202005  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068521462DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biotechadv.2020.1075352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Ya-Jun10aConsolidated bio-saccharification: Leading lignocellulose bioconversion into the real world  aLignocellulosic biomass is the most abundant sustainable carbon source on the planet and has enormous potential to substitute fossil resources on the premise of cost-effective conversion. Efforts have been made to develop various lignocellulosic bioconversion strategies to overcome biomass recalcitrance, promote product conversion efficiency and reduce process cost. Consolidated bio-saccharification (CBS), a consolidated bioprocessing (CBP) derived strategy, is herein proposed for lignocellulose bioconversion by integrating enzyme production and hydrolysis steps but separating fermentation from the integrated process. This strategy employs cellulosome-producing microorganisms as a biocatalyst to enhance lignocellulose solubilization and produces lignocellulose-derived fermentable sugars as a platform product for fermentations aiming at various products. The success of CBS depends on robust biocatalysts with high activity, suitable pretreatments for efficient delignification, and downstream fermentations with process compatibility. The review introduces the updated progress on lignocellulose bioconversion following the CBS route, discusses key factors for optimization of the CBS process, and, more importantly, highlights challenges and promising solutions for the CBS strategy in the industrial application of lignocellulose bioconversion.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiocatalysts 3abiomass 3abioprocessing 3abiotransformation 3acarbon 3acost effectiveness 3adelignification 3aenzymes 3afermentation 3ahydrolysis 3aindustrial applications 3alignocellulose 3amicroorganisms 3amineral resources 3asolubilization 3asugars 0aŒ≤-glucosidase 0acellulase 0acellulosome 0aClostridium 0aglucose 0apretreatment 0asaccharification 0aAFEX 0aBGL 0aBSES 0aCBP 0aCBS 0aCELF 0aCT 0aSHF 0aSSCF 0aSSF1 aLi, Bin1 aFeng, Yingang1 aCui, Qiu0 tBiotechnology advances.g2020 May,  June, v. 40 p.107535-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:6288x0734-97507nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biotechadv.2020.1075353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02589naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100001400138245011300152300001600265520152500281592002801806650002501834650002601859650001101885650001901896650001501915650002001930650001201950650001201962650001201974700002001986700001602006700001502022773010902037856007202146852000902218655001202227IND60081453420221120070359.0140908e201409  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008145342DNAL7 a10.1002/rra.27002doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAnker, Y.10aApplication of aerial digital photography for macrophyte cover and composition survey in small rural streams  ap. 925-937.  aMacrophytes are a key biological component in many fluvial ecosystems. In altered streams, they can become highly dominant features, covering extensive parts of the channel with cascading effects on stream conditions and biological composition. The aim of this study is to examine the possibility of using information collected by aerial digital photography‚Äêspectral analysis (ADP‚ÄêSA) as an alternative, cost‚Äêeffective methodology to the commonly used spectral procedure at a large (section) scale, and to the ground level visual survey (gridded frame) at a smaller (organism) scale. Cladophora glomerata and Nasturtium officinale, were selected as the targeted macrophyte species and classified at the same time (species relative cover) by using the three methodologies. Our findings show that the ADP‚ÄêSA methodology was able to detect species and relative cover in similar accuracy (‚â§10% differences) at the two spatial scales. ADP‚ÄêSA had a better spatial resolution than both the hyperspectral and the visual methodology (4‚Äâcm vs. 1‚Äâm and 10‚Äâcm, respectively) and was capable to differentiate submerged from emergent plants. However, on a smaller scale, ground level work is suitable and essential for detecting rarer species and is not hindered by weather, canopy cover or multi‚Äêlayered plant composition. ADP‚ÄêSA can therefore add a cost‚Äêeffective and nonsubjective practice to the existing tool kit of macrophyte surveys, particularly in small streams, which require high spatial resolution.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCladophora glomerata 3aNasturtium officinale 3acanopy 3adigital images 3aecosystems 3aemergent plants 3astreams 3asurveys 3aweather1 aHershkovitz, Y.1 aBen Dor, E.1 aGasith, A.0 tRiver research and applications.g2014 Sept., v. 30, no. 7 p.925-937dJohn Wiley & Sonsx1535-14597nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/rra.27003Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02352naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245007600165300001400241520103900255592002801294650001001322650001401332650001401346650001801360650000901378650001101387650001301398650001801411650001101429650001101440650002401451650001201475650003701487650001101524653001901535653003301554653002201587653003601609653003901645700001901684773010001703856008201803852000901885655001201894IND60599129220221118055132.0180702e201406  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059912922DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcat.2014.04.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSerna, Pedro12aA residue-free production of biaryls using supported gold nanoparticles  ap. 41-47.  aSmall gold nanoparticles in the presence of O2 are able to cleave CH bonds of non-activated arenes and facilitate catalytic formation of biaryls under mild conditions. This procedure avoids the common requirement of iodine, acids, bases, and/or other stoichiometrical additives to accomplish multiple turnovers and results in a zero-waste synthetic process. A number of unactivated arenes such as benzene, toluene, p-xylene, nitrobenzene, chlorobenzene, or phenol are selectively converted to the corresponding biaryls, with accumulated turnover numbers greater than 600. Kinetic measurements, in combination with IR, HRTEM, and STEM-HAADF data, suggest that the reaction takes place on gold atoms that are metallic in character, with the highest CC bond formation rate provided by gold nanoparticles of approximately 3nm of diameter. A radical-free reaction mechanism is postulated on the basis of the kinetic measurements. The results represent a first stone for the waste-free preparation of biaryls using supported gold catalysts.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacids 3aadditives 3acatalysts 3achlorobenzene 3agold 3aiodine 3ananogold 3anitrobenzenes 3aoxygen 3aphenol 3areaction mechanisms 3atoluene 3atransmission electron microscopy 3axylene 0aGold catalysis 0aSupported gold nanoparticles 0aCC bond formation 0aWaste-free formation of biaryls 0aActivation of non-activated arenes1 aCorma, Avelino0 tJournal of catalysis.g2014 June, v. 315 p.41-47dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11700x0021-95177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcat.2014.04.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01791naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002200140245012800162300001800290520048800308592002800796650001100824650001400835650002000849650002400869650002100893650002500914650001600939700001500955700001700970700001500987700002001002700002201022700002001044700001901064700001501083700001601098700001601114700002001130773012401150856007401274852000901348655001201357IND60663132120221118034020.0190909e20150512xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066313212DNAL7 a10.1039/c5gc00047e2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCherepanov, P.

The highest formation rate (19.8Œºmolgcat‚Åª¬πmin‚Åª¬π) of desired products (acrylic acid+methyl acrylate) was accomplished over a VPO catalyst comprising mainly vanadyl pyrophosphate ((VO)2P2O7) and vanadyl phosphate in Œ¥ form (Œ¥-VOPO4). This catalyst is nearly three times more active than the analogue reported in literature. The VPO catalyst activated in 1.5% butane‚Äìair is superior to that activated in air or nitrogen. Different from the PEG-derived VPO catalysts for n-butane oxidation to maleic anhydride, a better VPO catalyst for the current reaction requires a higher fraction of Œ¥-VOPO4 entity and contains the medium strong acid sites of high density. Through systematic catalyst characterizations and evaluations, an unambiguous correlation between catalyst structure/constitution and performance was established.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetates 3aacrylic acid 3aair 3abutanes 3acatalysts 3acondensation reactions 3aformaldehyde 3amaleic anhydrides 3anitrogen 3aoxidation 3aoxides 3aphosphates 0aAcetic acid 0aMethyl acetate 0aFormaldehyde 0aAldol condensation 0aAcrylic acid 0aVanadium phosphorus oxide1 aSun, Bo1 aYao, Yao1 aSu, Qin1 aJi, Weijie1 aAu, Chak-Tong0 tJournal of catalysis.g2014 May, v. 314 p.132-141dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11700x0021-95177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcat.2014.04.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04220naa a2200649 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005800150245018100208300001500389520206800404592002802472650001802500650002302518650002902541650001902570650001902589650002302608650002802631650001902659650004202678650001602720650001502736650001502751650001002766650002702776650001802803650001102821650001802832650001302850650001802863650001602881650002002897653001802917653002402935653002502959653001902984653003103003653002003034700002103054700001603075700001803091700001903109700002103128700001403149700005903163700005703222700006603279700002303345773009603368856008503464852000903549655001203558IND60629025220221119045931.0191024e20190401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062902522DNAL7 a10.1016/j.watres.2019.01.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZamyadi, Arash1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0598-889010aDiagnosing water treatment critical control points for cyanobacterial removal: Exploring benefits of combined microscopy, next-generation sequencing, and cell integrity methods  ap. 96-105.  aA wide range of cyanobacterial species and their harmful metabolites are increasingly detected in water bodies worldwide, exacerbated by climate change and human activities. The resulting bloom conditions represent significant challenges to production of safe drinking water and cost effective water reuse, therefore their removal is a priority to ensure public safety. While current microscopic taxonomy identification methods provide valuable information about cell numbers during treatment, these methods are incapable of providing information about the fate of cells during treatment. The objectives of this study were to (1) identify the critical control points for breakthrough and accumulation of cells by investigating the fate of cells during treatment processes using a combination of taxonomy, cell integrity and next-generation sequencing (NGS), and (2) assess the impact of pre-treatment processes on breakthrough prevention at critical control points, and the benefits of cell integrity and NGS analysis for improved management purposes. This paper presents the results of an unprecedented cyanobacterial monitoring program conducted in four full scale water treatment plants located in three different climate zones. Cyanobacterial cell integrity and accumulation during operation process were assessed for the first time using next generation of gene sequencing methods. NGS analysis led to detection of cyanobacterial and melainabacteria orders in water samples that were not identified by microscopy. 80‚ÄØ¬±‚ÄØ5% of cells were completely lysed post pre-oxidation (for both ozone and potassium permanganate). However unlike pre-ozonation, the remaining cells were undamaged cells with the potential to accumulate and grow within the plants post-KMnO4 treatment, particularly in clarifier sludge. To effectively monitor water quality, this study presents a synergistic approach coupling new and traditional analytical methods and demonstrates the importance of identifying critical points for managing accumulation of cyanobacteria within plants.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCyanobacteria 3aanalytical methods 3aanthropogenic activities 3aclimate change 3aclimatic zones 3acost effectiveness 3acritical control points 3adrinking water 3ahigh-throughput nucleotide sequencing 3ametabolites 3amicroscopy 3amonitoring 3aozone 3apotassium permanganate 3apublic safety 3asludge 3asurface water 3ataxonomy 3awater quality 3awater reuse 3awater treatment 0aCyanobacteria 0aHarmful metabolites 0aMicroscopic taxonomy 0aCell integrity 0aNext-generation sequencing 0aWater treatment1 aRomanis, Caitlin1 aMills, Toby1 aNeilan, Brett1 aChoo, Florence1 aCoral, Lucila A.1 aGale, Deb1 aNewcombe, Gayle1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9825-45561 aCrosbie, Nick1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0319-42481 aStuetz, R.q(Richard),1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5259-30881 aHenderson, Rita K.0 tWater research.g2019 Apr. 01, v. 152 p.96-105dElsevier LtdwJournal:1966x0043-13547nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2019.01.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03518naa a2200673 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002900151245011500180300001600295520165900311592002801970650002001998650002302018650002302041650001102064650001902075650002702094650002002121650001802141650001202159650002302171650001302194650001802207650001302225650001802238650002102256650001902277650001102296650001302307650002002320650002502340650002002365651001102385653000702396653000702403653000602410653000702416653000702423653000702430653000802437653002602445653002002471653001902491653001302510653001502523653001602538700001802554700002602572700001902598700001702617773010302634856008602737852000902823655001202832IND60537948720221117192129.0190408e201512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053794872DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecoleng.2015.09.0812doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBateganya, Najib Lukooya10aCarbon and nitrogen gaseous fluxes from subsurface flow wetland buffer strips at mesocosm scale in East Africa  ap. 173-184.  aThis study investigated carbon (CH4, CO2) and nitrogen (N2O) gaseous fluxes as finger prints for microbial wastewater treatment processes in vertical (VF) and horizontal (HF) subsurface flow mesocosms, planted with Cyperus papyrus and operated under batch hydraulic loading. The closed chamber method was used to measure gaseous emissions for 12 weeks (April‚ÄìJune 2014) in Kampala, Uganda. Organic matter (OM) (BOD5 and COD) and inorganic nitrogen (NH4+ and NO3‚àí) nutrient concentrations were monitored to estimate OM degradation rates and potential nitrification and denitrification. The highest mean CH4 flux (mg CH4Cm‚àí2h‚àí1) was 38.3¬±3.3 in unplanted HF compared to the lowest (3.3¬±0.4) established in planted VF mesocosms. CO2 fluxes (mg CO2Cm‚àí2h‚àí1) were significantly higher (P<0.05) in planted mesocosms, with no significant difference (P>0.05) between the planted HF (2213.5¬±122.4) and VF (2272.8¬±191.0) mesocosms. The high CO2 flux was attributed to efficient degradation of the inflow organic carbon facilitated by sufficient oxygen supply especially in the planted mesocosms. Although N2O flux was relatively higher in HF mesocosms, it did not vary significantly (P>0.05) in all treatments. Generally the results indicated significant nitrification, especially in the planted mesocosms. However, high fluxes of N2O comparable to other denitrifying CWs suggested potential for coupled nitrification and denitrification in these systems. Overall, compared to CH4 and N2O, CO2 was found to be the most significant gaseous flux under induced aerobic conditions enhanced by use of C. papyrus plants and an intermittent loading regime.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCyperus papyrus 3aaerobic conditions 3aammonium compounds 3acarbon 3acarbon dioxide 3achemical oxygen demand 3adenitrification 3agas emissions 3amethane 3amethane production 3anitrates 3anitrification 3anitrogen 3anitrous oxide 3anutrient content 3aorganic matter 3aoxygen 3aplanting 3asubsurface flow 3awastewater treatment 3awetland buffers 3aUganda 0aDO 0aEF 0aF 0aHF 0aVF 0aOM 0aWBS 0aWetland buffer strips 0aSubsurface flow 0aOrganic matter 0aNitrogen 0aGas fluxes 0aEast Africa1 aMentler, Axel1 aLangergraber, Guenter1 aBusulwa, Henry1 aHein, Thomas0 tEcological engineering.g2015 Dec., v. 85 p.173-184dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11630x0925-85747nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoleng.2015.09.0813Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03025naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245012000165300001400285520175900299592002802058650001802086650001002104650001402114650001402128650001702142650004202159650000902201650002202210650001302232653002202245653001302267653001802280653002202298653001502320653002502335700002102360700002002381700001502401773008502416856008102501852000902582655001202591IND60546143520221119074124.0160903e20140106xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054614352DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tox.2013.11.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Fangfang10aSingle high-dose dexamethasone and sodium salicylate failed to attenuate phosgene-induced acute lung injury in rats  ap. 17-23.  aLife-threatening acute lung injury potentially occurs following high-level accidental exposures to phosgene gas. This situation was mirrored in rats exposed nose-only at 900‚Äì1000mg phosgene/m3min. At this exposure level, previous studies on rats demonstrated sustained reflexively induced cardiopulmonary dysfunction and evidence of vascular fluid redistribution. These findings challenge the currently applied treatment strategies to mitigate the presumed non-cardiogenic lung edema by steroidal or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. This study investigates whether high doses of curatively administered dexamethasone (DX; 100mg/kg bw, ip) and sodium salicylate (SS; 200mg/kg bw, ip), alone or in combination, show efficacy to mitigate the phosgene-induced lung edema. Exhaled nitric oxide (eNO), animal morbidity and mortality, and increased lung weights one day postexposure served as endpoints of lung injury and drug efficacy. When applying this dosing regimen, SS showed minimal (if any) efficacy while DX, alone or in combination with SS, substantially aggravated the emerging lung edema (lung weights) with 40% mortality. The degree of acute lung injury (ALI) was mirrored by increased eNO. Its direct relationship to ALI-severity was evidenced by decreased eNO following NO-synthetase inhibitor administration (aminoguanidine-aerosol) and associated mitigation of ALI. All non-treated phosgene-exposed as well as treated but non-phosgene-exposed rats survived. This experimental evidence suggests that high-dose corticoid treatments may aggravate the pulmonary toxicity of phosgene. Similarly, this outcome supports the supposition that non-inflammatory, cardiogenic and/or neurogenic factors play a role in this type of acute lung injury.  aPublisher supplied data 3adexamethasone 3aedema 3amorbidity 3amortality 3anitric oxide 3anonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents 3arats 3asodium salicylate 3atoxicity 0aAcute lung injury 0aPhosgene 0aDexamethasone 0aSodium salicylate 0aLung edema 0aExhaled nitric oxide1 aPauluhn, J√ºrgen1 aTr√ºbel, Hubert1 aWang, Chen0 tToxicology.g2014 Jan. 06, v. 315 p.17-23dElsevier Ireland Ltdx0300-483X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tox.2013.11.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02203naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002000164245010100184300001600285520089900301592002801200650001501228650001701243650001301260650001201273650001501285650002101300650002601321650001501347650001101362650001101373650002501384650003101409650002801440650002401468650003801492700002401530700002101554773010401575856008101679852000901760655001201769IND4480305620221121210437.0141110e201204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448030562DNAL7 a224804292pmid7 a10.1016/j.pbi.2012.03.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEric Schranz, M10aAncient whole genome duplications, novelty and diversification: the WGD Radiation Lag-Time Model  ap. 147-153.  aMany large and economically important plant groups (e.g. Brassicaceae, Poaceae, Asteraceae, Fabaceae and Solanaceae) have had ancient whole genome duplications (WGDs) occurring near or at the time of their origins, suggesting that WGD contributed to the origin of novel key traits and drove species diversification. However, these large clades show phylogenetic asymmetries with a species-rich crown group and a species-poor sister clade, suggesting significant ‚Äòlag-times‚Äô between WGDs and radiations. The species-poor sister groups share many key traits, but are often restricted to the hypothesized center of origin for the larger clade. Thus, the ultimate success of the crown group does not only involve the WGD and novel key traits, but largely subsequent evolutionary phenomena including later migration events, changing environmental conditions and/or differential extinction rates.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAsteraceae 3aBrassicaceae 3aFabaceae 3aPoaceae 3aSolanaceae 3acenter of origin 3aenvironmental factors 3aextinction 3agenome 3amodels 2aEvolution, Molecular 2aGene Duplicationxgenetics 2aGenome, Plantxgenetics 2aModels, Theoretical 2aPlantsxclassificationxgenetics.1 aMohammadin, Setareh1 aEdger, Patrick P0 tCurrent opinion in plant biology.g2012 Apr., v. 15, no. 2 p.147-153dElsevier Ltdx1369-52667nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.pbi.2012.03.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02191naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001500140245012300155300001800278520100600296592002801302650001901330650001201349650001401361650002101375650001101396650002001407650001801427650001701445650002601462650001101488700001901499700001601518700001901534700001501553700001801568773012401586856007401710852000901784655001201793IND60663132320221118034009.0190909e20150407xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066313232DNAL7 a10.1039/c5gc00062a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKong, Xiao10aRational design of Ni-based catalysts derived from hydrotalcite for selective hydrogenation of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural  ap. 2504-2514.  aSelective hydrogenation of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) is of great importance for future energy and chemical supply. Herein, we propose for the first time that non-noble Ni-Al‚ÇÇO‚ÇÉ catalysts derived from hydrotalcite-like compounds can efficiently and selectively convert HMF into 2,5-dimethylfuran (DMF), 2,5-dimethyltetrahydrofuran (DMTHF) and 2,5-dihydroxymethyltetrahydrofuran (DHMTHF). Homogeneous elemental distributions of the hydrotalcite-like precursor facilitate good dispersion of Ni and Al‚ÇÇO‚ÇÉ species and strong interaction between them over the resulting catalysts. The catalysts therefore exhibited superior reactivity. Through fine modulation of surface metal‚Äìacid bifunctional sites and control of reaction conditions, high yields of DMF (91.5%), DMTHF (97.4%) and DHMTHF (96.2%) can be diversely achieved. The results demonstrate the feasibility of Ni catalysts for selective hydrogenation of CÓÄÅO, CÓÄÅC and C‚ÄìO bonds, which have great potential for biomass utilization.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaluminum oxide 3abiomass 3acatalysts 3achemical bonding 3aenergy 3agreen chemistry 3ahydrogenation 3ahydrotalcite 3ahydroxymethylfurfural 3anickel1 aZheng, Runxiao1 aZhu, Yifeng1 aDing, Guoqiang1 aZhu, Yulei1 aLi, Yong-Wang0 tGreen chemistry.g2015 Apr. 7, v. 17, no. 4 p.2504-2514dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26906x1463-92707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c5gc00062a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03783naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100002200137245006200159300001800221500001500239520233900254592002802593650001402621650001602635650002402651650001402675650001002689650001702699650002502716650001802741650001602759650002402775650001302799650001102812650001602823650001502839650001902854650001202873650001402885650001002899650002702909650001302936651001802949653001802967700001802985700001903003700002203022700001903044773009803063856007103161852000903232655001203241IND60518968720221116190346.0160419e199606  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051896872DNAL7 a10.2307/22655752doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWaser, Nikolas M.10aGeneralization in Pollination Systems, and Why it Matters  ap. 1043-1060.  a2019-12-06  aOne view of pollination systems is that they tend toward specialization. This view is implicit in many discussions of angiosperm evolution and plant‚Äîpollinator coevolution and in the long‚Äîstanding concept of ‚Çöollination syndromes. But actual pollination systems often are more generalized and dynamic than these traditions might suggest. To illustrate the range of specialization and generalization in pollinators' use of plants and vice versa, we draw on studies of two floras in the United States, and of members of several plant families and solitary bee genera. We also summarize a recent study of one local flora which suggests that, although the colors of flowers are aggregated in ‚Çöhenotype space, there is no strong association with pollinator types as pollination syndromes would predict. That moderate to substantial generalization often occurs is not surprising on theoretical grounds. Plant generalization is predicted by a simple model as long as temporal and spatial variance in pollinator quality is appreciable, different pollinator species do not fluctuate in unison, and they are similar in their pollination effectiveness. Pollinator generalization is predicted when floral rewards are similar across plant species, travel is costly, constraints of behavior and morphology are minor, and/or pollinator lifespan is long relative to flowering of individual plant species. Recognizing that pollination systems often are generalized has important implications. In ecological predictions of plant reproductive success and population dynamics it is useful to widen the focus beyond flower visitors within the correct" pollination syndrome, and to recognize temporal and spatial fluidity of interactions. Behavioral studies of pollinator foraging choices and information‚Äîprocessing abilities will benefit from understanding the selective advantages of generalization. In studies of floral adaptation, microevolution, and plant speciation one should recognize that selection and gene flow vary in time and space and that the contribution of pollinators to reproductive isolation of plant species may be overstated. In conservation biology, generalized pollination systems imply resilience to linked extinctions, but also the possibility for introduced generalists to displace natives with a net loss of diversity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aflowering 3apollinators 3apopulation dynamics 3alongevity 3aflora 3aAngiospermae 3areproductive success 3asolitary bees 3acoevolution 3awildlife management 3avariance 3amodels 3apollination 3aprediction 3aspace and time 3aflowers 3agene flow 3acolor 3areproductive isolation 3aforaging 3aUnited States 0aMagnoliophyta1 aChittka, Lars1 aPrice, Mary V.1 aWilliams, Neal M.1 aOllerton, Jeff0 tEcology.g1996 June, v. 77, no. 4 p.1043-1060dEcological Society of Americax0012-96587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2307/22655753Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02486naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100001600166245009800182300001600280520096000296592002801256650001801284650001401302650001401316650001401330650002801344650001801372650002101390650001301411650002501424650001201449650002601461650001901487650002801506650003701534650003101571650001701602650002301619650002601642650002801668650004101696700002301737700001701760773012501777856008101902852000901983655001201992IND60081454320221121051105.0151123e201410  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008145432DNAL7 a248454252pmid7 a10.1007/s00128-014-1295-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, Ki-Tae10aAcute and Chronic Response of Daphnia magna Exposed to TiO2 Nanoparticles in Agitation System  ap. 456-460.  aAquatic toxicity of titanium dioxide nanoparticles (TiO‚ÇÇ NPs) to Daphnia magna was characterized using a completely stirred bioassay system intended to keep particles in suspension thereby maintaining a consistent exposure. The 48-h LC‚ÇÖ‚ÇÄ was 4.5¬†mg/L TiO‚ÇÇ NPs, whereas LC‚ÇÖ‚ÇÄ values for 7 and 14-days exposures were 2.7 and 1.9¬†mg/L, respectively.

While reproduction was initially reduced in the 0.5 and 1.0¬†mg/L exposures, it recovered and was similar to the control by 21¬†days. For reproduction inhibition, NOEC was 1.0¬†mg/L. Exposure to 2.5¬†mg/L TiO‚ÇÇ NPs resulted in 40¬†% of the organisms failing to become gravid; all surviving organisms exposed to 5.0¬†mg/L failed to become gravid. The increased sensitivity was due to the refinement in the bioassay system that kept NP in suspension resulting in consistent exposure concentrations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDaphnia magna 3aagitation 3abioassays 3afecundity 3alethal concentration 50 3ananoparticles 3atitanium dioxide 3atoxicity 2aAnalysis of Variance 2aAnimals 2aDaphniaxdrug effects 2aLethal Dose 50 2aNanoparticlesxtoxicity 2aNo-Observed-Adverse-Effect Level 2aReproductionxdrug effects 2aTime Factors 2aTitaniumxtoxicity 2aToxicity Tests, Acute 2aToxicity Tests, Chronic 2aWater Pollutants, Chemicalxtoxicity1 aKlaine, Stephen J.1 aKim, Sang D.0 tBulletin of environmental contamination and toxicology.g2014 Oct., v. 93, no. 4 p.456-460dSpringer USx0007-48617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00128-014-1295-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02655naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100002800137245009400165300001600259520125600275592002801531650003301559650002201592650002301614650001701637650002501654650002201679650002501701650002401726650001401750650001001764650002201774650001301796650001101809650001401820650001901834650002401853650001801877650001401895700002101909700002201930700002201952700002301974773009601997856007102093852000902164655001202173IND60518968820221121025851.0160419e199606  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051896882DNAL7 a10.2307/22655692doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlexander, Helen Miller10aPopulation Dynamics and Genetics of Plant Disease: A Case Study of Anther‚Äê Smut Disease  ap. 990-996.  aA model by Levin and Udovic (1977) emphasizes the need for integration of studies of the numerical abundances and genetic composition of host and pathogen species. We use their conceptual framework to summarize our collaborative research on the ecological genetics of the anther‚Äîsmut disease of Silene alba caused by the fungus Ustilago violacea. Our theoretical investigations have revealed the importance of the rate and mode of disease transmission on the likelihood of coexistence between host and pathogen. Our empirical studies have quantified patterns of disease spread on local and regional spatial scales and have shown that host genotypes differ greatly in resistance. Comparable genetic variation in pathogen virulence has not yet been demonstrated. The genetic composition of host populations alters numerical dynamics in experimental populations: disease declines in resistant populations, while host and pathogen appear to coexist in susceptible populations. Ecological outcomes also may be affected by the negative relationship between disease incidence and host flowering time, which may constitute a cost to resistance. We are currently expanding our work on the ecology and genetics of metapopulation dynamics of host and pathogen.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSilene latifolia subsp. alba 3aUstilago violacea 3aat-risk population 3acase studies 3acooperative research 3adisease incidence 3adisease transmission 3aecological genetics 3aflowering 3afungi 3agenetic variation 3agenotype 3amodels 3apathogens 3aplant genetics 3apopulation dynamics 3asmut diseases 3avirulence1 aThrall, Peter H.1 aAntonovics, Janis1 aJarosz, Andrew M.1 aOudemans, Peter V.0 tEcology.g1996 June, v. 77, no. 4 p.990-996dEcological Society of Americax0012-96587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2307/22655693Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03170naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245016100167300001600328520181100344592002802155650002102183650002502204650002502229650001902254650002002273650002602293650001302319650002202332650002302354650001602377650001102393650001002404650001202414650001402426700001702440700002202457700002902479700002502508773011302533856008102646852000902727655001202736IND60438559720221120231608.0151023e200503  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6043855972DNAL7 a10.1007/s00253-004-1765-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aErnst, Marianne10aEnantioselective reduction of carbonyl compounds by whole-cell biotransformation, combining a formate dehydrogenase and a (R)-specific alcohol dehydrogenase  ap. 629-634.  aA whole-cell biotransformation system for the reduction of prochiral carbonyl compounds, such as methyl acetoacetate, to chiral hydroxy acid derivatives [methyl (R)-3-hydroxy butanoate] was developed in Escherichia coli by construction of a recombinant oxidation/reduction cycle. Alcohol dehydrogenase from Lactobacillus brevis catalyzes a highly regioselective and enantioselective reduction of several ketones or keto acid derivatives to chiral alcohols or hydroxy acid esters. The adh gene encoding for the alcohol dehydrogenase of L. brevis was expressed in E. coli. As expected, whole cells of the recombinant strain produced only low quantities of methyl (R)-3-hydroxy butanoate from the substrate methyl acetoacetate. Therefore, the fdh gene from Mycobacterium vaccae N10, encoding NAD‚Å∫-dependent formate dehydrogenase, was functionally coexpressed. The resulting two-fold recombinant strain exhibited an in vitro catalytic alcohol dehydrogenase activity of 6.5 units mg‚Åª¬π protein in reducing methyl acetoacetate to methyl (R)-3-hydroxy butanoate with NADPH as the cofactor and 0.7 units mg‚Åª¬π protein with NADH. The in vitro formate dehydrogenase activity was 1.3 units mg‚Åª¬π protein. Whole resting cells of this strain catalyzed the formation of 40 mM methyl (R)-3-hydroxy butanoate from methyl acetoacetate. The product yield was 100 mol% at a productivity of 200 Œºmol g‚Åª¬π (cell dry weight) min‚Åª¬π. In the presence of formate, the intracellular [NADH]/[NAD‚Å∫] ratio of the cells increased seven-fold. Thus, the functional overexpression of alcohol dehydrogenase in the presence of formate dehydrogenase was sufficient to enable and sustain the desired reduction reaction via the relatively low specific activity of alcohol dehydrogenase with NADH, instead of NADPH, as a cofactor.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aLactobacillus brevis 3aMycobacterium vaccae 3aNAD (coenzyme) 3aNADP (coenzyme) 3aalcohol dehydrogenase 3aalcohols 3abiotransformation 3acarbonyl compounds 3aenantiomers 3aesters 3agenes 3aketones 3aoxidation1 aKaup, Bj√∂rn1 aM√ºller, Michael,1 aBringer-Meyer, Stephanie1 aSahm, H.q(Hermann),0 tApplied microbiology and biotechnology.g2005 Mar., v. 66, no. 6 p.629-634dSpringer-Verlagx0175-75987nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00253-004-1765-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02632naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245009900170300001800269520106500287592002801352650000901380650002101389650002801410650001401438650000901452650001501461650002301476650001701499650002101516650001501537650002201552650004401574650002401618650005801642650001301700653002701713653001501740653001601755653001601771700001901787700001901806700002001825700002001845700001801865700002001883700001801903773008701921856008502008852000902093655001202102IND60554086520221117163612.0161024e201406  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055408652DNAL7 a10.1016/j.procbio.2014.03.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKwon, Hyuck-Ju10aIsolation and identification of an anticancer compound from the bark of Acer tegmentosum Maxim  ap. 1032-1039.  aIn this study, we investigated the anticancer activity of a newly isolated compound from Acer tegmentosum Maxim (ATM) in HepG2 cells. This compound was isolated by reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) in a butanol-soluble fraction, which was shown to have the strongest anticancer activity. The isolated compound was identified as salidroside using multiple nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) techniques, including 1H, 13C, correlated spectroscopy (COSY), heteronuclear single quantum coherence (HSQC), and heteronuclear multiple bond correlation (HMBC), as well as electrospray ionization mass spectroscopy (ESI/MS). The activity of salidroside was evaluated in HepG2 cells by analyzing cell proliferation, cell cycle distribution, Hoechst 33342 staining, and Western blots of apoptotic regulatory proteins. The results show that salidroside, an anticancer compound from ATM, exhibits strong apoptotic activity in HepG2 cells. Therefore, ATM extracts could be used as chemotherapeutic agent to induce apoptosis in hepatoblastoma cells.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcer 3aWestern blotting 3aantineoplastic activity 3aapoptosis 3abark 3acell cycle 3acell proliferation 3adrug therapy 3ahuman cell lines 3aionization 3amass spectrometry 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aregulatory proteins 3areversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography 3astaining 0aAcer tegmentosum Maxim 0aAnticancer 0aSalidroside 0aHepG2 cells1 aKim, Y≈èn-suk,1 aHwang, Jin-Woo1 aKim, Chul Young1 aLee, Sang-hoon,1 aMoon, Sang-Ho1 aJeon, Byong-Tae1 aPark, Pyo-Jam0 tProcess Biochemistry.g2014 June, v. 49 p.1032-1039dElsevier Ltdx1359-51137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.procbio.2014.03.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02327naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002600148245013300174300001400307520090100321592002801222650001401250650001201264650001101276650002601287650001801313650001401331650001101345650001301356650001301369650001601382653002401398653003801422653002701460653002901487653002801516700002501544700001601569700002101585700002701606700001401633700001901647773010001666856008201766852000901848655001201857IND60599129920221118055254.0180702e201406  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059912992DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcat.2014.04.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSiankevich, Sviatlana12aA novel platinum nanocatalyst for the oxidation of 5-Hydroxymethylfurfural into 2,5-Furandicarboxylic acid under mild conditions  ap. 67-74.  a5-Hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) is a key intermediate obtainable from various cellulosic (biomass) derivatives, but it must be converted to other chemicals such as 2,5-Furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA) for direct use.

Subsequent manipulation of the nanoparticle surface via the introduction of an ionic polymer stabilizer afforded Pt nanoparticles that catalyze the transformation of HMF to FDCA under mild conditions in the absence of additives.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadditives 3abiomass 3aenergy 3ahydroxymethylfurfural 3ananoparticles 3aoxidation 3aoxygen 3aplatinum 3apolymers 3astabilizers 0aOxidation catalysis 0a2,5-Furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA) 0aPlatinum nanoparticles 0aIonic polymer stabilizer 0aBiomass transformations1 aSavoglidis, Georgios1 aFei, Zhaofu1 aLaurenczy, Gabor1 aAlexander, Duncan T.L.1 aYan, Ning1 aDyson, Paul J.0 tJournal of catalysis.g2014 June, v. 315 p.67-74dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11700x0021-95177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcat.2014.04.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02767naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245010600172300001600278520139200294592002801686650002001714650002101734650001501755650001101770650001701781650002301798650001401821650001001835650001901845650001801864650001601882650001301898653001501911653002001926653002501946653002001971653001901991653002202010653002502032700001902057700002302076773010302099856008602202852000902288655001202297IND60537949320221117191907.0190408e201512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053794932DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecoleng.2015.10.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aV√©gv√°ri, Zsolt14aThe role of phylogeny and life history of migratory waterbirds in designing fishpond management plans  ap. 288-295.  aThe acceleration of wetland loss on a global scale has frequently been reported in the past decades which is in correspondence with serious declines of migratory waterbirds. Indeed, the spatial distribution of waterbirds during migration has been shown to be associated with various predictors, ranging from feeding behaviours and migratory strategies to physical attributes of wetlands and spatial effects related to human disturbance. These results demonstrate that different constraints of ecology and life history may shape the effects of human disturbance on migratory water bird populations. In this work we analyse the role of ecological predictors and life history traits in shaping avian responsiveness to spatial attributes of artificial constructions in a phylogenetic context, using an extensive dataset of migratory water birds in Hortob√°gy, one of the most important stop-over sites in a major Afro-Eurasian flyway. Our study revealed that response to human disturbance factors such as the density and distance of public roads on larger spatial scales is predominantly related to life-history predictors such as the age of maturity, migration strategy and constrained by phylogenetic relatedness. Therefore we recommend that phylogenetic relatedness and life-history traits are considered when designing management plans for larger water bodies used by staging waterbirds.  aPublisher supplied data 3adata collection 3afeeding behavior 3afish ponds 3ahumans 3alife history 3amigratory behavior 3aphylogeny 3aroads 3astopover sites 3asurface water 3awater birds 3awetlands 0aHortob√°gy 0aFishpond system 0aPhylogenetic control 0aModel selection 0aBird migration 0aHuman disturbance 0aWetland conservation1 aBorza, S√°ndor1 aJuh√°sz, Krisztina0 tEcological engineering.g2015 Dec., v. 85 p.288-295dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11630x0925-85747nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoleng.2015.10.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01972naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024004000113040001800153100002300171245007700194300001600271520067400287592002800961650001700989650002401006650000901030650001301039650003401052650002301086650003801109650004001147650003101187650002501218650002301243650001301266650002701279650001701306700002501323700001901348773008801367856008601455852000901541655001201550IND50060310820221121155226.0141110e201212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006031082DNAL7 a230730982pmid7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2012.09.0432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDhar, Bipro Ranjan10aInfluence of iron on sulfide inhibition in dark biohydrogen fermentation  ap. 123-130.  aSulfide impact on biohydrogen production using dark fermentation of glucose at 37¬∞C was investigated.

AMP genes were fused to a heat-resistant CL7 tag using the SLOPE method, and cloned into Escherichia coli and Pichia pastoris expression vectors. Twenty E. coli and ten P. pastoris expression vectors were constructed. Expression supernatants were heated, heteroproteins were removed, and fusion proteins were purified by nickel affinity (Ni-NTA) chromatography. Fusion proteins were digested on the column using human rhinovirus (HRV) 3C protease, and AMPs were released and further purified. Five AMPs (1, 2, 6, 13, 16) were purified using the E. coli expression system, and one AMP (13) was purified using the P. pastoris expression system. Inhibition zone and minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) tests confirmed that one P. pastoris¬¨-derived and two E. coli-derived AMPs have the inhibition activity. The MIC of AMP 13 and 16 from E. coli was 24.2 ŒºM, and the MIC of AMP 13 from P. pastoris was 8.1 ŒºM. The combination of prokaryotic and eukaryotic expression systems expands the universality of the developed method, facilitating screening of a large number of biologically active AMPs, establishing an AMP library, and producing AMPs by industrialised biological methods.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aHuman rhinovirus 3aKomagataella pastoris 3aantimicrobial peptides 3achromatography 3aindustrialization 3aminimum inhibitory concentration 3anickel 3aproteinases1 aLi, Zhongchen 1 aLi, Li 1 aRao, Ben 1 aMa, Lixin 1 aWang, Yaping 0 tMicroorganisms.g2021 Sept. 01, v. 9, no. 9dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27145x2076-26077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/microorganisms90918583Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03894naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001400140245007400154520270400228592002802932650002102960650001802981650002202999650001603021650001603037650002103053650002703074650000903101650001203110650001103122651001003133700002003143700001803163700002003181700001403201700001903215700001603234700001703250773012203267856007403389852000903463655001203472IND60745554620221119230405.0210723e20210628xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074555462DNAL7 a10.3390/nu130722192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDing, Ye 10aWater Intake in Pregnant Women in China, 2018: The Report of a Survey  aBackground: Adequate water intake in pregnant women plays an important role in their health and in fetal growth and development. However, there is insufficient applicable data to guide and evaluate the water intake of pregnant women in China. Based on a nationwide sample of pregnant women, we mainly aimed to investigate the daily total water intake (TWI) and the contribution of different beverages and food sources to the TWI, to assess the percentage of participants who comply with the adequate intake (AI) value of water set by the Chinese Nutrition Society (CNS) and the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) and to analyze the contribution of different water sources to the daily total energy intake (TEI). Methods: A multi-stage sampling method was used to recruit pregnant women from 11 provinces and two municipalities in China. A 4-day online diary with a food atlas was used to assess water and dietary intake. Finally, 653 pregnant women were included in the analysis. The Mann‚ÄìWhitney U test and the independent-sample t-test were used to compare the differences between related variables in different age groups or different gestational periods, and partial correlation was used to explore the correlation between water and energy intake. Results: The median daily TWI of pregnant women was 2190 mL, of which water from beverages and foods accounted for 52.9% and 47.1%, respectively. Approximately 80.5% of the water from beverages was mainly from plain water (r = 0.973), while in the part of the water from foods, dishes (32.4%) were the main contributors (r = 0.663). Only 16.4% and 43.8% of the total population met the TWI recommendation set by the CNS and EFSA, respectively. Among these, the contribution of the water from beverages was higher than that of the water from food. For those whose TWI did not reach the recommended level, the contribution of the water from beverages was almost equal to that of food. The median daily TEI of pregnant women was 1589 kcal, of which beverages accounted for 9.7%. Milk and milk derivatives (71.3%) were the main contributors to energy from beverages, accounting for 71.3% (r = 0.444). Although sugar-sweetened drinks only accounted for 10.1% of the energy from beverages, they were highly correlated with energy from beverages (r = 0.836). Through grouping analysis, age and gestational period had no significant effect on the above main results. Conclusions: This was the beginning of a nationwide study on the TWI of pregnant women in China, and the results provide evidence of the need for interventions to improve water intake among pregnant women and the revision of reference values for AI of TWI in pregnant women in China.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAdequate Intakes 3aenergy intake 3afetal development 3afood intake 3afood safety 3agestation period 3agrowth and development 3amilk 3asurveys 3at-test 3aChina1 aXie, Zhencheng 1 aLu, Xiaolong 1 aLuo, Hongliang 1 aPan, Han 1 aLin, Xiaofang 1 aWu, Jieshu 1 aWang, Zhixu 0 tNutrients.g2021 June 28, v. 13, no. 7dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2271x2072-66437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu130722193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03700naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002600092040001800118100002500136245009200161300001600253500001500269520212900284592002802413650002102441650002802462650002102490650001202511650001702523650002602540650001102566650001702577650002602594650001202620650002502632650001302657650001102670650001602681650002302697650001502720650002402735651001502759653002402774653001202798653001402810653002202824653002202846653001902868653002002887653002002907773014802927856007403075852000903149655001203158IND4419197920221119162711.0151126e200803  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441919792DNAL7 a10.2111/07-010.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aParmenter, Robert R.10aLong-Term Effects of a Summer Fire on Desert Grassland Plant Demographics in New Mexico  ap. 156-168.  a2019-12-06  aPlant demographic responses to an experimental summer fire were monitored for 12 yr on the Sevilleta National Wildlife Refuge, New Mexico, to determine recovery rates of burned plants and evaluate fire effectiveness in preventing shrub invasion of desert grasslands. Fourteen common species of grasses, shrubs, yucca, and cacti were measured for mortality, resprouting, regrowth, herbivory, and reproduction. After the first postfire growing season, black grama (Bouteloua eriopoda [[Torr.]] Torr.) declined 80%% in size, whereas blue grama (Bouteloua gracilis [[Willd. ex Kunth]] Lag. ex Griffiths) exhibited no decline. Linear regression indicated that B. eriopoda needed 11 yr to recover. Spike dropseed (Sporobolus contractus A.S. Hitchc.) and purple three-awn (Aristida purpurea Nutt.) showed postfire declines in plant sizes, requiring 4- and > 5-yr recovery times, respectively. Sand muhly (Muhlenbergia arenicola Buckl.) exhibited no fire impact. Snakeweed (Gutierrezia sarothrae [[Pursh]] Britt. & Rusby) sustained 61%% fire mortality and reduction in regrowth canopy size. Creosotebush (Larrea tridentata [[Sesse & Moc. ex DC.]] Coville) had 12%% mortality, but survivors recovered over 12 yr. Fourwing saltbush (Atriplex canescens [[Pursh]] Nutt.) sustained 62%% mortality, but recovered plant size in 5‚Äì‚Äì6 yr. Winterfat (Krascheninnikovia lanata [[Pursh]] A. D. J. Meeuse & Smit) suffered 7%% mortality, but required 9++ yr to recover. Pale desert-thorn (Lycium pallidum Miers) survived fire, recovering prefire canopy size in 3 yr. Torrey joint-fir (Ephedra torreyana Watson) exhibited < 1%% mortality, and recovered in 2‚Äì‚Äì3 yr. Soapweed yucca (Yucca glauca Nutt.) had < 2%% mortality, recovered plant sizes in 2 yr, and increased numbers of rosettes 17%%. Chollas (Opuntia imbricata [[Haw.]] DC. and Opuntia clavata Engelm.) suffered high mortality rates and required > 12 yr recovery times. Results demonstrated that summer fire may counter some shrub and cacti invasion in central New Mexico, but once shrubs mature, fire is less effective in removing woody plants to restore southwestern grasslands.  aPublisher supplied data 3arange management 3ainterspecific variation 3ainvasive species 3agrasses 3aplant growth 3along term experiments 3ashrubs 3afire ecology 3abotanical composition 3adeserts 3acacti and succulents 3aregrowth 3asummer 3awoody weeds 3aprescribed burning 3agrasslands 3apopulation dynamics 3aNew Mexico 0aspecies differences 0agrazing 0aherbivory 0arange restoration 0aspecies diversity 0ashrub invasion 0adesertification 0aprescribed fire0 tRangeland ecology & management.g2008 Mar., v. 61, no. 2 p.156-168dThe Society for the Experimental Analysis of Behavior, Incx1551-50287nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2111%2F07-010.13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02759naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245010500167300001800272520121500290592002801505650001701533650001201550650001001562650001401572650002001586650002001606650002601626650001401652653000801666653000801674653000801682653000801690653000801698653000801706653000801714653001101722653000801733653000901741653001701750653002101767653002001788653002001808700002001828700001801848700001801866700001901884700001601903700001701919700001801936700001601954700001801970773008701988856008502075852000902160655001202169IND60554087120221117163615.0161024e201407  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055408712DNAL7 a10.1016/j.procbio.2014.03.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Xiaohua10aAccumulation of anthocyanin and related genes expression during the development of cabbage seedlings  ap. 1084-1091.  aIn this study, we investigated anthocyanin accumulation and gene expression in response to light and dark conditions during the development of white and red cabbage seedlings. Two-day-old white cabbage seedlings expressed the highest transcript level for most of the genes under light conditions. Red cabbage also showed higher expression under light than under dark conditions, although gene expression (evaluated based on transcript levels normalized to that of a housekeeping gene) in 2-day-old red cabbage sprouts was much lower than that in the corresponding white cabbage sprouts. Trends in anthocyanin accumulation were similar for red and white cabbage but much greater accumulation was observed in red cabbage. Anthocyanin levels were higher in seedlings grown under light conditions compared to those grown under dark conditions for both cabbage cultivars. Especially, red cabbage accumulated 1.94‚Äì4.05 times greater total anthocyanin in 4-, 6-, 8-, and 10-day-old seedlings, when compared to white cabbage cultivar under light/dark and dark conditions. Our findings can improve understanding of the effects of light on accumulation of secondary metabolites in the seedling stages of various crops.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanthocyanins 3acabbage 3acrops 3acultivars 3aessential genes 3agene expression 3asecondary metabolites 3aseedlings 0aPAL 0aC4H 0aCHI 0aCHS 0a4CL 0aDFR 0aF3H 0aF3‚Ä≤H 0aANS 0aUFGT 0aAnthocyanins 0aCabbage seedling 0aGene expression 0aLight treatment1 aUddin, Md Romij1 aPark, Woo Tae1 aKim, Yeon Bok1 aSeo, Jeong Min1 aKim, Sun-Ju1 aNou, Ill-Sup1 aLee, Jeongyeo1 aKim, HyeRan1 aPark, Sang Un0 tProcess Biochemistry.g2014 July, v. 49 p.1084-1091dElsevier Ltdx1359-51137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.procbio.2014.03.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02569naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002400149245010400173300001600277520136400293592002801657650001901685650001201704650002301716650001601739650001801755650001001773650001101783650001301794650002901807650001401836650001201850653002101862653001301883653001701896653002301913653002001936700002101956773007801977856008302055852000902138655001202147IND60546144520221119074010.0160903e201406  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054614452DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enpol.2014.01.0402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMir Artigues, Pere,10aCombining tariffs, investment subsidies and soft loans in a renewable electricity deployment policy  ap. 430-442.  aPolicy combinations and interactions have received a considerable attention in the climate and energy policy realm. However, virtually no attention has been paid to the analysis of the combination of different deployment instruments for the same renewable energy technology. This neglect is all the more striking given the existence in current policy practice of combinations of deployment instruments either across technologies or for the same technology, both in the EU and elsewhere. What renewable electricity support policies to use and, therefore, how to combine them in order to promote the deployment of renewable energy technologies cost-effectively is a main concern of governments. The aim of this paper is to provide insight on the cost-effectiveness of combinations of deployment instruments for the same technology. A financial model is developed for this purpose, whereby feed-in tariffs (FITs) are combined with investment subsidies and soft loans. The results show that the policy costs of combinations are the same as for the FITs-only option. Therefore, combining deployment instruments is not a cost-containment strategy. However, combinations may lead to different inter-temporal distributions of the same amount of policy costs and, thus, differently affect the social acceptability and political feasibility of renewable energy support.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEuropean Union 3aclimate 3acost effectiveness 3aelectricity 3aenergy policy 3aloans 3amodels 3apolitics 3arenewable energy sources 3asubsidies 3atariffs 0aRenewable energy 0aPolicies 0aCombinations 0aCost-effectiveness 0aFeed-in tariffs1 aR√≠o, Pablo del,0 tEnergy Policy.g2014 June, v. 69 p.430-442dElsevier Ltdx0301-42157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enpol.2014.01.0403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03576naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245022400171300001600395520184300411592002802254650002702282650002102309650001602330650001502346650001302361650001702374650002202391650002002413650002002433650002502453650001402478650001002492650002002502650001302522650001602535653001702551653002802568653001802596653004202614653002502656700002402681700002602705700001802731700002102749700002402770700006102794773009702855856008502952852000903037655001203046IND60629026120221119015518.0191024e20190401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062902612DNAL7 a10.1016/j.watres.2018.12.0622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChuang, Yi-Hsueh10aPilot-scale comparison of microfiltration/reverse osmosis and ozone/biological activated carbon with UV/hydrogen peroxide or UV/free chlorine AOP treatment for controlling disinfection byproducts during wastewater reuse  ap. 215-225.  aOzone and biological activated carbon (O3/BAC) is being considered as an alternative advanced treatment process to microfiltration and reverse osmosis (MF/RO) for the potable reuse of municipal wastewater. Similarly, the UV/free chlorine (UV/HOCl) advanced oxidation process (AOP) is being considered as an alternative to the UV/hydrogen peroxide (UV/H2O2) AOP. This study compared the performance of these alternative treatment processes for controlling N-nitrosamines and chloramine-reactive N-nitrosamine and halogenated disinfection byproduct (DBP) precursors during parallel, pilot-scale treatment of tertiary municipal wastewater effluent. O3/BAC outperformed MF/RO for controlling N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA), while MF/RO was more effective for controlling N-nitrosomorpholine (NMOR) and chloramine-reactive NDMA precursors. The UV/H2O2 and UV/HOCl AOPs were equally effective for controlling N-nitrosamines in O3/BAC effluent, but UV/HOCl was less effective for controlling NDMA in MF/RO effluent, likely due to the promotion of dichloramine under these conditions. MF/RO was more effective than O3/BAC for controlling chloramine-reactive halogenated DBP precursors on both a mass and toxicity-weighted basis. UV/H2O2 AOP treatment was more effective at controlling the toxicity-weighted chloramine-reactive DBP precursors for most halogenated DBP classes by preferentially degrading the more toxic brominated species. However, the total toxicity-weighted DBP precursor concentrations were similar for treatment by either AOP because UV/H2O2 AOP treatment promoted the formation of iodoacetic acid, which exhibits a very high toxic potency. The combined O3/BAC/MF/RO train was the most effective for controlling N-nitrosamines and the total toxicity-weighted DBP precursor concentrations with or without treatment by either AOP.  aPublisher supplied data 3aN-nitrosodimethylamine 3aactivated carbon 3abromination 3abyproducts 3achlorine 3adisinfection 3ahydrogen peroxide 3aiodoacetic acid 3amicrofiltration 3amunicipal wastewater 3aoxidation 3aozone 3areverse osmosis 3atoxicity 3awater reuse 0aNitrosamines 0aDisinfection byproducts 0aPotable reuse 0aOzone and biological activated carbon 0aUV free chlorine AOP1 aSzczuka, Aleksandra1 aShabƒÅnƒ´, FarzƒÅnah,1 aMunoz, Joline1 aAflaki, Roshanak1 aHammond, Slavica D.1 aMitch, William A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4917-09380 tWater research.g2019 Apr. 01, v. 152 p.215-225dElsevier LtdwJournal:1966x0043-13547nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2018.12.0623Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01378naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001600140245010900156300001800265520034300283592002800626650001900654650001200673650002000685650002600705650001800731650001500749700001800764700001600782700001700798700001800815773012400833856007400957852000901031655001201040IND60663133220221118033829.0190909e20150512xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066313322DNAL7 a10.1039/c5gc00092k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSun, Xiaofu10aExtraction of 5-HMF from the conversion of glucose in ionic liquid [Bmim]Cl by compressed carbon dioxide  ap. 2719-2722.  aThe efficient extraction of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) from the conversion products of glucose in an ionic liquid has been achieved via charging compressed CO‚ÇÇ into the mixtures.

All animals were then subdivided into 3 groups: before-exercise (BE); during-exercise (DE); after-exercise (AE). The DE group was exercised on treadmill for 1 hour just before being sacrificed. Animals in the AE group were allowed to take a rest for 2 hours after being exercised like the DE group. Glucose and free fatty acids were compared in plasma. Glycogen and triglyceride were compared in liver and skeletal muscle. Protein levels were compared in plasma, liver, and skeletal muscle. Compared with the B<sub>6</sub>+ group, plasma glucose levels of the B<sub>6</sub>‚Äì group were significantly lower before and after exercise. Muscle glycogen levels of the B<sub>6</sub>‚Äì group were significantly lower than those of the B<sub>6</sub>+ group regardless of exercise. The liver glycogen level of the B<sub>6</sub>‚Äì group was also significantly lower than that of B<sub>6</sub>+ group during and after exercise. Before exercise, plasma free fatty acid levels were not significantly different between the B<sub>6</sub>+ and B<sub>6</sub>‚Äì groups, and plasma free fatty acid levels of the B<sub>6</sub>‚Äì group were significantly lower during and after exercise. The muscle triglyceride level of the B<sub>6</sub>‚Äì group was significantly lower than that of the B<sub>6</sub>+ group before exercise, and there were no differences between B<sub>6</sub>+ and B<sub>6</sub>‚Äì groups during and after exercise. Liver triglyceride levels were not significantly different between B<sub>6</sub>+ and B<sub>6</sub>‚Äì groups. Plasma protein levels of the B<sub>6</sub>‚Äì group were lower than those of B<sub>6</sub>+ before and after exercise. Muscle protein levels of the B<sub>6</sub>‚Äì group were not significantly different from those of the B<sub>6</sub>+ group. Liver protein levels of the B<sub>6</sub>‚Äì group were significantly lower than that of the B<sub>6</sub>+ group after exercise. Liver protein levels of both B<sub>6</sub>+ and B<sub>6</sub>‚Äì groups were not significantly changed, regardless of exercise. Thus, it is suggested that vitamin B<sub>6</sub> deficiency may reduce fuel storage and utilization with exercise in physically trained rats.  aPublisher supplied data 3ablood glucose 3ablood proteins 3adiet 3aexercise 3afree fatty acids 3afuels 3aglucose 3aglycogen 3aliver 3aliver protein 3amuscle protein 3amuscles 3aprotein content 3arats 3askeletal muscle 3atriacylglycerols 0aVitamin B<sub>6</sub> 0amoderate physical training 0aprotein 0atriglyceride 0astored fuel1 aCho,  Y.-O.0 tInternational journal for vitamin and nutrition research.g2008 Mar. 1, v. 78, no. 2 p.64-69dVerlag Hans Huberx0300-98317nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1024%2F0300-9831.78.2.643Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04088naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100001700137245008800154300001800242520287900260592002803139650001403167650001203181650001303193650002303206650001303229650001203242650002203254650001703276650001203293650001503305650001103320650001503331650002103346650002003367650002003387650002603407650002603433700001703459773009803476856007103574852000903645655001203654IND60518969420221121014017.0160419e199607  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051896942DNAL7 a10.2307/22655492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCronin, Greg10aSusceptibility to Herbivores Depends on Recent History of both the Plant and Animal  ap. 1531-1543.  aPhysical stress to seaweeds and hunger stress of herbivores can influence the outcome of chemically mediated seaweed‚Äîherbivore interactions. The unpalatable brown seaweed Dictyota ciliolata produces the diterpenoid secondary metabolites pachydictyol A, dictyol B acetate, and dictyodial. At natural concentrations, pachydictyol A deterred the sea urchin Arbacia punctulata but did not inhibit feeding by the pinfish Lagodon rhomboides or the amphipod Ampithoe longimana until concentrations were 2.5‚Äî5 times natural levels. Dictyol B acetate deterred the urchin, amphipod, and pinfish at, or far below, natural concentrations. Dictyodial was too unstable to assay directly, but indirect experiments suggested that natural concentrations deterred the urchin, but not the pinfish or amphipod. Mild desiccation of D. ciliolata reduced concentrations of the different secondary metabolites by 7‚Äî38% and plants became 2.6‚Äî3.4 times more susceptible to urchin and amphipod grazing. The combined concentrations of pachydictyol A and dictyol B acetate found in undesiccated Dictyota ciliolata deterred feeding by urchins, but this deterrent effect was lost at concentrations found in the desiccated plants. Desiccated and undesiccated plants did not differ in nutritive value (as measured by protein and total N content) or toughness. Thus, desiccated plants became more palatable because chemical defenses were lost, not because nutritive value was increased. The stress of near‚Äîsurface ultraviolet radiation also caused significant physiological changes in Dictyota ciliolata. UV‚Äîexposed blades bleached, senesced, and grew 84% less than blades protected from UV radiation. Tissue loss and minimal growth of UV‚Äîstressed plants constrained our sample sizes, but the limited assays that could be run suggested that UV stress may lower chemical defenses and increase plant susceptibility to herbivores. Because many previous investigations of herbivore feeding patterns used animals that had been starved for days before an assay, we tested the effects of this commonly used procedure on feeding discrimination. Recently fed urchins always avoided food containing natural concentrations of pachydictyol A during separate feeding trials performed on each of four consecutive days. In contrast, urchins deprived of food for 3 d before this assay did not avoid the treated food on days 1 and 2 of feeding trials, but did avoid it on days 3 and 4 after their hunger was reduced by feeding during days 1 and 2. If we had used only starved urchins (a common procedure in previous investigations), we could have concluded, with apparent justification, that urchins were unaffected by pachydictyol A (if the assays were run for only 1‚Äî2 d) or that they needed 2 d of exposure to the compound in order to learn to avoid it. Both of these conclusions would have been incorrect.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAmphipoda 3aArbacia 3aDictyota 3aLagodon rhomboides 3aacetates 3aanimals 3achemical defenses 3aditerpenoids 3agrazing 3aherbivores 3ahunger 3amacroalgae 3anitrogen content 3anutritive value 3aprotein content 3asecondary metabolites 3aultraviolet radiation1 aHay, Mark E.0 tEcology.g1996 July, v. 77, no. 5 p.1531-1543dEcological Society of Americax0012-96587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2307/22655493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03302naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100006200147245012200209300001100331520173200342592002802074596004402102650002002146650003302166650001402199650001402213650001702227650002302244650001102267650001102278650001402289650001502303650001502318650001902333650002802352650002502380700002102405700002802426700002902454700002802483700002602511700002702537700002402564773014102588856008202729852000902811655001202820IND60645279520221123042737.0190621e201906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064527952DNAL7 a10.1007/s11274-019-2665-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKaretkin, Boris A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0976-970012aA quantitative model of Bacillus cereus ATCC 9634 growth inhibition by bifidobacteria for synbiotic effect evaluation  ap. 89.  aThe present study is dedicated to the development of novel criteria for assessing the synbiotic effect of prebiotic and probiotic composition against a specific pathogen. These criteria were obtained from the quantitative model of Bifidobacterium adolescentis ATCC 15703 and Bacillus cereus ATCC 9634 (as a model food contaminant) competition in co-culture fermentation. The model is based on the hypothesis that probiotics can reduce the specific growth rate of non-probiotics by producing short-chain fatty acids. To define the relationship between the specific growth rate of non-probiotics and short-chain fatty acid yields, the inhibition constants were determined separately for each inhibitor produced by bifidobacteria (lactic, acetic and propionic acids) in a pure culture of bacilli. Two different equations based on the minimum inhibitor concentration (MIC) and inhibition constant (K·µ¢) were used to connect the specific growth rate and concentrations of inhibitors. The yields of the inhibitors mentioned above were obtained from co-culture experiments. The experimental values and the values predicted by the model of Bacillus count did not differ significantly (R¬≤ not less than 0.83) in the competition experiments. Therefore, the general criterion of the synbiotic effect was derived from the model and presents the coefficient of non-probiotic specific growth rate reduction as a result of probiotic growth and inhibitor formation in the final co-culture fermentation. This criterion has been examined for different commercial prebiotics coupled with the Bifidobacterium adolescentis strain. The synergistic combination of inulin GR with bifidobacteria had the best effect against Bacillus cereus ATCC 9634.  aPublisher supplied data  a17-79-20365cRussian Science Foundation 3aBacillus cereus 3aBifidobacterium adolescentis 3acoculture 3aequations 3afermentation 3afood contamination 3ainulin 3amodels 3apathogens 3aprebiotics 3aprobiotics 3apropionic acid 3ashort chain fatty acids 3aspecific growth rate1 aGuseva, Elena V.1 aEvdokimova, Svetlana A.1 aMishchenko, Anastasia S.1 aKhabibulina, Natalia V.1 aGrosheva, Veronika D.1 aMenshutina, Natalia V.1 aPanfilov, Victor I.0 tWorld journal of microbiology & biotechnology.g2019 June, v. 35, no. 6 p.89-89dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl44995x0959-39937nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11274-019-2665-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02494naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100006500151245010600216300001600322520111200338592002801450650002301478650001501501650001401516650002701530650002201557650000901579650001101588650000701599650001201606650001501618653002901633653003301662653002001695653002301715700001901738700002401757700002101781700002501802700002301827773010301850856008601953852000902039655001202048IND60537949920221117191944.0190408e201512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053794992DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecoleng.2015.10.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSeesuriyachan, Phisit1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0898-557510aImprovement in efficiency of lignin degradation by Fenton reaction using synergistic catalytic action  ap. 283-287.  aLignin is a complex aromatic compound and a by-product from the wood pulping process. We used a central composite design to assess the efficiency of synergistic catalysts (Fe0, Fe2+ and Fe3+) and H2O2 in the Fenton process for removal of lignin, aromatic compounds, and chemical oxygen demand (COD) from lignin solution. Results showed that the Fe0 and H2O2 concentration were the most significant variables in lignin degradation by Fenton reaction, while Fe2+ and Fe3+ concentration were the next most important variables. The highest removal efficiencies were obtained with concentration levels of 7.61mg/L Fe0, 9.89mg/L Fe2+, 14.27mg/L Fe3+, and 376.88mg/L H2O2 at pH 3.0 and 35¬∞C. Under these optimal conditions, the efficiencies of removal of lignin, aromatic compounds, and COD were 98.45%, 82.63%, and 100%, respectively, while the removal rates of lignin and aromatic compounds were 23.73mg/L/h and 27.75mg/L/h, respectively. The optimization results revealed that using synergistic catalysts in the Fenton reaction was more effective in treating wastewater and resulted in decreased cost and time.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaromatic compounds 3abyproducts 3acatalysts 3achemical oxygen demand 3ahydrogen peroxide 3airon 3alignin 3apH 3apulping 3awastewater 0aCentral composite design 0aSynergistic catalytic action 0aFenton reaction 0aLignin degradation1 aKuntiya, Ampin1 aKawee-ai, Arthitaya1 aTechapun, Charin1 aChaiyaso, Thanongsak1 aLeksawasdi, Noppol0 tEcological engineering.g2015 Dec., v. 85 p.283-287dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11630x0925-85747nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoleng.2015.10.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03221naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100006700142245011800209500002000327520171600347592002802063596002902091596002202120596002302142650001902165650001602184650001502200650001102215650001302226650001902239650001502258650001302273650001602286650000902302700005802311700002102369700005802390700006202448700005502510773013602565856007702701852000902778655001202787IND60789805320221121035012.0220822e202102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078980532DNAL7 a10.1029/2020JC0167492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJohnston, T.‚ÄâM.

Since NIWs are mostly horizontal, their vertical propagation out of the mixed layer is slow. However, mesoscale vorticity and shear increase vertical group speed by increasing near‚Äêinertial frequency and horizontal wavenumber. To assess NIW propagation, a profiling float array under Super Typhoon Mangkhut in September 2018 made broad and persistent measurements in space and time of density in the upper 200¬†m and depth‚Äêmean velocity. The TC wake was a region of positive vorticity on its southern side, displayed elevated shear, and thereby enhanced downward propagation of NIWs. The vertical energy flux is estimated as 0.04‚Äì0.11¬†W m‚Åª¬≤, which is about 1%‚Äì4% (3%‚Äì8%) of the mean total (near‚Äêinertial) wind work of 3.0 (1.3) W m‚Åª¬≤ calculated from a high‚Äêresolution TC model. Considerable uncertainties arise in the (a) estimated group speed based on wavelength, shear, and frequency and (b) energy density based on depth‚Äêvarying density and the NIW polarization relations, which are sensitive to frequency. Following the TC's passage, NIWs propagated southward and horizontal wavelengths decreased from 1,000 to 500¬†km, as time progressed. Also, we identify an interfacial wave at the mixed layer base, which displaces isopycnals vertically. The following process is suggested. As the North Equatorial Current flows over these displacements, which act as topographic obstacles, secondary NIWs propagate up‚Äê/downward into the mixed layer/thermocline. These waves are 180¬∞ out of phase in the mixed layer and thermocline, which can enhance shear at the mixed layer base.  aPublisher supplied data  aNA17OAR4310259cNOAA CVP  aN00014163085cONR  aN000141613073cONR 3aenergy density 3aenergy flow 3ageophysics 3amodels 3aresearch 3aspace and time 3atopography 3atyphoons 3awavelengths 3awind1 aWang, Shuguang1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1861-92851 aLee, Chia‚ÄêYing1 aMoum, James N.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0152-62291 aRudnick, Daniel L.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2624-70741 aSobel, Adam1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3602-05670 tJournal of geophysical research.g2021 Feb., v. 126, no. 2 p.e2020JC016749-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:27942x2169-92757nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2020JC0167493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02444naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001600148245011700164300001300281520111000294592002801404650001601432650001401448650001301462650003001475650001501505650001401520650001801534650001101552650001801563650001101581650003701592653002401629653003001653653002801683653001801711700001601729700002201745700002301767700001801790773009901808856008201907852000901989655001201998IND60599130320221117234846.0180702e201407  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059913032DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcat.2014.04.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHou, Ruijun10aSelective hydrogenation of 1,3-butadiene on PdNi bimetallic catalyst: From model surfaces to supported catalysts  ap. 1-10.  aThe selective hydrogenation of 1,3-butadiene serves as a means to purify the butene stream generated from cracking naphtha or gas oil. To identify selective hydrogenation catalysts, 1,3-butadiene was studied on single crystal Ni/Pd(111) bimetallic surfaces, utilizing density functional theory (DFT) calculations and temperature-programmed desorption (TPD). DFT calculations predicted that the Pd-terminated bimetallic surface should be more active and selective to produce 1-butene, which were verified experimentally using TPD. The promising results on model surfaces were extended to Œ≥-Al2O3-supported catalysts using both batch and flow reactors. Extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) confirmed the formation of bimetallic nanoparticles. The PdNi bimetallic catalyst showed higher hydrogenation activity and 1-butene selectivity than the monometallic catalysts. The excellent correlation between model surfaces and supported catalysts demonstrates the feasibility of designing effective bimetallic catalysts for selective hydrogenation reactions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-radiation 3acatalysts 3acracking 3adensity functional theory 3adesorption 3afuel oils 3ahydrogenation 3amodels 3ananoparticles 3anickel 3atransmission electron microscopy 0aNi/Pd(111) surfaces 0aPdNi bimetallic catalysts 0aSelective hydrogenation 0a1,3-Butadiene1 aYu, Weiting1 aPorosoff, Marc D.1 aChen, Jingguang G.1 aWang, Tiefeng0 tJournal of catalysis.g2014 July, v. 316 p.1-10dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11700x0021-95177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcat.2014.04.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03195naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100001800188245010600206300001100312506007600323520144200399592002801841596014701869506003702016650002602053650003502079650001602114650002002130650001402150650002002164650001702184650001102201650001102212650001502223650001302238650001902251650001402270650001002284650001202294650002802306700005602334700001502390700002202405700001802427773014102445856008202586852000902668655001202677IND60645279620221207094950.0190621e201906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064527962DNAL7 a10.1007/s11274-019-2653-62doi7 aPMC65366362pmcid7 a311344002pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGodlewska, K.10aPotential applications of cyanobacteria: Spirulina platensis filtrates and homogenates in agriculture  ap. 80.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aIn the present paper, products obtained from a blue-green microalga Spirulina platensis filtrate (applied for seed soaking and for foliar spray) and homogenate (used for seed coating) were tested in the cultivation of radish. Their effect on length, wet mass, multielemental composition and the greenness index of the radish leaves was examined. Multi-elemental analyses of the algal products, and radish were also performed using inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES). The best soaking time, concentrations of filtrate and doses of homogenate were established. The longest and heaviest plants were observed for homogenate applied at a dose of 300¬†¬µL per 1.5¬†g of seeds and 15% of filtrate applied as foliar spray. The highest chlorophyll content was found in the group treated with 100¬†¬µL of homogenate and 5% of filtrate. In the case of soaking time, the longest plants were in the group where seeds were soaked for 6¬†h, but the heaviest and greenest were after soaking for 48¬†h. The applied algal products increased the content of elements in seedlings. Obtained results proved that algal extracts have high potential to be applied in modern horticulture and agriculture. The use of Spirulina-based products is consistent with the idea of sustainable agriculture that could help to ensure production of sufficient human food to meet the needs of rising population and protection of the environment.  aPublisher supplied data  aNo 0401/0157/18cPolish Ministry of Science and Higher Education for the Faculty of Chemistry of Wroc≈Çaw University of Science and Technology0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aArthrospira platensis 3aatomic absorption spectrometry 3achlorophyll 3acrop production 3afiltrates 3afoliar spraying 3ahorticulture 3ahumans 3aleaves 3amicroalgae 3aradishes 3aseed dressings 3aseedlings 3aseeds 3asoaking 3asustainable agriculture1 aMichalak, I.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8084-96421 aPacyga, P.1 aBa≈õlady≈Ñska, S.1 aChojnacka, K.0 tWorld journal of microbiology & biotechnology.g2019 June, v. 35, no. 6 p.80-80dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl44995x0959-39937nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11274-019-2653-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03162naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005700150245006500207300001600272520169500288592002801983650001302011650001702024650001502041650001302056650001702069650002902086650001802115650001002133650002202143650001302165650001302178650001902191650000702210650001502217650002602232653002102258653001302279653003102292653001802323700001702341700001702358700001202375700001402387700006402401773009702465856008502562852000902647655001202656IND60629026420221119020346.0191024e20190401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062902642DNAL7 a10.1016/j.watres.2018.12.0652doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Xinran1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5589-887210aSynergistic removal of ammonium by monochloramine photolysis  ap. 226-233.  aThe presence of ammonium (NH4+) in drinking water treatment results in inhibition of disinfection efficiency and formation of nitrogenous disinfection by-products. Our previous study found monochloramine (NH2Cl) photolysis under 254‚ÄØnm UV irradiation can be effective for removal of NH4+; however, the mechanisms of NH4+ degradation in this process were unknown. The kinetics and fundamental radical chemistry responsible for NH4+ removal in the UV/NH2Cl process were investigated in this study. The results showed that the pseudo first-order rate constant for NH4+ degradation in the UV/NH2Cl process ranged between 3.6‚ÄØ√ó‚ÄØ10‚àí4 to 1.8‚ÄØ√ó‚ÄØ10‚àí3 s‚àí1. Solution pH affected radical conversion and a higher NH4+ degradation efficiency was achieved under acidic conditions. The effects of chloride were limited; however, the presence of either bicarbonate or natural organic matter scavenged radicals and inhibited NH4+ removal. NH2Cl photolysis generated an aminyl radical (NH2‚Ä¢) and a chlorine radical (Cl‚Ä¢) that further transformed to a chlorine dimer (Cl2‚Ä¢-) and a hydroxyl radical (HO‚Ä¢). The second-order rate constants for Cl‚Ä¢ and Cl2‚Ä¢- reacting with NH4+ were estimated as 2.59‚ÄØ√ó‚ÄØ108‚ÄØM‚àí1s‚àí1 and 3.45‚ÄØ√ó‚ÄØ105‚ÄØM‚àí1s‚àí1‚ÄØat pH 3.9, respectively. Cl‚Ä¢, Cl2‚Ä¢-, and HO‚Ä¢ contributed 95.2%, 3.5%, and 1.3% to NH4+ removal, respectively, at the condition of 3‚ÄØmM NH2Cl and pH 7.5. Major products included nitrite and nitrate, possibly accompanied by nitrogen-containing gases. This investigation provides insight into the photochemistry of NH4+ degradation in the UV/NH2Cl process and offers an alternative method for drinking water production.  aPublisher supplied data 3aammonium 3abicarbonates 3abyproducts 3achlorine 3adisinfection 3adrinking water treatment 3afree radicals 3agases 3ahydroxyl radicals 3anitrates 3anitrites 3aorganic matter 3apH 3aphotolysis 3aultraviolet radiation 0aUV/NH2Cl process 0aAmmonium 0aReactive chlorine radicals 0aKinetic model1 aRen, Pengfei1 aLi, Weiguang1 aLei, Yu1 aYang, Xin1 aBlatchley, Ernest R.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4561-86350 tWater research.g2019 Apr. 01, v. 152 p.226-233dElsevier LtdwJournal:1966x0043-13547nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2018.12.0653Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02667naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100003600140245019500176520145100371592002801822650001001850650002401860650003401884650001301918650001201931650002601943650001501969650001601984700002102000700003502021700003002056700002602086773012202112856007402234852000902308655001202317IND60745555120221119230333.0210723e20210629xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074555512DNAL7 a10.3390/nu130722242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHern√°ndez-Socorro, Carmen Rosa10aNovel High-Quality Sonographic Methods to Diagnose Muscle Wasting in Long-Stay Critically Ill Patients: Shear Wave Elastography, Superb Microvascular Imaging and Contrast-Enhanced Ultrasound  aNovel ultrasound (US) methods are required to assess qualitative changes in the quadriceps rectus femoris (QRF) muscle when evaluating mechanically ventilated, long-stay ICU patients with suspected neuromuscular acquired weakness (ICUAW). Our aim was to analyze novel US muscle assessment methods in these patients versus healthy controls by carrying out a prospective observational study. Shear wave elastography (SWE) showed, with a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve of 0.972 (95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.916‚Äì1.000), that patients increased muscle stiffness associated with muscle fibrosis when diagnosed with ICUAW. We also performed, for the first time, superb microvascular imaging (SMI), which is an innovative US technique designed for imaging microvascularization unseen with color Doppler US, and observed that 53.8% of cases had significantly lower QRF muscle microvascular angiogenic activity than controls (p < 0.001). Finally, we used contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) to analyze maximum and minimum QRF muscle perfusion and obtained a ROC curve of 0.8, but when used as markers for SMI, their diagnostic capacity increased to 0.988 (CI = 0.965‚Äì1) and 0.932 (CI = 0.858‚Äì1), respectively. These findings show, for the first time, that these novel sonographic muscle methods should be used for their diagnostic capacity when assessing sarcopenic processes associated with this group of critically ill patients.  aPublisher supplied data 3acolor 3aconfidence interval 3aelasticity imaging techniques 3afibrosis 3amuscles 3aobservational studies 3asarcopenia 3aultrasonics1 aSaavedra, Pedro 1 aL√≥pez-Fern√°ndez, Juan Carlos1 aL√ºbbe-Vazquez, Federico 1 aRuiz-Santana, Sergio 0 tNutrients.g2021 June 29, v. 13, no. 7dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2271x2072-66437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu130722243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03127naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245009200172300001800264520158500282592002801867650002501895650001501920650001501935650001001950650002501960650002901985650001502014650001202029650001102041650001702052650001502069650000902084650000902093650001402102650001202116650002902128650001602157650001602173653003002189653001202219653001602231653001602247653001802263653002302281700002502304700002602329700001902355700001802374773008702392856008502479852000902564655001202573IND60554087520221120041820.0161024e201407  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055408752DNAL7 a10.1016/j.procbio.2014.03.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 a≈†li≈æytƒó, Rasa10aNutritionally rich marine proteins from fresh herring by-products for human consumption  ap. 1205-1215.  aMarine oils and proteins are valuable compounds, but under unfavorable conditions these components are easily oxidized and enzymatically degraded. We have designed an industrial process for producing high quality human grade proteins from fresh herring by-products. Two different processes were tested in semi-industrial scale: (i) thermal extraction to separate oil and proteins and (ii) enzymatic hydrolysis with different commercial proteases to produce fish protein hydrolysates (FPH) and separate oil. Both stick water from thermal extraction and fish protein hydrolysates, after hydrolysis, are nutritionally rich fractions and yielded approx. 18 and 25% of dry material in these fractions respectively. Neither season nor enzymes used influenced the color of hydrolysate powders, but time and temperature of the processes are important tools for controlling the color. Fishing seasons did not influence bitterness of hydrolysates and stick water samples, but both the process conditions and applied enzymes played an important role for the formation of bitterness. Insoluble fractions after both processes had significantly higher protein efficiency ratio: 3.08 and 2.93 compared to soluble fractions: 2.62 and 2.76 after hydrolysis and thermal extraction respectively. Both stick water and FPH showed antioxidative activity against both iron (15ŒºM of Fe3+) and hemoglobin (80ppm) induced oxidation. Herring proteins (1.25mg/ml) were able to reduce iron induced oxidation by 50‚Äì70%, while Hb induced oxidation was reduced by 70‚Äì80% using 4mg/ml proteins concentration.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantioxidant activity 3abitterness 3abyproducts 3acolor 3aenzymatic hydrolysis 3afish protein hydrolysate 3ahemoglobin 3aherring 3ahumans 3ahydrolysates 3ahydrolysis 3airon 3aoils 3aoxidation 3apowders 3aprotein efficiency ratio 3aproteinases 3atemperature 0aFish protein hydrolysates 0aHerring 0aBy-products 0aNutritional 0aAntioxidative 0aSensory properties1 aCarvajal, Ana Karina1 aMozuraityte, Revilija1 aAursand, Marit1 aStorr√∏, Ivar0 tProcess Biochemistry.g2014 July, v. 49 p.1205-1215dElsevier Ltdx1359-51137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.procbio.2014.03.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02603naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002400151245007900175300001600254520132300270592002801593650001201621650001701633650001201650650001901662650001901681650001601700650002201716650001001738650002901748650001201777650001901789653002201808653001801830653002001848653001901868653001901887700003601906700001901942773011301961856008602074852000902160655001202169IND60591210620221119100722.0210603e20180420xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059121062DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2018.01.2212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLima, Luiz Paulo de14aThe energy mix and energy efficiency analysis for Brazilian dairy industry  ap. 209-216.  aThis paper focuses on an analysis of the energy mix profile and energy efficiency of the Brazilian dairy industry. It investigates dairies‚Äô energy mix and energy efficiency and identifies some actions for a cleaner energy mix. Primary data from 37 dairy cheese-making establishments distributed among the Brazilian regions were obtained from online surveys. The results indicate that woodfuel plays a critical role, being the most used fuel in thermal energy generation, while diesel is dominant in electric generation. It also emphasizes that only 51% of the dairy establishments utilize electric energy generators. Other alternative biomass sources are still incipient in the sector, restricted to just 9.5% of the cases for thermal energy generation and no cases for electricity. Regarding the energy efficiency analysis, the results suggest dairies are more scale efficient than pure technical efficient. However, the dairies present a low energy efficiency level. There is no evidence that inefficiencies are differently distributed according to their size. These findings are important for government agencies, industry associations, scientists, universities and research institutes. High inefficiencies, regarding the use of electricity and thermal energy, are a key issue in sustainable bioenergy production.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiomass 3acheesemaking 3adairies 3adairy industry 3aelectric power 3aelectricity 3aenergy efficiency 3afuels 3arenewable energy sources 3asurveys 3athermal energy 0aEnergy efficiency 0aFood industry 0aMilk processing 0aRenewable fuel 0aSustainability1 aRibeiro, Gabriel Browne de Deus1 aPerez, Ronaldo0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2018 Apr. 20, v. 181 p.209-216dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2018.01.2213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02672naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002400152245010300176300001600279520104900295592002801344650002101372650002201393650002901415650002201444650002301466650002001489650001201509650000901521650001901530650002401549650001601573650001901589650001801608650001601626650003301642650001901675650001401694650003701708653001701745653001701762653001801779653001301797653001901810700001801829700001701847700001701864700002001881773013401901856008602035852000902121655001202130IND60552792320221123013226.0170607e20140405xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055279232DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfa.2014.01.0582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJoshi, Mahesh Kumar10aOne-pot synthesis of Ag-iron oxide/reduced graphene oxide nanocomposite via hydrothermal treatment  ap. 102-108.  aA multifunctional silver-iron oxide/reduced graphene oxide (Ag-Fe3O4/RGO) nanocomposite was prepared by facile, green and one-pot synthesis using hydrothermal treatment of aqueous solution containing graphene oxide (GO), iron(II) chloride tetrahydrate, silver nitrate, and ethanol. This aqueous solution was heated at 130¬∞C for 3h where simultaneous reduction of GO and crystallization of metal and metal oxide NPs was simply carried out. Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), infra-red, Raman, and X-ray diffraction indicated the formation of Ag-Fe3O4/RGO nanocomposite. The catalytic activity and antibacterial capacity of nanocomposite were studied by reduction of 4-nitrophenol and destruction of Escherichia coli, respectively. Results indicated that as-synthesized nanocomposite has high catalytic and antibacterial capacity with good reusability.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of iron or iron/zinc supplementation on iron apparent absorption (IAA) in rats fed a diet reduced in all vitamins and minerals (R). The study was conducted on 77, 6-week-old male Wistar rats in 3 stages as follows: stage I, 4-week period of adaptation to R diet (50% less vitamins and minerals compared to AIN-93M recommendations); stage II, 4-week supplementation period with iron (RSFe) or iron/zinc (RSFeZn); stage III, 2-week post-supplementation period (rats fed R diet). Feces samples to IAA determination were collected at the 20‚Äì22nd days of stage I and II and the 10‚Äì12th days of stage III. To determine the changes in IAA after introducing and discontinuation of supplementation, feces were collected for 3¬†days after introducing (stage II) and 5¬†days after the supplementation discontinuation (stage III). At the end of stage II, compared to R rats, the IAA was statistically significantly higher in RSFe and RSFeZn rats (30.3‚Äâ¬±‚Äâ2.0% vs. 47.4‚Äâ¬±‚Äâ1.2% and 51.0‚Äâ¬±‚Äâ1.7%, respectively). After introducing iron or iron/zinc supplementation, the IAA stabilized fast already in the first day, while after discontinuation of the supplementation, at least 4¬†days was required to the stabilization. At the end of stage III, the IAA was significantly lower in RSFe (15.8‚Äâ¬±‚Äâ6.6%) than in RSFeZn rats (43.4‚Äâ¬±‚Äâ5.9%). In conclusion, to confirm that iron and zinc supplementation is more beneficial than iron supplementation only, especially after discontinuation of supplementation, further research among humans is necessary.  aPublisher supplied data  aN N312 329735cMinisterstwo Nauki i Szkolnictwa Wy≈ºszego 3aabsorption 3adietary mineral supplements 3afeces 3ahuman nutrition 3airon 3airon absorption 3amales 3aresearch 3azinc1 aJanuszko, Olga1 aFrƒÖckiewicz, Joanna1 aMadej, Dawid1 aKaluza, Joanna0 tBiological trace element research.g2021 Aug., v. 199, no. 8 p.3013-3020dSpringer USwJournal:jnl11497x0163-49847nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12011-020-02433-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03739naa a2200649 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094024002200132024001900154040001800173100002500191245015700216300001600373506007600389520170700465592002802172506003702200650000802237650002202245650001102267650001102278650001002289650002002299650004202319650001702361650003202378650001002410650001702420650000902437650001802446650002702464650001702491650001302508650001402521650003002535650002502565650001002590650002002600650002002620650001302640651001902653653001302672653001902685653002502704653003102729700002102760700002002781700002302801700002002824700002402844773011502868856008502983852000903068655001203077IND60543863420221207101525.0190412e201506  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054386342DNAL7 a10.1016/j.meegid.2015.03.0142doi7 aPMC44249482pmcid7 a257963592pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCwiklinski, Krystyna10aCharacterisation of a novel panel of polymorphic microsatellite loci for the liver fluke, Fasciola hepatica, using a next generation sequencing approach  ap. 298-304.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe liver fluke, Fasciola hepatica is an economically important pathogen of sheep and cattle and has been described by the WHO as a re-emerging zoonosis. Control is heavily reliant on the use of drugs, particularly triclabendazole and as a result resistance has now emerged. The population structure of F. hepatica is not well known, yet it can impact on host‚Äìparasite interactions and parasite control with drugs, particularly regarding the spread of triclabendazole resistance. We have identified 2448 potential microsatellites from 83Mb of F. hepatica genome sequence using msatfinder. Thirty-five loci were developed and optimised for microsatellite PCR, resulting in a panel of 15 polymorphic loci, with a range of three to 15 alleles. This panel was validated on genomic DNA from 46 adult F. hepatica; 38 liver flukes sourced from a Northwest abattoir, UK and 8 liver flukes from an established isolate (Shrewsbury; Ridgeway Research). Evidence for null alleles was found at four loci (Fh_1, Fh_8, Fh_13 and Fh_14), which showed markedly higher levels of homozygosity than the remaining 11 loci. Of the 38 liver flukes isolated from cattle livers (n=10) at the abattoir, 37 genotypes were identified. Using a multiplex approach all 15 loci could be amplified from several life cycle stages that typically yield low amounts of DNA, including metacercariae, the infective life cycle stage present on pasture, highlighting the utility of this multiplex microsatellite panel. This study reports the largest panel of microsatellite markers available to date for population studies of F. hepatica and the first multiplex panel of microsatellite markers that can be used for several life cycle stages.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDNA 3aFasciola hepatica 3aadults 3acattle 3adrugs 3agenetic markers 3ahigh-throughput nucleotide sequencing 3ahomozygosity 3ahost-parasite relationships 3aliver 3aliver flukes 3aloci 3ametacercariae 3amicrosatellite repeats 3anull alleles 3apastures 3apathogens 3apolymerase chain reaction 3apopulation structure 3asheep 3aslaughterhouses 3atriclabendazole 3azoonoses 3aUnited Kingdom 0aFasciola 0aMicrosatellite 0aPopulation structure 0aNext generation sequencing1 aAllen, Katherine1 aLaCourse, James1 aWilliams, Diana J.1 aPaterson, Steve1 aHodgkinson, Jane E.0 tInfection, genetics, and evolution.g2015 June, v. 32 p.298-304dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12450x1567-13487nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.meegid.2015.03.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01328naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100001700138245009600155300001800251520041000269592002800679650001900707650001300726700001700739700002700756700002300783700002300806773012800829856007200957852000901029655001201038IND60657425320190919000000.0190816e20031003xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065742532DNAL7 a10.1039/b306171j2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCoppo, Paolo10aSynthesis, solid state structure and polymerisation of a fully planar cyclopentadithiophene  ap. 2548-2549.  aThe new fully planar cyclopentadithiophene, 4-n-dodecylidene-4H-cyclopenta(2,1-b;3,4-b‚Ä≤)dithiophene, shows extensive œÄ-stacking in the solid state with short intermolecular distances (ca. 3.5 √Ö) between adjacent molecules.

Animals must track the changing environment, remember the best options and make choices accordingly. While several experimental studies have explored the idea that sampling behavior reflects the amount of environmental change, we take the next logical step in asking how change influences memory. We explore the hypothesis that memory length should be tied to the ecological relevance and the value of the information learned, and that environmental change is a key determinant of the value of memory. We use a dynamic programming model to confirm our predictions and then test memory length in a factorial experiment. In our experimental situation we manipulate rates of change in a simple foraging task for blue jays over a 36h period. After jays experienced an experimentally determined change regime, we tested them at a range of retention intervals, from 1 to 72h. Manipulated rates of change influenced learning and sampling rates: subjects sampled more and learned more quickly in the high change condition. Tests of retention revealed significant interactions between retention interval and the experienced rate of change. We observed a striking and surprising difference between the high and low change treatments at the 24h retention interval. In agreement with earlier work we find that a circadian retention interval is special, but we find that the extent of this ‚Äòspecialness‚Äô depends on the subject's prior experience of environmental change. Specifically, experienced rates of change seem to influence how subjects balance recent information against past experience in a way that interacts with the passage of time.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aanimals 3adecision making 3adynamic programming 3aforaging 3amemory 3amodels 3aprediction1 aStephens, David W.0 tBehavioural processes.g2012 Feb., v. 89, no. 2 p.86-94dElsevier B.V.x0376-63577nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.beproc.2011.10.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01173naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100001700138245010700155300001800262520023700280592002800517650001800545650001200563650002500575650003500600650002300635700001500658773012900673856007200802852000900874655001200883IND60657425420221117234401.0190816e20030902xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065742542DNAL7 a10.1039/b306189b2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Junwei10aSynthesis of single-crystalline nanobelts of ternary bismuth oxide bromide with different compositions  ap. 2320-2321.  aTernary bismuth oxide bromide nanobelts have been prepared by using the cationic surfactant cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) as the bromine source; their composition can be easily controlled by changing the reaction conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3abismuth oxide 3abromine 3acationic surfactants 3acetyltrimethylammonium bromide 3achemical reactions1 aLi, Yadong0 tChemical communications.g2003 Sept. 2, , no. 18 p.2320-2321dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26910x1364-548X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/b306189b3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03248naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001200152245010300164520204100267592002802308650001902336650001602355650001602371650001902387650002102406650001502427650002402442650001402466650002102480650001402501653003102515653001702546653004602563653001502609700001302624700002002637773009702657856008702754852000902841655001202850IND60769450920221119195550.0220706e20220501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076945092DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apenergy.2022.1188442doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPan, Yu12aA half-wave electromagnetic energy-harvesting tie towards safe and intelligent rail transportation  aThis paper presents the design, modeling, and experimental testing of a novel railroad energy harvesting tie for improving rail safety and connectivity and bringing intelligence to the railroad. The system is intended for applications that require trackside power in remote locations and tunnels, where electrical power for wayside safety equipment, wireless communication systems, and health monitoring systems is needed but difficult to supply. Designed to have nearly the same dimensions as a conventional railroad tie, the proposed energy harvesting tie can be installed in the same manner as a standard tie on a track. Two rotary electromagnetic energy harvesters are embedded and shielded inside the energy harvesting tie, and the integrated system is capable of generating electricity from the vertical track movement due to passing wheels, in a robust configuration that is suitable for the railroad environment. The integration of the harvesters into a composite tie that has the same appearance of other ties makes less variable to theft and vandalism. A novel ball-screw type mechanical motion half-wave rectification mechanism is adopted in the proposed design to harvest the kinetic energy of the track during its downward motion and rebound upward without any resistance from the harvesters. A simulation study is performed to better understand the system and predict the performance, based on a nonlinear model. Experiments are subsequently carried out in a load frame on a half-tie prototype with both sinusoidal and field-recorded track displacements to measure the amount of power that can be harvested under ideal conditions and actual field conditions. The test results, which agree well with the simulations, indicate a maximum of 78.1% mechanical efficiency is achieved under harmonic excitations. Field-recorded tie displacements yield 16.1‚Äì44.5¬†W of average power depending on the electrical loads, sufficient for powering sensor suite and trackside electronics that could improve track monitoring and safety.  aPublisher supplied data 3aelectric power 3aelectricity 3aelectronics 3akinetic energy 3anonlinear models 3aprototypes 3arail transportation 3arailroads 3asafety equipment 3avandalism 0aRailroad energy harvesting 0aRailroad tie 0aMechanical motion half-wave rectification 0aBall screw1 aZuo, Lei1 aAhmadian, Mehdi0 tApplied energy.g2022 May 01, v. 313 p.118844-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11876x0306-26197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2022.1188443Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02374naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024004000113040001800153100001600171245010100187300001600288520087100304592002801175650001601203650000901219650001801228650000901246650003101255650001301286650001601299650001601315650001201331650001101343650002101354650001801375650001801393650002001411650004101431653002601472653001301498653002201511653001201533653000901545653002401554700001701578700001701595700001401612700001501626773010701641856008701748852000901835655001201844IND50067288420221117232514.0190402e20131101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006728842DNAL7 a237683492pmid7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2013.02.0862doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAndueza, D.10aUsing visible or near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) on cheese to authenticate cow feeding regimes  ap. 209-214.  aAn experiment was conducted to evaluate the ability of two spectroscopy methods to distinguish between pasture and preserved-forage cheeses.

Negatively charged ceria, zirconia, and alumina particles are reversibly size-stabilized under low ionic strength conditions at and above their isoelectric points using anionic surfactants.Stability is imparted only at surfactant concentrations above the critical micelle concentration and when the particle and the micelle have like-signed charges. Zeta potential measurements demonstrate that little adsorption of anionic surfactant occurs under conditions where the particles are negatively charged. Changes to pH, hydrophobicity, and ionic strength disrupt the surfactant's ability to size-stabilize the slurries. These results suggest that the charged micelles electrosterically hinder the agglomeration of oxide particles.Because the stabilization method does not rely on adsorption, the particle surface remains accessible for chemical reactions, such as those involved in polishing. Metal oxide slurries stabilized by this method remove material at a rate comparable to that of unstabilized slurry. In addition, stabilized slurry is easier to filter, which improves the quality of the polished surface. Stabilizing colloids by this method may prove valuable for systems where particle surface functionality is important, such as those used in ceramics processing, optical polishing, and chemical-mechanical planarization.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3aaluminum oxide 3aanionic surfactants 3aceramics 3achemical reactions 3acolloids 3ahydrophobicity 3aionic strength 3aisoelectric point 3amicelles 3apH 3aslurries 3azeta potential 0aColloid 0aStabilization 0aMicelle 0aPolishing 0aSlurry 0aSurfactant1 aWong, Lana1 aMiller, Philip E.1 aFeit, Michael D.1 aSteele, William1 aSuratwala, Tayyab0 tColloids and Surfaces A: Physicochemical and Engineering Aspects.g2014 Apr. 05, v. 447 p.32-43dElsevier B.V.x0927-77577nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfa.2014.01.0613Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01730naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002500092040001800117100001900135245016500154300001600319520069300335592002801028650002101056650002201077650001101099650001601110650001401126650001201140650001101152650001601163650001201179651002001191700002301211773009901234856003801333852000901371655001201380IND4469201720221118030924.0120328s2012    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446920172DNAL7 a10.1071/BT112992doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOlesen, Trevor10aEffects of defoliation on flower development in atemoya custard apple (Annona cherimola Mill.√óA. squamosa L.) and implications for flower-development modelling  ap. 160-164.  aThe effects of different levels of carbon limitation on the flower development of custard apple were studied in two defoliation experiments. The duration of flower development was unaffected by moderate carbon limitation, but increased with severe limitation. Both moderate and severe limitation caused a decrease in flower dry weight. Some of the data collected were combined with data from an earlier study to develop a model of the dependency of the duration of flower development on temperature. The model was applied to long-term weather records from Alstonville, northern New South Wales, to illustrate the effects of late 20th century warming on the duration of flower development.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAnnona cherimola 3aAnnona reticulata 3acarbon 3adefoliation 3aflowering 3aflowers 3amodels 3atemperature 3aweather 3aNew South Wales1 aMuldoon, Steven J.0 tAustralian journal of botany.g2012, v. 60, no. 2 p.160-164dCSIRO Publishingx0067-19247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1071/BT11299  aDNAL 7aarticle02125naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005300148245005600201300001800257500001100275520077400286592002801060650002301088650001701111650001401128650001001142650002001152650001801172650001301190650001701203650001301220650001301233650000901246700002101255700001901276700001601295700002301311700002301334700002001357700002001377700002001397700002101417773012501438856008301563852000901646655001201655IND60742401120221120161411.0220126e202108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074240112DNAL7 a10.1007/s12011-020-02437-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPal, Amit1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9916-330910aZinc and COVID-19: Basis of Current Clinical Trials  ap. 2882-2892.  aReview  aCoronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic continues to threaten patients, societies, and economic and healthcare systems around the world.

Zinc, one of the anti-inflammatory and antioxidant micronutrient found in food with well-established role in immunity, is currently being used in some clinical trials against COVID-19. This review integrates the contemporary studies of role of zinc in antiviral immunity along with discussing its potential role against COVID-19, and ongoing COVID-19 clinical trials using zinc.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCOVID-19 infection 3aantioxidants 3acytokines 3adeath 3ahealth services 3aimmune system 3aimmunity 3ainflammation 3apandemic 3aresearch 3azinc1 aSquitti, Rosanna1 aPicozza, Mario1 aPawar, Anil1 aRongioletti, Mauro1 aDutta, Atanu Kumar1 aSahoo, Sibasish1 aGoswami, Kalyan1 aSharma, Praveen1 aPrasad, Rajendra0 tBiological trace element research.g2021 Aug., v. 199, no. 8 p.2882-2892dSpringer USwJournal:jnl11497x0163-49847nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12011-020-02437-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02087naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001800145245011700163300001800280520091100298592002801209650002401237650002501261650002801286650001001314650001601324650001201340650001201352650002001364650001101384650001301395650002601408650000901434700001701443700001701460700001901477773010501496856007901601852000901680655001201689IND60347001820221118032155.0150812e201506  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6034700182DNAL7 a10.1111/1462-2920.127572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSon, Hokyoung10aFss1 is involved in the regulation of an ENA5 homologue for sodium and lithium tolerance in Fusarium graminearum  ap. 2048-2063.  aSodium is an abundant cation required for protein function and maintenance of cellular osmotic homeostasis. High concentrations of sodium are toxic, and fungi have evolved efficient sodium efflux systems. In this study, we characterized a novel sodium tolerance mechanism in the plant pathogen Fusarium graminearum. Fusarium graminearum sodium sensitive 1 (Fss1) is a nuclear transcription factor with a Zn(II)‚ÇÇCys‚ÇÜ fungal‚Äêtype DNA‚Äêbinding domain required for sodium tolerance. RNA‚Äêseq and genetic studies revealed that a P‚Äêtype ATPase pump, exitus natru (Latin: exit sodium) 1 (FgEna5), mediates the phenotypic defects of FSS1 mutants. A homologue of PACC (PAC1) was required for FgEna5‚Äêdependent sodium and lithium tolerance independent of Fss1.

Gasification is considered as a good option for conversion of the low-value asphaltenes into syngas. Syngas can later be used in the generation of steam for steam-assisted gravity drainage, and the hydrogen from the syngas can be used for upgrading. Understanding the decomposition of asphaltenes, the subsequent formation of soot, and the properties of soot enables optimization of the process of asphaltene gasification. In this work, the effects of feed particle size, temperature, and residence time on the formation of soot particles during the pyrolysis of Athabasca oil sand asphaltenes were investigated. Morphological, structural, and elemental properties of collected soot were also investigated. The experiments were carried out in an atmospheric entrained-flow reactor that was electrically heated to a range of set temperatures between 800 and 1400 ¬∞C, and the residence time was varied between 5 to 12 s by controlling the carrier gas nitrogen flow rate. The pyrolysis products were air-cooled in the collection probe after the reactor and passed through a cyclone to separate out particles larger than 10 Œºm. The particles smaller than 10 Œºm were subsequently passed through a cascade impactor for segregation of soot and ash particles in the size range from 0.03 to 3 Œºm. It was found that asphaltenes devolatilize to produce char, light gases, and tar. The different feed particle size ranges used in this study had a negligible effect on the analyzed properties of the soot. The yield of soot formed increased with the pyrolysis temperature. It was observed that the average size of primary soot particles decreases with an increase in temperature. The sulfur and hydrogen contents of soot decrease with temperature as a result of the liberation of sulfur as hydrogen sulfide during the pyrolysis reactions. With increasing residence time, the average size of the primary soot particles increases.  aPublisher supplied data 3abitumen 3adrainage 3agasification 3agravity 3ahydrogen 3ahydrogen sulfide 3anitrogen 3aparticle size 3apyrolysis 3asoot 3asteam 3asulfur 3asynthesis gas 3atemperature1 aMahapatra, Nirlipt1 aWang, Ben1 aAlipour, Mehdi1 aMartens, Frans1 aGupta, Rajender0 tEnergy & Fuels.g2015 Oct. 15, v. 29, no. 10 p.6823-6831dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-50297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.energyfuels.5b017163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02678naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245011900171300001600290520145300306592002801759650002301787650001001810650002001820650000901840650001601849650001701865650003001882650001101912650001201923700002801935700002301963700002401986700002702010700002602037700002402063773009902087856008502186852000902271655001202280IND60080880320221119084917.0140812e201307  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008088032DNAL7 a10.1016/j.exppara.2013.03.0272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFaccio, Luciana10aSusceptibility of Brazilian isolates of Trypanosoma evansi to suramin sodium: Test in experimentally infected mice  ap. 309-312.  aThis study aimed to evaluate the susceptibility of Brazilian isolates of Trypanosoma evansi to suramin sodium. For this purpose, three isolates of T. evansi (LPV-2005, LPV-2009 and LPV-2010) and seventy mice were used, with the animals divided in 10 groups (A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I and J) with seven animals each group. Mice of groups A, B, and C were infected with LPV-2005; Groups D, E and F with LPV-2009 and the groups G, H and I with LPV-2010. The group J was composed by healthy mice or uninfected. The parasitemia was monitored daily through blood smear, and the treatment of all groups was performed three days post-infection (PI), when all mice showed increased parasitemia. Groups A, D and G represented the positives controls, while groups B, E and H received a single dose of suramin sodium at 10mgkg‚Åª¬π intramuscularly. Groups C, F and I were treated with three doses of suramin sodium at 10mgkg‚Åª¬π, respecting an interval of 24h between each dose. Negative blood smears from all animals were obtained 24h after treatment (AT), status maintained until the end of the experiment (50days PI). The specific PCR for T. evansi was carried out from blood, showing negative results AT. Therefore, this study showed that a single dose of suramin sodium at 10mgkg‚Åª¬π has the same efficacy of three doses, as recommended by the therapeutic literature. Furthermore, we observed that Brazilian isolates did not show resistance to the drug.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTrypanosoma evansi 3ablood 3adrug resistance 3amice 3aparasitemia 3aparasitology 3apolymerase chain reaction 3asodium 3asuramin1 aDa Silva, Aleksandro S.1 aGressler, Lucas T.1 aTonin, Alexandre A.1 aLazzarotto, C√≠cera R.1 aMiletti, Luiz Claudio1 aMonteiro, Silvia G.0 tExperimental parasitology.g2013 July, v. 134, no. 3 p.309-312dElsevier Inc.x0014-48947nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.exppara.2013.03.0273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01317naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001600140245005700156300002000213520028800233592002800521650002700549650002200576650002300598650002800621650001200649650001900661650000700680700001200687700001900699700001500718700001500733773013600748856007400884852000900958655001200967IND60661057820221118161740.0190827e20150730xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066105782DNAL7 a10.1039/c5cc05251c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Jieling10apH responsive ATP carriers to drive kinesin movement  ap. 13044-13046.  aMultilayer film coated CaCO‚ÇÉ microspheres were employed as pH responsive ATP carriers to drive kinesin movement.

It is found that, during the period 1958‚Äì78, El Ni√±o generates an anomalous Aleutian low in the mid troposphere extending from northeastern Eurasia to the northeastern Pacific with the most significant center in the northwestern Pacific. The anomalous Aleutian low results in a marked increase in planetary wavenumber 1 but a weak decrease in wavenumber 2 from the upper troposphere to lower stratosphere. The Eliassen‚ÄìPalm (EP) flux of planetary waves converges at the high latitudes in the stratosphere and brings about a significantly weakened polar vortex. In contrast, during the period 1979‚Äì2015, the wintertime El Ni√±o-related Aleutian low shifts eastward into the northeastern Pacific. This variation in tropospheric El Ni√±o teleconnection leads to a dramatic decrease in planetary wavenumber 2 but a relatively weak increase in wavenumber 1. Furthermore, the magnitude of the decrease of wavenumber-2 EP flux is comparable to the increase of wavenumber-1 EP flux in the stratosphere. Consequently, the stratospheric response lessens dramatically, showing a less disturbed and slightly enhanced polar vortex. The lessened stratospheric response is quite obvious in the stratosphere below 10¬†hPa regardless of the long-term trend being removed or not, indicating a dominant role of El Ni√±o in the wintertime variability of lower polar stratosphere.  aPublisher supplied data  a41505034cNSFC  a41575057, 41490643cNSFC  a2015CB453200cChina National 973 project 3aEl Nino 3alatitude 3astratosphere 3atroposphere 3awinter 3aEurasia1 aLi, Tim1 aXu, Haiming1 aYang, Shuangyan0 tClimate dynamics.g2017 July, v. 49, no. 1-2 p.263-278dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl3895934x0930-75757nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00382-016-3340-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03108naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002000140245006000160300002000220500001400240520154200254592002801796650001501824650001501839650001301854650001201867650001101879650001401890650001101904650002701915650001501942650000901957650001101966650003301977650001202010650001102022650001202033650002902045650001702074650000902091650001202100650002602112650001002138650001902148650001702167650001102184650001202195650001102207650001702218650001902235650001102254650002002265650001302285773012502298856007402423852000902497655001202506IND60708593720221122080216.0200828e20200826xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070859372DNAL7 a10.1039/d0ra06422j2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPatel, Himanshu10aEnvironmental valorisation of bagasse fly ash: a review  ap. 31611-31621.  aNAL-light  aWorldwide, each year the sugar industry generates bagasse fly ash (BFA) in the process of producing sugar including ethanol and jaggery. With the increasing average value of 2% consumption of sugar per annum, the quantity of solid waste BFA continuously increases and creates environmental problems. The valorisation of BFA is a convenient and sustainable means for decreasing the environmental burden. This paper aims to review the various important analyses and valorisation of BFA. BFA is a porous material and has oxides of several elements, such as silicon, aluminium, iron, sodium and other metals. Based on some of its excellent properties, untreated and modified BFA can represent an important source in different fields. Metals, dyes, petrochemicals, insecticides and other contaminants can be adsorbed using BFA, where the maximum adsorption capacities can be described using different adsorption variables and isotherms. It is convenient and a sustainable resolution to use traditional adsorbents for water treatment. This also decreases the environmental solid burden, eventually reducing greenhouse gas emissions. This ash has been incorporated into different construction materials, including cement and brick in different percentages to enhance their mechanical characteristics and durability, thus maintaining economic and environmental sustainability. Also, several products such as zeolites, silica, briquette catalyst and other important materials, which are promising energy sources, have been prepared using the BFA.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3aaluminum 3abagasse 3abricks 3acatalysts 3acement 3aconstruction materials 3adurability 3adyes 3aenergy 3aenvironmental sustainability 3aethanol 3afields 3afly ash 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3ainsecticides 3airon 3ajaggery 3amechanical properties 3apaper 3apetrochemicals 3aporous media 3asilica 3asilicon 3asodium 3asolid wastes 3asugar industry 3asugars 3awater treatment 3azeolites0 tRSC advances.g2020 Aug. 26, v. 10, no. 52 p.31611-31621dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d0ra06422j3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02739naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001500151245016400166520138900330592002801719650001301747650002101760650001601781650001801797650001701815650002101832650001301853650001601866650000901882650001401891650001501905653003301920653001101953653002401964653002701988700002402015700001802039700002302057700001902080773011102099856008602210852000902296655001202305IND60714117520221119213201.0220103e202011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071411752DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodres.2020.1097282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLoarce, L.10aImplementation of subcritical water extraction with natural deep eutectic solvents for sustainable extraction of phenolic compounds from winemaking by-products  aIn attempt to recover valuable phenolic compounds from grape pomace by-products, a new implemented methodology has been proposed. The subcritical water extraction technique has been implemented with the use of emerging eco-solvents such as natural deep eutectic solvents (NADESs). The extraction efficiency of different NADESs were screened. Among them, choline chloride containing urea as hydrogen bond donor was selected (ChClU). However, due to pressurised system and the viscosity of NADESs, ChClU could not be used as truly solvent but as a solvent modifier in an promising percentage of 30%. The optimum extraction temperature for the isolation of phenolic compounds was 100¬†¬∞C since extractions above this temperature implied the loss of the original composition of grape pomace due to thermaldegradation reactions and neoformation of Maillard compounds. The employ of subcritical water combined with 30% of ChClU led to a significant rise of extracted phenolic compounds quantities in comparison with the solely use of subcritical water. Among them, the extraction of catechin and epicatechin suffered an increase of 45.05 and 47.98% respectively, so this implementation led to highly efficient and truly eco-friendly extraction method. The implementation of subcritical water with NADESs to extract valuable compounds from winery by-products has not been applied until now.  aPublisher supplied data 3acatechin 3acholine chloride 3aepicatechin 3afood research 3agrape pomace 3ahydrogen bonding 3asolvents 3atemperature 3aurea 3aviscosity 3awinemaking 0aSubcritical water extraction 0aNADESs 0aBioactive compounds 0aWinemaking by-products1 aOliver-Simancas, R.1 aMarchante, L.1 aD√≠az-Maroto, M.C.1 aAla√±√≥n, M.E.0 tFood research international.g2020 Nov., v. 137 p.109728-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl48420x0963-99697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodres.2020.1097283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03172naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100006700150245008400217300001600301520168200317592002801999650001902027650001902046650001202065650001502077650002502092650001902117650001202136650001702148650002102165650001002186650002402196650001902220650001002239651001802249653002902267653001602296653002202312653002102334653001802355700006002373700005902433773011602492856008502608852000902693655001202702IND60625546620221119023034.0210114e20190215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062554662DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foreco.2018.11.0442doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLantschner, M.

Understanding the spatio-temporal patterns of eruptive insects can provide insights into the mechanisms driving their dynamics and help predict future responses under climate change. The aims of this study were to analyze the spatio-temporal patterns of outbreaks of the woodwasp Sirex noctilio ‚Äìa major invasive pest of pines‚Äì in an invaded region of South America, to assess the relative importance of density-dependent and density-independent mechanisms on population dynamics, and to identify the primary factors that influence the magnitude of outbreaks. We used tree ring and insect sampling data of more than 1000 trees to reconstruct S. noctilio outbreaks in 29 pine stands across Patagonia-Argentina over a 16-year period. We found marked spatial synchrony in S. noctilio outbreaks at a regional scale. Rates of tree mortality from S. noctilio were influenced by both density-dependent and density-independent factors. The occurrence of S. noctilio outbreaks are triggered by an abrupt increase in drought, which likely increases the availability of susceptible host trees. The damage caused by the outbreaks is determined by stand level variables, closely related with tree stress. Rates of tree mortality decreased over time due to negative density-dependence in S. noctilio populations, likely due to the loss of suitable resources over time. Depicting mechanisms of large-scale tree mortality in ecosystems provides insights to the drivers of forest outbreaks and other factors such as responses to a changing climate.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSirex noctilio 3aclimate change 3adrought 3aecosystems 3aenvironmental impact 3aforest insects 3aforests 3agrowth rings 3ainsect outbreaks 3apests 3apopulation dynamics 3atree mortality 3atrees 3aSouth America 0aSpatio-temporal dynamics 0aForest pest 0aSpatial synchrony 0aInvasive species 0aGlobal change1 aAukema, Brian H.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4370-04991 aCorley, Juan C.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8032-22230 tForest ecology and management.g2019 Feb. 15, v. 433 p.762-770dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl9013x0378-11277nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2018.11.0443Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03083naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245014300165300001800308520134400326592002801670596008401698650002601782650001201808650001501820650001301835650000901848650001601857650001401873650002101887650000901908650000901917650001301926653002801939653002301967653002101990653001402011653002802025653001502053700001502068700001302083700001402096700001602110700001502126700001602141700001802157700002402175700002102199700001402220700005602234773013502290856008302425852000902508655001202517IND60758684820221117040651.0211202e20210820xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075868482DNAL7 a10.1094/PDIS-07-20-1501-RE2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCheng, Wanli10aControl of Meloidogyne incognita in Three-Dimensional Model Systems and Pot Experiments by the Attract-and-Kill Effect of Furfural Acetone  ap. 2169-2176.  aMeloidogyne incognita causes large-scale losses of agricultural crops worldwide. The natural metabolite furfural acetone has been reported to attract and kill M. incognita, but whether the attractant and nematicidal activities of furfural acetone on M. incognita function simultaneously in the same system, especially in three-dimensional spaces or in soil, is still unknown. Here, we used 23% Pluronic F-127 gel and a soil simulation device to demonstrate that furfural acetone has a significant attract-and-kill effect on M. incognita in both three-dimensional model systems. At 24 h, the chemotaxis index and the corrected mortality of nematodes exposed to 60 mg/ml of furfural acetone in 23% Pluronic F-127 gel were as high as 0.82 and 74.44%, respectively. Soil simulation experiments in moist sand showed that at 48 h, the chemotaxis index and the corrected mortality of the nematode toward furfural acetone reached 0.63 and 82.12%, respectively, and the effect persisted in the presence of tomato plants. In choice experiments, nematodes selected furfural acetone over plant roots and were subsequently killed. In pot studies, furfural acetone had a control rate of 82.80% against M.¬†incognita. Collectively, these results provide compelling evidence for further investigation of furfural acetone as a novel nematode control agent.  aPublisher supplied data  a2017ABA072cMajor Projects of Technological Innovation in Hubei Province, China 3aMeloidogyne incognita 3aacetone 3achemotaxis 3afurfural 3agels 3ametabolites 3amortality 3anematode control 3asand 3asoil 3atomatoes 0aattract-and-kill effect 0adisease management 0afurfural acetone 0anematodes 0athree-dimensional model 0avegetables1 aChen, Zhen1 aZeng, Li1 aYang, Xue1 aHuang, Dian1 aZhai, Yile1 aCai, Minmin1 aZheng, Longyu1 aThomashow, Linda S.1 aWeller, David M.1 aYu, Ziniu1 aZhang, Jibin1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0788-557X0 tPlant disease.g2021 Aug. 20, v. 105, no. 8 p.2169-2176dThe American Phytopathological SocietywJournal:jnl30858x0191-29177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1094/PDIS-07-20-1501-RE3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03268naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001300147245013300160300001600293500002000309520176200329592002802091596006302119596005602182650001602238650001502254650002302269650001002292650002202302650000902324650001202333650001502345650001802360650001702378650001402395650001402409650002202423651001002445700001202455700001502467700001802482700002202500700006002522773011302582856008202695852000902777655001202786IND60588946820221122225503.0220815e201801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058894682DNAL7 a10.1007/s11284-017-1531-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Bo10aTree diversity has contrasting effects on predation rates by birds and arthropods on three broadleaved, subtropical tree species  ap. 205-212.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aPlant diversity is hypothesized to strengthen biological control by promoting top‚Äêdown pressure of predators on herbivores. However, studies on the effects of plant diversity on actual predation rates are still scarce, particularly in forest ecosystems. We analyzed the effect of tree species richness, and the potential influence of neighbor tree density, on predation rates of arthropods and birds on artificial clay caterpillars in a large‚Äêscale forest biodiversity experiment in south‚Äêeast China. Our study was focused on three broadleaved tree species that are frequently damaged by lepidopteran caterpillars. Predation rates were influenced by tree species richness on only one of the three tree species, on which arthropod predation increased and bird predation decreased with increasing tree species richness. Importantly, these relationships were mediated by neighbor tree density, being most pronounced when focal trees had fewer surrounding neighbor trees. Our findings indicate that low tree density reduced arthropod predator abundances and predation rates, but that negative effects of this reduction were compensated for in more diverse tree mixtures by a functionally more diverse predator community. In contrast, lower tree densities might have benefited insectivorous birds by making trees more accessible particularly in monocultures, which are often structurally more uniform and denser than tree mixtures. Overall, our results point to an important role of species‚Äêspecific and density‚Äêdependent mechanisms in modifying the consequences of biodiversity loss on top‚Äêdown effects in forest ecosystems. Future work should aim at separating the effects of different predator guilds and those of host diversity from host density.  aPublisher supplied data  aDFG FOR 891/1, 891/2 and 891/3cGerman Research Foundation  cGerman Centre for Integrative Biodiversity Research 3aLepidoptera 3aarthropods 3abiological control 3abirds 3abroadleaved trees 3aclay 3aforests 3aherbivores 3ainsect larvae 3ainsectivores 3apredation 3apredators 3aspecies diversity 3aChina1 aLi, Bin1 aHe, Yuxuan1 aZhang, Lipeng1 aBruelheide, Helge1 aSchuldt, Andreas1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8761-00250 tEcological research.g2018 Jan., v. 33, no. 1 p.205-212dSpringer JapanwJournal:jnl3870047x0912-38147nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11284-017-1531-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02322naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245008600167300001600253520109700269592002801366650001301394650002401407650002501431650002901456650002601485650001201511650001301523650001401536650001301550650000901563650002501572653000901597653000801606653001801614653001001632653002401642700002201666773012101688856008201809852000901891655001201900IND60089732220221119142008.0160728e20130419xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008973222DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbrc.2013.02.1062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKato, Yukinari10aGeneration of a novel monoclonal antibody WMab-1 specific for IDH2-R172W mutation  ap. 374-378.  aIsocitrate dehydrogenase 2 (IDH2) mutations have been detected in gliomas, cartilaginous tumors, and acute myeloid leukemias. IDH2 mutations are specific to a single codon in the conserved and functionally important Arginine 172 (R172) or Arginine 140 (R140). To date, we have established specific monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against IDH2-R172K and IDH2-R172M. However, specific mAbs against IDH2-R172W have not been reported. To establish IDH2-R172W-specific mAbs, we immunized rats with IDH2-R172W peptides. Western-blot analysis showed that WMab-1 reacted with the IDH2-R172W recombinant protein, not with IDH2-wild type (WT) or other IDH2 mutants, indicating that WMab-1 is IDH2-R172W-specific. Furthermore, WMab-1 specifically stained the IDH2-R172W-expressing cells in immunocytochemistry, but did not stain IDH2-WT and IDH2-R172M-containing cells. WMab-1 also specifically stained the IDH2-R172W-expressing glioma cells in immunohistochemistry. This is the first report to establish an anti-IDH2-R172W-specific mAb, which could be useful in the diagnosis of IDH2-R172W-bearing tumors.  aPublisher supplied data 3aarginine 3aimmunocytochemistry 3aimmunohistochemistry 3aisocitrate dehydrogenase 3amonoclonal antibodies 3amutants 3amutation 3aneoplasms 3apeptides 3arats 3arecombinant proteins 0aIDH2 0amAb 0aIDH2 mutation 0aR172W 0aMonoclonal antibody1 aKaneko, Mika Kato0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2013 Apr. 19, v. 433 p.374-378dElsevier Inc.x0006-291X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2013.02.1063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03402naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245014900166300001600315520203100331592002802362650002502390650001502415650002602430650001102456650002602467650001102493650002502504650002502529650001802554650001002572650002102582650001402603650002702617650001102644651001102655653001502666653001302681653001002694653001402704653001302718700001602731773009202747856008402839852000902923655001202932IND60566825220221117172948.0170709s2017    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056682522DNAL7 a10.1016/j.proenv.2017.03.1572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNtasiou, M.14aThe Standard of Industrial Symbiosis.

The companies involved aim at reducing production costs by increasing the efficiency of materials and energy and recycling byproducts / waste. The establishment of an EnvironmentalIndustrial Park promotes the use of new environmentally friendly technologies, structures and infrastructure and reduces the sources of pollution and waste. The application of industrial ecology and eco-industry networks remains in an early stage in Greece. The Greek legislation does not incorporate or define Environmental Industrial Parks and the standard of ‚Äúindustrial symbiosis‚Äù has not yet been implemented.The paper examines the ‚Äúindustrial symbiosis‚Äù standard, through international practices and existing implemented examples. Also, the paper examines the principles, conditions and design criteria in locating a manufacturing / industrial park in accordance with environmental standards and legislation. A case study is being presented involving the proposal for siting and design of a BusinessPark in the municipality of Pili, Greece,with implementation of environmental criteria.A methodology of establishing the B.P. is being applied with emphasis on location criteria, since issues such as geographic proximity and spatial principles are considered to be of high importance. The methodology comprises certain steps, which examine the elements of the natural and human environment. An evaluation of alternative locationsis carried out, which results in the final evaluation of the selected location. Finally, the compatibility of the location selectedin relation to the elements of the natural and human environmentis being assessed. The principles of industrial symbiosis are also applied through certain proposals for saving and reuse of energy, water, materials / by-products / waste and reducing the environmental burden.  aPublisher supplied data 3abusiness enterprises 3abyproducts 3aeconomic productivity 3aenergy 3aenvironmental factors 3ahumans 3aindustrial symbiosis 3alaws and regulations 3amanufacturing 3aparks 3aproduction costs 3arecycling 3asustainable technology 3awastes 3aGreece 0aIndustrial 0aBusiness 0aParks 0aSymbiosis 0aStandard1 aAndreou, E.0 tProcedia Environmental Sciences.g2017, v. 38 p.744-751dElsevier B.V.x1878-02967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.proenv.2017.03.1573Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02469naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002000152245006300172300001800235520103600253592002801289650001301317650001801330650002501348650001201373650002201385650001101407650001701418650001701435650000901452650001201461650001601473650002301489650001701512650002201529653002501551653001601576653001101592653002801603653001701631700002301648700001801671700001901689700001201708700001701720700001601737773010201753856008701855852000901942655001201951IND60571020220221119115529.0190402e20171215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057102022DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2017.06.0682doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 a ªAlƒ´, Barkat,10aSoymilk-Cow‚Äôs milk ACE-inhibiting enzyme modified cheese  ap. 1083-1091.  aIn present study, we developed and optimized soymilk-cow‚Äôs milk enzyme-modified cheese with angiotensin-I converting enzyme inhibitory activity.

Higher drying temperatures resulted in cheese powder with weak thermal stability and lower browning indices. Experiments aimed at optimizing thermal stability and physical properties revealed that optimal conditions for producing cheese powder were an inlet air temperature of 150¬∞C, a feeding rate of 10%, and an air flow rate of 600Lh‚àí1. Moreover, in addition to flavour, the bioactive cheese powders produced from a combination of soymilk-cow‚Äôs milk are of potential source and can be used in the dietary management of hypertension.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair flow 3aangiotensin I 3abioactive properties 3acheeses 3aenzyme inhibition 3aflavor 3ahydrolysates 3ahypertension 3amilk 3apowders 3aproteolysis 3asorption isotherms 3aspray drying 3athermal stability 0aSoymilk-Cow‚Äôs milk 0aFlavourzyme 0aCheese 0aACE-inhibitory activity 0aSpray drying1 aKhan, Kiran Yasmin1 aMajeed, Hamid1 aAbid, Mohamed,1 aXu, Lei1 aWu, Fengfeng1 aXu, Xueming0 tFood chemistry.g2017 Dec. 15, v. 237 p.1083-1091dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8139x0308-81467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2017.06.0683Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03025naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002200151245019300173300001600366520144500382592002801827650002501855650001401880650001801894650001001912650001501922650003601937650001701973650000801990650001701998650001702015650003902032650001502071650000902086650003302095650001202128650003902140650002202179650001402201653002502215653000902240700001702249700001602266700002102282773013302303856008602436852000902522655001202531IND60773345320221121055906.0220413e20220401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077334532DNAL7 a10.1080/10826068.2021.19525972doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEczacioglu, Numan10aInvestigation of mutations (L41F, F17M, N57E, Y99F_Y134W) effects on the TolAIII-UnaG fluorescence protein's unconjugated bilirubin (UC-BR) binding ability and thermal stability properties  ap. 365-374.  aThe UnaG protein is a ligand (unconjugated bilirubin) dependent fluorescence protein isolated from Unagi freshwater eel larvae and expressed as fusion in heterologous expression systems. Bilirubin is a tetrapyrrole molecule mainly produced from heme catabolism by the destruction of erythrocytes in the body. Bilirubin can cause kernicterus, a serious condition associated with permanent neurological damage in neonates with the passage of brain tissue. Different methods have been developed for plasma bilirubin analysis and quantification. The use of UnaG fluorescence protein triggered by bilirubin has become a new approach in bilirubin studies. In this study, we aimed to investigate the biophysical characterization of ligand interactions with the proteins obtained as a result of mutations (UnaGY‚Åπ‚ÅπF_Y¬π¬≥‚Å¥·µÇ, UnaG·¥∫‚Åµ‚Å∑·¥±, UnaG·¥∏‚Å¥¬πF, and UnaGF¬π‚Å∑·¥π) on the amino acid sequence of TolAIII-UnaG protein. After the purity levels of the expressed proteins have been analyzed by SDS-PAGE, secondary structures and thermal melting temperatures of the proteins have been examined by circular dichroism spectroscopy. Then determination of excitation and emission points by fluorescence spectroscopy, titration studies have been performed with bilirubin, and dissociation constant was calculated. According to the biophysical characterization studies, UnaG·¥∏‚Å¥¬πF has the highest affinity and stability among the mutants.  aPublisher supplied data 3aamino acid sequences 3abilirubin 3abiotechnology 3abrain 3acatabolism 3acircular dichroism spectroscopy 3adissociation 3aeel 3aerythrocytes 3afluorescence 3afluorescence emission spectroscopy 3afreshwater 3aheme 3aheterologous gene expression 3aligands 3apolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 3athermal stability 3atitration 0afluorescence protein 0aUnaG1 aUlusu, Yakup1 aGokce, ƒ∞sa1 aLakey, Jeremy H.0 tPreparative biochemistry & biotechnology.g2022 Apr. 1, v. 52, no. 4 p.365-374dTaylor & FranciswJournal:12249x1532-22977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10826068.2021.19525973Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03384naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094024002200122024001900144040001800163100001500181245016000196300001800356500002000374506007600394520176900470592002802239506003702267650001502304650001602319650002402335650000902359650003502368650001102403650002002414650002002434650001902454700001402473700001402487700001502501700001502516700001302531700001902544700001602563700001502579700001402594700001502608700001902623773014102642856007402783852000902857655001202866IND60587430720221207122358.0180102e201707  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058743072DNAL7 a10.1111/jvim.147742doi7 aPMC55083522pmcid7 a286085772pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFlorey, J.10aUse of a Granulocyte Immunofluorescence Assay Designed for Humans for Detection of Antineutrophil Cytoplasmic Antibodies in Dogs with Chronic Enteropathies  ap. 1062-1066.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Perinuclear antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (pANCA) previously have been shown to be serum markers in dogs with chronic enteropathies, with dogs that have food‚Äêresponsive disease (FRD) having higher frequencies of seropositivity than dogs with steroid‚Äêresponsive disease (SRD). The indirect immunofluorescence (IIF) assay used in previous publications is time‚Äêconsuming to perform, with low interobserver agreement. HYPOTHESIS/OBJECTIVES: We hypothesized that a commercially available granulocyte IIF assay designed for humans could be used to detect perinuclear antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies in dogs. ANIMALS: Forty‚Äêfour dogs with FRD, 20 dogs with SRD, 20 control dogs, and 38 soft‚Äêcoated wheaten terrier (SCWT) or SCWT‚Äêcross dogs. METHODS: A granulocyte assay designed for humans was used to detect pANCA, cANCA, and antinuclear antibodies (ANA), as well as antibodies against proteinase‚Äê3 protein (PR‚Äê3) and myeloperoxidase protein (MPO) in archived serum samples. RESULTS: Sensitivity of the granulocyte assay to predict FRD in dogs was 0.61 (95% confidence interval (CI), 0.45, 0.75), and specificity was 1.00 (95% CI, 0.91, 1.00). A significant association was identified between positive pANCA or cANCA result and diagnosis of FRD (P < 0.0001). Agreement between the two assays to detect ANCA in the same serum samples from SCWT with protein‚Äêlosing enteropathy/protein‚Äêlosing nephropathy (PLE/PLN) was substantial (kappa, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.53, 1.00). Eight ANCA‚Äêpositive cases were positive for MPO or PR‚Äê3 antibodies. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: The granulocyte immunofluorescence assay used in our pilot study was easy and quick to perform. Agreement with the previously published method was good.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aantibodies 3ablood serum 3aconfidence interval 3adogs 3afluorescent antibody technique 3ahumans 3akidney diseases 3amyeloperoxidase 3aseroprevalence1 aViall, A.1 aStreu, S.1 aDiMuro, V.1 aRiddle, A.1 aKirk, J.1 aPerazzotti, L.1 aAffeldt, K.1 aWagner, R.1 aVaden, S.1 aHarris, T.1 aAllenspach, K.0 tJournal of veterinary internal medicine.g2017 July, v. 31, no. 4 p.1062-1066dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl43440x0891-66407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jvim.147743Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02780naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245004600169300001600215520158700231592002801818650002601846650001501872650001301887650001001900650001201910650001401922650001101936650001101947650001101958650001701969650002001986650001102006650001602017651002102033653003402054653002202088653002702110700002402137773009202161856008402253852000902337655001202346IND60566825320221117172940.0170709s2017    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056682532DNAL7 a10.1016/j.proenv.2017.03.1582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFamily, Roxana10aMaterials for Radiative Cooling: A Review  ap. 752-759.  aBuildings use more than one-third of the total energy consumed in counties within the Mediterranean climate zones like in Turkey. During the summer months, the absorption of solar energy by the buildings increases the required cooling load significantly. One unconventional solution to this problem is the radiative cooling of the building surfaces and fa√ßades. If a surface benefits from daytime radiative cooling, its equilibrium temperature will be lower. This can be achieved only if 88% of solar radiation within the visible and near-infrared spectrum is reflected. For this purpose, paints and coatings may have an obvious advantage because of their low cost, simplicity and ease of application;however, strong solar reflectors may significantly mutate the color. On the other hand, the use of spectrally selective surfaces isof great value in practical applications such as collection of solar energy and spacecraft temperature control. In addition, the development of novel nano-patterning techniques and new designer materials for various applications are likely to surface. These developments may help to develop a wider data base for spectral and directional radiative properties of different materials. This review is to provide an overview of mainstream and such as cermets, paints and coatings, and metal oxides that can be used for radiative cooling of buildings. Also, a summary is provided for the theories, fabrication methods, usual design and possible future research opportunities to optimize these materials for spectral selectivity for specific applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMediterranean climate 3aabsorption 3acoatings 3acolor 3acooling 3adatabases 3aenergy 3aoxides 3apaints 3asolar energy 3asolar radiation 3asummer 3atemperature 3aTurkey (country) 0aSpectrally-selective surfaces 0aRadiative cooling 0aSustainable buildings.1 aMeng√º√ß, M.

The concept was successfully demonstrated in different laminates with high strength and high modulus carbon and S-glass epoxy UD prepregs. The novel hybrid architecture provided pseudo-ductile tensile stress‚Äìstrain responses with a linear initial part followed by a wide plateau and a second linear part, all connected by smooth transitions. The best hybrid configuration showed 60% improvement in modulus compared to pure glass, 860MPa plateau stress and 2% pseudo-ductile strain.

In particular, the possibility of suppressing the Jahn‚ÄìTeller distortion of d‚Åπ Cu centers with applied pressure has been debated over a number of decades. We studied the structural and electronic changes resulting from the application of pressures up to ca. 60 GPa on a two-dimensional copper(II)‚Äìchloride perovskite using diamond anvil cells (DACs), through a combination of in situ powder X-ray diffraction, electronic absorption and vibrational spectroscopy, dc resistivity measurements, and optical observations. Our measurements show that compression of this charge-transfer insulator initially yields a first-order structural phase transition at ca. 4 GPa similar to previous reports on other Cu·¥µ·¥µ‚ÄìCl perovskites, during which the originally translucent yellow solid turns red. Further compression induces a previously unreported phase transition at ca. 8 GPa and dramatic piezochromism from translucent red-orange to opaque black. Two-probe dc resistivity measurements conducted within the DAC show the first instance of appreciable conductivity in Cu·¥µ·¥µ‚ÄìCl perovskites. The conductivity increases by 5 orders of magnitude between 7 and 50 GPa, with a maximum measured conductivity of 2.9 √ó 10‚Äì‚Å¥ S¬∑cm‚Äì¬π at 51.4 GPa. Electronic absorption spectroscopy and variable-temperature conductivity measurements indicate that the perovskite behaves as a 1.0 eV band-gap semiconductor at 39.7 GPa and has an activation energy for electronic conduction of 0.232(1) eV at 40.2 GPa. Remarkably, all these changes are reversible: the material reverts to a translucent yellow solid upon decompression, and ambient pressure powder X-ray diffraction data taken before and after compression up to 60 GPa show that the original structure is maintained with minimal hysteresis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3aabsorption 3aactivation energy 3acopper 3ahybrids 3ahysteresis 3aphase transition 3asemiconductors 3aspectroscopy1 aLin, Yu1 aMao, Wendy L.1 aKarunadasa, Hemamala I.0 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2015 Feb. 04, v. 137, no. 4 p.1673-1678dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fja512396m3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04063naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100006800150245011000218300001600328500001500344520241500359592002802774650001102802650001802813650001602831650001102847650001602858650001902874650002102893650003202914650001002946650002102956650001602977650001702993650001703010650002003027650002903047650002103076650001403097651001303111653001603124653002103140653003303161653002003194653001503214653002403229700002203253700003603275773011603311856008503427852000903512655001203521IND60625546920221119023235.0190403e20190228xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062554692DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foreco.2018.12.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLobo, Guilherme de Sousa1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0909-963910aResponse of black-water floodplain (igap√≥) forests to flood pulse regulation in a dammed Amazonian river  ap. 110-118.  a2019-12-06  aThe monomodal flood pulse of major Amazonian rivers is a seasonal phenomenon that determines ecological and biogeochemical processes in adjacent floodplain forests. River damming transforms the pattern of downstream flood pulses and provides a natural disturbance to which the native biota might be poorly adapted. Severe modifications of the flood pulse were recorded in the Uatum√£ River after the installation of the Balbina dam, Central Amazonia. Flood pulse regulation increased mortality of flood-adapted species in the black-water floodplain (igap√≥) forest. No previous studies have investigated impacts of flood pulse regulation on the species composition and forest structure of igap√≥ forests. Therefore, we examined species composition and forest structure of igap√≥ forests along a regulated river in comparison to a pristine tributary, the Abacate River, evaluating soil texture characteristics and flood duration. In order to assess potential encroachment of species less sensitive to flood alteration, we also inventoried adjacent non-flooded upland forest in each river section. A quantitative inventory of all trees with diameter at breast height (DBH) ‚â•5‚ÄØcm was carried out in low-igap√≥, high-igap√≥ and adjacent upland forests, totaling one half-hectare in each river. In both rivers investigated, the clay fraction of the soil was significantly related to tree height. Flood duration was correlated to DBH and basal area, with the largest trees found in low-igap√≥ forests which are exposed to long-term flooding. Species composition, richness and diversity significantly responded to flood duration. Species richness was highest in upland forests and lowest in low-igap√≥ forest. In the pristine river, tree species composition exhibited a turnover of species along the flooding gradient. In the regulated river, flood intensification in the low-igap√≥ forest increased dominance of a few flood-adapted species, which produced floristic dissimilarity to all forest types investigated. On the other hand, high-igap√≥ forest showed higher floristic similarity with upland forest due to flood suppression that contributed to encroachment of species commonly described in secondary upland forests. Our results emphasize the urgent need for Brazilian environmental regulatory agencies to incorporate downstream impacts in the environmental assessments of dam projects in the Amazon Basin.  aPublisher supplied data 3abasins 3aclay fraction 3ainventories 3arivers 3atree height 3aupland forests 3aspecies richness 3atree and stand measurements 3atrees 3adams (hydrology) 3afloodplains 3asoil texture 3aforest types 3abiogeochemistry 3aenvironmental assessment 3astand basal area 3amortality 3aAmazonia 0aBalbina dam 0aForest structure 0aAmazonian floodplain forests 0aRegulated river 0abasal area 0aSpecies composition1 aWittmann, Florian1 aPiedade, Maria Teresa Fernandez0 tForest ecology and management.g2019 Feb. 28, v. 434 p.110-118dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl9013x0378-11277nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2018.12.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03549naa a2200673 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002000145245011400165300001800279520137500297592002801672596011101700596008301811596006501894596005701959596005902016650002102075650001902096650001102115650002502126650001202151650002302163650001302186650001502199650001502214650001102229650002602240650002602266650001802292650001902310650001102329650001002340650002102350650001502371650000902386650001002395651001002405653001202415653002102427653002002448653001802468653002302486653002002509700001502529700001802544700001702562700001402579700002002593700002002613700002202633773012002655856007902775852000902854655001202863IND60674346520221118115054.0191025e20180511xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067434652DNAL7 a10.1093/treephys/tpy0462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuang, Jian-Guo10aIntra-annual wood formation of subtropical Chinese red pine shows better growth in dry season than wet season  ap. 1225-1236.  aChina's subtropical forests play a vital role in sequestering global carbon; therefore, it is critical to conduct a precise investigation of intra-annual wood formation in these ecosystems to clarify the mechanisms behind this. Two field experiments were established in Chinese subtropical forests to monitor weekly the intra-annual xylem formation of Pinus massoniana Lamb. from January to December 2015, using the recently developed micro-sampling approach. The effects of climate on wood formation were also assessed using linear or mixed models. Results indicate that there is an inactive period that might be semi-dormancy in subtropical pine ecosystems in January compared with the complete dormancy in temperate and boreal ecosystems and the fully active or short-term dormancy in tropical ecosystems. The duration of xylem formation of Chinese red pine in subtropical China in 2015 was 4‚Äì6 months longer than temperate and boreal forests. Moreover, trees were found to grow better during the dry season than the wet season, indicating that the Chinese red pine ecosystem is more strongly regulated by net energy than by environmental factors. Our findings indicate that China's subtropical pine forests may benefit from the expected longer dry seasons, possibly leading to better forest growth and improved carbon sequestration under continued climate warming.  aPublisher supplied data  a31570584a41661144007cNational Natural Science Foundation of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001809  aY421081001cChinese Academy of Sciencesdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100002367  aGJHZ1752cInternational Collaborative Key Project of the CAS  a2016A030313152cGuangdong Natural Science Foundation  a2015VBB032cCAS President‚Äôs International Fellowship 3aPinus massoniana 3aboreal forests 3acarbon 3acarbon sequestration 3aclimate 3aconiferous forests 3adormancy 3adry season 3aecosystems 3aenergy 3aenvironmental factors 3afield experimentation 3aforest growth 3aglobal warming 3amodels 3atrees 3atropical forests 3awet season 3awood 3axylem 3aChina 0acambium 0aChinese red pine 0ainactive period 0asemi-dormancy 0asubtropical forest 0axylem formation1 aGuo, Xiali1 aRossi, Sergio1 aZhai, Lihong1 aYu, Biyun1 aZhang, Shaokang1 aZhang, Mingfang1 aM√§kel√§, Annikki0 tTree physiology.g2018 May 11, v. 38, no. 8 p.1225-1236dOxford University PresswJournal:jnl41003x1758-44697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/treephys/tpy0463Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02202naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001600155245007500171300001600246520120400262592002801466650002401494650001201518650001801530650001101548650001101559653002401570653003001594653001801624653001801642700001701660773008901677856008901766852000901855655001201864IND60605084320221120163828.0180720e201505  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060508432DNAL7 a10.1016/j.compositesa.2015.01.0202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSimacek, P.10aSimulating tape resin infiltration during thermoset pultrusion process  ap. 115-126.  aThe thermoset tape pultrusion is a widely adopted manufacturing process to produce long, constant cross-section composite structural parts. For high volume production, low cost can be achieved by maximizing the production rate which is a function of the material and process parameters, more specifically the rate of resin infiltration and resin cure. During resin infiltration, the resin saturates the dry reinforcement either under positive pressure in the pressure chamber, or, by the action of capillary and surface forces, within the resin bath. In either case, the saturation must be completed as the tape is squeezed into the final cross-sectional form at the entrance of the heated mold where the resin will be cured to form the composite part.This paper models the resin infiltration process during pultrusion, by modifying the pre-existing simulation tool for liquid molding processes. The formulated capability can be used not only to optimize the impregnation dynamics within the pressure chamber, but can also be used to predict the required forces for the selected pulling rate. The proposed model does allow one to handle a variety of tape cross-sections, not just rectangular prisms.  aPublisher supplied data 3acomposite materials 3aliquids 3amanufacturing 3amodels 3aprisms 0aA.

The hydroalkylation proceeds with excellent anti-Markovnikov regioselectivity and provides exclusively (E)-alkenes. We have demonstrated that both alkyl- and aryl-substituted alkynes can be used as substrates, together with 1¬∞ alkyl and benzylic triflates. Finally, the transformation can be accomplished in the presence of a wide range of functional groups. Overall, the new hydroalkylation reaction allows highly efficient and diastereospecific synthesis of (E)-alkenes from readily available terminal alkynes and alkyl triflates. On the basis of a preliminary mechanistic study, we propose that the hydroalkylation reaction involves copper hydride formation, hydrocupration of an alkyne, and alkylation of an alkenyl copper intermediate.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalkylation 3aalkynes 3acopper 3ahydrides1 aSuess, Alison M.1 aLalic, Gojko0 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2015 Feb. 04, v. 137, no. 4 p.1424-1427dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fja51243683Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03155naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094024002200122024001900144040001800163100001900181245005500200300001800255500002000273506007600293520159800369592002801967506003701995650002202032650001502054650002002069650000902089650003402098650001302132650001902145650001702164650001402181650003102195650001302226650001202239650001302251650002402264650001302288700001802301700001802319700001702337700001802354700001402372700001502386773014102401856007402542852000902616655001202625IND60587430920221207133331.0180102e201707  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058743092DNAL7 a10.1111/jvim.147382doi7 aPMC55083672pmcid7 a285564542pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aUrkasemsin, G.10aGenetics of Hereditary Ataxia in Scottish Terriers  ap. 1132-1139.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Scottish Terriers have a high incidence of juvenile onset hereditary ataxia primarily affecting the Purkinje neuron of the cerebellar cortex and causing slowly progressive cerebellar dysfunction. OBJECTIVE: To identify chromosomal regions associated with hereditary ataxia in Scottish Terriers. ANIMALS: One hundred and fifty‚Äêthree Scottish Terriers were recruited through the Scottish Terrier Club of America. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Prospective study. Dogs were classified as affected if they had slowly progressive cerebellar signs. When possible, magnetic resonance imaging and histopathological evaluation of the brain were completed as diagnostic aids. To identify genomic regions connected with the disease, genome‚Äêwide mapping was performed using both linkage‚Äê and association‚Äêbased approaches. Pedigree evaluation and homozygosity mapping were also performed to examine mode of inheritance and to investigate the region of interest, respectively. RESULTS: Linkage and genome‚Äêwide association studies in a cohort of Scottish Terriers both identified a region on CFA X strongly associated with the disease trait. Homozygosity mapping revealed a 4 Mb region of interest. Pedigree evaluation failed to identify the possible mode of inheritance due to the lack of complete litter information. CONCLUSION AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: This finding suggests that further genetic investigation of the potential region of interest on CFA X should be considered in order to identify the causal mutation as well as develop a genetic test to eliminate the disease from this breed.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aataxia (disorder) 3acerebellum 3acerebral cortex 3adogs 3agenome-wide association study 3agenomics 3ahistopathology 3ahomozygosity 3ajuveniles 3amagnetic resonance imaging 3amutation 3aneurons 3apedigree 3aprospective studies 3aterriers1 aNielsen, D.M.1 aSingleton, A.1 aArepalli, S.1 aHernandez, D.1 aAgler, C.1 aOlby, N.J.0 tJournal of veterinary internal medicine.g2017 July, v. 31, no. 4 p.1132-1139dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl43440x0891-66407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jvim.147383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01585naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100006700149245017100216300001800387520042300405592002800828650001600856650001500872650001300887650001200900650002700912650001100939700001300950700002100963700006200984773012101046856008301167852000901250655001201259IND60743278820220418000000.0210707e20210623xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074327882DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.orglett.1c017332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMulamreddy, Ramakotaiah1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2189-842210a6-Hydroxymethyl Indolizidin-2-one Amino Acid Synthesis, Conformational Analysis, and Biomedical Application as Dipeptide Surrogates in Prostaglandin-F‚ÇÇŒ± Modulators  ap. 5192-5196.  a6-Hydroxymethyl indolizidin-2-one amino acids were synthesized in 10 steps from l-serine by intramolecular ring opening of a symmetrical epoxide and lactam formation.

However, the combined relationship matrix in a single-step method may need to be adjusted because marker-based and pedigree-based relationship matrices may not be on the same scale. The same may apply when a GBLUP model includes both genomic breeding values and residual polygenic effects. The objective of this study was to compare single-step blending methods and GBLUP methods with and without adjustment of the genomic relationship matrix for genomic prediction of 16 traits in the Nordic Holstein population. METHODS: The data consisted of de-regressed proofs (DRP) for 5 214 genotyped and 9 374 non-genotyped bulls. The bulls were divided into a training and a validation population by birth date, October 1, 2001. Five approaches for genomic prediction were used: 1) a simple GBLUP method, 2) a GBLUP method with a polygenic effect, 3) an adjusted GBLUP method with a polygenic effect, 4) a single-step blending method, and 5) an adjusted single-step blending method. In the adjusted GBLUP and single-step methods, the genomic relationship matrix was adjusted for the difference of scale between the genomic and the pedigree relationship matrices. A set of weights on the pedigree relationship matrix (ranging from 0.05 to 0.40) was used to build the combined relationship matrix in the single-step blending method and the GBLUP method with a polygenetic effect. RESULTS: Averaged over the 16 traits, reliabilities of genomic breeding values predicted using the GBLUP method with a polygenic effect (relative weight of 0.20) were 0.3% higher than reliabilities from the simple GBLUP method (without a polygenic effect). The adjusted single-step blending and original single-step blending methods (relative weight of 0.20) had average reliabilities that were 2.1% and 1.8% higher than the simple GBLUP method, respectively. In addition, the GBLUP method with a polygenic effect led to less bias of genomic predictions than the simple GBLUP method, and both single-step blending methods yielded less bias of predictions than all GBLUP methods. CONCLUSIONS: The single-step blending method is an appealing approach for practical genomic prediction in dairy cattle. Genomic prediction from the single-step blending method can be improved by adjusting the scale of the genomic relationship matrix.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aHolstein 3abulls 3adairy cattle 3amodels 3aparturition 3apedigree 3aprediction 2aAnimals 2aBreedingxmethods 2aCattlexgenetics 2aGenetic Variation 2aGenome 2aGenotype 2aGenotyping Techniquesxmethods 2aMale 2aMultifactorial Inheritance 2aPedigree 2aPredictive Value of Tests 2aRegression Analysis 2aReproducibility of Results1 aChristensen, Ole F1 aMadsen, Per1 aNielsen, Ulrik S1 aZhang, Yuan1 aLund, Mogens S1 aSu, Guosheng0 tGenetics, selection, evolution.g2012 Dec., v. 44, no. 1 p.2532-2532dSpringer-VerlagwJournal:jnl4350896x0999-193X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1297-9686-44-8  aDNAL 7aarticle02499naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001700153245017300170300001600343520106100359592002801420650001901448650002101467650002101488650001001509650002601519650001401545650001201559650001501571650001401586650001601600650001301616650002901629650002001658653001901678653001601697653002601713653002701739653002801766700002001794700002401814773010601838856008801944852000902032655001202041IND60597139520221118234716.0190705e201806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059713952DNAL7 a10.1016/j.marpolbul.2018.04.0622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aScott, Kevin10aUnderstanding the effects of electromagnetic field emissions from Marine Renewable Energy Devices (MREDs) on the commercially important edible crab, Cancer pagurus (L.)  ap. 580-588.  aThe effects of simulated electromagnetic fields (EMF), emitted from sub-sea power cables, on the commercially important decapod, edible crab (Cancer pagurus), were assessed. Stress related parameters were measured (l-Lactate, d-Glucose, Haemocyanin and respiration rate) along with behavioural and response parameters (antennular flicking, activity level, attraction/avoidance, shelter preference and time spent resting/roaming) during 24-h periods. Exposure to EMF had no effect on Haemocyanin concentrations, respiration rate, activity level or antennular flicking rate. EMF exposure significantly disrupted haemolymph l-Lactate and d-Glucose natural circadian rhythms. Crabs showed a clear attraction to EMF exposed shelter (69%) compared to control shelter (9%) and significantly reduced their time spent roaming by 21%. Consequently, EMF emitted from Marine Renewable Energy Devices (MREDs) will likely affect edible crabs both behaviourally and physiologically, suggesting that the impact of EMF on crustaceans must be considered when planning MREDs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCancer pagurus 3acell respiration 3acircadian rhythm 3acrabs 3aelectromagnetic field 3aemissions 3aglucose 3ahemocyanin 3ahemolymph 3alactic acid 3aplanning 3arenewable energy sources 3awater pollution 0aCancer pagurus 0aEdible crab 0aElectromagnetic field 0aEnvironmental stressor 0aMarine renewable energy1 aHarsanyi, Petra1 aLyndon, Alastair R.0 tMarine pollution bulletin.g2018 June, v. 131 p.580-588dElsevier LtdwJournal:12420x0025-326X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.marpolbul.2018.04.0623Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03756naa a2200781 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001500150245013000165300001800295520180000313592002802113650002002141650001802161650001202179650001902191650002002210650001902230650001402249650001302263650001902276650001202295650001602307650001102323650001302334650001602347650001002363650001602373650000902389650001502398650002202413650001002435650001402445653002002459653002202479653002002501653001302521653001402534653000802548653000802556653001002564653000702574653000902581653001102590653000902601653001002610653001002620653000802630653000702638653000802645653000802653653000802661653000902669653001302678653000702691653001002698653000802708700001502716700001702731700001302748773010702761856008502868852000902953655001202962IND60557298320221123022918.0180831e20161215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055729832DNAL7 a10.1016/j.phymed.2016.10.0172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Nan14aThe anxiolytic effect of essential oil of Cananga odorata exposure on mice and determination of its major active constituents  ap. 1727-1734.  aEssential oil from Cananga odorata (ylang-ylang essential oil, YYO) is usually used in reducing blood pressure, improving cognitive functioning in aromatherapy in human. Few reports showed its effect on anxiety behaviors.To investigate the anxiolytic effects of YYO exposure on anxiety animal models, determine the major active constituents and investigate the change of neurotransmitters after odor exposure.ICR mice were subjected to three anxiety models including open field, elevated plus maze and light-dark box tests after acute and chronic YYO exposure. Main constituents of YYO were defined using GC/MS. These compounds were then tested on the male mice separately on three anxiety models. The monoamines neurotransmitters and their metabolites were analyzed after acute odor exposure and elevated plus maze test.YYO exposure only showed significant anxiolytic effect on the male mice. It increased the time that mice visited open arms and light box area in elevated plus maze and light-dark box tests after acute and chronic YYO exposures. Three main constituents of YYO, benzyl benzoate, linalool and benzyl alcohol showed anxiolytic effect on the male mice individually. YYO exposure brought changes of neurotransmitters on the male mice more significantly than the female mice. It decreased the dopamine (DA) concentration in the striatum and increased the 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) concentration in the hippocampus of the male mice. The major constituent benzyl benzoate changed neurotransmitters concentration in accordance with the YYO. Moreover, it decreased the ratio of 5-HIAA/5-HT in the hippocampus.Both acute and chronic YYO exposure showed anxiolytic effect on the male mice. YYO and its major constituent benzyl benzoate might act on the 5-HTnergic and DAnergic pathways.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCananga odorata 3aanimal models 3aanxiety 3abenzyl alcohol 3abenzyl benzoate 3ablood pressure 3acognition 3adopamine 3aessential oils 3afemales 3ahippocampus 3ahumans 3alinalool 3amale effect 3amales 3ametabolites 3amice 3amonoamines 3aneurotransmitters 3aodors 3aserotonin 0aCananga odorata 0aAnxiolytic effect 0aBenzyl benzoate 0aDopamine 0aSerotonin 0aYYO 0aICR 0aGC/MS 0aDA 0a5-HT 0a5-HIAA 0aGABA 0aSSRIs 0aMAOIs 0aDZP 0aOF 0aEPM 0aLDB 0aPFC 0aDHBA 0aEDTA-2Na 0aNE 0aDOPAC 0aHVA1 aZhang, Lei1 aFeng, Linyin1 aYao, Lei0 tPhytomedicine.g2016 Dec. 15, v. 23, no. 14 p.1727-1734dElsevier GmbHwJournal:12402x0944-71137nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.phymed.2016.10.0173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03750naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002200145245011000167300001800277520182100295592002802116596001402144596006902158596008002227596002802307650002502335650002002360650002302380650001302403650001202416650002202428650001302450650001302463650001402476650002702490650001302517650002802530650003002558650001302588650002002601650001202621650001002633653001202643653002002655653001702675653001002692700002902702700001902731700001802750700002702768700002302795700003402818700002302852700002802875773012002903856007903023961001303102852000903115655001203124IND60674346720221118115119.0191025e20180530xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067434672DNAL7 a10.1093/treephys/tpy0492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKnipfer, Thorsten10aVariations in xylem embolism susceptibility under drought between intact saplings of three walnut species  ap. 1180-1192.  aA germplasm collection containing varied Juglans genotypes holds potential to improve drought resistance of plant materials for commercial production. We used X-ray computed microtomography to evaluate stem xylem embolism susceptibility/repair in relation to vessel anatomical features (size, arrangement, connectivity and pit characteristics) in 2-year-old saplings of three Juglans species. In vivo analysis revealed interspecific variations in embolism susceptibility among Juglans microcarpa, J. hindsii (both native to arid habitats) and J. ailantifolia (native to mesic habitats). Stem xylem of J. microcarpa was more resistant to drought-induced embolism as compared with J. hindsii and J. ailantifolia (differences in embolism susceptibility among older and current year xylem were not detected in any species). Variations in most vessel anatomical traits were negligible among the three species; however, we detected substantial interspecific differences in intervessel pit characteristics. As compared with J. hindsii and J. ailantifolia, low embolism susceptibility in J. microcarpa was associated with smaller pit size in larger diameter vessels, a smaller area of the shared vessel wall occupied by pits, lower pit frequency and no changes in pit characteristics as vessel diameters increased. Changes in amount of embolized vessels following 40 days of re-watering were minor in intact saplings of all three species highlighting that an embolism repair mechanism did not contribute to drought recovery. In conclusion, our data indicate that interspecific variations in drought-induced embolism susceptibility are associated with species-specific pit characteristics, and these traits may provide a future target for breeding efforts aimed at selecting walnut germplasm with improved drought resistance.  aPublisher supplied data  cNIFA SCRI  cAmerican Vineyard Foundationdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100008878  a2032-21220-006-00cUSDA-ARS Sustainable Viticulture Production Systems CRIS  cKatherine Esau Graduate 3aJuglans ailantifolia 3aJuglans hindsii 3aJuglans microcarpa 3abreeding 3adrought 3adrought tolerance 3aembolism 3agenotype 3agermplasm 3agermplasm conservation 3ahabitats 3ainterspecific variation 3amicro-computed tomography 3asaplings 3atree physiology 3awalnuts 3axylem 0amicroCT 0awater relations 0awater stress 0aX-ray1 aBarrios-Masias, Felipe H1 aCuneo, Italo F1 aBouda, Martin1 aAlbuquerque, Caetano P1 aBrodersen, Craig R1 aKluepfel, D.

In the present study we assess the action of SR-B1 initiated PI3K‚ÄìAkt‚ÄìeNOS signaling in the regulation of COX-2 expression and PGI‚ÇÇ production in response to HDL. We found that apoA1 could increase PGI‚ÇÇ release and COX-2 expression in ECV 304 endothelial cells. Furthermore, SR-B1 was found to be involved in HDL induced up-regulation of COX-2 and PGI‚ÇÇ. Over-expressed SR-B1 did not significantly increase the expression of COX-2 and the PGI‚ÇÇ levels, but knock-down of SR-B1 by siRNA could significantly attenuate COX-2 expression and PGI‚ÇÇ release together with p38MAPK and CREB phosphorylation. Consistently, the declines of p-p38MAPK, p-CREB, COX-2 and PGI‚ÇÇ were also observed after incubation with LY294002 (25Œºmol/L; PI3K special inhibitor) or L-NAME (50Œºmol/L; eNOS special inhibitor). In addition, we demonstrated the increases of PGI‚ÇÇ release, COX-2 expression and p38MAPK phosphorylation, when nitric oxide level was raised through the incubation of L-arginine (10 or 20nmol/L) in endothelial cells. Taking together, our data support that SR-B1 mediated PI3K‚ÄìAkt‚ÄìeNOS signaling was involved in HDL-induced COX-2 expression and PGI‚ÇÇ release in endothelial cells.  aPublisher supplied data 3aendothelial cells 3aendothelial nitric oxide synthase 3agene overexpression 3ahigh density lipoprotein 3anitric oxide 3aphosphatidylinositol 3-kinase 3aphospholipids 3aphosphorylation 3aprostacyclin 3aprostaglandin synthase 3areceptors 3asmall interfering RNA1 aZu, Xu-Yu1 aCao, Ren-Xian1 aLiu, Jiang-Hua1 aMo, Zhong-Cheng1 aZeng, Ying1 aLi, Yuan-Bin1 aXiong, Sheng-Lin1 aLiu, Xing1 aLiao, Duan-Fang1 aYi, Guang-Hui0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2012 Mar. 30, v. 420, no. 1 p.17-23dElsevier Inc.x0006-291X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2012.02.1033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02866naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001400139245017800153300001600331500002000347520152300367592002801890596004601918596002901964650001101993650001102004650002102015650001902036650001002055650001702065650001202082650001802094651001402112700005802126700001102184700005302195773013702248856007402385852000902459655001202468IND60787676320221118042424.0220810e202208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078767632DNAL7 a10.1111/avj.131692doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Y.,10aRelative perceptions of prevalence, impact and importance of photosensitisation in Australian livestock: A survey of veterinarians, livestock traders and livestock producers  ap. 388-396.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aAIMS: To investigate the relative differences in the perceptions and awareness of outbreaks of photosensitisation in Australian livestock stakeholders, including veterinarians, livestock traders and producers. METHODS: A questionnaire was developed and circulated to livestock veterinarians, producers and traders in Australia via email addresses obtained from public access sources. The questionnaire was designed to evaluate participants' awareness and perception of health, welfare, and production issues associated with outbreaks of photosensitisation and towards the incidence and importance of photosensitisation in livestock. RESULTS: One hundred and twenty‚Äêeight online responses were received in total. Nearly half of the respondents (49.0%) indicated they would encounter 1‚Äì3 outbreaks annually. The majority of veterinarian and livestock producers stated that outbreaks of photosensitisation were common and economically important, with cattle and sheep being equally considered as susceptible species to this condition, and secondary (hepatogeneous) photosensitisation is the most common type. CONCLUSION: This survey confirms the anecdotal evidence that photosensitisation in livestock in Australia is commonly encountered by veterinarians and livestock producers. However, there is no industry‚Äêwide common acceptance of the issue, broader opinions should be canvassed when considering impacts on stakeholders regarding photosensitisation outbreaks in livestock in Australia or abroad in the future.  aPublisher supplied data  cGraham Centre for Agricultural Innovation  cCharles Sturt University 3acattle 3ae-mail 3aphotosensitivity 3aquestionnaires 3asheep 3astakeholders 3asurveys 3aveterinarians 3aAustralia1 aLoukopoulos, P1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4308-86181 aXie, G1 aQuinn, JC1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9310-02910 tAustralian veterinary journal.g2022 Aug., v. 100, no. 8 p.388-396dWiley Publishing Asia Pty LtdwJournal:jnl45498x0005-04237nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/avj.131693Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03161naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002000153245013400173300001400307520194200321592002802263650001002291650003102301650001302332650001702345650000902362650002002371653004202391653002002433653002302453653002802476653003102504700002202535700002702557773010702584856008702691852000902778655001202787IND60571020520221119115552.0190402e201709  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057102052DNAL7 a10.1016/j.advwatres.2017.06.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSweijen, Thomas10aCapillary pressure‚Äìsaturation relationships for porous granular materials: Pore morphology method vs. pore unit assembly method  ap. 22-31.  aIn studies of two-phase flow in complex porous media it is often desirable to have an estimation of the capillary pressure‚Äìsaturation curve prior to measurements. Therefore, we compare in this research the capability of three pore-scale approaches in reproducing experimentally measured capillary pressure‚Äìsaturation curves. To do so, we have generated 12 packings of spheres that are representative of four different glass-bead packings and eight different sand packings, for which we have found experimental data on the capillary pressure‚Äìsaturation curve in the literature. In generating the packings, we matched the particle size distributions and porosity values of the granular materials. We have used three different pore-scale approaches for generating the capillary pressure‚Äìsaturation curves of each packing: i) the Pore Unit Assembly (PUA) method in combination with the Mayer and Stowe‚ÄìPrincen (MS‚ÄìP) approximation for estimating the entry pressures of pore throats, ii) the PUA method in combination with the hemisphere approximation, and iii) the Pore Morphology Method (PMM) in combination with the hemisphere approximation. The three approaches were also used to produce capillary pressure‚Äìsaturation curves for the coating layer of paper, used in inkjet printing. Curves for such layers are extremely difficult to determine experimentally, due to their very small thickness and the presence of extremely small pores (less than one micrometer in size). Results indicate that the PMM and PUA-hemisphere method give similar capillary pressure‚Äìsaturation curves, because both methods rely on a hemisphere to represent the air‚Äìwater interface. The ability of the hemisphere approximation and the MS‚ÄìP approximation to reproduce correct capillary pressure seems to depend on the type of particle size distribution, with the hemisphere approximation working well for narrowly distributed granular materials.  aPublisher supplied data 3apaper 3aparticle size distribution 3aporosity 3aporous media 3asand 3awater resources 0aCapillary pressure‚Äìsaturation curve 0aPore morphology 0aPore unit assembly 0aDiscrete element method 0aParticle size distribution1 aAslannejad, Hamed1 aHassanizadeh, S.

In this study, three phases composites consisting of poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF), Al nanoparticles and Œ≤-silicon carbide whiskers (Œ≤-SiCw) were prepared. The thermal conductivity, morphological and dielectric properties of the composites were investigated. The results indicate that the addition of 12vol% Œ≤-SiCw not only improves the thermal conductivity of Al/PVDF from 1.57 to 2.1W/mK, but also remarkably increases the dielectric constant from 46 to 330 at 100Hz, whereas the dielectric loss of the composites still remain at relatively low levels similar to that of Al/PVDF at a wider frequency range from 10‚Åª¬πHz to 10‚Å∑Hz. With further increasing the Œ≤-SiCw loading to 20vol%, the thermal conductivity and dielectric constant of the composites continue to increase, whereas both the dielectric loss and conductivity also rise rapidly.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaluminum 3acomposite polymers 3adielectric properties 3aindustry 3ananoparticles 3athermal conductivity 3athermoplastics 0aA.

Cell concentration is a fundamental parameter in any cultivation but is typically measured using off-line methods that may be time-consuming, laborious, or subject to interferences. Here, an in-situ microscope has been adapted for monitoring microalgal cultivations by adding a flow-through cell and adjusting image-processing algorithms. After installation in the bypass of a photobioreactor, the microscope enabled the continuous, automated acquisition of cell count, cell size, and cell morphology data on-line during cultivation processes over a period of 20days, without sampling. The flow-through microscope was tested in cultivations of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii and Chlorella vulgaris. Cell concentration measurements were in agreement with off-line optical density measurements for both species. In addition, cell size and morphology distributions were obtained that revealed population shifts during the cultivation of C. vulgaris. This monitoring system thus provides a means to obtain detailed, non-invasive insights of microalgal cultivation processes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChlamydomonas reinhardtii 3aChlorella vulgaris 3aabsorbance 3aalgorithms 3acell biology 3amicroalgae 3amicroscopy 3amonitoring 3aphotobioreactors 3aprocess control 0aFlow-through microscopy 0aMicroalgae 0aAutomated image processing 0aCell count 0aCell size distribution1 aReardon, Kenneth F.1 a√únal, Mehmet,1 aLindner, Patrick1 aPrediger, Andreas1 aBabitzky, Alexander1 aBeutel, Sascha1 aScheper, Thomas0 tAlgal research.g2013 July, v. 2, no. 3 p.253-257dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12360x2211-92647nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.algal.2013.04.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02941naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002000153245015900173500002200332520179400354592002802148650001502176650002602191650001402217650002702231650001502258650001002273653002102283653002602304653001202330653000702342653002702349653002602376773008102402856008702483852000902570655001202579IND60584446320221118183855.0171025s2017    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058444632DNAL7 a10.1016/j.resconrec.2017.10.0192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPauliuk, Stefan10aCritical appraisal of the circular economy standard BS 8001:2017 and a dashboard of quantitative system indicators for its implementation in organizations  aPre-press version  aSo far, organizations had no authoritative guidance on circular economy (CE) principles, strategies, implementation, and monitoring. Consequentially, the British Standards Institution recently launched a new standard ‚ÄúBS 8001:2017 ‚Äì Framework for implementing the principles of the circular economy in organizations‚Äù.BS 8001:2017 tries to reconcile the far-reaching ambitions of the CE with established business routines. The standard contains a comprehensive list of CE terms and definitions, a set of general CE principles, a flexible management framework for implementing CE strategies in organizations, and a detailed description of economic, environmental, design, marketing, and legal issues related to the CE.The guidance on monitoring CE strategy implementation, however, remains vague. The standard stipulates that organizations are solely responsible for choosing appropriate CE indicators. Its authors do not elaborate on the links between CE strategy monitoring and the relevant and already standardized quantitative tools life cycle assessment (LCA) and material flow cost accounting (MFCA).Here a general system definition for deriving CE indicators is proposed. Based on the system definition and the indicator literature a dashboard of new and established quantitative indicators for CE strategy assessment in organizations is then compiled. The dashboard indicators are mostly based on material flow analysis (MFA), MFCA, and LCA. Steel cycle data are used to illustrate potential core CE indicators, notably, the residence time of a material in the techno-sphere (currently 250‚Äì300 years for steel). Moreover, organizations need to monitor their contribution to in-use-stock growth, a central driver of resource depletion and hindrance to closing material cycles.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaccounting 3alife cycle assessment 3amarketing 3amaterial flow analysis 3amonitoring 3asteel 0aCircular economy 0aCircularity indicator 0aBS 8001 0a3R 0aMaterial flow analysis 0aLife cycle assessment0 tResources, Conservation & Recycling.g2017, dElsevier B.V.x0921-34497nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.resconrec.2017.10.0193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01321naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245011600159300002000275520028000295592002800575650002300603650000900626650001200635650001400647650002800661700002100689700001900710700002400729700002200753773013600775856007500911852000900986655001200995IND60659102020221120070343.0190827e20111018xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065910202DNAL7 a10.1039/c1cc14758g2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYee, Gereon M.10aSimple routes to bulky silyl-substituted acetylide ligands and examples of V(iii), Fe(ii), and Mn(ii) complexes  ap. 11680-11682.  aSynthesis of substituted phenylacetylide ligands 2,6-bis(trimethylsilyl)phenylacetylene (H1) and 2-(triphenylsilyl)phenylacteylene (H2) is reported.

Signal acquisition results from the heterogeneous immune reactions and reactant transport. Antibody immobilization is the most important part of heterogeneous immune reactions, and reactant transport is reflected in the form of fluid velocity. Here, we reported several surface modification processes on polystyrene substrates that are employed to study the relationship between the antibody immobilization and flow behavior in heterogeneous immune response processes. The antibody was immobilized using covalent grafting. Based on the mechanism of sandwich enzyme linked immunosorbent assay, a fluorescence quantitative detection method was used to evaluate the immune response process. The effects of different surface modification processes on immune response and flow behavior were studied. We identified an optimal flow velocity in the dynamic immune response system in the microfluidic chip. The immune response signal was the strongest when the average flow velocity was approximately 0.2‚Äâmm/s in the procalcitonin detection system. Compared with the amino and aldehyde group substrates, the epoxy group substrate has the highest antibody immobilization efficiency; compared with the surface modified by small molecular groups, the introduction of Poly-L-Lysine can increase the amount of antibody immobilization.  aThis work is financially supported by ‚ÄúNational Natural Science Foundation of China [Grant No. 51775302],‚Äù ‚ÄúError!

A 2-year field experiment was conducted to investigate phytoremediation efficiency using the hyperaccumulator Pteris vittata on an arsenic (As)-contaminated site. The remediation efficiency was evaluated through the removal rate of As in soils and extraction rate of heavy metals in plants. After 2¬†years of remediation, the concentration of total As in soils decreased from 16.27¬†mg¬†kg‚Åª¬π in 2012 to 14.58¬†mg¬†kg‚Åª¬π in 2014. The total remediation efficiency of As was 10.39% in terms of the removal rate of heavy metals calculated for soils, whereas the remediation efficiency calculated from As uptake by P. vittata was 16.09%. Such a discrepancy aroused further consideration on the potential input of As. A large amount of As was brought in by atmospheric emissions, which possibly biased the calculation of remediation efficiency. In fact, considering also the atmospheric depositions of As, the corrected removal rate of As from soil was 16.57%. Therefore, the results of this work suggest that (i) when evaluating the phytoextraction efficiency, the whole input and output cycle of the element of interest in the targeted ecosystem must be considered, and (ii) P. vittata has the potential to be used to remediate As-contaminated soils in Henan Province, China.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPteris vittata 3aarsenic 3aatmospheric deposition 3aecosystems 3aemissions 3afield experimentation 3aheavy metals 3ahyperaccumulators 3aphytoremediation 3asoil 3aChina1 aWan, Xiaoming1 aGuo, Guanghui1 aYang, Junxing1 aChen, Tongbin0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research international.g2018 Jan., v. 25, no. 1 p.124-131dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-016-8184-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02475naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245008700167300001600254520127300270592002801543650001201571650001701583650002301600650002601623650001301649650002001662650001001682650001601692650001201708650002101720651001101741653002301752653002001775653003101795653001301826653001301839700001601852773009201868856008401960852000902044655001202053IND60566826020221117160356.0170709s2017    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056682602DNAL7 a10.1016/j.proenv.2017.03.1652doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMavridou, S.10aEnvironmental Noise Performance of Rubberized Asphalt Mixtures: Lamia's case study  ap. 804-811.  aTraffic noise is one of the most serious concerns to issues related to environmental quality in many urban communities throughout the world.

This research follows the European Project with the acronym ROADTIRE, co-funded by the European Commission, and it has been funded by General Secretariat of Research and Technology (GGET).Results certify that rubberized asphalt layers provide a safe, cost effective road surface and environmentally friendly option of pavement.Rubberized bituminous mixtures could be agood solution for the re-surfacing of any street which is in poor condition, since not only does it reduce noisegeneration, but it also provides more durable pavements that are less susceptible to the effects of temperature.  aPublisher supplied data 3abitumen 3acase studies 3acost effectiveness 3aenvironmental quality 3ageometry 3anoise pollution 3aroads 3atemperature 3atraffic 3aurban population 3aGreece 0aRubberized asphalt 0anoise pollution 0aenvironmental measurements 0apavement 0atraffic.1 aKehagia, F.0 tProcedia Environmental Sciences.g2017, v. 38 p.804-811dElsevier B.V.x1878-02967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.proenv.2017.03.1653Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02393naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002500139245010900164300001800273520125600291592002801547650001401575650002301589650002301612650002101635650002401656650002001680700001901700700003201719700002301751700002701774700002701801773013101828856007501959852000902034655001202043IND60541637120221120023111.0160822e20150204xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054163712DNAL7 a10.1021/ja512573q2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHalskov, Kim S√∏holm10aOrganocatalytic Enamine-Activation of Cyclopropanes for Highly Stereoselective Formation of Cyclobutanes  ap. 1685-1691.  aA novel organocatalytic activation mode of cyclopropanes is presented. The reaction concept is based on a design in which a reactive donor‚Äìacceptor cyclopropane intermediate is generated by in situ condensation of cyclopropylacetaldehydes with an aminocatalyst. The mechanism of this enamine-based activation of cyclopropylacetaldehydes is investigated by the application of a combined computational and experimental approach. The activation can be traced to a favorable orbital interaction between the œÄ‚Äìorbital of the enamine and the œÉ*C‚ÄìC orbital of the cyclopropyl ring. Furthermore, the synthetic potential of the developed system has been evaluated. By the application of a chiral secondary amine catalyst, the organocatalytically activated cyclopropanes show an unexpected and highly stereoselective formation of cyclobutanes, functionalizing at the usually inert sites of the donor‚Äìacceptor cyclopropane. By the application of 3-olefinic oxindoles and benzofuranone, biologically relevant spirocyclobutaneoxindoles and spirocyclobutanebenzofuranone can be obtained in good yields, high diastereomeric ratios, and excellent enantiomeric excesses. The mechanism of the reaction is discussed and two mechanistic proposals are presented.  aPublisher supplied data 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3achemical reactions 3amolecular models 3areaction mechanisms 3astereochemistry1 aKniep, Florian1 aLauridsen, Vibeke Henriette1 aIversen, Eva H√∏gh1 aDonslund, Bjarke Skyum1 aJ√∏rgensen, Karl Anker0 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2015 Feb. 04, v. 137, no. 4 p.1685-1691dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fja512573q3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03467naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094024002200122024001900144040001800163100001900181245008300200300001800283500002000301506007600321520190800397592002802305506003702333650001102370650000902381650001002390650002802400650001402428650002002442650001202462650001502474650001402489650001702503650002402520650001702544650001902561650002102580650001302601651001902614700001602633700001602649700001702665700001602682700001502698773014102713856007402854852000902928655001202937IND60587431320221207132324.0180102e201707  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058743132DNAL7 a10.1111/jvim.147372doi7 aPMC55083462pmcid7 a286123802pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCrossley, V.J.10aBreed, Coat Color, and Hair Length as Risk Factors for Hyperthyroidism in Cats  ap. 1028-1034.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Hyperthyroidism is very common in older cats, but the etiopathogenesis is poorly understood. Decreased risk of hyperthyroidism has been reported in certain colorpoint breeds, and this observation previously has been hypothesized to result from relatively greater tyrosine availability for thyroid hormone production because of limited ability to convert tyrosine to melanin pigment. However, studies investigating a potential link between coat pigmentation and risk of hyperthyroidism are limited. OBJECTIVE: To identify associations between coat phenotype and hyperthyroidism by investigation of breed, coat color, and hair length as risk factors for the disease. ANIMALS: Data were used from 4,705 cats aged ‚â•10 years, referred to a single veterinary teaching hospital (2006‚Äì2014) in the United Kingdom. METHODS: Retrospective, epidemiological, cross‚Äêsectional study using Bayesian multivariable logistic regression to assess risk factors for hyperthyroidism. RESULTS: Burmese (odds ratio [OR], 0.01; 0.00‚Äì0.23; P = .004), Tonkinese (OR, 0.05; 0.00‚Äì0.95; P = .046), Persian (OR, 0.21; 0.10‚Äì0.44; P < .001), Siamese (OR, 0.27; 0.12‚Äì0.61; P = .002), Abyssinian (OR, 0.04; 0.00‚Äì0.74; P = .031), and British shorthair (OR, 0.47; 0.28‚Äì0.79; P = .004) breeds had decreased risk of hyperthyroidism compared to domestic shorthairs. Longhaired, nonpurebred cats (OR, 1.30; 1.03‚Äì1.64; P = .028) were at increased risk of hyperthyroidism. Coat color/pattern was not associated with hyperthyroidism in nonpurebred cats. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: We identified decreased risk of hyperthyroidism in the Tonkinese, Abyssinian, and British shorthair breeds, identified an association between risk of hyperthyroidism and hair length, and confirmed decreased risk in Burmese, Siamese, and Persian breeds. Additional studies are warranted to further investigate these findings.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abreeds 3acats 3acolor 3across-sectional studies 3ahospitals 3ahyperthyroidism 3amelanin 3aodds ratio 3aphenotype 3apigmentation 3aregression analysis 3arisk factors 3arisk reduction 3athyroid hormones 3atyrosine 3aUnited Kingdom1 aDebnath, A.1 aChang, Y.M.1 aFowkes, R.C.1 aElliott, J.1 aSyme, H.M.0 tJournal of veterinary internal medicine.g2017 July, v. 31, no. 4 p.1028-1034dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl43440x0891-66407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jvim.147373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02006naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245011800172300001600290520082500306592002801131650001101159650002001170650002201190650002801212650001801240650002501258650001601283653003001299653002301329653002001352653002901372700002401401700002201425773009201447856008401539852000901623655001201632IND60566826120221117172932.0170709s2017    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056682612DNAL7 a10.1016/j.proenv.2017.03.1662doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIllampas, Rogiros10aComputational Evaluation of the Thermal, Environmental and Structural Performance of an Innovative Masonry System  ap. 812-820.  aThis study examines - by means of numerical analysis - the thermal, environmental and structural performance of an innovative modular masonry system that is currently under development.

Coupled to thermal conversion via slow pyrolysis, the prospect of biologically ‚Äòsequestering‚Äô carbon derived from microalgae biomass as biochar, added to soil, is considered. However, an intensive closed culturing photobioreactor system coupled to a pyrolysis process incurs a net increase in global warming and overall life cycle impact, notwithstanding biochar application to soil. Results indicate that up to 50% of environmental impact in certain categories stems from the upstream influence of fertiliser production. Energy used in flue gas delivery and pumping during cultivation is also considerable, suggesting that current practice in closed cultivation systems does not yet adequately trade-off biomass productivity against operating intensity. Drying of the harvested microalgae biomass for pyrolysis processing is potentially a major hurdle in terms of process viability also. Overall, utilisation of nutrients derived from waste streams, integrating renewable energy and capture of process heat for more efficient drying are essential levers for reducing the environmental impact of this proposition.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgae culture 3abiochar 3abiofuels 3abiomass production 3acarbon 3adrying 3aenergy 3aenvironmental impact 3aflue gas 3aglobal warming 3alife cycle assessment 3amicroalgae 3anutrients 3aphotobioreactors 3apyrolysis 3asoil 3asoil treatment 3aviability 0aMicroalgae 0aLife cycle assessment 0aPyrolysis 0aBio-CCS1 aStrezov, Vladimir1 aBengtsson, J.q(Jonas),0 tAlgal research.g2013 July, v. 2, no. 3 p.299-311dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12360x2211-92647nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.algal.2013.04.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03005naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245009400166300001600260500001500276520161400291592002801905650003501933650003101968650001201999650002802011650001602039650002002055650001702075650002702092650000902119650002202128650001402150653001702164700002602181700001802207700002002225700002002245700002302265700002002288700002002308773012802328856008202456852000902538655001202547IND60089550220221121074825.0141102e20120330xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008955022DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbrc.2012.02.1222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKawano, Ayumi10aRegulation of P2X7-dependent inflammatory functions by P2X4 receptor in mouse macrophages  ap. 102-107.  a2019-12-06  aActivation of the P2X7 receptor of macrophages plays an important role in inflammation. We recently reported that co-expression of P2X4 receptor with P2X7 receptor facilitates P2X7 receptor-mediated cell death via Ca¬≤‚Å∫ influx. However, it remained unclear whether P2X4 receptor is involved in P2X7 receptor-mediated inflammatory responses, such as cytokine production. Here, we present evidence that P2X4 receptor modulates P2X7 receptor-dependent inflammatory functions. Treatment of mouse macrophage RAW264.7 cells with 1mM ATP induced high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) release and IL-1Œ≤ production via activation of P2X7 receptor. Knockdown of P2X4 receptor or removal of extracellular Ca¬≤‚Å∫ suppressed ATP-induced release of both HMGB1 and IL-1Œ≤. On the other hand, knockdown of P2X4 receptor or removal of extracellular Ca¬≤‚Å∫ enhanced P2X7-dependent LC3-II expression (an index of autophagy), suggesting that P2X4 receptor suppresses P2X7-mediated autophagy. Since LC3-II expression was inhibited by pretreatment with antioxidant and NADPH oxidase inhibitor, we examined P2X7-mediated production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). We found that activation of P2X7 receptor-mediated production of ROS was significantly facilitated in P2X4-knockdown cells, suggesting that co-expression of P2X4 receptor with P2X7 receptor may suppress anti-inflammatory function-related autophagy via suppression of ROS production. We conclude that co-expression of P2X4 receptor with P2X7 receptor enhances P2X7-mediated inflammation through both facilitation of release of cytokines and suppression of autophagy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNAD(P)H oxidase (H2O2-forming) 3aanti-inflammatory activity 3acalcium 3areactive oxygen species 3amacrophages 3aNADP (coenzyme) 3ainflammation 3aadenosine triphosphate 3amice 3ainterleukin-1beta 3aautophagy 0aantioxidants1 aTsukimoto, Mitsutoshi1 aMori, Daisuke1 aNoguchi, Taisei1 aHarada, Hitoshi1 aTakenouchi, Takato1 aKitani, Hiroshi1 aKojima, Sh≈´ji,0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2012 Mar. 30, v. 420, no. 1 p.102-107dElsevier Inc.x0006-291X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2012.02.1223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03698naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001700094024002100111024003700132024001100169040001800180100002400198245011900222300001400341506017300355520186300528650002002391650001802411650001002429650001702439650002002456650001402476650001102490650001302501650001502514650002302529650002202552650001902574650001202593650001502605650002202620650001502642651001302657651002402670700002202694700002002716773007702736856011202813856008302925956014203008961000903150852000903159655001203168IND60005971320221214224724.0141022s2014    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6000597132DNAL7 a3019432aris7 a10113/597132hdl7 a10.4996/fireecology.10020362doi8 ans5552  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAugustine, David J.10aCharacteristics of burns conducted under modified prescriptions to mitigate limited fuels in a semi-arid grassland  ap. 36-47.  aWorks produced by employees of the U.S. Government as part of their official duties are not copyrighted within the U.S. The content of this document is not copyrighted.  aIn semiarid grasslands of the North American Great Plains, fire has traditionally been viewed as having few management applications, and quantitative measurements of fire behavior in the low fuel loads characteristic of this region are lacking. More recently, land managers have recognized potential applications of prescribed fire to control undesirable plant species and to manage habitat for wildlife in this region. Working in the shortgrass steppe of northeastern Colorado over a 7-year period, we quantified peak temperatures, heating duration, and heat dosage produced near ground level during prescribed burns conducted under a wide range of fuel loads and weather conditions. We use an information theoretic approach to develop models that predict peak temperature and heat dosage as a function of weather parameters and fuel loads. We conducted successful burns (>80% of target area burnt) with fuel loads varying from 350 ‚Äì 1175 kg ha-1, while burns with fuel loads <350 kg ha-1 generally failed to spread and burned less than 60% of target areas. Peak temperatures, heat duration and heat dosage during shortgrass burns were 1) lower than reported for mixed-grass prairies, 2) primarily influenced by variation in fuel loads, and 3) secondarily influenced by wind speed, ambient air temperature, and relative humidity. Compared to desert grassland, heat doses near the ground surface were similar, but peak temperatures were lower and heat duration longer in shortgrass steppe burns.Our findings provide quantitative predictions for heat production from fires in shortgrass steppe near the ground surface, where most plant meristems are located. Based on these relationships, we provide suggestions for burn prescriptions to achieve goals such as reducing abundance of undesirable plant species and providing habitat for native grassland birds. 3aair temperature 3afire behavior 3afires 3afuel loading 3aheat production 3ameristems 3amodels 3aprairies 3aprediction 3aprescribed burning 3arelative humidity 3asemiarid zones 3asteppes 3awild birds 3awildlife habitats 3awind speed 3aColorado 3aGreat Plains region1 aDerner, Justin D.1 aSmith, David P.0 tFire ecology.g2014, v. 10, no. 2 p.36-47wJournal:6171x1933-97477nnas40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/597133Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.4996/fireecology.10020363Available from publisher's site  aARIS submissionbhttp://submit-u.nal.usda.gov/system/files/submissions/Augustine%20etal_2014_Rx%20characteristics%20in%20shortgrass_0.pdf  aUSDA  aDNAL 7aarticle02428naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100006100153245009500214300001600309520106800325592002801393650001301421650001101434650002001445650001201465650001101477650001701488650002201505650000901527650002301536650001201559650001801571650001501589650001401604650001101618650002001629650000901649653001201658653001601670653001801686653001301704653001501717653001101732773010601743856008801849852000901937655001201946IND60597140020221118231928.0190705e201806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059714002DNAL7 a10.1016/j.marpolbul.2018.04.0682doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMandich, McKenzie1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7550-330210aRanked effects of heavy metals on marine bivalves in laboratory mesocosms: A meta-analysis  ap. 773-781.  aBivalves are commonly used as biomonitors for heavy metal pollution in marine environments because they accumulate heavy metal ions quickly, are sessile, abundant, and widely dispersed, and adult mortality from contamination is rare. However, the breadth of experiments used to measure the effect of heavy metal contamination can obscure general trends. It is unclear which heavy metals cause the most severe effects, how severity varies with exposure concentration and duration, and whether effects vary with level of biological organization. I conducted a meta-analysis of 48 mesocosm studies on the effects of heavy metal ions ‚Äì silver, cadmium, copper, mercury, lead, and zinc ‚Äì on marine bivalves. The ordering of effect sizes was Pb‚ÄØ>‚ÄØHg‚ÄØ>‚ÄØCu‚ÄØ>‚ÄØZn‚ÄØ>‚ÄØCd‚ÄØ>‚ÄØAg. The significance and direction of concentration and duration as moderators depended on the metal and the biological level. Future studies should consider non-linear effects over time and concentration, and measure both bioaccumulation and effect of the metals being studies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBivalvia 3aadults 3abioaccumulation 3acadmium 3acopper 3aheavy metals 3aindicator species 3alead 3amarine environment 3amercury 3ameta-analysis 3ametal ions 3amortality 3asilver 3awater pollution 3azinc 0aBivalve 0aHeavy metal 0aMeta-analysis 0aMesocosm 0aBiomonitor 0aMarine0 tMarine pollution bulletin.g2018 June, v. 131 p.773-781dElsevier LtdwJournal:12420x0025-326X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.marpolbul.2018.04.0683Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02927naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002400150245010900174300001600283520174100299592002802040650001902068650001302087650001302100650002402113650002202137650002502159650002502184650001202209650001702221651001102238653002202249653001402271653001802285653001502303700002602318773009202344856008402436852000902520655001202529IND60566826320221117160340.0170709s2017    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056682632DNAL7 a10.1016/j.proenv.2017.03.1682doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChadiarakou, Stella10aApplication of Innovative Composite Cool Thermal Insulating Material for the Energy Upgrade of Buildings  ap. 830-835.  aThe need to improve energy efficiency of existing buildings is more than understandable and compelling. It is expressed through the EU Directive 2002/91/EU concerning the energy performance of buildings, the Greek Law 3661/08 concerning the improvement of the energy performance of buildings; which constitutes the harmonization of the Directive in the Greek legislation as well as the Regulation on Energy Efficiency Buildings (KENAK) which together with the Technical Instructions of the Technical Chamber of Greece, are the main application of the Legislation.The composite cool materials are a new and interesting solution for the constructions. Having identified -with extensive bibliographic research- the existing state of the market for thermal insulation materials and trends, these composite materials were characterized as a successful option. Finally, external thermal insulation composite systems were produced (with photocatalytic coating) and composite materials for the roof (extruded polystyrene with low reflectivity ceramic tile) which were analyzed -initially theoretically- in order to determine the energy performance of the building before and after their application, and then applied to an existing building.Additionally, there were determined the conditions before and after the installation of materials for thermal insulation capacity, by measuring the rate of heat transfer, by conducting measurements for the evaluation of the implementation of the new products of thermal comfort and air quality as well as by representative measurements of the microclimate of the area both during summer and winter. The results of the energy performance of new materials after their first application are to be presented  aPublisher supplied data 3aEuropean Union 3aceramics 3acoatings 3acomposite materials 3aenergy efficiency 3ainsulating materials 3alaws and regulations 3amarkets 3apolystyrenes 3aGreece 0aenergy efficiency 0abuildings 0acool material 0arenovation1 aAntoniadou, Panagiota0 tProcedia Environmental Sciences.g2017, v. 38 p.830-835dElsevier B.V.x1878-02967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.proenv.2017.03.1683Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01256naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001600140245008300156300002000239520017800259592002800437650002300465650002300488650003600511650003000547700001300577700001600590700001300606700001700619700001100636700002000647700001900667773013600686856007500822852000900897655001200906IND60659102420221120091845.0190827e20111011xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065910242DNAL7 a10.1039/c1cc14766h2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Baozong10aCharacterization of 4,4‚Ä≤-biphenylene-silicas and a chiral sensor for silicas  ap. 11495-11497.  aThe CD spectra of chiral 4,4‚Ä≤-biphenylene-silicas were measured and simulated using time-dependent density functional theory and a chiral sensor for silicas was developed.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical compounds 3achemical reactions 3acircular dichroism spectroscopy 3adensity functional theory1 aXu, Zhen1 aZhuang, Wei1 aChen, Yi1 aWang, Sibing1 aLi, Yi1 aWang, Mingliang1 aYang, Yonggang0 tChemical communications.g2011 Oct. 11, v. 47, no. 41 p.11495-11497dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26910x1364-548X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c1cc14766h3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03166naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002200145245012500167300001800292520153900310592002801849596006801877596004701945596012701992650001802119650002302137650001602160650002202176650001402198650001302212650001002225650002502235650002002260651001602280651001602296653001902312653002302331653002002354700001902374700002702393700002202420700002002442700001402462773012002476856007902596852000902675655001202684IND60674347420221118115046.0191025e20180519xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067434742DNAL7 a10.1093/treephys/tpy0572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aArbellay, Estelle10aTree-ring proxies of larch bud moth defoliation: latewood width and blue intensity are more precise than tree-ring width  ap. 1237-1245.  aReconstructions of defoliation by larch bud moth (LBM, Zeiraphera diniana Gn.) based on European larch (Larix decidua Mill.) tree rings have unraveled outbreak patterns over exceptional temporal and spatial scales. In this study, we conducted tree-ring analyses on 105 increment cores of European larch from the Valais Alps, Switzerland. The well-documented history of LBM outbreaks in Valais provided a solid baseline for evaluating the LBM defoliation signal in multiple tree-ring parameters. First, we used tree-ring width measurements along with regional records of LBM outbreaks to reconstruct the occurrence of these events at two sites within the Swiss Alps. Second, we measured earlywood width, latewood width and blue intensity, and compared these parameters with tree-ring width to assess the capacity of each proxy to detect LBM defoliation. A total of six LBM outbreaks were reconstructed for the two sites between AD 1850 and 2000. Growth suppression induced by LBM was, on average, highest in latewood width (59%), followed by total ring width (54%), earlywood width (51%) and blue intensity (26%). We show that latewood width and blue intensity can improve the temporal accuracy of LBM outbreak reconstructions, as both proxies systematically detected LBM defoliation in the first year it occurred, as well as the differentiation between defoliation and non-defoliation years. This study introduces blue intensity as a promising new proxy of insect defoliation and encourages its use in conjunction with latewood width.  aPublisher supplied data  aPBBEP2-146100aP300P3-158433cSwiss National Science Foundation  cBasler Stiftung f√ºr biologische Forschung  aNSERC RGPIN-2014-06387cNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canadadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100000038 3aLarix decidua 3aZeiraphera diniana 3adefoliation 3adendroclimatology 3aearlywood 3alatewood 3amoths 3aphytophagous insects 3atree physiology 3aAlps region 3aSwitzerland 0ablue intensity 0ainsect defoliation 0ainsect outbreak1 aJarvis, Ingrid1 aChavard√®s, Rapha√´l D1 aDaniels, Lori D.,1 aStoffel, Markus1 aOren, Ram0 tTree physiology.g2018 May 19, v. 38, no. 8 p.1237-1245dOxford University PresswJournal:jnl41003x1758-44697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/treephys/tpy0573Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02151naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094024002200130024001900152040001800171100001800189245007200207300001600279506007600295520075300371592002801124506003701152650001601189650001701205650002201222650001101244650003701255650004001292653001701332653001701349653001001366653001401376700001801390700002201408700002501430700001901455700001901474773012101493856008201614852000901696655001201705IND60089733120221207095541.0160728e20130419xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008973312DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbrc.2013.02.0822doi7 aPMC36910742pmcid7 a234543822pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCho, Yoon Sun10aFunctional inhibition of UQCRB suppresses angiogenesis in zebrafish  ap. 396-400.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aAs a subunit of mitochondrial complex III, UQCRB plays an important role in complex III stability, electron transport, and cellular oxygen sensing. Herein, we report UQCRB function regarding angiogenesis in vivo with the zebrafish (Danio rerio). UQCRB knockdown inhibited angiogenesis in zebrafish leading to the suppression of VEGF expression. Moreover, the UQCRB-targeting small molecule terpestacin also inhibited angiogenesis and VEGF levels in zebrafish, supporting the role of UQCRB in angiogenesis. Collectively, UQCRB loss of function by either genetic and pharmacological means inhibited angiogenesis, indicating that UQCRB plays a key role in this process and can be a prognostic marker of angiogenesis- and mitochondria-related diseases.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDanio rerio 3aangiogenesis 3aelectron transfer 3aoxygen 3aubiquinol-cytochrome-c reductase 3avascular endothelial growth factors 0aAngiogenesis 0aMitochondria 0aUQCRB 0aZebrafish1 aJung, Hye Jin1 aSeok, Seung Hyeok1 aPayumo, Alexander Y.1 aChen, James K.1 aKwon, Ho Jeong0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2013 Apr. 19, v. 433 p.396-400dElsevier Inc.x0006-291X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2013.02.0823Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03528naa a2200769 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245020000170520137800370592002801748650003201776650001201808650001301820650001001833650001601843650001901859650001501878650001801893650001901911650001401930650000901944650001701953650001501970650002501985650002302010653001202033653001602045653001802061653001502079653001802094653000902112653000802121653000702129653000802136653000802144653000902152653000802161653000802169653001002177653001002187653000802197653000902205653000902214653001202223653001502235700002302250700002102273700002202294700002202316700003002338700002202368700002402390700002102414700002102435700002102456700002002477700002302497700002002520773011102540856008602651852000902737655001202746IND60714118820221119212903.0220103e202011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071411882DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodres.2020.1097412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSandes, S√°vio10aWeissella paramesenteroides WpK4 plays an immunobiotic role in gut-brain axis, reducing gut permeability, anxiety-like and depressive-like behaviors in murine models of colitis and chronic stress  aThe relationship between inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and mood disorders is complex and involves overlapping metabolic pathways, which may determine comorbidity. Several studies have been shown that this comorbidity could worsen IBD clinical course. The treatment of ulcerative colitis is complex, and involves traditional therapy to promote the function of epithelial barrier, reducing exacerbated inflammatory responses. Recently, it has been shown that some probiotic strains could modulate gut-brain axis, reducing depressive and anxiety scores in humans, including IBD patients. Accordingly, this study aimed to evaluate the role of Weissella paramesenteroides WpK4 in murine models of ulcerative colitis and chronic stress. It was observed that bacterium ingestion improved health of colitis mice, reducing intestinal permeability, besides improving colon histopathological appearance. In stressed mice, bacterial consumption was associated with a reduced anxiety-like and depressive-like behaviors. In both assays, the beneficial role of W. paramesenteroides WpK4 was related to its immunomodulatory feature. It is possible to state that W. paramesenteroides WpK4 exerted their beneficial roles in gut-brain axis through their immunomodulatory effects with consequences in several metabolic pathways related to intestinal permeability and hippocampal physiology.  aPublisher supplied data 3aWeissella paramesenteroides 3aanxiety 3abacteria 3acolon 3acomorbidity 3adisease course 3aepithelium 3afood research 3ahistopathology 3aingestion 3amice 3apermeability 3aprobiotics 3atraditional medicine 3aulcerative colitis 0aColitis 0aComorbidity 0aMood disorder 0aProbiotics 0aPsychobiotics 0aCEUA 0aCpm 0aCt 0aDAI 0aDSS 0aIDO1 0aIBD 0aIRF 0aMyD88 0aNLRP3 0aTLR 0aTRIF 0aWpK4 0aWpK4Dss 0aWpK4Stress1 aFigueiredo, Naiara1 aPedroso, S√≠lvia1 aSant'Anna, Felipe1 aAcurcio, Leonardo1 aAbatemarco Junior, M√°rio1 aBarros, Patr√≠cia1 aOliveira, Fabr√≠cio1 aCardoso, Valbert1 aGeneroso, Simone1 aCaliari, Marcelo1 aNicoli, Jacques1 aNeumann, Elisabeth1 aNunes, √Ålvaro,0 tFood research international.g2020 Nov., v. 137 p.109741-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl48420x0963-99697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodres.2020.1097413Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02838naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245015300172300001800325520110600343536015501449592002801604650002401632650001901656650002401675650002201699650002201721650002001743650000901763650004301772650002101815650001501836650001301851650001701864650001301881653001701894653003701911653001801948653001701966653001401983653001001997700002102007700001702028700001902045700001802064700002002082773012302102856008602225852000902311655001202320IND60773346520221120135607.0220413e20220503xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077334652DNAL7 a10.1080/14786419.2020.18254282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKumar, Satyender10aSynthesis, molecular docking and ADMET prediction of novel swertiamarin analogues for the restoration of type-2 diabetes: an enzyme inhibition assay  ap. 2197-2207.  aSwertiamarin is a lead, biologically active compound obtained from Enicostemma littorale Blume and known to be identified for the anti-diabetic activity. Present work comprises the synthesis and structural optimization of seven novel swertiamarin analogues and those were not being reported elsewhere till date. Swertiamarin was isolated, followed by modifications that have been accomplished amidst fluorinating, acetylating and oxidizing agents and also performed chromatographic purity and characterization of analogues. Furthermore, the swertiamarin analogues were screened for dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-IV) enzyme inhibition with in silico studies. Besides, the pharmacokinetics and toxicity of analogues were predicted using ADMET software. In a nutshell, the compounds such as SNIPERSV-4 and SNIPERSV-7 have to pose good initial activity (‚àº48%) in comparison to standard DPP-IV inhibitor (Sitagliptin). The identified analogues were active against DPP-IV enzyme in preliminary screenings, and these findings would be beneficial for the new age researchers also for the therapy of diabetes.  aA special note of thanks to the Department of Pharmaceuticals, Ministry of Chemicals and Fertilizers, New Delhi, India for providing research funding.  aPublisher supplied data 3abioactive compounds 3achromatography 3acomputer simulation 3acomputer software 3aenzyme inhibition 3aglycemic effect 3alead 3anoninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 3apharmacokinetics 3aprediction 3aresearch 3atherapeutics 3atoxicity 0aSwertiamarin 0adipeptidyl peptidase-IV (DPP-IV) 0aanti-diabetic 0afluorination 0ain silico 0aADMET1 aNiguram, Prakash1 aBhat, Vedika1 aJinagal, Seema1 aJairaj, Vinod1 aChauhan, Neelam0 tNatural product research.g2022 May 3, v. 36, no. 9 p.2197-2207dTaylor & FranciswJournal:J000000126x1478-64277nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14786419.2020.18254283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02738naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245013200169300001600301520150200317592002801819650002501847650001101872650001501883650001301898650001401911650001101925650002101936650001801957650001401975650001701989650003902006650001302045650002702058650001002085700002102095700001902116773009902135856008502234852000902319655001202328IND60080877420221119125123.0140812e201306  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008087742DNAL7 a10.1016/j.exppara.2013.02.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBien, Justyna10aRecognition of antigens of three different stages of the Trichinella spiralis by antibodies from pigs infected with T. spiralis  ap. 129-137.  aInfective muscle larvae (ML), adults (Ad) and new born larvae (NBL) of Trichinella spiralis express many immunogenic proteins which can elicit a host protective response, and may be useful in the diagnosis of Trichinella infected humans and animals. The present study was carried out to identify T. spiralis antigens recognized by antibodies from pigs infected with T. spiralis. To that end, the crude extracts of ML, Ad, NBL and ML excretory‚Äìsecretory (E‚ÄìS) and Ad E‚ÄìS proteins were analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate polycrystalline gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). To identify antigens of T. spiralis that are recognized by host antibodies, crude extracts and E‚ÄìS proteins were subjected to immunoblot with antisera derived from pigs experimentally infected with 200 or 20,000 T. spiralis ML. Searching for T. spiralis antigens with diagnostic potential, immunoblots showed that all T. spiralis antisera, regardless of the infective dose, recognized common proteins in each examined life stage with molecular weights around 20‚Äì27kDa, 41kDa and 197‚Äì105kDa. Interestingly, all the common proteins were detected by T. spiralis sera throughout the infection, from 5days post infection (dpi) to 60dpi. These results extend our knowledge of specific antigenic components of T. spiralis. The finding of common components among all T. spiralis life stages may be useful in the preparation of parasite antigens for diagnostic use, as these antigens are relevant regardless of infection phase.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTrichinella spiralis 3aadults 3aantibodies 3aantigens 3aantiserum 3ahumans 3amolecular weight 3amuscle larvae 3aparasites 3aparasitology 3apolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 3aproteins 3asodium dodecyl sulfate 3aswine1 aCabaj, Wladyslaw1 aMoskwa, Bozena0 tExperimental parasitology.g2013 June, v. 134, no. 2 p.129-137dElsevier Inc.x0014-48947nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.exppara.2013.02.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03141naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002400150245015500174520158400329592002801913650002301941650001101964650001701975650002601992650002002018650001702038650001702055650001902072651001302091653001702104653003202121653002102153653002602174653001802200653002402218700006202242700006602304700002302370700002002393700005802413773013002471856008502601852000902686655001202695IND60734124220221117191954.0210518e202105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073412422DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ejsobi.2021.1033002doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHeepngoen, Pusanisa10aRelationships between physico-chemical, biological and functional approaches for soil quality assessment. A case study along a gradient of disturbance  aThe assessment of the impacts of land management on soil quality is crucial in the current environmental context. Among the many approaches available to assess soil quality, most of studies or monitoring programs consist in the measurement of stocks using an additive approach of physical, chemical and biological, parameters. More recently, functional methods have been developed to provide tools which better account the abiotic-biotic interactions. The objective of our study was to evaluate and compare the capacity of physico-chemical, biological and functional parameters to assess the effect of land management on soil quality over a gradient of disturbance based on rubber tree plantations in Chachoengsao province, Thailand. Three sets of indicators were applied based on i. soil physico-chemical analyses, ii. biological analyses, based on soil free-living nematode indices iii. functional analyses, with Biofunctool¬Æ indicators linked to three main soil functions (carbon transformation, nutrient cycling, soil structure maintenance). A soil quality index resulting from the aggregation of each set of indicators into a single score showed that functional assessment was the most sensitive to the gradient of disturbance. Co-inertia analysis between sets revealed a significant relationship between functional analysis and both physico-chemical and biological sets of indicators, whereas the two latter were not related. Our results validated the ability of the functional method to better reflect the complexity of the abiotic-biotic interactions of the soil system.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHevea brasiliensis 3acarbon 3acase studies 3afree-living nematodes 3aland management 3asoil biology 3asoil quality 3asoil structure 3aThailand 0aSoil quality 0aPhysico-chemical properties 0aNematode indices 0aFunctional indicators 0aBiofunctool¬Æ 0aCo-inertia analysis1 aThoumazeau, Alexis1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0758-139X1 aRenevier, Marie-Sophie1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8653-83161 aSajjaphan, Kannika1 aGay, Fr√©d√©ric1 aBrauman, Alain1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4865-29190 tEuropean journal of soil biology.g2021 May,  June, v. 104 p.103300-dElsevier Masson SASwJournal:jnl597945x1164-55637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ejsobi.2021.1033003Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01464naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245010000167520044300267592002800710650001400738650001200752650001400764650001300778650001400791653001300805653001900818653001800837700001800855700001600873700001500889700001400904773010200918856008501020852000901105655001201114IND60759543720221122203228.0220103e20220105xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075954372DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tetlet.2021.1535872doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Dachao10aSynthesis of functionized N-arylbenzotriazoles via palladium catalyzed intramolecular amination  aThe functionalized benzotriazoles are prepared by palladium catalyzed intramolecular amination of 2-bromodiaryltriazene.

Direction-selective (DS) circuits are an evolutionarily conserved retinal circuit motif ‚Äì from zebrafish to rodents to primates ‚Äì specialized for motion detection. During retinal development, neuronal subtypes that wire DS circuits form exquisitely precise connections with each other to shape the output of retinal ganglion cells tuned for specific speeds and directions of motion. In this review, we follow the chronology of DS circuit development in the vertebrate retina, including the cellular, molecular, and activity-dependent mechanisms that regulate the formation of DS circuits, from cell birth and migration to synapse formation and refinement. We highlight recent findings that identify genetic programs critical for specifying neuronal subtypes within DS circuits and molecular interactions essential for responses along the cardinal axes of motion. Finally, we discuss the roles of DS circuits in visual behavior and in certain human visual disease conditions. As one of the best-characterized circuits in the vertebrate retina, DS circuits represent an ideal model system for studying the development of neural connectivity at the level of individual genes, cells, and behavior.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDanio rerio 3aganglia 3ahumans 3aneurons 3aretina 0aVisual system 0aDirection selectivity 0aCircuit1 aScasny, Andrew J.1 aKolodkin, Alex L.0 tDevelopmental biology.g2021 Sept., v. 477 p.273-283dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12382x0012-16067nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ydbio.2021.06.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02452naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002100152245007800173300001600251520144900267592002801716650002001744650002401764650001101788650002601799650001801825650002401843650001101867650001501878700001801893700002201911773008601933856008602019852000902105655001202114IND60084837720221119140429.0141101e201103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008483772DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apenergy.2010.09.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTing, Chen-Ching10aDeveloping the dual system of wind chiller integrated with wind generator  ap. 741-747.  aThe successfully developed wind chiller in our CCT Lab. directly uses wind force to drive refrigeration system and hence reduces two times energy conversions between mechanical and electrical energies. The wind chiller needs high wind speed for its effective work due to the large working torque is required by the compressor. For the purpose of enlarging the applied wind field by the wind machine, this work aims to develop a dual system of wind chiller integrated with wind generator. The integrated wind generator can use the wind energy which cannot effectively drive the compressor. Therefore, the new developed dual system can apply larger range of the wind field and further increase the total working efficiency of the wind machine. A programmable logic controller (PLC) is applied in this wind forced dual system to select the wind chiller or the wind generator separately in terms of the rotational speed of the wind machine. In this work, the wind chiller is switched on while the accelerated rotational speed reaches 80rpm and off while the decelerated rotational speed reaches 60rpm. The integrated wind generator is switched on while the decelerated rotational speed reaches 60rpm and off while the decelerated rotational speed reaches 40rpm.

M.10aCorrelation of the Physicochemical Properties of Natural Organic Matter Samples from Different Sources to Their Effects on Gold Nanoparticle Aggregation in Monovalent Electrolyte  ap. 2188-2198.  aEngineered nanoparticles (NPs) released into natural environments will interact with natural organic matter (NOM) or humic substances, which will change their fate and transport behavior. Quantitative predictions of the effects of NOM are difficult because of its heterogeneity and variability. Here, the effects of six types of NOM and molecular weight fractions of each on the aggregation of citrate-stabilized gold NPs are investigated. Correlations of NP aggregation rates with electrophoretic mobility and the molecular weight distribution and chemical attributes of NOM (including UV absorptivity or aromaticity, functional group content, and fluorescence) are assessed. In general, the >100 kg/mol components provide better stability than lower molecular weight components for each type of NOM, and they contribute to the stabilizing effect of the unfractionated NOM even in small proportions. In many cases, unfractionated NOM provided better stability than its separated components, indicating a synergistic effect between the high and low molecular weight fractions for NP stabilization. Weight-averaged molecular weight was the best single explanatory variable for NP aggregation rates across all NOM types and molecular weight fractions. NP aggregation showed poorer correlation with UV absorptivity, but the exponential slope of the UV‚Äìvis absorbance spectrum was a better surrogate for molecular weight. Functional group data (including reduced sulfur and total nitrogen content) were explored as possible secondary parameters to explain the strong stabilizing effect of a low molecular weight Pony Lake fulvic acid sample to the gold NPs. These results can inform future correlations and measurement requirements to predict NP attachment in the presence of NOM.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorbance 3aelectrolytes 3aelectrophoresis 3afluorescence 3afulvic acids 3alakes 3amolecular weight 3ananogold 3ananoparticles 3anitrogen content 3aprediction 3asulfur 3asynergism1 aSpielman-Sun, Eleanor R.1 aSmall, Mitchell J.1 aTilton, Robert D.1 aLowry, Gregory V.0 tEnvironmental Science & Technology.g2015 Feb. 17, v. 49, no. 4 p.2188-2198dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fes505003d3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02573naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024003600110040001800146100002000164245004100184300001600225520131600241592002801557650002701585650001801612650002001630650001201650650002801662650000901690650001101699650004401710650002001754650000901774650004101783650002701824650004901851650004601900700002001946773010601966852000902072856008202081655001202163IND8310693520221118221958.0181010e198309  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND831069352DNAL7 a66364622pmid7 a10.1177/0300985883020005042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHarbison, M. L.10aMalignant Mesothelioma in Urban Dogs  ap. 531-540.  aClinical and postmortem materials from six dogs with a diagnosis of malignant mesothelioma were studied retrospectively. The dogs were urban pets with clinical signs of malignant effusions. Two mesotheliomas were pleural, one pericardial, and one peritoneal. Both pleura and pericardium were involved in one dog, and the pleura and peritoneum in another. On gross examination at necropsy, diffuse granular or velvety plaques covering mesothelial surfaces were found in all dogs; firm discrete pleural nodules also were present in two dogs. Neither distant mestastases nor areas of deep lung invasion were found. The tumors varied histologically, but the most common type was epithelial with a papillary pattern. Ultrastructurally, the neoplastic cells had prominent surface microvilli, numerous desmosomes, and tonofilaments. Lung tissue from these dogs and from control dogs was evaluated for the presence of ferruginous bodies. Asbestos bodies were found in three of five dogs with mesotheliomas but rarely were found in control dogs. As a group, the mesothelioma cases had significantly more asbestos bodies and total ferruginous bodies than controls. The clinical and morphologic appearance of canine mesothelioma is similar to human mesothelioma and also may be associated with exposure to airborne fibers.  aPublisher supplied data 3anoninfectious diseases 3aanimal health 3aanimal diseases 2aAnimals 2aDog Diseasesxpathology 2aDogs 2aFemale 2aHeart Neoplasmsxpathologyxveterinary. 2aLungxpathology 2aMale 2aMesotheliomaxpathologyxveterinary. 2aPericardiumxpathology 2aPeritoneal Neoplasmsxpathologyxveterinary. 2aPleural Neoplasmsxpathologyxveterinary.1 aGodleski, J.

G.,12aA review of the non-avian theropod track record and the implications for the Ontogenetic Niche Shift model  aMany Mesozoic formations have yielded substantial dinosaur dominated ichnofaunas, which help characterize coeval communities. When compared with dinosaurian skeletal data (faunal lists) from the same and /or coeval deposits, the completeness and diversity of trace and body fossil records may be shown to be of equal or quite different value for paleoecological analysis and interpretation. The size frequency distribution for >1,170 trackways from 17 theropod dominated Late Triassic-Cretaceous tracksites from North America and China is compared to the data used from the skeletal record to test the Ontogenetic Niche Shift (ONS) model. While track and body fossil databases are different in some regards, they are similar in others, notably in providing coherent size frequency data and useful taxonomic/ichnotaxonomic diversity estimates on a formation by formation or site by site basis. The cumulative, ichnological size frequency data, can be compared with the small, intermediate, and large or megatheropod body mass categories (<100, 100‚Äê1000 and¬†>¬†1000¬†kg) used in ONS analysis, and supports the conclusion that ~50%, 31% and 19% respectively of the track sample fall into these three categories. Thus, theropod track abundance is inversely proportional to size. Despite the small proportion of megatheropods track data reveals an increase in the maximum size of theropods through the Mesozoic.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMesozoic era 3abody weight 3afauna 3afossils 3afrequency distribution 3amodels 3aontogeny 3apaleoecology 3aChina 3aNorth America1 aXing, Lida0 tEarth-science reviews.g2021 Sept., v. 220 p.103715-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11685x0012-82527nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.earscirev.2021.1037153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02758naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245006800168300001600236520175800252592002802010650002002038650000902058650001102067651001102078700002102089700002802110700001402138700002102152700002302173700002102196773011302217856008102330852000902411655001202420IND60575019420221118062452.0170728e201707  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057501942DNAL7 a10.1007/s00704-016-1786-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGraczyk, Dariusz14aThe heat goes on‚Äîchanges in indices of hot extremes in Poland  ap. 459-471.  aOn the basis of temperature observations at 60 meteorological stations in Poland, changes in the indices associated with the presence of extremely high air temperatures were examined. Indices associated with heat waves, such as the number of hot days (T ‚Çò‚Çê‚Çì ‚â•30¬†¬∞C) in the summer months (June, July, August) and beyond the summer months (May, September), the number of extremely hot days (T ‚Çò‚Çê‚Çì ‚â•35¬†¬∞C), the duration of the longest hot spell in the year, as well as the number of tropical nights (T ‚Çò·µ¢‚Çô ‚â§20¬†¬∞C) were calculated. Spatial distribution of change rate in days per decade for the studied indices as well as the significance level of the observed trends is illustrated. Also current values of the studied indices (for 1991‚Äì2013) are examined and compared with the reference period, 1961‚Äì1990. For eight of 11 analysed indexes, increase has been detected in last decades with the help of the Mann-Kendall test at a significance level ‚â•0.05 or better, for a large group of stations. Statistically significant increases of the number of hot days in summer, the number of tropical nights in a year, and duration of the longest hot spell in summer were found for more than half of the stations. Distinct changes in the duration of heat waves were also noted. In 1961‚Äì1990, the longest hot spell lasted for 10¬†days while in 1991‚Äì2013, there were many hot spells longer than that, while the longest hot spell recorded in this period lasted for 17¬†days. Beyond summer, changes in the number of hot days were smaller. In May, a statistically significant increase was recorded for only three stations, while in September the downward trend was dominating and for eight stations it was statistically significant.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair temperature 3aheat 3asummer 3aPoland1 aPi≈Ñskwar, Iwona1 aKundzewicz, Zbigniew W.1 aHov, √ò.,1 aF√∏rland, E.

The modeling methodology follows a quasi-steady approach, where the refrigeration system and also the refrigerated compartments are modeled following steady-state and transient approaches, respectively. The mass, energy and momentum conservation principles were used to put forward the equation set, whereas experimental data were collected and used to reduce the model closing parameters such as the thermal conductances and capacitances. The experiments were carried out using a controlled temperature and humidity environmental chamber. The model predictions were compared to experimental data, when it was found that the energy consumption is well predicted by the model with a maximum deviation of ¬±2%. A sensitivity analysis was also carried out to identify opportunities for energy savings.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenergy 3aenergy conservation 3aenergy use and consumption 3aequations 3ahouseholds 3ahumidity 3amomentum 3aprediction 3arefrigeration 3arefrigerators 3asimulation models 3atemperature1 aHermes, Christian J.L.1 aGon√ßalves, Joaquim M.1 aMelo, Cl√°udio,0 tApplied energy.g2011 Mar., v. 88, no. 3 p.748-754dElsevier Ltdx0306-26197nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2010.09.0193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02796naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001800152245017700170300001600347520137700363592002801740650002801768650001401796650002701810650001401837650001001851650001701861650001101878650001801889650000901907650001701916650001201933650001401945650001801959653003401977653001502011653001302026700002002039700001802059700001502077700001502092773013502107856008702242852000902329655001202338IND60750198120221119113015.0211009e20211101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075019812DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2021.08.2252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Guojun10aGranzyme B and perforin produced by SEC2 mutant-activated human CD4+ T cells and CD8+ T cells induce apoptosis of K562 leukemic cells by the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway  ap. 284-290.  aStaphylococcal enterotoxin C2 (SEC2), a classical representative of superantigens, activates T cells that produce massive cytokines. This characteristic makes SEC2 a promising candidate drug for cancer immunotherapy. Previous study showed that ST-4, a SEC2 mutant, enhanced recognition of mouse T-cell receptor VŒ≤ regions, and activated the increased number of T cells that produced more cytokines. However, the underlying molecular mechanism for stimulation of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and antitumor effect on human tumor cells remains unknown. Herein, we showed that ST-4 significantly activated TCR VŒ≤ 12, 13A, 14, 15, 17, and 20 CD4‚Å∫ and CD8‚Å∫ T cells, which produced substantial amounts of granzyme B and perforin. These cytokines exhibited antitumor effect on K562 cells by promoting apoptosis and inducing S-phase cell cycle arrest. Conversely, the granzyme B inhibitor or perforin inhibitor significantly weakened antitumor effect of ST-4, accompanied by a decrease of cleaved proapoptotic BAX and cytochrome c, and an increase of antiapoptotic BCL2. Taken together, these data suggest that granzyme B and perforin produced by ST-4-activated CD4‚Å∫ T cells and CD8‚Å∫ T cells play a pivotal role in inducing K562 cell apoptosis by the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway, and support ST-4 as a potential candidate for cancer immunotherapy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantineoplastic activity 3aapoptosis 3acell cycle checkpoints 3acytokines 3adrugs 3aenterotoxins 3ahumans 3aimmunotherapy 3amice 3amitochondria 3amutants 3aneoplasms 3asuperantigens 0aStaphylococcus enterotoxin C2 0aGranzyme B 0aPerforin1 aZheng, Guoliang1 aJiang, Fengli1 aWu, Tianyi1 aWu, Lizhao0 tInternational journal of biological macromolecules.g2021 Nov. 01, v. 190 p.284-290dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12340x0141-81307nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2021.08.2253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02495naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024003600110040001800146100001800164245008200182300001600264520125700280592002801537650002101565650002701586650001801613650002001631650001201651650004101663650001101704650002201715650006401737650002901801650001701830650004901847700001601896773010601912852000902018856008202027655001202109IND8310694220221118221826.0181010e198309  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND831069422DNAL7 a66364672pmid7 a10.1177/0300985883020005122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGunson, D.

Five horses given phenylbutazone alone and four horses subjected to water deprivation alone did not develop papillary necrosis. Urinalyses were normal prior to water deprivation, and also after water deprivation in the horses that did not receive phenylbutazone, but the water-deprived, phenylbutazone-treated horses had many red blood cells, transitional epithelial cells, and large numbers of oxalate crystals in their urine. Ulceration of the alimentary tract was seen in more than 50% of these horses. Tongue ulceration was present in one of five horses given phenylbutazone and one of five horses which had phenylbutazone and water deprivation. Ulceration of the gastric mucosa was seen in two of the five phenylbutazone-treated horses, four of five horses with phenylbutazone treatment and water deprivation, and one of four horses with water deprivation alone. Severe colonic ulceration with perforation and peritonitis was present in one horse given phenyl-butazone for three months. No other significant changes in the small or large intestine were seen in the other 13 horses.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal nutrition 3anoninfectious diseases 3aanimal health 3aanimal diseases 2aAnimals 2aHorse Diseasesxetiologyxpathology. 2aHorses 2aKidneyxpathology 2aKidney Papillary Necrosisxetiologyxpathologyxveterinary. 2aPhenylbutazonextoxicity 2aTime Factors 2aWater Deprivationxdrug effectsxphysiology.1 aSoma, L.

Medium-range ensemble precipitation forecasts were employed using a hydrological model to predict the real-time reservoir inflow. Real-time optimization of the water release strategy determined a week in advance with an effective initial condition for hydropower generation and irrigation was conducted with different scenarios using dynamic programming considering inflow predictions.¬†The medium-range ensemble precipitation forecast conducted by the European Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasts was used to quantify precipitation for the study basin. The ensemble precipitation forecast with the hydrological model was employed for inflow prediction of the study basin which was located in a tropical climate with a distinct wet and dry season. The initial conditions of the hydrological model largely influenced the real-time inflow forecast. To determine the initial conditions of the model, the empirical data assimilation considering a drainage area factor was utilized and observed precipitation data were used for model input forcing data during the initial analysis period. This method improved the reservoir inflow prediction and real-time reservoir optimization using dynamic programming with considering ensemble forecasts provided more efficient operating decisions than employing historical data. The resulting information will be useful for water resource management, which may be adapted to other basins in the study region.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abasins 3acase studies 3adrainage 3adrought 3adry season 3ahydrologic models 3airrigation 3aprediction 3arivers 3atropics 3awater management 3awater power 3awatersheds 3aThailand 0aEnsemble inflow forecasting 0aData assimilation 0aDistributed hydrologic model 0aReservoir optimization 0aDynamic programing1 aTachikawa, Yasuto1 aIchikawa, Yutaka1 aYorozu, Kazuaki0 tJournal of hydrology.g2021 Dec., v. 38 p.100939-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23229x2214-58187nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ejrh.2021.1009393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02718naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002600149245016200175300001400337520134900351592002801700650001501728650001401743650001501757650002001772650003101792650002201823650001101845650001801856653001801874653002001892653002901912653001801941653001201959700006101971700003202032773016302064856008402227852000902311655001202320IND60734124820221117192153.0220307e202106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073412482DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aspen.2021.04.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDSouza, Stafny Melony10aComparative analysis of testis transcriptomes in laboratory cohorts of recently diverged allopatric Drosophila nasuta nasuta and Drosophila nasuta albomicans  ap. 46-54.  aExpression divergence, primarily defined as the proportion of differentially expressed genes, is one of the key parameters in assessing the evolutionary dynamics of diverging species. Most contributions toward expression differences between species and sexes come from testis tissue, which is the repertoire of rapidly diverging genes that can have a direct impact on speciation. To address the evolutionary dynamics among recently diverged Drosophila species, we analyzed testis transcriptomes of two members of nasuta subgroup of the immigrans species group: Drosophila nasuta nasuta and Drosophila nasuta albomicans. Using RNA-Seq and de novo assembly approach, we found that 96% of the transcriptome exhibited a conserved pattern of gene expression, typical of the recently diverged species'. The 4% of the characterized transcriptomes showing expression divergence had no influence of coding sequence variations. Four of the orthologous testicular genes are under relaxed positive selection, and the remaining 98% (n¬†=¬†597) exhibit strong purifying selection irrespective of their expression patterns. Overall, our analyses suggest that the recent divergence of this closely related species pair has had a minimal impact on coding sequences and their expression, thereby providing useful insights into early stages of species divergence.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDrosophila 3aallopatry 3aentomology 3agene expression 3agene expression regulation 3asequence analysis 3atestes 3atranscriptome 0aDrosophilidae 0aGene expression 0aSynonymous substitutions 0aTranscriptome 0aTrinity1 aPonnanna, Koushik1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3821-34931 aRamachandra, Nallur Basappa0 tJournal of Asia-Pacific entomology.g2021 June, v. 24, no. 2 p.46-54dElsevier B.V.aKorean Society of Applied EntomologywJournal:jnl4413786x1226-86157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aspen.2021.04.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02546naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002100139245013700160300001800297520120700315592002801522650002101550650001201571650001101583650002001594650001201614650001301626650001501639650000801654650001701662650001001679650001201689650001901701650000701720650001101727650001801738650001801756651001601774651001301790700002101803700002101824700002301845773012401868856007501992852000902067655001202076IND60536266520221122042648.0160806e20150217xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053626652DNAL7 a10.1021/es50503752doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLittle, Megan
E.10aMercury in Little Brown Bat (Myotis lucifugus) Maternity Colonies and Its Correlation with Freshwater Acidity in Nova Scotia, Canada  ap. 2059-2065.  aInsectivorous little brown bats are exposed to elevated concentrations of mercury (Hg) through their preference for aquatic-based prey. Here we investigated spatial patterns of total Hg (THg) in fur from 10 little brown bat maternity colonies across Nova Scotia, and assessed relationships with the acidity of nearby lakes and rivers. Total Hg concentrations were measured in fur samples from 149 adult female little brown bats. Values showed significant variation among colonies (mean range 3.76‚Äì27.38 Œºg/g, dry weight), and 48% of individuals had Hg concentrations in excess of the 10 Œºg/g threshold associated with neurochemical changes in Chiroptera conspecifics (n = 26) from Virginia. Average surface water acidity parameters (pH and acid neutralization capacity) within an 8 km radius of each maternity roost showed strong negative associations with average colony fur THg concentrations. This suggests that freshwater acidity in foraging grounds explains much of the variation in average fur THg concentrations in little brown bat colonies. These findings highlight the significant role that water quality may have on Hg bioaccumulation within terrestrial species that feed on aquatic prey.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMyotis lucifugus 3aacidity 3aadults 3abioaccumulation 3afemales 3aforaging 3afreshwater 3afur 3ainsectivores 3alakes 3amercury 3aneutralization 3apH 3arivers 3asurface water 3awater quality 3aNova Scotia 3aVirginia1 aBurgess, Neil M.1 aBroders, Hugh G.1 aCampbell, Linda M.0 tEnvironmental Science & Technology.g2015 Feb. 17, v. 49, no. 4 p.2059-2065dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fes50503753Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02618naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245019400171300001600365520115300381592002801534650001601562650002201578650002601600650000801626650002501634650001501659650001201674650000901686650001001695650001201705650002401717650001701741650001301758650003401771650001701805650002401822650001001846650001901856650002401875650001301899700001801912773009901930856008502029961001302114852000902127655001202136IND60080878020221119130906.0140812e201306  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008087802DNAL7 a10.1016/j.exppara.2013.03.0192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTucker, Mark L.12aA gene encoding a peptide with similarity to the plant IDA signaling peptide (AtIDA) is expressed most abundantly in the root-knot nematode (Meloidogyne incognita) soon after root infection  ap. 165-170.  aSmall peptides play important roles in intercellular signaling. Inflorescence deficient in abscission (ida) is an Arabidopsis mutant that does not abscise (shed) its flower petals. The IDA gene encodes a small, secreted peptide that putatively binds to two redundant receptor-like kinases (HAESA and HAESA-like2) that initiate a signal transduction pathway. We identified IDA-like (IDL) genes in the genomic sequence for Meloidogyne incognita and Meloidogyne hapla. No orthologous sequences were found in any other genus of nematodes. Transcript for both M. incognita and M. hapla IDLs were found in total RNA isolated from infected root systems of tomato, Solanum lycopersicum. Five and three prime RACE of RNA from M. incognita infected tomato roots revealed a sequence of 392nt that includes a poly (A) tail of 39nt. The open reading frame encodes a 47 aa protein with a putative 25 aa N-terminal signal peptide. Expression of MiIDL1 is very low in eggs and pre-parasitic J2 and rapidly increases in the first four days post inoculation (dpi) and then declines at approximately 14dpi. A proposed role for the root-knot nematode IDL is discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArabidopsis 3aMeloidogyne hapla 3aMeloidogyne incognita 3aRNA 3aSolanum lycopersicum 3aabscission 3acorolla 3aeggs 3agenes 3amutants 3aopen reading frames 3aparasitology 3apeptides 3aphosphotransferases (kinases) 3aroot systems 3aroot-knot nematodes 3aroots 3asignal peptide 3asignal transduction 3atomatoes1 aYang, Ronghui0 tExperimental parasitology.g2013 June, v. 134, no. 2 p.165-170dElsevier Inc.x0014-48947nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.exppara.2013.03.0193Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle01639naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002600140245016500166300002000331520042200351592002800773650001200801650002300813650002300836650001300859650001100872650001400883650001300897650001500910650002100925700001700946700002800963700003600991700001901027773013601046856007401182852000901256655001201265IND60661055520221118161901.0190827e20150825xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066105552DNAL7 a10.1039/c5cc05196g2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSenadi, Gopal Chandru10aPalladium(ii)-catalysed regioselective synthesis of 3,4-disubstituted quinolines and 2,3,5-trisubstituted pyrroles from alkenes via anti-Markovnikov selectivity  ap. 13795-13798.  aA novel strategy has been identified for the regioselective synthesis of 3,4-disubstituted quinolines and 2,3,5-trisubstituted pyrroles from simple alkenes via anti-Markovnikov selectivity under palladium catalysis.

The connection of enormous DGs into existing distribution network changes the operation of distribution systems. Because of the small X/R ratio and radial structure of distribution systems, DGs affect the daily Volt/Var control. This paper presents a new algorithm for multiobjective daily Volt/Var control in distribution systems including Distributed Generators (DGs). The objectives are costs of energy generation by DGs and distribution companies, electrical energy losses and the voltage deviations for the next day. A new optimization algorithm based on a Chaotic Improved Honey Bee Mating Optimization (CIHBMO) is proposed to determine the active power values of DGs, reactive power values of capacitors and tap positions of transformers for the next day. Since objectives are not the same, a fuzzy system is used to calculate the best solution. The plausibility of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated and its performance is compared with other methods on a 69-bus distribution feeder. Simulation results illustrate that the proposed algorithm has better outperforms the other algorithms.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3abusiness enterprises 3aelectric generators 3aelectricity 3aenergy 3aenergy costs 3ahoney bees 3aresource management0 tApplied energy.g2011 Mar., v. 88, no. 3 p.778-788dElsevier Ltdx0306-26197nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2010.08.0273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02711naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002400151245013000175300001600305520150400321592002801825650002101853650002701874650001801901650002001919650001101939650001501950650001901965650001401984650001701998650001402015650002402029700002202053700002002075700003702095773009902132856008502231852000902316655001202325IND60080878120221119130855.0140812e201306  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008087812DNAL7 a10.1016/j.exppara.2013.03.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJanssen, I. Jana I.10aCaenorhabditis elegans: Modest increase of susceptibility to ivermectin in individual P-glycoprotein loss-of-function strains  ap. 171-177.  aP-glycoproteins (Pgps) are members of the ABC transporter superfamily and are involved in detoxification mechanisms of single- and multicellular organisms. Their importance for survival of organisms in the presence of harmful drug concentrations has been widely studied in cancer cells but Pgp-dependent drug resistance of parasites has also been demonstrated. Ivermectin (IVM), a widely used anthelmintic in human and veterinary medicine, is a known substrate at least of mammalian Pgps and resistance against IVM is proposed to be associated with Pgps. The consequences of loss of Pgp function for the development of the model nematode Caenorhabditis elegans were analysed in the presence of IVM. Either strains missing only a single Pgp were used or Pgp activity generally was inhibited using verapamil (VPL). Loss-of-function of individual Pgp resulted in a statistically significant increase in IVM susceptibility in terms of impaired development with decreases in EC‚ÇÖ‚ÇÄ values between 1.5- and 4.3-fold. Absence of seven Pgps resulted in a higher impact on IVM susceptibility of C. elegans since it resulted in EC‚ÇÖ‚ÇÄ values decreased by 2.4- to 4.3-fold. This increase in IVM susceptibility was even more pronounced than that observed when Pgp function was blocked in general by VPL (approximately 2.5-fold). This study demonstrates clearly that Pgps are of importance for IVM detoxification in the model organism C. elegans and that some Pgps obviously have a higher impact than others.  aPublisher supplied data 3aABC transporters 3aCaenorhabditis elegans 3aanthelmintics 3adrug resistance 3ahumans 3aivermectin 3aneoplasm cells 3aparasites 3aparasitology 3averapamil 3aveterinary medicine1 aKr√ºcken, J√ºrgen1 aDemeler, Janina1 aSamson-Himmelstjerna, Georg von,0 tExperimental parasitology.g2013 June, v. 134, no. 2 p.171-177dElsevier Inc.x0014-48947nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.exppara.2013.03.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03200naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245011400171300001800285506011700303506007600420520128300496592002801779506003701807650001501844650000901859650001501868650001601883650002101899650001501920650002601935650002301961650001101984650002901995650001502024650001002039651001102049653001402060653001602074653001402090653001202104653001502116700007202131700006802203700007202271700002802343700002502371700007302396773009502469856008502564852000902649655001202658IND60753099220221207080518.0220425s2021    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075309922DNAL7 a10.1016/j.toxrep.2021.10.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aElmore, Sarah E.10aEvaluation of aflatoxin and fumonisin co-exposure in urine samples from healthy volunteers in northern Mexico  ap. 1734-1741.  aCreative Commons Attribution¬†4.0¬†Generic (CC BY-NC-ND¬†4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aAflatoxins (AF) and fumonisins (FB) are common contaminants of maize and have been associated with cancer, immune suppression, and growth stunting. In this work, AFM‚ÇÅ and FB‚ÇÅ were measured in urine samples of healthy volunteers from the metropolitan area of Monterrey, Mexico, while AF and FB were detected in foods collected near the sampling zone. Urine samples from 106 adults were analyzed using ultra-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry and toxins in foods were measured by fluorometry. The mean value of AFM‚ÇÅ and FB‚ÇÅ was 4.3 pg/mg creatinine from 76 samples (72 %), and 50 pg/mg creatinine from 75 samples (71 %), respectively. More than half of the samples (n = 56, 53 %) had detectable levels of both AFM‚ÇÅ and FB‚ÇÅ. No differences in toxin levels were found between males and females or between age groups, but AFM‚ÇÅ and FB‚ÇÅ levels were higher (p < 0.01) when detected as a single exposure compared to co-exposed. Some significant results were found when comparing AFM‚ÇÅ and FB‚ÇÅ levels among groups of people assigned to levels of food consumption. Food samples had average concentrations of 5.3 Œºg/kg for AF and 800 Œºg/kg for FB. The results showed that co-exposure to AF and FB is common in the metropolitan area of Monterrey.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aaflatoxins 3acorn 3acreatinine 3afluorometry 3afood consumption 3afumonisins 3aliquid chromatography 3ametropolitan areas 3apeople 3atandem mass spectrometry 3atoxicology 3aurine 3aMexico 0aAflatoxin 0aCo-Exposure 0aFumonisin 0aMexican 0aPopulation1 aTrevi√±o-Espinosa, Ram√≥n S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0351-05511 aGarcia-Mazcorro, Jose F.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6047-43611 aGonz√°lez-Barranco, Patricia1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8832-48911 aS√°nchez-Casas, Rosa M.1 aPhillips, Timothy D.1 aMarroqu√≠n-Cardona, Alicia G.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3973-71280 tToxicology reports.g2021, v. 8 p.1734-1741dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23254x2214-75007nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.toxrep.2021.10.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02967naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001500155245015500170300001600325520168500341592002802026650000802054650001302062650002002075650001802095650002402113650001302137650001302150653002002163653002402183653002002207653002102227653001702248700001802265700001302283700001402296700001602310700001402326700001802340773007702358856008902435852000902524655001202533IND60545397820221119170200.0160902e201502  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054539782DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2014.10.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Jin J.10aDiscrimination of excess toxicity from narcotic effect: Influence of species sensitivity and bioconcentration on the classification of modes of action  ap. 660-673.  aThe toxicity data of 2624 chemicals to fish, Daphniamagna, Tetrahymenapyriformis and Vibriofischeri were used to investigate the effects of species sensitivity and bioconcentration on excess toxicity. The results showed that 47 chemical classes were identified as having the same modes of action (MOAs) to all four species, but more than half of the classes were identified as having different MOAs. Difference in chemical MOAs is one of the reasons resulting in the difference in toxic effect to these four species. Other important reasons are the difference in sensitivity and bioconcentration of species. Among the four species, V. fischeri has the most compounds identified as reactive MOA. This may be due to some compounds can be easily absorbed into the bacteria, react with the DNA or proteins, disrupt the normal function of the cell and exhibit significantly greater toxicity to the bacteria. On the other hand, the skin and lipid content of aqueous organisms can strongly inhibit the bio-uptake for some reactive compounds, resulting in a less toxic effect than expected. D. magna is the most sensitive species and T. pyriformis is the least sensitive species of the four species. For a comparison of interspecies toxicity, we need to use the same reference threshold of excess toxicity. However, some reactive compounds may be identified as baseline or less inert compounds for low sensitive species from the threshold developed from high sensitive species. The difference in the discrimination of excess toxicity to different species is not only because of the difference in MOAs for some compounds, but also due to the difference in sensitivity and bioconcentration.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3abacteria 3abioaccumulation 3alipid content 3amechanism of action 3aproteins 3atoxicity 0aToxic mechanism 0aSpecies sensitivity 0aExcess toxicity 0aBioconcentration 0aInterspecies1 aWang, Xiao H.1 aWang, Yu1 aWen, Yang1 aQin, Wei C.1 aSu, Li M.1 aZhao, Yuan H.0 tChemosphere.g2015 Feb., v. 120 p.660-673dElsevier Ltdx0045-65357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2014.10.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01895naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002200152245004400174300001600218500001500234520082700249592002801076650001601104650001201120650001201132650001801144650000901162650001901171650002201190650001601212650001201228650002701240653002501267700001801292700001801310773008601328856008601414852000901500655001201509IND60084838320221119134802.0141101e201103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008483832DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apenergy.2010.08.0242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMills, Randell L.10aContinuous hydrino thermal power system  ap. 789-798.  a2019-12-06  aThe specifics of a continuous hydrino reaction system design are presented. Heat from the hydrino reactions within individual cells provide both reactor power and the heat for regeneration of the reactants. These processes occur continuously and the power from each cell is constant. The conversion of thermal power to electrical power requires the use of a heat engine exploiting a cycle such as a Rankine, Brayton, Stirling, or steam-engine cycle. Due to the temperatures, economy goal, and efficiency, the Rankine cycle is the most practical and can produce electricity at 30‚Äì40% efficiency with a component capital cost of about $300 per kW electric. Conservatively, assuming a conversion efficiency of 25% the total cost with the addition of the boiler and chemical components is estimated at $1064 per kW electric.  aPublisher supplied data 3aelectricity 3aengines 3aboilers 3acost analysis 3aheat 3aelectric power 3aenergy efficiency 3atemperature 3acapital 3agenerators (equipment) 0aboilers (processing)1 aZhao, Guibing1 aGood, William0 tApplied energy.g2011 Mar., v. 88, no. 3 p.789-798dElsevier Ltdx0306-26197nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2010.08.0243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02487naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024003600110040001800146100002200164245005500186300001600241520104300257592002801300650004101328650001801369650002001387650002801407650001201435650002101447650003201468650004901500650004901549650002101598650001101619650005401630650001101684650002101695650002001716650005401736650001401790650001001804700001801814773010601832852000901938856008201947655001202029IND8310693820221118221737.0181010e198309  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND831069382DNAL7 a63146302pmid7 a10.1177/0300985883020005082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMacLachlan, N.

The earliest lesions after virus inoculation were a severe necrotizing encephalitis, which was most prominent in the cerebrum, and an associated nonsuppurative meningitis. At birth, the brains of infected fetuses had thin-walled cerebral hemispheres, dilated lateral ventricles, and cerebral cysts. No gross lesions were observed in the brain stem or cerebellum. Two morphologically different lesions were present in the brain of a fetus sacrificed 20 days after virus inoculation. There were discrete foci of hemorrhagic cerebral necrosis that resembled infarcts and widespread microcavitations of the intermediate and subventricular zones. Changes consistent with vascular damage were present in the brains of fetuses sacrificed 12 and 20 days after virus inoculation. Calves with bluetongue virus-induced hydranencephaly would have poor viability, but they would not be expected to have any significance as virus reservoirs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aviral diseases of animals and humans 3aanimal health 3aanimal diseases 2aAnencephalyxveterinary 2aAnimals 2aAnimals, Newborn 2aAntibodies, Viralxanalysis 2aBluetonguexetiologyximmunologyxpathology. 2aBluetongue virusximmunologyxpathogenicity. 2aBrainxpathology 2aCattle 2aCattle Diseasesxetiologyximmunologyxpathology. 2aFemale 2aFetusxpathology 2aGestational Age 2aHydranencephalyxetiologyxpathologyxveterinary. 2aPregnancy 2aSheep1 aOsburn, B.

We herein report the synthesis of glycodendrimers and glycodentromers crowned with galactose units by harnessing an expeditious synthesis of dendrimer core 18 and dentromer core 19, divergently with branching directionality (1 ‚Üí 2) and (1 ‚Üí 3), respectively. A competent, double stage convergent synthetic path was chosen to facilitate ease of refining and spectroscopic elucidations. By exploiting a Cu(i)-catalyzed azide‚Äìalkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC) reaction strategy, we successfully developed a new series of galactosylated dendrimers 20, 21, 22, and 24 containing 6, 12, 18, and 18 peripheral galactose units, respectively. We are first to report the practical synthesis of 9-peripheral galactose coated glycodentromer 23 (0·µó ∞ generation) and 27-peripheral galactose coated glycodentromer 25 (1À¢·µó generation). These synthesized scaffolds were characterized by spectral studies such as ¬πH, ¬π¬≥C NMR, FT-IR, MALDI-TOF MS, HRMS and SEC analysis. Additionally, gel permeation chromatography depicted the regular progression in size from 6 to 27-peripheral galactose coated glycodendrimers along with glycodentromers, with their high monodispersity. Also, the glyco-dendrimers and dentromers synthesized from two different hypercore units i.e. dendrimers core (18) and dentromer core (19), have been supported by their UV-visible absorbance and emission spectroscopy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorbance 3abranching 3acycloaddition reactions 3adendrimers 3agalactose 3agel chromatography 3ahorses 3arefining 3aspectral analysis 3aspectroscopy 3asynthesis1 aSingh., Anoop S.1 aMukherjee, Rishav1 aTiwari, Vinod K.0 tRSC advances.g2020 Aug. 26, v. 10, no. 52 p.31553-31562dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d0ra05289b3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02561naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001700139245010800156300001800264520146600282592002801748650002101776650001701797650002901814650001601843650001801859650001001877650002501887651001001912700001801922700001801940700001501958700001801973773012401991856007502115852000902190655001202199IND60536266920221122052728.0160806e20150217xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053626692DNAL7 a10.1021/es505136k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Runzeng10aOccurrence of Synthetic Phenolic Antioxidants and Major Metabolites in Municipal Sewage Sludge in China  ap. 2073-2080.  aSynthetic phenolic antioxidants (SPAs) are one group of widely used additive chemicals, which have not yet had focused attention except for a few compounds such as 2,6-di-tert-butyl-4-methylphenol (BHT). In this study, the occurrence and composition profiles of 12 frequently used SPAs and three BHT metabolites were investigated in fifty-six sludge samples collected from individual wastewater treatment plants in China. Eleven SPAs were positively found in the sludge samples, in which, to our knowledge, eight SPA compounds were identified for the first time in the environment. BHT, 4-tert-octylphenol (4-tOP), and 2,4,6-tri-tert-bultylphenol (AO 246) were the most dominant SPAs in the sludge at mean concentrations of 4.14 Œºg/g, 374 ng/g, and 98.1 ng/g d.w. (dry weight). Meanwhile, three BHT metabolites, including 3,5-di-tert-butyl-4-hydroxybenzaldehyde (BHT-CHO), 2,6-di-tert-butyl-1,4-benzoquinone (BHT-Q), and 2,6-di-tert-butyl-4-hydroxy-4-methyl-2,5-cyclohexadienone (BHT-quinol), were also found in most of the samples (>98.2%) with mean concentrations of 141, 562, and 225 ng/g d.w., respectively. The activated sludge system (anaerobic, anoxic, and oxic tanks) of a wastewater treatment plant was further investigated for the removal efficiencies of the SPAs. High removal efficiencies (80.1‚Äì89.2%) were found for the six detected SPAs in the aqueous phase, while generation of large proportions of the three BHT metabolites was also observed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactivated sludge 3aantioxidants 3abutylated hydroxytoluene 3ametabolites 3asewage sludge 3atanks 3awastewater treatment 3aChina1 aSong, Shanjun1 aLin, Yongfeng1 aRuan, Ting1 aJiang, Guibin0 tEnvironmental Science & Technology.g2015 Feb. 17, v. 49, no. 4 p.2073-2080dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fes505136k3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02794naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245011500168300001600283520140300299592002801702650001301730650002201743650002201765650001401787650001101801650002001812650001701832650001201849650002601861700002401887700001901911700002301930700001901953700001801972700002301990700001802013700002002031700001902051700002202070700002002092700002802112773009402140856008102234852000902315655001202324IND60438836520221120233946.0151024e201509  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6043883652DNAL7 a10.1007/s00425-015-2291-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBidel, Luc P. R.10aDynamics of flavonol accumulation in leaf tissues under different UV-B regimes in Centella asiatica (Apiaceae)  ap. 545-559.  aMAIN CONCLUSION : A cumulative effect of UV-B doses on epidermal flavonol accumulation was observed during the first week of a time course study in Centella asiatica (Apiaceae). However, once flavonol levels had peaked, additional accumulation was possible only if higher daily UV-B irradiances were applied. We aimed to understand the dynamics of flavonol accumulation in leaf tissues using non-destructive spectroscopy and HPLC‚Äìmass spectrometry. When leaves that had grown without UV-B were given brief daily exposures to low-irradiance UV-B, they accumulated flavonols, predominantly kaempferol-3-O-Œ≤-D-glucuronopyranoside and quercetin-3-O-Œ≤-D-glucuronopyranoside, in their exposed epidermis, reaching a plateau after 7¬†days. More prolonged UV-B exposures or higher doses eventually augmented flavonol concentrations even in non-exposed tissues. If UV-B irradiance was subsequently reduced, leaves appeared to lose their ability to accumulate further flavonols in their epidermis even if the duration of daily exposure was increased. A higher irradiance level was then necessary to further increase flavonol accumulation. When subsequently acclimated to higher UV-B irradiances, mature leaves accumulated less flavonols than did developing ones. Our study suggests that levels of epidermal flavonols in leaves are governed primarily by UV-B irradiance rather than by duration of exposure.  aPublisher supplied data 3aApiaceae 3aCentella asiatica 3aexposure duration 3aflavonols 3aleaves 3alight intensity 3aspectroscopy 3atissues 3aultraviolet radiation1 aChomicki, Guillaume1 aBonini, Fabien1 aMondolot, Laurence1 aSoul√©, Julien1 aCoumans, Marc1 aLa Fisca, Philippe1 aBaissac, Yves1 aPetit, Virginie1 aLoiseau, Alain1 aCerovic, Zoran G.1 aGould, Kevin S.1 aJay-Allemand, Christian0 tPlanta.g2015 Sept., v. 242, no. 3 p.545-559dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx0032-09357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00425-015-2291-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01788naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001600140245014200156300002000298500001400318520062100332592002800953650001600981650001300997650001201010650002101022650001401043650002301057650001801080650001401098650001801112700001501130700001601145700001701161700001601178773012501194856007401319852000901393655001201402IND60708591520221122080152.0200828e20200827xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070859152DNAL7 a10.1039/d0ra05374k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhu, Anlian10aBiocompatible ionic liquid [Betaine][H‚ÇÇPO‚ÇÑ] as a reusable catalyst for the substitution of xanthen-9-ol under solvent-free conditions  ap. 31662-31669.  aNAL-light  aAn ionic liquid, namely [Betaine][H‚ÇÇPO‚ÇÑ], was found to be an efficient catalyst for the direct substitution reaction of xanthen-9-ol with different nucleophiles under solvent-free conditions.

However, the low utilization of carbonyls hindered their potential applications in energy storage. Herein, a novel œÄ-conjugated polyimide (PBPI) based on biphenyl diimide (BPI) containing two seven-membered imide rings is developed. PBPI is used as an anode material for organic Li-ion batteries, which show high conductivity and insolubility in the electrolyte and enable intercalation of four Li-ions per BPI unit, thus contributing to a reversible capacity of 136 mA h g‚Åª¬π at 100 mA g‚Åª¬π with coulombic efficiency close to 100%. Moreover, the battery based on PBPI manifested superior high-rate performance (65 mA h g‚Åª¬π at 2000 mA g‚Åª¬π) as well as significant cycling stability (over 1600 cycles at 100 mA g‚Åª¬π). Remarkably, the full redox-active site (CÓÄÅO) utilization of an aromatic diimide core to achieve its full potential applications is reported for the first time. This work provides a new strategy for developing redox œÄ-conjugated polyimides and accommodation of more alkaline ions for high performance battery systems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanodes 3acarbonyl compounds 3aelectrical conductivity 3aelectrolytes 3aimides 3alithium batteries 3apolymers1 aZhang, Bingjie1 aZhang, Yueyan1 aYan, Ni1 aHe, Gang0 tRSC advances.g2020 Aug. 21, v. 10, no. 52 p.31049-31055dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d0ra05483f3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03375naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002800147245014500175300001600320500001500336520164900351592002802000650001202028650001102040650002102051650001302072650001202085650001702097650002602114650002102140650002102161650001302182650001102195650001702206650001402223650000902237650002502246650002302271650001402294650001202308650004902320650003002369650001602399650001302415650002302428653001702451700003002468700002002498700001802518700001902536700002202555700002402577773009402601856008102695852000902776655001202785IND60438836720221121015236.0151024e201509  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6043883672DNAL7 a10.1007/s00425-015-2308-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCvetanoviƒá, Aleksandra10aComparative analysis of antioxidant, antimicrobiological and cytotoxic activities of native and fermented chamomile ligulate flower extracts  ap. 721-732.  a2019-12-06  aMAIN CONCLUSION : The work investigated differences in apigenin content, as well as in other compounds, and examined the chemical profiles, antioxidant, antimicrobial and cytotoxic effects of extracts obtained from native and fermented chamomile ligulate flowers. Chamomile (Chamomilla recutita L.) has a long history of being used as a medicinal plant due to many health benefits, including antiinflammatory, anticancer, antispasmodic, radical-scavenging effects and others. Apigenin is recognized as one of the most bioactive phenolic compounds in chamomile. In comparison to its bound forms, which include mostly apigenin-7-O-Œ≤-glucoside and various acylated forms, the aglycone is attributed with much higher bioactivity. Due to this fact, in this work ligulate florets of chamomile anthodium were subjected to a fermentation process using native chamomile enzymes to hydrolyze bound forms of apigenin to free aglycone. The contents of apigenin and apigenin-7-O-Œ≤-glucoside were determined in both fermented and nonfermented samples by UHPLC-MS‚ÄìMS analysis to define the efficiency of conversion. After defining their chemical profiles, the extracts of fermented and nonfermented chamomile samples were also compared with respect to their antioxidant, antimicrobial and cytotoxic effects. The antioxidant effects of the obtained extracts were defined by electron spin resonance analysis for hydroxyl and superoxide radicals. The antimicrobial activity was defined for eight microbial strains, whereas cytotoxic activity was evaluated using two human cell lines (human cervix carcinoma and human rhabdomyosarcoma) and murine fibroblasts.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenzymes 3acervix 3amedicinal plants 3aextracts 3astrains 3afermentation 3aMatricaria chamomilla 3asuperoxide anion 3ahuman cell lines 3asampling 3ahumans 3acytotoxicity 3achamomile 3amice 3aantioxidant activity 3aparasympatholytics 3acarcinoma 3aflorets 3aelectron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aanti-infective properties 3afibroblasts 3aapigenin 3aphenolic compounds 0aantioxidants1 a≈†varc-Gajiƒá, Jaroslava,1 aZekoviƒá, Zoran1 aSaviƒá, Sa≈°a1 aVuliƒá, Jelena1 aMa≈°koviƒá, Pavle1 aƒÜetkoviƒá, Gordana0 tPlanta.g2015 Sept., v. 242, no. 3 p.721-732dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx0032-09357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00425-015-2308-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01313naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002300140245014100163300002000304520035400324592002800678650002300706650002300729650001600752700002500768700002200793773013700815856007400952852000901026655001201035IND60661056120221118162553.0190827e20150924xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066105612DNAL7 a10.1039/c5cc05205j2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFrolova, Lyubov A.14aThe chemical origin of the p-type and n-type doping effects in the hybrid methylammonium‚Äìlead iodide (MAPbI‚ÇÉ) perovskite solar cells  ap. 14917-14920.  aIn the present Communication we discuss a field-induced and photoinduced self-doping chemistry resulting in the formation of the positively and negatively charged vacancies in the MAPbI‚ÇÉ perovskite films.

Native potato starch (NPS) anti-freezing hydrogels were formed at ‚àí10¬†¬∞C, ‚àí18¬†¬∞C, ‚àí30¬†¬∞C, and¬†‚àí¬†50¬†¬∞C with 6‚Äì9¬†kPa tensile strength and 100‚Äì230% elongation at break. The compressive stress of anti-freezing hydrogels at different environmental temperatures increased from 18.586¬†kPa to 36.551¬†kPa with the glass transform temperature of starch hydrogels dropped to ‚àí50¬†¬∞C. The anti-freezing hydrogels showed excellent water retention ability, which could maintain a water content of 55% after 7¬†days at ambient temperature. The prototyping of anti-freezing starch hydrogels broadens the applications of starch in food, adhesives, medical materials, and intelligent materials.  aPublisher supplied data 3aambient temperature 3acold tolerance 3aglass 3ahydrogels 3apotato starch 3aseawater 3astarch 3atensile strength 3awater content 0aStarch hydrogels 0aFreeze-tolerance 0aInk printing1 aChen, Xiaoyu1 aXu, Zihan1 aJi, Na1 aXiong, Liu1 aSun, Qingjie0 tInternational journal of biological macromolecules.g2021 Nov. 01, v. 190 p.382-389dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12340x0141-81307nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2021.08.2353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03301naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002800151245012900179300001600308520195600324592002802280650002102308650002302329650002502352650002502377650002802402650001202430650001002442650003302452650002002485650000902505650001002514650001402524650001702538650003002555650002702585651001702612700002202629700002302651773009902674856008502773852000902858655001202867IND60080878820221119130539.0140812e201306  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008087882DNAL7 a10.1016/j.exppara.2013.02.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEl-Beshbishy, Hesham A.10aMolecular characterization of Leishmania infection in sand flies from Al-madinah Al-munawarah province, western Saudi Arabia  ap. 211-215.  aCutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) is caused by various species of the genus Leishmania. The disease is considered a major health problem in different areas of Saudi Arabia including Al-madinah Al-munawarah province. We aimed to identify Leishmania species isolated from sand fly vectors by molecular analysis. Sand fly sampling was carried out from May 2010 to October 2010 in province of Al-madinah Al-munawarah from four different localities. Female sand flies collected were subjected to DNA extraction followed by molecular analysis using the semi-nested PCR and conventional PCR protocols, respectively, against minicircle kDNA and ribosomal internal transcribed spacer 1 (ITS1-rDNA). The PCR positive specimens against ITS1-rDNA locus were digested for further confirmation of species identification. A total of 2910 sand flies were collected. Phlebotomus papatasi accounted for 93.8% (1673 males and 1057 females), however, the number of Phlebotomus sergenti was only 180 (109 males and 71 females). Sixty-two out of 250 (23.7%) female P. papatasi tested for Leishmania parasite were positive for Leishmania major using the semi-nested PCR method against kDNA. All of the 62 positive specimens produced a band size 650bp. A 31% of female P. sergenti were positive against kDNA of Leishmania tropica and produced a 720bp band. These positive P. sergenti for L. tropica DNA produced ITS1-PCR-RFLP profile showed two bands of ‚àº200bp and 57bp which are specific for L. tropica, confirming the presence of L. tropica in P. sergenti. However, the ITS1-PCR-RFLP profile showed two bands of ‚àº203bp and 132bp which are specific for L. major in P. papatasi. We concluded that, the semi-nested PCR method against kDNA and the ITS1-PCR-RFLP analysis are useful tools for molecular identification of both L. major and L. tropica. A multicenter study is necessary in order to evaluate the extent of the disease and functional analysis of new Leishmania genes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLeishmania major 3aLeishmania tropica 3aPhlebotomus papatasi 3aPhlebotomus sergenti 3acutaneous leishmaniasis 3afemales 3agenes 3ainternal transcribed spacers 3akinetoplast DNA 3aloci 3amales 3aparasites 3aparasitology 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aspecies identification 3aSaudi Arabia1 aAl-Ali, Khalil H.1 aEl-Badry, Ayman A.0 tExperimental parasitology.g2013 June, v. 134, no. 2 p.211-215dElsevier Inc.x0014-48947nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.exppara.2013.02.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02166naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001900152245010700171300001400278520091600292592002801208650001501236650001501251650001501266650002101281650001501302650002201317650001301339650001501352650002201367650002401389650001101413650001901424650002201443700001501465700001601480700001601496773011401512856008601626990002301712852000901735655001201744IND60113177120221120100012.0141111e20110701xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011317712DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jelechem.2011.03.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFeng, Xiaomiao10aDirect electron transfer and electrocatalysis of hemoglobin immobilized on graphene‚ÄìPt nanocomposite  ap. 28-33.  aA novel hemoglobin (Hb) electrode has been presented through adsorbing Hb onto graphene‚ÄìPt nanocomposite.

However, limited studies have assessed the non-target effects of these biocontrol agents. The present study aimed to investigate the antagonistic efficacy of B. subtilis (MTCC 2274) and T. harzianum (MTCC 3928) in mitigation of Fusarium wilt, and to study their non-target effects on the rhizospheric bacterial community in tomato. In planta assay revealed that the consortium of B. subtilis and T. harzianum exhibited the highest disease reduction (56%), whereas with chemical control it was 48.7% as compared to untreated control. Also, the impact of the dual inoculation on the bacterial community was qualitatively and quantitatively monitored by PCR-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) and qPCR, respectively by employing 16S rRNA as a marker. DGGE profiles generated from rhizospheric samples from treatment (90 DAS) with T. harzianum and B. subtilis, and chemical treatment formed a cluster with 72% similarity. It highlighted the enhancement in bacterial community in comparison to untreated control. The phylogenetic analysis of excised bands showed the presence of ecologically important species (Desulfotomaculum thermoacetoxidans, Microcoleus sp., Thermoactinomyces sp. and Nocardioides sp.) in soil treated with dual inoculation. Furthermore, qPCR of rhizospheric soil (90 DAS) treated with both inoculants showed a gene copy number/g dry soil of 2.9 x 104 in comparison to untreated control (8.8 x 103) that confirmed the positive change in bacterial members. These results demonstrated the integrated role of biocontrol agents towards soil health improvement along with mitigation of Fusarium wilt.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillus subtilis 3aDesulfotomaculum thermoacetoxidans 3aFusarium wilt 3aMicrocoleus 3aNocardioides 3aSolanum lycopersicum 3aThermoactinomyces 3aTrichoderma harzianum 3abacterial communities 3abiological control 3abiological control agents 3achemical control 3achemical treatment 3adenaturing gradient gel electrophoresis 3agene dosage 3aphylogeny 3aplant pathogenic fungi 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3aribosomal RNA 3asoil 3asoil quality 3atomatoes 0aBiocontrol agent 0aAntagonism 0aFusarium oxysporum f. sp. lycopersici 0a16S rRNA gene 0aqPCR1 aSharma, Satyawati1 aSharma, Shilpi0 tBiological control.g2019 Aug. 06, dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl48419x1049-96447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biocontrol.2019.1040693Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02928naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002600151245010200177300001800279520094700297536056101244592002801805596000801833596005201841650002101893650002301914650001501937650001101952650003101963650002901994650000902023650000702032650001402039650002502053653001702078653001402095700002502109700002602134700003002160700003102190700003402221773012002255856008602375852000902461655001202470IND60773343220221121161157.0220413e20220512xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077334322DNAL7 a10.1080/09593330.2020.18472052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShonza, Nasibu Samson10aCrude oil wastewater treatment by electrocoagulation in a continuous process with polarity switch  ap. 1700-1708.  aThe influence of the distance between electrodes, electrical current, and flow rate of emulsified crude oil in water effluent through an electrocoagulation reactor was studied. Power switch at an interval of 30‚ÄÖs was used to reduce electrode passivation. The output variables were power consumption, pH, and oil removal from effluent. There was no significant change in the output variables with the working time of the reactor. The final pH was between 7.5 and 9.5 depending on the input variables. It increases with higher electrical current and tends to decrease with increased flow rate. Increasing electrical current tends to increase while increasing either distance between electrodes or the flow rate tends to reduce oil removal. Using a 2.88‚ÄÖL reactor, it is possible to treat 7.12‚ÄÖL of effluent in one hour, removing 78% of the crude oil, keeping final pH at 8.3, and this system will have an energy consumption of 21.6‚ÄÖkWh.  aThis study was financed in part by the Coordena√ß√£o de Aperfei√ßoamento de Pessoal de N√≠vel Superior ‚Äì Brasil (CAPES) ‚Äì Finance Code 001.

The point‚Äêof‚Äêcare (POC) ELISA assay uses the same biologic reagents as the quantitative NT‚ÄêproBNP ELISA. Previous studies have evaluated the sensitivity and specificity of the POC ELISA in cats with cardiac disease. OBJECTIVES: To prospectively evaluate the diagnostic utility of the POC ELISA in a select population of cats. ANIMALS: Thirty‚Äêeight client‚Äêowned cats presented to the University of Florida Cardiology Service for cardiac evaluation. Fifteen apparently healthy cats recruited as part of another study. METHODS: Physical examination and echocardiography were performed in all cats. The POC ELISA was assessed visually as either positive or negative by a reader blinded to the echocardiographic findings, and results were analyzed relative to quantitative assay results. RESULTS: Twenty‚Äêsix cats were diagnosed with underlying cardiac disease, and 27 cats were considered free of cardiac disease. Cats with cardiac disease included: 21 with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, 2 with unclassified cardiomyopathy, 2 with restrictive cardiomyopathy, and 1 with 3rd degree atrioventricular (AV) block. The POC ELISA differentiated cats with cardiac disease with a sensitivity of 65.4% and specificity of 100%. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: The POC NT‚ÄêproBNP ELISA performed moderately well in a selected population of cats. A negative test result cannot exclude the presence of underlying cardiac disease, and a positive test result indicates that cardiac disease likely is present, but further diagnostic investigation would be indicated for a definitive diagnosis.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abrain 3acardiomyopathy 3acats 3aclinical examination 3aechocardiography 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3anatriuretic peptides 3apoint-of-care systems 3aFlorida1 aBeatty, S.S.1 aEstrada, A.H.1 aWinter, B.1 aBohannon, M.1 aSosa, I.1 aHanscom, J.1 aMainville, C.A.1 aGallagher, A.E.0 tJournal of veterinary internal medicine.g2017 July, v. 31, no. 4 p.994-999dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl43440x0891-66407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jvim.147763Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03478naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006200148245011800210300001800328520181000346592002802156596004102184596003502225596004402260596005002304650002202354650001402376650003302390650002502423650002902448650001902477650001102496650002202507650001402529650000902543650001402552650001602566650002102582651001502603653001502618653001902633653002002652653002702672700002602699700002002725773013502745856008302880852000902963655001202972IND60758683420221117040400.0211202e20210820xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075868342DNAL7 a10.1094/PDIS-03-20-0485-RE2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRosenthal, Lisa M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4030-758710aSporulation Potential of Phytophthora ramorum Differs Among Common California Plant Species in the Big Sur Region  ap. 2209-2216.  aSudden oak death (SOD), caused by the generalist pathogen Phytophthora ramorum, has profoundly impacted California coastal ecosystems. SOD has largely been treated as a two-host system, with Umbellularia californica as the most transmissive host, Notholithocarpus densiflorus less so, and remaining species as epidemiologically unimportant. However, this understanding of transmission potential primarily stems from observational field studies rather than direct measurements on the diverse assemblage of plant species. Here, we formally quantify the sporulation potential of common plant species inhabiting SOD-endemic ecosystems on the California coast in the Big Sur region. This study allows us to better understand the pathogen‚Äôs basic biology, trajectory of SOD in a changing environment, and how the entire host community contributes to disease risk. Leaves were inoculated in a controlled laboratory environment and assessed for production of sporangia and chlamydospores, the infectious and resistant propagules, respectively. P. ramorum was capable of infecting every species in our study and almost all species produced spores to some extent. Sporangia production was greatest in N. densiflorus and U. californica and the difference was insignificant. Even though other species produced much less, quantities were nonzero. Thus, additional species may play a previously unrecognized role in local transmission. Chlamydospore production was highest in Acer macrophyllum and Ceanothus oliganthus, raising questions about the role they play in pathogen persistence. Lesion size did not consistently correlate with the production of either sporangia or chlamydospores. Overall, we achieved an empirical foundation to better understand how community composition affects transmission of P. ramorum.  aPublisher supplied data  a1650042cNational Science Foundation  cJastro Graduate Research Award  cUC Davis Ecology Block Grant Fellowship  cUSDA Forest Service, Forest Health Protection 3aAcer macrophyllum 3aCeanothus 3aNotholithocarpus densiflorus 3aPhytophthora ramorum 3aUmbellularia californica 3achlamydospores 3acoasts 3apathogen survival 3apathogens 3arisk 3asporangia 3asporulation 3asudden oak death 3aCalifornia 0acompetency 0aleaf dip assay 0aleaf disc assay 0atransmission potential1 aFajardo, Sebastian N.1 aRizzo, David M.0 tPlant disease.g2021 Aug. 20, v. 105, no. 8 p.2209-2216dThe American Phytopathological SocietywJournal:jnl30858x0191-29177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1094/PDIS-03-20-0485-RE3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03332naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245014400172300001800316520189300334592002802227650000902255650001002264650002802274650001202302650002202314650002602336650001202362650001302374650002302387650002402410650001202434650001002446650001402456651001802470653001202488653000802500653002802508653001702536653001602553653001602569653002802585700002502613773011802638856008502756852000902841655001202850IND60625545120221119022901.0210105e20190115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062554512DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foreco.2018.10.0432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGreenler, Skye M.10aShort-term, spatial regeneration patterns following expanding group shelterwood harvests and prescribed fire in the Central Hardwood Region  ap. 1053-1063.  aThroughout eastern North America, oaks (Quercus) are a foundational tree species, but are regenerating poorly, particularly on mesic sites. This regeneration failure has spurred development of new management practices that create heterogeneous regeneration conditions that better match oak‚Äôs response to disturbances such as surface fire and windthrow. Expanding group shelterwood systems are designed to produce diverse regeneration conditions and have a high edge-to-forest interior ratio, where intermediate light levels may be beneficial for oak regeneration. We present data on early regeneration patterns from a large-scale experiment designed to assess the combined effects of these silvicultural systems and prescribed fire on oak regeneration, ecosystem resilience, and spatial and compositional heterogeneity in the Central Hardwood Region. Using transect-based surveys, we investigated the spatial patterns of woody regeneration within and outside of burned and unburned 2- or 3-stage group shelterwoods in factorial replicates at two different sites. Two years following the initial harvest, the south-facing site had substantial competitive oak regeneration just outside of the harvested groups on the northern, eastern, and western sides, but the east-facing site did not. On a stand level, tulip poplar (Liriodendron tulipifera) and sassafras (Sassafras albidum) regeneration increased in both sites, oak increased in the south-facing site, hickory (Carya) increased in the east-facing site, and maple (Acer) was relatively unaffected by the treatments. Competitive oak regeneration in the forest matrix just outside of the harvested groups in the south-facing site holds promise to regenerate a stand with a substantial oak component and high overall diversity, given the shelterwood groups will be expanded outward in successive entries and burned repeatedly over time.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcer 3aCarya 3aLiriodendron tulipifera 3aQuercus 3aSassafras albidum 3aecological resilience 3aforests 3ahardwood 3aprescribed burning 3ashelterwood systems 3asurveys 3atrees 3awindthrow 3aNorth America 0aQuercus 0aOak 0aBayerischer Femelschlag 0aEdge effects 0aCanopy gaps 0aMesic sites 0aCentral Hardwood Forest1 aSaunders, Michael R.0 tForest ecology and management.g2019 Jan. 15, v. 432 p.1053-1063dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl9013x0378-11277nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2018.10.0433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02626naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100006100153245015100214300001600365520100200381592002801383650002101411650001401432650002301446650001201469650001201481650001301493650001101506650002901517650000901546650001101555650001401566650001201580650001101592650001301603650001001616650001501626650001401641650002701655650002001682650000901702651002201711653002101733653001701754653001801771653001501789653002201804653001101826700003201837773010601869856008801975852000902063655001202072IND60597137720221118234816.0190705e201806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059713772DNAL7 a10.1016/j.marpolbul.2018.04.0392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBonanno, Giuseppe1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3872-700510aComparative assessment of trace element accumulation and bioindication in seagrasses Posidonia oceanica, Cymodocea nodosa and Halophila stipulacea  ap. 260-266.  aAccumulation and bioindication of trace elements were compared in three seagrasses growing in the Mediterranean Sea: Posidonia oceanica, Cymodocea nodosa and Halophila stipulacea. The levels of the elements As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Hg, Mn, Ni, Pb and Zn were investigated in water, sediments, and roots, rhizomes and leaves of seagrasses. Results showed that seagrasses can accumulate comparable levels of trace elements, but P. oceanica and C. nodosa showed higher mean values of element accumulation. Moreover, P. oceanica and C. nodosa may accumulate high element concentrations in their leaves, whereas in H. stipulacea restricted with the bulk of trace elements in roots and rhizomes. Seagrasses reflected to a different degree the levels of several trace elements in sediments, especially P. oceanica and C. nodosa, whose use as bioindicators is recommended. The future step for an effective use of seagrasses as bioindicators of marine pollution is to set up biomonitoring networks on a large scale.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCymodocea nodosa 3aHalophila 3aPosidonia oceanica 3aarsenic 3acadmium 3achromium 3acopper 3aenvironmental monitoring 3alead 3aleaves 3amanganese 3amercury 3anickel 3arhizomes 3aroots 3aseagrasses 3asediments 3asodium dodecyl sulfate 3awater pollution 3azinc 3aMediterranean Sea 0aMarine pollution 0aHeavy metals 0aBiomonitoring 0aSeagrasses 0aMediterranean Sea 0aSicily1 aRaccuia, Salvatore Antonino0 tMarine pollution bulletin.g2018 June, v. 131 p.260-266dElsevier LtdwJournal:12420x0025-326X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.marpolbul.2018.04.0393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03122naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094024002200122024001900144040001800163100001900181245005900200300001800259500002000277506007600297520172700373592002802100506003702128650002302165650002802188650002202216650000902238650001002247650001902257650001102276650002002287650001202307650001502319650001402334700001602348700001802364700001402382700001602396700001602412773014102428856007402569852000902643655001202652IND60587429020221207140145.0180102e201707  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058742902DNAL7 a10.1111/jvim.147292doi7 aPMC55083212pmcid7 a285140492pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBoostrom, B.O.10aCanine Cutaneous Plasmacytosis: 21 Cases (2005‚Äì2015)  ap. 1074-1080.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Cutaneous plasmacytosis (CP) is a syndrome of multiple cutaneous plasma cell tumors, in the absence of multiple myeloma. Although rare in both humans and dogs, treatment recommendations are usually extrapolated from multiple myeloma protocols. To date, no case series of CP have been described in the veterinary literature. HYPOTHESIS/OBJECTIVES: To describe clinical presentation, determine treatment response rates and duration, and report overall survival of dogs with CP. ANIMALS: Twenty‚Äêone client‚Äêowned dogs with CP. METHODS: Medical records of 21 dogs with CP were reviewed. Diagnosis was based on histopathologic evaluation of at least 1 representative cutaneous or subcutaneous lesion in dogs with ‚â•3 lesions. Dogs with suspicion of multiple myeloma were excluded. RESULTS: The most commonly affected breeds were the golden (5/21) and Labrador retriever (3/21). Fourteen of 21 dogs had >10 lesions, with some having >100. Lesions commonly were described as round, raised, pink‚Äêto‚Äêred, and variably alopecic or ulcerated. The most commonly used drug protocol was combined melphalan and prednisone, with an overall response rate (ORR) of 73.7% (14/19 dogs). Single‚Äêagent lomustine was associated with a similar ORR of 71.4% (5/7 dogs). For all treatments combined, the median progression‚Äêfree interval after the first treatment was 153 days. The median survival time from the first treatment was 542 days. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: Alkylating agents were effective in inducing remission of CP; corticosteroids, melphalan, and lomustine were the most commonly used drugs. Survival times were similar to those reported in dogs with multiple myeloma treated with alkylating agents.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aLabrador Retriever 3aadrenal cortex hormones 3aalkylation agents 3adogs 3adrugs 3ahistopathology 3ahumans 3amedical records 3amyeloma 3aprednisone 3aremission1 aMoore, A.S.1 aDeRegis, C.J.1 aRobat, C.1 aFreeman, K.1 aThamm, D.H.0 tJournal of veterinary internal medicine.g2017 July, v. 31, no. 4 p.1074-1080dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl43440x0891-66407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jvim.147293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03982naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001800145245016100163300001800324520218600342592002802528650001002556650001102566650001902577650001402596650002102610650002002631650002202651650001702673650001202690650001702702650001302719650001902732650002702751650001102778650002002789650002502809650001102834650001602845650002502861650001102886651002802897651001002925653001502935653001902950653002202969653001502991653002703006700002303033700002203056700002303078700002103101700001903122700001803141773012103159856007903280852000903359655001203368IND60674344820221118111001.0191025e20180322xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067434482DNAL7 a10.1093/treephys/tpy0252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRezaie, Negar10aDo atmospheric CO‚ÇÇ concentration increase, climate and forest management affect iWUE of common beech? Evidences from carbon isotope analyses in tree rings  ap. 1110-1126.  aBeech is one of the most important forest tree species in Europe, hence possible adverse factors affecting its physiology and productivity can have strong ecological and economic impacts. In this context, four beech forests along a latitudinal gradient from southern Apennines to middle European lowlands were selected for chronological determinations of carbon isotope composition (Œ¥¬π¬≥C) in tree-ring cellulose. The main objectives of this study were to assess (i) the effect of climate on the carbon signature of tree-ring cellulose (Œ¥¬π¬≥C); (ii) the physiological response to recent CO‚ÇÇ concentration increment and to climatic variation; and (iii) the relationship between intrinsic water-use efficiency (iWUE, here the average long-term ratio of net photosynthesis to stomatal conductance) and growth of trees in different sites since 1950. Our results demonstrated that site climatic conditions peculiarly affect Œ¥¬π¬≥C. In northern sites, a climatic control of summer precipitation and temperature on stomatal conductance was demonstrated by their opposite correlations with Œ¥¬π¬≥C, negative and positive, respectively. Furthermore, an ‚Äòearliness effect‚Äô was suggested by a significant relationship between spring temperature and Œ¥¬π¬≥C in the coldest sites and by a positive one between winter temperature and Œ¥¬π¬≥C in the warmest ones. In all the study sites, during the maturity phase, a positive correlation between the increment of CO‚ÇÇ and iWUE was observed, due to an active response of trees to CO‚ÇÇ increment. This increment of CO‚ÇÇ was the main driver of the long term increasing trend of iWUE, resulting by an active response of trees to CO‚ÇÇ fertilization. Moreover, precipitation mostly influences positively and negatively the inter-annual variations of iWUE of the southernmost and northernmost sites, respectively. Overall, we observed a mean increment of 40% of iWUE. Moreover, the sensitivity of iWUE to the increase of CO‚ÇÇ was different between the northernmost and southernmost sites. Increasing iWUE was correlated to growth in the two sites during the release phase and we hypothesize a positive effect of silvicultural treatments.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFagus 3acarbon 3acarbon dioxide 3acellulose 3aclimatic factors 3aeconomic impact 3aforest management 3aforest trees 3aforests 3agrowth rings 3alowlands 3aphotosynthesis 3aphysiological response 3aspring 3astable isotopes 3astomatal conductance 3asummer 3atemperature 3awater use efficiency 3awinter 3aCentral European region 3aItaly 0aadaptation 0aclimate change 0aFagus sylvatica L 0amitigation 0astable carbon isotopes1 aD‚ÄôAndrea, Ettore1 aBr√§uning, Achim,1 aMatteucci, Giorgio1 aBombi, Pierluigi1 aLauteri, Marco1 aEpron, Daniel0 tTree physiology.g2018 Mar. 22, v. 38, no. 8 p.1110-1126dOxford University PresswJournal:jnl41003x1758-44697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/treephys/tpy0253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02114naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002100155245008800176300001300264520103000277592002801307650002101335650002401356650001501380650001101395653002301406653002701429653002901456653002601485700002301511700002301534700002201557773008701579856008901666852000901755655001201764IND60605082520221122054658.0180720e201504  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060508252DNAL7 a10.1016/j.compositesa.2015.01.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVertuccio, Luigi10aStrain and damage monitoring in carbon-nanotube-based composite under cyclic strain  ap. 9-16.  aThe resistive behavior of multi-walled carbon nanotube (MWCNT)/epoxy resins, tested under mechanical cycles and different levels of applied strain, was investigated for specimens loaded in axial tension. The surface normalized resistivity is linear with the strain for volume fraction of MWCNTs between 2.96√ó10‚Åª‚Å¥ and 2.97√ó10‚Åª¬≥ (0.05 and 0.5% wt/wt). For values lower than 0.05% wt/wt, close to the electrical percolation threshold (EPT) a non-linear behavior was observed. The strain sensitivity, in the range between 0.67 and 4.45, may be specifically modified by controlling the nanotube loading, in fact the sensor sensitivity decreases with increasing the carbon nanotubes amount. Microscale damages resulted directly related to the resistance changes and hence easily detectable in a non-destructive way by means of electrical measurements. In the fatigue tests, the damage is expressed through the presence of a residual resistivity, which increases with the amount of plastic strain accumulated in the matrix.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon nanotubes 3acomposite materials 3amonitoring 3aresins 0aA.

OBJECTIVES: To define clinical features of paroxysmal dyskinesia (PD) in a large number of Border Terriers and to study the genetics of the disease. ANIMALS: 110 affected and 128 unaffected client‚Äêowned Border Terriers. METHODS: A questionnaire regarding clinical characteristics of PD was designed at Utrecht University and the University of Helsinki. Thirty‚Äêfive affected Border Terriers underwent physical examination and blood testing (hematology and clinical biochemistry). Diagnostic imaging of the brain was performed in 17 affected dogs and electroencephalograms (EEG) between episodes were obtained in 10 affected dogs. A genomewide association study (GWAS) was performed with DNA of 110 affected and 128 unaffected dogs. RESULTS: One hundred forty‚Äêseven questionnaires were included in the study. The most characteristic signs during episodes were dystonia, muscle fasciculations, and falling over. The majority of owners believed that their dogs remained conscious during the episodes. A beneficial effect of anti‚Äêepileptic therapy was observed in 29 of 43 dogs. Fifteen owners changed their dogs‚Äô diet to a hypoallergenic, gluten‚Äêfree diet, and all reported reasonable to good improvement of signs. Clinical examinations and diagnostic test results were unremarkable. The GWAS did not identify significantly associated chromosome regions. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: The survey results and EEG studies provided further evidence that the observed syndrome is a PD rather than epilepsy. Failure to achieve conclusive results by GWAS indicates that inheritance of PD in Border Terriers probably is complex.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDNA 3abrain 3achromosomes 3aclinical examination 3adogs 3adyskinesia 3aelectroencephalography 3aepilepsy 3agluten-free diet 3ahematology 3aimage analysis 3amuscles 3aquestionnaires 3asurveys 3aterriers 3atherapeutics 3aNetherlands1 aKoskinen, L.L.E.1 avan Steenbeek, F.G.1 aSepp√§l√§, E.H.1 aJokinen, T.S.1 aPrins, P.G.M.1 aBok, H.G.J.1 aZandvliet, M.M.J.M.1 aVos‚ÄêLoohuis, M.1 aLeegwater, P.A.J.1 aLohi, H.0 tJournal of veterinary internal medicine.g2017 July, v. 31, no. 4 p.1123-1131dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl43440x0891-66407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jvim.147313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02909naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002800152245016000180300001800340520099500358592002801353650002101381650002701402650002701429650002601456650002301482650001401505650001301519650001901532650001201551650001501563650002101578650003701599650004401636650001801680653003201698653004001730653003701770653000801807653001901815653001801834653002101852653002701873653002601900653002701926700003801953700003101991700002902022700003002051700002702081700002502108773010202133856008702235852000902322655001202331IND60571019120221118031646.0190402e20171215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057101912DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2017.06.0562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aResende, D√©borah Braga10aSynthesis and in vitro evaluation of peracetyl and deacetyl glycosides of eugenol, isoeugenol and dihydroeugenol acting against food-contaminating bacteria  ap. 1025-1029.  aEssential oils, as well as their separate components, have shown promise as alternatives to synthetic preservatives. Therefore, it would be interesting to optimize the effect of these compounds and to evaluate their applicability as additives in food. To this end, six peracetyl and deacetyl glycosides were synthesized from eugenol, isoeugenol and dihydroeugenol. All of the glycosides were characterized by IR and NMR. The synthesized compounds and their aglycones were evaluated to determine their minimal bactericidal concentrations (MBC) against the spoilage food bacteria Escherichia coli, Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus aureus and Salmonella enteritidis. All deacetyl glycosides were about twice as active as aglycones, and the peracetyl glycosides were, in most cases, equipotent with aglycones. The deacetyl glycoside of dihydroeugenol proved to be the most active compound against the bacteria tested, with a 0.37% MBC v/v for E. coli and 0.18% v/v for the other bacteria.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aListeria monocytogenes 3aSalmonella Enteritidis 3aStaphylococcus aureus 3aactive ingredients 3aadditives 3abacteria 3aessential oils 3aeugenol 3aglycosides 3ain vitro studies 3aminimum inhibitory concentration 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3apreservatives 0aEugenol (PubChem CID: 3314) 0aDihydroeugenol (PubChem CID: 17739) 0aIsoeugenol (PubChem CID: 853433) 0aNMR 0aEssential oils 0aGlycosylation 0aEscherichia coli 0aListeria monocytogenes 0aStaphylococcus aureus 0aSalmonella enteritidis1 aMartins, Helo√≠sa Helena de Abreu1 aSouza, Thiago Belarmino de1 aCarvalho, Diogo Teixeira1 aPiccoli, Roberta Hilsdorf1 aSchwan, Rosane Freitas1 aDias, Disney Ribeiro0 tFood chemistry.g2017 Dec. 15, v. 237 p.1025-1029dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8139x0308-81467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2017.06.0563Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03061naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094024002200122024001900144040001800163100001500181245007600196300001600272500001100288506007600299520174700375592002802122506003702150650000902187650001002196650002002206650001502226650001102241650002302252650001202275650001302287650001102300650001402311650001302325650002002338650002002358700001502378773013902393856007402532852000902606655001202615IND60587429320221207140150.0180102e201707  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058742932DNAL7 a10.1111/jvim.147712doi7 aPMC55083442pmcid7 a285570612pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLowrie, M.10aClassification of Involuntary Movements in Dogs: Myoclonus and Myotonia  ap. 979-987.  aREVIEW  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aMyoclonus is a sudden brief, involuntary muscle jerk. Of all the movement disorders, myoclonus is the most difficult to encapsulate into any simple framework. On the one hand, a classification system is required that is clinically useful to aid in guiding diagnosis and treatment. On the other hand, there is need for a system that organizes current knowledge regarding biological mechanisms to guide scientific research. These 2 needs are distinct, making it challenging to develop a robust classification system suitable for all purposes. We attempt to classify myoclonus as ‚Äúepileptic‚Äù and ‚Äúnonepileptic‚Äù based on its association with epileptic seizures. Myotonia in people may be divided into 2 clinically and molecularly defined forms: (1) nondystrophic myotonias and (2) myotonic dystrophies. The former are a group of skeletal muscle channelopathies characterized by delayed skeletal muscle relaxation. Many distinct clinical phenotypes are recognized in people, the majority relating to mutations in skeletal muscle voltage‚Äêgated chloride (CLCN1) and sodium channel (SCN4A) genes. In dogs, myotonia is associated with mutations in CLCN1. The myotonic dystrophies are considered a multisystem clinical syndrome in people encompassing 2 clinically and molecularly defined forms designated myotonic dystrophy types 1 and 2. No mutation has been linked to veterinary muscular dystrophies. We detail veterinary examples of myotonia and attempt classification according to guidelines used in humans. This more precise categorization of myoclonus and myotonia aims to promote the search for molecular markers contributing to the phenotypic spectrum of disease. Our work aimed to assist recognition for these 2 enigmatic conditions.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3adogs 3agenes 3agenetic markers 3aguidelines 3ahumans 3amovement disorders 3amuscles 3amutation 3apeople 3aphenotype 3aseizures 3askeletal muscle 3asodium channels1 aGarosi, L.0 tJournal of veterinary internal medicine.g2017 July, v. 31, no. 4 p.979-987dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl43440x0891-66407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jvim.147713Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02639naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001400148245011900162300001600281520105700297592002801354650000801382650002001390650001301410650001601423650002001439650001401459650003001473650002201503650002901525653000701554653000901561653000801570653000901578653000801587653001001595653001301605653002001618653001001638653002701648653002901675700001901704700001901723700001701742700001601759700001801775700001301793700001801806700001801824700001901842773012101861856008201982852000902064655001202073IND60089731120221119142027.0160728e20130419xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008973112DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbrc.2012.12.0402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLin, Jing10aStabilization of G-quadruplex DNA by C-5-methyl-cytosine in bcl-2 promoter: Implications for epigenetic regulation  ap. 368-373.  aThe C-5-methylation of cytosine in the CpG islands is an important pattern for epigenetic modification of gene, which plays a key role in regulating gene transcription. G-quadruplex is an unusual DNA secondary structure formed in G-rich regions and is identified as a transcription repressor in some oncogenes, such as c-myc and bcl-2. In the present study, the results from CD spectrum and FRET assay showed that the methylation of cytosine in the CpG islands could induce a conformational change of the G-quadruplex in the P1 promoter of bcl-2, and greatly increase the thermal-stability of this DNA oligomer. Moreover, the methylation of cytosine in the G-quadruplex could protect the structure from the disruption by the complementary strand, showing with the increasing ability to arrest the polymerase in PCR stop assay. This data indicated that the stabilization of the G-quadruplex structure in the CpG islands might be involved in the epigenetical transcriptional regulation for specific genes through the C-5-methylation modification pattern.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aDNA methylation 3acytosine 3aepigenetics 3agenomic islands 3aoncogenes 3apolymerase chain reaction 3athermal stability 3atranscription (genetics) 0aCD 0aFRET 0aPCR 0aRMSD 0aFAM 0aTAMRA 0aCytosine 0aDNA methylation 0aBcl-2 0aG-quadruplex stability 0aTranscription regulation1 aHou, Jin-qiang1 aXiang, Han-dan1 aYan, Yi-yong1 aGu, Yu-chao1 aTan, Jia-heng1 aLi, Ding1 aGu, Lian-quan1 aOu, Tian-miao1 aHuang, Zhi-shu0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2013 Apr. 19, v. 433 p.368-373dElsevier Inc.x0006-291X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2012.12.0403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02928naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245009500166300001800261520148200279592002801761650002201789650002201811650001601833650002101849650002801870650001601898650002001914650001801934650001601952650002001968650002101988650002102009650000702030650001302037650002402050650001102074650001602085650002102101650001802122651001002140700003102150700001902181700002702200773011702227856008102344852000902425655001202434IND60440622620221120061431.0151024e201509  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6044062262DNAL7 a10.1007/s12665-015-4450-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNemati, Samira10aEstimation of dissolved oxygen using data-driven techniques in the Tai Po River, Hong Kong  ap. 4065-4073.  aThis study investigates the applicability of multilinear regression (MLR), adaptive neural-based fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) and artificial neural networks (ANN) methods from data-driven techniques in estimation of the dissolved oxygen (DO), which is an important parameter in water quality, aquatic life, efficient water management and health care planning studies. The measured parameters covering 21¬†years of sample data for the years 1991‚Äì2011 in the Tai Po River, Hong Kong, were used to develop the models. The input parameters used to estimate DO are chloride (Cl), pH value (pH), electrical conductivity, temperature (Temp), nitrite nitrogen (NO‚ÇÇ-N), nitrate nitrogen (NO‚ÇÉ-N), ammonia nitrogen (NH‚ÇÑ-N) and total phosphorous (T-P). The performance of the developed models was evaluated through the three performance criteria: correlation coefficient, root mean square error and the Nash‚ÄìSutcliffe efficiency coefficient. When the results of the developed models were compared with DO measurements using performance criteria, the ANN model shows better performance than the MLR and ANFIS models in estimation of DO concentration. Also, a sensitivity analysis was carried out to evaluate the relative importance of the input parameters in estimation of the DO. The most effective input parameters are determined as Cl, Temp, NO‚ÇÉ-N, NO‚ÇÇ-N, NH‚ÇÑ-N and T-P parameters, respectively. Furthermore, the pH variable has the least contribution on the ANN model.  aPublisher supplied data 3aammonium nitrogen 3aaquatic organisms 3acorrelation 3adissolved oxygen 3aelectrical conductivity 3afuzzy logic 3ahealth services 3alinear models 3amethodology 3aneural networks 3anitrate nitrogen 3anitrite nitrogen 3apH 3aplanning 3aregression analysis 3arivers 3atemperature 3awater management 3awater quality 3aChina1 aFazelifard, Mohammad Hasan1 aTerzi, √ñzlem,1 aGhorbani, Mohammad Ali0 tEnvironmental earth sciences.g2015 Sept., v. 74, no. 5 p.4065-4073dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx1866-62807nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12665-015-4450-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03823naa a2200709 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245012200169300001600291500001400307520164400321592002801965650001101993650000902004650001502013650001802028650001902046650001602065650002002081650001602101650002802117650001402145650001902159650001802178650004102196650001802237650001502255650001802270650002102288650001402309650001902323653003102342653001902373653002102392653002402413653000902437653000902446653000802455653000702463653000802470653001002478653000802488653001702496700001402513700001502527700002002542700001402562700001602576700001202592700001602604700001402620700001502634700001702649773034102666856008503007852000903092655001203101IND60713997020221119053031.0210219e20210208xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071399702DNAL7 a10.1016/j.numecd.2020.09.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiao, Yue-Yuan10aLong-term burden of higher body mass index from childhood on adult cardiometabolic biomarkers: A 30-year cohort study  ap. 439-447.  aNAL-light  aData are limited regarding the association between long-term burden of higher body mass index (BMI) from childhood and cardiometabolic biomarkers.A total of 1553 individuals aged 6‚Äì15 years, who were examined 4 or more times for BMI since childhood and followed for 30 years were included in our analysis. Total area under the curve (AUCt) and incremental AUC (AUCi) were calculated as the long-term burden and trends of BMI. Cardiometabolic biomarkers including serum uric acid (SUA), fasting blood-glucose (FBG), and triglyceride to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio (TG/HDL-C) were obtained from venous blood samples. The results showed a positive association of BMI AUCt and AUCi with cardiometabolic biomarkers. After adjusting for demographic variables, the AUCt and AUCi of BMI were significantly associated with a higher level of SUA (Œ≤¬†=¬†3.71; 2.87), FBG (Œ≤¬†=¬†0.09; 0.09), and TG/HDL-C (Œ≤¬†=¬†0.14; 0.11). We performed further studies after dividing subjects into four groups according to AUCt and AUCi of BMI by quartiles. Compared with the lowest quartile group, the highest quartile group had significantly increased risk ratios of hyperuricemia (RR¬†=¬†2.01; 1.74), type 2 diabetes mellitus (RR¬†=¬†8.18; 3.96), and high-risk TG/HDL-C (RR¬†=¬†4.05; 3.26).Our study identifies all subjects‚Äô BMI growth curve from childhood and indicates that the long-term burden of higher BMI significantly increases the cardiometabolic risk, and the impact of excessive body weight on cardiometabolic health originates in early life. We emphasize the importance of weight control from childhood for cardiometabolic health.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadults 3aarea 3abiomarkers 3ablood glucose 3ablood sampling 3ablood serum 3abody mass index 3abody weight 3acardiovascular diseases 3achildhood 3acohort studies 3agrowth curves 3ahigh density lipoprotein cholesterol 3ahyperuricemia 3ametabolism 3arelative risk 3atriacylglycerols 3auric acid 3aweight control 0aCardiometabolic biomarkers 0aChild-to-adult 0aLong-term burden 0aLongitudinal cohort 0aAUCt 0aAUCi 0aBMI 0aBP 0aFBG 0aLDL-C 0aSUA 0aand TG/HDL-C1 aChu, Chao1 aWang, Yang1 aZheng, Wen-Ling1 aMa, Qiong1 aHu, Jia-Wen1 aYan, Yu1 aWang, Ke-Ke1 aYuan, Yue1 aChen, Chen1 aMu, Jian-Jun0 tNutrition, metabolism, and cardiovascular diseases.g2021 Feb. 08, v. 31, no. 2 p.439-447dElsevier B.V.aThe Italian Diabetes Society, the Italian Society for the Study of Atherosclerosis, the Italian Society of Human Nutrition and the Department of Clinical Medicine and Surgery, Federico II UniversitywJournal:11953x0939-47537nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.numecd.2020.09.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03776naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094024002200121024001900143040001800162100001900180245010000199300001800299506007600317520221400393592002802607506003702635650002202672650001702694650002002711650001202731650002202743650004402765650002502809650001702834650001102851650002002862650001102882700001802893700001902911700001902930700001902949700002702968700002502995700002003020700002003040700002303060773010303083856007503186852000903261655001203270IND60531022720221207133445.0160723e20121211xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053102272DNAL7 a10.1021/bi301256s2doi7 aPMC41316872pmcid7 a231675642pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKhoo, Keith
K.10aDistinct Disulfide Isomers of Œº-Conotoxins KIIIA and KIIIB Block Voltage-Gated Sodium Channels  ap. 9826-9835.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aIn the preparation of synthetic conotoxins containing multiple disulfide bonds, oxidative folding can produce numerous permutations of disulfide bond connectivities. Establishing the native disulfide connectivities thus presents a significant challenge when the venom-derived peptide is not available, as is increasingly the case when conotoxins are identified from cDNA sequences. Here, we investigate the disulfide connectivity of Œº-conotoxin KIIIA, which was predicted originally to have a [C1‚ÄìC9,C2‚ÄìC15,C4‚ÄìC16] disulfide pattern based on homology with closely related Œº-conotoxins. The two major isomers of synthetic Œº-KIIIA formed during oxidative folding were purified and their disulfide connectivities mapped by direct mass spectrometric collision-induced dissociation fragmentation of the disulfide-bonded polypeptides. Our results show that the major oxidative folding product adopts a [C1‚ÄìC15,C2‚ÄìC9,C4‚ÄìC16] disulfide connectivity, while the minor product adopts a [C1‚ÄìC16,C2‚ÄìC9,C4‚ÄìC15] connectivity. Both of these peptides were potent blockers of NaV1.2 (Kd values of 5 and 230 nM, respectively). The solution structure for Œº-KIIIA based on nuclear magnetic resonance data was recalculated with the [C1‚ÄìC15,C2‚ÄìC9,C4‚ÄìC16] disulfide pattern; its structure was very similar to the Œº-KIIIA structure calculated with the incorrect [C1‚ÄìC9,C2‚ÄìC15,C4‚ÄìC16] disulfide pattern, with an Œ±-helix spanning residues 7‚Äì12. In addition, the major folding isomers of Œº-KIIIB, an N-terminally extended isoform of Œº-KIIIA identified from its cDNA sequence, were isolated. These folding products had the same disulfide connectivities as Œº-KIIIA, and both blocked NaV1.2 (Kd values of 470 and 26 nM, respectively). Our results establish that the preferred disulfide pattern of synthetic Œº-KIIIA and Œº-KIIIB folded in vitro is 1‚Äì5/2‚Äì4/3‚Äì6 but that other disulfide isomers are also potent sodium channel blockers. These findings raise questions about the disulfide pattern(s) of Œº-KIIIA in the venom of Conus kinoshitai; indeed, the presence of multiple disulfide isomers in the venom could provide a means of further expanding the snail‚Äôs repertoire of active peptides.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acomplementary DNA 3adissociation 3adisulfide bonds 3aisomers 3amass spectrometry 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3anucleotide sequences 3apolypeptides 3asnails 3asodium channels 3avenoms1 aGupta, Kallol1 aGreen, Brad R.1 aZhang, Min-Min1 aWatkins, Maren1 aOlivera, Baldomero M.,1 aBalaram, Padmanabhan1 aYoshikami, Doju1 aBulaj, Grzegorz1 aNorton, Raymond S.0 tBiochemistry.g2012 Dec. 11, v. 51, no. 49 p.9826-9835dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-49957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fbi301256s3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02961naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245012600168300001600294520157600310592002801886650001601914650001101930650001401941650001801955650002101973650001701994650001102011650001902022650001802041650001102059650001302070650001702083650001902100650001602119650002702135700002002162700002802182700002002210700002102230700002202251700002802273773010002301856008102401852000902482655001202491IND60572717020221122220251.0170717e201704  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057271702DNAL7 a10.1134/S10642293170200892doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLarionova, A. A.10aEffect of temperature and moisture on the mineralization and humification of leaf litter in a model incubation experiment  ap. 422-431.  aThe mineralization and humification of leaf litter collected in a mixed forest of the Prioksko-Terrasny Reserve depending on temperature (2, 12, and 22¬∞C) and moisture (15, 30, 70, 100, and 150% of water holding capacity (WHC)) has been studied in long-term incubation experiments. Mineralization is the most sensitive to temperature changes at the early stage of decomposition; the Q ‚ÇÅ‚ÇÄ value at the beginning of the experiment (1.5‚Äì2.7) is higher than at the later decomposition stages (0.3‚Äì1.3). Carbon losses usually exceed nitrogen losses during decomposition. Intensive nitrogen losses are observed only at the high temperature and moisture of litter (22¬∞C and 100% WHC). Humification determined from the accumulation of humic substances in the end of incubation decreases from 34 to 9% with increasing moisture and temperature. The degree of humification CHA/CFA is maximum (1.14) at 12¬∞C and 15% WHC; therefore, these temperature and moisture conditions are considered optimal for humification. Humification calculated from the limit value of litter mineralization is almost independent of temperature, but it significantly decreases from 70 to 3% with increasing moisture. A possible reason for the difference between the humification values measured by two methods is the conservation of a significant part of hemicelluloses, cellulose, and lignin during the transformation of litter and the formation of a complex of humic substances with plant residues, where HSs fulfill a protectoral role and decrease the decomposition rate of plant biopolymers.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiopolymers 3acarbon 3acellulose 3ahemicellulose 3ahumic substances 3ahumification 3alignin 3amineralization 3amixed forests 3amodels 3anitrogen 3aplant litter 3aplant residues 3atemperature 3awater holding capacity1 aMaltseva, A.

However, little is known about the joint effects of water stress, molybdenum, and cultivar on physiological traits of field-grown common bean. Therefore, a split-plot factorial design was used to determine the main and interaction effects of Water stress (3 levels: 55‚Äì60, 90‚Äì95 and 120‚Äì125‚Äâmm evaporation from class A pan), Molybdenum (2 levels: control and 80‚Äâg per ha), and Cultivar (2 levels: Akhtar and COS-16) on physiological traits and grain yield of common bean. The results indicated that leaf area index (LAI), chlorophyll index, relative water content (RWC) and grain yield decrease with increasing water stress. Spraying molybdenum to the plants increased LAI, RWC, and grain yield, but the extent of the increase varied with cultivar. The positive effect of molybdenum also varied with the magnitude of water stress, and it was higher in severe water stress condition compared to that in normal irrigation and moderate water stress conditions. Of the two cultivars, COS-16 gave significantly higher grain yield than Akhtar cultivar, but Akhtar was superior in terms of physiological traits. The study demonstrated that the application of Molybdenum under water stress may cause an increase in N uptake and the efficiency of its use, that consequently increases the chlorophyll index and grain yield of common bean cultivars.  aPublisher supplied data 3abeans 3achlorophyll 3acultivars 3aevaporation 3agrain yield 3airrigation 3aleaf area index 3amolybdenum 3aplant growth 3aplant nutrition 3awater content 3awater stress 0acommon bean 0aphysiological characteristics1 aAsgari Lajayer, Behnam1 aShakiba, Mohammad Reza1 aAstatkie, Tess0 tJournal of plant nutrition.g2021 Feb. 7, v. 44, no. 3 p.366-372dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl43215x1532-40877nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01904167.2020.18223953Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02255naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001800146245012100164300002000285500001900305520103600324592002801360650002201388650001501410650001401425650001701439650001901456650001601475650001901491700001801510700001601528700002101544700006601565773017301631856008001804852000901884655001201893IND60711360120221116163035.0200923e20200828xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071136012DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.iecr.0c032602doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSaad, Anthony10aThermoresponsive PNIPAm‚ÄìPMMA-Functionalized PVDF Membranes with Reactive Fe‚ÄìPd Nanoparticles for PCB Degradation  ap. 16614-16625.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aFe‚ÄìPd nanoparticles are immobilized in stimuli-responsive poly-N-isopropylacrylamide (PNIPAm)- and poly-methyl methacrylate-functionalized polyvinylidene fluoride membranes using ion exchange for 2-chlorobiphenyl (PCB-1) degradation via the reductive pathway. PNIPAm is introduced into the reactive membrane system, and its thermoresponsive behavior is leveraged to enhance PCB-1 diffusion and adsorption into the reactive domain. The surface area-normalized rate constant (kSA) values were determined in the convective flow mode to be 0.13, 0.28, 0.72, and 1.36 L/m¬≤/g at 15, 25, 35, and 45 ¬∞C, respectively, with an activation energy of 60 kJ/mol (3 wt % Pd).

The adsorption of PCB-1 onto PNIPAm hydrogels also increased from 40 to 70% as the temperature was increased above its lower critical solution temperature of 32 ¬∞C.

In this study, we evaluated the protective capacity of chlorogenic acid (CGA) against sodium nitrite (NaNO‚ÇÇ‚Çé‚Äêinduced damage to rat erythrocytes. Two dosing regimens of CGA were undertaken to alleviate the erythrocyte injury induced by NaNO‚ÇÇ. We examined the cell fragility, the level of methemoglobin and oxidative stress parameters of each treated group. In result, as compared to the CGA post‚Äêincubation, co‚Äêincubation of CGA with NaNO‚ÇÇ decreased the content of advanced oxidation protein products. The protective capacity of CGA was superior to its remedial effect. We infer that the reaction of CGA and NaNO‚ÇÇ may suppress the cytotoxicity of nitrite on erythrocytes and avoid the generation of oxidative stress induced by NaNO‚ÇÇ. Our results suggest a novel diet strategy for preventing the adverse effects of nitrite in those people with exposure to nitrite. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Nitrite is ubiquitous in our environment and can also be formed from nitrogenous compounds by microorganisms which exist in the soil, water, and saliva. Several researches have been performed to explore the protection of natural products on the toxic effects of Nitrite. In this study, exogenous chlorogenic acid (CGA) is able to avert the membrane damage, lipid peroxidation, and morphology in nitrite‚Äêinduced erythrocytes. The protective capacity of CGA shows superior to the remediate effect of CGA against NaNO‚ÇÇ caused damage to erythrocytes. These results suggest a novel diet strategy for preventing the adverse effects of NaNO‚ÇÇ in those people with acute exposure to nitrite.  aPublisher supplied data  a31801453cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a2017ZD07cThe key program of the Foundation of Tianjin Educational Committee  aSKLFNS‚ÄêKF‚Äê201906cthe Open Project Program of State Key Laboratory of Food Nutrition and Safety, Tianjin University of Science & Technology  a2017M621059cChina Postdoctoral Science Foundation  a2018T110194cChina Postdoctoral Science Foundation 3aacute exposure 3aadvanced oxidation protein products 3aadverse effects 3achlorogenic acid 3acytotoxicity 3adiet 3aerythrocytes 3alipid peroxidation 3alipids 3amethemoglobinemia 3amicroorganisms 3amodels 3anitrogen compounds 3aoxidative stress 3asaliva 3asodium nitrite 3asoil1 aWang, Guangliang1 aWang, Xuerui1 aTang, Jinlei1 aLi, Chao0 tJournal of food biochemistry.g2020 May, v. 44, no. 5 p.e13172-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl8484x0145-88847nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jfbc.131723Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02783naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094024002200121024001900143040001800162100001600180245012300196300001800319506007600337520131900413592002801732506003701760650002101797650001001818650001201828650001901840650001901859650001201878650001301890650001101903650001701914650001501931650002201946650001701968700002201985700002302007700002302030700001702053700002102070700002302091773010302114856007502217852000902292655001202301IND60531022820221207133454.0160723e20121211xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053102282DNAL7 a10.1021/bi301323n2doi7 aPMC37111302pmcid7 a231709822pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJanco, Miro10aŒ±-Tropomyosin with a D175N or E180G Mutation in Only One Chain Differs from Tropomyosin with Mutations in Both Chains  ap. 9880-9890.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aŒ±-Tropomyosin (Tm) carrying hypertrophic cardiomyopathy mutation D175N or E180G was expressed in Escherichia coli. We have assembled dimers of two polypeptide chains in vitro that carry one (Œ±Œ±*) or two (Œ±*Œ±*) copies of the mutation. We found that the presence of the mutation has little effect on dimer assembly, thereby predicting that individuals heterozygous for the Tm mutations are likely to express both Œ±Œ±* and Œ±*Œ±* Tm. Depending on the expression level, the heterodimer may be the predominant form in individuals carrying the mutation. Thus, it is important to define differences in the properties of Tm molecules carrying one or two copies of the mutation. We examined the Tm homo- and heterodimer properties: actin affinity, thermal stability, calcium regulation of myosin subfragment 1 binding, and calcium regulation of myofibril force. We report that the properties of the heterodimer may be similar to those of the wild-type homodimer (actin affinity, thermal stability, D175N Œ±Œ±*), similar to those of the mutant homodimer (calcium sensitivity, D175N Œ±Œ±*), intermediate between the two (actin affinity, E180G Œ±Œ±*), or different from both (thermal stability, E180G Œ±Œ±*). Thus, the properties of the homodimer are not a completely reliable guide to the properties of the heterodimer.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aEscherichia coli 3aactin 3acalcium 3acardiomyopathy 3aheterozygosity 3amutants 3amutation 3amyosin 3apolypeptides 3aprediction 3athermal stability 3atropomyosins1 aKalyva, Athanasia1 aScellini, Beatrice1 aPiroddi, Nicoletta1 aTesi, Chiara1 aPoggesi, Corrado1 aGeeves, Michael A.0 tBiochemistry.g2012 Dec. 11, v. 51, no. 49 p.9880-9890dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-49957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fbi301323n3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02717naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002900152245018100181300001600362520106100378592002801439650004401467650002201511650001001533650002001543650001301563650001601576650001801592650000901610650001401619650000701633650003101640650002001671650001501691650001301706653001301719653001701732653002201749653002401771653002901795653002101824700002401845700002601869700002101895700002601916700002601942700002301968773010001991856008702091852000902178655001202187IND60542207320221118074412.0190402e20140615xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054220732DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2013.12.0672doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMangolim, Camila Sampaio10aCurcumin‚ÄìŒ≤-cyclodextrin inclusion complex: Stability, solubility, characterisation by FT-IR, FT-Raman, X-ray diffraction and photoacoustic spectroscopy, and food application  ap. 361-370.  aCurcumin was complexed with Œ≤-CD using co-precipitation, freeze-drying and solvent evaporation methods.

In addition, photoacoustic spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction, with the disappearance of the band related to aromatic rings, by Gaussian fitting, and modifications in the spectral lines, respectively, also suggested complex formation. The possible complexation had an efficiency of 74% and increased the solubility of the pure colourant 31-fold.

The retention of aroma compounds, constituting a model strawberry aroma, was evaluated by calculating gas-matrix partition coefficients using headspace gas chromatography (HS-GC).The retention capacity of WPA differed from the one of WPI for three out of seven aroma compounds detected in HS-GC. Incorporating WPA in fat-free yogurts tended to decrease the release of hydrophobic aroma compounds such as 2-nonanone or methyl-cinnamate. The magnitude of the differences between the partition coefficients of yogurts enriched in WPI or WPA was lower than in aqueous solutions, which is likely to be due to the higher complexity of the food matrix and potential interactions with other ingredients. Overall, the different aroma-retention capacities of native WPI and functional WPA are likely to lead to unbalanced aroma, especially in fat-free dairy products.  aPublisher supplied data 3afood matrix 3afood research 3agas chromatography 3aheadspace analysis 3ahydrophobicity 3aodors 3astrawberries 3awhey protein isolate 0aPartition coefficient 0aAroma release1 aAlleaume, Cl√©mence1 aBouhallab, Sa√Ød1 aFamelart, Marie-H√©l√®ne1 aMarzin, C√©cile1 aLopez-Torres, Lizeth1 aProst, Carole1 aRannou, C√©cile0 tFood research international.g2020 Oct., v. 136 p.109491-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl48420x0963-99697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodres.2020.1094913Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03082naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245013500172300001600307500001900323520164300342592002801985650002402013650001602037650001302053650001602066650000902082650001002091650001502101650002002116650001902136650001102155650001902166650002302185650002802208653001902236653001002255653002002265653001702285653002402302700001902326700002202345700001602367773012202383856008602505852000902591655001202600IND60719839220221118051753.0210312e20210207xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071983922DNAL7 a10.1080/01904167.2020.18223972doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMaharana, Rojali10aBiosolubilization of rock phosphate by Pleurotus ostreatus with brewery sludge and its effect on the growth of maize (Zea mays L.)  ap. 395-410.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aRock Phosphate (RP) is a natural phosphorus source which can be an alternative to chemical fertilizers; but unfortunately, we lack technologies to make it applicable in alkaline soils. Therefore the aim of this work was to study the effects of phosphorous solubilizing fungus Pleurotus ostreatus on rock phosphate solubilization and its effect on growth of Zea mays L. incorporated with brewery sludge. The activity of the selected strain indicates the formation of the halo zone supplemented with rock phosphate. The maximum concentration of soluble phosphorus (P) was found at the 9th day of incubation in Pikovskaya‚Äôs broth containing rock phosphate as P source. The inoculation of P. ostreatus with RP and brewery sludge significantly increased the root length (49%), shoot length (27%), root fresh weight (20%), root dry weight (46%), shoot fresh weight (89%), shoot dry weight (87%), chlorophyll content (79%) and nutrient accumulation, i.e., P (2.13), K (4.48), Ca (134.21), Mg (38.09), Cu (1.70), Mn (5.15), Zn (12.08), S (78.25) times greater than control in Zea mays L. The phosphatic residues after microbial solubilization showed structural and elemental changes confirmed by SEM and FE-SEM attached with energy-dispersive X-ray. The XRD and FTIR pattern shows that the mineral constituent of the treated sample signifies the proper P solubilization. Though few reports are available on P. ostreatus but biosolubilization with rock phosphate in the presence of brewery sludge is not yet reported. Overall, these findings suggest a possible application of the abundant waste materials on the sustainable growth of the plants.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPleurotus ostreatus 3aX-radiation 3aZea mays 3achlorophyll 3acorn 3afungi 3aphosphorus 3aplant nutrition 3arock phosphate 3asludge 3asolubilization 3asoluble phosphorus 3asustainable development 0abrewery sludge 0amaize 0anutrient uptake 0aplant growth 0arock phosphate (RP)1 aBasu, Aradhana1 aDhal, Nabin Kumar1 aAdak, Totan0 tJournal of plant nutrition.g2021 Feb. 7, v. 44, no. 3 p.395-410dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl43215x1532-40877nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01904167.2020.18223973Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03475naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100002000137245018600157300001800343500002000361520156300381592002801944596002901972596001702001596001902018596002502037596005202062650002302114650001102137650001002148650002102158650002402179650002002203650001402223650001402237650003002251650004302281650003002324700002102354700002302375700006002398700005602458700002202514700002002536700005702556700006302613700006102676773012702737856007202864852000902936655001202945IND60792051820221121093435.0220904e202210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079205182DNAL7 a10.1002/ps.70212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTadatsu, Misono12aA mutation in chitin synthase I associated with etoxazole resistance in the citrus red mite Panonychus citri (Acari: Tetranychidae) and its uneven geographical distribution in Japan  ap. 4028-4036.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aBACKGROUND: High‚Äêlevels of etoxazole resistance have not yet been frequently reported in Panonychus citri. Although a highly resistant strain was discovered in 2014, etoxazole resistance has not become a significant problem in areas of citrus production in Japan. A target site mutation in chitin synthase 1 (CHS1), I1017F, is a major etoxazole‚Äêresistance factor in Tetranychus urticae. To investigate the mechanisms of etoxazole resistance and the dispersal of resistance genes, we analyzed target‚Äêsite mutations in a highly resistant strain and their geographical distribution in Japan. RESULTS: High‚Äêlevel etoxazole resistance was completely recessive. The I1017F mutation was detected in CHS1 of the highly resistant strain, and its frequency was correlated with the hatchability of eggs treated with etoxazole. Sequencing and variant frequency analyses of local populations by quantitative polymerase chain reaction revealed that I1017F is restricted to the Ariake Sea area of Kyushu Island. Although a new nonsynonymous substitution, S1016L, accompanied by I1017F was found in CHS1 of the highly resistant strain, CRISPR/Cas9 engineering of flies showed that S1016L had no effect on the etoxazole resistance conferred by I1017F. CONCLUSION: I1017F is a major target site mutation that confers high‚Äêlevel etoxazole resistance on P.¬†citri. Dispersion of I1017F possibly was suppressed as a result of the completely recessive inheritance of resistance together with low gene flow between local populations. ¬© 2022 Society of Chemical Industry.  aPublisher supplied data  cEuropean Union's Horizon  cHorizon 2020  cEuropean Union  cthe Research Council  cHellenic Foundation for Research and Innovation 3aCRISPR-Cas systems 3aCitrus 3aJapan 3aPanonychus citri 3aTetranychus urticae 3achitin synthase 3aetoxazole 3agene flow 3ageographical distribution 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3asite-directed mutagenesis1 aSakashita, Ryota1 aPanteleri, Rafaela1 aDouris, Vassilis1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4608-74821 aVontas, John1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8704-25741 aShimotsuma, Yushi1 aIshida, Tatsuya1 aSudo, Masaaki1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9834-98571 aVan Leeuwen, Thomas1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4651-830X1 aOsakabe, Masahiro1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2246-34310 tPest management science.g2022 Oct., v. 78, no. 10 p.4028-4036dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.wJournal:jnl59519x1526-498X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ps.70213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02205naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004000111040001800151100001600169245006900185300001800254500001500272520096000287592002801247650001001275650001401285650001601299650001001315650001401325650001201339650001101351650001301362650001201375650002001387650001301407650001101420650002101431650001101452653001801463653001601481700001501497700001701512700001301529773009801542856008601640852000901726655001201735IND4466908320221119122009.0141110e201110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446690832DNAL7 a218035732pmid7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2011.07.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuang, Y.F.12aA sequential method to analyze the kinetics of biomass pyrolysis  ap. 9241-9246.  a2019-12-06  aThe kinetics of biomass pyrolysis was studied via a sequential method including two stages. Stage one is to analyze the kinetics of biomass pyrolysis and starts with the determination of unreacted fraction of sample at the maximum reaction rate, (1‚ÄìŒ±)‚Çò. Stage two provides a way to simulate the reaction rate profile and to verify the appropriateness of kinetic parameters calculated in the previous stage. Filter paper, xylan, and alkali lignin were used as representatives of cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin whose pyrolysis was analyzed with the assumption of the orders of reaction being 1, 2, and 3, respectively. For most of the biomass pyrolysis, kinetic parameters were properly determined and reaction rate profiles were adequately simulated by regarding the order of reaction as 1. This new method should be applicable to most of the biomass pyrolysis and similar reactions whose (1‚ÄìŒ±)‚Çò is acquirable, representative, and reliable.  aPublisher supplied data 3axylan 3acellulose 3amethodology 3apaper 3apyrolysis 3abiomass 3alignin 2aBiofuels 2aBiomass 2aHot Temperature 2aKinetics 2aLignin 2aModels, Chemical 2aXylans 0ahemicellulose 0anew methods1 aKuan, W.H.1 aChiueh, P.T.1 aLo, S.L.0 tBioresource technology.g2011 Oct., v. 102, no. 19 p.9241-9246dElsevier Ltdx0960-85247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2011.07.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02593naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245016300172300001600335500001900351520120000370592002801570650002701598650002301625650001201648650001201660650001301672650002401685650001701709650001301726650002001739650001401759650001501773650001001788653001501798653001901813653002801832653002101860700002201881700002701903773012201930856008602052852000902138655001202147IND60719839320221118051917.0210312e20210207xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071983932DNAL7 a10.1080/01904167.2020.18223982doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEtminani, Adibeh10aEffect of organic and inorganic amendments on growth indices and seed yield of red kidney bean (Phaseolus vulgaris) in competition with Amaranthus retroflexus  ap. 421-437.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aOrganic amendments have positive effects on growth indices and seed yield of red bean. They also affect the competition between crops and weeds. In order to investigate the effect of organic and inorganic amendments on the competitive ability of red beans with Amaranthus retroflexus, two experiments were conducted from 2017 to 2018. The experimental design was carried out using a split-plot arrangement with randomized complete block design (RCBD) in three replicates. The treatments included different types of fertilizer and redroot pigweed densities. Fertilizer and weed pressure treatments were determined as sub-plots and main plots, respectively. In a high and low competitive pressure of redroot pigweed, maximum to minimum seed yields were observed when using compost, manure, biochar, nitrogen and no-fertilizer treatments, respectively. Under a high and low competitive pressure of redroot pigweed, maximum to minimum amounts of weed biomass were obtained when using nitrogen, biochar, compost, manure and no-fertilizer treatments, respectively. It can be concluded that weed interference in red bean crop systems can be reduced by using organic amendments as a source of nutrients.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAmaranthus retroflexus 3aPhaseolus vulgaris 3abiochar 3abiomass 3acomposts 3aexperimental design 3akidney beans 3anitrogen 3aplant nutrition 3ared beans 3aseed yield 3aweeds 0afertilizer 0agrowth indices 0aredroot pigweed density 0aweed competition1 aMohammadi, Khosro1 aSaberali, Seyed Farhad0 tJournal of plant nutrition.g2021 Feb. 7, v. 44, no. 3 p.421-437dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl43215x1532-40877nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01904167.2020.18223983Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02867naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245011600163300001600279520149900295592002801794650001401822650002501836650002701861650002301888650001901911650001801930650001601948650001001964650002101974650001501995650001202010650003702022650001202059650003902071650002002110650001002130700001702140700001702157700001302174700002002187773011202207856008102319852000902400655001202409IND60572717320221122190847.0170717e201704  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057271732DNAL7 a10.1007/s11626-016-0119-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQiu, Yueqin10aEffect of sodium butyrate on cell proliferation and cell cycle in porcine intestinal epithelial (IPEC-J2) cells  ap. 304-311.  aConflicting results have been reported that butyrate in normal piglets leads either to an increase or to a decrease of jejunal villus length, implying a possible effect on the proliferation of enterocytes. No definitive study was found for the biological effects of butyrate in porcine jejunal epithelial cells. The present study used IPEC-J2 cells, a non-transformed jejunal epithelial line to evaluate the direct effects of sodium butyrate on cell proliferation, cell cycle regulation, and apoptosis. Low concentrations (0.5 and 1¬†mM) of butyrate had no effect on cell proliferation. However, at 5 and 10¬†mM, sodium butyrate significantly decreased cell viability, accompanied by reduced levels of p-mTOR and PCNA protein. Sodium butyrate, in a dose-dependent manner, induced cell cycle arrest in G0/G1 phase and reduced the numbers of cells in S phase. In addition, relative expression of p21, p27, and pro-apoptosis bak genes, and protein levels of p21Waf1/Cip1, p27Kip1, cyclinD3, CDK4, and Cleave-caspase3 were increased by higher concentrations of sodium butyrate (1, 5, 10¬†mM), and the levels of cyclinD1 and CDK6 were reduced by 5 and 10¬†mM butyrate. Butyrate increased the phosphorylated form of the signaling molecule p38 and phosphorylated JNK. In conclusion, the present in vitro study indicated that sodium butyrate inhibited the proliferation of IPEC-J2 cells by inducing cell cycle arrest in the G0/G1 phase of cell cycles and by increasing apoptosis at high concentrations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aapoptosis 3abioactive properties 3acell cycle checkpoints 3acell proliferation 3acell viability 3adose response 3aenterocytes 3agenes 3ain vitro studies 3ainterphase 3ajejunum 3amitogen-activated protein kinase 3apiglets 3aproliferating cell nuclear antigen 3asodium butyrate 3avilli1 aMa, Xianyong1 aYang, Xuefen1 aWang, Li1 aJiang, Zongyong0 tIn vitro cellular & developmental biology.g2017 Apr., v. 53, no. 4 p.304-311dSpringer USx1071-26907nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11626-016-0119-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02493naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002600151245009400177300001600271500002900287520126700316592002801583650002001611650002501631650002901656650001801685650001301703650001101716650001701727650002101744653000801765653003801773653004301811653001701854773015401871856008502025852000902110655001202119IND60729896720221123032618.0210304e20210316xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072989672DNAL7 a10.1080/03067319.2019.16695852doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGidde, Ranjitsinha R.10aConcave wall-based mixing chambers and convex wall-based constriction channel micromixers  ap. 561-583.  aNALT-AP-4-rerunAP2-fuzzy  aMicromixers with concave wall-based mixing chambers and convex wall-based constriction channel are studied. The effect of shape and aspect ratio of the obstacle on mixing performance was investigated for the Reynolds number in the range of 0.1‚Äì75 using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). The micromixers showed interesting mixing dynamics and flow features in respect of two flow regimes identified for the present study. The first flow regime is for the Reynolds number in the range 0.1 < Re < 5 wherein diffusion-dominated mixing was observed and the second flow regime is for the Reynolds number in the range 5 < Re ‚â§ 75 wherein convection-dominated mixing was observed. The simulation results reveal that the rectangular obstacle-based micromixer gives mixing index MI ‚â• 0.90 at the Re ‚â• 30 in all cases of aspect ratio and it is highest compared to triangular obstacle-based and teardrop obstacle-based micromixers. Further, in respect of pressure drop, teardrop obstacle-based micromixer showed less pressure drop. Both mixing index and pressure drop increase with increase in aspect ratio of the obstacle. The proposed micromixers are simple in design which make them best candidates for environmental and clinical analysis or diagnostic systems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aReynolds number 3aanalytical chemistry 3aenvironmental assessment 3ahydrodynamics 3ajournals 3amixing 3amixing ratio 3asystems analysis 0aCFD 0aconcave wall-based mixing chamber 0aconvex wall-based constriction channel 0amixing index0 tInternational journal of environmental analytical chemistry.g2021 Mar. 16, v. 101, no. 4 p.561-583dTaylor & FranciswJournal:12218x1029-03977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03067319.2019.16695853Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02857naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245009400169300001600263500001900279520147500298592002801773650002001801650001901821650001301840650002601853650001101879650001701890650001701907650002001924650001401944650001301958650000901971650001901980653001901999653002602018653001702044653001102061700002402072700002002096700003202116700002202148773012202170856008602292852000902378655001202387IND60719839420221118051810.0210312e20210207xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071983942DNAL7 a10.1080/01904167.2020.18223992doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAli, Ahmed M.10aEffect of potassium solubilizing bacteria (Bacillus cereus) on growth and yield of potato  ap. 411-420.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aPotassium solubilizing bacteria (PSB) are able to dissolve K from K-minerals and enhance plant growth and yield. A field experiment was carried out during 2017/2018‚Äì2018/2019 growing seasons in a randomized complete block design (RCBD) with three replicates. This study aims to assess the performance of bio-fertilization (Bacillus cereus) as PSB on the growth of potato (Kara Spp) and availability of N, P, and K. Potato plants were fertilized with K-feldspar and inoculated with PSB. The results showed that the PSB significantly increased the plant height (PH), branches number (BN), and shoot dry weight by about 15%, 27%, and 26%, respectively, compared to the untreated one. Soil available K increased by 42% as a result of PSB inoculation, moreover, K uptake by potato tubers increased by 62% in compassion with untreated plants. Leaf N, P, and K concentrations as well as the uptake were significantly increased in the plants inoculated with PSB compared to the un-inoculated plants. The graded weights of potato were increased by 20%, 26%, and 25%, for large, medium, and small size of tubers, respectively as a result of applying of bio-fertilizer.

We generated a conditional transgenic mouse line, carrying the telomerase reverse transcriptase (Tert) expression cassette, controlled by the Cre-loxP-mediated recombination. In our study, Cre recombinase expression efficiently activated Tert expression, resulting in its increased enzymatic activity, which extended the period of cellular proliferation until the keratinocytes entered senescence. This suggests that transgenic Tert expression is effective in enhancing primary cell proliferation. Notably, Tert expression increased colony formation of induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells after the introduction of four reprogramming factors, Oct-4, klf4, SOX-2, and c-Myc into the transgenic fibroblasts. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to show that the transgenic Tert expression enhances reprogramming efficiency of iPS cells, which indicates a critical role for Tert in the reprogramming process.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiotechnology 3acell proliferation 3acell senescence 3aenzyme activity 3afibroblasts 3agene expression 3akeratinocytes 3amice 3arecombinases 3astem cells 3atelomerase 3atelomeres 0aproliferation 0aprimary cell 0akeratinocyte 0areprogramming1 aFukuda, Tomokazu1 aDate, Shiori1 aTokitake, Yuko1 aMatsui, Yasuhisa1 aSasaki, Hiroki1 aNishimori, Katsuhiko0 tBioscience, biotechnology, and biochemistry.g2016 Oct. 2, v. 80, no. 10 p.1925-1933dTaylor & FranciswJournal:18959x1347-69477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09168451.2016.11913303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03157naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245012800168300001400296520149200310592002801802650002301830650001901853650001401872650001801886650001201904650001701916650001301933650002401946650001301970650002001983650000902003650002402012650001602036650001902052650001902071650001102090650002302101650001502124650001602139650001702155650001802172653002302190653001402213653001902227653001802246653002102264653001702285700001702302700001602319700001302335700001802348773010602366856008602472852000902558655001202567IND60533300820221120181228.0190319e20140507xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053330082DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scienta.2014.02.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Zhimin10aDifferential growth and physiological responses to heat stress between two annual and two perennial cool-season turfgrasses  ap. 75-81.  aHeat stress is a major limiting factor for the growth of cool-season turfgrass species. The objective of this study was to compare growth and physiological responses to heat stress between annual and perennial cool-season grass species. Two annual grass species, annual ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum, cv. ‚ÄòPanterra‚Äô) and annual bluegrass (Poa annua, ecotype ‚ÄòNjpl‚Äô) and two perennial grass species, perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne, cv. ‚ÄòPremier‚Äô) and rough bluegrass (Poa trivialis, cv. ‚ÄòSabre‚Äô) were exposed to three temperature regimes in growth chambers: optimal temperature control (20/15¬∞C day/night), moderate heat stress (10¬∞C above the control), and severe heat stress (20¬∞C above the control). Moderate heat stress did not cause significant physiological damages in any of the four grass species. Severe heat stress caused significant decline in turf quality (TQ), leaf relative water content (RWC), antioxidant enzyme (catalase) activity, membrane stability (EL), and resulted in severe membrane lipid peroxidation (MDA) in all four grass species. All these parameters in the two annual grass species were more responsive to severe heat stress, suggesting that the two annual species were less heat tolerant or more heat sensitive than the two perennial species. Differential heat responses between the two annual and two perennial grass species could be associated with the differences in the severity of leaf senescence, as manifested by TQ, EL, and MDA.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLolium multiflorum 3aLolium perenne 3aPoa annua 3aPoa trivialis 3aannuals 3aantioxidants 3acatalase 3acool season grasses 3aecotypes 3agrowth chambers 3aheat 3aheat shock response 3aheat stress 3aheat tolerance 3alawns and turf 3aleaves 3alipid peroxidation 3aperennials 3atemperature 3aturf grasses 3awater content 0aLolium multiflorum 0aPoa annua 0aLolium perenne 0aPoa trivialis 0aHigh temperature 0aTurf quality1 aMiao, Yuchun1 aYu, Jingjin1 aLiu, Jun1 aHuang, Bingru0 tScientia horticulturae.g2014 May 07, v. 170 p.75-81dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4108x0304-42387nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scienta.2014.02.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02988naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001500147245009000162300001600252520164100268592002801909650001901937650001401956650001501970650001801985650002002003650003102023650001002054650002202064650002102086650002102107650001802128650000902146650002102155650002402176650002902200650003302229700001802262700001502280700001502295700001802310773011202328856008102440852000902521655001202530IND60572717420221122190757.0170717e201704  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057271742DNAL7 a10.1007/s11626-016-0122-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHu, De-Bao10aEffect of potential role of p53 on embryo development arrest induced by H2O2 in mouse  ap. 344-353.  aDuring mammalian embryo development in vitro, mechanism of embryonic development arrest caused by oxidative stress has not been clear so far. The tumor suppressor protein p53 controls cell cycle and programmed cell death by regulating relevant signal pathway. Recent researches revealed that the concentration and distribution of p53 are closely related with reactive oxygen species (ROS). The main objective of this experiment was to explore the role of p53 on embryonic development arrest caused by oxidative stress. Results showed that embryo arrest at two‚Äìfour-cell stage was significantly increased in the presence of 50¬†ŒºM H‚ÇÇO‚ÇÇ (39.01¬†¬±¬†2.74 vs. 77.20¬†¬±¬†5.34%, p¬†<¬†0.05). Supplementation of N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) obviously reduced the ratio of development arrest (39.01¬†¬±¬†2.74 vs. 71.18¬†¬±¬†5.34%, p¬†<¬†0.05), which was accompanied by an increase in ROS level, and H‚ÇÇO‚ÇÇ treatment sharply increased messenger RNA (mRNA) expression and protein levels of p53 and p53-ser15. Further increased transcription of GADD45a and p21, a downstream of p53, has an especially significant effect on the mRNA expression of GADD45a. However, expressions of cdc2 were reduced by H‚ÇÇO‚ÇÇ. In addition, using Pifithrin-Œ± (PFT-Œ±), the suppresser of p53, the result showed that GADD45a and p21 were significantly downregulated, but the cell cycle gene cdc2 was significantly upregulated, while the protein level of p53 and p53-ser15 was significantly decreased. Taken together, these results demonstrate that ROS could activate p53 and regulate p53 target genes to influence early embryo development in in vitro culture.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetylcysteine 3aapoptosis 3acell cycle 3aembryogenesis 3agene expression 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3ahydrogen peroxide 3ain vitro culture 3ain vitro studies 3amessenger RNA 3amice 3aoxidative stress 3asignal transduction 3atranscription (genetics) 3atumor suppressor protein p531 aLi, Zhong-Shu1 aAli, Ihsan1 aXu, Li-Jie1 aFang, Nan-Zhu0 tIn vitro cellular & developmental biology.g2017 Apr., v. 53, no. 4 p.344-353dSpringer USx1071-26907nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11626-016-0122-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02415naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001700144245006700161300001800228500001100246520116000257592002801417596006201445650002801507650001401535650001001549650003001559650002301589650002201612650002101634650003001655650003701685700001801722700005401740700001601794773013201810856007801942852000902020655001202029IND60642329820221117205444.0190507e201905  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064232982DNAL7 a10.1002/jssc.2018009522doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Jiahui12aA review on analytical methods for natural berberine alkaloids  ap. 1794-1815.  aREVIEW  aBerberine alkaloids, a group of protoberberine alkaloids under the classification of isoquinoline alkaloids, include berberine, coptisine, palmatine, columbamine, dehydrocorydaline, jatrorrhizine, and epiberberine from natural sources. Studies have shown that berberine alkaloids have various pharmacological functions, such as antibacterial, antiviral, blood pressure‚Äêlowering, hypoglycaemic, antiarrhythmia, and anticancer effects. Therefore, it is worthwhile to develop analytical methods to investigate the pharmacokinetics and activity mechanisms of berberine alkaloids and to study berberine alkaloids more comprehensively. Current analytical methods for berberine alkaloids include liquid chromatography, thin‚Äêlayer chromatography, ultraviolet spectroscopy, capillary electrophoresis, and gas chromatography. The most widely used detection method is mass spectrometry. In order to provide a systematic and comprehensive summary and to serve as a reference for the future pharmacokinetics studies and analysis of berberine alkaloids, analytical methods for natural berberine alkaloids that have been used in the past ten years are reviewed here.  aPublisher supplied data  a17401902300cShanghai Committee of Science and Technology 3aantineoplastic activity 3aberberine 3ablood 3acapillary electrophoresis 3agas chromatography 3amass spectrometry 3apharmacokinetics 3athin layer chromatography 3aultraviolet-visible spectroscopy1 aJiang, Yanyan1 aWang, Bing1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9646-04041 aZhang, Ning0 tJournal of separation science.g2019 May, v. 42, no. 9 p.1794-1815dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3924049x1615-93067nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jssc.2018009523Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02599naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245010000167300001800267520111300285592002801398650002601426650001501452650002301467650001901490650002601509650001501535650002001550650000901570650001801579650001801597650001301615650001301628700005901641700005501700700006001755700006401815700005401879700001901933773012201952856008202074852000902156655001202165IND60636351520221122065318.0190408e20190308xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063635152DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.biomac.8b018202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOkishima, Anna10aDesign of Synthetic Polymer Nanoparticles Specifically Capturing Indole, a Small Toxic Molecule  ap. 1644-1654.  aSynthetic polymers are of interest as stable and cost-effective biomolecule-affinity reagents, since these polymers interact with target biomolecules both in vitro and in the bloodstream. However, little has been reported about orally administered polymers capable of capturing a target molecule and inhibiting its intestinal absorption. Here, we describe the design of synthetic polymer nanoparticles (NPs) specifically capturing indole, a major factor exacerbating chronic kidney disease, in the intestine. N-isopropylacrylamide-based NPs were prepared with various hydrophobic monomers. The amounts of indole captured by NPs depended on the structures and feed ratios of the hydrophobic monomers and the polymer density but not on the particle size. The combination of hydrophobic and quadrupole interaction was effective to enhance the affinity and specificity of NPs for indole. The optimized NPs specifically inhibited intestinal absorption of orally administered indole in mice. These results showed the potential of synthetic polymer NPs for inhibiting the intestinal absorption of a target molecule.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiochemical compounds 3ablood flow 3acost effectiveness 3ahydrophobicity 3aintestinal absorption 3aintestines 3akidney diseases 3amice 3ananoparticles 3aparticle size 3apolymers 3atoxicity1 aKoide, Hiroyuki1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1763-65931 aHoshino, Yu1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9628-69791 aEgami, Hiromichi1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7784-49871 aHamashima, Yoshitaka1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6509-89561 aOku, Naoto1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1933-25451 aAsai, Tomohiro0 tBiomacromolecules.g2019 Mar. 08, v. 20, no. 4 p.1644-1654dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:12556x1526-46027nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.biomac.8b018203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03321naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100002400154245020000178300001600378520136800394592002801762650002201790650001001812650002101822650001501843650002101858650002601879650002601905650002701931650002601958650002201984650001502006650001202021650003002033650001102063650001102074650002802085650002102113650002802134650001002162650002402172650001302196650002102209650001102230650004402241650003302285650002102318650001402339650000902353653002002362653000802382653000802390653001802398653001602416653001202432700001802444773012302462856008902585852000902674655001202683IND60543420120221120070741.0190410e201510  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054342012DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jphotobiol.2015.07.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDhanaraj, C.

The compounds were characterized by elemental analyses, molar conductance, magnetic susceptibility, IR, UV‚ÄìVis., 1H NMR, mass and ESR spectra. Octahedral geometry has been assigned for Co(II), Ni(II) and Zn(II) complexes and distorted octahedral geometry for Cu(II) complex. Electrochemical behavior of the synthesized complexes was studied using cyclic voltammetry. Grain size and surface morphologies of the complexes were determined by powder XRD and SEM analyses. The mixed ligand metal complexes were screened for antimicrobial activity against bacterial species Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus; fungal species Aspergillus niger, and Candida albicans by disc diffusion method. The DNA binding and DNA cleavage activities of the compounds were determined using electronic absorption titration and agarose gel electrophoresis respectively. The superoxide radical scavenging and free radical scavenging activities of the Cu(II) complex was also evaluated. Molecular docking studies of the synthesized mixed ligand metal complexes were carried out against B-DNA dodecamer and the protein Plasmodium falciparum dihydrofolate reductase (pf DHFR).  aPublisher supplied data 3aAspergillus niger 3aB-DNA 3aCandida albicans 3aDNA damage 3aEscherichia coli 3aKlebsiella pneumoniae 3aPlasmodium falciparum 3aPseudomonas aeruginosa 3aStaphylococcus aureus 3aX-ray diffraction 3aabsorption 3aagarose 3aanti-infective properties 3acobalt 3acopper 3adihydrofolate reductase 3aelectrochemistry 3afree radical scavengers 3afungi 3agel electrophoresis 3ageometry 3amolecular models 3anickel 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asuperoxide anion 3atitration 3azinc 0aElectrochemical 0aXRD 0aDNA 0aAntimicrobial 0aSuper oxide 0aDocking1 aJohnson, Jijo0 tJournal of photochemistry and photobiology.g2015 Oct., v. 151 p.100-109dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6193x1011-13447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jphotobiol.2015.07.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03358naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005600148245013800204300001600342500001900358520185200377592002802229596005202257650001202309650003002321650002602351650001102377650001102388650001202399650002202411650001802433650002102451650002902472650001302501651001202514700005902526700005902585700007002644773013102714856008202845852000902927655001202936IND60738265920221122021410.0210522e202106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073826592DNAL7 a10.1007/s11273-021-09790-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aClare, Shari1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2702-704910aDoes drainage pay? Quantifying agricultural profitability associated with wetland drainage practices and canola production in Alberta  ap. 397-415.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aConversion of wetlands in cultivated agricultural landscapes is one of the primary drivers of wetland loss in Alberta, Canada, despite a provincial wetland policy that prioritizes wetland avoidance. While other sectors of the agricultural industry have established initiatives to maintain wetlands, a common narrative within the conventional cropping sector is that wetland retention leads to lost acreage and overlap of crop inputs, and that there are financial benefits associated with wetland drainage. The objective of this research was to explicitly quantify crop productivity within drained wetland basins, in an effort to better understand the extent to which producers financially benefit from drainage practices. Working collaboratively with canola producers in central Alberta over the 2019 growing season, wetland basins within four quarter sections were mapped using an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle, and wetland basins with clear evidence of surface drainage were identified. Agricultural input and yield data provided by producers was then used to quantify profitability within each drained basin. Average profit for drained basins for each producer ranged between ‚àí $145/acre and $76/acre, with an average of $55/acre across all operations. This is compared to an average profit of $203/acre for non-wetland areas across all operations. The results suggest that the financial benefits of drainage are highly variable, and for many drained basins, producers may experience financial losses that may be overlooked when profits are examined only at the field- or operation-level. While this study included a small number of operations, and was limited to one type of crop over a single growing season, the results still provide important insight into the extent to which producers benefit financially from the practice of wetland drainage.  aPublisher supplied data  a015-00-90-280cAlberta Conservation Association 3aacreage 3aadministrative management 3aagricultural industry 3abasins 3acanola 3aecology 3aissues and policy 3aprofitability 3asurface drainage 3aunmanned aerial vehicles 3awetlands 3aAlberta1 aDanielson, Brad1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3581-22741 aKoenig, Shantel1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5959-26081 aPattison-Williams, John K.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5799-25870 tWetlands ecology and management.g2021 June, v. 29, no. 3 p.397-415dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl3870260x0923-48617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11273-021-09790-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03371naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100005100137245016500188300001800353500002000371520171200391592002802103596011402131596007602245596005902321596007102380650001902451650002302470650002302493650001402516650003102530650001202561650003102573650001602604650001902620650001302639651001002652700002102662700001502683700001902698773012702717856007202844852000902916655001202925IND60792052120221120094241.0220904e202210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079205212DNAL7 a10.1002/ps.70242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Lei1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3995-413810aComparing the cost‚Äìbenefit probability of management based on early‚Äêstage and late‚Äêstage economic thresholds with that of seed treatment of Aphis glycines  ap. 4048-4060.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aBACKGROUND: The current integrated pest management (IPM) curative strategy for soybean aphid, Aphis glycines Matsumura (Hemiptera: Aphididae), relies on responsive spraying foliar insecticides during the R1‚ÄìR5 soybean stage when aphid abundance reaches the economic threshold (ET) of 250 aphids plant‚Åª¬π (traditional IPM). By analyzing the relationship between aphid abundance and yield loss before the R1 stage, we developed an early‚Äêstage ET. We propose to spray foliar insecticides on plants colonized with aphids using the early‚Äêstage ET as a trigger (improved IPM), together with seed treatment to manage A. glycines and delay them exceeding the ET of 250 aphids plant‚Åª¬π in the late stage for whole‚Äêfield spraying (traditional IPM). Finally, we compared the cost‚Äìbenefit probabilities of the three management approaches. RESULTS: The early‚Äêstage ET over all potential yields, market prices, and control costs was 64 aphids plant‚Åª¬π, providing growers 7‚Äâdays of preparation time to spray foliar insecticides before the economic injury level of 187 aphids plant‚Åª¬π was reached. Improved IPM achieved the highest cost‚Äìbenefit probabilities followed by traditional IPM, and the seed treatment achieved the lowest. However, in fields where the pressure from white grubs was high, the probability of achieving a positive net return with seed treatment was higher than that in other locations. CONCLUSION: Improved IPM based on early‚Äêstage ET of 64 aphids plant‚Åª¬π was the most cost‚Äêeffective of all the three approaches. Neonicotinoid seed treatment can be applied as an insurance strategy to supplement A. glycines IPM in Liaoning, China. ¬© 2022 Society of Chemical Industry.  aPublisher supplied data  cChinese National Special Fund for Agro‚Äêscientific Research in the Public Interest (201003025 and 201103022)  cNational Key Research and Development Program of China (2018YFD0201004)  cNational Key Research and Development Program of China  cSpecial Fund for Agro‚Äêscientific Research in the Public Interest 3aAphis glycines 3acost effectiveness 3aeconomic threshold 3ainsurance 3aintegrated pest management 3amarkets 3aneonicotinoid insecticides 3aprobability 3aseed treatment 3asoybeans 3aChina1 aZhao, Tong‚ÄêHua1 aXing, Xing1 aXu, Guo‚ÄêQing0 tPest management science.g2022 Oct., v. 78, no. 10 p.4048-4060dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.wJournal:jnl59519x1526-498X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ps.70243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03822naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100006200140245015600202500002000358520216900378592002802547596008502575596013302660650001902793650001802812650001802830650001202848650001702860650001102877650001202888650001702900650001802917650001202935650001102947650001502958650002702973650002003000650001503020650001503035700002003050700002103070700002303091700001703114773012603131856007403257852000903331655001203340IND60694344920221122070252.0200513e202005  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069434492DNAL7 a10.1111/jfbc.131712doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Guang‚Äêjing1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6968-016910aComparisons of prebiotic activity of polysaccharides from shoot residues of bamboo (Chimonobambusa quadrangularis) via different ethanol concentrations  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThree polysaccharide fractions from bamboo shoot (Chimonobambusa quadrangularis), CPS70, CPS75, and CPS80, were prepared using a final ethanol concentration of 70%, 75%, and 80% in the precipitation process. In vitro digestibility and the prebiotic activity of CPS70, CPS75, and CPS80 were evaluated and compared. The results indicated that all three of the CPS fractions exhibit a high degree of nondigestibility to human gastric juice (>98.5%) or Œ±‚Äêamylase hydrolysis (>94.5%). Compared with the blank control, the three CPS fractions could not only significantly (p¬†<¬†.05) stimulate the proliferation of B. adolescentis, B. infantis, B. bifidum, and L. acidophilus, but also significantly (p¬†<¬†.05) enhance the production of lactic, acetic, propionic, and butyric acids when these polysaccharides were added as alternative carbon sources to glucose during the in vitro fermentation of four probiotics. Furthermore, when comparing the three CPS fractions, CPS75 displayed the strongest prebiotic potential, as this polysaccharide had the strongest effect on the proliferation of probiotic bacteria as well as the greatest effect on SCFAs production. These results demonstrated that the concentration of ethanol used during the precipitation process has a significant impact on the prebiotic activity of CPS. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Ethanol precipitation is the first step when extracting polysaccharides from aqueous extracts as it is simple, rapid, and easy to carry out. This study focuses on how different concentrations of ethanol used in the precipitation process affect the prebiotic potential of bamboo shoot (Chimonobambusa quadrangularis) polysaccharides (CPS). The result indicated that the concentration of ethanol used during the precipitation process has a significant impact on the prebiotic activity of CPS. To our knowledge, it is the first to evaluate the effects of the concentration of ethanol during the process of precipitation on prebiotic potential of polysaccharides, which can subsequently be applied to the optimization of ethanol concentration when precipitating natural polysaccharides for the purpose of in vitro fermentation.  aPublisher supplied data  a[2011]4001cProgram for Guizhou Engineering Research Center for Fruit Processing  a20130355110cthe Project of Collaborative Innovation Center for Fruit Processing, Storage, and Safety of Guizhou Province, China 3aChimonobambusa 3aalpha-amylase 3abamboo shoots 3abamboos 3abutyric acid 3acarbon 3aethanol 3afermentation 3agastric juice 3aglucose 3ahumans 3ahydrolysis 3ain vitro digestibility 3apolysaccharides 3aprebiotics 3aprobiotics1 aRan, Chun‚Äêxia1 aLi, Chang‚Äêfeng1 aXiong, Zheng‚Äêwei1 aMa, Li‚Äêzhi0 tJournal of food biochemistry.g2020 May, v. 44, no. 5 p.e13171-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl8484x0145-88847nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jfbc.131713Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02495naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100002300154245009100177300001600268520081100284592002801095650001801123650001501141650002401156650001701180650001201197650001901209650001901228650001601247650002001263650002001283653000701303653000801310653000901318653000901327653000901336653000801345653000701353653000801360653000901368653001801377653001401395653001801409653002201427653001901449653001601468700002301484700002101507700002301528700005801551700003101609700004401640773012301684856008901807852000901896655001201905IND60543420320221120070654.0190410e201511  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054342032DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jphotobiol.2015.07.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSinetova, Maria A.10aAquaporin-deficient mutant of Synechocystis is sensitive to salt and high-light stress  ap. 377-382.  aCyanobacterial aquaporins play an important role in the regulation of various physiological functions: cell volume control, osmotic stress responses, gas exchange. We employed the AqpZ-deficient mutant of Synechocystis to study the role of aquaporins in responses to salt (NaCl) and high light stress. Electron microscopy and paramagnetic resonance revealed that AqpZ-deficient cells are unable to efficiently regulate the cytoplasmic volume under salt stress. Both photosystems (PSII and, especially, PSI) of these cells are more sensitive to NaCl and to high light. Thus, AqpZ of Synechocystis participates in regulation of the photosynthetic activity of PSI and PSII under salt and high-light stress.

Growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF-15) is a regulatory cytokine mainly of the inflammatory and angiogenesis pathways, but potentially also involved in bone mineralization. We sought to determine whether these two circulating biomarkers jointly influenced morbidity and mortality risk in patients with chronic coronary heart disease (CHD).894 patients ‚â•6 months after myocardial infarction and/or coronary revascularization at baseline were followed in a prospective study. All-cause and cardiovascular mortality, non-fatal cardiovascular events (myocardial infarction, stroke, any revascularization), and hospitalization for heart failure (HF) were followed as outcomes. Desphospho-uncarboxylated MGP (dp-ucMGP) was used as a biomarker of vitamin K status.Both, increased concentrations of dp-ucMGP (‚â•884¬†pmol/L) and GDF-15 (‚â•1339¬†pg/mL) were identified as independent predictors of 5-year all-cause or cardiovascular mortality. However, their coincidence further increased mortality risk. The highest risk was observed in patients with high dp-ucMGP plus high GDF-15, not only when compared with those with ‚Äúnormal‚Äù concentrations of both biomarkers [HR 5.51 (95% CI 2.91‚Äì10.44), p¬†<¬†0.0001 and 6.79 (95% CI 3.06‚Äì15.08), p¬†<¬†0.0001 for all-cause and cardiovascular mortality, respectively], but even when compared with patients with only one factor increased. This pattern was less convincing with non-fatal cardiovascular events or hospitalization for HF.The individual coincidence of low vitamin K status (high dp-ucMGP) and high GDF-15 expression predicts poor survival of stable CHD patients.  aPublisher supplied data 3aangiogenesis 3abiomarkers 3abone mineralization 3acalcification 3acoronary disease 3acytokines 3aheart failure 3ametabolism 3amorbidity 3amortality 3amyocardial infarction 3apatients 3aprospective studies 3arisk 3astroke 3avitamin K 3avitamin status 0aMatrix Œ≥-carboxyglutamate protein (MGP) 0adp-ucMGP 0aAll-cause death 0aCardiovascular death 0aNon-fatal cardiovascular events 0aEUROASPIRE1 aBruthans, Jan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4307-22021 aSeidlerov√°, Jitka,1 aKarnosov√°, Petra1 aMate≈ô√°nkov√°, Mark√©ta1 aGel≈æinsk√Ω, Julius1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8335-92081 aRycheck√°, Martina1 aOpatrn√Ω, Jan1 aWohlfahrt, Peter1 aKuƒçera, Radek1 aTrefil, Ladislav1 aC√≠fkov√°, Renata1 aFilipovsk√Ω, Jan1 aVermeer, Cees0 tNutrition, metabolism, and cardiovascular diseases.g2021 Feb. 08, v. 31, no. 2 p.540-551dElsevier B.V.aThe Italian Diabetes Society, the Italian Society for the Study of Atherosclerosis, the Italian Society of Human Nutrition and the Department of Clinical Medicine and Surgery, Federico II UniversitywJournal:11953x0939-47537nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.numecd.2020.09.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03531naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100005700139245013600196300001600332500002000348520184800368592002802216596001902244650001702263650002502280650001602305650002102321650002102342650001102363650002402374650001202398650003402410650001602444650001402460650003202474650002002506650001602526650001902542650001302561650003202574650001602606650002602622650001302648650001402661650000902675651001202684651001702696700002202713700002002735773014002755856007302895852000902968655001202977IND60694345020221122161434.0200513e202006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069434502DNAL7 a10.1111/jhn.127122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlissa, E.

We also aimed to examine the relationship between nutrient intakes and knee OA severity. METHODS: One hundred female participants with symptomatic primary knee OA were matched for age with 100 apparently healthy females and were sequentially recruited from the Orthopaedics Department, Faculty of Medicine, King Abdulaziz University Hospital, Saudi Arabia, in a case‚Äìcontrol study design. Radiographic disease severity of OA was assessed by the Kellgren‚ÄìLawrence grading system. Symptomatic severity was evaluated according to the Western Ontario McMaster University Osteoarthritis scores. Dietary intake was assessed using a prevalidated food frequency questionnaire. The DAQ score was calculated considering the risk of an inadequate intake (<2/3 reference nutrient intake) for selenium, zinc, vitamins A, C and E. RESULTS: A higher intake of saturated fatty acids [15.4¬†(0.3) as a mean (SD) percentage of energy supplied] and monounsaturated fatty acids [16.6¬†(0.2) as a percentage of energy supplied] than the recommendations was evident among the study population. OA patients consume less antioxidants than non‚ÄêOA subjects as determined by their DAQ score [8.41¬†(0.1) versus 9.17¬†(0.1), P¬†<¬†0.0001]. After adjusting for potential confounders, DAQ score, and monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids, most of the micronutrient intakes were found to be negatively associated with the prevalence of radiographic knee OA. CONCLUSIONS: Dietary antioxidants could be implicated in the development and progression of knee OA. Modifying dietary fatty acids may be one way of reducing the development and subsequent burden of knee OA.  aPublisher supplied data  a89‚Äê36cKACST 3aantioxidants 3acase-control studies 3adietary fat 3adietary minerals 3adisease severity 3aenergy 3aexperimental design 3afemales 3afood frequency questionnaires 3afood intake 3ahospitals 3amonounsaturated fatty acids 3anutrient intake 3aorthopedics 3aosteoarthritis 3apatients 3apolyunsaturated fatty acids 3aradiography 3asaturated fatty acids 3aselenium 3avitamin A 3azinc 3aOntario 3aSaudi Arabia1 aAlzughaibi, L.

They have also been recently recognized to have great potential as anthelmintic agents in targeting parasitic roundworms (e.g., hookworms). The most extensively characterized of the anthelmintic Cry proteins is Cry5B. We report here the 2.3 √Ö resolution structure of the proteolytically activated form of Cry5B. This structure, which is the first for a nematicidal Cry protein, shows the familiar three-domain arrangement seen in insecticidal Cry proteins. However, domain II is unusual in that it more closely resembles a banana lectin than it does other Cry proteins. This result is consistent with the fact that the receptor for Cry5B consists of a set of invertebrate-specific glycans (attached to lipids) and also suggests that domain II is important for receptor binding. We found that not only galactose but also N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) is an efficient competitor for binding between Cry5B and glycolipids. GalNAc is one of the core arthroseries tetrasaccharides of the Cry5B receptor and galactose an antennary sugar that emanates from this core. These and prior data suggest that the minimal binding determinant for Cry5B consists of a core GalNAc and two antennary galactoses. Lastly, the protoxin form of Cry5B was found to bind nematode glycolipids with a specificity equal to that of activated Cry5B, but with lower affinity. This suggests that the initial binding of Cry5B protoxin to glycolipids can be stabilized at the nematode cell surface by proteolysis. These results lay the groundwork for the design of effective Cry5B-based anthelmintics.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aNematoda 3aanthelmintics 3abananas 3abinding properties 3agalactose 3aglycolipids 3ahookworms 3ainsecticides 3alectins 3anematicidal properties 3apolysaccharides 3aproteolysis1 aScheib, Ulrike1 aHu, Yan1 aSommer, Ralf J.1 aAroian, Raffi

The quality of drinking water from source and distribution system was investigated, and the hydrochemical characteristics and formation mechanisms of groundwater were analyzed. Statistical summary showed higher mean values of major descriptors in distributed groundwater samples compared with source groundwater samples. A total of 50 drinking water samples (16 from source, and 34 from distribution system) were examined for physical, chemical and bacteriological parameters, including pH, turbidity, electrical conductivity, total dissolved solids, total hardness, total alkalinity, Ca¬≤‚Å∫, Mg¬≤‚Å∫, Na‚Å∫, K‚Å∫, SO‚ÇÑ ¬≤‚Åª, Cl‚Åª, NO‚ÇÉ ‚Åª, F‚Åª, arsenic (As) chromium (Cr), iron (Fe), copper (Cu), zinc (Zn), cadmium (Cd) and lead (Pb). Varying concentrations of trace amounts of Cr (in 8 samples), Fe (18 samples), Cu (18 samples), Zn (13 samples) and Pb (14 samples) were detected. However, the detected trace elements were within the WHO permissible limits for drinking water except Pb where 5 out of 14 samples showed higher than WHO limit value (Pb¬†>¬†0.01¬†mg/L). 19 out of 50 samples (6 from source and 13 from distributed samples) showed high values of alkalinity (>250¬†mg/L). All of 16 groundwater samples from source exceeded 0.01¬†mg/L WHO limit value for arsenic (As). On the basis of bacteriological analysis, 42¬†% samples (12¬†% from source, 55¬†% from distribution) did not meet WHO guidelines and were unsafe for drinking, especially distributed groundwater samples. Mg‚ÄìHCO‚ÇÉ contents predominated the groundwater type followed by Ca‚ÄìHCO‚ÇÉ. Carbonate weathering was revealed to be the dominant process controlling dissolution/precipitation processes. PHREEQC modeling showed that the aqueous phase was undersaturated with respect to significant gypsum, halite and mirabilite while equilibrium to saturated with respect to aragonite, calcite and dolomite was observed. Principal component analysis (PCA) revealed that the concentration of As was strongly associated with that of SO‚ÇÑ ¬≤‚Åª. Reductive dissolution and pH-dependent desorption are the plausible processes responsible for the observed high As concentrations in Lahore.  aPublisher supplied data 3aWorld Health Organization 3aalkalinity 3aaragonite 3aarsenic 3acadmium 3acalcite 3acalcium 3achlorides 3achromium 3acopper 3adesorption 3adolomite 3adrinking 3adrinking water 3aelectrical conductivity 3afluorides 3agroundwater 3aguidelines 3agypsum 3ahardness 3ahydrochemistry 3airon 3alead 3amagnesium 3amirabilite 3amodels 3anitrates 3apH 3apeople 3apotassium 3aprincipal component analysis 3asampling 3asodium 3asulfates 3atotal dissolved solids 3aturbidity 3aweathering 3azinc 3aPakistan1 aSu, Chunli1 aTahira, Fazeelat1 aMapoma, Harold Wilson Tumwitike1 aAziz, Syed Zahid0 tEnvironmental earth sciences.g2015 Sept., v. 74, no. 5 p.4281-4294dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx1866-62807nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12665-015-4432-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03391naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005400148245013100202300001800333520180000351592002802151650002102179650002702200650002602227650003102253650002902284650002602313650002702339650001302366650001502379650001902394650000902413650001902422650002602441650002302467650001502490650001302505650001302518650001802531650001302549700002502562700002002587700002102607700005602628773012202684856008202806852000902888655001202897IND60636351820221122065444.0190408e20190307xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063635182DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.biomac.9b000292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPeng, Chao1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5672-632410aStructure‚ÄìActivity Study of Antibacterial Poly(ester urethane)s with Uniform Distribution of Hydrophobic and Cationic Groups  ap. 1675-1682.  aInfections associated with antibiotic-resistant bacteria have become a threat to the global public health. Antimicrobial polymers, which are synthetic mimics of antimicrobial peptides, have gained increasing attention, as they may have a lower chance of inducing resistance. The cationic‚Äìhydrophobic balance and distribution of cationic and hydrophobic moieties of these polymers is known to have a major effect on antimicrobial activity. We studied the properties of a series of facially amphiphilic antimicrobial surfactant-like poly(ester urethane)s with different hydrophobic pendant groups (P1, P2, and P3) and cationic groups distributed uniformly along the polymer chain. These polymers exhibited bactericidal activity against Gram-negative Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, as well as Gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis. Microscopy and dye release assays demonstrated that these polymers cause membrane disruption, which is dependent on the cationic‚Äìhydrophobic ratio in the polymer. Membrane permeability assays revealed that these polymers can permeabilize the outer membrane of E. coli and damage the cytoplasmic membrane of both E. coli and S. aureus. In addition, our results indicate that the three polymers exhibit a different extent of membrane disruption against E. coli. P1 caused minor damage to the cytoplasmic membrane integrity, but it was able to dissipate the cytoplasmic membrane potential, leading to cell death. P2 and P3 depolarized the cytoplasmic membrane and also caused significant damage to the cytoplasmic membrane. Overall, we showed a new class of broad-spectrum bactericidal polymers whose membrane disrupting ability against E. coli correlates with the structural differences of the hydrophobic pendant groups.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aPseudomonas aeruginosa 3aStaphylococcus aureus 3aStaphylococcus epidermidis 3aantibacterial properties 3aantibiotic resistance 3aantimicrobial peptides 3abacteria 3acell death 3acell membranes 3adyes 3ahydrophobicity 3amembrane permeability 3amembrane potential 3amicroscopy 3amoieties 3apolymers 3apublic health 3aurethane1 aVishwakarma, Apoorva1 aMankoci, Steven1 aBarton, Hazel A.1 aJoy, Abraham1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7781-38170 tBiomacromolecules.g2019 Mar. 07, v. 20, no. 4 p.1675-1682dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:12556x1526-46027nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.biomac.9b000293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03209naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245010800157300001600265500002000281520141200301592002801713596005001741596005001791596005001841596005001891650002101941650001501962650002601977650002402003650001002027650001602037650001202053650001402065650002002079650004302099650005202142650000902194650001002203650001102213650001702224650002102241700001402262700001802276700001702294700001802311700001202329700001702341700001602358700001902374700001802393773013702411856007402548852000902622655001202631IND60642330220221120144813.0190507e201905  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064233022DNAL7 a10.1111/jipb.127272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXiao, Yunhua10aBig Grain3, encoding a purine permease, regulates grain size via modulating cytokinin transport in rice  ap. 581-597.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aGrain size is an important agronomic trait affecting grain yield, but the underlying molecular mechanisms remain to be elucidated. Here, we isolated a dominant mutant, big grain3 (bg3‚ÄêD), which exhibits a remarkable increase of grain size caused by activation of the PURINE PERMEASE gene, OsPUP4. BG3/OsPUP4 is predominantly expressed in vascular tissues and is specifically suppressed by exogenous cytokinin application. Hormone profiling revealed that the distribution of different cytokinin forms, in roots and shoots of the bg3‚ÄêD mutant, is altered. Quantitative reverse transcription‚ÄêPCR (qRT‚ÄêPCR) analysis indicated that expression of rice cytokinin type‚ÄêA RESPONSE REGULATOR (OsRR) genes is enhanced in the roots of the bg3‚ÄêD mutant. These results suggest that OsPUP4 might contribute to the long‚Äêdistance transport of cytokinin, by reinforcing cytokinin loading into vascular bundle cells. Furthermore, plants overexpressing OsPUP7, the closest homolog of OsPUP4, also exhibited a similar phenotype to the bg3‚ÄêD mutant. Interestingly, subcellular localization demonstrated that OsPUP4 was localized on the plasma membrane, whereas OsPUP7 was localized to the endoplasmic reticulum. Based on these findings, we propose that OsPUP4 and OsPUP7 function in a linear pathway to direct cytokinin cell‚Äêto‚Äêcell transport, affecting both its long‚Äêdistance movement and local allocation.  aPublisher supplied data  a91735302cNational Natural Science Foundation  a31722037cNational Natural Science Foundation  a91435106cNational Natural Science Foundation  a91335203cNational Natural Science Foundation 3aagronomic traits 3acytokinins 3aendoplasmic reticulum 3agene overexpression 3agenes 3agrain yield 3amutants 3aphenotype 3aplasma membrane 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3arice 3aroots 3ashoots 3atransporters 3avascular tissues1 aLiu, Dapu1 aZhang, Guoxia1 aGao, Shaopei1 aLiu, Linchuan1 aXu, Fan1 aChe, Ronghui1 aWang, Yiqin1 aTong, Hongning1 aChu, Chengcai0 tJournal of integrative plant biology.g2019 May, v. 61, no. 5 p.581-597dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3949844x1672-90727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jipb.127273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04095naa a2200733 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005800150245011700208300001600325500001400341520172400355592002802079650001902107650001402126650001802140650001702158650001902175650002002194650002802214650002102242650001202263650001402275650001902289650004102308650002202349650001402371650000802385650001502393650001402408650001502422650001302437650000902450650002402459650001102483650001602494650001002510651001102520653001802531653002002549653001702569653001202586653002502598653001802623653001002641653000702651653000802658653001002666700001802676700002602694700005602720700001902776700001702795700002302812700005602835700002302891773034102914856008503255852000903340655001203349IND60713997820221119052944.0210219e20210208xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071399782DNAL7 a10.1016/j.numecd.2020.09.0222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNash, Sarah H.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9038-600110aTen-year weight gain is not associated with multiple cardiometabolic measures in Alaska EARTH study participants  ap. 403-410.  aNAL-light  aAlaska Native (AN) traditional lifestyle may be protective against chronic disease risk. Weight gain in adulthood has been linked to increases in chronic disease risk among other populations; yet, its impact among Alaska Native people has never been evaluated. We aimed to evaluate changes in obesity-related metrics over time, and determine associations of changes with cardiometabolic markers of chronic disease risk among AN people.Study participants enrolled in the southcentral Alaska Education and Research Towards Health Study in 2004‚Äì2006 were invited to participate in a follow-up study conducted 2015‚Äì2017. Of the original 1320 participants, 388 completed follow-up health assessments consisting of multiple health surveys, anthropometric measurements, and cardiometabolic measures including blood sugars, blood lipids, and blood pressure. Differences in measurements between visits were determined and associations of weight change with cardiometabolic measures evaluated. Body mass index increased by 3.7¬†kg/m¬≤ among men and 4.8¬†kg/m¬≤ among women. Hip circumference (1.1¬†cm, p¬†<¬†0.01) and waist circumference (0.7¬†cm, p¬†<¬†0.01) increased among women; only waist circumference increased among men (1.6¬†cm, p¬†<¬†0.01). Among men, there were no associations of weight change with cardiometabolic measures. Among women, there was an inverse association between weight gain and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol only (0.17¬†mg/dL (CI: ‚àí3.1, ‚àí0.03), p¬†=¬†0.02).While weight increase over a 10-year period was not associated with substantive changes in cardiometabolic measures among AN men, there was a decrease in high density lipid cholesterol associated with weight gain among AN women.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAlaska Natives 3aadulthood 3ablood glucose 3ablood lipids 3ablood pressure 3abody mass index 3acardiovascular diseases 3achronic diseases 3adensity 3aeducation 3ahealth surveys 3ahigh density lipoprotein cholesterol 3ahip circumference 3alifestyle 3amen 3ametabolism 3anutrition 3apopulation 3aresearch 3arisk 3awaist circumference 3aweight 3aweight gain 3awomen 3aAlaska 0aAlaska native 0aNative American 0aCohort study 0aObesity 0aChronic disease risk 0aWeight change 0aAI/AN 0aAN 0aBMI 0aEARTH1 aDay, Gretchen1 aHiratsuka, Vanessa Y.1 aBeans, Julie1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4363-97631 aRedwood, Diana1 aHolck, Peter1 aHoward, Barbara V.1 aUmans, Jason1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2746-33501 aKoller, Kathryn R.0 tNutrition, metabolism, and cardiovascular diseases.g2021 Feb. 08, v. 31, no. 2 p.403-410dElsevier B.V.aThe Italian Diabetes Society, the Italian Society for the Study of Atherosclerosis, the Italian Society of Human Nutrition and the Department of Clinical Medicine and Surgery, Federico II UniversitywJournal:11953x0939-47537nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.numecd.2020.09.0223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02996naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245014600167300001800313500001400331520118400345592002801529596011101557596011101668596010801779650001901887650001801906650001801924650001001942650001101952650002501963650001401988650002102002650001802023650001302041650002602054653002902080653002002109653002302129653001002152653002902162700001602191700001602207700001602223700001802239773013902257856008502396852000902481655001202490IND60692777520221118223440.0200503e20161002xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069277752DNAL7 a10.1080/09168451.2016.11941782doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Jing10aSomatic embryogenesis and direct as well as indirect organogenesis in Lilium pumilum DC.

In organogenesis, the highest shoot regeneration frequency (92.5%) was obtained directly from bulb scales on Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium containing 2.0¬†mg¬†L‚Åª¬π BA and 0.2¬†mg¬†L‚Åª¬π NAA, while organogenic callus (OC) formed from leaves on MS medium supplemented with 1.0¬†mg¬†L‚Åª¬π BA and 0.5¬†mg¬†L‚Åª¬π NAA. Following subculture, 76.7% of OC regenerated shoots. In somatic embryogenesis, the combination of picloram and NAA increased the amount of embryogenic callus (EC) that formed with a maximum on 90.7% of all explants which formed 11 somatic embryos (SEs) per explant. Differences between EC and OC in cellular morphology and cell differentiation fate were easily observed. SEs initially formed via an exogenous or an endogenous origin. The appearance of a protoderm in heart-shaped SE and the bipolar shoot‚Äìroot development in oval-shaped SE indicated true somatic embryogenesis. This protocol provides a new and detailed regulation and histological examination of regeneration pattern in L. pumilum.  aPublisher supplied data  agrant number 31471897cNational Natural Science Foundation of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001809  agrant number 31171981cNational Natural Science Foundation of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001809  agrant number LR2013029cthe Program for Excellent Talents in the University of Liaoning province, China 3aLilium pumilum 3abenzyladenine 3abiotechnology 3abulbs 3acallus 3acell differentiation 3ahistology 3amedicinal plants 3aorganogenesis 3apicloram 3asomatic embryogenesis 0aLilium pumilum DC.

In order to verify the folkloric assertion, the female and male flowers inflorescences were individually submitted to in vivo wound models. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Ointment formulations prepared directly either from the male or female flowers inflorescences of Typha domingensis in 5% and 10% concentrations were submitted to activity testing. After that, female flowers inflorescence was further submitted to successive extractions with solvents in increasing polarity; i.e., n-hexane, chloroform, methanol and water and the wound healing activity of each extract was investigated. The linear incision and circular excision wound models were used for the evaluation of the healing potential of the test materials in rats and mice. Tissue sections were also evaluated by histopathological techniques. RESULTS: Remarkable wound healing activity was observed only for the female flowers inflorescence at 5% concentration in ointment base and its methanolic and aqueous extracts. The wound healing effect was found comparable to that of reference ointment Madecassol¬Æ. The results of histopathological evaluation supported the outcome of both linear incision and circular excision wound models. CONCLUSION: The experimental study revealed that the female flowers inflorescence of Typha domingensis displayed notable wound healing activity in mice and rats, at the models tested.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTypha domingensis 3achloroform 3aexcision 3afemale flowers 3ahistopathology 3amale flowers 3amethanol 3amice 3amodels 3aointments 3arats 3asolvents 3atissue repair 3atraditional medicine 2aAnimals 2aFlowersxchemistry 2aMice 2aPlant Extractsxpharmacology 2aRats 2aRats, Sprague-Dawley 2aTyphaceaexchemistry 2aWound Healingxdrug effects1 aS√ºntar, Ipek1 aKeles, Hikmet1 aYesilada, Erdem0 tJournal of ethnopharmacology.g2011 Feb. 16, v. 133, no. 3 p.1027-1032dElsevier Ireland Ltdx0378-87417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jep.2010.11.0363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02456naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002200142245008200164500001900246520135200265592002801617650002001645650002901665650003501694650002001729650001101749650003501760650001701795650002001812650001701832700002501849773015901874856007602033852000902109655001202118IND60738786520221123013409.0210524e20210503xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073878652DNAL7 a10.3390/ijgi100502912doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlbraheem, Lamya 10aGeospatial Analysis of Solar Energy in Riyadh Using a GIS-AHP-Based Technique  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aIn recent years, spatial multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) has been applied to different types of spatial problems, such as solar power site suitability. MCDA can be used to support the process of identifying suitable regions for solar energy projects. To the best of our knowledge, no study has addressed the problem of site evaluation for solar photovoltaic PV systems in the Riyadh region. Therefore, a spatial MCDA framework is proposed to perform a geospatial analysis of solar energy in the Riyadh region, which includes data collection, spatial analysis, a spatial decision support system and visualization. The methodology that was used to solve the site suitability problem is described. It involved the combination of a Geographical Information System (GIS) and the Analytic Hierarchy Process (GIS-AHP). The results show that the most suitable sites are in the north and northwest of the Riyadh region, with an area that represents 16,748 Km¬≤ with an 80% suitability degree. In addition, it was proven that Afif is the largest suitable city. It has high solar radiation, at an average of 2.631687 MWh/m¬≤/year, and low temperatures, at an average of 26.3 ¬∞C, as well as having flat areas with a slope under 5¬∞. The results were validated using a sensitivity analysis model and also compared with those for ground-based stations.  aPublisher supplied data 3adata collection 3adecision support systems 3ageographic information systems 3aland evaluation 3amodels 3amulti-criteria decision making 3asolar energy 3asolar radiation 3aspatial data1 aAlabdulkarim, Leena 0 tISPRS international journal of geo-information.g2021 May 03, v. 10, no. 5dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21619x2220-99647nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijgi100502913Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02028naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100003100143245009000174520101800264592002801282650001701310650001801327650001601345650001701361650001801378650001301396650001301409700002801422700002101450700002601471773011901497856007701616852000901693655001201702IND60742533220221117012703.0210624e20210607xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074253322DNAL7 a10.3390/foods100613082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBragagnolo, Felipe Sanchez10aMetabolomics as a Tool to Study Underused Soy Parts: In Search of Bioactive Compounds  aThe valorization of agri-food by-products is essential from both economic and sustainability perspectives. The large quantity of such materials causes problems for the environment; however, they can also generate new valuable ingredients and products which promote beneficial effects on human health. It is estimated that soybean production, the major oilseed crop worldwide, will leave about 597 million metric tons of branches, leaves, pods, and roots on the ground post-harvesting in 2020/21. An alternative for the use of soy-related by-products arises from the several bioactive compounds found in this plant. Metabolomics studies have already identified isoflavonoids, saponins, and organic and fatty acids, among other metabolites, in all soy organs. The present review aims to show the application of metabolomics for identifying high-added-value compounds in underused parts of the soy plant, listing the main bioactive metabolites identified up to now, as well as the factors affecting their production.  aPublisher supplied data 3ahuman health 3aisoflavonoids 3ametabolites 3ametabolomics 3aoilseed crops 3asaponins 3asoybeans1 aFunari, Cristiano Soleo1 aIb√°√±ez, Elena,1 aCifuentes, Alejandro 0 tFoods.g2021 June 07, v. 10, no. 6dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21651x2304-81587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/foods100613083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02661naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245006500165300001400230520142800244592002801672650001901700650003101719650002201750650002201772650002401794650001101818650001101829650002101840650001901861650001501880653001901895653001701914653003001931653001801961653001901979700002501998700003102023773009302054856008302147852000902230655001202239IND60679294120221123040524.0210213e20191218xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067929412DNAL7 a10.1515/mammalia-2018-01912doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPahad, Govan10aPhylogeography and niche modelling: reciprocal enlightenment  ap. 10-25.  aPhylogeography examines the spatial genetic structure of species. Environmental niche modelling (or ecological niche modelling; ENM) examines the environmental limits of a species‚Äô ecological niche. These two fields have great potential to be used together. ENM can shed light on how phylogeographical patterns develop and help identify possible drivers of spatial structure that need to be further investigated. Specifically, ENM can be used to test for niche differentiation among clades, identify factors limiting individual clades and identify barriers and contact zones. It can also be used to test hypotheses regarding the effects of historical and future climate change on spatial genetic patterns by projecting niches using palaeoclimate or future climate data. Conversely, phylogeographical information can populate ENM with within-species genetic diversity. Where adaptive variation exists among clades within a species, modelling their niches separately can improve predictions of historical distribution patterns and future responses to climate change. Awareness of patterns of genetic diversity in niche modelling can also alert conservationists to the potential loss of genetically diverse areas in a species‚Äô range. Here, we provide a simplistic overview of both fields, and focus on their potential for integration, encouraging researchers on both sides to take advantage of the opportunities available.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimate change 3aecological differentiation 3agenetic structure 3agenetic variation 3ameteorological data 3amodels 3aniches 3apaleoclimatology 3aphylogeography 3aprediction 0aclimate change 0aconservation 0aenvironmental niche model 0apalaeoecology 0aphylogeography1 aMontgelard, Claudine1 aJansen van Vuuren, Bettine0 tMammalia.g2019 Dec. 18, v. 84, no. 1 p.10-25dDe GruyterwJournal:1950x1864-15477nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1515/mammalia-2018-01913Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01494naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001300140245008900153300002000242520036900262592002800631650001200659650002700671650002300698650001400721650001300735650001900748650001400767650002000781650001400801700001500815700002600830700002100856700002300877773013600900856007501036852000901111655001201120IND60659065820221123041708.0190827e20110830xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065906582DNAL7 a10.1039/c1cc13787e2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Gan,10aAnodic properties of diarylethene derivatives having organometallic piano-stool tags  ap. 10109-10111.  aThe half-sandwich tamoxifen derivative, Mn(CO)‚ÇÉ(Œ∑‚Åµ-C‚ÇÖH‚ÇÑ(Et)CÓÄÅC(C‚ÇÜH‚ÇÖ)‚ÇÇ), gives a radical cation which is charge-delocalized between the ‚Äúcymantrenyl‚Äù and diphenylethene moieties and undergoes facile metal-carbonyl substitution reactions.

He made an excursion to the Sundarbans (the Ganges-Brahmaputra delta) of Bangladesh, where on 17 November 1828 his team shot a female rhinoceros and caught her young one the next day, just south of Khulna. Both animals were completely hornless. He returned to France in the spring of 1830, where his zoological specimens were assessed by Georges Cuvier, and his other collections relating to ethnography by other scholars. All recommended purchase by the French Government, but circumstances did not allow this. A few animals were described by scientists connected with the Natural History Museum in Paris. After Lamare-Picquot published an account of the hunting expedition in 1835, the rhinoceros was described as a new species Rhinoceros inermis, by Ren√©-Primiv√®re Lesson, first in a supplement to Buffon dated 1836, and not, as accepted until now, in restatements dating from 1838 or later. The main part of the zoological collection was bought by the Prussian King Friedrich Wilhelm III in 1836 and integrated in museums in Berlin. Other collections were exhibited as a ‚ÄúPanth√©on Indien‚Äù in Vienna and Bratislava from 1838, until they were purchased by the Bavarian King Ludwig in 1841, and added to a museum in Munich. The type specimens of R. inermis are still preserved in the Museum f√ºr Naturkunde in Berlin. The adult female (ZMB_Mam_1957) was selected as the lectotype.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRhinoceros 3aadults 3aanimals 3aanthropology 3afemales 3alectotypes 3amuseums 3anew species 3ariver deltas 3aspring 3aBangladesh 0aBerlin Museum f√ºr Naturkunde 0aexploration 0ahunting 0aKing of Bavaria 0aKing of Prussia 0aPeters 0aSclater0 tMammalia.g2019 Dec. 18, v. 84, no. 1 p.74-89dDe GruyterwJournal:1950x1864-15477nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1515/mammalia-2018-02003Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01960naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100006100140245010500201300001500306500002000321520073700341592002801078650001801106650001601124650001201140650001301152650001001165650001301175650001101188650001701199700002201216700002001238700002001258700002301278700002401301700001901325773013401344856007501478852000901553655001201562IND60791227920221118043704.0220826e202003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079122792DNAL7 a10.1002/ame2.121002doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, Alexander Y.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1056-494510aSuitability of the woodchuck HCC as a preclinical model for evaluation of intra‚Äêarterial therapies  ap. 98-102.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe most commonly used preclinical models of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are limited for use in testing of intra‚Äêarterial therapies such as transarterial chemoembolization and radioembolization. Issues encountered with the more commonly used animal models include dissimilarity in their disease development compared with humans and the size of the vasculature which can make intra‚Äêarterial therapy testing difficult or impossible. Here we describe the suitability of the woodchuck HCC model for testing of intra‚Äêarterial therapies.

In addition, the antibacterial and cytotoxic properties of recombinant azurin in the culture supernatant were also investigated. Azurin gene from Pseudomonas aeruginosa was cloned into the pNZ8149 vector and the resulting recombinant DNA was transformed into food grade L. lactis NZ3900. The expression of azurin protein was induced by the optimum concentration of nisin for 3‚Äâh. Inhibition zones for Escherichia coli and Bacillus cereus were observed at 5.0 and 10‚Äâmg/mL concentrations of lyophilized supernatants containing azurin, but no inhibition zone at azurin-free lyophilized supernatants. When HUVEC, HT29, HCT116, and MCF7 cell lines were treated with lyophilized culture supernatants with azurin or without azurin, cell viability decreased with increasing concentrations of the supernatant. Furthermore, the supernatants containing azurin showed more anti-proliferative effect than the azurin-free supernatants. This work provides a practicable method to produce recombinant azurin in the food grade L. lactis strain. As a result, the recombinant L. lactis strain, producing azurin, can be used in the investigation of food biopreservatives and in the development of a therapeutic probiotic.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillus cereus 3aEscherichia coli 3aLactococcus lactis 3aPseudomonas aeruginosa 3aantineoplastic activity 3abiotechnology 3acell viability 3acytotoxicity 3afood biopreservatives 3afreeze drying 3agene expression 3agenes 3aheterologous gene expression 3anisin 3aprobiotics 3arecombinant DNA 3atherapeutics 0aBacterial protein 0acloning 0aNICE expression system 0arecombinant product1 aAskin, Hakan0 tPreparative biochemistry & biotechnology.g2019 Sept. 14, v. 49, no. 8 p.800-806dTaylor & FranciswJournal:12249x1532-22977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10826068.2019.16218943Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03105naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100003200140245013800172300001800310520146700328592002801795650002101823650001901844650002801863650001401891650001401905650001601919650001901935650001901954650001001973650001701983650002602000650001102026650002502037650002302062650001702085650002702102650001902129650002302148650002702171650002202198650001302220650002802233700002802261700002202289700002602311700003002337773012502367856007402492852000902566655001202575IND60639957320221119052207.0190503e20171115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063995732DNAL7 a10.1039/c7fo00263g2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLe√≥n-Gonz√°lez, Antonio J.10aRole of epigenetic regulation on the induction of apoptosis in Jurkat leukemia cells by white grape pomace rich in phenolic compounds  ap. 4062-4069.  aGrape pomace is a rich source of phenolic compounds commonly employed for elaboration of dietary supplements. The aim of the present study was to investigate the anticancer effect of a purified white grape pomace extract (PWGPE) in acute lymphoblastic leukemia Jurkat cells and to characterize the underlying mechanism. Apoptosis, mitochondrial membrane potential and reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels were assessed by flow cytometry and protein expression levels were analysed by Western blotting. PWGPE induced apoptosis in Jurkat cells in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. The anticancer effect was associated with an increased expression of p73 and down-regulation of pro-survival factors, including p-Akt, Bcl-2, and survivin. PWGPE reduced the expression of several proteins that block the expression of apoptosis-related genes such as DNMT1, HDAC1/2, UHRF1, and the polycomb group protein members: EZH2, SUZ12, and BMI1. In addition, the extract induced the formation of ROS, whereas pre-treatment with PEG-catalase and N-acetylcysteine prevented the ROS formation and markedly decreased the induction of apoptosis. These findings suggest that PWGPE-induced apoptosis in Jurkat human leukemia cells, is mediated by mitochondrial depolarization and caspase-3 cleavage, and depends on ROS generation and regulation of epigenetic gene silencing. Therefore, PWGPE may play an important role in the treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL).  aPublisher supplied data 3aWestern blotting 3aacetylcysteine 3aantineoplastic activity 3aapoptosis 3acaspase-3 3aepigenetics 3aflow cytometry 3agene silencing 3agenes 3agrape pomace 3agrape pomace extracts 3ahumans 3alymphocytic leukemia 3amembrane potential 3amitochondria 3amitochondrial membrane 3aneoplasm cells 3aphenolic compounds 3apro-apoptotic proteins 3aprotein synthesis 3aproteins 3areactive oxygen species1 aJara-Palacios, M.

Smad2/3 transcription factor plays a central role in differentiation and survival of erythroid cells. Here we report that follistatin-like 1 (FSTL1) treatment impairs hemin-induced erythroid differentiation and cell survival. FSTL1 differentially regulates transforming growth factor beta (TGF-Œ≤) and bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling. Blockade of Smad2/3 signaling with the ALK5/type I TGF-Œ≤R kinase inhibitor, SB-525334, was efficacious for rescue of erythroid differentiation blockage and apoptosis. Reversely, activation of Smad1/5/8 signaling with BMP4 cannot rescue FSTL1-mediated erythroid differentiation blockage and apoptosis. Collectively, these data provide mechanistic insight into the regulation of erythropoiesis by FSTL1 signaling and lay a foundation for exploring FSTL1 signaling as a therapeutic target for anemia.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanemia 3aapoptosis 3abone morphogenetic proteins 3acell differentiation 3acell viability 3aerythropoiesis 3atranscription factors 3atransforming growth factor beta 0aErythropoiesis 0aErythroid cells 0aDifferentiation 0aCell survival 0aFSTL1 0aSmad2/3 0aBMP 0aDMEM 0aPCR 0aPE 0aqRT-PCR 0aTGF1 aDong, Yingying1 aTeng, Xiaomei1 aCheng, Maohua1 aShen, Zhenya1 aChen, Weiqian0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2015 Oct. 30, v. 466 p.711-716dElsevier Inc.x0006-291X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2015.09.0443Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02749naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001200148245009700160300001100257520131900268592002801587650002701615650002701642650001701669650001901686650002601705650000901731650002001740650001301760650002901773650002601802650001201828650000901840650002001849650002401869650001301893650001801906700001301924700001401937700005501951700001802006700001702024700001602041773011802057856008302175852000902258655001202267IND60699489420221119195647.0201204e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069948942DNAL7 a10.1186/s13717-020-00239-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCui, Hu10aAggregate-related microbial communities and nutrient stoichiometry under different croplands  ap. 33.  aEcological stoichiometry is an important indicator presenting multiple elements balance in agro-ecosystems. However, information on microbial communities and nutrient stoichiometry in soil aggregate fractions under different croplands (rice, maize, and soybean fields) remains limited. Thus, this study investigated water-stable aggregate structure and their internal nutrient stoichiometry under different croplands and ascertain their interaction mechanism with microbial communities. The results showed that no significant difference on the carbon-to-nitrogen ratio (C:N) in soil aggregate fractions was observed, while the carbon-to-phosphorus ratio (C:P) and the nitrogen-to-phosphorus ratio (N:P) were ranked as rice field > maize field > soybean field, and were higher in mega-aggregates (ME, > 1‚Äâmm). General fatty acid methyl ester (FAME), Gram-positive bacteria (G‚Å∫), and Gram-negative bacteria (G‚Åª) were predominant microbial communities in all croplands and tented to condense into coarse-aggregates. Redundancy analysis (RDA) demonstrated that N:P ratio was primary environmental controls on the distribution of soil microorganisms. In the Sanjiang Plain, N was the nutrient element limiting agro-ecosystem productivity, and rice cultivation is expected to improve the N-limited nutrient status.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGram-negative bacteria 3aGram-positive bacteria 3aOryza sativa 3aagroecosystems 3acarbon nitrogen ratio 3acorn 3acrop production 3acropland 3afatty acid methyl esters 3amicrobial communities 3apaddies 3arice 3asoil aggregates 3asoil microorganisms 3asoybeans 3astoichiometry1 aOu, Yang1 aLv, Duian1 aWang, Lixia1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1761-18661 aLiang, Aizhen1 aYan, Baixing1 aLi, Yingxin0 tEcological processes.g2020 Dec., v. 9, no. 1 p.33-33dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:22887x2192-17097nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13717-020-00239-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02446naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245013000170300001300300520121800313592002801531650002301559650002001582650001901602650001601621650001401637650002901651650002001680650000901700650001701709650001001726650001101736653001301747653001201760653002101772653001801793653003001811700002401841773009901865856005101964852000902015655001202024IND50087102820221119092610.0140412e20120101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008710282DNAL7 a10.1080/09593330.2010.4835992doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNabi, Md.

Ten per cent by volume of Fischer‚ÄìTropsch (FT), a synthetic diesel fuel, was added to MGO to investigate its influence on the diesel engine performance and emissions. The blended fuel was termed as FT10 fuel, while the neat (100 vol%) MGO was termed as MGO fuel. The experiments were conducted with a fourstroke, six-cylinder, turbocharged, direct injection, Scania DC 1102 diesel engine. It is interesting to note that all emissions including smoke (filter smoke number), total particulate matter (TPM), carbon monoxide (CO), total unburned hydrocarbon (THC), oxides of nitrogen (NOx) and engine noise were reduced with FT10 fuel compared with the MGO fuel. Diesel fine particle number and mass emissions were measured with an electrical low pressure impactor. Like other exhaust emissions, significant reductions in fine particles and mass emissions were observed with the FT10 fuel. The reduction was due to absence of sulphur and aromatic compounds in the FT fuel. In-cylinder gas pressure and engine thermal efficiency were identical for both FT10 and MGO fuels.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaromatic compounds 3acarbon monoxide 3adiesel engines 3adiesel fuel 3aemissions 3aenvironmental technology 3anitrogen oxides 3aoils 3aparticulates 3asmoke 3asulfur 0aMGO fuel 0aFT fuel 0adiesel emissions 0afine particle 0aengine thermal efficiency1 aHustad, Johan Einar0 tEnvironmental technology.g2012 Jan. 1, v. 33, no. 1 p.9-15dTaylor & Francisx1479-487X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09593330.2010.483599  aDNAL 7aarticle03063naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001500148245011600163300001800279520161600297592002801913596009801941596009402039650001502133650001502148650002202163650001202185650002002197650001502217650002602232650001402258650000702272650001102279650002302290650001502313700005602328700001402384773016302398856008302561852000902644655001202653IND60777745320221120061248.0220520e202206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077774532DNAL7 a10.1007/s13762-021-03326-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRanjan, S.10aRemoval of arsenic (III and V) from aqueous solution using stable maghemite (Œ≥ -Fe2O3) loaded pumice composite  ap. 4737-4748.  aThe maghemite (Œ≥-Fe‚ÇÇO‚ÇÉ) loaded pumice composite (P-maghemite) was prepared through the chemical co-precipitation method by refluxing the Fe¬≤‚Å∫ and Fe¬≥‚Å∫ salts in an alkaline medium in presence of the base material pumice. A series of batch experiments were conducted first to study the effect of varying experimental conditions, viz contact time, pH, and initial arsenic concentration, on the removal efficiency of As(III) and As(V) by the developed composite. For both the species of arsenic, the removal was found significantly higher at lower pH and reduced precipitously after pH‚Äâ>‚Äâ7. The adsorption process of As(III) and As(V) was well illustrated by the pseudo-second-order kinetics and Langmuir isotherm. The maximum adsorption capacity was observed as 30.36 and 33.21¬†mg/g of the adsorbent for As(III) and As(V), respectively. The developed composite was then assessed for its regeneration by repeated cycles of sorption and desorption with 0.1¬†M NaOH. Regeneration efficiency of 94.10% was observed for the developed P-maghemite after three cycles of (de)-sorption. A long term continuous column experiment was then conducted with arsenic laden aqueous water using a 20¬†cm uniformly packed vertical column having an inner diameter of 4.5¬†cm. More than 99% removal of arsenic was observed using the 30¬†days breakthrough curves (BTCs), which corresponds to the 0.76¬†mg/g of arsenic adsorption on the developed adsorbent. The findings of this study ascertain that the developed composite, P-maghemite, presents a great removal potential of arsenic in mixed and continuous flow systems.  aPublisher supplied data  aDST/TM/WTI/2K15/118cDepartment of Science and Technology, Ministry of Science and Technology  aDST-NERC 003386cDepartment of Science and Technology, Ministry of Science and Technology 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3aaqueous solutions 3aarsenic 3acoprecipitation 3adesorption 3aenvironmental science 3amaghemite 3apH 3apumice 3asorption isotherms 3atechnology1 aYadav, B.

It is better to find new a automatic feeder saving pellets from crushing and cohesion without hitting pellets during feeding at a predetermined interval of time and an accurate amount of food with a larger surface area covered by pellets. Developing-country fish farmers use manual feeding to be more cost-effective than with costly mechanized feeding, so this research aimed to design and construct an automatic fish feeder prototype to feed tilapia in a recirculation aquaculture system‚Äôs tank. The performance of the prototype was studied after it was designed and installed. The dispensed feed operated by a DC motor located underneath the pellet hopper and the feed material was discharged into the tank through a gate in the bottom of the feeder. Three pellet sizes, three rotation speeds, and three feeder heights from the water‚Äôs surface were used to test the automatic feeder‚Äôs efficiency. The results showed that the optimal speed for the automatic feeder was 14 rpm with a height of 70 cm, resulting in a distribution width of 26.6 cm and a high automatic feeder efficiency of 99.9%. Furthermore, the feeder used very little electricity and saved time, cost, labor, energy, and pellets.  aPublisher supplied data 3acohesion 3acost effectiveness 3adeveloping countries 3aelectricity 3aenergy 3afish 3alabor 3amechanization 3aprototypes 3arecirculating aquaculture systems 3asurface area1 aEl Sheikh, Faisal Mohamed1 aElsbaay, Atef Mohamed0 tFishes.g2021 Dec. 06, v. 6, no. 4dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27137x2410-38887nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/fishes60400743Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02779naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100004000140245017100180300001400351500002000365520147700385592002801862650001901890650001201909650001401921650001301935650001401948650001601962700003201978700003002010700002602040700002502066700002002091700003502111700003002146773013302176856007502309852000902384655001202393IND60791228220221118043824.0220826e202003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079122822DNAL7 a10.1002/ame2.120992doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPessini, Patrick Gabriel dos Santos10aHematological reference values and animal welfare parameters of BALB/C‚ÄêFMABC (Mus musculus) inoculated with Ehrlich tumor kept in the vivarium at ABC Medical School  ap. 32-39.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aBACKGROUND: Biochemical and hematological parameters are important tools for assessing the physiological profile of vital organs, and can be recorded to create reference values used for clinical diagnosis of diseases. Many research laboratories lack the means to establish their own set of reference parameters for use in their research, and while there are articles in the literature that discuss laboratory parameters for healthy BALB/c mice, few studies address the evaluation of these parameters in pathological situations, such as in mice inoculated with Ehrlich tumor. METHOD: BALB/c‚ÄêFMABC mice previously inoculated with Ehrlich tumor were maintained under appropriate conditions. Blood samples were taken for analysis of hematological parameters using automated and semi‚Äêautomated equipment to create a set of the animal welfare parameters for evaluation. RESULT: Results were obtained for all the hematological parameters for all groups analyzed. These showed: statistically significant differences between the initial and final tumor weight; comparable initial tumour volume and weight; an increase in leukocytes in the 7‚Äêday group with a characteristic predominance of lymphocytes and neutrophils; statistically significant changes in RDW in the 21‚Äêday group and in the welfare parameters in the 28‚Äêday group. CONCLUSION: The study successfully defined and established reference values for hematological and welfare parameters for all groups analyzed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal welfare 3aanimals 3aequipment 3amedicine 3aneoplasms 3aneutrophils1 aKnox de Souza, Paula Regina1 aChagas, Camila dos Santos1 aSampaio, Emily Garcia1 aNeves, Daniel Santos1 aPetri, Giuliana1 aFonseca, Fernando Luiz Affonso1 ada Silva, Emerson Barbosa0 tAnimal models and experimental medicine.g2020 Mar., v. 3, no. 1 p.32-39dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:28349x2576-20957nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ame2.120993Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02759naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245012500167300001600292520174700308592002802055650001502083650001602098650001002114650001602124650001902140650001502159650001002174650002002184650001602204651001102220651001902231773009902250856005102349852000902400655001202409IND50088088820221117233516.0140412e20130801xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008808882DNAL7 a10.1080/2150704X.2013.7987072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOhde, Thomas10aSpectral effects of atmospheric dust and clouds on estimation of chlorophyll-a concentration from radiation measurements  ap. 774-782.  aAtmospheric dust and clouds modify the spectral distribution of the incident solar radiation. The influence of these spectral effects on the determination of chlorophyll-a concentration from the sea surface and remotely sensed radiation measurements made from ships, aircrafts or satellites was studied in the region off Northwest Africa in the Atlantic Ocean. The chlorophyll-a algorithms that are typically used in ocean colour community are based on ratios of reflectance values of different wavelengths. This fact, together with the wavelength dependent effect of atmospheric dust and clouds, causes uncertainties in the estimation of chlorophyll-a concentration. The most frequently used Morel, OC4v4 and OC3M chlorophyll-a algorithms were included in the investigation. The highest and the smallest uncertainties were found for the Morel and the OC3M algorithms, respectively. For the first time, sky conditions with dust and clouds together in the atmosphere were studied. Overestimations of the chlorophyll-a concentration of up to 8.8% were observed in the case of dusty skies without clouds. The concentration was also overestimated between 7.6% and 14.3% for skies with mixtures of dust and clouds increasing the solar irradiance. Underestimations of up to 24.1% and overestimations of up to 12.2% were found for skies with mixtures of dust and clouds decreasing the solar irradiance. Compensations of the influences of spectral effects were observed at special ratios of clouds to dust. Earlier results in relation to the impact of clouds on the estimation of chlorophyll-a concentration were verified. The spectral effects of cloudy skies cannot be neglected because it may result in an error of up to 40% of the estimated value.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3achlorophyll 3acolor 3areflectance 3aremote sensing 3asatellites 3aships 3asolar radiation 3awavelengths 3aAfrica 3aAtlantic Ocean0 tRemote sensing letters.g2013 Aug. 1, v. 4, no. 8 p.774-782dTaylor & Francisx2150-70587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/2150704X.2013.798707  aDNAL 7aarticle02422naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002300142245008300165500001900248520135600267592002801623650002401651650002201675650002301697650001301720650001501733650001701748650001201765700002201777700001901799700002201818773015901840856007601999852000902075655001202084IND60738787020221123013501.0210524e20210504xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073878702DNAL7 a10.3390/ijgi100502962doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBolkas, Dimitrios 10aSurveying Reality (SurReal): Software to Simulate Surveying in Virtual Reality  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aExperiential learning through outdoor labs is an integral component of surveying education. Cancelled labs as a result of weather, the inability to visit a wide variety of terrain location, recent distance education requirements create significant instructional challenges. In this paper, we present a software solution called surveying reality (SurReal); this software allows for students to conduct immersive and interactive virtual reality labs. This paper discusses the development of a virtual differential leveling lab. The developed software faithfully replicates major steps followed in the field and any skills learned in virtual reality are transferable in the physical world. Furthermore, this paper presents a novel technique for leveling multi-legged objects like a tripod on variable terrain. This method relies solely on geometric modeling and does not require physical simulation of the tripod. This increases efficiency and ensures that the user experiences at least 60 frames per second, thus reducing lagging and creating a pleasant experience for the user. We conduct two leveling examples, a three-benchmark loop and a point-to-point leveling line. Both surveys had a misclosure of 1 mm due to observational random errors, which demonstrated that leveling can be conducted with mm-level precision, much like in the physical world.  aPublisher supplied data 3acomputer simulation 3acomputer software 3adistance education 3ageometry 3alandscapes 3aspatial data 3aweather1 aChiampi, Jeffrey 1 aFioti, Joseph 1 aGaffney, Donovan 0 tISPRS international journal of geo-information.g2021 May 04, v. 10, no. 5dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21619x2220-99647nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijgi100502963Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02501naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002200143245021500165300001600380520112600396592002801522650001201550650001201562650002301574650001001597650001101607650001601618650004401634650001401678653002301692653002901715653001601744653002401760700001601784700001801800700002001818700001701838773015001855856007702005852000902082655001202091IND60522247220221122060011.0160602e20140602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052224722DNAL7 a10.1515/znb-2004-04082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aK√ºhn, Christiane10a1,4,5,8-Tetraazafulvalene ‚Äì Darstellung schwefelhaltiger Derivate und Zuordnung des Chromophors / 1,4,5,8-Tetraazafulvalenes ‚Äì Synthesis of Sulfur-Containing Derivatives and Classification of the Chromophor  ap. 406-413.  aIn order to obtain sulfur-containing tetraazafulvalenes the derivatives 1 - 3 were cross-coupled with different types of acetylenes via palladium-catalyzed reactions. Starting from the tetrabromoaryl derivative 3a, four bromine atoms could be replaced by 2-ethynylthiophene. Under analogous conditions, the methylsulfanyl esters 7 -11 could be obtained by employing 4-ethynylbenzoic acid 4-(methylsulfanyl)butylester 6. Lipoic acid could be integrated into tetraazafulvalenes successfully in a two step reaction. First, the Sonogashira coupling method yielded the compound 12 possessing two (4-anilino)ethynyl residues which were then condensed with lipoic acid to give derivative 13. Whereas the NMR data suggest the predominance of prototropic form A, UV/vis spectra of the deeply colored tetraazafulvalenes are in favor with structure B rather than with structure A. DFT calculations at the B3LYP/6-31G(d) level showed that tautomeric form B is about 60 kJ/mol more stable than A. In addition, time-dependent density functional theory calculations support the substructure of two crossed diazaheptamethinemerocyanines.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalkynes 3abromine 3acatalytic activity 3acolor 3aesters 3alipoic acid 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3apalladium 0aTetraazafulvalenes 0aCross-Coupling Reactions 0aLipoic Acid 0aChromophoric System1 aBeckert, R.1 aGrummt, U.-W.1 aK√§pplinger, C.1 aBirckner, E.0 tZeitschrift f√ºr Naturforschung.g2014 June 2, v. 59, no. 4 p.406-413dVerlag der Zeitschrift f√ºr NaturforschungwJournal:23182x0932-07767nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1515/znb-2004-04083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02480naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245013700167300001800304520120700322592002801529650001301557650001901570650001201589650001601601650002601617650001701643650001201660650001901672650001301691650001601704650001801720700002901738700002301767700001801790700001901808773016301827856008301990852000902073655001202082IND60777745520221120061251.0220520e202206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077774552DNAL7 a10.1007/s13762-021-03385-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aManojkumar, P.10aEffect of physiological and morphological response of Musa acuminata under stress condition with different salinity levels using IoT  ap. 5227-5238.  aSalinity represents one of the most abiotic stress factors affecting plant growth and production around the world. In this experiment, in vitro multiplication of Musa acuminata has been standardized. The physiological and morphological responses of the crop against salt stress have been identified. To study the effects of salicylic acid (SA) and abscisic acid (ABA) on salt stress in banana (Musa acuminata), the explants were treated with varying SA and ABA concentrations and incubated on MS media having various concentrations (0, 50, 100, 150, 200, 250, 300 mM) of NaCl in vitro; hence, their physiological and morphological responses were identified. Two months after, propagation rate, rise of fresh weight, comparative water content, chlorophyll level and proline accumulations were estimated and examined. The outcomes demonstrated that with developing degrees of NaCl, spread rate, new weight, relative water substance and chlorophyll were intriguingly diminished. Use of SA and ABA assisted with impacts of salt insufficiency on banana recovers in vitro and in vivo condition. This work includes image processing and Internet of Things to screen the plant and to gather the natural factors.  aPublisher supplied data 3aInternet 3aMusa acuminata 3abananas 3achlorophyll 3aenvironmental science 3aplant growth 3aproline 3asalicylic acid 3asalinity 3asalt stress 3awater content1 aDheepanchakkravarthy, A.1 aKumar, P.

These challenges, combined with the rapid development of 3D technologies, have forced the research and progress of 3D cadastre systems. The aim of this study is to investigate how a Building Information Model (BIM) can be used as a data source for the Land Administration Domain Model (LADM) based 3D cadastre system, and how that process can be improved. The Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) format and the LADM-based model were selected because both are international open standards that have a significant impact in their own domain. The data sample for the 3D cadastre system was extracted from a BIM model. The paper proposes an IFC format extension which makes it possible to define 3D geometry according to the LADM standard. In order to demonstrate this extension, the West 65 residential and business complex, Belgrade, was selected as a case study. The IFC format extension presented here is a step towards data harmonization between BIM in the IFC format and 3D cadastre systems; it should provide more suitable data in the current IFC schema and enable easy data flow between BIM projects and 3D cadastral data.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase studies 3ageometry 3aindustry 3aland management 3amodels 3aspatial data1 aVi≈°njevac, Nenad 1 aPra≈°ƒçeviƒá, Nata≈°a 1 aBajat, Branislav 0 tISPRS international journal of geo-information.g2021 May 05, v. 10, no. 5dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21619x2220-99647nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijgi100502973Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02300naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245009500166300001600261520141900277592002801696650001201724650001501736650005001751650001501801650001601816650001901832773009901851856005101950852000902001655001202010IND50088089020221117233559.0140412e20130801xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008808902DNAL7 a10.1080/2150704X.2013.7987092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFlood, Neil10aTesting the local applicability of MODIS BRDF parameters for correcting Landsat TM imagery  ap. 793-802.  aLandsat Thematic Mapper (TM) imagery is widely used for large scale multi-temporal monitoring of the land surface. One source of variability in this imagery, which is not related to variation in the land surface, is the result of the bi-directional reflectance distribution function (BRDF). This causes variation in the measured reflectance as a function of the angular configuration of the sun and sensor. To remove this variation from the imagery, a correction can be applied for BRDF. Some authors have proposed the use of the BRDF parameterization derived for the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS; NASA, Washington, DC, USA) instrument as a means of correction for BRDF in Landsat TM imagery. However, since the spatial scale of the two instruments is substantially different, it is not clear up to what extent the MODIS BRDF parameters are applicable to Landsat TM. This study provides a direct empirical test of this, over the eastern Australian landscape, and tests whether the MODIS BRDF parameters are applicable to characterize BRDF at a local scale of a Landsat TM pixel, or simply at a global scale. The results suggest that the MODIS BRDF parameters effectively characterize the BRDF of the Landsat imagery at a global average scale, but, at least in the Australian context, do not capture any further information about the BRDF of more local regions, or individual Landsat pixels.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLandsat 3alandscapes 3amoderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer 3amonitoring 3areflectance 3aremote sensing0 tRemote sensing letters.g2013 Aug. 1, v. 4, no. 8 p.793-802dTaylor & Francisx2150-70587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/2150704X.2013.798709  aDNAL 7aarticle01743naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002100143245013500164300001600299520054500315592002800860650001600888650001200904650002100916650001000937650001300947653003200960653002100992653004201013653002401055700001801079700002801097700002001125773015001145856007701295852000901372655001201381IND60522247420221122055906.0160602e20140602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052224742DNAL7 a10.1515/znb-2004-04102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGirreser, Ulrich10aReactions of 3-Chloropropeniminium Salts with Aminopyridines.

The majority of these NPs' properties have been investigated for particles in solvents. Yet, most STM studies are for NPs in a dry state. Images of the same particles in air and liquid have not been obtained yet. In this work, a judicious choice of ligand molecules led to NPs with close-to-ideal STM imaging conditions in air and in 1-phenyloctane (PO). Large datasets under both conditions were acquired and rapidly evaluated through power spectral density (PSD) analysis. The result is a quantitative comparison of stripe-like domains in air and PO on the same NPs. PSD analysis determines a characteristic length-scale for these domains of ‚àº1.0 nm in air and in PO showing persistence of striped domains in these two media. A length scale of ‚àº0.7 nm for homoligand NPs was found.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3achemical reactions 3adata collection 3aimage analysis 3aligands 3aliquids 3ananogold 3ascanning tunneling microscopy 3asolvents1 aZhao, Shun1 aReguera, Javier1 aBiscarini, Fabio1 aStellacci, Francesco0 tChemical communications.g2014 Aug. 12, v. 50, no. 72 p.10456-10459dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26910x1364-548X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c4cc04114c3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02162naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100002300188245013500211300001300346506007600359520076300435592002801198506003701226650001701263650001001280650000901290650001801299650001901317650001401336650002401350700002001374700001801394700002101412700001801433700002501451700002001476700002201496700002201518773008601540856008101626852000901707655001201716IND60338761720221207144459.0150729e20140513xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6033876172DNAL7 a10.1126/scisignal.20052612doi7 aPMC41382192pmcid7 a248259192pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMorton, Stephen W.12aA Nanoparticle-Based Combination Chemotherapy Delivery System for Enhanced Tumor Killing by Dynamic Rewiring of Signaling Pathways  ap. ra44.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aTiming the One-Two Punch Morton et al . developed a dual-drug, time-delayed nanoparticle delivery system for treating cancer. The nanoparticles contained two drugs (one in the membrane and one in the center) and were coated to target the nanoparticles to cancer cells. Cancer cells took up the nanoparticles. The first drug quickly escaped the nanoparticle, sensitizing the cells to the second drug, which escaped more slowly. In mice, tumors from cells that respond to the first drug were reduced when the mice were treated with the dual-drug nanoparticles, but the tumors continued to grow in mice receiving only single-drug therapy.

Due to the complexity of its molecular pathogenesis and the interaction of the numerous factors involved, the etiology and pathogenesis of AD have not been fully elucidated. Therefore, effective treatment for AD remains to be developed. Evodiamine, a quinolone alkaloid, has been found to improve learning and memory ability to in the APPÀ¢ ∑·µâ/PS1‚ñ≥·¥±‚Åπ mouse model of dementia. However, the cytotoxicity and physicochemical properties of evodiamine have limited its use in the treatment of AD. METHODS: Evodiamine and its derivatives were effectively synthesized by EDCI‚Äêmediated condensation at room temperature. These target compounds contained 1 thio‚Äê and 21 oxo‚Äêevodiamine derivatives with different substituted groups. The cytotoxicity of evodiamine and its derivatives and the neuroprotective effects of the evodiamine derivatives against H‚ÇÇO‚ÇÇ‚Äêinduced cell loss in SH‚ÄêSY5Y cells were investigated using the WST‚Äê8 assay. The Morris water‚Äêmaze test was used to detect the effect of evodiamine and its derivatives on improving learning and memory in APPÀ¢ ∑·µâ/PS1‚ñ≥·¥±‚Åπ mice. RESULTS: In this study, a series of oxo‚Äê and thio‚Äêevodiamine derivatives was synthesized. Several derivatives showed lower cytotoxicity and stronger neuroprotective effects than evodiamine and elicited enhanced cognitive improvement, especially in the test of spatial memory in APPÀ¢ ∑·µâ/PS1‚ñ≥·¥±‚Åπ mice. CONCLUSION: Our study provides insights for developing novel evodiamine derivatives for chemical intervention and treatment of AD.  aPublisher supplied data  a31970508cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a2018ZX09711‚Äê001‚Äê005cDrug Innovation Major Project  aCAMS‚ÄêI2McChinese Academy of Medical Sciences (CAMS) Innovation Fund for Medical Sciences  a2016‚ÄêI2M‚Äê1‚Äê004cChinese Academy of Medical Sciences (CAMS) Innovation Fund for Medical Sciences 3aAlzheimer disease 3aalkaloids 3aambient temperature 3acognition 3acytotoxicity 3aetiology 3agenetically modified organisms 3amedicine 3amice 3amodels 3aneurodegenerative diseases 3apathogenesis 3aquinolones 3aspatial memory1 aSun, Caixian1 aGao, Shan1 aYang, Yajun1 aPan, Xiandao1 aZhang, Lianfeng1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5774-29240 tAnimal models and experimental medicine.g2020 June, v. 3, no. 2 p.193-199dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:28349x2576-20957nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ame2.121263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01390naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001600140245009900156300001800255520025600273592002800529650002500557650002700582650002300609650002300632650002000655650001700675650002100692650001900713650002600732700001700758700001800775700001700793773013400810856007500944852000901019655001201028IND60659066620221120030045.0190827e20110823xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065906662DNAL7 a10.1039/c1cc13819g2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, Tae-Il12aA fluorescent turn-on probe for the detection of alkaline phosphatase activity in living cells  ap. 9825-9827.  aFluorescent probe 1, showing a high fluorescence turn-on signal ratio, enables the real-time imaging of endogenous alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity in living cells, and the fast and quantitative analysis of enzyme activity at the single-cell level.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalkaline phosphatase 3achemical communication 3achemical compounds 3achemical reactions 3aenzyme activity 3afluorescence 3afluorescent dyes 3aimage analysis 3aquantitative analysis1 aKim, Hyunjin1 aChoi, Yongdoo1 aKim, Youngmi0 tChemical communications.g2011 Aug. 23, v. 47, no. 35 p.9825-9827dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26910x1364-548X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c1cc13819g3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01462naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002400144245010500168300001600273520050000289592002800789650001400817650001900831651001200850653001300862653004100875653002100916653002000937773011600957856007801073852000901151655001201160IND60679295220221120105533.0191221e20191201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067929522DNAL7 a10.2478/pjen-2019-00242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZamoroka, Andrew M.12aA new subspecies of Dorcadion fulvum (Scopoli, 1763) (Coleoptera: Cerambycidae) from western Ukraine  ap. 363-378.  aThis study provides a description of Dorcadion fulvum opillicum ssp. nov., which is the fourth subspecies of the central European species Dorcadion fulvum (Scopoli, 1763).

The shells of the invasive bivalve Corbicula fluminea were tested for their potential as a natural, abundant sorption material to cope with extremely toxic olive oil mill wastes (OOMW). Shells of C. fluminea were exposed for 14¬†days to OOMW and variations in the chemical composition of the waste and the shells were monitored by FTIR analysis. In general, the results showed the inefficacy of the shells in adsorbing chemicals from OOMW, namely regarding predominant aromatic structures. A significant slight increase in the 1750‚Äì1180¬†cm‚Åª¬π region was found, relating to a mild reduction of the peak areas in the same FTIR region noted in shells, which suggests partial shell dissolution; this trend was further supported by the parallel increase of the levels of both pH and Chemical Oxygen Demand. Although the shells of C. fluminea were found inadequate as a sink for the organic components present in OOMW, the abundance of the resource and previous evidence of its absorption capacity for different contaminants support the need for extended research on the use of this biomaterial as a sorption agent in bioremediation.  aPublisher supplied data  aUIDP/50017/2020+UIDB/50017/2020cFunda√ß√£o para a Ci√™ncia e a Tecnologia  aUIDB/05748/2020 and UIDP/05748/2020cFunda√ß√£o para a Ci√™ncia e a Tecnologia 3aCorbicula fluminea 3aabsorption 3abiocompatible materials 3abiological treatment 3abioremediation 3abiosorption 3achemical composition 3achemical oxygen demand 3aolive oil mills 3apH 3atoxicity 3awastes1 ada Costa, J.

This study evaluated the combined effect of both the herbs as an antioxidative and antihyperlipidemic agent. METHODS: Antihyperlipidemic effect was assessed in a high‚Äêfat diet‚Äêinduced hyperlipidemic model in Wistar albino rats. The rats were treated orally with extracts of bashok (J adhatoda, 200¬†mg/kg bw), tulshi (O tenuiflorum, 200¬†mg/kg bw), and a combination of bashok and tulshi (50:50), as well as with a reference drug, atorvastatin (10¬†mg/kg/day), with or without high‚Äêfat diet for 14¬†days. The antioxidative effect was studied using established in vitro models. The studies were supported by experimentally testing the effects of the extracts on membrane stabilization and inhibition of protein denaturation. RESULTS: The results showed that the serum lipid profile was significantly decreased in the different treatment groups, with bashok having the greatest effect. Body weights, total serum protein, LDH, and relative liver and adipose tissue weights were markedly restored towards baseline values, the lowest atherogenic index being achieved with the combined extract. The combination treatment significantly enhanced total phenolic content and antioxidative capacity and greatly potentiated membrane stabilization, but inhibition of protein denaturation was not significantly affected. CONCLUSION: The data demonstrate that a combination of Justicia adhatoda and Ocimum tenuiflorum could be developed as a food supplement with antioxidative and antihyperlipidemic benefits.  aPublisher supplied data  a#curespub/2016/13cChittagong University Research Cell 3aJusticia adhatoda 3aOcimum tenuiflorum 3aadipose tissue 3aalbino 3aanimals 3aantioxidant activity 3aatorvastatin 3ablood lipids 3ablood proteins 3adietary supplements 3adrugs 3ahigh fat diet 3ahyperlipidemia 3alipid composition 3aliver 3amedicine 3amodels 3aprotein denaturation 3atherapeutics1 aRahman, Md.

The physiological function of Œ±Œ≤Œ≥-ENaC is well established, but the function of Œ¥Œ≤Œ≥-ENaC remains elusive. The azo-dye Evans Blue (EvB) has been routinely used to discriminate between the two channel isoforms by decreasing transmembrane currents and amiloride-sensitive current fractions of Œ¥Œ≤Œ≥-ENaC expressing Xenopus oocytes. Even though these results could be reproduced, it was found by precipitation experiments and spectroscopic methods that the cationic amiloride and the anionic EvB directly interact in solution, forming a strong complex. Thereby a large amount of pharmacologically available amiloride is removed from physiological buffer solutions and the effective amiloride concentration is reduced. This interaction did not occur in the presence of albumin. In microelectrode recordings, EvB was able to abrogate the block of Œ¥Œ≤Œ≥-ENaC by amiloride or its derivative benzamil.In sum, EvB reduces amiloride-sensitive ion current fractions in electrophysiological experiments. This is not a result of a specific inhibition of Œ¥Œ≤Œ≥-ENaC but rather represents a pharmacological artefact. EvB should therefore not be used as an inhibitor of Œ¥-ENaC.  aPublisher supplied data 3aXenopus 3aalbumins 3aazo dyes 3aelectrophysiology 3aepithelium 3aoocytes 3asodium channels 3aspectral analysis 0aEpithelial sodium channel 0aENaC 0aAmiloride 0aEvans blue 0aDelta-ENaC1 aWolf, Annemarie1 aWichmann, Lukas1 aSch√∂nberger, Matthias1 aAlthaus, Mike0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2015 Oct. 23, v. 466 p.468-474dElsevier Inc.x0006-291X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2015.09.0523Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02991naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100003900144245018500183300001600368520149100384592002801875650001901903650002001922650001101942650001401953650001401967650000901981650001001990650002602000650001302026650002402039650001102063650001002074650002302084650001102107650001602118650001302134651001002147653001302157653002702170653000802197700003502205700002802240700002602268773011602294856007802410852000902488655001202497IND60679295320221120105533.0191221e20191201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067929532DNAL7 a10.2478/pjen-2019-00252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEl-Shazly, Ezz El-Din Abd El-Samea10aIncidence of cotton whitefly Bemisia tabaci (Gennadius, 1889) (Hemiptera: Aleyrodidae) infesting cucumber (Cucumis sativus L.) cultivars with reference to cultivar susceptibilities  ap. 379-393.  aField experiments were carried out in Egypt to investigate the infestation rates of cotton whitefly Bemisia tabaci on five cultivars of cucumbers Cucumis sativus during two consecutive late summer seasons from 11 August to 28 October 2015 and 2016. The susceptibilities of the cultivars to infestation by this pest were examined. The five cultivars ‚Äì Hayl, Nems, Beit Alpha Zena, Bahi and Wafier ‚Äì were cultivated on a private farm in Mansheyet Saqqara village, Giza. The results showed that whitefly infestation peaks were high in September and October, but low in November in both seasons. The population densities of Bemisia tabaci eggs, nymphs and adults on all the cultivars were slightly higher in 2015 than in 2016. Numbers of B. tabaci eggs, nymphs and adults rose with increasing the temperatures in both seasons, and mean numbers of nymphs and adults also increased with decreasing RH% on all the cultivars. The combination of temperature and humidity was an important regulatory factor affecting B. tabaci development. The results of this study showed that high infestation peaks of B. tabaci occurred in September and October of both seasons. The present results were used to classify the degrees of susceptibility of these cucumber cultivars to B. tabaci infestation as susceptible (S), low resistant (LR) and moderately resistant (MR). It is important that these degrees of susceptibility be referred to the degree of resistance of each cultivar to insect infestation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBemisia tabaci 3aCucumis sativus 3aadults 3acucumbers 3acultivars 3aeggs 3afarms 3afield experimentation 3ahumidity 3ainsect infestations 3anymphs 3apests 3apopulation density 3asummer 3atemperature 3avillages 3aEgypt 0aCucumber 0aPopulation fluctuation 0aRH%1 aAbdel-Ati, Khaled El-Sayed Ali1 aEl-Wahab, Horia Ali Abd1 aMansour, Magda Hashim0 tPolskie pismo entomologiczne.g2019 Dec. 01, v. 88, no. 4 p.379-393dSciendowJournal:jnl24265x2299-98847nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2478/pjen-2019-00253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02493naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001700142245012600159500001900285520146600304592002801770650001501798650002001813650002901833650001701862650001201879700001501891700001501906700001401921773015901935856007602094852000902170655001202179IND60738787720221122233620.0210524e20210505xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073878772DNAL7 a10.3390/ijgi100503022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWei, Zhiwei 12aA Progressive and Combined Building Simplification Approach with Local Structure Classification and Backtracking Strategy  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aSeveral algorithms have been developed to simplify buildings based on their local structure in past decades. However, different local structures are defined for certain purposes, and no algorithm can appropriately simplify all buildings. We propose a combined building simplification approach based on local structure classification and backtracking strategy. In this approach, local structures are classified and their based operations are defined by considering the buildings‚Äô orthogonal and non-orthogonal features. Each building is simplified to target scale with a selected local-structure-based operation progressively scale-by-scale. Rules are built to support the selection of local-structure-based operations with a binary decision tree, and a backtracking strategy is used when an invalid operation is applied. When the building is too small or the evaluation shows that it cannot be simplified based on local structures, template matching or enlargement algorithms are applied to simplify the building. A dataset (1:10k) collected from the Ordnance Survey was used for the experiment and simplified scale of 1:25k. Results satisfied legibility constraints and the change in area, orientation and position of simplified buildings are controlled within certain range by comparing with the results generated based on other four simplification algorithms. Possible use of our approach for continuous scale transformation of buildings is also discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3adata collection 3adecision support systems 3aspatial data 3asurveys1 aLiu, Yang 1 aCheng, Lu 1 aDing, Su 0 tISPRS international journal of geo-information.g2021 May 05, v. 10, no. 5dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21619x2220-99647nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijgi100503023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01622naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002900144245015800173300001600331520042800347592002800775650001200803650001700815650001000832650001200842650002000854650001400874650001600888650001900904653001700923653001400940653001400954653001800968653001300986653000800999653001401007773011601021856007801137852000901215655001201224IND60679295420221120100040.0191221e20191201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067929542DNAL7 a10.2478/pjen-2019-00262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWo≈∫nica, Andrzej J√≥zef10aGedanoleria eocenica ‚Äì a new genus and species from Eocene Baltic amber (Diptera: Heleomyzidae), with notes on heleomyzid-like flies from African copal  ap. 395-406.  aA new genus and species of a handsome heleomyzid fly, Gedanoleria eocenica gen. nov., sp. nov.

Moths of each species were preexposed for 1 h to varying dosages (100 ng-100 mg) of the major components of their respective pheromone blends in 1-liter Teflon containers with constant throughput of air. EAGs were performed on all insects 1 min after preexposure and at several subsequent intervals up to 120 min after exposure. Long-lasting peripheral adaptation was recorded by EAG after pheromone preexposure over a range of pheromone dosages in both C. pomonella (100 microgram-10 mg) and P. pyrusana (100 ng-100 mg). This reduction in EAG responsiveness lasted approximately equal to 60 and 10 min, respectively, for these two species. For G. molesta, a reduction in EAG responsiveness occurred only after 1 h of exposure to the highest dosage of pheromone tested (100 mg). Recovery from adaptation was also rapid in this species: EAGs were significantly reduced to all applied stimulus dosages only at 1-min postexposure. There was substantial variation in the prevalence and duration of decreased EAG responsiveness across the species investigated. However, where long-lasting adaptation was described, the phenomenon lasted less than or equal to 60 min. In addition, long-lasting adaptation was induced after prolonged exposures at estimated airborne concentrations of pheromone in the range of nanograms per milliliter, which are much higher than the pheromone concentrations in field plots treated with synthetic pheromone dispensers. Long-lasting peripheral adaptation after pheromone preexposure does not seem to be an important contributor to mating disruption. 3adose response 3aGrapholita molesta 3aelectroantennography 3asex pheromones 3amales 3apheromone blends 3aduration 3aelectrophysiology 3aPandemis pyrusana 3aCydia pomonella 0aphysiological response 0aPandemis 0apheromone preexposure1 aGut, L.J.1 aMiller, J.R.0 tAnnals of the Entomological Society of America.g2005 July, v. 98, no. 4 p.580-586dEntomological Society of Americax0013-87467nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.entsoc.org/pubs/periodicals/ann/3Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1603/0013-8746(2005)098%5B0580:OADOLP%5D2.0.CO;23Available from publisher's Web site  a20070815b20070902c00000000  aINDdNZMe2005/12/01  aOther US 7aarticle02372naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002000142245009000162500001900252520146600271592002801737650001301765650001501778650001701793651001901810700002101829773015901850856007602009852000902085655001202094IND60738787820221122233633.0210524e20210505xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073878782DNAL7 a10.3390/ijgi100503032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVrb√≠k, Daniel 10aCrowdsourcing of Popular Toponyms: How to Collect and Preserve Toponyms in Spoken Use  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe article presents a process of collecting unstandardized toponyms, in particular urbanonyms (place names denoting objects located in the cadastre of the city), within the territory of two municipalities in the Czech Republic. The collecting process was performed in two phases by crowdsourcing, using a web map application created especially for this purpose. In the first phase (October 2019‚ÄìSeptember 2020) it was collecting as many unstandardized toponyms as possible. In the second phase (October 2020‚ÄìJanuary 2021) we focused on the degree of the knowledge of these toponyms among the population living within the studied territory. The interest on the side of the general public was surprising in both phases. In the first phase, over five hundred respondents submitted more than two and a half thousand place names, most of them during the first two weeks. More than nine hundred respondents actively participated in the second phase, thanks to which we received an average of 200 responses for each place name. As regards the motivation of the public, it was most often altruism, patriotism, and curiosity that stimulated them; in the second phase, the element of gamification, embedded into the map application, also had a positive effect. The collected data can be used, for instance, in the activities of local authorities in the process of standardization of place names or as reference data for maps used within the integrated rescue system.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaltruism 3amotivation 3aspatial data 3aCzech Republic1 aL√°bus, V√°clav 0 tISPRS international journal of geo-information.g2021 May 05, v. 10, no. 5dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21619x2220-99647nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijgi100503033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02510naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002400150245010100174300001600275520156900291592002801860650001501888650001401903650001501917650001601932650001901948650002901967700001701996700002302013773010002036856005102136852000902187655001202196IND50088089520221120235707.0140412e20130901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008808952DNAL7 a10.1080/2150704X.2013.8042202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSugimoto, Mitsunobu10aOn the novel use of model-based decomposition in SAR polarimetry for target detection on the sea  ap. 843-852.  aIn this study, we show the novel applications of model-based scattering power decomposition analyses in synthetic aperture radar (SAR) polarimetry for man-made target detection on the sea surface. Model-based decomposition technique is primarily used for land-cover classification mainly because microwave scattering from land is composed of various scattering mechanisms. On the other hand, this technique has not been widely used for oceanic applications since the scattering from sea is mostly surface scattering, and obtaining a classification of different types of scattering is not as important as that on land. However, if an object is present on the sea surface, which gives rise to different scattering characteristics from the sea surface, the decomposition approach may be a useful technique for the detection and classification of the object. We suggest two approaches for target detection on the sea surface. One is to use the model-based decomposition as a polarimetric band-stop filter to block the dominant scattering from the background sea surface, and the other is to focus on the optimized double-bounce scattering component associated with the target using a rotation scheme of the polarimetric matrix. The advantage of these methods is the simplicity of the concept and the algorithm, in which no target-centric analysis is necessary. Experimental results show that model-based decomposition analyses can work as powerful target detectors, effectively separating scattering by targets from dominant background scattering from the sea surface.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3adetectors 3aland cover 3apolarimetry 3aremote sensing 3asynthetic aperture radar1 aOuchi, Kazuo1 aNakamura, Yasuhiro0 tRemote sensing letters.g2013 Sept. 1, v. 4, no. 9 p.843-852dTaylor & Francisx2150-70587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/2150704X.2013.804220  aDNAL 7aarticle02581naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100003200148245013200180300001600312520100700328592002801335650003001363650002201393650002101415650001001436650001801446650001401464650002701478650001301505650001401518650001001532650001901542653001501561653003001576653001001606653002701616653001901643653002001662700002401682700003501706700003901741700001801780700004201798700003501840773012101875856008201996852000902078655001202087IND60533252620221121012254.0161216e20151030xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053325262DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbrc.2015.09.0542doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFranco, Sulamita de Freitas10aGenomic analyses and expression evaluation of thaumatin-like gene family in the cacao fungal pathogen Moniliophthora perniciosa  ap. 629-636.  aThaumatin-like proteins (TLPs) are found in diverse eukaryotes. Plant TLPs, known as Pathogenicity Related Protein (PR-5), are considered fungal inhibitors. However, genes encoding TLPs are frequently found in fungal genomes. In this work, we have identified that Moniliophthora perniciosa, a basidiomycete pathogen that causes the Witches' Broom Disease (WBD) of cacao, presents thirteen putative TLPs from which four are expressed during WBD progression. One of them is similar to small TLPs, which are present in phytopathogenic basidiomycete, such as wheat stem rust fungus Puccinia graminis. Fungi genomes annotation and phylogenetic data revealed a larger number of TLPs in basidiomycetes when comparing with ascomycetes, suggesting that these proteins could be involved in specific traits of mushroom-forming species. Based on the present data, we discuss the contribution of TLPs in the combat against fungal competitors and hypothesize a role of these proteins in M.¬†perniciosa pathogenicity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMoniliophthora perniciosa 3aPuccinia graminis 3aeukaryotic cells 3agenes 3apathogenicity 3aphylogeny 3aplant pathogenic fungi 3aproteins 3astem rust 3awheat 3awitches' broom 0aThaumatins 0aMoniliophthora perniciosa 0aCacao 0aWitches' broom disease 0aGene expansion 0aGene expression1 aBaroni, Renata Moro1 aCarazzolle, Marcelo Falsarella1 aTeixeira, Paulo Jos√© Pereira Lima1 aReis, Osvaldo1 aPereira, Gon√ßalo Amarante Guimar√£es1 aMondego, Jorge Maur√≠cio Costa0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2015 Oct. 30, v. 466 p.629-636dElsevier Inc.x0006-291X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2015.09.0543Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02980naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024002700133040001800160100002200178245016900200300001600369506007600385520112700461592002801588506003701616650002001653650002101673650001201694650004301706650001301749650001901762650001601781650003201797650005201829650001101881650004101892650002901933650004201962650003002004650002802034650003002062700002402092700002702116700001802143700002202161700002202183700002102205700002402226700002602250773010102276856004002377852000902417655001202426IND4485274920221207131548.0120501e201205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448527492DNAL7 a224321072pmid7 aPMC33298512pmcid7 a10.2337/dc11-14342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRosenstock, Julio10aBaseline Factors Associated With Glycemic Control and Weight Loss When Exenatide Twice Daily Is Added to Optimized Insulin Glargine in Patients With Type 2 Diabetes  ap. 955-958.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aOBJECTIVE: To determine variables associated with glycemic and body weight responses when adding exenatide to basal insulin‚Äìtreated type 2 diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Exploratory subgroup analyses based on baseline A1C, disease duration, and BMI of a 30-week study comparing exenatide twice daily to placebo, added to optimized insulin glargine (intent-to-treat analysis: 137 exenatide; 122 placebo). RESULTS: Exenatide participants had greater A1C reductions compared with optimized insulin glargine alone, irrespective of baseline A1C (P < 0.001). Exenatide participants with longer diabetes duration and those with lower BMI had greater A1C reductions (P < 0.01). Exenatide participants lost more weight, regardless of baseline A1C or BMI (P < 0.05). Exenatide participants with longer diabetes duration lost the most weight (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Exenatide added to optimized basal insulin was associated with improved glycemic control and weight loss, irrespective of baseline A1C, diabetes duration, and BMI. Changes were evident in modestly obese patients and in those with longer diabetes duration.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abody mass index 3aglycemic control 3ainsulin 3anoninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 3apatients 3aweight control 3aweight loss 2aBlood Glucosexdrug effects 2aDiabetes Mellitus, Type 2xbloodxdrug therapy. 2aHumans 2aHypoglycemic Agentsxtherapeutic use 2aInsulinxtherapeutic use 2aInsulin, Long-Actingxtherapeutic use 2aPeptidesxtherapeutic use 2aVenomsxtherapeutic use 2aWeight Lossxdrug effects1 aShenouda, Sylvia K.1 aBergenstal, Richard M.1 aBuse, John B.1 aGlass, Leonard C.1 aHeilmann, Cory R.1 aKwan, Anita Y.M.1 aMacConell, Leigh A.1 aHoogwerf, Byron James0 tDiabetes care.g2012 May, v. 35, no. 5 p.955-958dAmerican Diabetes Associationx0149-59927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2337/dc11-1434  aDNAL 7aarticle02246naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002700143245014000170520109500310592002801405650002001433650001601453650001201469650001901481650001601500650001901516650001301535650001801548650001201566650001901578700002701597700002701624700002801651773011901679856007701798852000901875655001201884IND60742534520221117012710.0210624e20210608xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074253452DNAL7 a10.3390/foods100613212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aL√≥pez-G√°mez, Gloria 10aApplying Pulsed Electric Fields to Whole Carrots Enhances the Bioaccessibility of Carotenoid and Phenolic Compounds in Derived Products  aWe propose the application of pulsed electric fields (PEF) to carrots to obtain derived products with increased phenolic and carotenoid bioaccessibility. For this purpose, juices, purees, and oil-added purees were obtained from whole PEF-treated carrots (five pulses of 3.5 kV cm‚Åª¬π; 0.61 kJ kg‚Åª¬π). In order to obtain shelf-stable products, the effect of a thermal treatment (70 ¬∞C for 10 min) was also studied. Carrot juices exhibited the highest carotenoid (43.4 mg/100 g fresh weight) and phenolic (322 mg kg‚Åª¬π dry weight) contents. However, caffeic and coumaric acid derivatives were highly sensitive to PEF. The phenolic bioaccessibility reached 100% in purees obtained from the PEF-treated carrots, whereas the further thermally treated oil-added purees exhibited the greatest carotenoid bioaccessibility (7.8%). The increase in carotenoid bioaccessibility could be related to their better release and solubilization into micelles. The results suggest that food matrix aspects apart from particle size (e.g., pectin characteristics) are involved in phenolic bioaccessibility.  aPublisher supplied data 3abioavailability 3acarotenoids 3acarrots 3acoumaric acids 3afood matrix 3aheat treatment 3amicelles 3aparticle size 3apectins 3asolubilization1 aElez-Mart√≠nez, Pedro 1 aMart√≠n-Belloso, Olga,1 aSoliva-Fortuny, Robert 0 tFoods.g2021 June 08, v. 10, no. 6dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21651x2304-81587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/foods100613213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01251naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001400140245011300154300001600267520021500283592002800498650002300526650001100549650002100560650001600581650002200597700001500619700001400634700001600648700001700664700001800681773013100699856007400830852000900904655001200913IND60626925320221120163907.0190128e20190115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062692532DNAL7 a10.1039/c8cc09160a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZheng, Bo12aA degradable low molecular weight monomer system with lower critical solution temperature behaviour in water  ap. 782-785.  aA degradable thermo-responsive system was prepared and investigated.

In this work, we propose the use of¬†diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) metrics to¬†assess specific ultrastructural changes in the central nervous system during the early neurodegenerative stages of ALS. METHODS: Ultra‚Äêhigh field MRI and DTI data at 17.6T were obtained from fixed, excised mouse brains, and spinal cords from ALS (G93A‚ÄêSOD1) mice. RESULTS: Changes in fractional anisotropy (FA) and linear, planar, and spherical anisotropy ratios (CL, CP, and CS, respectively) of the diffusion eigenvalues were measured in white matter (WM) and gray matter (GM) areas associated with early axonal degenerative processes (in both the brain and the spinal cord). Specifically, in WM structures (corpus callosum, corticospinal tract, and spinal cord funiculi) as the disease progressed, FA, CL, and CP values decreased, whereas CS values increased. In GM structures (prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, and central spinal cord) FA and CP decreased, whereas the CL and CS values were unchanged or slightly smaller. Histological studies of a fluorescent mice model (YFP, G93A‚ÄêSOD1 mouse) corroborated the early alterations in neuronal morphology and axonal connectivity measured by DTI. CONCLUSIONS: Changes in diffusion tensor shape were observed in this animal model at the early, nonsymptomatic stages of ALS. Further studies of CL, CP, and CS as imaging biomarkers should be undertaken to refine this neuroimaging tool for future clinical use in the detection of the early stages of ALS.  aPublisher supplied data  a327cMagnetic Laboratory Visiting Scientist Program  a085740cChicago Biomedical Consortium  aDMR‚Äê1157490cNational Science Foundation 3aamyotrophic lateral sclerosis 3aanimal models 3aanisotropy 3abiomarkers 3afluorescence 3agenetically modified organisms 3ahippocampus 3ahistology 3amedicine 3amice 3aneurons 3aprefrontal cortex 3aspinal cord1 aWeissmann, Carina1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7196-53901 aAmin, Manish1 aFinkielsztein, Ariel1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9222-59221 aSumagin, Ronen1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5689-11001 aMareci, Thomas H.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4700-23641 aUchitel, Osvaldo D.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8909-67871 aMagin, Richard L.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5103-16110 tAnimal models and experimental medicine.g2020 June, v. 3, no. 2 p.117-129dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:28349x2576-20957nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ame2.121123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02458naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001700142245008300159500001900242520148200261592002801743650001301771650001701784650001301801700001901814700001701833700001501850700001501865700002001880773015901900856007602059852000902135655001202144IND60738788120221123013621.0210524e20210506xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073878812DNAL7 a10.3390/ijgi100503062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDong, Jiwei 10aStructure-Level 3D Building Model Encoding Method for Progressive Transmission  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aProgressive encoding and transmission, i.e., a crucial technical foundation of 3D Web Geographic Information Systems (WebGIS), addresses the contradiction between massive 3D building data and limited network transmission capacity. Most progressive encoding algorithms, taking vertices, edges or triangles as encoding units, may break the inherent geometric and topological characteristics of 3D building models. Thus, a novel 3D building model encoding method that can maintain the internal characteristics is proposed, which can be used for high-efficiency progressive transmission. With this method, each building is decomposed into three types of fundamental structures: main structure, independent structure and attached structure. A structural topology graph (STG) was constructed based on the connections among structures. Guided by STG, one or more structures were wrapped as the smallest incremental transmission unit, denoted as transmission node. When requested, the real-time position of viewpoint, orientation and visual importance of nodes are used to pick up expected nodes for responding. The results confirm that the proposed method can better maintain the geometric and topological characteristics while encoding 3D building models. While serving for transmission, the proposed method not only effectively reduces the transmission load, but also provides users with a better consistency experience on the building appearance at different simplification levels.  aPublisher supplied data 3ageometry 3aspatial data 3atopology1 aTan, Junzhong 1 aZhao, Qiang 1 aHe, Lixia 1 aLi, Sirui 1 aShe, Jiangfeng 0 tISPRS international journal of geo-information.g2021 May 06, v. 10, no. 5dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21619x2220-99647nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijgi100503063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03497naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024002800135040001800163100002500181245012400206300001800330506007600348520199700424592002802421506003702449650002502486650001102511650001402522653003702536653001602573653002202589653002802611653001002639653002502649653001802674653002602692700002502718700002202743700003602765700002502801773014202826856007402968852000903042655001203051IND60118931820221207070631.0141127e201409  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011893182DNAL7 a250131192pmid7 aPMC41447822pmcid7 a10.1093/jxb/eru2752doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSaladi√©, Montserrat14aThe 2-C-methylerythritol 4-phosphate pathway in melon is regulated by specialized isoforms for the first and last steps  ap. 5077-5092.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe 2-C-methyl-d-erythritol-4-phosphate (MEP) pathway provides the precursors for the biosynthesis of plastidial isoprenoids, which include the carotenoid pigments of many fruits. We have analysed the genes encoding the seven enzymes of the MEP pathway in melon (Cucumis melo L.) and determined that the first one, 1-deoxyxylulose 5-phosphate synthase (DXS), and the last one, 1-hydroxy-2-methyl-2-(E)-butenyl 4-diphosphate reductase (HDR), are represented in the genome as a small gene family and paralogous pair, respectively. In the case of DXS, three genes encode functional DXS activities which fall into previously established type I (CmDXS1) and II (CmDXS2a and CmDXS2b) categories, while a fourth DXS-like gene belonging to the type III group did not encode a protein with DXS activity. Their expression patterns and phylogenies suggest that CmDXS1 is functionally specialized for developmental and photosynthetic processes, while CmDXS2a and CmDXS2b are induced in flowers and ripening fruit of orange- (but not white-) fleshed varieties, coinciding with Œ≤-carotene accumulation. This is the first instance connecting type II DXS genes to specialized isoprenoid biosynthesis in the fruit of an agronomically important species. Two HDR paralogues were shown to encode functional enzymes, although only CmHDR1 was highly expressed in the tissues and developmental stages tested. Phylogenetic analysis showed that in cucurbits such as melon, these HDR paralogues probably arose through individual gene duplications in a common angiosperm ancestor, mimicking a prior division in gymnosperms, while other flowering plants, including apple, soy, canola, and poplar, acquired HDR duplicates recently as homoeologues through large-scale genome duplications.

We isolated Hitomebore EMS mutant, 520-6. Seedling growth of 520-6 is tolerant to low-nutrient supply, especially to low phosphorus (low P) supply and genetic mapping revealed the existence of nonsynonymous substitution within Os03g0793500 9th exon in 520-6. Os03g0793500 is reported as Heading date 16 (Hd16)/Early flowering1 (EL1), which is related with the rice flowering pathway. Hd16/EL1 encodes a casein kinase-I protein, and phosphorylates the floral repressor Ghd7 and the rice DELLA protein Slender rice 1 (SLR1). 520-6 carries the same nonfunctional Hd16 allele to that of Koshihikari, and the parental cultivar, Hitomebore, carries the functional Hd16 allele, as with Nipponbare. mRNA accumulation of GA-biosynthesis-related gene, OsGA2ox3 was enhanced in 520-6 compared with Hitomebore, indicating that Hd16 takes a part in feedback regulation of the GA biosynthetic gene. 520-6 and near-isogenic line (NIL) with nonfunctional Hd16 allele showed heavy straw weight and panicle weight in paddy fields with low nitrogen input and no fertilizer application in Kashimadai at Miyagi prefecture and Hikone at Shiga prefecture, respectively. In addition, plants with nonfunctional Hd16 allele showed late flowering phenotype in all tested fields. These results imply that disruption of Hd16 contributes to the improvement of rice growth by positively regulating GA signaling and late flowering, which resulted in increased rice yield under low-nutrient conditions.  aThis work was supported by the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science [Grant-in-Aid for JSPS Fellows / 15J09200]; Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, and Fisheries of Japan (Genomics‚Äêbased Technology for Agricultural Improvement, LCT0001).  aPublisher supplied data  aGrant-in-Aid for JSPS Fellows / 15J09200  a19H05637  aGenomics-based Technology for Agricultural Improve 3aOryza sativa 3aalleles 3abiosynthesis 3acasein 3achromosome mapping 3acultivars 3aexons 3afertilizer application 3afertilizers 3agrain yield 3aheading 3alate flowering 3amessenger RNA 3amutants 3anitrogen 3anon-specific serine/threonine protein kinase 3apaddies 3apanicles 3aphenotype 3aphosphorus 3aplant breeding 3arice 3aseedling growth 3astraw 0aRice yields 0aphosphorus 0aHd16 0aGA signaling 0agrain number1 aYoshida, Saki1 aTakagi, Hiroki1 aTerauchi, Ryohei1 aShimizu, Akifumi1 aFujiwara, T≈çru,0 tSoil science and plant nutrition.g2019 Nov. 02, v. 65, no. 6 p.589-597dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl19123x1747-07657nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00380768.2019.16470813Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02978naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002300150245009700173300001600270520139700286592002801683650001301711650001601724650002201740650001301762650001601775650002201791650001201813650001301825650001301838650001401851650002901865650001701894650002001911650002201931650001501953650001801968650001401986650000902000650001402009650002202023650003702045650001502082653001602097653001302113653003702126653003302163653004102196700002502237773010202262856005102364852000902415655001202424IND50087103920221119092611.0140412e20120101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008710392DNAL7 a10.1080/09593330.2011.5518422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSrivastava, Shaili10aBiosorption and biotransformation of chromium by Serratia sp. isolated from tannery effluent  ap. 113-122.  aA bacterium isolated from soil and sediment of a leather tanning mill's effluent was identified as Serratia sp. by the analysis of 16S rDNA. Scanning electron microscopy‚Äìenergy dispersive X-ray analysis (SEM-EDX) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were used to assess morphological changes and confirm chromium biosorption in Serratia sp. both in a shake-flask culture containing chromium and in a tannery wastewater. The SEMEDX and the elemental analysis of the chromate-containing samples confirmed the binding of chromium with the bacterial biomass. The TEM exhibited chromium accumulation throughout the bacterial cell, with some granular deposits in the cell periphery and in the cytoplasm. X-ray diffraction analysis (XRD) was used to quantify the chromium and to determine the chemical nature of the metal‚Äìmicrobe interaction. The XRD data showed the crystalline character of the precipitates, which consisted of mainly calcium chromium oxide, chromium fluoride phosphate and related organo-Cr(III) complex crystals. The XRD data also revealed a strong involvement of cellular carboxyl and phosphate groups in chromium binding by the bacterial biomass. The results of the study indicated that a combined mechanism of ion-exchange, complexation, croprecipitation and immobilization was involved in the biosorption of chromium by bacterial cells in contaminated environments.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSerratia 3aX-radiation 3aX-ray diffraction 3abacteria 3abiosorption 3abiotransformation 3acalcium 3achromium 3acrystals 3acytoplasm 3aenvironmental technology 3aion exchange 3aleather tanning 3amicrobial biomass 3aphosphates 3aribosomal DNA 3asediments 3asoil 3atanneries 3atannery effluents 3atransmission electron microscopy 3awastewater 0abiosorption 0achromium 0atransmission electron microscopy 0ascanning electron microscopy 0aenergy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy1 aThakur, Indu Shekhar0 tEnvironmental technology.g2012 Jan. 1, v. 33, no. 1 p.113-122dTaylor & Francisx1479-487X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09593330.2011.551842  aDNAL 7aarticle02819naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245013000167300002000297500001900317520116600336592002801502650002101530650001901551650001401570650002301584650002101607650001701628650001301645650003301658650002001691650002101711650001801732650002301750650001701773650002001790650002101810653001501831653002001846653001801866653001801884653002001902700001801922700001801940700001901958700001401977700005801991773014602049856008502195852000902280655001202289IND60719836620221118051811.0201207e20201120xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071983662DNAL7 a10.1021/acssuschemeng.0c072832doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYe, Shuxian10aMetal-Free Approach for a One-Pot Construction of Biodegradable Block Copolymers from Epoxides, Phthalic Anhydride, and CO‚ÇÇ  ap. 17860-17867.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aPoly(ester-b-carbonate)s are successfully synthesized for the first time through the metal-free copolymerization of cyclohexene oxide (CHO), propylene oxide (PO), phthalic anhydride (PA), and CO‚ÇÇ in a one-pot/one-step protocol. Catalyzed by triethyl borane (TEB) and bis(triphenylphosphine)iminium chloride (PPNCl) Lewis pair, the diblock and triblock copolymers with little tapering are synthesized from the initiation of PPNCl and phthalic acid, respectively. Copolymers with a high molecular weight of up to 50 kDa can be readily obtained under mild conditions. By changing the content of chain components in quadripolymers, glass transition temperature (Tg) values are adjusted between 86 and 115 ¬∞C. Moreover, the products appear extremely transparent with transparency of above 85% in the range of 600‚Äì1000 nm. This work first focuses on the synthesis of quadripolymers with high Tgs (>90 ¬∞C) and tensile strength (up to 54.8 MPa), which have similar thermal, mechanical properties, and transparency as those of commercial polystyrene and thus may be candidate green materials to replace the nondegradable polystyrene in extensive application areas.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiodegradability 3acarbon dioxide 3achlorides 3acomposite polymers 3acopolymerization 3acyclohexenes 3aepoxides 3aglass transition temperature 3agreen chemistry 3amolecular weight 3aphthalic acid 3aphthalic anhydride 3apolystyrenes 3apropylene oxide 3atensile strength 0ametal-free 0aCO2 utilization 0abiodegradable 0apolycarbonate 0ablock copolymer1 aWang, Wenjing1 aLiang, Jiaxin1 aWang, Shuanjin1 aXiao, Min1 aMeng, Yuezhong1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2997-98410 tACS sustainable chemistry & engineering.g2020 Nov. 20, v. 8, no. 48 p.17860-17867dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23317x2168-04857nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acssuschemeng.0c072833Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02837naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001700139245008800156300001800244520172800262592002801990650002202018650002602040650002702066650001102093650001502104650001402119650002202133650001702155650002702172650002702199650001302226700001702239700002002256773010302276856007502379852000902454655001202463IND60531020620161014000000.0160723e20121204xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053102062DNAL7 a10.1021/bi300759x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRey, Martial10aExploring the Conformational Dynamics of the Bovine ADP/ATP Carrier in Mitochondria  ap. 9727-9735.  aThe mitochondrial ADP/ATP carrier catalyzes the transport of ADP and ATP across the mitochondrial inner membrane by switching between two different conformations. They can be blocked by two inhibitors: carboxyatractyloside (CATR) and bongkrekic acid (BA). Our understanding of the ADP/ATP transport process is largely based on analysis of structural differences between the individual inhibited states. The X-ray crystallographic three-dimensional structure of bovine ADP/ATP carrier isoform 1 (bAnc1p) complexed with CATR was determined, but the structure of the BA‚Äìcarrier complex remains unknown. We recently investigated the conformational dynamics of bAnc1p in detergent solution using hydrogen/deuterium exchange and mass spectrometry (HDX-MS). This study shed light on some features of ADP/ATP translocation, but the mechanism itself and the organization of bAnc1p in the membrane required further investigation. This paper describes the first study of bAnc1p in the mitochondria on the whole-protein scale using HDX-MS. Membrane-embedded bAnc1p was deuterated and purified under HDX-MS-compatible conditions. Our results for the carrier in the mitochondrial inner membrane differed from those published for the carrier in a detergent solution. These differences were mainly in the upper half of the cavity that globally showed a limited H/D exchange whatever the complex analyzed and at the level of the matrix loops that were less accessible to the solvent in the BA‚Äìcarrier complex than in the CATR‚Äìcarrier complex. They are discussed with respect to published data for bAnc1p and have provided new insights into the conformation of the matrix loops of the bovine carrier in complex with BA in mitochondria.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3aadenosine diphosphate 3aadenosine triphosphate 3acattle 3adetergents 3adeuterium 3amass spectrometry 3amitochondria 3amitochondrial membrane 3amolecular conformation 3asolvents1 aForest, Eric1 aPelosi, Ludovic0 tBiochemistry.g2012 Dec. 04, v. 51, no. 48 p.9727-9735dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-49957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fbi300759x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03067naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001600152245013700168500001900305520162400324592002801948650003701976650001502013650002802028650002502056650000902081650001802090650001402108650001602122650002802138650003702166650001902203650001502222650002002237653002102257653000802278653000802286653000802294700001502302700001702317700001702334700001602351700001902367773010302386856008702489852000902576655001202585IND60713994720221121030357.0201216e202101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071399472DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfb.2020.1114072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTalha, Mohd10aCorrosion performance of various deformed surfaces of implant steel for coronary stent applications: Effect of protein concentration  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThis work was done to systematically elucidate the corrosion behavior of austenitic stainless steel subjected to various degree of cold deformation (10 %, 20 % & 30 %). The experiments were performed in phosphate buffer saline (PBS) solution having different concentrations of bovine serum albumin (0.2, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 4.0 g L‚Åª¬π). Potentiodynamic polarization tests and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analysis were performed to obtain the corrosion parameters. Scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive X-ray (SEM-EDX), atomic force microscopy (AFM) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) were used to determine the surface morphologies and chemical compositions of the surface films. Contact angle analysis was also used to detect the hydrophilic character of sample surfaces. The BSA had a considerable effect of inhibition on the corrosion of SSs in annealed as well as in deformed state due to its adsorption on surface of steel. For annealed samples, at 4.0 g L‚Åª¬πBSA concentration, the corrosion resistance was drastically decreased but interestingly not for sample with more than 10 % deformation and the concentration effect of BSA is also not very significant after 0.5 g L‚Åª¬π for deformed surfaces. The breakdown potential for 30 % deformed sample is quite higher in presence of BSA even at 4.0 g L‚Åª¬π while it is lowest for annealed samples in the same condition. The variation in contact angle with deformation is very less after adsorption of BSA. On the basis of the obtained results, mechanism aspect for corrosion of steel in presence of protein is also deliberated.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aadsorption 3aatomic force microscopy 3abovine serum albumin 3acold 3acontact angle 3acorrosion 3adeformation 3adielectric spectroscopy 3aenergy-dispersive X-ray analysis 3ahydrophilicity 3aphosphates 3astainless steel 0aCold deformation 0aBSA 0aAFM 0aXPS1 aMa, Yucong1 aLin, Yuanhua1 aMandal, A.K.1 aSinha, O.P.1 aKong, Xiangwei0 tColloids and surfaces.g2021 Jan., v. 197 p.111407-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11946x0927-77657nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfb.2020.1114073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02421naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005800148245013000206300001400336500002900350520136100379592002801740650002001768650001501788650001201803650001501815650001801830650003301848700002401881773011101905856008202016852000902098655001202107IND60738263320221123021223.0210522e202105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073826332DNAL7 a10.1007/s00442-020-04848-w2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aScott, Eric R.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7430-787910aUsing the right tool for the job: the difference between unsupervised and supervised analyses of multivariate ecological data  ap. 13-25.  aNALT-AP-4-rerunAP2-fuzzy  aEcologists often collect data with the aim of determining which of many variables are associated with a particular cause or consequence. Unsupervised analyses (e.g. principal components analysis, PCA) summarize variation in the data, without regard to the response. Supervised analyses (e.g., partial least squares, PLS) evaluate the variables to find the combination that best explain a causal relationship. These approaches are not interchangeable, especially when the variables most responsible for a causal relationship are not the greatest source of overall variation in the data‚Äîa situation that ecologists are likely to encounter. To illustrate the differences between unsupervised and supervised techniques, we analyze a published dataset using both PCA and PLS and compare the questions and answers associated with each method. We also use simulated datasets representing situations that further illustrate differences between unsupervised and supervised analyses. For simulated data with many correlated variables that were unrelated to the response, PLS was better than PCA at identifying which variables were associated with the response. There are many applications for both unsupervised and supervised approaches in ecology. However, PCA is currently overused, at least in part because supervised approaches, such as PLS, are less familiar.  aPublisher supplied data 3adata collection 3aecologists 3aecology 3aemployment 3aleast squares 3aprincipal component analysis1 aCrone, Elizabeth E.0 tOecologia.g2021 May, v. 196, no. 1 p.13-25dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl44754x0029-85497nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00442-020-04848-w3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03210naa a2200685 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024003300133040001800166100001700184245012600201300001800327506007600345520097000421592002801391506003701419650002201456650002801478650001701506650001401523650002201537650002101559650002001580650001601600650001301616650001101629650002201640650001201662650003001674650001701704650001101721650003101732650003101763650002301794650002401817650003301841650002501874650002401899650005701923650003901980650004402019650001802063650002202081700001602103700001802119700002102137700002402158700001902182700001602201700002202217700002102239700002302260773017402283856004602457852000902503655001202512IND4481191120221207104926.0120502e20120320xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448119112DNAL7 a223930082pmid7 aPMC33113792pmcid7 a10.1073/pnas.11147281092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGorai, Takeo10aF1Fo-ATPase, F-type proton-translocating ATPase, at the plasma membrane is critical for efficient influenza virus budding  ap. 4615-4620.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe identification of host factors involved in virus replication is important to understand virus life cycles better. Accordingly, we sought host factors that interact with the influenza viral nonstructural protein 2 by using coimmunoprecipitation followed by mass spectrometry. Among proteins associating with nonstructural protein 2, we focused on the Œ≤ subunit of the F1Fo-ATPase, which received a high probability score in our mass spectrometry analysis. The siRNA-mediated down-regulation of the Œ≤ subunit of the F1Fo-ATPase reduced influenza virion formation and virus growth in cell culture. We further found that efficient influenza virion formation requires the ATPase activity of F1Fo-ATPase and that plasma membrane-associated, but not mitochondrial, F1Fo-ATPase is important for influenza virion formation and budding. Hence, our data identify plasma membrane-associated F1Fo-ATPase as a critical host factor for efficient influenza virus replication.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aInfluenza A virus 3aadenosinetriphosphatase 3acell culture 3ainfluenza 3amass spectrometry 3amicrobial growth 3aplasma membrane 3aprobability 3aproteins 3avirion 3avirus replication 3aviruses 2aCell Membranexmetabolism 2aHEK293 Cells 2aHumans 2aInfluenza, Humanxvirology 2aMass Spectrometryxmethods 2aModels, Biological 2aModels, Statistical 2aOrthomyxoviridaexmetabolism 2aPlasmidsxmetabolism 2aProteomicsxmethods 2aProton-Translocating ATPasesxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aRNA, Small Interferingxmetabolism 2aViral Nonstructural Proteinsxchemistry 2aVirus Release 2aVirus Replication1 aGoto, Hideo1 aNoda, Takeshi1 aWatanabe, Tokiko1 aKozuka-Hata, Hiroko1 aOyama, Masaaki1 aTakano, Ryo1 aNeumann, Gabriele1 aWatanabe, Shinji1 aKawaoka, Yoshihiro0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2012 Mar. 20, v. 109, no. 12 p.4615-4620dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1114728109  aDNAL 7aarticle02353naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001600152245010600168500001900274520109700293592002801390650001301418650001401431650001201445650002201457650002301479650002601502650001501528653001501543653002401558653001901582653002401601653002601625700001401651700001801665700001901683700001501702700001201717773010601729856008701835852000901922655001201931IND60700797320221123043217.0200809e202010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070079732DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2020.1237682doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Hong10aResponse of process performance and microbial community to ammonia stress in series batch experiments  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aTo further clarify the key stage and microorganisms responsible for ammonia inhibition instability, three sequential batch experiments were conducted with various ammonia concentrations and different exposure modes. Acetate metabolism was most sensitive to ammonia, however, after continuous ammonia exposure, acetate metabolism was well restored by a shift in dominant microorganisms. In contrast, the metabolism of longer-chain volatile fatty acids (LCVFAs, C‚ÇÉ‚ÄìC‚ÇÖ) was only inhibited under a high ammonia concentration (‚â•6000¬†mg/L), however, once inhibited, continuous exposure neither restored the abundance of functional microbes nor induced new microorganisms to perform metabolic functions. Therefore, LCVFA metabolism was the key stage responsible for process instability under ammonia stress. Moreover, the deterioration of LCVFA metabolism was caused by the inhibition of syntrophic acetogenic bacteria (SAB) induced by total ammonia nitrogen, rather than the feedback inhibition from methanogenesis. That is, SAB were the key microorganisms involved in process instability.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetates 3aacetogens 3aammonia 3aammonium nitrogen 3amethane production 3amicrobial communities 3atechnology 0aFood waste 0aAnaerobic digestion 0aAmmonia stress 0aMicrobial community 0aInstability mechanism1 aPeng, Yun1 aYang, Pingjin1 aWang, Xiaoming1 aPeng, Xuya1 aLi, Lei0 tBioresource technology.g2020 Oct., v. 314 p.123768-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46263x0960-85247nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2020.1237683Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02920naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001600145245010700161300001600268500002000284520152400304592002801828596002701856650002001883650001801903650002001921650001901941650001501960650001301975650001101988650001301999650001402012650002002026650001602046650001402062650001002076651001802086700001902104700001502123700002002138700006202158773015402220856007902374852000902453655001202462IND60642327420221121064125.0190507e201905  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064232742DNAL7 a10.1111/1541-4337.124302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHe, Yuezhen10aImpacts of Starch and the Interactions Between Starch and Other Macromolecules on Wheat Falling Number  ap. 641-654.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aWheat with a low falling number (FN) has been particularly prevalent in recent years and has resulted in a loss of more than $140 million in a single year in the wheat industry in the Pacific Northwest of the United States. FN measurement is a standard method for the evaluation of grain Œ±‚Äêamylase activity, and a low FN indicates a reduction in hot wholemeal paste viscosity due to sprouting damage. Recent studies show that a low FN may result from a developmental change of starch and adverse effects of non‚ÄêŒ±‚Äêamylase macromolecules on wheat. In this review, we describe the principles of FN measurement and the relationship between FN and Œ±‚Äêamylase. We also discuss the isozymes, locations, and inhibitors of wheat Œ±‚Äêamylase. The effects of various aspects of starch, which is the substrate of Œ±‚Äêamylase, on wheat FN are also discussed, including starch structural characteristics (for example, starch granule architecture), starch susceptibility to Œ±‚Äêamylase, and the interaction between starch and nonstarch macromolecules (for example, lipids). Studies on the effects of planting environments (for example, temperature) and agronomic practices (for example, irrigation and fertilization) on both starch paste viscosity and FN are also reviewed. This paper highlights the importance of considering the impacts of starch and the interactions of starch and other macromolecules, including wheat Œ±‚Äêamylase, on wheat FN, which is important for developing strategies to solve the low FN problem.  aPublisher supplied data  cIdaho Wheat Commission 3aadverse effects 3aalpha-amylase 3aenzyme activity 3afalling number 3airrigation 3aisozymes 3alipids 3aplanting 3asprouting 3astarch granules 3atemperature 3aviscosity 3awheat 3aUnited States1 aLin, Yu‚ÄêLian1 aChen, Chen1 aTsai, Min‚ÄêHui1 aLin, Amy Hui‚ÄêMei1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2781-39950 tComprehensive reviews in food science and food safety.g2019 May, v. 18, no. 3 p.641-654dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:J000000062x1541-43377nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1541-4337.124303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02196naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245010300171300002000274520099800294592002801292650003701320650002801357650000901385650001901394650003101413650001101444650002201455650001301477650001301490700002401503700002201527700001901549700002301568700002301591773010101614856008601715852000901801655001201810IND60577531520180109000000.0170809e20161018xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057753152DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.langmuir.6b028082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGajos, Katarzyna10aElectron-Beam Lithographic Grafting of Functional Polymer Structures from Fluoropolymer Substrates  ap. 10641-10650.  aWell-defined submicrometer structures of poly(dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate) (PDMAEMA) were grafted from 100 Œºm thick films of poly(ethene-alt-tetrafluoroethene) after electron-beam lithographic exposure. To explore the possibilities and limits of the method under different exposure conditions, two different acceleration voltages (2.5 and 100 keV) were employed. First, the influence of electron energy and dose on the extent of grafting and on the structure‚Äôs morphology was determined via atomic force microscopy. The surface grafting with PDMAEMA was confirmed by advanced surface analytical techniques such as time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Additionally, the possibility of effective postpolymerization modification of grafted structures was demonstrated by quaternization of the grafted PDMAEMA to the polycationic QPDMAEMA form and by exploiting electrostatic interactions to bind charged organic dyes and functional proteins.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aatomic force microscopy 3adyes 3aelectric power 3aelectrostatic interactions 3aenergy 3amass spectrometry 3apolymers 3aproteins1 aGuzenko, Vitaliy A.1 aD√ºbner, Matthias1 aHaberko, Jakub1 aBudkowski, Andrzej1 aPadeste, Celestino0 tLangmuir.g2016 Oct. 18, v. 32, no. 41 p.10641-10650dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.langmuir.6b028083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03355naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001800145245010100163300001600264500002000280520187600300592002802176596002602204650001902230650001702249650002502266650002402291650002002315650002402335650001402359650002102373650002002394650001502414650001602429650002002445650002802465650002002493650001302513650001302526650001302539651000902552651001102561700005902572773015402631856007902785852000902864655001202873IND60642327520221121053121.0190507e201905  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064232752DNAL7 a10.1111/1541-4337.124412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTanna, Bhakti10aNutraceutical Potential of Seaweed Polysaccharides: Structure, Bioactivity, Safety, and Toxicity  ap. 817-831.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aIn recent years, marine organisms including seaweeds have been highlighted as potential sources of useful metabolites and bioactive compounds, with vast biological and physiological activities. Seaweeds have long been used as a food source, for medicinal purposes, and as dietary supplements in various Asian countries, and their potential benefits have recently attracted the attention of many Western and European countries. Their commercial value depends on their applications in the food, nutraceutical, and pharmaceutical industries. Seaweeds are considered a potential source of nutraceuticals or functional foods, and analysis of taste‚Äêoriented motives has revealed that seaweeds are preferentially selected over other types of marine foods by seafood consumers and people with high levels of health, education, and living status. It is a general perception that health conscious people prefer environmentally friendly food sources, and present an opportunity to focus on seaweed‚Äêbased foods, which have significant nutritional benefits to humans. Among the various bioactive constituents, seaweed polysaccharides have been proven to possess various beneficial properties including anticoagulant, anti‚Äêinflammatory, antioxidant, anticarcinogenic, and antiviral activities. The diversity and composition of seaweed polysaccharides play vital roles in these biological activities. Seaweeds are a rich source of sulfated polysaccharides, which are responsible for much of the bioactivity, as they can interact with various textures and cellular proteins. A number of toxicological assays and clinical trials suggest that the ingestion of seaweeds as functional foods should be considered worldwide to improve immune responses. In this review, different polysaccharides from seaweeds and their compositions and potential nutraceutical applications are discussed.  aPublisher supplied data  aPRIS‚Äê003/2017cCSIR 3aanticoagulants 3aantioxidants 3aantiviral properties 3abioactive compounds 3aclinical trials 3adietary supplements 3aeducation 3afunctional foods 3aimmune response 3amacroalgae 3ametabolites 3anutritive value 3apharmaceutical industry 3apolysaccharides 3aproteins 3aseafoods 3atoxicity 3aAsia 3aEurope1 aMishra, Avinash1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0342-010X0 tComprehensive reviews in food science and food safety.g2019 May, v. 18, no. 3 p.817-831dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:J000000062x1541-43377nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1541-4337.124413Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02709naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001700152245015900169500001900328520107700347592002801424650001501452650001801467650001901485650001701504650001601521650001201537650001301549650003001562650001801592650002001610650003201630650002001662650001801682650001301700650001701713650000901730653002101739653001001760653001801770653002601788700001801814700001701832700001801849700001801867700001701885700001801902700001601920700001701936773010601953856008702059852000902146655001202155IND60700797420221123042849.0200809e202010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070079742DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2020.1237692doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Zichao10aEvaluating responses of nitrification and denitrification to the co-selective pressure of divalent zinc and tetracycline based on resistance genes changes  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe responses of nitrification and denitrification to the divalent zinc (Zn(II)) and tetracycline (TC) co-selective pressure were evaluated in a sequencing batch reactor (SBR). The removal rates of organics and nitrogen, nitrifying and denitrifying enzymatic activity, and microbial diversity and richness at the Zn(II) and TC co-selective pressure were higher than those at the alone Zn(II) selective pressure, while were lower than those at the individual TC selective pressure. The Zn(II) and TC co-selective pressure induced the TC resistance genes abundance increase and the Zn(II) resistance genes levels decrease, and enhanced bacterial enzymatic modification resistance to TC and bacterial outer membrane resistance to Zn(II). The network analysis showed that the genera Nitrospira and Nitrosomonas of nitrifiers and the genera Ferruginibacter, Dechloromonas, Acidovorax, Rhodobacter, Thauera, Cloacibacterium, Zoogloea and Flavobacterium of denitrifiers were the potential hosts of antibiotics resistance genes (ARGs) and/or heavy metals resistance genes (HMRGs).  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcidovorax 3aDechloromonas 3aFlavobacterium 3aNitrosomonas 3aRhodobacter 3aThauera 3aZoogloea 3abacterial outer membranes 3abatch systems 3adenitrification 3adenitrifying microorganisms 3aenzyme activity 3anitrification 3anitrogen 3atetracycline 3azinc 0aResistance genes 0aHosts 0aDivalent zinc 0aCo-selective pressure1 aYuan, Shengyu1 aDeng, Zhiwei1 aWang, Yuejing1 aDeng, Shilong1 aSong, Youtao1 aSun, Congting1 aBu, Naishun1 aWang, Xinruo0 tBioresource technology.g2020 Oct., v. 314 p.123769-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46263x0960-85247nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2020.1237693Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03190naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100005600137245013500193300001800328500002000346520181800366592002802184650002802212650002402240650002302264650000902287650003102296650001602327650001902343650002002362650001702382650001802399650001402417650001302431650002202444650001702466650001602483700006102499773012702560856007202687852000902759655001202768IND60792049920221122223608.0220904e202210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079204992DNAL7 a10.1002/ps.70502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYuan, Lifeng1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4210-430210aMechanisms underlying the impact and interaction of temperature and UV‚ÄêB on the hatching of spider mite and phytoseiid mite eggs  ap. 4314-4323.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aBACKGROUND: A spider mite control method using night‚Äêtime ultraviolet (UV)‚ÄêB irradiation was recently developed for strawberry greenhouses (UV method). The control effect of this UV method is negatively affected by increasing temperature. Tetranychus urticae eggs are more resistant to a single dose of UV‚ÄêB irradiation than Neoseiulus californicus eggs. By contrast, N. californicus can better survive nightly UV‚ÄêB irradiation with the UV method compared with T. urticae. To elucidate the mechanism underlying these phenomena, we explored the hypotheses that higher temperature promotes photoenzymatic repair (PER) and that mortality is determined by UV‚ÄêB susceptibility in the embryonic stage exposed to UV‚ÄêB. RESULTS: PER efficacy was not promoted by increasing temperature. The lowest hatchability (around zero) of T. urticae eggs after a single dose of UV‚ÄêB irradiation (0.288 and 0.432‚ÄâkJ‚Äâm‚Åª¬≤) without photoreactivation was seen in the morphogenesis stages between ‚Äúcleavage ended‚Äù and ‚Äúeye points became colored‚Äù. Based on these results, we developed a linear function of daily UV‚ÄêB irradiance and deviation of cumulative irradiance during vulnerable embryonic developmental phases from 50% lethal dose (LD‚ÇÖ‚ÇÄ) after a single dose of UV‚ÄêB irradiation. The difference between T. urticae and N. californicus and changes in UV‚ÄêB vulnerability due to temperature could be explained by this simple relationship. CONCLUSION: Slower development in T. urticae than N. californicus in nature and developmental delay under low temperatures increase the ovicidal effects of the UV method. This shows the advantage of the simultaneous use of the UV method and biological control, contributing to the development of integrated pest management. ¬© 2022 Society of Chemical Industry.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNeoseiulus californicus 3aTetranychus urticae 3abiological control 3aeyes 3aintegrated pest management 3airradiation 3alethal dose 50 3alight intensity 3amite control 3amorphogenesis 3amortality 3aovicides 3aphotoreactivation 3astrawberries 3atemperature1 aOsakabe, Masahiro1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2246-34310 tPest management science.g2022 Oct., v. 78, no. 10 p.4314-4323dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.wJournal:jnl59519x1526-498X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ps.70503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02987naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001700146245014100163300002000304500001900324520138200343592002801725650004401753650001201797650002201809650001901831650001401850650001101864650001401875650001101889650001901900650001901919650002401938650001701962650001601979650002101995700001602016700001802032700005702050700005302107700005402160700001502214700001302229773017402242856008002416852000902496655001202505IND60711358320221122032655.0200923e20200904xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071135832DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.iecr.0c026782doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXing, Youxin10aStudy on the Mechanism and Kinetics of Waste Polypropylene Cracking Oxidation over the Mn‚ÇÇO‚ÇÉ/HY Catalyst by TG‚ÄìMS and In Situ FTIR  ap. 16569-16578.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe low temperature and high efficiency cracking oxidation of organic solid waste over the bifunctional catalyst with both acidity and oxidizing property is an environmentally attractive technology. In this study, the reaction mechanism and kinetics behavior of waste polypropylene (PP) during catalytic cracking oxidation processes were investigated utilizing thermo-gravimetry (TG), differential scanning calorimetry, TG‚Äìmass spectrometric, and in situ Fourier transform infrared (in situ FTIR) spectroscopy. PP was cracked into low-molecular weight organic substances (ester, ketone, etc.) over acid sites, which were further oxidized to CO‚ÇÇ and H‚ÇÇO over oxygen vacancy in the Mn‚ÇÇO‚ÇÉ/HY catalyst. The kinetics of catalytic cracking oxidation of pure PP and PP over different model catalysts was analyzed by Gauss-Peak function and the distributed activation energy model (DAEM). The catalytic oxygenation apparent activation energy (E) values of pure PP and PP over Mn‚ÇÇO‚ÇÉ, HY, and Mn‚ÇÇO‚ÇÉ/HY catalysts were 130‚Äì190 kJ/mol, 200‚Äì618, 108‚Äì228, and 41‚Äì99 kJ/mol, respectively. DAEM expressed appropriately the various changing trends of E in the reaction process. This theoretical basis of the catalytic cracking oxidation process of polymers would provide a reference for the design and optimization of the reactor and application upgrade of engineering.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aacidity 3aactivation energy 3acarbon dioxide 3acatalysts 3amodels 3aoxidation 3aoxygen 3apolypropylenes 3aprocess design 3areaction mechanisms 3asolid wastes 3atemperature 3athermogravimetry1 aWang, Yiren1 aHuang, Jincan1 aFei, Zhaoyang1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4048-42091 aLiu, Qing1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3844-60861 aChen, Xian1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3046-01231 aCui, Mifen1 aQiao, Xu0 tIndustrial & engineering chemistry process design and development.g2020 Sept. 04, v. 59, no. 38 p.16569-16578dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23342x1520-50457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.iecr.0c026783Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02607naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245013500172300002000307520157200327592002801899650003501927650001701962650003901979650001302018650001202031650001602043700001702059700002102076773010102097856008602198852000902284655001202293IND60577531720221118040430.0170809e20161018xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057753172DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.langmuir.6b028692doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPhukon, Aparajita10aEffect of Cosurfactants on the Interfacial Hydration of CTAB Quaternary Reverse Micelle Probed Using Excited State Proton Transfer  ap. 10659-10667.  aIt has been proven previously that the negatively charged photoacid 8-hydroxypyrene-1,3,6-trisulfonic acid trisodium salt (HPTS) resides at the interface of the cationic reverse micelle (RM) cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB)/octanol/water/cyclohexane and is a potential reporter of hydration through the excited state proton transfer (ESPT) process. However, the ESPT dynamics monitored by the pump‚Äìprobe study was limited to the ultrafast timescale and hence did not report any discernible ESPT signature. Herein, we reinvestigate the ESPT behavior using fluorescence spectroscopy in the nanosecond timescale and at different values of w‚ÇÄ (=[water]/[surfactant]). We clearly observed distinct w‚ÇÄ-dependent ESPT signatures analogous to conventional ternary cationic RMs implying considerable interfacial hydration. The results agree with a recent molecular simulation study, where significant penetration of water molecules into the interface was predicted for the CTAB quaternary RM. Moreover, we also found that the ESPT dynamics and the fluorescence anisotropy decay of HPTS depend differentially on the octanol/CTAB ratio (p‚ÇÄ). The ESPT process was found to be disfavored, whereas the anisotropy decay accelerates upon the increase in p‚ÇÄ values. Our analysis indicates that with the increase in the octanol concentration, dehydrated regions enrich gradually at the interface. However, the increase in octanol concentration may reduce the effective electrostatic potential experienced by the probe and thus may result in faster rotational relaxation.  aPublisher supplied data 3acetyltrimethylammonium bromide 3acyclohexanes 3afluorescence emission spectroscopy 3amicelles 3aoctanol 3asurfactants1 aRay, Sudipta1 aSahu, Kalyanasis0 tLangmuir.g2016 Oct. 18, v. 32, no. 41 p.10659-10667dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.langmuir.6b028693Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02605naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100002700112245015900139300001800298520135700316592002801673650002201701650003501723650001001758650001201768650005201780650001601832650001201848650002201860650001501882650002301897650001201920653002901932653002201961653002201983700002302005700002102028700002602049773012302075852000902198655001202207IND60128898420221119185643.0151124e201211  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012889842DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRichards, Stephanie L.10aEffects of Virus Dose and Extrinsic Incubation Temperature on Vector Competence of Culex nigripalpus (Diptera: Culicidae) for St. Louis Encephalitis Virus  ap. 1502-1506.  aCulex nigripalpus Theobald is a primary vector of St. Louis encephalitis virus in the southeastern United States. Cx. nigripalpus females were fed blood containing a low (4.0 ¬± 0.01 log‚ÇÅ‚ÇÄ plaque-forming unit equivalents (PFUeq) /ml) or high (4.7 ¬± 0.1 log10 PFUeq/ml) St. Louis encephalitis virus dose and maintained at extrinsic incubation temperatures (EIT) of 25 or 28¬∞C for 12 d. Vector competence was measured via quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction to estimate PFUeq using rates of infection, dissemination, and transmission. There were no differences in infection rates between the two EITs at either dose. The low dose had higher infection rates at both EITs. Dissemination rates were significantly higher at 28¬∞C compared with 25¬∞C at both doses. Virus transmission was observed (<7%) only at 28¬∞C for both doses. The virus titer in body tissues was greater at 28¬∞C compared with 25¬∞C at both doses. The difference between the EITs was greater at the low dose, resulting in a higher titer for the low dose than the high dose at 28¬∞C. Virus titers in leg tissues were greater in mosquitoes fed the high versus low dose, but were not influenced by EIT. Further investigations using a variety of environmental and biological factors would be useful in exploring the complexity of vector competence.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCulex nigripalpus 3aSaint Louis encephalitis virus 3ablood 3afemales 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3atemperature 3atissues 3avector competence 3aviral load 3avirus transmission 3aviruses 0aLouis encephalitis virus 0aCulex nigripalpus 0avector competence1 aAnderson, Sheri L.1 aLord, Cynthia C.1 aTabachnick, Walter J.0 tJournal of medical entomology.g2012 Nov., v. 49, no. 6 p.1502-1506dEntomological Society of Americax0022-25857nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle02932naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245011800170300001600288520132500304592002801629650001501657650002001672650002601692650001001718650001401728650001601742650001401758650001801772650001201790650001301802650001701815650001801832650001401850650002101864650002101885650001301906650001301919653001301932653001801945653001901963700002701982700005602009700002002065700005702085700006302142773011402205856008602319852000902405655001202414IND60705538220221120150101.0201023e20201010xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070553822DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jconrel.2020.07.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFattahi, Nadia10aEmerging insights on drug delivery by fatty acid mediated synthesis of lipophilic prodrugs as novel nanomedicines  ap. 556-598.  aMany drug molecules that are currently in the market suffer from short half-life, poor absorption, low specificity, rapid degradation, and resistance development. The design and development of lipophilic prodrugs can provide numerous benefits to overcome these challenges. Fatty acids (FAs), which are lipophilic biomolecules constituted of essential components of the living cells, carry out many necessary functions required for the development of efficient prodrugs. Chemical conjugation of FAs to drug molecules may change their pharmacodynamics/pharmacokinetics in vivo and even their toxicity profile. Well‚Äìdesigned FA-based prodrugs can also present other benefits, such as improved oral bioavailability, promoted tumor targeting efficiency, controlled drug release, and enhanced cellular penetration, leading to improved therapeutic efficacy. In this review, we discuss diverse drug molecules conjugated to various unsaturated FAs. Furthermore, various drug-FA conjugates loaded into various nanostructure delivery systems, including liposomes, solid lipid nanoparticles, emulsions, nano-assemblies, micelles, and polymeric nanoparticles, are reviewed.

Ae. epactius was collected from ff of the 12 study communities; the lone exception was the highest elevation community along the transect (>2,400 m). This mosquito species was thus encountered at elevations ranging from near sea level in Veracruz City on the Gulf of M√©xico to above 2,100 m in Puebla City in the central highlands. Collection sites included the city of Cordoba, located at ‚âà850 m, from which some of the first described specimens of Ae. epactius were collected in 1908. Estimates for percentage of premises in each community with Ae. epactius pupae present, and abundance of Ae. epactius pupae on the study premises, suggest that along the transect in central M√©xico, the mosquito is present but rare at sea level, most abundant at mid-range elevations from 1,250‚Äì1,750 m and then decreases in abundance above 1,800 m. Statistically significant parabolic relationships were found between percentage of premises with Ae. epactius pupae present and average minimum daily temperature, cumulative growing degree-days, and rainfall. We recorded Ae. epactius immatures from a wide range of container types including cement water tanks, barrels/ drums, tires, large earthen jars, small discarded containers, buckets, cement water troughs, flower pots, cement water cisterns, and larger discarded containers. There were 45 documented instances of co-occurrence of Ae. epactius and Aedes aegypti (L.) immatures in individual containers.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAedes aegypti 3aOchlerotatus 3abuckets 3acement 3aclimate 3aheat sums 3ahighlands 3aimmatures 3ajars 3aplant containers 3apupae 3arain 3asea level 3atanks 3atemperature 3atires 3awater troughs 3aMexico 0aAedes (Ochlerotatus) epactius 0aAedes aegypti 0aartificial container 0aclimate 0aelevation1 aWelsh‚ÄîRodriguez, Carlos1 aHayden, Mary H.1 aTapia‚ÄîSantos, Berenice1 aOchoa‚ÄîMartinez, Carolina1 aKobylinski, Kevin C.1 aUejio, Christopher K.1 aZielinski‚ÄîGutierrez, Emily1 aMonache, Luca Delle1 aMonaghan, Andrew J.1 aSteinhoff, Daniel F.1 aEisen, Lars0 tJournal of medical entomology.g2012 Nov., v. 49, no. 6 p.1244-1253dEntomological Society of Americax0022-25857nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle03728naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001400144245012200158300001800280520202900298592002802327650001302355650002302368650002002391650002202411650001102433650001502444650002002459650002302479650002202502650001802524650001002542650001702552650001202569650001602581650001602597650000902613650001502622650001602637650000702653650002702660650002302687650001802710650001102728650001802739653003602757653001302793653001702806653002402823653001702847700001502864700001802879773015302897856007903050852000903129655001203138IND60632791520221121161950.0190516e201905  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063279152DNAL7 a10.3168/jds.2018-160922doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBobbo, T.10aShort communication: Genetic aspects of milk differential somatic cell count in Holstein cows: A preliminary analysis  ap. 4275-4279.  aThe aim of the present study was to assess genetic variation and heritability of a novel indicator of udder health, milk differential somatic cell count (DSCC), which represents the percentage of neutrophils plus lymphocytes in the total somatic cell count (SCC). Furthermore, we estimated genetic and phenotypic correlations of DSCC with other milk traits routinely measured in Italian Holstein cows. Besides DSCC, test-day data included milk yield, composition traits (i.e., fat, protein, casein, and lactose percentages), pH, milk urea nitrogen, and SCC. After editing, the final data set included 10,709 test-day records of 5,142 cows in 299 herds. Mean of DSCC was 62.07%, which means that macrophages were approximately 38% of total SCC. Comparing our results with the literature offered compelling evidence of the importance of acquiring information about the proportion of the different cell types in milk to better define the udder health status. In addition, our analysis revealed, for the first time, that DSCC is a heritable trait, and heritability (0.08 ¬± 0.02) was higher than that of traditional somatic cell score (0.04 ¬± 0.02). Nevertheless, heritability of DSCC is still low compared with milk yield and quality traits. Single-trait analysis within parity showed that DSCC was less heritable in primiparous than in multiparous cows, whereas bivariate analysis confirmed that DSCC and somatic cell score were 2 different traits, as their genetic and phenotypic correlations differed from unity. From a genetic point of view, the DSCC was positively weakly associated with milk yield, lactose percentage, and milk urea nitrogen, and negatively associated with pH. Our findings contributed to the understanding of the genetic background of DSCC and are a precursor to the potential use of DSCC in breeding programs to enhance cow resistance to mastitis. However, further research is needed to determine the weight this novel trait should receive in a selection program aimed to reduce udder health problems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHolstein 3abivariate analysis 3abovine mastitis 3abreeding programs 3acasein 3adairy cows 3adata collection 3agenetic background 3agenetic variation 3ahealth status 3aherds 3aheritability 3alactose 3alymphocytes 3amacrophages 3amilk 3amilk yield 3aneutrophils 3apH 3aphenotypic correlation 3asomatic cell count 3asomatic cells 3audders 3aurea nitrogen 0adifferential somatic cell count 0amastitis 0aheritability 0agenetic correlation 0adairy cattle1 aPenasa, M.1 aCassandro, M.0 tJournal of dairy science.g2019 May, v. 102, no. 5 p.4275-4279dElsevier Inc.aAmerican Dairy Science AssociationwJournal:jnl45500x0022-03027nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3168/jds.2018-160923Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01896naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245011200163300001600275500001400291520071600305592002801021650002201049650001101071650001001082650001801092650001701110650001001127651002001137653001501157653001701172653002801189700002001217700001801237700001901255773014501274856008201419852000901501655001201510IND60675716820221121070156.0191223e201912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067571682DNAL7 a10.1016/j.wep.2019.10.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLock, Peter10aWineries and wine quality: The influence of location and archetype in the Hunter Valley region in Australia  ap. 180-190.  aNAL-light  aGeographical concentrations of wineries often occur within a region for obvious reasons of terroir. However, localised spatial concentrations of wineries may exist because of other factors. This paper explores whether co-location exists among wineries that have higher wine ratings in the Hunter Valley wine region in New South Wales, Australia. Key conclusions are that clustering of Hunter Valley wineries producing high-quality wines does not exist, the quality rating of a winery is influenced by its terroir, and wine quality among wineries in the region is higher for those producing the territorial brand wine of Semillon. Blending was found to have no impact on the quality of wine produced by a winery.  aPublisher supplied data 3aissues and policy 3amixing 3apaper 3awine industry 3awine quality 3awines 3aNew South Wales 0aArchetypes 0aWine cluster 0aHunter Valley Australia1 aMounter, Stuart1 aFleming, Euan1 aMoss, Jonathan0 tWine economics and policy.g2019 Dec., v. 8, no. 2 p.180-190dElsevier B.V.aUniCeSV, University of FlorencewJournal:21613x2212-97747nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wep.2019.10.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02924naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002400148245011800172520152600290592002801816650001501844650000901859650001301868650001501881650002401896650001101920650001401931650001101945650001001956650001601966650002401982650001002006650001302016650001702029653001002046653001802056653000902074653002002083653000902103653000802112700002402120700002802144700002602172700001802198773012202216856008302338852000902421655001202430IND60648483020221121030652.0200106e201907  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064848302DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bcab.2019.1012122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLone, Showkat Ahmad13aAn investigation on the sterilization of berry fruit using ozone: An option to preservation and long-term storage  aIn the present study, the effect of ozone treatment on the bacteria affecting fruits was investigated. The process of application of ozone for treatment was termed as OTRE technique. Ozone is a trioxygen inorganic molecule having a pungent smell and formed from the atmospheric oxygen (O‚ÇÇ) by the action of electrical discharge. Ozone was generated adopting Ozonizer through corona discharge technology. The bacteria isolated from Kiwi fruits by microbiological technique were exposed to ozone in two approaches, firstly, the ozone discharged at various time from 10 to 60‚ÄØmin into the reactor vessel containing bacteria (1.5‚ÄØ√ó‚ÄØ10‚Å∏‚ÄØCFU‚ÄØmL‚Åª¬π). Secondly, use of OTRE in cycle basis, where the sample was treated 30‚ÄØmin and 5‚ÄØmin break and again repeated for 10‚ÄØmin, which continued to the discharge of 60‚ÄØmin. The absorbance of all these varied intervals showed decrease in absorbance, which implies that the number of colonies were decreasing as the OTRE continued. In addition, the growth of these colonies on the nutrient agar was also confirming that the OTRE is quite effective to prevent bacteria from kiwi viz., the bacterial count was decreased from 1.5‚ÄØ√ó‚ÄØ10‚Å∏‚ÄØCFU‚ÄØmL‚Åª¬π to 2.0‚ÄØ√ó‚ÄØ10¬≤‚ÄØCFU‚ÄØmL‚Åª¬π in 30‚ÄØmin and 1.5‚ÄØ√ó‚ÄØ10‚Å∏‚ÄØCFU‚ÄØmL‚Åª¬π to 1.2‚ÄØ√ó‚ÄØ10¬≤‚ÄØCFU‚ÄØmL‚Åª¬π in 60‚ÄØmin. Thusly, OTRE technique is a rapid, better solution to preserve fruits from disease causing bacteria and enhance fruits durability against spoilage during postharvest storage.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorbance 3aagar 3abacteria 3adurability 3aelectric discharges 3afruits 3akiwifruit 3aoxygen 3aozone 3aplate count 3apostharvest storage 3asmell 3aspoilage 3astorage time 0aOzone 0aFree radicals 0aKiwi 0aPseudomonas sp. 0aOTRE 0aCFU1 aRaghunathan, Sathya1 aDavoodbasha, MubarakAli1 aSrinivasan, Hemalatha1 aLee, Sang-Yul0 tBiocatalysis and agricultural biotechnology.g2019 July, v. 20 p.101212-dElsevier LtdwJournal:6239x1878-81817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bcab.2019.1012123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02692naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001800152245012900170500001900299520124400318592002801562650002401590650002001614650001901634650001101653650001401664650001101678650002001689650001001709650001801719650001301737650001901750650002301769650001401792650001501806653002401821653002001845653002101865700001801886700002301904700006201927700003001989773010702019856008702126852000902213655001202222IND60694929420221121170835.0200621e202007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069492942DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biombioe.2020.1055462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShetty, Deepa10aBioaugmentation of anaerobic fungus Orpinomyces joyonii boosts sustainable biomethanation of rice straw without pretreatment  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aRice straw is an abundant, renewable and energy rich agricultural biomass. Energy recovery in the form of biomethane from rice straw can be a sustainable process. However, one of the drawbacks associated with this process is the recalcitrant nature of rice straw which necessitates energy intensive, expensive and polluting thermochemical pretreatment of the substrate. Fiber digesting anaerobic fungi have the ability to degrade the plant biomass. Hence, the present investigation was undertaken to enhance the biodegradation and subsequently the biomethanation of rice straw by supplementing the startup inoculum with anaerobic fiber digesting fungus, Orpinomyces joyonii. The average daily biogas and methane yield increased by 25.04% and 38.41% respectively over control reactor when the startup inoculum was supplemented with O. joyonii in the test reactor. The reduction in volatile solids, cellulose and hemicellulose components of rice straw during biomethanation process was observed to be 68%, 82%, and 97%, respectively. Orpinomyces joyonii supplementation of startup inoculum enhanced the biodegradation of lignocellulosic component and biomethane yield by anaerobic digestion of rice straw without thermochemical pretreatment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanaerobic digestion 3abioaugmentation 3abiodegradation 3abiogas 3acellulose 3aenergy 3aenergy recovery 3afungi 3ahemicellulose 3ainoculum 3alignocellulose 3amethane production 3aphytomass 3arice straw 0aOrpinomyces joyonii 0aAnaerobic fungi 0aRenewable energy1 aJoshi, Akshay1 aDagar, Sumit Singh1 aKshirsagar, Pranav1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1818-28101 aDhakephalkar, Prashant K.0 tBiomass and bioenergy.g2020 July, v. 138 p.105546-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl3929140x0961-95347nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biombioe.2020.1055463Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03698naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100005700139245009900196300001800295500002000313520214600333592002802479596004202507596003502549650003202584650001702616650001302633650001702646650001802663650001502681650001502696650000902711650003002720650002102750650001102771650001202782650001102794650002402805650000902829650001602838650001402854651001102868700005902879700005802938773012502996856007403121852000903195655001203204IND60793549520221116145119.0220918e202210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079354952DNAL7 a10.1111/jbi.144732doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTamario, Carl1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3176-130X10aEcological marginality and recruitment loss in the globally endangered freshwater pearl mussel  ap. 1793-1804.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aAIM: Ecological marginality is the existence of species/populations in the margins of their ecological niche, where conditions are harsher, and the risk of extinction is more pronounced. In threatened long‚Äêlived species, the disparity between distribution and population demography may provide understanding of how environmental heterogeneity shapes ecological marginality, potential extinction patterns and range shifts. We set out to evaluate this by combining a species distribution model (SDM) with population‚Äêspecific demography data. LOCATION: Sweden, 450,000‚Äâkm¬≤. MAJOR TAXA STUDIED: Freshwater pearl mussel (FPM, Margaritifera margaritifera) and two salmonid fish species. METHODS: A SDM for the mussel was constructed with MaxEnt using salmonid host fish (Salmo trutta plus S. salar) density, extreme low and high temperatures, precipitation, altitude, and clay content as explanatory variables. The output was used to test the ecological marginality hypothesis by evaluating whether lowly predicted populations had higher loss of recruitment. Logistic regression was used to explicitly test the factors involved in recruitment loss. RESULTS: Host fish density contributed the most (50.3%) to the mussel distribution, followed by lowest temperature the coldest month (34.3%) and altitude (10.3%), while the remaining explanatory variables contributed minimally (<3.3%). Populations with lower SDM scores lacked recruitment to a significantly higher degree. Populations inhabiting areas at low altitude, with lower densities of host fish, and warmer winter temperatures have lost recruitment to a higher degree. MAIN CONCLUSIONS: We found support for the ecological marginality hypothesis. The patterns indicate that FPM habitat niche may shift northwards over time. Salmonid host fish density seems to be a driving factor for both historical distribution and recent demographic performance. Finally, we emphasize the value of combining SDMs with independent data on population demography as it both lends rigidity to model validation and understanding of how ecological marginality affects species distribution and viability.  aPublisher supplied data  cStiftelsen Oscar och Lili Lamms Minne  cSvenska Forskningsradet Formas 3aMargaritifera margaritifera 3aSalmo trutta 3aaltitude 3abiogeography 3aclay fraction 3ademography 3aextinction 3afish 3ageographical distribution 3amodel validation 3amodels 3amussels 3aniches 3aregression analysis 3arisk 3atemperature 3aviability 3aSweden1 aTibblin, Petter1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6804-53421 aDegerman, Erik1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3620-05680 tJournal of biogeography.g2022 Oct., v. 49, no. 10 p.1793-1804dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl9765x0305-02707nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jbi.144733Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03387naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100003400147245014600181506011700327506007600444520137600520592002801896506003701924650002201961650001701983650001602000650001402016650001802030650001802048650001502066650001902081650001302100650001102113650001202124650000902136650001502145650001802160650001602178650001902194651001302213653002202226653001602248653002402264653002302288700002802311700002802339700002402367700007902391700006502470700007102535773012402606856008202730852000902812655001202821IND60771585220221215143901.0220426e20220501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077158522DNAL7 a10.1016/j.lwt.2022.1133722doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPereira de Oliveira, Jocilane10aTailoring the physicochemical properties of freeze-dried buriti oil microparticles by combining inulin and gum Arabic as encapsulation agents  aCreative Commons Attribution¬†4.0¬†Generic (CC BY-NC-ND¬†4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBuriti (Mauritia flexuosa) oil, native from the Amazon region, is a natural compound with several antioxidant properties and high carotene content. This oil can be used for cosmetic and dietary purposes. Considering the industrial importance of this oil, it is proposed a new high-tech product consisting in buriti oil microparticles. In this sense, the effect of biopolymers (inulin and gum arabic) on the physicochemical properties of freeze-dried buriti oil microparticles was evaluated in different combinations. The increase of inulin addition significantly increased (p ÀÇ 0.05) the Aw values and the moisture content of microparticles. Negative zeta potential near ‚àí30 mV was observed for all treatments indicating stability. The polydispersity index (PI) ranged from 0.14 to 0.37. The wettability found ranged from 59¬†s to 71¬†s, considered optimal for powdered foods for industry and consumer market requirements. Equal amount of wall material showed higher solubility value. The diffractograms showed that the incorporation of buriti oil in the microparticles does not significantly change the amorphous character already observed in the isolated materials. Hence, the combination in equivalent proportions of inulin and gum Arabic is a viable alternative for application of freeze-dried buriti oil microparticles in foods that present hydrophilic character.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aMauritia flexuosa 3aantioxidants 3abiopolymers 3acarotenes 3aencapsulation 3afreeze drying 3agum arabic 3ahydrophilicity 3aindustry 3ainulin 3amarkets 3aoils 3asolubility 3awater content 3awettability 3azeta potential 3aAmazonia 0aMauritia flexuosa 0aBiopolymers 0aBioactive compounds 0aMicroencapsulation1 aAlmeida, Osmar Patricio1 aCampelo, Pedro Henrique1 aCarneiro, Guilherme1 ade Oliveira Ferreira Rocha, Larissa1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6321-35461 aSantos, Jo√£o H.P.

The present study is an attempt to evaluate, in monetary terms, the willingness of people that a biomass based power plant be set up so that the practice of open field burning is halted. The willingness to pay (WTP) of people has been studied in Sangrur district, Punjab using Discrete Choice Experiments. Respondents representing the actual demographic of the district were randomly selected for the experiment. The study revealed that the highest WTP (‚Çπ 187) was observed for the economic benefits of the power plant, that is, increase in revenue of the farmers and, employment and training opportunities for the locals. This was followed by the WTP for benefits that biomass based power plant would offer by reducing the health risks (‚Çπ 165) associated with the burning of rice crop residues. The results of the study thus provide economic valuations of externalities associated with open field burning as well as underline the directions for bioenergy development in the state of Punjab, India.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair pollution 3aair quality 3abioenergy 3abiomass 3acase studies 3aemployment 3aincome 3apower plants 3arice 3asmog pollution 3awillingness to pay 3aIndia 0aBiomass energy 0aDiscrete choice experiment 0aOpen field burning 0aPunjab 0aWTP 0aCL 0aDCE 0aRPL 0aWTP0 tBiomass and bioenergy.g2020 July, v. 138 p.105577-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl3929140x0961-95347nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biombioe.2020.1055773Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03159naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131100001500149245018300164300001600347520183000363592002802193650001802221650001402239650001202253650002202265650002302287650004302310650002102353650000902374650002002383700001702403700001302420700001602433700001502449700001702464700001702481700001902498700001802517773010802535856008502643852000902728655001202737IND4478951420221122103224.0141111e201207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447895142DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jnutbio.2011.03.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYan, Jiong10aEnhanced autophagy plays a cardinal role in mitochondrial dysfunction in type 2 diabetic Goto√¢¬Ä¬ìKakizaki (GK) rats: ameliorating effects of (√¢¬à¬í)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate  ap. 716-724.  aOxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction are known to play important roles in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and insulin resistance. However, the pathology of T2DM remains complicated; in particular, the mechanisms of mitochondrial dysfunction in skeletal muscle and other insulin-sensitive tissues are as yet unclear. In the present study, we investigated the underlying mechanisms of oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction by focusing on mitochondrial dynamics, including mitochondrial biogenesis and autophagy, in skeletal muscle of a nonobese diabetic animal model √¢¬Ä¬î the Goto√¢¬Ä¬ìKakizaki (GK) rat. The results showed that GK rats exhibited impaired glucose metabolism, increased oxidative stress and decreased mitochondrial function. These dysfunctions were found to be associated with induction of LC3B, Beclin1 and DRP1 (key molecules mediating the autophagy pathway), while they appeared not to affect the mitochondrial biogenesis pathway. In addition, (√¢¬à¬í)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) was tested as a potential autophagy-targeting nutrient, and we found that EGCG treatment improved glucose tolerance and glucose homeostasis in GK rats, and reduced oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction in skeletal muscle. Amelioration of excessive muscle autophagy in GK rats through the down-regulation of the ROS-ERK/JNK-p53 pathway leads to improvement of glucose metabolism, reduction of oxidative stress and inhibition of mitochondrial loss and dysfunction. These results suggest (a) that hyperglycemia-associated oxidative stress may induce autophagy through up-regulation of the ROS-ERK/JNK-p53 pathway, which may contribute to mitochondrial loss in soleus muscle of diabetic GK rats, and (b) that EGCG may be a potential autophagy regulator useful in treatment of insulin resistance.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal models 3aautophagy 3aglucose 3aglucose tolerance 3ainsulin resistance 3anoninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 3aoxidative stress 3arats 3askeletal muscle1 aFeng, Zhihui1 aLiu, Jia1 aShen, Weili1 aWang, Ying1 aWertz, Karin1 aWeber, Peter1 aLong, Jiangang1 aLiu, Jiankang0 tJournal of nutritional biochemistry.g2012 July, v. 23, no. 7 p.716-724dElsevier Inc.x0955-28637nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jnutbio.2011.03.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02418naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006400148245007400212520102200286592002801308650002401336650001301360650001301373650001701386650001401403650002601417650000901443650001201452650001601464650001101480650001301491653001801504653003101522653002101553700006101574700003201635700006201667700002701729700002301756773011301779856008301892852000901975655001201984IND60744058720221123013011.0210911e202110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074405872DNAL7 a10.1016/j.clet.2021.1002012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFlores, Camila Gomes1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8768-207X10aSynthesis of potassium zeolite from rice husk ash as a silicon source  aRice is of great economic, social and cultural importance for many countries. However, rice industry generates rice husk ash (RHA), a low-density silicon-rich waste. The current work studied a way to minimize the impacts of this waste by synthesizing potassium zeolites from RHA. It was not found in the literature studies that have synthesized template-free potassic zeolites from this waste material. Commercial KOH and public supply water were used to approach industrial conditions. Time and temperature of the hydrothermal treatment were evaluated. The synthesized materials were mesoporous and it was identified the formation of potassium zeolites (Chabazite-K and Merlinoite). This zeolite was synthesized using low cost bio-precursors and this material can be potentially used as a potassium fertilizer. Based on this future application, the optimum condition for synthesis was using a 5¬†mol¬†L‚Åª¬π KOH solution, 2¬†mL¬†g‚Åª¬π solution:RHA ratio, 8¬†h of reaction time, and 125¬†¬∞C of temperature reaction.  aPublisher supplied data 3ahot water treatment 3ahusk ash 3aindustry 3aporous media 3apotassium 3apotassium fertilizers 3arice 3asilicon 3atemperature 3awastes 3azeolites 0aRice husk ash 0aAlternative silicon source 0aPotassic zeolite1 aSchneider, Helena1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7038-08791 aDornelles, Juliana Silveira1 aGomes, Lucas Bonan1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4332-92121 aMarcilio, Nilson Romeu1 aMelo, Pedro Juarez0 tCleaner engineering and technology.g2021 Oct., v. 4 p.100201-dElsevier LtdwJournal:27626x2666-79087nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.clet.2021.1002013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02213naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002700150245011300177300001600290520083900306592002801145650001201173650001101185650002201196650001401218650002201232650001201254650001401266650001301280650002901293650001901322651001601341653003601357653002001393653002801413700006401441700002201505700002101527700002001548700001701568773008901585856008401674852000901758655001201767IND60603650920221122031451.0180716e20151201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060365092DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2015.04.0692doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWalmsley, Michael R.W.10aCarbon Emissions Pinch Analysis for emissions reductions in the New Zealand transport sector through to 2050  ap. 569-576.  aThe CEPA (Carbon Emissions Pinch Analysis) method for energy planning has been modified for improved application to large transport systems. The modified method is applied to investigate the feasibility of NZ (New Zealand) reaching a 1990 emission levels for transport by 2050. The transportation sector has been traditionally a difficult area to transition to high levels of renewable energy because of the strong dependency on fossil fuels. For New Zealand, possible steps for low carbon emissions from transport are: (1) electrification of all rail, (2) wide-spread adoption of energy efficient vehicle technologies, (3) partial electrification of light passenger vehicles through plug-in hybrid and electric vehicle technologies, and (4), introduction of liquid fuels from biomass as an alternative to liquid fuels from petroleum.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiomass 3acarbon 3aelectric vehicles 3aemissions 3aenergy efficiency 3aliquids 3apetroleum 3aplanning 3arenewable energy sources 3atransportation 3aNew Zealand 0aCarbon Emissions Pinch Analysis 0aEnergy planning 0aTransport energy sector1 aWalmsley, Timothy G.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9192-07711 aAtkins, Martin J.1 aKamp, Peter J.J.1 aNeale, James R.1 aChand, Alvin0 tEnergy.g2015 Dec. 01, v. 92 p.569-576dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2015.04.0693Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01864naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001700139245007600156300001800232520084500250592002801095650002001123650002301143650002301166650001101189650002201200650002201222650003701244700001501281700002001296700002301316773010301339856007501442852000901517655001201526IND60577969720221120111824.0170811e20130514xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057796972DNAL7 a10.1021/ma400531v2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhou, Jinjun10aTuning Energy Levels of Low Bandgap Semi-Random Two Acceptor Copolymers  ap. 3391-3394.  aA series of low bandgap semi-random copolymers incorporating various ratios of two acceptor unitsÓó∏thienothiadiazole and benzothiadiazoleÓó∏were synthesized by Pd-catalyzed Stille coupling. The polymer films exhibited broad and intense absorption spectra, covering the spectral range from 350 nm up to 1240 nm. The optical bandgaps and HOMO levels of the polymers were calculated from ultraviolet‚Äìvisible spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry measurements, respectively. By changing the ratio of the two acceptor monomers, the HOMO levels of the polymers were tuned from ‚àí4.42 to ‚àí5.28 eV and the optical bandgaps were varied from 1.00 to 1.14 eV.

The surface hydrophobicity (38¬†Œºg) of the squid MP was significantly lower than that of the tilapia and hairtail (P¬†< 0.05), and its content (21¬†g/100¬†g) and emulsification characteristics were significantly higher than those of the tilapia and hairtail (P¬†< 0.05). Combined with the firmer structure of the squid surimi in the microstructure more intuitively indicated FO occupied the void spaces of the squid protein matrix, revealed the interaction between FO and MPs. Moreover, infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) and texture analysis demonstrated that tilapia MPs had the highest Œ≤-sheet (18%) and Œ≤-turn (39%) contents and the lowest Œ±-helix (23%) content compared with the hairtail and squid. Contributed to higher gel strength, reflecting the influence of secondary structure of MPs on the texture of surimi. These results further elaborated the effects of MPs‚Äô structure on surimi emulsified FO and the mechanism of FO on surimi gel, which is meaningful for functional surimi production.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acomparative study 3aemulsifying 3afish oils 3agel strength 3agels 3ahydrophobicity 3amicrostructure 3asquid 3asurimi 3atexture 0aFish oil 0aSurimi gels 0aProtein structure 0aMicrostructure observation 0aEmulsification1 aYi, Xiangzhou1 aXia, Guanghua1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7269-57511 aLiu, Zhongyuan1 aZhang, Xueying1 aLi, Chuan1 aShen, Xuanri0 tLebensmittel-Wissenschaft + Technologie.g2022 May 01, v. 161 p.113373-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl1644x0023-64387nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lwt.2022.1133733Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03057naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001400151245019200165520132400357592002801681650002001709650002501729650001301754650001801767650002601785650002001811650002701831650001001858650000901868650001101877650001801888650001801906650002201924650002301946650002001969650001601989650001902005653002202024653001802046653002202064653002702086653001902113653002302132700001502155700001702170700001902187700001702206700001402223700006002237773011102297856008602408852000902494655001202503IND60694929620221121195015.0200824e202010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069492962DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodres.2020.1093012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Yujie10aCurcumin-loaded liposomes prepared from bovine milk and krill phospholipids: Effects of chemical composition on storage stability, in-vitro digestibility and anti-hyperglycemic properties  aPresent study prepared curcumin liposomes with high encapsulation efficiency (>70%) using bovine milk and krill phospholipids; and investigated the effects of phospholipids composition on storage stability, in-vitro bioavailability, antioxidative and anti-hyperglycemic properties of the curcumin liposomes. Curcumin liposomes prepared from bovine milk phospholipids have smaller particle sizes (163.1¬†¬±¬†6.42¬†nm) and greater negative zeta potentials (‚àí26.7 mv) as compared to that prepared from krill phospholipids (particle size: 212.2¬†¬±¬†4.1¬†nm, zeta potential: ‚àí15.23 mv). In addition, curcumin liposomes from bovine milk phospholipids demonstrated better stability under harsh storage conditions (alkaline conditions, oxygen, high temperature and relative humidity). Nevertheless, curcumin-loaded liposomes prepared from bovine milk phospholipids have inferior bioavailability compared to that prepared from krill phospholipids. No significant differences can be observed in terms of anti-oxidative and anti-hyperglycemic properties of liposomes prepared from both bovine milk and krill phospholipids.

We evaluated the reliability of Imaging-PAM for quantifying benthic diatom biomass by comparing biomass determinations based on PAM fluorescence parameters to those based on cells counts and chlorophyll a measurements for cultures of the diatoms Cylindrotheca closterium and Seminavis robusta in different growth phases (exponential vs stationary) and cell size ranges. We found that PAM fluorescence imaging is particularly suited to monitor growth during the exponential phase. The dark adapted minimal fluorescence (F0) parameter proved to be the most reliable fluorescence-based biomass proxy, especially for establishing complete growth curves, as it was the most robust parameter to growth phase changes. A dark adaptation period prior to the PAM measurements improved the quantification of the stationary but not of the exponential cultures. Under the right conditions, dark adaptation can thus be omitted for exponentially growing cultures to enhance throughput. The use of multiwell plates for growth monitoring with the Imaging-PAM is feasible even though there can be a slight biomass underestimation near of the edges of the plate. Based on these findings, we formulate specific guidelines for using Imaging-PAM fluorometry in experiments with benthic diatom cultures. We especially recommend taking caution when working under conditions which potentially influence the condition of the photosynthetic apparatus of the algae.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCylindrotheca closterium 3aadhesion 3aalgae 3abiomass 3achlorophyll 3adark adaptation 3adevelopmental stages 3afluorescence 3afluorometry 3aguidelines 3aimage analysis 3amonitoring 3aphase transition 3aphotosynthesis 0aPulse amplitude modulated fluorometry 0aImaging-PAM fluorometry 0aGrowth monitoring 0aBiomass quantification 0aBenthic diatom1 aBlommaert, Lander1 aDaveloose, Ilse1 aVyverman, Wim1 aSabbe, Koen0 tJournal of experimental marine biology and ecology.g2019 Feb. 26, dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11705x0022-09817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jembe.2019.02.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02115naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002600140245013800166520085500304592002801159650001601187650001101203650002001214650001401234650001301248650001501261650002901276700001801305700002001323700002301343700002101366700002701387700002301414700002501437700002201462700002601484773012301510856007501633852000901708655001201717IND60757868420221119142255.0211125e20211022xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075786842DNAL7 a10.3390/nu131137142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEl Omari, Nasreddine 10aNatural Bioactive Compounds Targeting Epigenetic Pathways in Cancer: A Review on Alkaloids, Terpenoids, Quinones, and Isothiocyanates  aCancer is one of the most complex and systemic diseases affecting the health of mankind, causing major deaths with a significant increase. This pathology is caused by several risk factors, of which genetic disturbances constitute the major elements, which not only initiate tumor transformation but also epigenetic disturbances which are linked to it and which can induce transcriptional instability. Indeed, the involvement of epigenetic disturbances in cancer has been the subject of correlations today, in addition to the use of drugs that operate specifically on different epigenetic pathways. Natural molecules, especially those isolated from medicinal plants, have shown anticancer effects linked to mechanisms of action. The objective of this review is to explore the anticancer effects of alkaloids, terpenoids, quinones, and isothiocyanates.  aPublisher supplied data 3aepigenetics 3ahumans 3aisothiocyanates 3aneoplasms 3aquinones 3aterpenoids 3atranscription (genetics)1 aBakrim, Saad 1 aBakha, Mohamed 1 aLorenzo, Jos√© M.,1 aRebezov, Maksim 1 aShariati, Mohammad Ali1 aAboulaghras, Sara 1 aBalahbib, Abdelaali 1 aKhayrullin, Mars 1 aBouyahya, Abdelhakim 0 tNutrients.g2021 Oct. 22, v. 13, no. 11dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2271x2072-66437nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu131137143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02249naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001600148245010700164300001400271520087100285592002801156650000801184650002301192650001001215650001901225650000901244650000901253650001301262650000901275650003001284650002501314650001401339650002601353651001301379653000801392653000801400653000801408653002001416653002701436700003001463700002101493700002201514700001901536773012001555856008301675852000901758655001201767IND60648483520221121052206.0190830e201909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064848352DNAL7 a10.1053/j.tcam.2019.06.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMaia, Carla10aDetection of Rickettsia conorii israelensis DNA in the Blood of a Cat and a Dog From Southern Portugal  ap. 12-15.  aVector-borne rickettsioses represent emerging threats to public health worldwide. The aim of this work was the screening for the presence of Rickettsia spp. in the blood of dogs and cats from southern Portugal. A PCR product of the expected size was amplified from DNA extracts obtained from blood samples of 29 out of 225 (12.9%) cats and in 2 out of 375 (.5%) dogs using genus-specific primers targeting Rickettsia gltA. Rickettsia conorii israelensis was identified by phylogenetical analysis of partial ompB sequences, amplified from blood samples taken from both a cat and a dog. The obtained results reinforce the idea that domestic animals may act as sentinels for the presence of vector-borne Rickettsia spp. in a given geographical area.

The SWAT model was validated at five subbasins and used to simulate the water balance and hydrologic response to LC changes at multiple temporal and spatial scales. PLSR was used to evaluate the significance of the relative influence of LC classes on the hydrologic components.Based on the multitemporal LC change detections, Upper Awash basin is characterized by the decline of natural vegetation due to the swelling rise of cropland and urbanization. The monoplot of PLSR components exhibited that groundwater is highly correlated with the forest areas and lateral flow is strongly correlated with pasture, whereas, surface runoff is significantly attributed to the change in urban and cropland. The Variable Importance for the Projection (VIP) and PLSR weight (w) revealed that the decline of groundwater is mainly due to urban (VIP‚Äâ=‚Äâ1.34 and w=-0.55), whereas, the change in forest area enhanced groundwater (VIP‚Äâ=‚Äâ1.04 and w‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.47). The study provides valuable information on the contribution of particular LC to change in water balance which is vital for improved water resources management.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSoil and Water Assessment Tool model 3abasins 3acropland 3aforests 3agroundwater 3aland cover 3aleast squares 3amodel validation 3apastures 3arunoff 3aurbanization 3awater management 3awater resources 0aLand cover change 0aWater balance component 0aPartial least squares regression 0aSWAT model 0aUpper Awash basin1 aChakma, Sumedha1 aMelesse, Assefa M.0 tJournal of hydrology.g2019 Dec., v. 26 p.100640-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23229x2214-58187nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ejrh.2019.1006403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02980naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001200150245011200162300001400274520166900288592002801957650001301985650002301998650001502021650002402036650002302060650001402083650001502097650001902112650001902131650001502150651001002165653001202175653001402187653002302201653002802224700001702252700001702269700001502286700001502301700001602316773009602332856008502428852000902513655001202522IND60592003920221117001655.0180905e201609  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059200392DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aeolia.2016.05.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSun, Yu10aAirflow and sediment movement within an inland blowout in Hulun Buir sandy grassland, Inner Mongolia, China  ap. 13-22.  aWe measured wind flows and sediment transport rates through a blowout in Hulun Buir grassland, Inner Mongolia. Topography and the angle of incidence between the approaching wind and the blowout long-axis significantly affected the air flow. Flow separated and decelerated at the western wall and accelerated towards the east, until maximum wind speed occurred at the top of the depositional lobe, and then decelerated on the lee side. When airflow emerged on the eastern wall, resultant directions were always NW. When winds approached from directions within 17.5¬∞ of the blowout axis, both the northwestern and southwestern walls developed turbulent flow, and significant topographic steering occurred. The deceleration zone expanded eastwards from 10.3 to 12.8m from the western rim. When the wind direction was more oblique than 17.5¬∞, turbulent flow at the southwestern wall disappeared. ‚ÄòS-shaped‚Äô flow intensified, causing more pronounced steering at the bottom, but topographic steering elsewhere was reduced, and the boundary of the deceleration moved to 10m from the western rim. Minor sediment deposition occurred on the western wall, while other parts were eroded; maximum sediment transport occurred at the top of the depositional lobe. The approaching wind speed affected the sediment transport rate more than the direction; and spatial variability in sediment transport reflected differences in compaction, vegetation coverage, slope, aspect, and upwind sediment availability, resulting in asymmetrical development. Overall, flow-form interactions governed the flow structures and controlled the evolution of the blowout via sediment transport.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair flow 3aangle of incidence 3agrasslands 3asediment deposition 3asediment transport 3asediments 3atopography 3aturbulent flow 3awind direction 3awind speed 3aChina 0aBlowout 0aWind flow 0aSediment transport 0aTopographic development1 aHasi, Eerdun1 aLiu, Meiping1 aDu, Huishi1 aGuan, Chao1 aTao, Binbin0 tAeolian research.g2016 Sept., v. 22 p.13-22dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12141x1875-96377nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aeolia.2016.05.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02945naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245008600165300001600251520177500267592002802042650002202070650002602092650001402118650002002132650001302152650001102165650001702176650000902193700001902202700002102221700001902242700001902261700001702280700001902297700002202316700001802338700001802356773009202374856004802466852000902514655001202523IND50060800520221120074200.0130318e201212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006080052DNAL7 a10.1007/s11104-012-1510-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXue, Yan-Fang10aGrain and shoot zinc accumulation in winter wheat affected by nitrogen management  ap. 153-163.  aBACKGROUND AND AIMS: Nitrogen (N) nutrition is a critical factor in zinc (Zn) acquisition and its allocation into grain of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). Most of the information collected about this topic is, however, derived from the pot experiments. It is also not known whether optimal N management by decreasing N input could affect the Zn status in grain and plant in the field. The aim of this research is to investigate the impact of N management on grain and shoot Zn status of winter wheat. METHODS: Field experiments were conducted in two cropping seasons. RESULTS: Results showed applying N at optimal rate (198¬†kg‚ÄâN ha‚Åª¬π in 2007‚Äì2008 and 195¬†kg‚ÄâN ha‚Åª¬π in 2008‚Äì2009) maintained or resulted in significantly higher grain Zn concentration and especially grain content of Zn compared to no or lower N treatments. For example, grain Zn concentration increased from 21.5¬†mg‚Äâkg‚Åª¬π in the control to 30.9¬†mg‚Äâkg‚Åª¬π with optimized N supply in 2007‚Äì2008 and from 24.7¬†mg‚Äâkg‚Åª¬π in the control to 29.1¬†mg‚Äâkg‚Åª¬π with optimized N supply in 2008‚Äì2009. Further increasing N supply from optimal to excessive N supply resulted in non-significant increases in grain Zn concentration and content. Generally, similar trends were also found in shoot Zn. Moreover, 72¬†% to 100¬†% of the shoot Zn requirement had been accumulated at anthesis, and accordingly 67¬†% to 100¬†% of grain Zn content was provided by Zn remobilization from pre-anthesis Zn uptake with N supply. Grain Zn accumulation mainly originates from Zn remobilization and the optimal N management would ensure better shoot Zn nutrition to contribute to increasing Zn remobilization from vegetative tissues and to maintain relatively higher grain Zn for better human nutrition.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTriticum aestivum 3afield experimentation 3aflowering 3ahuman nutrition 3anitrogen 3ashoots 3awinter wheat 3azinc1 aYue, Shan-Chao1 aZhang, Yue-Qiang1 aCui, Zhen-Ling1 aChen, Xin-Ping1 aYang, Fujun,1 aCakmak, Ismail1 aMcGrath, Steve P.1 aZhang, Fu-Suo1 aZou, Chun-Qin0 tPlant and soil.g2012 Dec., v. 361, no. 1-2 p.153-163dSpringer-Verlagx0032-079X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11104-012-1510-2  aDNAL 7aarticle02860naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001400140245014200154300001800296520142700314592002801741650001601769650001401785650002301799650002501822650001701847650001401864650001901878650001301897650001201910650000701922650001101929650001601940650002101956650002201977700001501999700001202014700001702026700001802043700001702061700002002078700001602098700001502114700001202129773014202141856007402283852000902357655001202366IND60638550120221119035200.0190429e20190417xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063855012DNAL7 a10.1039/c9tb00249a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSun, Peng10aSuper tough bilayer actuators based on multi-responsive hydrogels crosslinked by functional triblock copolymer micelle macro-crosslinkers  ap. 2619-2625.  aIntelligent hydrogels responsive to external stimuli have been widely studied due to their great potentials for applications in artificial muscles, soft robotics, sensors and actuators. However, the weak mechanical properties, narrow response range, and slow response speed of many responsive hydrogels have hindered practical applications. In this paper, tough multi-responsive hydrogels were synthesized by using vinyl-functionalized triblock copolymer micelles as macro-crosslinkers and N-isopropyl acrylamide (NIPAM) and acrylamide (AAm) or 2-(dimethylamino)ethyl methacrylate (DMAEMA) and 2-acrylamido-2-methyl-1-propane-sulfonic acid (AMPS) as monomers. The P(NIPAM-co-AAm) hydrogels presented tensile strength of up to 1.6 MPa and compressive strength of up to 127 MPa and were tunable by changing their formulations. Moreover, the lower critical solution temperature (LCST) of the thermosensitive hydrogels was manipulated in a wide range by changing the molar ratio of NIPAM to AAm. Responsive hydrogel bilayers were fabricated through a two-step synthesis. A second layer of P(DMAEMA-co-AMPS) was synthesized on the first P(NIPAM-co-AAm) layer to obtain a bilayer hydrogel, which was responsive to temperature, pH and ionic strength changes to undergo fast and reversible shape transformation in a few minutes. This kind of strong and tough multi-responsive hydrogel device has broad prospects in soft actuators.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacrylamides 3aactuators 3acomposite polymers 3acompression strength 3acrosslinking 3ahydrogels 3aionic strength 3amicelles 3amuscles 3apH 3arobots 3atemperature 3atensile strength 3athermosensitivity1 aZhang, Hua1 aXu, Dan1 aWang, Zhenwu1 aWang, Liufang1 aGao, Guorong1 aHossain, Gaffar1 aWu, Jiangyu1 aWang, Rong1 aFu, Jun0 tJournal of materials chemistry B.g2019 Apr. 17, v. 7, no. 16 p.2619-2625dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26902x2050-75187nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c9tb00249a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02640naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002700151245009500178300001800273520137400291592002801665650001501693650001101708650000901719650002501728650001001753650001301763650001101776650003301787650001601820650001101836653001501847653001601862653002301878653003701901653002201938700002201960700002601982773011502008856008602123852000902209655001202218IND60565209120221120054615.0180831e20160120xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056520912DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2015.10.0842doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPhonphuak, Nonthaphong10aUtilization of waste glass to enhance physical‚Äìmechanical properties of fired clay brick  ap. 3057-3062.  aThe aim of this study was to investigate the enhancement of physical‚Äìmechanical properties of fired clay brick by incorporating waste glass in order to reduce the firing temperature. The ground waste glass was incorporated to the clay body at the dosages of 0, 5 and 10% by weight. Three temperatures viz., 900, 950 and 1000¬†¬∞C were used for firing. Compressive strength, water absorption, density, and porosity of the fired clay bricks were tested. The study showed that the incorporation of up to 10¬†wt.% of waste glass to clay bricks and fired at the temperatures of 900‚Äì1000¬†¬∞C enhanced the properties of fired clay bricks. The SEM micrographs showed the increased glass phase and reduced porosity with waste glass addition. The use of 10¬†wt.% waste glass and firing at 900¬†¬∞C yielded bricks with similar strength compared to that of normal clay brick fired at 1000¬†¬∞C. This allowed the use of low firing temperature of 900¬†¬∞C instead of the normally used 1000¬†¬∞C. The study also revealed that in addition to the glass phase fused-bond with the clay brick bodies, the fusion of crystalline quartz in clay also played an important role in enhancing the properties of clay bricks. As a conclusion, waste glass can be utilized in making brick to enhance the physical‚Äìmechanical properties of the fired clay brick or to lower the firing temperature.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3abricks 3aclay 3acompression strength 3aglass 3aporosity 3aquartz 3ascanning electron microscopy 3atemperature 3awastes 0aClay brick 0aWaste glass 0aFiring temperature 0aPhysical‚Äìmechanical properties 0aBrick manufacture1 aKanyakam, Siwadol1 aChindaprasirt, Prinya0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2016 Jan. 20, v. 112 p.3057-3062dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2015.10.0843Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02235naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002700150245015700177300001400334520086500348592002801213650002301241650002801264650002401292650002001316650001201336650001101348650004401359650001901403650001501422650001901437653002901456653002101485653003801506653001501544700002201559700002401581700002701605773008801632856008401720852000901804655001201813IND60582768720221122114310.0171008e20141205xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058276872DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carres.2014.08.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 avan Leeuwen, Sander S.10aDevelopment of a 1H NMR structural-reporter-group concept for the analysis of prebiotic galacto-oligosaccharides of the [Œ≤-d-Galp-(1‚Üíx)]n-d-Glcp type  ap. 54-58.  aSome Œ≤-galactosidases (EC 3.2.1.23) are capable of producing mixtures of linear and branched galacto-oligosaccharides (GOS) with various types of glycosidic linkages [degree of polymerization (DP) 2‚Äì8; mainly GalnGlc] when incubated under specific conditions with lactose.

The original matrix was made up of 10 trace elements (As, Cd, Cu, Co, Cr, Fe, Mn, Pb, Ni and Zn) estimated from 50 shallow alluvial dug wells in both the wet and the dry season for a duration of 3 hydrological years (2008‚Äì2011). Except As, Cu and Zn all the other toxic metals in the shallow aquifers were found exceeding the WHO maximum permissible limits for drinking water. PCA extracted five varimax factors as geogenic, agricultural and anthropogenic explaining about 71.2% of the total variance in the wet season and 69.3% total variance in the dry season. Hierarchical cluster analysis classified the dug wells into two groups in the wet season and three groups in the dry season with respect to the heavy elements. The results emphasized the need for routine monitoring and management in order to avoid contamination of groundwater sources in the NBP with respect to the dissolved trace elements.  aPublisher supplied data 3aWorld Health Organization 3aalluvial aquifer 3aarsenic 3acadmium 3achromium 3acluster analysis 3acobalt 3acopper 3adry season 3agroundwater contamination 3aheavy metals 3airon 3alead 3amanganese 3amonitoring 3anickel 3aprincipal component analysis 3atoxicity 3avariance 3awatersheds 3awells 3awet season 3azinc 3aIndia1 aBhattacharyya, Krishna G.0 tWater resources.g2018 Nov., v. 45, no. 6 p.966-974dPleiades PublishingwJournal:jnl7406x0097-80787nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1134/S009780781806012X3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02666naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001300140245009000153300001800243500001500261520137800276592002801654650001901682650002601701650001401727650002201741650000901763650001701772650001501789650001601804650001301820650001801833650002701851653001701878700001701895700001701912700001701929700001601946700001701962700001601979773014201995856007402137852000902211655001202220IND60638550420221119035138.0190429e20190424xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063855042DNAL7 a10.1039/c9tb00338j2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKou, Zhu10aAcid-responsive H‚ÇÇ-releasing Fe nanoparticles for safe and effective cancer therapy  ap. 2759-2765.  a2019-12-06  aHydrogen therapy is an emerging and promising strategy for treatment of inflammation-related diseases owing to the excellent bio-safety of hydrogen molecules (H‚ÇÇ), but is facing a challenge that the H‚ÇÇ concentration at the local disease site is hardly accumulated because of its high diffusibility and low solubility, limiting the efficacy of hydrogen therapy. Herein, we propose a nanomedicine strategy of imaging-guided tumour-targeted delivery and tumour microenvironment-triggered release of H‚ÇÇ to address this issue, and develop a kind of biocompatible carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC)-coated/stabilized Fe (Fe@CMC) nanoparticle with photoacoustic imaging (PAI), tumour targeting and acid responsive hydrogen release properties for cancer therapy. The Fe@CMC nanoparticles have demonstrated high intratumoural accumulation capability, high acid responsiveness, excellent PAI performance, selective cancer-killing effect and high bio-safety in vitro and in vivo. Effective inhibition of tumour growth is achieved by intravenous injection of the Fe@CMC nanoparticles, and the selective anti-cancer mechanism of Fe@CMC is discovered to be originated from the energy metabolism homeostasis regulatory function of the released H‚ÇÇ. The proposed nanomedicine-mediated hydrogen therapy strategy will open a new window for precise, high-efficacy and safe cancer treatment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aimage analysis 3aintravenous injection 3aneoplasms 3aenergy metabolism 3airon 3ananomedicine 3asolubility 3ahomeostasis 3ahydrogen 3ananoparticles 3acarboxymethylcellulose 0atherapeutics1 aZhao, Penghe1 aWang, Zhihao1 aJin, Zhaokui1 aChen, Lihua1 aSu, Bao-Lian1 aHe, Qianjun0 tJournal of materials chemistry B.g2019 Apr. 24, v. 7, no. 17 p.2759-2765dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26902x2050-75187nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c9tb00338j3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03139naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100003000147245007400177300001600251520174200267592002802009650001502037650001102052650001302063650001202076650002002088650002002108650001602128650001502144650001102159650000702170650003302177650001702210650001302227650001102240650002102251650001302272650001802285650002702303650001302330700002302343700002302366700003102389700002402420773011102444856008102555852000902636655001202645IND60621406620221120225242.0181117e201811  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062140662DNAL7 a10.1134/S00978078180601182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEltarabily, Mohamed Galal10aQuality Assessment of Southeast Nile Delta Groundwater for Irrigation  ap. 975-991.  aThe Nile Delta aquifer has deteriorated in the quality of the groundwater due to domestic, agricultural and industrial activities. In order to examine this, a dataset of thirty-one shallow groundwater samples and four surface water samples were collected in May 2014. The objective of our study is to investigate the hydrochemical characteristics of the groundwater at El-Khanka region in El-Qalubia governorate, southern Nile Delta to discuss the possibility of groundwater use for agricultural purpose. Groundwater types were defined, and the suitability for use in irrigation was evaluated. The factor analysis was conducted to investigate the relationship between the thirteen variables for exploring the loading of them in the model. Then, the principal component analysis was performed to identify the linear combination of variables that account for the greatest amount of common variance. Results showed that groundwater samples are mainly alkaline with an average pH value of 8.60. The total dissolved solids (TDS) range from 350 to 1456 mg/L. The highest concentrations of the anions and cations are sulfate ([Formula: see text]) and sodium (Na‚Å∫) respectively. The residual sodium carbonate (RSC) is less than 1.25 meq/L. Also, all groundwater samples are located in good and permissible salinity with TDS < 1500 mg/L. In addition, all samples are located in the low sodium hazard zone where sodium adsorption ratio (SAR) is less than 10. Therefore, it is concluded that, the groundwater is suitable for irrigation use in El-Qalubia Governorate. Four factors with Eigenvalues above 1.0 which correlated to each other contributed to the model with 81% of the total variance and governed the spatial variability of the aquifer.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3aanions 3aaquifers 3acations 3adata collection 3afactor analysis 3agroundwater 3airrigation 3amodels 3apH 3aprincipal component analysis 3ariver deltas 3asalinity 3asodium 3asodium carbonate 3asulfates 3asurface water 3atotal dissolved solids 3avariance1 aNegm, Abdelazim M.1 aYoshimura, Chihiro1 aAbdel-Abdel-Fattah, Sommer1 aSaavedra, Oliver C.0 tWater resources.g2018 Nov., v. 45, no. 6 p.975-991dPleiades PublishingwJournal:jnl7406x0097-80787nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1134/S00978078180601183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03127naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100001900166245012800185300001600313520162800329592002801957650001201985650001501997650001202012650001302024650001602037650001502053650001302068650000902081650001002090650001302100650001102113650001602124650001202140650001202152650001202164650001202176650001302188650001402201650001202215650002602227650001102253650002502264650000902289650001202298650002502310650001702335650001402352700001802366700002202384773008602406856004802492852000902540655001202549IND50089835720221118004459.0140523e201406  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008983572DNAL7 a244024172pmid7 a10.1007/s00412-013-0449-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChinone, Ayako10aTriploid planarian reproduces truly bisexually with euploid gametes produced through a different meiotic system between sex  ap. 265-272.  aAlthough polyploids are common among plants and some animals, polyploidization often causes reproductive failure. Triploids, in particular, are characterized by the problems of chromosomal pairing and segregation during meiosis, which may cause aneuploid gametes and results in sterility. Thus, they are generally considered to reproduce only asexually. In the case of the Platyhelminthes Dugesia ryukyuensis, populations with triploid karyotypes are normally found in nature as both fissiparous and oviparous triploids. Fissiparous triploids can also be experimentally sexualized if they are fed sexual planarians, developing both gonads and other reproductive organs. Fully sexualized worms begin reproducing by copulation rather than fission. In this study, we examined the genotypes of the offspring obtained by breeding sexualized triploids and found that the offspring inherited genes from both parents, i.e., they reproduced truly bisexually. Furthermore, meiotic chromosome behavior in triploid sexualized planarians differed significantly between male and female germ lines, in that female germ line cells remained triploid until prophase I, whereas male germ line cells appeared to become diploid before entry into meiosis. Oocytes at the late diplotene stage contained not only paired bivalents but also unpaired univalents that were suggested to produce diploid eggs if they remained in subsequent processes. Triploid planarians may therefore form euploid gametes by different meiotic systems in female and male germ lines and thus are be able to reproduce sexually in contrast to many other triploid organisms.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDugesia 3aaneuploidy 3aanimals 3abreeding 3achromosomes 3acopulation 3adiploidy 3aeggs 3agenes 3agenotype 3agonads 3akaryotyping 3ameiosis 3aoocytes 3aparents 3aprogeny 3aprophase 3atriploidy 2aAnimals 2aChromosomesxgenetics 2aFemale 2aGerm Cellsxcytology 2aMale 2aMeiosis 2aPlanariansxgenetics 2aReproduction 2aTriploidy1 aNodono, Hanae1 aMatsumoto, Midori0 tChromosoma.g2014 June, v. 123, no. 3 p.265-272dSpringer-Verlagx0009-59157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00412-013-0449-2  aDNAL 7aarticle02849naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245023400170300001200404520151900416592002801935650001901963650001801982650001702000650001802017650001402035650001802049650002402067650003302091650002002124650001302144650003702157650001602194700002402210700002502234773011402259856008102373852000902454655001202463IND60575163220221118162918.0170728e201705  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057516322DNAL7 a10.1007/s12665-017-6687-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPaul, Kyra Chester10aNew insights into rare earth element (REE) particulate generated by cigarette lighters: an electron microscopy and materials science investigation of a poorly understood indoor air pollutant and constraints for urban geochemistry  ap. 369.  aCigarette smoking is a well-recognized cause of lung cancer and other diseases and is a major contributor to indoor air pollution in numerous settings worldwide. Most cigarette lighters use rare earth element (REE) mischmetal in their flints in order to aid ignition, and these lighters thus have pyrophoric properties. REE particulate emitted from these lighters presents a complexity in the role of health of smokers that has yet to be explored fully. Furthermore, these particles are likely present in numerous urban settings and contribute to the complexities of urban geochemistry. Details of the material properties of rare earth element (REE) particulate derived from smoking lighters are determined first the first time. Particulate was investigated using back-scatter detection scanning electron microscopy techniques and transmission electron microscopy techniques. Several particle types were observed and demonstrate a diverse range of size and textures, many of which are previously not documented and are much smaller than previous basic scanning electron microscopy investigations. These include irregularly shaped fragments of mischmetal, micrometer-scale spherules, aggregates of nanospherules, and platy sponge-like nanoparticles. All of these particles have significant REE content, and most are of a particle size that can be deposited deep in the lung. The available literature regarding toxicity of REEs and the material science data presented here argues very strongly for cause for concern.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair pollutants 3aair pollution 3ageochemistry 3ananoparticles 3aneoplasms 3aparticle size 3arare earth elements 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asmoking (habit) 3atoxicity 3atransmission electron microscopy 3aurban areas1 aSilverstein, Joshua1 aKrekeler, Mark P.

Understanding mechanisms of change requires long‚Äêterm monitoring of multiple ecological parameters. Here, we present the findings of a collaboration between government scientists, local people, park rangers, and academic researchers that provide insights into changes in plant composition, phenology, and growth over 18¬†yr on Qikiqtaruk‚ÄêHerschel Island, Canada. Qikiqtaruk is an important focal research site located at the latitudinal tall shrub line in the western Arctic. This unique ecological monitoring program indicates the following findings: (1) nine days per decade advance of spring phenology, (2) a doubling of average plant canopy height per decade, but no directional change in shrub radial growth, and (3) a doubling of shrub and graminoid abundance and a decrease by one‚Äêhalf in bare ground cover per decade. Ecological changes are concurrent with satellite‚Äêobserved greening and, when integrated, suggest that indirect warming from increased growing season length and active layer depths, rather than warming summer air temperatures alone, could be important drivers of the observed tundra vegetation change. Our results highlight the vital role that long‚Äêterm and multi‚Äêparameter ecological monitoring plays in both the detection and attribution of global change.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair temperature 3acanopy 3acanopy height 3aglobal change 3agraminoids 3agrowing season 3amonitoring 3apark rangers 3aphenology 3aresearchers 3ascientists 3ashrubs 3aspring 3asummer 3atundra 3aArctic region 3aCanada1 aGrabowski, Meagan M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6653-66661 aThomas, Haydn J.

A total of 1185 topsoil samples (0‚Äì20‚Äâcm) were collected from southern Jiangsu Province of China in 1980, 2000, and 2015, and the geostatistical sequential Gaussian simulation (SGS) was used to quantify the spatio-temporal patterns of changes in soil pH and identify the areas with significantly-declined pH. A significant topsoil acidification occurred in major croplands of the study area, with mean decrements of 0.56 and 0.52 units over the periods of 1980‚Äì2000 and 2000‚Äì2015, respectively. A significant decrease in pH occurred in the areas surrounding Taihu Lake during 1980‚Äì2000, and a further decrease was evident predominantly in the northeast during 2000‚Äì2015. Over the entire 35-year period, the soil pH for approximately 79% of the study area declined significantly. The decline over the first two decades (1980‚Äì2000) was largely attributed to increased chemical fertilizer inputs and the development of industries, while the further enhanced industrial emissions resulting from the significant expansion of factories were the primary reason for the accelerated soil acidification in the subsequent 15 years (2000‚Äì2015). Results from this study may serve as a basis for developing management strategies to achieve better soil quality in similar areas moving toward industrialization.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacidification 3acropland 3adecision making 3aemissions 3afactories 3afertilizer application 3ageostatistics 3aindustrialization 3alakes 3amineral fertilizers 3ariver deltas 3asoil acidification 3asoil pH 3asoil quality 3atopsoil 3aChina 3aYangtze River 0aCropland soil 0aSoil acidification 0aSpatio-temporal changes 0aAgricultural management practices 0aIndustrialization1 aZhao, Yongcun1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6747-16651 aLi, Haidong1 aShi, Xuezheng1 aLu, Fangyi1 aZhang, Xiu1 aPeng, Yuxuan0 tAgriculture, ecosystems & environment.g2019 Feb. 15, v. 272 p.95-104dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl34709x0167-88097nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agee.2018.11.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02979naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245009100171300001600262520176900278592002802047650001902075650001702094650001702111650002002128650001702148650000902165650001102174650002002185650001202205653002102217653001102238653001702249653002402266700006102290700001902351700002102370773008502391856008402476852000902560655001202569IND60551998120221120091230.0170606e201412  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055199812DNAL7 a10.1016/j.molimm.2014.05.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKarnell, Jodi L.10aDiscerning the kinetics of autoimmune manifestations in a model of Sj√∂gren's syndrome  ap. 277-282.  aEctopic follicles are non-encapsulated organized lymphoid structures that form at sites of inflammation and presumably contribute to the activation and differentiation of cells with autoreactive potential within target tissues. As such, directed targeting of ectopic follicles in settings of autoimmunity may provide a means to specifically inhibit the activation of autoreactive cells without impairing protective immune responses ongoing in peripheral lymphoid tissues. NOD¬∑H2h4 mice are a non-diabetic strain of NOD mice which develop a Sj√∂gren's syndrome-like disease which includes the formation of ectopic follicles in the salivary gland and characteristic Sj√∂gren's autoantibodies. The goal of these studies was to better characterize the formation of ectopic follicles in this model and to explore their contribution to autoimmunity. Our studies show that by 8 weeks of age, young NOD¬∑H2h4 mice spontaneously develop an abundance of splenic germinal centers, prior to the emergence of lymphocyte infiltration in the salivary gland tissue. Ectopic follicle formation in the salivary gland begins to appear in these mice between 12 and 16 weeks of age. Interestingly, anti-Ro and anti-La autoantibodies precede the development of ectopic follicles in young NOD¬∑H2h4 mice. In contrast, production of anti-dsDNA antibodies is delayed and largely coincides with the formation of ectopic follicles in these mice. These data suggest that tertiary lymphoid structures may arise from the trafficking of activated T and B cells to sites of inflammation in non-lymphoid tissues. Furthermore, local presentation of autoantigens may then promote the expansion of autoreactive cells with specificities distinct from those generated in the splenic micro-environment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aautoantibodies 3aautoantigens 3aautoimmunity 3aimmune response 3ainflammation 3amice 3amodels 3asalivary glands 3atissues 0aEctopic follicle 0aB cell 0aAutoantibody 0aSj√∂gren's syndrome1 aMahmoud, Tamer I.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0667-38821 aHerbst, Ronald1 aEttinger, Rachel0 tMolecular Immunology.g2014 Dec., v. 62 p.277-282dElsevier Ltdx0161-58907nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.molimm.2014.05.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03015naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100006200151245007000213300001800283520166600301592002801967650002301995650001902018650001202037650001302049650001102062650001602073650001702089650000902106650001402115650001102129650001402140650001502154650000902169653001902178653001502197653001502212653002402227700001702251700003002268700002002298700001702318773011502335856008602450852000902536655001202545IND60565209920221120042218.0180831e20160120xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056520992DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2015.10.1032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSyukor, A.R.

This work was focused on investigating the improvement in the conventional oxidation pond process produced by the integrated phytogreen system for the treatment of wastewater. Among the conventional treatment systems, the phytogreen integrated oxidation pond process appears to be an efficient system, affecting the bio-removal of heavy metals. The influence of the integrated phytogreen system, including two different aquatic plants (Typha angustifolia sp. and Limnocharis flava sp.) in the conventional oxidation pond process, was investigated for a retention time of 13 days. The results revealed that the integrated phytogreen system realized the maximum removal of copper to 79.07%, magnesium to 68%, cadmium to 61.07%, chromium to 69.17%, nickel to74.87%, iron to 81.17%, lead to 62.07% and zinc to 63% at a retention time of 13 days when the two plant species were combined together. A positive relation between retention time and heavy metal removal was studied, and it was confirmed by the negative and significant correlation coefficients of the corresponding heavy metals with retention period. The results revealed that the integrated phytogreen system consisting of two different aquatic plants (T. angustifolia sp. and Limnocharis flava sp.) in the conventional oxidation pond process is a reliable and ecologically attractive option. Finally, integration of phytogreen is proposed to minimize heavy metal contamination in wastewater.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTypha angustifolia 3aaquatic plants 3acadmium 3achromium 3acopper 3acorrelation 3aheavy metals 3airon 3amagnesium 3anickel 3aoxidation 3awastewater 3azinc 0aRetention time 0aWastewater 0aPhytogreen 0aHeavy metal removal1 aSulaiman, S.1 aSiddique, Md.

Our results are the first published evidence of bioluminescence among zooplankton during the Arctic polar night. The observations were collected by a bathyphotometer detecting bioluminescence, integrated into an autonomous underwater vehicle, to determine the concentration and intensity of bioluminescent flashes as a function of time of day and depth. To further understand community dynamics and composition, plankton nets were used to collect organisms passing through the bathyphotometer along with traditional vertical net tows. Additionally, using a moored bathyphotometer closed to the sampling site, the bioluminescence potential itself was shown not to have a diurnal or circadian rhythm. Rather, our results provide evidence for a diel vertical migration of bioluminescent zooplankton that does not correspond to any externally detectable changes in illumination.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acommunity structure 3alighting 3abioluminescence 3acircadian rhythm 3azooplankton 3aArctic region 0avehicles1 aB√•tnes, A.

However, social power and the heterogeneity of human societies, which are crucial to unravel the feedback mechanisms underlying human-water systems, have not been sufficiently considered. In response, this paper proposes an interdisciplinary approach that draws on political ecology perspectives to combine sociohydrological insights with analyses of social power and of the ways in which different social groups distinctively interact with water systems. We draw on empirical evidence of Cape Town‚Äôs water insecurity before and during the prolonged drought (2015‚Äì2017) that escalated into a severe water crisis, also known as Day Zero. The study integrates times series of reservoir storage and water consumption with 40 interviews and focus group discussions to firstly retrace the historical legacy of Colonial rules, Apartheid and, more recently, neoliberal policies. Within this human-water system, we show how Cape Town‚Äôs political legacy has encouraged unsustainable levels of water consumption amongst the (white) elite and tolerated chronic water insecurity amongst (black) informal dwellers. This uneven geography of water insecurity is also discernible in the unequal experiences of drought and water resilience trajectories of diverse social groups across Cape Town. We conclude that accounting for social power and inequalities can advance sociohydrology by identifying those mechanisms (within society) that determine what water is secured and what human-water interactions and dynamics will be sustained over time. Furthermore, by engaging with social power, sociohydrology can play a significant role in informing policies that reduce inequalities in water access and unsustainable water use.  aPublisher supplied data 3adrought 3afocus groups 3ageography 3ahumans 3ahydrology 3apolitics 3arain 3asociety 0aUnequal water insecurity 0aSocial inequalities 0aPolitical ecology 0aLegacy 0aDroughts 0aSociohydrology 0aSocial power1 aRusca, Maria1 aCloke, Hannah1 aDi Baldassarre, Giuliano0 tJournal of hydrology.g2021 Mar., v. 594 p.125953-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl46539x0022-16947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2020.1259533Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03067naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005500148245008800203300001800291500001100309520161400320592002801934596005901962650001702021650001702038650002102055650001902076650001502095650002302110650002502133650001202158650001502170650001202185650001702197650001502214650002202229650001902251650001202270650002202282700001702304700001202321700001602333700001902349773012502368856008302493852000902576655001202585IND60794786020221123003959.0220929e202210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079478602DNAL7 a10.1007/s11033-022-07513-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYan, Siyuan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4127-904X14aThe role of PFKFB3 in maintaining colorectal cancer cell proliferation and stemness  ap. 9877-9891.  aReview  aSince generally confronting with the hypoxic and stressful microenvironment, cancer cells alter their glucose metabolism pattern to glycolysis to sustain the continuous proliferation and vigorous biological activities. Bifunctional 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase (PFK-2/FBPase-2) isoform 3 (PFKFB3) functions as an effectively modulator of glycolysis and also participates in regulating angiogenesis, cell death and cell stemness. Meanwhile, PFKFB3 is highly expressed in a variety of cancer cells, and can be activated by several regulatory factors, such as hypoxia, inflammation and cellular signals. In colorectal cancer (CRC) cells, PFKFB3 not only has the property of high expression, but also probably relate to inflammation-cancer transformation. Recent studies indicate that PFKFB3 is involved in chemoradiotherapy resistance as well, such as breast cancer, endometrial cancer and CRC. Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are self-renewable cell types that contribute to oncogenesis, metastasis and relapse. Several studies indicate that CSCs utilize glycolysis to fulfill their energetic and biosynthetic demands in order to maintain rapid proliferation and adapt to the tumor microenvironment changes. In addition, elevated PFKFB3 has been reported to correlate with self-renewal and metastatic outgrowth in numerous kinds of CSCs. This review summarizes our current understanding of PFKFB3 roles in modulating cancer metabolism to maintain cell proliferation and stemness, and discusses its feasibility as a potential target for the discovery of antineoplastic agents, especially in CRC.  aPublisher supplied data  a31801169cNational Natural Science Foundation of China 3aangiogenesis 3abiosynthesis 3abreast neoplasms 3acarcinogenesis 3acell death 3acell proliferation 3acolorectal neoplasms 3aglucose 3aglycolysis 3ahypoxia 3ainflammation 3ametastasis 3amolecular biology 3aneoplasm cells 3arelapse 3auterine neoplasms1 aLi, Qianqian1 aLi, Shi1 aAi, Zhiying1 aYuan, Dongdong0 tMolecular biology reports.g2022 Oct., v. 49, no. 10 p.9877-9891dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl5510x0301-48517nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11033-022-07513-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02872naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245011900168300001600287520151100303592002801814650002101842650002001863650001001883650001501893650001501908650002701923650001101950650002201961651001501983651001301998651001202011700002202023700002202045700002102067700002102088700002102109700001702130700002002147700003402167700002102201700002102222773010202243856004802345852000902393655001202402IND50090523420221118005702.0140621e201406  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5009052342DNAL7 a10.1134/S10227954140401272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSemerikov, V. L.10aMicrosatellite loci polymorphism of chloroplast DNA of scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) in Asia and eastern Europe  ap. 577-585.  aThe variability of four microsatellite loci of chloroplast DNA was studied in 38 populations of Pinus sylvestris in the European part of Russia, in Siberia, Kazakhstan, Transbaikalia and Mongolia. High variability was observed in all regions. In total, 152 haplotypes were identified. The level of population differentiation R ST was 2.1%. The differentiation of three geographical groups of populations (European, Siberian-Kazakhstan and Transbaikalian-Mongolian) was insignificant (R CT = 0.004). At the same time, some rare haplotypes were found to be specific for a certain geographical region. Distribution of the rare haplotypes, which differentiated European populations from Asian populations and Mongolian and Transbaikalian populations from the Siberian, showed the independence of the history of these regions. This corresponds more to the hypothesis that the modern area of Pinus sylvestris originated via settlement from many origins than to the hypothesized single center of the post-glacial recolonization. The distribution of the pairwise differences between the individual specimens corresponded to the model of sudden population growth. The assessments of the age of this event for Pinus sylvestris (4.5‚Äì4.7 million years), which were obtained on the basis of this model, significantly exceeded the age of the Quaternary. Therefore, the revealed population growth is hardly due to the changes in flora related with the glaciation, but rather mirrors the moment of the species formation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPinus sylvestris 3achloroplast DNA 3aflora 3aglaciation 3ahaplotypes 3amicrosatellite repeats 3amodels 3apopulation growth 3aKazakhstan 3aMongolia 3aSiberia1 aSemerikova, S.

Blood-fed mosquitoes were collected from 91 different sites throughout Connecticut over a 6-yr period (June-October 2002-2007), and the host-feeding patterns of 23 mosquito species representing six genera were examined by using a polymerase chain reaction-based assay and sequencing portions of the cytochrome b gene of mitochondrial DNA. This study was part of a statewide surveillance program and for some of the mosquito species a limited number of specimens were examined [e.g., Aedes communis (De Geer) (1), Anopheles barberi Coquillett (1), Uranotaenia sapphirina (Osten Sacken) (5)]. With the exception of Culex territans Walker that acquired bloodmeals from all four classes of vertebrates--birds, reptiles, amphibians, and mammals--all species of Aedes, Anopheles, Coquillettidia, Psorophora, and to a lesser degree, Uranotaenia, were found to feed predominately upon mammalian hosts. Fourteen mammalian species were identified as sources of blood, but the majority of feedings were taken from the white-tailed deer, Odocoileus virginianus. Human-derived bloodmeals were identified from 13 of the 23 mosquito species. Limited avian-derived bloodmeals were detected in Aedes canadensis (Theobald), Aedes cantator (Coquillett), Aedes cinereus Meigen, Aedes triseriatus (Coquillett), Aedes trivittatus (Coquillett), Coquillettidia perturbans (Walker) Cx. territans, Psorophora ferox (von Humboldt), and Ur. sapphirina. American robin, Turdus migratorius, was the most common source of avian blood, followed by a few other mostly Passeriformes birds. We conclude that the white-tailed deer serve as the main vertebrate host for these mammalophilic mosquitoes in this region of the United States. This feeding pattern supports enzootic amplification of arboviruses, including Jamestown Canyon, Cache Valley, and Potosi viruses that perpetuate in cervid hosts. Occasional feeding on avian hosts suggests that some of these mosquito species, such as Cq. perturbans, also could facilitate transmission of West Nile and eastern equine encephalitis viruses from viremic birds to mammalian hosts. 3aCulex 3asequence analysis 3avector competence 3aUranotaenia 3aCoquillettidia 3aPsorophora 3ahosts 3amitochondrial DNA 3ahematophagy 3aarboviruses 3ainsect vectors 3acytochrome b 3aAnopheles 3aAedes 2aAnimals 2aCulicidaexphysiology 2aCytochromes bxgenetics 2aDNA, Mitochondrialxchemistry 2aFemale 2aFood Preferences 2aHost-Parasite Interactions 2aHumans 2aInsect Vectorsxphysiology 2aPolymerase Chain Reaction 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 3aConnecticut 0aConnecticut 0ahost identification 0abloodmeal sources 0ablood-feeding behavior 0ahuman hosts 0avertebrate hosts 0afeeding behavior1 aAndreadis, Theodore G.1 aArmstrong, P.

Previous studies yield conflicting results and thus far no studies have undertaken the interaction of body mass index (BMI) and physical activity with protein intakes in relation to BMC and bone mineral density (BMD). OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the associations of dietary total protein (TP), animal protein (AP) and plant protein (PP) intakes with BMC and BMD and their changes. We tested also the interactions of protein intake with, obesity (BMI ‚â§30 vs. >30 kg/m2) and physical activity level (passive vs. active). DESIGN/ SETTING: Prospective cohort study (Osteoporosis Risk-Factor and Fracture-Prevention Study). PARTICIPANTS/MEASURES: At the baseline, 554 women aged 65-72 years filled out a 3-day food record and a questionnaire covering data on lifestyle, physical activity, diseases, and medications. Intervention group received calcium 1000 mg/d and cholecalciferol 800 IU for 3 years. Control group received neither supplementation nor placebo. Bone density was measured at baseline and year 3, using dual energy x-ray absorptiometry. Multivariable regression analyses were conducted to examine the associations between protein intake and BMD and BMC. RESULTS: In cross-sectional analyses energy-adjusted TP (P‚â§0¬∑029) and AP (P‚â§0¬∑045) but not PP (g/d) were negatively associated with femoral neck (FN) BMD and BMC. Women with TP‚â•1¬∑2 g/kg/body weight (BW) (Ptrend‚â§0¬∑009) had lower FN, lumbar spine (LS) and total BMD and BMC. In follow-up analysis, TP (g/kg/BW) was inversely associated with LS BMD and LS BMC. The detrimental associations were stronger in women with BMI<30 kg/m¬≤. In active women, TP (g/kg/BW) was positively associated with LS BMD and FN BMC changes. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests detrimental associations between protein intake and bone health. However, these negative associations maybe counteracted by BMI>30 kg/m2 and physical activity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal proteins 3abody mass index 3abone density 3acalcium 3acholecalciferol 3acohort studies 3across-sectional studies 3adual-energy X-ray absorptiometry 3aelderly 3afemur 3afood records 3alifestyle 3alumbar spine 3amineral content 3aobesity 3aosteoporosis 3aphysical activity 3aplacebos 3aprotein content 3aprotein intake 3aquestionnaires 3aregression analysis 3awomen1 aSirola, J.1 aMursu, J.1 aKr√∂ger, H.1 aTuppurainen, M.1 aErkkil√§, A.

A conceptual model based on the concept of green organizational responses is developed in this paper. The model is tested using structural equation modeling on a sample of 427 manufacturing organizations in six provinces in central China. The results of modeling show that regulatory and customer pressure promotes green organizational responses and enhances green innovation performance. However, these two forms of pressure are shown to have different impacts on specific organizational responses and different extent of impact on green innovation performance. For example, while regulatory pressure has significant positive impact on training and plays a direct role in green innovation performance, customer pressure has significant positive impact on research and development investments and collaboration networks. These results offer important implications for promoting green innovations in the manufacturing industry.  aPublisher supplied data 3aconsumer demand 3aindustrial organization and market structure 3amodels 3aresearch and development 3astructural equation modeling 3asustainable manufacturing 3asustainable technology 3aChina 0aRegulatory pressure 0aCustomer pressure 0aGreen organizational responses 0aGreen innovation performance1 aHu, Zhen-peng1 aLiu, Cun-shan1 aYu, Da-jin1 aYu, Liu-fang0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2016 Jan. 20, v. 112 p.3423-3433dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2015.10.1063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02637naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004500094040001800139100001900157245011500176300001600291520120800307592002801515650001601543650001801559650002001577650001901597650002001616650001701636650001801653650001101671650002001682650003201702650001401734650001701748650002101765650001301786650002801799650001101827650001301838650003601851650003101887700001901918773010701937856009102044990002302135852000902158655001202167IND60098745120221122042828.0141105e20120715xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009874512DNAL7 a10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2012.05.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQueisser, Nina10aAldosterone, oxidative stress, and NF-Œ∫B activation in hypertension-related cardiovascular and renal diseases  ap. 314-327.  aThe mineralocorticoid aldosterone regulates electrolyte and fluid balance and is involved in blood pressure homoeostasis. Classically, it binds to its intracellular mineralocorticoid receptor to induce expression of proteins influencing the reabsorption of sodium and water in the distal nephron. Aldosterone gained special attention when large clinical studies showed that blocking its receptor in patients with cardiovascular diseases reduced their mortality. These patients present increased plasma aldosterone levels. The exact mechanisms of the potential toxic effects of aldosterone leading to cardiovascular damage are not known yet. The observation of reduced nitric oxide bioavailability in hyperaldosteronism implied the generation of oxidative stress by aldosterone. Subsequent studies confirmed the increase of oxidative stress markers in patients with chronic heart failure and in animal models of hyperaldosteronism. The effects of reactive oxygen species have been related to the activation of transcription factors, such as NF-Œ∫B. This review summarizes the present-day knowledge of aldosterone-induced oxidative stress and NF-Œ∫B activation in humans and different experimental models.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaldosterone 3aanimal models 3abioavailability 3ablood pressure 3aclinical trials 3aelectrolytes 3aheart failure 3ahumans 3akidney diseases 3amineralocorticoid receptors 3amortality 3anitric oxide 3aoxidative stress 3apatients 3areactive oxygen species 3asodium 3atoxicity 3atranscription factor NF-kappa B 3atranscriptional activation1 aSchupp, Nicole0 tFree radical biology & medicine.g2012 July 15, v. 53, no. 2 p.314-327dElsevier Inc.x0891-58497nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2012.05.0113Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02301naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245011400167300001600281520115600297592002801453650001601481650002201497650000801519650003201527650001601559650001401575650001401589650003901603650001101642650003001653650002101683650001201704700001701716700002301733773010201756856004801858852000901906655001201915IND50090523520221118005555.0140621e201406  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5009052352DNAL7 a10.1134/S102279541404005X2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKiseleva, A.

We identified the putative Ty3/gypsy centromeric retrotransposons (CR) among the DNA sequences of A. cepa present in the NCBI database and evaluated their copy number in the genomes of A. cepa and A. fistulosum. The putative copy number of Ty3/gypsy CR constituted about 26000 for A. cepa and about 7000 for A. fistulosum. The chromosomal organization of Ty3/gypsy CR was analyzed with fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH). Primers were designed using the sequence ET645811 of A. cepa (Genome Survey Sequence database), and a 300 bp product was obtained from genomic DNA of A. cepa and A. fistulosum. The PCR product displayed similarity to the reverse transcriptase of the CR Ty3/gypsy family and was used as a probe for FISH. Hybridization signals were mainly localized in the centromeric regions of A. cepa chromosomes. On the chromosomes of A. fistulosum, however, the hybridization patterns were less specific. The evolution of the CR Ty3/gypsy in these two closely related Allium species is discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAllium cepa 3aAllium fistulosum 3aDNA 3aRNA-directed DNA polymerase 3achromosomes 3adatabases 3aevolution 3afluorescence in situ hybridization 3agenome 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aretrotransposons 3asurveys1 aKirov, I.

Pronounced trends, determined by the climate and anthropogenic components have been identified. Up to the 1970s, at a drop in lake water level, the ecosystem still showed the main features of a shallow water body overgrown with macrophytes. Water level rise caused a more intense development of phytoplankton, an increase in biogenic element concentrations, a decrease in water transparency and the contribution of cyanobacteria of S‚ÇÅ codon; pondweed disappeared almost completely. Step-by-step regression analysis of phytoplankton development indices and hydrological characteristics showed that water transparency in Lake Nero depends by 80% directly on water exchange and inversely on the concentration of chlorophyll a in seston. The main hypothesis of the study was confirmed: the key trigger in phytoplankton‚Äìmacrophytes competition is water level rise.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCyanobacteria 3acase studies 3achlorophyll 3aclimate 3aecosystems 3aeutrophication 3alakes 3amacrophytes 3aphytoplankton 3aregression analysis 3aseston 3asurface water1 aSidelev, S.

The aim of this study was to investigate the cytokine profile induced upon S. suis infection of blood, to determine the cellular sources of those cytokines, and to study the potential effects of the induced cytokines on bacterial killing. We measured TNF-Œ±, IL-6, IFN-Œ≥, IL-17A and IL-10 after an experimental intravenous infection with S. suis serotype 2 in vivo, and analyzed whole blood, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and separated leukocytes to identify the cytokine-producing cell type(s). In addition, we used a reconstituted whole blood assay to investigate the effect of TNF-Œ± on bacterial killing in the presence of different S. suis-specific IgG levels. An increase in IL-6 and IL-10, but not in IFN-Œ≥ or IL-17A, was observed in two of three piglets with pronounced bacteremia 16 to 20 h after infection, but not in piglets with controlled bacteremia. Our results confirmed previous findings that S. suis induces TNF-Œ± and IL-6 and could demonstrate that TNF-Œ± is produced by monocytes in vitro. We further found that IL-10 induction resulted in reduced secretion of TNF-Œ± and IL-6. Rapid induction of TNF-Œ± was, however, not crucial for in vitro bacterial killing, not even in the absence of specific IgG.  aPublisher supplied data 3aStreptococcus 3aassays 3abacteremia 3ainterleukin-10 3ainterleukin-17 3ainterleukin-6 3aintravenous injection 3amonocytes 3apathogens 3apiglets 3asecretion 3aserotypes 3aweaning1 aMeurer, Marita 1 ade Buhr, Nicole 1 avon K√∂ckritz-Blickwede, Maren 1 aBaums, Christoph  G.1 aAlber, Gottfried 1 aSch√ºtze, Nicole 0 tPathogens.g2020 Jan. 03, v. 9, no. 1dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27146x2076-08177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/pathogens90100403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02034naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100006400146245009300210300001800303500001900321520093000340592002801270650002201298650001501320650000901335650001501344650001701359700006101376700005901437773013501496856008001631852000901711655001201720IND60741311120221117220640.0210610e20210526xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074131112DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcb.1c024122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChakraborty, Debayan1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4339-581810aSide-Chain Polarity Modulates the Intrinsic Conformational Landscape of Model Dipeptides  ap. 5809-5822.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe intrinsic conformational preferences of small peptides may provide additional insight into the thermodynamics and kinetics of protein folding. In this study, we explore the underlying energy landscapes of two model peptides, namely, Ac-Ala-NH‚ÇÇ and Ac-Ser-NH‚ÇÇ, using geometry-optimization-based tools developed within the context of energy landscape theory. We analyze not only how side-chain polarity influences the structural preferences of the dipeptides, but also other emergent properties of the landscape, including heat capacity profiles, and kinetics of conformational rearrangements. The contrasting topographies of the free energy landscape agree with recent results from Fourier transform microwave spectroscopy experiments, where Ac-Ala-NH‚ÇÇ was found to exist as a mixture of two conformers, while Ac-Ser-NH‚ÇÇ remained structurally locked, despite exhibiting an apparently rich conformational landscape.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGibbs free energy 3adipeptides 3aheat 3alandscapes 3aspectroscopy1 aBanerjee, Atreyee1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0518-609X1 aWales, David J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3555-66450 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2021 May 26, v. 125, no. 22 p.5809-5822dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19284x1520-52077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcb.1c024123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01964naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100006200146245006800208300001800276500001900294520106000313592002801373650001501401650001901416650001101435650001601446773013501462856008001597852000901677655001201686IND60741311220221117220814.0210610e20210528xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074131122DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcb.1c024172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKlauda, Jeffery B.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8725-187010aConsiderations of Recent All-Atom Lipid Force Field Development  ap. 5676-5682.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aMolecular simulations of biological molecules require an accurate description of molecular interactions through a force field (FF). The focus of this Perspective is on all-atom lipid FFs. Recent additions to the CHARMM36 lipid FF continue to expand a researcher‚Äôs ability to probe membrane structure and function with a wide variety of biologically important lipids. Currently, there is an effort to reduce the assumptions in all-atom lipid FFs. The inclusion of long-range dispersion interaction through particle-mesh Ewald is allowing for more accurate descriptions of lipid bilayer and monolayer properties without additional computational cost. Soon, simulations with lipid FFs will no longer depend on short-range cutoffs and will accurately represent long-range dispersion. This requires efficient FF parametrization with an automated approach due to FF complexity. In addition, polarizable FFs for lipids will be important for the next generation of simulations that accurately represent how molecule interactions respond to a varied environment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aautomation 3alipid bilayers 3alipids 3aresearchers0 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2021 May 28, v. 125, no. 22 p.5676-5682dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19284x1520-52077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcb.1c024173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02744naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001300147245013800160300001600298520150900314592002801823650002201851650001401873650001001887650001401897650001201911650002501923650001101948650001501959650002401974650000901998651001002007700001102017700001102028700001302039700001402052700001302066700001202079700001902091773011002110856008102220852000902301655001202310IND60575164020221118163711.0170728e201706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057516402DNAL7 a10.1007/s12603-016-0798-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, C.10aFrailty in relation to the risk of Alzheimer‚Äôs disease, dementia, and death in older Chinese adults: A seven-year prospective study  ap. 648-654.  aOBJECTIVES: To explore the relationship of general health decline assessed by frailty and risk of dementia and Alzheimer‚Äôs disease (AD). DESIGN: A seven-year prospective cohort study. SETTING: Secondary analysis of data from the Beijing Longitudinal Study on Aging. PARTICIPANTS: Urban and rural communitydwelling people aged 60 and older at baseline. MEASUREMENTS: Frailty was quantified using the deficit accumulation-based frailty index (FI), constructed from 40 health deficits at baseline. Dementia was diagnosed by DSM-IIIR. AD and vascular dementia (VaD) were diagnosed by NINCDS-ADRDA and NINDS-AIREN. The relationships between frailty and the risk of dementia, AD and death were evaluated through multivariable models. RESULTS: Of 2788 participants at baseline (1997), 171 (11.1%) reported a history of dementia. In seven years, 351 people developed dementia (13%: 223 AD and 128 other types of dementia) and 813 died (29%). After adjustment for age, sex, education, and baseline cognition, baseline frailty status significantly associated with Alzheimer‚Äôs disease and dementia and death. For each deficit accumulated, the odds ratio of death increased by 5.7%, and the odds ratio of dementia increased by 2.9% (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Frailty was associated with Alzheimer‚Äôs disease and dementia over a seven years period. Frailty index might facilitate the identification of older adults at high risk of dementia for the application of the most effective, targeted prevention strategies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAlzheimer disease 3acognition 3adeath 3aeducation 3aelderly 3alongitudinal studies 3amodels 3aodds ratio 3aprospective studies 3arisk 3aChina1 aJi, X.1 aWu, X.1 aTang, Z.1 aZhang, X.1 aGuan, S.1 aLiu, H.1 aFang, Xianghua0 tjournal of nutrition, health & aging.g2017 June, v. 21, no. 6 p.648-654dSpringer Parisx1279-77077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12603-016-0798-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02880naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004500094040001800139100001700157245014000174300001600314520145800330592002801788650001701816650002501833650001401858650002201872650002001894650001001914650002801924650002101952650001101973650001301984650002101997650002102018650002902039650002602068650001702094700002002111700002202131700002202153700001702175773010702192856009102299990002302390852000902413655001202422IND60098745420221122042815.0141105e20120715xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009874542DNAL7 a10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2012.04.0322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKusano, Yuri10aConstitutive expression of an antioxidant enzyme, glutathione S-transferase P1, during differentiation of human intestinal Caco-2 cells  ap. 347-356.  aIn this study, we investigated the molecular mechanism of the constitutive expression of an antioxidant enzyme, glutathione S-transferase (GST), during differentiation of human intestinal epithelial Caco-2 cells. We observed that the class œÄ GST isozyme (GST P1) expression correlated with the increased expression of caudal-related homeodomain protein 2 (CDX2), a member of the mammalian homeobox family of transcription factors. In addition, transfection of Caco-2 cells with the human CDX2 cDNA resulted in enhanced expression of the GST P1 gene and protein. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay demonstrated that CDX2 binds to the GST P1 promoter containing the putative consensus CDX-binding element, TTTAC, located at ‚àí247 upstream from the established site for transcription initiation. Using the dsDNA pull-down assay, it was revealed that CDX2 recognized and bound to the putative consensus CDX-binding element within the human GST P1 promoter region and that the amount of the CDX2 bound to the putative consensus CDX-binding element increased during Caco-2 cell differentiation. Furthermore, we demonstrated that CDX2 formed the transcriptional complex with Sp1 and bound to the putative consensus CDX-binding element within the human GST P1 promoter region. These data suggest that CDX2 binds to the human GST P1 promoter via complex formation with Sp1 and controls the constitutive expression of GST P1 during Caco-2 cell differentiation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantioxidants 3acell differentiation 3achromatin 3acomplementary DNA 3agene expression 3agenes 3aglutathione transferase 3ahuman cell lines 3ahumans 3aisozymes 3aprecipitin tests 3apromoter regions 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranscription factors 3atransfection1 aHorie, Shunsuke1 aMorishita, Nozomi1 aShibata, Takahiro1 aUchida, Koji0 tFree radical biology & medicine.g2012 July 15, v. 53, no. 2 p.347-356dElsevier Inc.x0891-58497nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2012.04.0323Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02777naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245016400172300001400336500001900350520117000369592002801539650002301567650002501590650002401615650002401639650002101663650001701684650001601701650001701717650001101734650001101745650001301756650002301769650001901792650001401811650001601825653004101841653001401882653002301896700003101919700001901950700002101969700002601990700001902016773014202035856008502177852000902262655001202271IND60689510620221123010840.0200422e20160102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068951062DNAL7 a10.3109/09637486.2015.11265632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKomes, Dra≈æenka10aConsumer acceptability of liquorice root (Glycyrrhiza glabra L.) as an alternative sweetener and correlation with its bioactive content and biological activity  ap. 53-66.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aConsumer acceptability and sensory properties of liquorice root (Glycyrrhiza glabra L.) were evaluated. Quantitation of total polyphenolics and glycyrrhizic acid (GA), as well as the antioxidant capacity of liquorice extracts, was conducted and their biological effects (cytotoxic, antioxidative/pro-oxidative activity, lipid peroxidation on human laryngeal carcinoma cell line) compared to the ones of their predominant bioactive compound ‚Äì GA. Conducted consumer survey revealed poor familiarity with liquorice (12.37% of correspondents), but willingness towards its use as an alternative sweetener (77.32% of consumers). Polyphenolic content of evaluated extracts ranged from 1018.18 to 1277.27‚Äâmg gallic acid equivalents (GAE)/l while GA content varied between 2179.53 and 2944.13‚Äâmg/l. The most pronounced cytotoxic effect (60%) and lipid peroxidation were exerted by treatment with the highest applied extract concentrations (10‚Äâmg/ml). Pure GA exhibited cytotoxic and pro-oxidative effects at concentrations of 0.12‚Äì0.6‚Äâmg/ml. Due to high GA content, coupled with its pronounced cytotoxic activity, the intake of liquorice root should be limited.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGlycyrrhiza glabra 3aantioxidant activity 3abioactive compounds 3aconsumer acceptance 3aconsumer surveys 3acytotoxicity 3agallic acid 3aglycyrrhizin 3ahumans 3alarynx 3alicorice 3alipid peroxidation 3aneoplasm cells 3anutrition 3apolyphenols 0aAntioxidative/pro-oxidative activity 0aliquorice 0asensory properties1 aBel≈°ƒçak-Cvitanoviƒá, Ana1 aJuriƒá, Slaven1 aBu≈°iƒá, Arijana1 aVojvodiƒá, Aleksandra1 aDurgo, Ksenija0 tInternational journal of food sciences and nutrition.g2016 Jan. 2, v. 67, no. 1 p.53-66dTaylor & FranciswJournal:2066x1465-34787nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3109/09637486.2015.11265633Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01555naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002000139245013100159300001800290520058000308592002800888650001900916650001600935650002300951650002300974650001400997650003001011700002201041773010601063856007501169852000901244655001201253IND60578461720221117164901.0170813e20121102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057846172DNAL7 a10.1021/ol30265232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aClarke, Paul A.10aSynthesis of the C20‚ÄìC32 Tetrahydropyran Core of the Phorboxazoles and the C22 Epimer via a Stereodivergent Michael Reaction  ap. 5550-5553.  aA stereoselective synthesis of the C20‚ÄìC32 tetrahydropyran core of the phorboxazoles has been achieved in only seven steps and in a 31% overall yield.

However, when the silyl ether deprotection/oxy-Michael cyclization was conducted under fluoride conditions buffered with acetic acid, the C22 epimer of the core was the sole product.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBronsted acids 3aacetic acid 3achemical reactions 3achemical structure 3afluorides 3astereoselective synthesis1 aErmanis, Kristaps0 tOrganic letters.g2012 Nov. 02, v. 14, no. 21 p.5550-5553dAmerican Chemical Societyx1523-70527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fol30265233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02962naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100001500166245008700181300001800268520145800286592002801744650001501772650001101787650002001798650001301818650003101831650001301862650001101875650002201886650002401908650001501932650001901947650001401966650002201980650001302002650001302015650001002028650001602038650001702054650002402071700001602095700001902111700002002130700002002150700001302170700001402183700001602197700002102213773008402234856008102318852000902399655001202408IND50089836520221118004301.0150215e201406  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008983652DNAL7 a245732242pmid7 a10.1007/s00425-014-2040-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDeng, Gang10aComparative proteome analysis of the response of ramie under N, P and K deficiency  ap. 1175-1186.  aRamie is an important natural fiber. There has been little research on the molecular mechanisms of ramie related to the absorption, utilization and metabolism of nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and potassium (K). One approach to reveal the mechanisms of N, P and K (NPK) utilization and metabolism in ramie is comparative proteome analysis. The differentially expressed proteins in the leaves of ramie were analyzed by proteome analysis after 6¬†days of N- and K-deficient treatments and 3¬†days of P-deficient treatment using MALDI-TOF/TOF mass spectrometry and 32, 27 and 51 differential proteins were obtained, respectively. These proteins were involved in photosynthesis, protein destination and storage, energy metabolism, primary metabolism, disease/defense, signal transduction, cell structure, transcription, secondary metabolism and protein synthesis. Ramie responded to NPK stress by enhancing secondary metabolism and reducing photosynthesis and energy metabolism to increase endurance. Specifically, ramie adapted to NPK deficiency by increasing signal transduction pathways, enhancing the connection between glycolysis and photosynthesis, promoting the intracellular flow of carbon and N; promoting the synthesis cysteine and related hormones and upregulating actin protein to promote growth of the root system. The experimental results provide important information for further study on the high-efficiency NPK utilization mechanism of ramie.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3acarbon 3acell structures 3acysteine 3agene expression regulation 3ahormones 3aleaves 3amass spectrometry 3anitrogen metabolism 3aphosphorus 3aphotosynthesis 3apotassium 3aprotein synthesis 3aproteins 3aproteome 3aramie 3aroot growth 3aroot systems 3asignal transduction1 aLiu, Li Jun1 aZhong, Xin Yue1 aLao, Cheng Ying1 aWang, Hong Yang1 aWang, Bo1 aZhu, Cong1 aShah, Fahad1 aPeng, Ding Xiang0 tPlanta.g2014 June, v. 239, no. 6 p.1175-1186dSpringer-Verlagx0032-09357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00425-014-2040-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02500naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006600148245009000214300002000304500001100324520130800335592002801643650002301671650002601694650002701720650001701747650001401764650001401778650002501792650002001817650002201837650001801859650001701877650001301894773012701907856008302034852000902117655001202126IND60794786620221122222824.0220929e202210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079478662DNAL7 a10.1007/s11033-022-07572-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMabrouk, Dalia Mamdouh1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8535-935910aAntimicrobial peptides: features, applications and the potential use against covid-19  ap. 10039-10050.  aReview  aBACKGROUND: Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are a diverse class of molecules that represent a vital part of innate immunity. AMPs are evolutionarily conserved molecules that exhibit structural and functional diversity. They provide a possible solution to the antibiotic-resistance crisis. MAIN TEXT: These small cationic peptides can target bacteria, fungi, and viruses, as well as cancer cells. Their unique action mechanisms, rare antibiotic-resistant variants, broad-spectrum activity, low toxicity, and high specificity encourage pharmaceutical industries to conduct clinical trials to develop them as therapeutic drugs. The rapid development of computer-assisted strategies accelerated the identification of AMPs. The Antimicrobial Peptide Database (APD) so far contains 3324 AMPs from different sources. In addition to their applications in different fields, some AMPs demonstrated the potential to combat COVID-19, and hinder viral infectivity in diverse ways. CONCLUSIONS: This review provides a brief history of AMPs and their features, including classification, evolution, sources and mechanisms of action, biosynthesis pathway, and identification techniques. Furthermore, their different applications, challenges to clinical applications, and their potential use against COVID-19 are presented.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCOVID-19 infection 3aantibiotic resistance 3aantimicrobial peptides 3abiosynthesis 3adatabases 3aevolution 3afunctional diversity 3ainnate immunity 3amolecular biology 3apathogenicity 3atherapeutics 3atoxicity0 tMolecular biology reports.g2022 Oct., v. 49, no. 10 p.10039-10050dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl5510x0301-48517nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11033-022-07572-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02285naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245013200172300001400304500001900318520097600337592002801313650002801341650001501369650001001384650001201394650002601406650001401432650001301446653001901459653002101478653001501499653001601514700001501530700002201545700002301567700001701590700002001607773014201627856008501769852000901854655001201863IND60689510920221123010640.0200422e20160102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068951092DNAL7 a10.3109/09637486.2015.11265642doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMaruyama, Michio14aThe effects of non-viable Lactobacillus on immune function in the elderly: a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study  ap. 67-73.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aForty-two participants in two nursing homes who were‚Äâ‚â•65 years of age were randomised to receive a jelly containing 10 billion heat-killed Lactobacillus paracasei MCC1849 cells (LP group) or a placebo jelly without lactobacilli (placebo group) for 6 weeks.

Spatially structured ecological networks are often used to represent spatial landscape‚Äêgenetic relationships, where nodes represent individuals or populations and resistance to movement is represented using non‚Äêbinary edge weights. Weights are typically assigned or estimated by the user, rather than observed, and validating such weights is challenging. We provide a synthesis of current methods used to estimate edge weights and an overview of common model types, stressing the advantages and disadvantages of each approach and their ability to model landscape‚Äêgenetic data. We further explore a set of spatial‚Äêstatistical methods that provide ecologists with alternative approaches for modeling spatially explicit processes that may affect genetic structure. This includes an overview of spatial autoregressive models, with a particular focus on how correlation and partial correlation are used to represent neighborhood structure with the inverse of the covariance matrix (i.e., precision matrix). We then demonstrate how to model resistance by specifying an appropriate statistical model on the nodes, conditioned on the edge weights, through the precision matrix. This integration of network ecology and spatial statistics provides a practical analytical framework for landscape‚Äêgenetic studies. The results can be used to make statistical inferences about the relative importance of individual landscape characteristics, such as the vegetative cover, hillslope, or the presence of roads or rivers, on gene flow. In addition, the R code we include allows readers to explore landscape‚Äêgenetic structure in their own datasets, which will potentially provide new insights into the evolutionary processes that generated ecological networks, as well as valuable information about the optimal characteristics of conservation corridors.  aPublisher supplied data  a1614392cThe National Science Foundation, Division of Mathematical Sciences 3acomputer software 3adata collection 3aecologists 3agene flow 3alandscape genetics 3alandscapes 3arivers 3aroads 3astatistical inference 3astatistical models 3atopographic slope 3avariance covariance matrix1 aHanks, Ephraim M.1 aHooten, Mevin B.1 aVer Hoef, Jay M.1 aFortin, Marie‚ÄêJos√©e0 tEcological monographs.g2019 May, v. 89, no. 2 p.e01355-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:19342x0012-96157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ecm.13553Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02979naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094024002200128024001900150040001800169100002500187245007400212506007600286520153000362592002801892506003701920650002401957650002701981650002102008650001202029650001002041650001502051650001802066650000902084650002802093650001602121650001302137651001202150700002102162700002302183700003202206700002102238700001902259700002002278773012202298856008002420852000902500655001202509IND60650830320221207113638.0190710e20190329xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065083032DNAL7 a10.3390/pathogens80200422doi7 aPMC66303322pmcid7 a309348552pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHellenbrand, Wiebke 10aEpidemiology of Tick-Borne Encephalitis (TBE) in Germany, 2001‚Äì2018  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aWe reviewed tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) surveillance and epidemiology in Germany, as these underlie public health recommendations, foremost vaccination. We performed descriptive analyses of notification data (2001&ndash;2018, n = 6063) according to region, demographics and clinical manifestations and calculated incidence trends using negative binomial regression. Risk areas were defined based on incidence in administrative districts. Most cases (89%) occurred in the federal states of Baden-Wurttemberg and Bavaria, where annual TBE incidence fluctuated markedly between 0.7&ndash;2.0 cases/100,000 inhabitants. A slight but significantly increasing temporal trend was observed from 2001&ndash;2018 (age-adjusted incidence rate ratio (IRR) 1.02 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.01&ndash;1.04)), primarily driven by high case numbers in 2017&ndash;2018. Mean incidence was highest in 40&ndash;69-year-olds and in males. More males (23.7%) than females (18.0%, p = 0.02) had severe disease (encephalitis or myelitis), which increased with age, as did case-fatality (0.4% overall; 2.1% among &ge;70-year-olds). Risk areas increased from 129 districts in 2007 to 161 in 2019. Expansion occurred mainly within existent southern endemic areas, with slower contiguous north-eastern and patchy north-western spread. Median vaccination coverage at school entry in risk areas in 2016&ndash;2017 ranged from 20%&ndash;41% in 4 states. Increasing TBE vaccine uptake is an urgent priority, particularly in high-incidence risk areas.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aconfidence interval 3ademographic statistics 3adisease severity 3afemales 3amales 3amonitoring 3apublic health 3arisk 3atick-borne encephalitis 3avaccination 3avaccines 3aGermany1 aKreusch, Teresa 1 aB√∂hmer, Merle  M.1 aWagner-Wiening, Christiane 1 aDobler, Gerhard 1 aWichmann, Ole 1 aAltmann, Doris 0 tPathogens.g2019 Mar. 29, v. 8, no. 2dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27146x2076-08177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/pathogens80200423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03644naa a2200673 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100005600147245014600203520157600349592002801925650002001953650002001973650001701993650002502010650001202035650002202047650002302069650002002092650001302112653002402125653000902149653002802158653003202186653002802218653000802246653000802254653000802262653000802270653000902278653000902287653000902296653000702305653000802312653000802320653000802328653000802336653001302344653000702357653000802364653000802372653000902380700006002389700006002449700001702509700001302526700005802539700002102597700001902618700005402637700005802691773011902749856008102868852000902949655001202958IND60722720820221118014425.0210911e20210305xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072272082DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jmb.2020.1667932doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBasak, Sujit1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0684-260X10aProbing Interdomain Linkers and Protein Supertertiary Structure In Vitro and in Live Cells with Fluorescent Protein Resonance Energy Transfer  aMany proteins are composed of independently-folded domains connected by flexible linkers. The primary sequence and length of such linkers can set the effective concentration for the tethered domains, which impacts rates of association and enzyme activity. The length of such linkers can be sensitive to environmental conditions, which raises questions as to how studies in dilute buffer relate to the highly-crowded cellular environment. To examine the role of linkers in domain separation, we measured Fluorescent Protein-Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (FP-FRET) for a series of tandem FPs that varied in the length of their interdomain linkers. We used discrete molecular dynamics to map the underlying conformational distribution, which revealed intramolecular contact states that we confirmed with single molecule FRET. Simulations found that attached FPs increased linker length and slowed conformational dynamics relative to the bare linkers. This makes the CLYs poor sensors of inherent linker properties. However, we also showed that FP-FRET in CLYs was sensitive to solvent quality and macromolecular crowding making them potent environmental sensors. Finally, we targeted the same proteins to the plasma membrane of living mammalian cells to measure FP-FRET in cellulo. The measured FP-FRET when tethered to the plasma membrane was the same as that in dilute buffer. While caveats remain regarding photophysics, this suggests that the supertertiary conformational ensemble of these CLY proteins may not be affected by this specific cellular environment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenergy transfer 3aenzyme activity 3afluorescence 3afluorescent proteins 3amammals 3amolecular biology 3amolecular dynamics 3aplasma membrane 3asolvents 0aFluorescent protein 0aFRET 0aSupertertiary structure 0aDiscrete molecular dynamics 0aMacromolecular crowding 0aAUC 0aCHO 0aCLY 0aDMD 0aeCFP 0aeYFP 0aFRET 0aFP 0aIDR 0aPEG 0aPMT 0aRMS 0aSDS-PAGE 0aSD 0aSEC 0aSAW 0aTIRF1 aSaikia, Nabanita1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0684-260X1 aDougherty, Laura1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1974-76441 aGuo, Zhuojun1 aWu, Fang1 aMindlin, Frank1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0417-70331 aLary, Jeffrey W.1 aCole, James L.1 aDing, Feng1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1850-63361 aBowen, Mark E.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9525-69860 tJournal of molecular biology.g2021 Mar. 05, v. 433, no. 5 p.166793-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12469x0022-28367nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jmb.2020.1667933Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03552naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100002300166245016800189300001800357500001500375520183500390592002802225650001402253650001202267650001102279650001902290650001002309650001402319650001202333650001202345650001302357650003102370650001302401650000902414650001202423650001402435650002202449650001702471650002302488650001602511650001902527650002402546650002402570650001202594650001302606653002502619700002002644700002102664700002302685700002002708700002102728700002702749700002102776773008402797856004802881852000902929655001202938IND50089836720221118004306.0140523e201406  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008983672DNAL7 a245955162pmid7 a10.1007/s00425-014-2043-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMartinez, Cecilia,10aMolecular and functional characterization of CpACS27A gene reveals its involvement in monoecy instability and other associated traits in squash (Cucurbita pepo L.)  ap. 1201-1215.  a2019-12-05  aA number of Cucurbita pepo genotypes showing instable monoecy or partial andromonoecy, i.e. an incomplete conversion of female into bisexual flowers, have been detected. Given that in melon and cucumber andromonoecy is the result of reduction of ethylene production in female floral buds, caused by mutations in the ethylene biosynthesis genes CmACS7 and CsACS2; we have cloned and characterized two related C. pepo genes, CpACS27A and CpACS27B. The molecular structure of CpACS27A and its specific expression in the carpels of female flowers during earlier stages of flower development suggests that this gene is the Cucurbita ortholog of CmACS7 and CsACS2. CpACS27B is likely to be a paralogous pseudogene since it has not been found to be expressed in any of the analyzed tissues. CpACS27A was sequenced in Bolognese (Bog) and Vegetable Spaghetti (Veg), two monoecious inbred lines whose F2 was segregating for partial andromonoecy. The Bog allele of CpACS27A carried a missense mutation that resulted in a substitution of the conserved serine residue in position 176 by an alanine. Segregation analysis indicated that this mutant variant is necessary but not sufficient to confer the andromonoecious phenotype in squash. In concordance with its involvement in stamen arrest, a reduction in CpACS27A expression has been found in bisexual flower buds at earlier stages of development. This reduction in CpACS27A expression was concomitant with a downregulation of other ethylene biosynthesis and signaling genes during earlier and later stages of ovary development. The role of CpACS27A is discussed regarding the regulation of ethylene biosynthesis and signaling genes in the control of andromonoecy-associated traits, such as the delayed maturation of corolla and stigma as well as the parthenocarpic development of the fruit.  aPublisher supplied data 3aflowering 3acorolla 3astigma 3aCucurbita pepo 3apasta 3aphenotype 3aalanine 3acarpels 3agenotype 3agene expression regulation 3asquashes 3abuds 3amonoecy 3acucumbers 3amissense mutation 3ainbred lines 3achemical structure 3apseudogenes 3afemale flowers 3aethylene production 3aovarian development 3amutants 3afruiting 0adevelopmental stages1 aManzano, Susana1 aMeg√≠as, Zoraida1 aBarrera, Alejandro1 aBoualem, Adnane1 aGarrido, Dolores1 aBendahmane, Abdelhafid1 aJamilena, Manuel0 tPlanta.g2014 June, v. 239, no. 6 p.1201-1215dSpringer-Verlagx0032-09357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00425-014-2043-0  aDNAL 7aarticle03076naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002200146245012600168500001400294520153800308592002801846650002301874650001001897650002501907650001401932650001601946650001001962650001401972650001001986650001401996650001302010650001702023650001402040650003002054650001302084650001402097650004402111650001102155650001002166650002102176650001202197651001202209700002402221700002402245700001802269700002502287700002202312773012202334856008102456852000902537655001202546IND60703585920221120032934.0200721e20200105xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070358592DNAL7 a10.3390/pathogens90100442doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDenich, Leann  C.12aA Case-Control Study to Investigate the Serotypes of S. suis Isolates by Multiplex PCR in Nursery Pigs in Ontario, Canada  aNAL-light  aStreptococcus suis naturally inhabits the tonsils and nasal cavities of pigs. Some strains can cause systemic infection, leading to a wide range of diseases. A case-control study was conducted to (i) examine serotypes isolated from systemic sites (blood/meninges/spleen) in cases, (ii) determine whether serotypes in systemic sites were found in upper respiratory sites (tonsil/nasal cavity) of the same cases, and (iii) determine the serotypes in upper respiratory sites of case and farm and pen- matched controls. In total, 606 samples from 128 pigs were cultured for S. suis. The isolates were examined for presence of gdh and recN genes by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and were identified as S. suis if both genes were present. The S. suis isolates were then serotyped using a two step-multiplex PCR. Serotypes 9 (n = 9), (2,1/2) (n = 7) and untypable isolates (n = 7) were most commonly found in systemic sites. Detection of serotypes 9 (p = 0.03) in upper respiratory sites were positively associated with their detection in systemic sites of cases, while a trend was seen with serotype (2,1/2) (p = 0.07). Last, no association between serotypes recovered from upper respiratory sites of cases and controls could be detected. Untypable isolates were detected in high frequency, which warrants further investigation. This study confirms that a variety of serotypes can be found in commercial swine production and shows a difference in serotypes recovered from systemic sites in pigs with clinical signs of S. suis infections.  aPublisher supplied data 3aStreptococcus suis 3ablood 3acase-control studies 3adetection 3aexhibitions 3afarms 3afrequency 3agenes 3ainfection 3ameninges 3anasal cavity 3apathogens 3apolymerase chain reaction 3asampling 3aserotypes 3asigns and symptoms (animals and humans) 3aspleen 3aswine 3aswine production 3atonsils 3aOntario1 aFarzan, Abdolvahab 1 aFriendship, Robert 1 aArndt, Emily 1 aGottschalk, Marcelo 1 aPoljak, Zvonimir 0 tPathogens.g2020 Jan. 05, v. 9, no. 1dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27146x2076-08177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/pathogens90100443Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02235naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002500152245009400177300001600271520104700287592002801334650001601362650001101378650001501389650001801404650001701422650002001439650001501459651001001474653000901484653000801493653000801501653001101509653002001520653002301540653001201563653001001575700003001585773010201615856008701717852000901804655001201813IND60568489820221118140805.0190405e201710  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056848982DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecolecon.2017.04.0322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSesma Mart√≠n, Diego10aFreshwater for Cooling Needs: A Long-Run Approach to the Nuclear Water Footprint in Spain  ap. 146-156.  aFrom the invention of the steam engine to the present, water has represented a significant input to the energy system, although this has been mostly ignored in the literature. In Spain, the most arid country in Europe, studies about water footprint typically just consider domestic, agricultural and industrial water uses, but water requirements for the electricity sector are omitted despite our dependence on thermal power. It has been demonstrated that for each available cooling technology, nuclear needs and consumption of water tend to be larger per MWh generated. We calculate a first approximation to the Spanish nuclear water footprint from 1969 to 2014. Our results show that while water consumed by Spanish nuclear power plants are around 3 m3 per capita/year, water withdrawals per capita/year are around 70 m3. Moreover, our analysis allows extracting conclusions focusing on a River Basins approach. What is the water impact of our nuclear power plants? Will water limit our energy future? These are some of the issues at stake.  aPublisher supplied data 3aelectricity 3aenergy 3afreshwater 3anuclear power 3apower plants 3awater footprint 3awatersheds 3aSpain 0aN540 0aQ49 0aQ25 0aEnergy 0aWater Footprint 0aCooling Technology 0aNuclear 0aSpain1 aRubio-Varas, M¬™. del Mar0 tEcological economics.g2017 Oct., v. 140 p.146-156dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11629x0921-80097nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolecon.2017.04.0323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03831naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003500135040001800170100002500188245013900213300001100352506007600363520202600439592002802465596004502493596003402538596004002572506003702612650001802649650003102667650001702698650001702715650002502732650001402757650002502771650001202796650001902808650001402827650001102841650001402852650002702866650002002893650001602913650001002929700002002939700001902959700002002978700002202998700006203020773010403082856008203186852000903268655001203277IND60660392920221207130912.0200821e201912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066039292DNAL7 a314267772pmid7 aPMC67008162pmcid7 a10.1186/s12896-019-0552-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHaddad Momeni, Majid12aA novel starch-binding laccase from the wheat pathogen Zymoseptoria tritici highlights the functional diversity of ascomycete laccases  ap. 61.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Laccases are multicopper oxidases, which are assigned into auxiliary activity family 1 (AA1) in the CAZy database. These enzymes, catalyzing the oxidation of phenolic and nonphenolic substrates coupled to reduction of O‚ÇÇ to H‚ÇÇO, are increasingly attractive as eco-friendly oxidation biocatalysts. Basidiomycota laccases are well characterized due to their potential in de-lignification of lignocellulose. By contrast, insight into the biochemical diversity of Ascomycota counterparts from saprophytes and plant pathogens is scarce. RESULTS: Here, we report the properties of the laccase from the major wheat pathogen Zymoseptoria tritici (ZtrLac1A), distinguished from common plant fungal pathogens by an apoplastic infection strategy. We demonstrate that ZtrLac1A is appended to a functional starch-binding module and displays an activity signature disfavoring relatively apolar phenolic redox mediators as compared to the related biochemically characterized laccases. By contrast, the redox potential of ZtrLac1A (370‚ÄâmV vs. SHE) is similar to ascomycetes counterparts. The atypical specificity is consistent with distinctive sequence substitutions and insertions in loops flanking the T1 site and the enzyme C-terminus compared to characterized laccases. CONCLUSIONS: ZtrLac1A is the first reported modular laccase appended to a functional starch-specific carbohydrate binding module of family 20 (CBM20). The distinct specificity profile of ZtrLac1A correlates to structural differences in the active site region compared to previously described ascomycetes homologues. These differences are also highlighted by the clustering of the sequence of ZtrLac1A in a distinct clade populated predominantly by plant pathogens in the phylogenetic tree of AA1 laccases. The possible role of these laccases in vivo merits further investigations. These findings expand our toolbox of laccases for green oxidation and highlight the binding functionality of CBM-appended laccases as versatile immobilization tags.  aPublisher supplied data  aNNF12OC0000769cNovo Nordisk Fonden (DK)  a2011_01_0598cCarlsbergfondet  aNNF17OC0025642cNovo Nordisk Fonden0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aBasidiomycota 3aMycosphaerella graminicola 3aactive sites 3abiocatalysts 3acarbohydrate binding 3adatabases 3afunctional diversity 3alaccase 3alignocellulose 3aoxidation 3aoxygen 3aphylogeny 3aplant pathogenic fungi 3aredox potential 3asaprophytes 3awheat1 aBollella, Paolo1 aOrtiz, Roberto1 aThormann, Esben1 aGorton, L.q(Lo),1 aAbou Hachem, Maher1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8250-18420 tBMC biotechnology.g2019 Dec., v. 19, no. 1 p.61-61dBioMed CentralwJournal:19124x1472-67507nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12896-019-0552-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02740naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002100155245015500176500001900331520120300350592002801553650000801581650001801589650002201607650001001629650001001639650001601649650001201665650002601677650002801703650002201731651001001753653001501763653001301778653000901791653002501800700001801825700002201843700002201865700002501887700002201912700001101934700001901945700001901964700002201983773013002005856009002135852000902225655001202234IND60705535720221122031328.0201025e20201202xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070553572DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijfoodmicro.2020.1088062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBalzan, Stefania10aMicrobial metabarcoding highlights different bacterial and fungal populations in honey samples from local beekeepers and market in north-eastern Italy  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aDue to its chemical properties, honey does not foster the growth of microorganisms, however it may contain a rich microbial community, including viable, stressed, and not viable microbes. In order to characterize honey microbiota focusing on the difference between products from beekeepers and large retail in the present study a culture-independent approach based on DNA metabarcoding was applied. Honey samples were collected from Local Beekeepers (LB) and Market sales (M) during four years with the aim to investigate the microbiological quality in the honey market. Extraction and amplification of DNA from honey samples showed reduced efficiency with increasing age of honey, with the loss of 50‚Äì80% of samples four years old (2014). For this reason, only samples of similar age were compared and the analysis of microbial communities focused on year 2017, for a total of 75 samples. Differences in alpha and beta-diversity were evidenced comparing microbial communities between LB and M samples. In particular, contaminant bacteria dominated the microbiota in M samples while LB samples were enriched in Lactic Acid Bacteria (LAB) that cannot be isolated with culture-dependent approaches.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aDNA barcoding 3afood microbiology 3afungi 3ahoney 3alactic acid 3amarkets 3amicrobial communities 3amicrobiological quality 3aspecies diversity 3aItaly 0aMicrobiota 0arRNA 16S 0aITS2 0aLactic acid bacteria1 aCarraro, Lisa1 aMerlanti, Roberta1 aLucatello, Lorena1 aCapolongo, Francesca1 aFontana, Federico1 aYambo,1 aLarini, Ilaria1 aVitulo, Nicola1 aCardazzo, Barbara0 tInternational journal of food microbiology.g2020 Dec. 02, v. 334 p.108806-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl35565x0168-16057nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijfoodmicro.2020.1088063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02742naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245013600170300001600306520154200322592002801864650002201892650002801914650001801942650002501960650001801985650003002003653005002033653001902083653001902102653002502121700002302146700002902169773008902198856008402287852000902371655001202380IND60603648020221120225230.0180716e20150615xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060364802DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2015.04.0412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFrancioso, Luca10aExperimental assessment of thermoelectric generator package properties: Simulated results validation and real gradient capabilities  ap. 300-310.  aThe optimized design of a flexible micro thermoelectric generator (TEG) suitable for self-powered wearable devices and its real temperature gradient performance is proposed and discussed in this paper.

The experimental results confirmed that the experimentally measured thermal gradient ranges between 0.20 and 0.64¬†K higher than the simulated value and such a result has great importance for correct generator design and determination of effective thermal gradient which can be recovered using the proposed package solution. Heat transfer analysis was performed to optimize the proposed package solution and maximize the thermal gradient that can be recovered between the thermocouples junctions. Experimental results confirmed that the thicker package ensures better insulation, with a real gradient about 0.11¬†K lower that the simulated one. The warm-up time for 4¬†mm package to completely thermalize the Kapton upper surface is about 500¬†s; good matching on thermal response times has been found between the experimental and simulated results for all investigated package thicknesses.  aPublisher supplied data 3acomputer software 3afinite element analysis 3aheat transfer 3ainsulating materials 3athermocouples 3athermoelectric generators 0aThermoelectric generator package performances 0aFEA simulation 0aThermal camera 0aTemperature gradient1 aDe Pascali, Chiara1 aSiciliano, P.q(Pietro),0 tEnergy.g2015 June 15, v. 86 p.300-310dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2015.04.0413Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03214naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100003200155245019400187500001900381520157000400592002801970650002101998650001202019650001202031650001402043650002202057650001702079650002202096650002502118650002502143650001602168650001902184650001302203650001702216653001702233653002402250653002402274653001802298700002702316700002102343700002202364700002602386700002102412700005802433773013002491856009002621852000902711655001202720IND60705535820221122031315.0201025e20201202xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070553582DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijfoodmicro.2020.1088072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGarc√≠a-Pastor, Mar√≠a Emma10aPreharvest application of methyl salicylate, acetyl salicylic acid and salicylic acid alleviated disease caused by Botrytis cinerea through stimulation of antioxidant system in table grapes  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe main goal of this study was to describe impact of preharvest application of methyl salicylate (MeSA), acetyl salicylic acid (ASA) and salicylic acid (SA) on the reduction of disease caused by Botrytis cinerea in two table grape cultivars (‚ÄòCrimson‚Äô and ‚ÄòMagenta‚Äô). Based on previous studies, MeSA and SA were applied at 0.1 and 0.01‚ÄØmM for both cultivars, while ASA was applied at 1‚ÄØmM in ‚ÄòCrimson‚Äô and 0.1‚ÄØmM in ‚ÄòMagenta‚Äô. At time of harvest, berry maturity-quality attributes, bioactive compounds and antioxidant enzymes were determined. In addition, grapes were artificially inoculated with B. cinerea spores, and the berries were ranked for visual decay incidence after 5‚ÄØdays of inoculation. Salicylates preharvest treatments led to higher total acidity, content of bioactive compounds and activity of antioxidant enzymes in treated than in control berries. The application of salicylate derivatives induced resistance to B. cinerea spoilage, since higher percentage of berries with no symptoms was observed and on the contrary, the highest percentages of berries were obtained in control grapes. All preharvest treatments with SA, ASA and MeSA alleviated postharvest disease caused by B. cinerea probably due to increasing levels of phenolic compounds and activity of antioxidant enzymes, although the best results were obtained with MeSA at 0.1‚ÄØmM. Also, for this treatment and dose, higher quality properties, such as higher concentrations of ascorbic, succinic and fumaric acids, were observed compared with no treated-grapes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBotrytis cinerea 3aacidity 3aaspirin 3acultivars 3afood microbiology 3aharvest date 3amethyl salicylate 3apostharvest diseases 3apreharvest treatment 3asalicylates 3asalicylic acid 3aspoilage 3atable grapes 0aFungal decay 0aAntioxidant enzymes 0aBioactive compounds 0aOrganic acids1 aGim√©nez, Mar√≠a Jos√©1 aZapata, Pedro J.1 aGuill√©n, Fabi√°n1 aValverde, Juan Miguel1 aSerrano, Mar√≠a,1 aValero, Daniel1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3945-16290 tInternational journal of food microbiology.g2020 Dec. 02, v. 334 p.108807-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl35565x0168-16057nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijfoodmicro.2020.1088073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03910naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130100001700148245013400165300001600299500001500315520232200330592002802652650001702680650001902697650001402716650002202730650002302752650001102775650001802786650002602804650002302830650002502853650001402878650002102892650003802913650001502951650002102966650001802987650001903005650001103024653002203035700002203057700003303079700002503112700002403137700001803161773012003179856008403299852000903383655001203392IND4465006120221120074341.0141111e20120630xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446500612DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vetimm.2012.04.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJanda, Jozef10aGeneration of equine TSLP-specific antibodies and their use for detection of TSLP produced by equine keratinocytes and leukocytes  ap. 180-186.  a2019-12-06  aAllergic horses react to innocuous environmental substances by activation of Th2 cells and production of allergen-specific IgE antibodies. The mechanisms leading to Th2 differentiation are not well understood. In humans and mice, epithelial cell-derived thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) plays a central role in this process. Little is known about equine TSLP (eqTSLP) and its role in allergic diseases and our current knowledge is limited to the assessment of TSLP mRNA expression. In order to be able to study eqTSLP at the protein level, the aim of the present study was to produce recombinant eqTSLP protein and generate TSLP-specific antibodies. EqTSLP was cloned from a skin biopsy sample from a horse with chronic urticaria and eqTSLP protein was expressed in E.coli and in mammalian cells. Recombinant proteins were designed to include C-terminal Histag, which allowed subsequent purification and detection by Histag-specific Ab. Polyclonal and monoclonal eqTSLP-specific Ab were generated after immunization of mice with E.coli-expressed TSLP. Their specificity was tested by western blotting and ELISA. In addition, a commercially available polyclonal human TSLP-specific antibody was tested for cross-reactivity with eqTSLP. Expression of TSLP protein was confirmed by western blotting using Histag-specific Ab. E.coli-expressed TSLP appears as a band of ‚àº13kDa, whereas mammalian cell-expressed TSLP showed several bands at 20‚Äì25kDa, probably representing several glycosylation forms. Polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies generated in this study, as well as commercially available human TSLP-specific Ab reacted with both E.coli- and mammalian cell-expressed TSLP in western blotting and ELISA. A capture ELISA was established to quantitate TSLP in cell supernatants and validated using supernatants from primary equine keratinocytes and peripheral blood leukocytes (PBL). Increased TSLP concentrations were found after stimulation of keratinocytes with PMA+ionomycine and with Culicoides extract. Similarly, increased TSLP concentrations were detected in PBL after stimulation with ConA, Culicoides extract, or IgE cross-linking. In conclusion, recombinant TSLP proteins and TSLP-specific antibodies produced in this study will allow further studies of the role of TSLP in equine allergic diseases.  aPublisher supplied data 3acrosslinking 3across reaction 3aurticaria 3aantigen detection 3aantibody formation 3ahumans 3aglycosylation 3apolyclonal antibodies 3aantibody detection 3arecombinant proteins 3acytokines 3aWestern blotting 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3aleukocytes 3aimmunoglobulin E 3akeratinocytes 3ahorse diseases 3ahorses 0aprotein synthesis1 aPlattet, Philippe1 aTorsteinsdottir, Sigurbj√∂rg1 aJonsdottir, Sigridur1 aZurbriggen, Andreas1 aMarti, Eliane0 tVeterinary immunology and immunopathology.g2012 June 30, v. 147, no. 3-4 p.180-186dElsevier B.V.x0165-24277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetimm.2012.04.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03832naa a2200637 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004300111040001800154100003500172245012800207300001600335520178100351592002802132650002702160650001002187650001302197650001202210650001302222650001702235650002602252650002202278650002002300650000702320650003402327650002302361650001502384650001502399650002002414650002002434650001602454650002002470650001802490650005002508650002702558650003202585650002602617650001602643650001802659650005402677650003302731650004802764650003402812650002002846650001602866650001002882700002602892700002402918700002902942773011302971856008903084852000903173655001203182IND4451695320221122103311.0141111e20110301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445169532DNAL7 a210930852pmid7 a10.1016/j.ijfoodmicro.2010.10.0202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBelessi, Charalambia-Eirini A.10aEfficiency of different sanitation methods on Listeria monocytogenes biofilms formed under various environmental conditions  ap. S46-S52.  aThe resistance of Listeria monocytogenes biofilms formed under food processing conditions, against various sanitizing agents and disinfection procedures was evaluated in the present study. The first sanitation procedure included biofilm formation on stainless steel coupons (SS) placed in tryptic soy broth supplemented with 0.6% yeast extract (TSBYE) of various concentrations of NaCl (0.5, 7.5 and 9.5%) at different temperatures (5 and 20¬∞C). The biofilms formed were exposed to warm (60¬∞C) water for 20min, or to peroxyacetic acid (2% PAA) for 1, 2, 3 and 6min. Treatment with warm water caused no significant (P‚â•0.05) reductions in the attached populations. Conversely, surviving bacteria on SS coupons decreased as the exposure time to 2% PAA increased and could not be detected by culture after 6min of exposure. Biofilms formed at 20¬∞C were more resistant to PAA than biofilms formed at 5¬∞C. Salt concentration in the growth medium had no marked impact on the resistance to PAA. The second sanitation procedure included biofilm formation of nonadapted (NA) and acid-adapted (AA) cells in TSBYE of pH 5.0 and 7.0 (i.e., NA-5.0, NA-7.0 and AA-5.0, AA-7.0) at 4¬∞C. Coupons bearing attached cells of L. monocytogenes were periodically exposed to chlorine (0.465% Cl‚Åª), quaternary ammonium compound (1% QAC) and 2% PAA. The resistance of attached cells to QAC, PAA and Cl‚Åª followed the order: AA-5.0>NA-7.0‚â•AA-7.0>NA-5.0. The most effective sanitizer was QAC followed by PAA and Cl‚Åª. The results can lead to the development of efficient sanitation strategies in order to eliminate L. monocytogenes from the processing environment. Furthermore, such results may explain the presence of L. monocytogenes after sanitation as a result of cell attachment history.  aPublisher supplied data 3aListeria monocytogenes 3aacids 3abacteria 3abiofilm 3achlorine 3adisinfection 3aenvironmental factors 3aexposure duration 3afood processing 3apH 3aquaternary ammonium compounds 3asalt concentration 3asanitation 3asanitizers 3asodium chloride 3astainless steel 3atemperature 3awater treatment 3ayeast extract 2aBiofilmsxdrug effectsxgrowth & development. 2aChlorinexpharmacology 2aDisinfectantsxpharmacology 2aDisinfectionxmethods 2aEnvironment 2aFood Handling 2aListeria monocytogenesxdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aPeracetic Acidxpharmacology 2aQuaternary Ammonium Compoundsxpharmacology 2aSodium Chloridexpharmacology 2aStainless Steel 2aTemperature 2aWater1 aGounadaki, Antonia S.1 aPsomas, Antonios N.1 aSkandamis, Panagiotis N.0 tInternational journal of food microbiology.g2011 Mar. 1, v. 145S1 p.S46-S52dElsevier B.V.x0168-16057nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijfoodmicro.2010.10.0203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03461naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100005600152245012000208300001500328520192500343592002802268650001302296650000802309650001802317650000902335650001302344650002102357650001402378650001702392650001502409650002202424650000902446650002202455650001102477650001902488650001902507650001502526651001002541653002902551653001702580653003402597700005402631700001902685700001902704700001802723700001802741773008902759856008602848852000902934655001202943IND60531388420221117155801.0160723e20161115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053138842DNAL7 a10.1016/j.atmosres.2016.06.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHu, Qingqing1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9386-648114aThe variation of characteristics of individual particles during the haze evolution in the urban Shanghai atmosphere  ap. 95-105.  aThe severe long-lasting haze episode in December 2013 provided a unique opportunity to track the variation of aerosol particles in Shanghai, China. Concentrations and sources of the pollutants varied greatly in severe haze-fog episode (P1), moderate haze episode (P2), and clear episode (P3). Both low wind speed and high relative humidity (RH) during P1 resulted in the high level pollutants of PM2.5 (240.3¬±167.9Œºgm‚àí3), SO2 (37.9¬±20.7Œºgm‚àí3), NO2 (111.5¬±50.2Œºgm‚àí3) and total water-soluble ions (58.73¬±28.87Œºgm‚àí3), indicating a strong accumulation of local pollutants and secondary species formation. During P2, air masses from the north decreased the concentration level of particles (116.1¬±65.5Œºgm‚àí3) and increased the visibility, resulting in a moderate degree of pollution. Most of the pollutants dropped to the lowest concentration levels due to the rainfall in P3, and the haze episode ended at 13 December. Single particle analysis showed that C-rich particles exhibited the highest number percentages (30%) in the samples of P1, S/N-rich species (35%) dominated the particles in the samples of P2, and Al/Si-rich particles (23%) were most abundant in the samples of P3. The TEM-EDS analysis confirmed that particles contained more internally mixed components during P1 and P2 than those during P3, suggesting that the particles during P1 and P2 underwent more intense aging in the atmosphere. The single particle analysis indicated that trace metals may promote the heterogeneous transformation of SO2 and NO2 on the surface of the particles during P1, which was in agreement with the highest sulfur oxidation ratio (SOR) and nitrogen oxidation ratio (NOR) observed in the haze-fog episode. Such information will deepen our understanding on the evolution of haze and fog pollutions in China, which will help the government to establish efficient control strategy for air pollution prevention.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaerosols 3aair 3aair pollution 3aions 3anitrogen 3anitrogen dioxide 3aoxidation 3aparticulates 3apollutants 3apollution control 3arain 3arelative humidity 3asulfur 3asulfur dioxide 3atrace elements 3awind speed 3aChina 0aSingle-particle analysis 0aFog and haze 0aThe Shanghai urban atmosphere1 aFu, Hongbo1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5542-96541 aWang, Zhenzhen1 aKong, Lingdong1 aChen, Mindong1 aChen, Jianmin0 tAtmospheric research.g2016 Nov. 15, v. 181 p.95-105dElsevier B.V.x0169-80957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.atmosres.2016.06.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03245naa a2200841 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001100147245015500158520107600313592002801389650001601417650001801433650001801451650002101469650001701490650001401507650000901521650002701530650001701557650003001574650001201604650002001616650000901636650001401645650001201659650002201671650001301693650002001706653001901726653002501745653001701770653001701787653004001804653000901844653000901853653000801862653000701870653000801877653000901885653000801894653000801902653000801910653000701918653000901925653000901934653000801943653001001951653001001961653000801971653000901979653000801988653001001996653000802006653000802014653000802022653000902030653001002039653000902049653000702058700001402065700001602079700002002095700005502115700001802170773011202188856008202300852000902382655001202391IND60675714220221120120359.0200210e202001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067571422DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jff.2019.1036612doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYanyi,10aShort-chain fructo-oligosaccharides alleviates oxidized oil-induced intestinal dysfunction in piglets associated with the modulation of gut microbiota  aIn this study, the protective effects of short-chain fructo-oligosaccharides (scFOS) on oxidized oil feeding-induced intestinal dysfunction were evaluated. Piglets were fed either a control diet, an oxidized oil diet, or an oxidized oil diet supplemented with scFOS (4‚ÄØg/kg diet) for 28‚ÄØdays. The results showed that scFOS increased the expression of tight junction proteins and decreased the production of malondialdehyde and pro-inflammatory cytokines in jejunum of oxidized oil-challenged piglets. In addition, scFOS mitigated oxidized oil-dependent changes in the relative abundances of Prevotella_9, Bacteroides, Campylobacter, and Lactobacillus back to normal status as well as restored the colonic butyric acid production of oxidized oil-treated piglets. Hence, scFOS consumption alleviated oxidized oil-induced intestinal barrier injury, redox imbalance, and inflammation associated with the alterations of microbiota composition, suggesting that scFOS could be used to prevent intestinal dysfunction caused by oxidized oil in both human and animal nutrition.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacteroides 3aCampylobacter 3aLactobacillus 3aanimal nutrition 3abutyric acid 3acytokines 3adiet 3afructooligosaccharides 3ainflammation 3aintestinal microorganisms 3ajejunum 3amalondialdehyde 3aoils 3aoxidation 3apiglets 3aprotective effect 3aproteins 3atight junctions 0aGut microbiota 0aIntestinal integrity 0aOxidized oil 0aRedox status 0aShort-chain fructo-oligosaccharides 0aACTB 0aADFI 0aADG 0aBW 0aCAT 0aCLDN 0aDAO 0aFD4 0aGPX 0aHO 0aIRAK 0aKEAP 0aMDA 0aMyD88 0aNFŒ∫B 0aNRF 0aOCLN 0aOTU 0ascFOS 0aSOD 0aTBP 0aTER 0aTLR4 0aTOP2B 0aTRAF 0aZO1 aZhou, Pan1 aZhang, Yong1 aZhang, Zhenzhen1 aLiu, Jingbo1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2597-69021 aZhang, Hongfu0 tJournal of functional foods.g2020 Jan., v. 64 p.103661-dElsevier LtdwJournal:J000000142x1756-46467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jff.2019.1036613Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02746naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002100140245015400161520151500315592002801830650002401858650001901882650002001901650002801921650002101949650001501970650001101985650002601996650002402022700001902046700002302065700002202088700003202110700002302142773012302165856007502288852000902363655001202372IND60757865520221118013022.0211125e20211115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075786552DNAL7 a10.3390/nu131140842doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPorykali, Bobby 10aEffects of Nutritional Interventions on Cardiovascular Disease Health Outcomes in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians: A Scoping Review  aNutrition interventions can support Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples to reduce their risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD). This review examines nutritional interventions aiming to improve CVD outcomes and appraises peer-reviewed interventions using an Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Quality Appraisal Tool. Five electronic databases and grey literature were searched, applying no time limit. Two reviewers completed the screening, data extraction and quality assessment independently. The study quality was assessed using the South Australian Health and Medical Research Institute and the Centre of Research Excellence in Aboriginal Chronic Disease Knowledge Translation and Exchange Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Quality Appraisal Tool (QAT). Twenty-one nutrition programs were included in this review. Twelve reported on anthropometric measurements, ten on biochemical and/or hematological measurements and sixteen on other outcome domains. Most programs reported improvements in measurable CVD risk factors, including reduced body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC), weight, blood pressure and improved lipid profiles. Most programs performed well at community engagement and capacity strengthening, but many lacked the inclusion of Indigenous research paradigms, governance and strengths-based approaches. This review highlights the need for contemporary nutrition programs aimed at improving cardiovascular health outcomes to include additional key cultural components.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiomedical research 3ablood pressure 3abody mass index 3acardiovascular diseases 3achronic diseases 3agovernance 3alipids 3aresearch institutions 3awaist circumference1 aDavies, Alyse 1 aBrooks, Cassandra 1 aMelville, Hannah 1 aAllman-Farinelli, Margaret 1 aCoombes, Julieann 0 tNutrients.g2021 Nov. 15, v. 13, no. 11dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2271x2072-66437nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu131140843Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01492naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001600140245011200156300001800268520034900286592002800635650001600663650002300679650002300702650001900725650002100744650001600765700001600781700001500797700001500812700001200827700003000839700001600869700001700885773013300902856007401035852000901109655001201118IND60698229420221118010214.0200610e20200609xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069822942DNAL7 a10.1039/d0cc01936d2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFan, Yunfei10aWettability read-out strategy for aptamer target binding based on a recognition/hydrophobic bilayer surface  ap. 6225-6228.  aWe established a wettability read-out strategy for an aptasensor with a bilayer surface, using hydrophobicity reduction as the signal.

Though these counterfeit and non-compliance of drugs can induce adverse effects during their utilization, there is no monitoring system of veterinary medicines. The present pilot study was carried out in Cameroon to identify and describe suspected cases of adverse reactions to veterinary drugs in animals and / or humans as well as inefficacy of veterinary drugs. The methodology involved a descriptive cross-sectional survey of 67 actors in the veterinary medicine sector in Cameroon. RESULTS: A total of 74/120 (62%) cases of suspected adverse effects and or lack of efficacy of veterinary drugs in animals and 46 (38%) cases of adverse reactions in humans were identified. Antiparasitics were the most incriminated therapeutic class in animals (61%) and human (56%). Adverse reactions were reported in dogs (44%) and poultry (24%) while drug inefficacy was most observed in poultry (47%). According to animal health professionals, levamisole (24%) and ivermectin (16%) were identified to be responsible for the adverse effects and that the highest level of inefficacy was most frequently reported for oxytetracycline (29%). The main adverse reactions were systemic (22%), gastrointestinal (20%) and neurological (13%) disorders. CONCLUSION: The results of this study showed that misuse and circulation of poor quality as well as lack of efficacy of veterinary drugs is very common in Cameroon. Adverse reactions were observed in animals and humans. Therefore, the establishment of a national veterinary pharmacovigilance system based on solid legal bases is essential for a continuous assessment of the risks-benefits effects of veterinary drugs marketed in Cameroon.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aadverse effects 3aanimal health 3across-sectional studies 3adogs 3agastrointestinal system 3ahealth care workers 3ahumans 3aivermectin 3alevamisole 3amarkets 3amonitoring 3aoxytetracycline 3apoultry 3atherapeutics 3aveterinary drugs 3aCameroon1 aNjingou, Badou Zaki Ndouoya1 aMoffo, Fr√©d√©ric1 aMpouam, Serge Eugene1 aFeussom, Jean Marc Kameni1 aAwah-Ndukum, Julius0 tBMC veterinary research.g2019 Dec., v. 15, no. 1 p.301-301dBioMed CentralwJournal:jnl4152735x1746-61487nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12917-019-2043-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04124naa a2200673 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002200094024001900116024003500135040001800170100002800188245008300216300001200299506007600311520201900387592002802406506003702434650002502471650001402496650001802510650001502528650002502543650002402568650001702592650000902609650001002618650001502628650002102643650002102664650002002685650001702705650001002722650002302732650002602755650001502781650001402796650001602810650001902826650002602845700002202871700002302893700002402916700002902940700002702969700002002996700002903016700003003045700002503075700002303100700002003123700002703143700006003170773011703230856008203347852000903429655001203438IND60660393620221207133950.0210403e201912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066039362DNAL7 aPMC67008142pmcid7 a314297522pmid7 a10.1186/s12917-019-2050-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMravƒç√°kov√°, Dominika10aNatural chemotherapeutic alternatives for controlling of haemonchosis in sheep  ap. 302.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Parallel in vitro and in vivo experiments were designed to evaluate promising chemotherapeutic alternatives for controlling haemonchosis in ruminants. In vitro anthelmintic activities (egg hatch test ‚Äì EHT; larval development test ‚Äì LDT) of aqueous and methanolic herbal extracts Mix1 and Mix2 were investigated. The in vivo effects of dietary supplementation with Mix1 and Mix2 on the parasitological status, inflammatory response, antioxidant parameters and microbial community of the lambs infected experimentally with Haemonchus contortus were investigated. Lambs were divided into four groups for the in vivo study: uninfected control lambs (C), infected lambs (I), infected lambs supplemented with Mix1 (I‚Äâ+‚ÄâMix1) and infected lambs supplemented with Mix2 (I‚Äâ+‚ÄâMix2). The experimental period was 70‚Äâdays. RESULTS: The number of eggs per gram (EPG) of feces was quantified 22, 30, 37, 44, 51, 58, 65 and 70‚Äâdays post-infection, and mean abomasal worm counts were assessed 70‚Äâdays post-infection. Quantitative analyses identified 57.3 and 22.2‚Äâmg/g phenolic acids, 41.5 and 29.5‚Äâmg/g flavonoids and 1.4 and 1.33‚Äâmg/g protoberberine-type alkaloids in Mix1 and Mix2, respectively. The methanolic extracts of the herbal mixtures in both in vitro tests had higher anthelmintic effects (P‚Äâ<¬†0.01) than the aqueous extracts, but the effects did not differ significantly between Mix1 and Mix2 (P‚Äâ>¬†0.05). I‚Äâ+‚ÄâMix1 and I‚Äâ+‚ÄâMix2 lowered mean EPGs between 44 and 70 d by 58.1 and 51.6%, respectively. The level of IgG antibodies against H. contortus increased significantly after infection in each infected group. CONCLUSION: These results represent the first monitoring of the in vitro anthelmintic effects of herbal mixtures on H. contortus. The in vivo experiment indicated that the anthelmintic effect was not sufficient for the elimination of parasites, but this herbal treatment may affect the host over a longer term, reducing the parasitic infection in the host.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aHaemonchus contortus 3aalkaloids 3aanthelmintics 3aantibodies 3aantioxidant activity 3adietary supplements 3adrug therapy 3aeggs 3afeces 3aflavonoids 3aimmunoglobulin G 3ain vitro studies 3ain vivo studies 3ainflammation 3alambs 3alarval development 3amicrobial communities 3amonitoring 3aparasites 3aparasitoses 3aphenolic acids 3aquantitative analysis1 aV√°radyov√°, Zora1 aKopƒç√°kov√°, Anna1 aƒåobanov√°, Klaudia1 aGre≈°√°kov√°, ƒΩubom√≠ra1 aKi≈°idayov√°, Svetlana1 aBabj√°k, Michal1 aDolinsk√°, Michaela Urda1 aDvoro≈æ≈à√°kov√°, Em√≠lia1 aK√∂nigov√°, Al≈æbeta1 aVadlejch, Jaroslav1 aCie≈õlak, Adam,1 a≈ölusarczyk, Sylwester1 aV√°rady, Mari√°n1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6589-82190 tBMC veterinary research.g2019 Dec., v. 15, no. 1 p.302-302dBioMed CentralwJournal:jnl4152735x1746-61487nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12917-019-2050-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02827naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002500151245015200176300001400328500001900342520140600361592002801767650001801795650001801813650001101831650001601842650001101858650001901869650001801888650001501906650001901921650001801940653001601958653002801974653002602002653002302028653002702051653003002078700001602108700005202124773011002176856008602286852000902372655001202381IND60705536320221122031349.0201104e20201110xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070553632DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jbiotec.2020.07.0202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGabbott, Christopher10aCell marbles: A novel cell encapsulation technology by wrapping cell suspension droplets using electrospun nanofibers for developmental engineering  ap. 82-91.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aDevelopmental Engineering aims to imitate natural tissue regeneration processes via an additive manufacturing approach. This research developes a technology to fabricate ready-made cell marbles (CMs) by wrapping cell suspension droplets of (3‚àí15 Œºl) with electrospun hydrophobic nanofibers, as modular building blocks for developmental engineering. Human dermal fibroblasts and/or immortalised keratinocytes were suspended in the culture media cores of the CMs. The encapsulated cells were observed to precipitate at bottoms or up-inclined inner surfaces of the fibrous shells within 10 min. The CMs were mechanically strong enough to be handled as soft solids, thus easily and accurately delivered using forceps into three distinct culture systems, including tissue culture plastics, cellulosic scaffolds and in vitro fibrin wound models. The release of the cells, culture media and nanofibers into specific delivery points within the investigated culture systems was achieved via the controlled rupture of the CMs triggered by the simple hydrophobic-hydrophilic interaction between the nanofibers and the aqueous surroundings. Further cell and tissue culture studies indicated that the prominent traits of the skin cells were well preserved during cell encapsulation and delivery processes, suggesting the great potential of the CMs for additive tissue manufacturing in developmental engineering.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiotechnology 3aencapsulation 3afibrin 3afibroblasts 3ahumans 3ahydrophobicity 3akeratinocytes 3ananofibers 3atissue culture 3atissue repair 0aCell marble 0aCell suspension droplet 0aElectrospun nanofiber 0aCell encapsulation 0aModular building block 0aDevelopmental engineering1 aMele, Elisa1 aSun, Tao1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1715-75760 tJournal of biotechnology.g2020 Nov. 10, v. 323 p.82-91dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl46789x0168-16567nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jbiotec.2020.07.0203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03669naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245012100169520223300290592002802523650001302551650001402564650002802578650001502606650001102621650001802632650000902650650002302659650001402682650001102696650002502707650001402732650002202746650001502768651001202783653002002795653003802815653003902853653001402892653002302906653001702929700002502946700001602971773010502987856008603092852000903178655001203187IND60771583220221120082100.0220531e202206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077158322DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhydrol.2022.1277532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJukiƒá, Damir10aTemporal and spatial characterization of sediment transport through a karst aquifer by means of time series analysis  aThe process of sediment transport through a karst aquifer is investigated by means of time series analysis. The correlation and spectral analyses are used for determination of the temporal characteristics of this process, such as timing, synchronization with discharge from spring, and time delay between arrivals of sediment and infiltrated rainwater to spring. The partial correlation analysis is used for the spatial characterization. The study area is the catchment of Jadro Spring in Croatia. The analyzed hourly time series are discharge, water temperature, electrical conductivity, and nephelometric turbidity recorded at the source of this spring, as well as the rainfall collected at three locations in the catchment of spring. They cover the period of four years, from 2017 to 2020. The main aims of this research are (1) presentation of the methods of time series analysis that can be used for the investigation of sediment transport through karst aquifer, (2) analysis of the applicability of partial cross-correlation functions for the spatial characterization of sediment transport process, and (3) extension of the existing knowledge about the sediment in water from karst springs with a special reference to the Jadro Spring. The obtained results show that the partial cross-correlation function can be very useful in the investigation of mass transport through the karst aquifer. They enable identification of the specific contribution of each rain-gauge location to the quantity and quality of spring water. Specifically, the origin of sediment in water from Jadro Spring is determined in this study, as well as the origin of quick-flow and baseflow component in discharge from this spring, including the timing of fresh rainwater arrival, rainwater withdrawal, and emptying of previously accumulated water in vadose and phreatic zone. The sediment transport through the karst aquifer of Jadro Spring is initiated after heavy rainfall in the central and eastern part of the catchment. The origin of sediment in spring water is dominantly the remobilized autochthonous sediment from aquifer, and possible limited contribution of allochthonous sediment from the part of catchment located in hinterland of spring.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaquifers 3abase flow 3aelectrical conductivity 3ahinterland 3akarsts 3amass transfer 3arain 3asediment transport 3asediments 3aspring 3atime series analysis 3aturbidity 3awater temperature 3awatersheds 3aCroatia 0aKarst hydrology 0aCorrelation and spectral analysis 0aPartial cross-correlation function 0aTurbidity 0aSediment transport 0aJadro Spring1 aDeniƒá-Jukiƒá, Vesna1 aKadiƒá, Ana0 tJournal of hydrology.g2022 June, v. 609 p.127753-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl46539x0022-16947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2022.1277533Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03027naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100002100112245010000133300001800233520174900251592002802000650001902028650002002047650001702067650002202084650001602106650001302122650001202135650001502147650005202162650001202214650001802226650001102244650001602255651001502271653001702286653002002303653001802323653001702341653001902358700002202377700001502399700002302414773012302437852000902560655001202569IND60128896320221119185354.0151124e201211  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012889632DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLothrop, Hugh D.10aUse of Scented Sugar Bait Stations to Track Mosquito-Borne Arbovirus Transmission in California  ap. 1466-1472.  aLaboratory and field research was conducted to determine if Culex tarsalis Coquillett expectorated West Nile virus (WNV) during sugar feeding and if a lure or bait station could be developed to exploit this behavior for WNV surveillance. Experimentally infected Cx. tarsalis repeatedly expectorated WNV onto filter paper strips and into vials with wicks containing sucrose that was readily detectable by a quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction assay. Few females (33%, n = 27) became infected by imbibing sugar solutions spiked with high concentrations (10‚Å∑ plaque forming units/ml) of WNV, indicating sugar feeding stations probably would not be a source of WNV infection. In nature, sugar bait stations scented with the floral attractant phenyl acetaldehyde tracked WNV transmission activity in desert but not urban or agricultural landscapes in California. When deployed in areas of the Coachella Valley with WNV activity during the summer of 2011, 27 of 400 weekly sugar samples (6.8%) tested positive for WNV RN A by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. Prevalence of positives varied spatially, but positive sugar stations were detected before concurrent surveillance measures of infection (mosquito pools) or transmission (sentinel chicken seroconversions). In contrast, sugar bait stations deployed in urban settings in Los Angeles or agricultural habits near Bakersfield in Kern County supporting WNV activity produced 1 of 90 and 0 of 60 positive weekly sugar samples, respectively. These results with sugar bait stations will require additional research to enhance bait attractancy and to understand the relationship between positive sugar stations and standard metrics of arbovirus surveillance.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCulex tarsalis 3aWest Nile virus 3aacetaldehyde 3aagricultural land 3aarboviruses 3achickens 3afemales 3amonitoring 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3asucrose 3asugar feeding 3asummer 3aurban areas 3aCalifornia 0asurveillance 0aWest Nile virus 0asugar feeding 0abait station 0aCulex larsalis1 aWheeler, Sarah S.1 aFang, Ying1 aReisen, William K.0 tJournal of medical entomology.g2012 Nov., v. 49, no. 6 p.1466-1472dEntomological Society of Americax0022-25857nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle04226naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002100148245013500169300001200304520252000316592002802836650001302864650002802877650001502905650001602920650001702936650001002953650001502963650001302978650001402991650001103005650002803016650001403044650001703058650002003075650001103095650002403106700002503130700001903155700002003174700002203194700002203216700002003238700002303258700002203281700002103303700001903324700001903343700002803362700002103390700002803411773011703439856008303556852000903639655001203648IND60793547520221116145135.0221005e202212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079354752DNAL7 a10.1186/s12917-022-03444-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSharawy, Heba A.14aThe vaginal and uterine blood flow changes during the ovsynch program and its impact on the pregnancy rates in Holstein dairy cows  ap. 350.  aAIM : OvSynch is a hormonal protocol for synchronization of estrus and use of artificial insemination (AI) at an optimal time without adverse effects on the ovaries or uterus. This study investigated the use of noninvasive color Doppler ultrasound to assess changes in uterine and vaginal blood flow during the Ovsynch program for synchronization of estrus and its relation to the pregnancy rates in Holstein cows. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The experimental cows received an intramuscular dose of 10 Œºg of a GnRH analogue (G1), followed 7 days later with an intramuscular injection of synthetic prostaglandin F2Œ± (P: PGF2Œ±) analogue (500 Œºg cloprostenol sodium), and given a 10 Œºg, injection of the GnRH analogue (G2) i.m. 48 h after the PGF2Œ± treatment, and the cows were bred 14-16 h after. Uterine and vaginal perfusion were investigated by performing transrectal Doppler ultrasonography of both the uterine and vaginal arteries in Holstein cows at different time points during the Ovsynch program to determine: peak systolic velocity (PSV), time-averaged maximum velocity (TAMV), the volume of blood flow (BFV), pulsatility index (PI), resistance index (RI), resistance impedance (S/D) and diameters of uterine (UA) and vaginal (VA) arteries. Steroid hormones were also assayed. Transrectal ultrasonography (TUS) was performed at 32 and 60 days to confirm the pregnancy per artificial insemination (P/AI). RESULTS: The uterine PSV, TAMV, and PV were greater at the time of the cloprostenol sodium and second GnRH injections (p<0.05) than at the time of the first GnRH injection. The vaginal PSV, PV were greater at the time of the cloprostenol sodium than at the time of the first and second GnRH injections (p<0.05). The receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC curve) indicated a high correlation between the uterine and vaginal blood flow and the rate of the pregnancy (p<0.05). The area under the ROC curve was 0.920 and 0.87 (p<0.05) for vaginal and uterine arteries respectively at time of G2. The serum levels of progesterone, estrogen and cortisol were correlated with the P/AI (p<0.05). The P/AI significantly decreased from 43.9 % at 32 d to 35.37 % at 60 d. CONCLUSION: These results indicate that noninvasive Doppler ultrasonography is a valid method to evaluate changes in the characteristics of uterine and vaginal blood flow in cows during the Ovsynch protocol. Furthermore, vaginal and uterine blood flow are two determinant factors for the higher conception rates in Holstein dairy cows.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHolstein 3aartificial insemination 3ablood flow 3ablood serum 3acloprostenol 3acolor 3aconception 3acortisol 3aestrogens 3aestrus 3aintramuscular injection 3apregnancy 3aprogesterone 3aultrasonography 3auterus 3aveterinary medicine1 aHegab, AbdelRaouf O.1 aRisha, Engy F.1 aEl-Adl, Mohamed1 aSoliman, Walid T.1 aGohar, Mohamed A.1 aFahmy, Reham A.1 aFarag, Virginia M.1 aImakawa, Kazuhiko1 aBazer, Fuller W.1 aJames, Daniela1 aZaghloul, Adel1 aAbdalla, Abdelnasser A.1 aRabie, Mariam M.1 aElmetwally, Mohammed A.0 tBMC veterinary research.g2022 Dec., v. 18, no. 1 p.350-350dBioMed CentralwJournal:jnl4152735x1746-61487nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12917-022-03444-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03407naa a2200637 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004300111040001800154100001800172245009800190300001600288520147900304592002801783650002001811650001901831650001501850650001301865650001201878650001701890650001201907650001101919650001501930650000901945650001401954650001001968650001101978650000901989650001301998650001202011650002802023650003802051650002902089650003402118650001102152650002502163650004702188650002002235650004902255650005402304650008902358651001402447700001702461700001802478700001302496700001602509700001702525700001402542700001902556773008402575856008902659852000902748655001202757IND4466493520221120224759.0141110e201203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446649352DNAL7 a221543392pmid7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2011.11.0282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVerhaegen, Y.10aOrganotins in North Sea brown shrimp (Crangon crangon L.) after implementation of the TBT ban  ap. 979-984.  aThe organotin (OT) compounds tributyltin (TBT) and triphenyltin (TPhT) are potent biocides that have been used ubiquitously in antifouling paints and pesticides since the mid-1970s. These biocides are extremely toxic to marine life, particularly marine gastropod populations. The European Union therefore took measures to reduce the use of TBT-based antifouling paints on ships and ultimately banned these paints in 2003. Despite sufficient data on OT concentrations in marine gastropods, data are scarce for other species such as the North Sea brown shrimp (Crangon crangon), a dominant crustacean species in North Sea inshore benthic communities. The present study provides the first spatial overview of OT concentrations in North Sea brown shrimp. We have compared these data with historical concentrations in shrimp as well as with sediment concentrations. We have also addressed the effect on the shrimp stock and any human health risks associated with the OT concentrations found. TBT and TPhT in shrimp tail muscle ranged from 4 to 124 and from 1 to 24Œºgkg‚Åª¬π DW, respectively. High levels are accumulated in estuarine areas and are clearly related with sediment concentrations (biota-sediment accumulation factor ‚àº10). Levels have decreased approximately 10-fold since the ban took effect, coinciding with a recovery of the shrimp stock after 30years of gradual regression. Furthermore, the OT levels found in brown shrimp no longer present a human health risk.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCrangon crangon 3aEuropean Union 3aGastropoda 3abiocides 3ahistory 3ahuman health 3amuscles 3apaints 3apesticides 3arisk 3asediments 3aships 3ashrimp 3atail 3atoxicity 2aAnimals 2aCrangonidaexmetabolism 2aDietxstatistics & numerical data 2aEnvironmental Monitoring 2aGeologic Sedimentsxchemistry 2aHumans 2aLegislation as Topic 2aOrganotin Compoundsxanalysisxmetabolism. 2aRisk Assessment 2aTrialkyltin Compoundsxanalysisxmetabolism. 2aWater Pollutants, Chemicalxanalysisxmetabolism. 2aWater Pollution, Chemicalxlegislation & jurisprudencexstatistics & numerical data. 3aNorth Sea1 aMonteyne, E.1 aNeudecker, T.1 aTulp, I.1 aSmagghe, G.1 aCooreman, K.1 aRoose, P.1 aParmentier, K.0 tChemosphere.g2012 Mar., v. 86, no. 10 p.979-984dElsevier Ltdx0045-65357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2011.11.0283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02541naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245013400172300001600306520103800322592002801360650000901388650002501397650002601422650001601448650001401464650002401478650002201502650002701524650002201551650001801573650002701591651001301618653002301631653001701654653001501671653002201686700005601708700002201764700003201786700002701818700001901845700001301864773008901877856008401966852000902050655001202059IND60603648920221122043255.0180716e20150615xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060364892DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2015.04.0492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRahman, Md Saifur10aLong-run relationship between sectoral productivity and energy consumption in Malaysia: An aggregated and disaggregated viewpoint  ap. 436-445.  aThis paper investigates the causal relationship between energy consumption and economic productivity in Malaysia at both aggregated and disaggregated levels. The investigation utilises total and sectoral (industrial and manufacturing) productivity growth during the 1971‚Äì2012 period using the modified Granger causality test proposed by Toda and Yamamoto [1] within a multivariate framework. The economy of Malaysia was found to be energy dependent at aggregated and disaggregated levels of national and sectoral economic growth. However, at disaggregate level, inefficient energy use is particularly identified with electricity and coal consumption patterns and their Granger caused negative effects upon GDP (Gross Domestic Product) and manufacturing growth. These findings suggest that policies should focus more on improving energy efficiency and energy saving. Furthermore, since emissions are found to have a close relationship to economic output at national and sectoral levels green technologies are of a highest necessity.  aPublisher supplied data 3acoal 3aeconomic development 3aeconomic productivity 3aelectricity 3aemissions 3aenergy conservation 3aenergy efficiency 3agross domestic product 3aissues and policy 3amanufacturing 3asustainable technology 3aMalaysia 0aEnergy consumption 0aProductivity 0aEfficiency 0aToda and Yamamoto1 aJunsheng, Ha1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0798-63621 aShahari, Farihana1 aMohamed Aslam Gulam Hassan,1 aMasud, Muhammad Mehedi1 aBanna, Hasanul1 aLiya, Ma0 tEnergy.g2015 June 15, v. 86 p.436-445dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2015.04.0493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03726naa a2200685 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245013900170520160800309592002801917650002401945650001901969650002101988650001802009650001302027650001402040650002402054650002402078650001902102650002802121650002402149650002902173650002902202650002502231650002302256650002202279650001902301650001902320650001102339650001002350650001902360650001602379650004302395650001402438650001002452650001202462650002402474650001002498651001202508653001802520653001502538653001202553653001402565700002202579700002102601700002202622700005602644700002002700700005802720700001902778700002102797773011602818856008502934852000903019655001203028IND60675714920221120110124.0200210e202003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067571492DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ttbdis.2019.1013302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSadeddine, Rima10aMolecular identification of protozoal and bacterial organisms in domestic animals and their infesting ticks from north-eastern Algeria  aA molecular survey was undertaken to determine the presence of protozoal and bacterial organisms in 120 ticks and 87 blood samples collected from mammals in north-eastern Algeria. Eight tick species were morphologically identified including 70 Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) annulatus, 23 Rhipicephalus bursa, five Rhipicephalus sanguineus sensu lato, 11 Hyalomma impeltatum, five Hyalomma scupense, two Hyalommma marginatum, one Hyalomma anatolicum and three Ixodes ricinus.

In this study, T. equi and ‚ÄúCandidatus Rickettsia barbariae‚Äù were identified for the first time in Algeria as well as potential new species of Ehrlichia and Anaplasma.Although molecular detection does not indicate vector/reservoir competence when investigating ticks removed from animals, this study expands the knowledge of the microorganisms detected in ticks in north-east of Algeria.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAnaplasma marginale 3aAnaplasma ovis 3aAnaplasma platys 3aBabesia bovis 3aBorrelia 3aEhrlichia 3aHyalomma anatolicum 3aHyalomma marginatum 3aIxodes ricinus 3aRhipicephalus annulatus 3aRhipicephalus bursa 3aRhipicephalus sanguineus 3aRickettsia aeschlimannii 3aRickettsia massiliae 3aTheileria annulata 3aTheileria buffeli 3aTheileria equi 3ablood sampling 3acattle 3agoats 3amicroorganisms 3anew species 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3ascreening 3asheep 3asurveys 3atick-borne diseases 3aticks 3aAlgeria 0aPiroplamorida 0aRickettsia 0aBabesia 0aTheileria1 aDiarra, Adama Zan1 aLaroche, Maureen1 aMediannikov, Oleg1 aRighi, Souad1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6655-71651 aBenakhla, Ahmed1 aDahmana, Handi1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7605-031X1 aRaoult, Didier1 aParola, Philippe0 tTicks and tick-borne diseases.g2020 Mar., v. 11, no. 2 p.101330-dElsevier GmbHwJournal:6305x1877-959X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ttbdis.2019.1013303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03184naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002000149245018400169520171700353592002802070650001102098650001402109650002302123650002902146650002002175650000902195650001202204650001402216650001402230650001102244650001302255650001302268650001702281653002702298653002702325653003002352653002202382653001802404700001902422700001902441700001902460700001602479773012602495856008402621852000902705655001202714IND60744056220221120025132.0211218s2021    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074405622DNAL7 a10.1016/j.crgsc.2021.1001332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSharma, Chandan10aNano-rod like morphology of Ni@Fe3O4-NDCs on interaction of NDC-supported Fe3O4 with nickel NPs: An efficient catalyst for ligand free Chan-Lam coupling reaction in aqueous medium  aNitrogen doped carbons were synthesized and fabricated with magnetite nanoparticles leading to a new magnetic and nitrogen functionalities rich carbon material. This material has dual characteristics as the magnetization of carbons makes it easily separable and the nitrogen moieties act as a binder for both magnetite and metal nanoparticles. This excludes the need for extra binding sites. Nickel and/or iron supported five different catalysts were synthesized and their catalytic activity was tested for Chan-Lam coupling and satisfactory results were obtained with two catalysts- Ni@Fe‚ÄìFe‚ÇÉO‚ÇÑ‚ÄìNDCs and Ni@Fe‚ÇÉO‚ÇÑ‚ÄìNDCs, wherein the monometallic counterpart having an upper edge. The characterization of these catalysts provides sufficient evidence for the unexpected enhanced catalytic activity of the monometallic Ni catalyst as compared to its bimetallic counterpart. The most eye-catching thing observed was the difference in morphology of the two synthesized catalysts, which clearly indicated some major changes in the interaction of the metal nanoparticles with the support material in the two catalysts since same method was adopted for the preparation of both. Additional lattice fringes of NiFe‚ÇÇO‚ÇÑ in the HRTEM images along with their corresponding peaks in the XRD spectrum, and the presence of pure Ni¬≤‚Å∫ species in the XPS spectrum of the monometallic catalyst provides a clear vision of the reason behind the enhanced catalytic activity of the monometallic catalyst. The formation of nano-rod like supported NiFe‚ÇÇO‚ÇÑ particles with increased surface area, mean pore volume and large number of active sites increases the activity of monometallic-Ni for Chan-Lam cross-coupling.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3across-coupling reactions 3agreen chemistry 3airon 3aligands 3amagnetism 3amagnetite 3anickel 3anitrogen 3aresearch 3asurface area 0aNitrogen doped carbons 0aMagnetic nanoparticles 0aNano-rods like morphology 0aChan-Lam coupling 0aRecyclability1 aSharma, Nitika1 aSharma, Shally1 aSharma, Surbhi1 aPaul, Satya0 tCurrent research in green and sustainable chemistry.g2021, v. 4 p.100133-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:27616x2666-08657nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.crgsc.2021.1001333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02294naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100005400151245011300205300001600318520110900334592002801443650001401471650001401485650001801499650001601517653002401533653001601557653000901573653002201582653001801604653002101622653001401643700001801657700001401675700001701689773010801706856008501814852000901899655001201908IND60531389120221122230759.0160723e201610  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053138912DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jenvrad.2016.06.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPomm√©, S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5017-745110aFundamental uncertainty equations for nuclear dating applied to the 140Ba-140La and 227Th-223Ra chronometers  ap. 358-370.  aBasic equations for age dating through activity ratio measurements are presented and applied to nuclear chronometers based on parent-daughter decay. Uncertainty propagation formulae are derived which relate the relative uncertainty on the half-lives and measured activity ratios with the relative uncertainty on the calculated time of a nuclear event. Particular attention is paid to the case of relatively short-lived radionuclides for which the change in decay rate during the measurement is non-negligible. Mathematical solutions are presented to correct the perceived activity ratio and adapt the uncertainty propagation formulae to complete the uncertainty budget. The formulae have been applied to 140Ba-140La chronometry, which is particularly useful for dating a nuclear explosion through measurement of the produced activity ratio of 140La and 140Ba in a finite time interval. They were also applied to the 227Th-223Ra parent-daughter pair produced for therapeutic use. The impact of inaccuracies in the nuclear decay data on the performance of these nuclear chronometers is shown and discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aequations 3ahalf life 3aradionuclides 3auncertainty 0aNuclear chronometry 0aUncertainty 0aCTBT 0aNon-proliferation 0aGeochronology 0aNuclear medicine 0aDosimetry1 aCollins, S.M.1 aHarms, A.1 aJerome, S.M.0 tJournal of environmental radioactivity.g2016 Oct., v. 162-163 p.358-370dElsevier Ltdx0265-931X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvrad.2016.06.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04629naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002500140245016900165520329900334592002803633650002303661650001603684650001403700650002303714650001503737650002103752650002103773650002003794650001103814650001703825650001003842650001203852650001303864650002203877650000903899650001103908650001103919650001003930651001103940700002503951773012303976856007504099852000904174655001204183IND60757866220221119142654.0211125e20211022xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075786622DNAL7 a10.3390/nu131137112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKo≈Çota, Aleksandra 10aAnalysis of Food Habits during Pandemic in a Polish Population-Based Sample of Primary School Adolescents: Diet and Activity of Youth during COVID-19 (DAY-19) Study  aThe improper dietary behaviors of children and adolescents during the COVID-19 pandemic, which are associated with lockdowns and reduced physical activity, are a complex problem, potentially resulting in increased risk of diet-related diseases, including overweight and obesity and their consequences. The aim of the study was to assess the food habits during the COVID-19 pandemic and to define their association with physical activity and body mass changes in a Polish population of primary school adolescents within the Diet and Activity of Youth During COVID-19 (DAY-19) Study. The DAY-19 Study was conducted in June 2020 in a national cohort of 1334 primary school students aged 10‚Äì16 years, recruited based on a stratified random sampling of schools (sampling counties from voivodeships and schools from counties). The Adolescent Food Habits Checklist (AFHC) was used to assess food habits, associated with food purchase, preparation, and consumption, which in the studied group were analyzed separately for the period before (retrospective data) and during the COVID-19 pandemic (prospective data). The recognizable physical activity changes and recognizable body mass changes were also assessed (retrospective data) and respondents were classified as those declaring that their physical activity and body mass decreased, remained stable, or increased during the COVID-19 pandemic. It was observed that during the COVID-19 pandemic the majority of food habits changed in a statistically significant way (p < 0.05). Within food purchase habits, the number of respondents who declared choosing a low-fat lunch away from home decreased, often buying pastries or cakes decreased, and buying a low-fat crisps brand increased (p < 0.05). Within food preparation habits, the number of respondents who declared trying to keep overall fat intake down increased, trying to keep overall sugar intake down increased, eating at least one serving of vegetables or salad with evening meal increased, and usually including some chocolate and/or biscuits in a packed lunch decreased (p < 0.05). Within food consumption habits, the number of respondents who declared making sure that they eat at least one serving of fruit a day increased, eating at least three servings of fruit most days increased, making sure that they eat at least one serving of vegetables or salad a day increased, trying to ensure that they eat plenty of fruit and vegetables increased, often choosing a fruit when they have a snack between meals increased, eating at least three servings of fruit most days increased, and generally trying to have a healthy diet increased (p < 0.05). It was concluded that in the period of the COVID-19 pandemic and resultant remote education, adolescents in Poland presented different food habits than before, while the majority of changes were positive. The positive food purchase, preparation, and consumption habits were observed mainly in sub-groups of adolescents declaring decreased body mass or increased physical activity during the COVID-19 pandemic. It may be suggested that physical activity may support positive changes of dietary behaviors and while combined positive changes of diet and increased physical activity, they may effectively promote body mass reduction in adolescents.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCOVID-19 infection 3aadolescents 3achocolate 3aelementary schools 3afat intake 3afood consumption 3afood preparation 3afood purchasing 3afruits 3ahealthy diet 3alunch 3aobesity 3apandemic 3aphysical activity 3arisk 3asalads 3asugars 3ayouth 3aPoland1 aG≈ÇƒÖbska, Dominika 0 tNutrients.g2021 Oct. 22, v. 13, no. 11dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2271x2072-66437nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu131137113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02288naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245009900169300001400268520084100282592002801123650002001151650002101171650001301192650001601205650002301221650001701244650002301261650001601284650004401300650000701344650002501351653001801376653002401394653003101418653003401449653002401483700002401507700002501531700002101556773014901577856008201726961001301808852000901821655001201830IND60694927520221121100853.0200712e202007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069492752DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fbp.2020.03.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEssandoh, Matthew10aInfluence of methylation on the effectiveness of meat and bone meal protein as a bioflocculant  ap. 55-61.  aIn this study, the enhancement in the application of meat and bone meal (MBM) protein as a bioflocculant was studied through methylation and dilute acid hydrolysis.

Size exclusion chromatography (SEC) coupled with tetra-detection system was used to obtain information about the hydrolyzed MBM and methylated MBM (MeMBM). The MeMBM protein hydrolysate (peak KCE=2.4) showed enhanced flocculant properties compared to the raw MBM hydrolysate (peak KCE=1.8) at all studied experimental conditions including flocculant dose, settling time, and suspension pH.

A total of 3368 serum samples from healthy horses collected prior to export between 2015 and 2018 in Spain were tested for antibodies against T. equi and B. caballi by using a competitive inhibition enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (cELISA). The overall seroprevalence results in Spain revealed that almost a quarter of the horses analysed (24.1 %; 95% CI 22.6‚Äì25.5) could not be exported to countries free from EP. The implementation of prevention measures such as the use of acaricides and daily checks for ticks in horses, as well as regular serological screening of horses in Spain would aid to increase the number of horses exported to other countries.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBabesia caballi 3aTheileria equi 3aacaricides 3aantibodies 3ablood serum 3aeconomic impact 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3aequine piroplasmosis 3aexports 3ahorses 3aindustry 3ascreening 3aserodiagnosis 3aseroprevalence 3aticks 3aSpain 0aExportation1 aPozo, Pilar1 aDorrego, Abel1 aCarvajal, Kelly Alejandra1 aBuendia, Aranzazu1 aGonz√°lez, Sergio,1 ade Juan, Lucia1 aDominguez, Lucas1 aCruz-Lopez, Fatima0 tTicks and tick-borne diseases.g2020 Mar., v. 11, no. 2 p.101329-dElsevier GmbHwJournal:6305x1877-959X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ttbdis.2019.1013293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02212naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245006200166300001600228520111300244592002801357650001701385650001101402650001301413650002401426650000901450650001401459650002001473650002501493653002101518653001101539653001701550653002001567700001501587700001501602700001501617773008901632856008401721852000901805655001201814IND60603649120221122002226.0180716e20150615xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060364912DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2015.04.0512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Yufei13aAn exergy-based approach for hydrogen network integration  ap. 514-524.  aIncreasingly strict environmental and product-quality regulations coupled with the change of crude oil to high-sulfur and heavier oil have increased refineries' hydrogen demand. Various HNI (hydrogen network integration) methods have been used to achieve efficient use of hydrogen by refineries, leading to reduced energy consumption and cost. However, to minimize the energy consumption of a hydrogen network, not only the hydrogen utility consumption but also the energy consumption of the whole network should be taken into account. In this paper, the superstructure and mathematical model for integration of a hydrogen network with purification are established, in which all purification processes are expressed by the same modular. The total exergy consumption is used as the objective function for optimization, which encompasses fresh hydrogen consumption, compression work and energy consumption of purification processes. The energy consumption of a purification process is expressed in terms of its minimum separation work. A case study is used to illustrate the exergy-based optimization approach.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase studies 3aexergy 3ahydrogen 3amathematical models 3aoils 3apetroleum 3aproduct quality 3apurification methods 0aHydrogen network 0aExergy 0aPurification 0aSeparation work1 aWu, Sidong1 aFeng, Xiao1 aDeng, Chun0 tEnergy.g2015 June 15, v. 86 p.514-524dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2015.04.0513Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02745naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245013400167500002200301520166400323592002801987650001502015650001802030650001102048650001502059653002602074653003302100653003202133653002202165653002102187700002202208773008302230856008502313852000902398655001202407IND60531389220221122230855.0160723s2016    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053138922DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jenvrad.2016.06.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPecha, Petr10aInverse modelling for real-time estimation of radiological consequences in the early stage of an accidental radioactivity release  aPre-press version  aA stepwise sequential assimilation algorithm based on optimization approach for recursive parameter estimation and tracking of a radioactive plume propagation in the early stage of a radiation accident is proposed. Predictions of the radiological situation in each time step of the plume propagation are driven by an existing short-term meteorological forecast and the assimilation procedure manipulates the model parameters to match the observations incoming concurrently from the terrain. Mathematically, the task is a typical ill-posed inverse problem estimating parameters of the release. The proposed method is designated as a stepwise re-estimation of the source term release dynamics and an improvement of several input model parameters. It results in more precise determination of the adversely affected areas in the terrain. Non-linear least squares regression methodology is applied for estimation of the unknowns. The fast and adequately accurate segmented Gaussian plume model (SGPM) is used in the first stage of direct (forward) modelling. The subsequent inverse procedure infers (re-estimates) the values of important model parameters from the actual observations. Accuracy and sensitivity of the proposed method for the real-time forecasting of the accident propagation is studied. First, the twin experiment generating noiseless simulated "artificial" observations is studied to verify the minimisation algorithm. Second, the impact of the measurement noise on the re-estimated source release rate is examined. In addition, the presented method can be used as a proposal for more advance statistical techniques using e.g. importance sampling.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3aleast squares 3amodels 3aprediction 0aRadioactivity release 0aAssimilation of measurements 0aIll-posed inversion problem 0aMeasurement noise 0aUrgent emergency1 a≈†m√≠dl, V√°clav,0 tJournal of environmental radioactivity.g2016, dElsevier Ltdx0265-931X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvrad.2016.06.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02718naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002300148245006500171300001300236520145700249592002801706650001501734650001401749650001201763650001301775650002301788650002201811650001501833650001601848650000901864650001301873650001301886650000701899653001401906653001501920653001501935653002101950653001301971700002101984700001702005700002502022773012202047856008202169852000902251655001202260IND60599261720221118030250.0180702e20140215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059926172DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcis.2013.10.0312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKwok, Katrina C.M.10aMechanism of arsenic removal using chitosan and nanochitosan  ap. 1-10.  aChitosan, a natural polysaccharide copolymer of glucosamine and N-acetyl-glucosamine, possesses one free primary amine and two free hydroxyl groups on each glucosamine unit. It has a polycationic nature and an abundance of amine functional groups. The sorption equilibrium and kinetics of arsenate onto chitosan flakes have been studied. The effect of pH on the adsorption capacity and the uptake kinetics is an important parameter to investigate the adsorption mechanism of anionic species such as arsenate ions on the protonated amine groups of chitosan. The equilibrium sorption and batch kinetic studies of arsenate ions on chitosan were performed at initial As concentration of 250‚Äì11,000ŒºgL‚Åª¬π and initial pH ranging from pH=3.50‚Äì5.50. The experimental results showed that initially for approximately the first 30min there is a rapid and high adsorption of arsenate ions onto the chitosan leading to a maximum uptake capacity after this short time. However, this stage is followed by a slow desorption of arsenate from the chitosan with a steady increase in solution pH. A novel reversible pseudo-first order kinetic model was developed and applied to correlate this newly reported adsorption‚Äìdesorption phenomenon. The physical and chemical properties of chitosan were studied and presented in terms of its surface and structural properties such as the degree of deacetylation, crystallinity, surface charge and its swelling properties.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3aarsenates 3aarsenic 3achitosan 3acomposite polymers 3acrystal structure 3adesorption 3aglucosamine 3aions 3akinetics 3amoieties 3apH 0aMechanism 0aAdsorption 0aDesorption 0aArsenate removal 0aChitosan1 aKoong, Len Foong1 aChen, Guohua1 aMcKay, G.q(Gordon),0 tJournal of colloid and interface science.g2014 Feb. 15, v. 416 p.1-10dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12461x0021-97977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2013.10.0313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03411naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100006000149245017000209520165700379592002802036650002102064650003102085650002502116650002202141650002002163650001902183650001302202650001802215650001302233650001102246653003102257653002702288653000802315653002502323700005802348700006002406700006102466700006202527700006002589700002102649700006402670773012602734856008402860852000902944655001202953IND60744056720221122042554.0211218s2021    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074405672DNAL7 a10.1016/j.crgsc.2021.1001382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShinde, Rohit S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6420-803310aDesign, fabrication, antitubercular, antibacterial, antifungal and antioxidant study of silver doped ZnO and CuO nano candidates: A comparative pharmacological study  aIn the present study, ZnO, CuO, CuO/ZnO, 5% Ag/CuO, 10% Ag/CuO, 5%Ag/ZnO, and 10% Ag/ZnO NPs were synthesized to develop bio-nano medicines with potent antibacterial, antifungal, and antioxidant properties. XRD, HR-SEM, EDAX, and HR-TEM spectral analyses were used to establish the structural characteristics of the synthesized NPs. According to the XRD study, the average particle size for CuO NPs was 23.42¬†‚Äãnm, for ZnO NPs it was 28.00¬†‚Äãnm, and for CuO/ZnO nanocomposite; 25.58¬†‚Äãnm. The agglomeration of NPs in ZnO and CuO NPs, as well as the presence of agglomeration and nanorods in the CuO‚ÄìZnO nanocomposite, were identified using HR-SEM. In the present study, CuO NPs have a cubic crystal structure, whereas ZnO NPs have a hexagonal crystal structure, as confirmed by HR-TEM. Both cubic and hexagonal crystal lattices were found in the CuO/ZnO nanocomposites. The Ag incorporation into the ZnO and CuO NPs was confirmed using the EDAX. Disc diffusion assay was used to access the antibacterial and antifungal activities whereas REMA assay was used to establish MIC values. Antibacterial analyses were performed against S.¬†aureus, B.¬†subtilis, B.¬†megaterium, Escherichia coli, and M.¬†tuberculosis, while antifungal studies were conducted on R.¬†oryzae, M.¬†mucido, A.¬†niger, and C.albicans. The antimicrobial activities of ZnO NPs were found to be more influenced by Ag incorporation than CuO NPs. The optimal dopant for enhancing the antimicrobial activities of the synthesized ZnO NPs was found to be 5% Ag. Furthermore, DPPH and OH radical scavenging results uncovered that synthesized NPs possessed good antioxidant potential.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aMycobacterium tuberculosis 3aantioxidant activity 3acrystal structure 3agreen chemistry 3ananocomposites 3ananorods 3aparticle size 3aresearch 3asilver 0aSilver doped nanomaterials 0aAntimicrobial activity 0aTEM 0aDisk diffusion assay1 aMore, Rahul A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8201-46221 aAdole, Vishnu A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7691-78841 aKoli, Prashant B.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8501-82201 aPawar, Thansing B.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2032-31091 aJagdale, Bapu S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2419-74101 aDesale, Bhatu S.1 aSarnikar, Yuvaraj P.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3022-01490 tCurrent research in green and sustainable chemistry.g2021, v. 4 p.100138-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:27616x2666-08657nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.crgsc.2021.1001383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01471naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001400140245016700154300001800321520038400339592002800723650002300751650001300774650001200787650002300799650001100822700001700833700001300850700001800863700001600881700002000897773013300917856007401050852000901124655001201133IND60698230320221120104037.0200610e20200609xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069823032DNAL7 a10.1039/d0cc02550j2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZeng, Hao10aThree component hydroxyletherification and hydroxylazidation of (trifluoromethyl)alkenes: access to Œ±-trifluoromethyl Œ≤-heteroatom substituted tertiary alcohols  ap. 6241-6244.  aThe three component hydroxyletherification and hydroxylazidation reactions of (trifluoromethyl)alkenes are reported, providing various useful Œ±-trifluoromethyl Œ≤-heteroatom substituted tertiary alcohols in high yields.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of extended colostrum feeding on plasma concentration of GLP-1. Holstein bull calves (n = 27) were fed pooled colostrum at 7.5% of birth body weight at 2 h after birth and then fed mature milk (M), a 50:50 mixture of pooled colostrum and milk (CM), or pooled colostrum (C; n = 9 for each treatment) at 5% of birth body weight at 12 h after birth and every 12 h thereafter until 72 h after birth. Blood samples were obtained before (1 and 2 h after birth) and after (until 72 h after birth; 42 time points) the first colostrum feeding, and plasma concentrations of glucose, insulin, and GLP-1 were measured. Data were analyzed by ANOVA of JMP 13 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC) with treatment, time, and treatment √ó time interaction as fixed effects. Treatment √ó time interaction was observed for plasma insulin and glucose concentrations, which were mainly the result of lower concentrations from 1 to 2 d after birth for C compared with M. Conversely, on d 3 after birth, the difference between treatments was not observed for insulin and glucose. For the entire experimental period, plasma GLP-1 concentration was higher for C (2.25 ng/mL) compared with M (1.41 ng/mL) and tended to be higher compared with CM (1.58 ng/mL). A treatment √ó time interaction was observed for GLP-1, but unlike glucose and insulin, this was mainly the result of higher concentrations from 54 to 72 h after birth (on d 3 after birth) for C compared with M or CM. Postprandial plasma concentration of glucose was not correlated with that of GLP-1 but was positively correlated with that of insulin for the 4-h period after feeding on d 1 (r = 0.30) and d 3 after birth (r = 0.33). Postprandial plasma concentration of GLP-1 was positively correlated with that of insulin for the 4-h period after feeding on d 3 after birth (r = 0.20). These results indicate that extended colostrum feeding may increase plasma GLP-1 concentrations, especially 3 d after birth, but further study is necessary to determine the effect on plasma insulin and glucose concentrations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHolstein 3aanalysis of variance 3ablood sampling 3abody weight 3abulls 3acalves 3acolostrum 3adata analysis 3aglucagon-like peptide 1 3aglucose 3ahomeostasis 3ainsulin 3ainsulin secretion 3amilk 3aneonates 0aglucagon-like peptide 1 0aglucose homeostasis 0acalf1 aPyo, J.1 aPletts, S.1 aGuan, L.L.1 aSteele, M.A.1 aSugino, T.0 tJournal of dairy science.g2019 May, v. 102, no. 5 p.4619-4627dElsevier Inc.aAmerican Dairy Science AssociationwJournal:jnl45500x0022-03027nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3168/jds.2018-156163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02847naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001600148245008800164300001100252520156200263592002801825650001201853650001101865650001601876650001201892650001501904650002401919650002601943650002601969650001701995650002502012650001902037650002702056650001302083650002602096650002102122650002302143650002202166700002102188773011202209856008302321852000902404655001202413IND60793548320221116145149.0220929e202212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079354832DNAL7 a10.1186/s13213-022-01689-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Jing10aEffects of biochar on soil microbial diversity and community structure in clay soil  ap. 35.  aPURPOSE: We determined the microbial community diversity and structure in soil samples under different amounts of biochar added. Meanwhile, we also researched the relationships between soil microbial and soil physicochemical properties. METHOD: In this study, a field experiment was set up, with a total of three experimental treatments: no biochar application, 10 t/m¬≥ biochar application, and 20 t/m¬≥ application. High-throughput sequencing technologies were used for soil samples of different treatment groups to understand soil microbial diversity and community structure. RESULTS: We found that the soil physicochemical properties after biochar addition were better than those without biochar addition, and the alpha diversity was higher in biochar addition level of 20 t/m¬≥ than other processing groups. Proteobacteria, Cyanobacteria, and Actinobacteria were the dominant phyla of this study. The dominant genera were Skermanella, Nostoc, Frankia, and Unclassified-p-protecbacteria. At the gate level, Actinobacteria had significant differences among the three groups with different addition amounts. The microbial community structure was mainly influenced by soil porosity, soil moisture content, nitrogen fertilizer, and potassium fertilizer other than soil phosphate fertilizer and organic matter. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggested that changes under different amounts of biochar added generate changes in soil physicochemical properties and control the soil composition of microbial communities. This provides a new basis for soil improvement.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFrankia 3aNostoc 3aSkermanella 3abiochar 3aclay soils 3acommunity structure 3afield experimentation 3amicrobial communities 3amicrobiology 3anitrogen fertilizers 3aorganic matter 3aphosphorus fertilizers 3aporosity 3apotassium fertilizers 3asoil composition 3asoil water content 3aspecies diversity1 aShen, Jiang-Long0 tAnnals of microbiology.g2022 Dec., v. 72, no. 1 p.35-35dBioMed CentralwJournal:jnl62868x1590-42617nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13213-022-01689-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02406naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001800152245012600170500001900296520112100315592002801436650001501464650001001479650002101489650001201510650002501522650001201547650001101559650001301570650001401583653003201597653002601629653001001655700001401665700002001679700001901699700001701718700001801735700001601753773010701769856008701876852000901963655001201972IND60694928120221121170830.0201024e202009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069492812DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2020.1235172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLai, Chenhuan10aFacilitating enzymatic digestibility of larch by in-situ lignin modification during combined acid and alkali pretreatment  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aTo overcome the recalcitrance of residual lignins in acid-pretreated larch (AL), a combined acid and alkali pretreatment with in-situ lignin modification was developed in this study. The results showed that introducing in-situ lignin modification with 2-naphthol to acid pretreatment (160 and 180 ·µíC) improved the enzymatic digestibility of AL by 12.7-14.4%, through suppressing lignin repolymerization. The obviously higher improvement (57.8-88.3%) was achieved by applying alkali post-treatment (90 ·µíC) with poly (ethylene glycol) diglycidyl ether (PEGDE) on AL, mainly due to the function of in-situ lignin modification with PEGDE for reducing enzyme non-productive binding on lignins. More importantly, the synergism of 2-naphthol and PEGDE modification facilitated the enzymatic hydrolysis of AL more significantly. Its beneficial mechanism was explored by investigating the effects of in-situ lignin modification on lignin properties, including extraction yields, functional groups, and enzyme affinity of lignins. Results will give insights into establishing an efficient pretreatment of softwood biomass.  aPublisher supplied data 3a2-naphthol 3aLarix 3aalkali treatment 3abiomass 3aenzymatic hydrolysis 3aenzymes 3alignin 3asoftwood 3asynergism 0aIn-situ lignin modification 0aCombined pretreatment 0aLarch1 aJia, Yuan1 aZhou, Chengfeng1 aYang, Chundong1 aShen, Buzhen1 aZhang, Daihui1 aYong, Qiang0 tBioresource technology.g2020 Sept., v. 311 p.123517-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46263x0960-85247nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2020.1235173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02018naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005800148245007900206300001600285520099700301592002801298650005801326650001901384650001401403650001101417700002101428700001801449700002101467773013601488856008301624852000901707655001201716IND60794783620221120112134.0220929e202210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079478362DNAL7 a10.1007/s10640-021-00561-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAntoci, Angelo1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3719-043710aAdoption Gaps of Environmental Adaptation Technologies with Public Effects  ap. 313-339.  aAs the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (2018) testifies, the world is a long way from halting climate change, let alone reverting it. The existence of adaptation and mitigation technologies did not prove sufficient, their adoption being respectively faulted or hindered by the presence of externalities. In this work, we study how externalities, whether positive or negative, lead the system away from Pareto-dominant (social optimum) states, towards Pareto-dominated ones. We show that adoption gaps, i.e. differences between socially optimum vs current adoption shares, of both (mal)adaptation and mitigation technologies are caused by the externalities emitted. In particular, over-adoption may occur for maladaptive technologies, whereas under-adoption may occur in case of mitigation. We employ a model with two regions at different stages of development and also derive relevant considerations on possible counterproductive effects of green policies and environmental dumping.  aPublisher supplied data 3aUnited Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change 3aclimate change 3aeconomics 3amodels1 aBorghesi, Simone1 aGaldi, Giulio1 aVergalli, Sergio0 tEnvironmental and resource economics.g2022 Oct., v. 83, no. 2 p.313-339dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl3871699x0924-64607nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10640-021-00561-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03203naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002700111040001800138100003100156245021700187300001800404520120200422592002801624650002101652650002201673650001601695650001601711650001001727650002001737650004301757650001601800650002001816650002701836650001701863650001201880650002601892650003601918650005001954650004002004650002002044650003102064650002702095650002702122650002802149650002202177651001502199651001502214653001802229653001202247653001602259653000902275653002002284700002102304700002302325700002402348773013302372852000902505856007502514655001202589IND4464643420160905000000.0160905e20120725xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446464342DNAL7 a227384322pmid7 a10.1021/jf301403f2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGranados-Chinchilla, Fabio12aA Novel Green Chemistry Method for Nonaqueous Extraction and High-Performance Liquid Chromatography Detection of First-, Second-, and Third-Generation Tetracyclines, 4-Epitetracycline, and Tylosin in Animal Feeds  ap. 7121-7128.  aAlthough tetracyclines and macrolides are common additives for animal nutrition, methods for their simultaneous determination in animal feeds are nonexistent. By coupling an organic extraction and solid-phase extraction cleanup to a high-performance liquid chromatography separation and a nonaqueous postcolumn derivatization, we succeeded in detecting from 0.2 to 24.0 Œºg kg‚Äì¬π of tetracycline, oxytetracycline, chlortetracycline, doxycycline, tigecycline, and 4-epitetracycline in this complex and heterogeneous matrix. Minocycline and tylosin could also be detected with our procedure, but using UV spectrophotometry (1.5 ‚â§ LOD ‚â§ 1.9 mg kg‚Äì¬π). Linear responses with correlation coefficients between 0.996 and 0.999 were obtained for all analytes in the 0.5‚Äì10 mg kg‚Äì¬π concentration range. Average recoveries between 59 and 97% and between 98 and 102% were obtained for the tetracyclines and tylosin, respectively. Replicate standard deviations were typically below 5%. When this method was applied to 20 feeds marketed in Costa Rica, we detected labeling inconsistencies, banned mixtures of tetracyclines, and tetracycline concentrations that contravene international regulation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal nutrition 3achlortetracycline 3acorrelation 3adoxycycline 3afeeds 3agreen chemistry 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3aminocycline 3aoxytetracycline 3asolid phase extraction 3atetracycline 3atylosin 2aAnimal Feedxanalysis 2aAnti-Bacterial Agentsxanalysis 2aChromatography, High Pressure Liquidxmethods 2aGreen Chemistry Technologyxmethods 2aQuality Control 2aReproducibility of Results 2aSolid Phase Extraction 2aTetracyclinexanalysis 2aTetracyclinesxanalysis 2aTylosinxanalysis 3aCosta Rica 0aCosta Rica 0atetracyclines 0atylosin 0aanimal feed 0aHPLC 0agreen chemistry1 aS√°nchez, Jorge,1 aGarc√≠a, Fernando,1 aRodr√≠guez, C√©sar,0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2012 July 25, v. 60, no. 29 p.7121-7128dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-51187nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fjf301403f3Available from publisher's site 7aarticle02136naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002200140245009400162300001600256520106500272592002801337650000901365650001101374650003101385650002701416650000701443650001601450650000901466650001301475650002301488650001601511650001101527700001801538773013401556856007501690852000901765655001201774IND60765034420221119024913.0220419e20111112xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076503442DNAL7 a10.17221/3322-cjfs2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aR≈Ø≈æiƒçkov√°, J.10aDetermination of selected parameters of quality of the dairy products by NIR spectroscopy  ap. 255-260.  aThe possibility of the application of near-infrared spectroscopy to the analysis of the selected parameters of quality of the dairy products was followed. The contents of solids and fat, as well as pH in yoghurts (also the titrable acidity), milk semolina, and milk rice were determined. The samples were analysed by reference methods and by FT NIR spectroscope at integrating sphere within reflectance mode in the wavelength range of 10 000&ndash;4&nbsp;000 cm<sup>&ndash;1 </sup>with 100&nbsp;scans. To develop the calibration model for the components examined, the partial least squares (PLS) was used and this model was validated by full cross validation. The highest correlation coefficients were found with yoghurt: 0.998 (solids), 0.989 (fat), 0.875 (pH) and 0.989 (titrable acidity), with milk semolina: 0.967 (solids), 0.983 (fat) and 0.992 (pH), and with milk rice: 0.987 (solids), 0.990 (fat) and 0.852 (pH). The results of this study showed the availability of NIR spectroscopy for a quick and non-destructive analysis of the dairy products. &nbsp;  aPublisher supplied data 3amilk 3amodels 3anear-infrared spectroscopy 3anondestructive methods 3apH 3areflectance 3arice 3asemolina 3atitratable acidity 3awavelengths 3ayogurt1 a≈†ustov√°, K.0 tCzech Journal of Food Sciences.g, v. 24, no. 6 p.255-260dCzech Academy of Agricultural ScienceswJournal:21225x1805-93177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.17221/3322-cjfs3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03759naa a2200829 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002000153245016300173300001600336520139600352592002801748650001901776650001801795650001501813650002101828650001901849650002301868650001101891650001301902650002601915650002101941650001901962650001201981650002401993650001202017650004202029650001802071650004402089650001302133650001702146650001002163653000902173653000802182653001002190653001802200653002202218653002202240653001002262653001802272653002202290653002202312653001002334653001402344653001502358653001202373653001402385653001502399653000902414653000902423653002302432653002402455653001902479653002902498653003102527653002002558700001502578700001802593700001502611700002102626700001502647700001602662700002102678700001502699773010702714856008702821852000902908655001202917IND60562463820221120193719.0170719e20160901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056246382DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2016.04.1092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 a≈Åawniczak, ≈Å.10aInfluence of oligomeric herbicidal ionic liquids with MCPA and Dicamba anions on the community structure of autochthonic bacteria present in agricultural soil  ap. 247-255.  aThe aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of selected herbicidal ionic liquids (HILs), which exhibit high efficacy in terms of weed control and low toxicity, but may be persistent due to limited biodegradability, on the community structure of autochthonic bacteria present in agricultural soil. Four different oligomeric HILs (with two types of cations and different ratio of herbicidal anions) were synthesized and characterized by employing 1H and 13C NMR. The results of biodegradation assay indicated that none of the tested HILs could be classified as readily biodegradable (biodegradation rate ranged from 0 to 7%). The conducted field studies confirmed that the herbicidal efficacy of the HILs was higher compared to the reference herbicide mixture by 10 to 30%, depending on the dose and weed species. After termination of field studies, the soil treated with the tested HILs was subjected to next generation sequencing in order to investigate the potential changes in the bacterial community structure. Proteobacteria was the dominant phylum in all studied samples. Treatment with the studied HILs resulted in an increase of Actinobacteria compared to the reference herbicidal mixture. Differenced among the studied HILs were generally associated with a significantly higher abundance of Bacteroidetes in case of 1-HIL-Dicamba 1/3 and Firmicutes in case of 2-HIL-Dicamba 1/3.  aPublisher supplied data 3aActinobacteria 3aBacteroidetes 3aFirmicutes 3aMCPA (herbicide) 3aProteobacteria 3aagricultural soils 3aanions 3abacteria 3abacterial communities 3abiodegradability 3abiodegradation 3acations 3acommunity structure 3adicamba 3ahigh-throughput nucleotide sequencing 3aionic liquids 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3atoxicity 3aweed control 3aweeds 0aHILs 0aILs 0a1-HIL 0a1-HIL-Dicamba 0a1-HIL-Dicamba 1/2 0a1-HIL-Dicamba 1/3 0a2-HIL 0a2-HIL-Dicamba 0a2-HIL-Dicamba 1/2 0a2-HIL-Dicamba 1/3 0a2,4-D 0aBentazone 0aClopyralid 0aDicamba 0aFomesafen 0aGlyphosate 0aMCPA 0aMCPP 0aMetsulfuron-methyl 0aCommunity structure 0aBiodegradation 0aHerbicidal ionic liquids 0aNext generation sequencing 0aSoil microbiota1 aSyguda, A.1 aBorkowski, A.1 aCyplik, P.1 aMarcinkowska, K.1 aWolko, ≈Å.1 aPraczyk, T.1 aChrzanowski, ≈Å.1 aPernak, J.0 tScience of the total environment.g2016 Sept. 01, v. 563-564 p.247-255dElsevier B.V.x0048-96977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2016.04.1093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02870naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245017100168300001600339520143000355592002801785650001801813650002301831650001001854650001801864650001401882650001401896650002001910650001401930650001001944651001001954653002501964653002001989653001802009653001902027653002402046653002502070700002002095700001902115700002002134700001502154700002102169773011602190856008502306852000902391655001202400IND60526218920221119202017.0190403e20160201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052621892DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foreco.2015.11.0412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQian, Shenhua10aEffective conservation measures are needed for wild Cathaya argyrophylla populations in China: Insights from the population structure and regeneration characteristics  ap. 358-367.  aOwing to the existence of global Pleistocene refugia, the relict and ancient component of the modern endemic flora is considerable in South-Central China. Study of these relict species helps to understand past and recent ecological processes affecting species persistence, and also provides knowledge to guide human-assisted management and conservation practice. In this study, we investigated the current status of the remnant populations of Cathaya argyrophylla, one of the emblematic ‚Äúliving fossils‚Äù, growing in the Dalou Mountains of South-Central China. We quantified the population structure of C. argyrophylla and investigated demographic changes of seedlings over a ten year period to learn the plant‚Äôs regeneration patterns following the establishment of two national and provincial nature reserves in late 1970s. Notable ‚Äúgaps‚Äù in age structure over 40years were found, suggesting significant recruitment failures in these scattered population since the establishment of the nature reserves. Further, the number of dead individuals peaked at ages between 40 and 80years and the seedlings showed high mortality in the past 10years, probably due to intensified competition from the nearby broad-leaved trees and the reduction of suitable micro-habitats. These facts indicated that attention needs to be paid and follow-up measures should be taken to more effectively conserve C. argyrophylla in the future.  aPublisher supplied data 3aage structure 3aconservation areas 3aflora 3amicrohabitats 3amortality 3amountains 3arefuge habitats 3aseedlings 3atrees 3aChina 0aCathaya argyrophylla 0aDalou Mountains 0aLiving fossil 0aNature reserve 0aPopulation dynamics 0aSeedling recruitment1 aYang, Yongchuan1 aTang, Cindy Q.1 aMomohara, Arata1 aYi, Sirong1 aOhsawa, Masahiko0 tForest ecology and management.g2016 Feb. 01, v. 361 p.358-367dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl9013x0378-11277nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2015.11.0413Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04224naa a2200793 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001700153245012600170300001600296520213600312592002802448650002702476650002702503650001102530650001902541650001802560650003102578650001102609650004102620650003002661650003702691650001502728650001402743653000802757653000702765653000802772653000902780653000802789653000902797653000702806653001002813653000702823653000802830653000802838653000802846653000802854653000802862653000702870653000702877653000702884653000702891653000802898653000802906653000702914653000802921653000802929653000802937653001702945653003302962653002802995653002703023700002003050700001603070700001903086700002103105700001903126700002003145700001403165700001503179700002103194773010703215856008703322852000903409655001203418IND60562463920221120163455.0170719e20160901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056246392DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2016.04.1102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTuikka, A.I.10aPredicting the bioaccumulation of polyaromatic hydrocarbons and polychlorinated biphenyls in benthic animals in sediments  ap. 396-404.  aThere were two main objectives in this study. The first was to compare the accuracy of different prediction methods for the chemical concentrations of polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in the organism, based on the measured chemical concentrations existing in sediment dry matter or pore water. The predicted tissue concentrations were compared to the measured ones after 28-day laboratory test using oligochaeta worms (Lumbriculus variegatus). The second objective was to compare the bioaccumulation of PAHs and PCBs in the laboratory test with the in situ bioaccumulation of these compounds. Using the traditional organic carbon-water partitioning model, tissue concentrations were greatly overestimated, based on the concentrations in the sediment dry matter. Use of an additional correction factor for black carbon with a two-carbon model, significantly improved the bioaccumulation predictions, thus confirming that black carbon was important in binding the chemicals and reducing their accumulation. The predicted PAH tissue concentrations were, however, high compared to the observed values. The chemical concentrations were most accurately predicted from their freely dissolved pore water concentrations, determined using equilibrium passive sampling. The patterns of PCB and PAH accumulation in sediments for laboratory-exposed L. variegatus were similar to those in field-collected Lumbriculidae worms. Field-collected benthic invertebrates and L. variegatus accumulated less PAHs than PCBs with similar lipophilicity. The biota to sediment accumulation factors of PAHs tended to decrease with increasing sediment organic carbon normalized concentrations. The presented data yields bioconcentration factors (BCF) describing the chemical water-lipid partition, which were found to be higher than the octanol-water partition coefficients, but on a similar level with BCFs drawn from relevant literature. In conclusion, using the two-carbon model method, or the measured freely dissolved pore water concentrations method is recommended for predicting the bioaccumulation of PAHs and PCBs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLumbriculus variegatus 3abioaccumulation factor 3acarbon 3ahydrophobicity 3ainvertebrates 3alaboratory experimentation 3amodels 3aoctanol-water partition coefficients 3apolychlorinated biphenyls 3apolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 3aprediction 3asediments 0aAOC 0aBC 0aBCF 0aBSAF 0aEqL 0aEqPS 0aMB 0amsPAF 0aOC 0aPAH 0aPCB 0aPOP 0aTOC 0aTPH 0aTU 0aA1 0aA3 0aLB 0aPAR 0aPLC 0aSE 0aSRV 0aPAH 0aPCB 0aBlack carbon 0aEquilibrium passive sampling 0aBioconcentration factor 0aLumbriculus variegatus1 aLepp√§nen, M.T.1 aAkkanen, J.1 aSormunen, A.J.1 aLeonards, P.E.G.1 avan Hattum, B.1 avan Vliet, L.A.1 aBrack, W.1 aSmedes, F.1 aKukkonen, J.V.K.0 tScience of the total environment.g2016 Sept. 01, v. 563-564 p.396-404dElsevier B.V.x0048-96977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2016.04.1103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02510naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094024002200130024001900152040001800171100001300189245007500202300001600277506007600293520121000369592002801579506003701607650003601644650001701680650002001697650003601717650001301753650001501766650002401781700001501805700002001820700002101840700002101861700002301882700001801905773007401923856008201997852000902079655001202088IND60551685720221207063021.0161019e20141023xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055168572DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cell.2014.09.0322doi7 aPMC42430422pmcid7 a254171122pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJia, Jie10aTarget-Selective Protein S-Nitrosylation by Sequence Motif Recognition  ap. 623-634.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aS-nitrosylation is a ubiquitous protein modification emerging as a principal mechanism of nitric oxide (NO)-mediated signal transduction and cell function. S-nitrosylases can use NO synthase (NOS)-derived NO to modify selected cysteines in target proteins. Despite proteomic identification of over a thousand S-nitrosylated proteins, few S-nitrosylases have been identified. Moreover, mechanisms underlying site-selective S-nitrosylation and the potential role of specific sequence motifs remain largely unknown. Here, we describe a stimulus-inducible, heterotrimeric S-nitrosylase complex consisting of inducible NOS (iNOS), S100A8, and S100A9. S100A9 exhibits transnitrosylase activity, shuttling NO from iNOS to the target protein, whereas S100A8 and S100A9 coordinately direct site selection. A family of proteins S-nitrosylated by iNOS-S100A8/A9 were revealed by proteomic analysis. A conserved I/L-X-C-X2-D/E motif was necessary and sufficient for iNOS-S100A8/A9-mediated S-nitrosylation. These results reveal an elusive parallel between protein S-nitrosylation and phosphorylation, namely, stimulus-dependent posttranslational modification of selected targets by primary sequence motif recognition.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3ainducible nitric oxide synthase 3anitric oxide 3aphosphorylation 3apost-translational modification 3aproteins 3aproteomics 3asignal transduction1 aArif, Abul1 aTerenzi, Fulvia1 aWillard, Belinda1 aPlow, Edward¬†F.1 aHazen, Stanley¬†L.1 aFox, Paul¬†L.0 tCell.g2014 Oct. 23, v. 159 p.623-634dElsevier Inc.x0092-86747nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2014.09.0323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02738naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002200145245012000167300001600287500001900303520169100322592002802013650001802041650001702059650001302076650001602089650001602105650001502121650001102136650001802147650001602165650001302181700002302194773010202217856004802319852000902367655001202376IND6037047620221120150757.0210726e201112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND603704762DNAL7 a10.1007/s11829-011-9148-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAndersson, Petter10aImmigration of olfactory searching insects into host plant patches: testing scaling rules for olfactory information  ap. 269-277.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aHerbivorous insects are commonly faced with host plants being distributed in scattered patches across a landscape. Immigration rates into habitat patches may strongly depend on the sensory cues used in the patch location process, and immigration rates of insects can be predicted based on the scaling of sensory cues. Here, we tested recent estimates of the scaling of olfactory information to patch size, which predicts a scaling coefficient Œ∂¬†‚âà¬†‚àí0.5 (A Œ∂ , where A¬†=¬†patch size, Œ∂¬†=¬†scaling coefficient). We predicted that immigration rates of olfactory searching insects into patches of different sizes should scale according to the estimated slope. We investigated attraction of the weevils Cionus tuberculosus and Cionus scrophulariae to odors from figwort Scrophularia nodosa and quantified immigration rates of weevils into differently sized patches. We also investigated oviposition rates of the sawfly Tenthredo scrophulariae. The slope in the regression between density and patch size for herbivores was then compared with the predicted scaling coefficient. Using olfactometers, we found that weevils were attracted to figwort odors. Weevil densities were significantly affected by patch size, and the slope in the relationship between density and patch size was Œ∂¬†=¬†‚àí0.53. The slope in the relationship between larval densities of sawflies and patch size was less negative with a slope of Œ∂¬†=¬†‚àí0.15, indicating differences in search behavior compared with the weevils. The density‚Äìpatch size relationship for the weevils closely matched the predicted slope and supported the previous estimations of the scaling of olfactory information to patch size.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCurculionidae 3aScrophularia 3ahabitats 3ahost plants 3aimmigration 3alandscapes 3alarvae 3aolfactometers 3aoviposition 3asawflies1 aHamb√§ck, Peter A.0 tArthropod-plant interactions.g2011 Dec., v. 5, no. 4 p.269-277dSpringer-Verlagx1872-88557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11829-011-9148-1  aDNAL 7aarticle02877naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001400140245013300154300002000287520142300307592002801730650002201758650002201780650001201802650001401814650001101828650003701839650001601876650001001892650001901902650001301921650001701934650001901951650001901970650002501989650001802014650001502032650003302047650002102080650001702101650003702118700001702155700001602172773012302188856007502311852000902386655001202395IND60641621920221120202046.0220513e20170522xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064162192DNAL7 a10.1039/c7ra02760e2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHe, Qiong10aHeterostructured Bi‚ÇÇO‚ÇÉ/Bi‚ÇÇMoO‚ÇÜ nanocomposites: simple construction and enhanced visible-light photocatalytic performance  ap. 27089-27099.  aHeterostructured Bi‚ÇÇO‚ÇÉ/Bi‚ÇÇMoO‚ÇÜ nanocomposites with enhanced visible-light photocatalytic activity are successfully constructed by a simple two-step route, employing bismuth nitrate and sodium molybdate as the main raw materials in the presence of polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP). The phase and the morphology of the as-prepared composites are characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), (high-resolution) transmission electron microscopy (TEM/HRTEM), and energy dispersive spectrometry (EDS). It is found that heterostructured Bi‚ÇÇO‚ÇÉ/Bi‚ÇÇMoO‚ÇÜ nanocomposites exhibit stronger catalytic activities for the degradation of Rhodamine B (RhB) and 2,4-dinitrophenol (2,4-DNP) under the irradiation of visible light than the single component (Bi‚ÇÇO‚ÇÉ or Bi‚ÇÇMoO‚ÇÜ). The above enhanced photocatalytic performance should be attributed to the formation of the p‚Äìn junction between the p-type Bi‚ÇÇO‚ÇÉ and n-type Bi‚ÇÇMoO‚ÇÜ, which effectively halts the fast recombination of photogenerated electrons and holes. Moreover, the as-obtained Bi‚ÇÇO‚ÇÉ/Bi‚ÇÇMoO‚ÇÜ nano-heterostructures also display improved photoelectochemistry performance and high photochemical stability, which is important for conquering the photo-corrosion of photocatalysts. Also, the present work is a useful attempt for the design of new visible-light photocatalytic materials with heterojunction structures.  aPublisher supplied data 3a2,4-dinitrophenol 3aX-ray diffraction 3abismuth 3aelectrons 3aenergy 3aenergy-dispersive X-ray analysis 3airradiation 3alight 3ananocomposites 3anitrates 3anitrophenols 3aphotocatalysis 3aphotocatalysts 3apolyvinylpyrrolidone 3araw materials 3arhodamines 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asodium molybdate 3aspectroscopy 3atransmission electron microscopy1 aNi, Yonghong1 aYe, Shiyong0 tRSC advances.g2017 May 22, v. 7, no. 43 p.27089-27099dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c7ra02760e3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02120naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100005200147245005900199300001300258500001900271520097800290592002801268650002101296650001101317650000901328650001901337650002001356650001601376650001501392650000901407650001701416650001401433650001201447650000901459650001001468650001301478700002001491773010801511856008201619852000901701655001201710IND60707622520221119103117.0210201e202102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070762252DNAL7 a10.1016/j.mib.2020.07.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Bo1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8560-907110aHepatitis E virus: host tropism and zoonotic infection  ap. 8-15.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aHepatitis E virus (HEV), the causative agent of hepatitis E, is an understudied but important pathogen. HEV typically causes self-limiting acute viral hepatitis, however chronic infection with neurological and other extrahepatic manifestations has increasingly become a significant clinical problem. The discovery of swine HEV from pigs and demonstration of its zoonotic potential led to the genetic identification of very diverse HEV strains from more than a dozen other animal species. HEV strains from pig, rabbit, deer, camel, and rat have been shown to cross species barriers and infect humans. Zoonotic HEV infections through consumption of raw or undercooked animal meat or direct contact with infected animals have been reported. The discovery of a large number of animal HEV variants does provide an opportunity to develop useful animal models for HEV. In this mini-review, we discuss recent advances in HEV host range, and cross-species and zoonotic transmission.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOrthohepevirus A 3acamels 3adeer 3adirect contact 3agenetic testing 3ahepatitis E 3ahost range 3ameat 3amicrobiology 3apathogens 3arabbits 3arats 3aswine 3azoonoses1 aMeng, Xiang-Jin0 tCurrent opinion in microbiology.g2021 Feb., v. 59 p.8-15dElsevier LtdwJournal:12432x1369-52747nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.mib.2020.07.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03672naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094024002200135024001900157040001800176100002400194245014500218300001600363506007600379520183900455592002802294506003702322650003002359650001202389650001302401650001902414650001202433650001502445650001502460650002202475650002502497650001402522650002902536650002002565651001502585653001202600653001602612653001402628653001402642653002302656653001802679700001602697700002902713700002602742700002102768700002402789700002202813700002402835700002002859773010702879856008702986852000903073655001203082IND60562464120221207065718.0170719e20160901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056246412DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2016.04.1122doi7 aPMC49077962pmcid7 a271355752pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSanchez, Tiffany R.10aProvision of well-water treatment units to 600 households in Bangladesh: A longitudinal analysis of urinary arsenic indicates fading utility  ap. 131-137.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aMillions of villagers in Bangladesh remain exposed to high levels of arsenic (As) from drinking untreated well-water even though the scale of the problem was recognized 15years ago. Water treatment at the household-level has been promoted as a viable complement but few longitudinal studies of their efficacy using an objective measure of exposure have been conducted. Participants (N=622) of a nutrition trial in Araihazar, Bangladesh were each provided with READ-F filters at the beginning of the study and encouraged to use them over the 6month duration of the intervention. Well-water As, treated water As, and urinary As were monitored periodically during the trial and measured again one year after the trial ended.The READ-F filters were initially well received and median urinary As levels for participants declined from 117Œºg/L to 51Œºg/L within a single week. However, median urinary As levels gradually rose back to 126Œºg/L by the end of the trial. Fifty filters were replaced over the course of the trial because of insufficient As removal or reduced flow. With these exceptions, most of the treated water met the WHO guideline for As in drinking water of 10Œºg/L. One year after the nutritional trial ended, 95% of participants had abandoned their filter citing inconvenience as the primary reason. At that time, median urinary As levels for 10 participants who had switched to a nearby low-As well had declined to 63Œºg/L.Participants were probably no longer using the READ-F filter long before the 6month nutritional intervention ended despite claiming that they were using them. Household-level treatment is likely to continue to play a minor role in the effort to reduce As exposure in Bangladesh. Understanding the limitations of such expensive interventions is important for future policy regarding As mitigation.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aWorld Health Organization 3aarsenic 3adrinking 3adrinking water 3afilters 3aguidelines 3ahouseholds 3aissues and policy 3alongitudinal studies 3anutrition 3anutritional intervention 3awater treatment 3aBangladesh 0aArsenic 0aGroundwater 0aTreatment 0aBiomarker 0aLongitudinal study 0aWater filters1 aLevy, Diane1 aShahriar, Mohammad Hasan1 aUddin, Mohammad Nasir1 aSiddique, Abu B.1 aGraziano, Joseph H.1 aLomax-Luu, Angela1 avan Geen, Alexander1 aGamble, Mary V.0 tScience of the total environment.g2016 Sept. 01, v. 563-564 p.131-137dElsevier B.V.x0048-96977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2016.04.1123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02268naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245010000158300002000258520114000278592002801418650001801446650001701464650001301481650001901494650001901513650001901532650002501551650002701576650002001603650001501623650001301638700001201651700002401663773012401687856007401811852000901885655001201894IND60641622120221120202138.0190505e20170419xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064162212DNAL7 a10.1039/c7ra02764h2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNamvari, Mina10aGraphene oxide-based silsesquioxane-crosslinked networks ‚Äì synthesis and rheological behavior  ap. 21531-21540.  aClick reaction between octa(3-azidopropyl)polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane (POSS‚Äì(N‚ÇÉ)‚Çà) and heavily alkyne-decorated graphene oxide (GO) has led to crosslinking POSS with GO.

This paper reports the utilization of waste tires (hard-to-dispose waste) as a precursor in the production of activated carbons (pollution-cleaning adsorbent). In the preparation of activated carbon (AC), waste rubber tire (WRT) was thermally treated and activated. The tire-derived activated carbon was characterized by means of scanning electron microscope, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, FTIR spectrophotometer, and X-ray diffraction. In the IR spectrum, a number of bands centred at about 3409, 2350, 1710, 1650, and 1300‚Äì1000¬†cm‚Åª¬π prove the present of hydroxyl and carboxyl groups on the surface of AC in addition to C‚ïêC double bonds. The developed AC was tested and evaluated as potential adsorbent removal of chromium (III). Experimental parameters, such as contact time, initial concentration, adsorbent dosage and pH were optimized. A rapid uptake of chromium ions was observed and the equilibrium is achieved in 1¬†h. It was also found that the adsorption process is pH dependent. This work adds to the global discussion of the cost-effective utilization of waste rubber tires for waste water treatment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3aactivated carbon 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3achromium 3acost effectiveness 3aenergy-dispersive X-ray analysis 3apH 3apollution 3aresearch 3arubber 3aspectrophotometers 3awastes 3awastewater treatment1 aAli, Imran1 aSaleh, Tawfik A.1 aSiddiqui, M.

However, its immunomodulatory function remains largely unexplored. Thus, we explored the potential link between Maspin and macrophage function, first evaluating the regulatory effects of conditioned medium (CM) of a Maspin-overexpressing CHO cell strain on mouse peritoneal macrophage phagocytosis and cytokine secretion. Next, we used a transwell co-culture system and recombinant Maspin (rMaspin) to confirm the effects of Maspin on macrophages, and attempted to clarify the underlying mechanisms. We found that irrespective of CM, rMaspin or co-culture of Maspin-overexpressing cells with macrophages impaired macrophages phagocytosing Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Furthermore, q-RT-PCR or ELISA confirmed increased IL-1Œ≤, TNF-Œ±, IFN-Œ≥, IL-6, IL-12, IL-10, and M1 marker iNOS production in macrophages after Maspin stimulation, but TGF-Œ≤ and M2 marker Arg-1 production were suppressed. Western blot showed activated NF-Œ∫B signaling in Maspin-stimulated macrophages; upregulated cytokines were lowered, and impaired phagocytosis recovered after blocking NF-Œ∫B signaling with PDTC. Thus, Maspin mildly inhibited phagocytic activity, but markedly enhanced inflammatory cytokine production and likely skewed macrophages towards M1 polarization, partially due to activation of NF-Œ∫B signaling. These results reveal a novel biological function of Maspin in modulating macrophage activity and may open a new avenue for Maspin-based tumor therapy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aimmunomodulation 3asecretion 3ainterferon-gamma 3aWestern blotting 3aphagocytosis 3ainterleukin-12 3aneoplasms 3acoculture 3amacrophages 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3atransforming growth factor beta 3ainterleukin-10 3aapoptosis 3atranscription factor NF-kappa B 3aserine proteinases 3amice 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha 3ainterleukin-1beta 3ainterleukin-6 3atherapeutics 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3ainducible nitric oxide synthase 3aproteinase inhibitors 3aangiogenesis 0aPhagocytosis 0aNBS 0aIŒ∫B 0aCM 0aFITC 0aIFN 0arMaspin 0aSEM 0aTumor suppressor 0aTumor microenvironment 0aPolarization 0aiNOS 0aPDTC 0aIKK 0aArg-1 0aLPS 0aMœÜ 0aCytokine production 0acell invasion 0aGAPDH 0aMacrophage1 aSun, Luguo1 aSong, Zhenbo1 aWang, Danfeng1 aBao, Yongli1 aLi, Yuxin0 tMolecular Immunology.g2016, dElsevier Ltdx0161-58907nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.molimm.2016.12.0213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03229naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100002700166245012700193300001600320520144200336592002801778650003101806650001001837650002001847650003101867650001001898650002901908650001301937650004301950650002601993650001702019650004102036650002102077650005602098650004002154650001802194700002802212700002802240700002302268700003002291700002402321700002502345700002302370700002602393700002702419700002502446700002702471700002402498773009602522856004802618852000902666655001202675IND50068093920221121015822.0130725e201309  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006809392DNAL7 a236497432pmid7 a10.1007/s00284-013-0376-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPe√±uelas-Urquides, K.10aComparison of Gene Expression Profiles Between Pansensitive and Multidrug-Resistant Strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis   ap. 362-371.  aMycobacterium tuberculosis has developed resistance to anti-tuberculosis first-line drugs. Multidrug-resistant strains complicate the control of tuberculosis and have converted it into a worldwide public health problem. Mutational studies of target genes have tried to envisage the resistance in clinical isolates; however, detection of these mutations in some cases is not sufficient to identify drug resistance, suggesting that other mechanisms are involved. Therefore, the identification of new markers of susceptibility or resistance to first-line drugs could contribute (1) to specifically diagnose the type of M. tuberculosis strain and prescribe an appropriate therapy, and (2) to elucidate the mechanisms of resistance in multidrug-resistant strains. In order to identify specific genes related to resistance in M. tuberculosis, we compared the gene expression profiles between the pansensitive H37Rv strain and a clinical CIBIN:UMF:15:99 multidrug-resistant isolate using microarray analysis. Quantitative real-time PCR confirmed that in the clinical multidrug-resistant isolate, the esxG, esxH, rpsA, esxI, and rpmI genes were upregulated, while the lipF, groES, and narG genes were downregulated. The modified genes could be involved in the mechanisms of resistance to first-line drugs in M. tuberculosis and could contribute to increased efficiency in molecular diagnosis approaches of infections with drug-resistant strains.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMycobacterium tuberculosis 3adrugs 3agene expression 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3amultiple drug resistance 3amutation 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3aresistance mechanisms 3atuberculosis 2aDrug Resistance, Multiple, Bacterial 2aGenes, Bacterial 2aMycobacterium tuberculosisxdrug effectsxgenetics. 2aReal-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction 2aTranscriptome1 aGonz√°lez-Escalante, L.1 aVillarreal-Trevi√±o, L.1 aSilva-Ram√≠rez, B.1 aGuti√©rrez-Fuentes, D.

Despite its relevance, little emphasis was previously given on verifying approaches to calculate contributions of individual emissions to ozone and hence to climate change. Basically two methods (perturbation method and tagging method) were used in the past. We demonstrate that both methods are valid and have their area of application, but only tagging calculates contributions of emissions to concentrations, whereas the perturbation method identifies changes in the ozone concentrations due to emission changes. Our results show that the contribution of road traffic emissions to climate change is underestimated by a factor of 5 in the perturbation method. This is caused by non-linear compensating effects from other emission sectors, which are concealed in the perturbation method but disclosed with tagging. Consequently, the effectiveness of mitigation measures for individual sectors (i.e. concentrating on road traffic induced ozone) is only correctly expressed by the tagging method. The perturbation method provides accurately the total impact (i.e. total ozone) of a mitigation measure. However, current approaches, which evaluate the effectiveness of a mitigation measure based on the perturbation approach, do not reflect changes in the chemical state of the atmosphere (i.e. ozone production rates). These largely affect the effectiveness of subsequent measures and hence make the evaluation of the effectiveness of two measures dependent on their chronology of application. We show that also in this regard, the tagging method is better suited to evaluate the effectiveness of a mitigation measure than the perturbation method.  aPublisher supplied data 3aatmospheric chemistry 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3aemissions 3agreenhouse gases 3anitrogen oxides 3aozone 3atraffic1 aDahlmann, Katrin1 aMatthes, Sigrun1 aSteinbrecht, Wolfgang0 tAtmospheric environment.g2012 Nov., v. 59 p.102-107dElsevier Ltdx1352-23107nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.atmosenv.2012.05.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02636naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100005800149245010000207300001400307520122500321592002801546650002201574650002801596650001601624650002501640650002501665650001801690650002001708650002501728650002201753650001801775650001901793653001901812653001201831653001701843653001601860653001101876653001601887700002301903700001601926700002301942773012001965856008402085852000902169655001202178IND60541086520221122140936.0190318e201405  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054108652DNAL7 a10.1016/j.still.2013.12.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZheng, Baojuan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0056-178610aRemote sensing of crop residue and tillage practices: Present capabilities and future prospects  ap. 26-34.  aSustainable agricultural management is essential not only to maintain productivity of current farmlands, but also to conserve natural environments. Records of agricultural activities are required to assist rapid assessment of agricultural lands, and thus, designation of management plans and policies. By the 1980s, when unfavorable environmental impacts of conventional tillage practices were widely recognized, agronomists introduced conservation tillage to benefit soils and agricultural environments, and soon began programs to monitor adoption of conservation tillage practices. The role of remote sensing in acquiring this information has been increasing because remote sensing technologies can provide the broad scope and the ability to collect sequential imagery to estimate trends and patterns of adoption of alternative tillage practices. This review encompasses comparisons of remote sensing techniques with more conventional methods for surveying and estimating tillage status, applications of remote sensing technologies, data processing and analysis, validation and field data collection, impacts of terrain, spectral and spatial resolution, timing and temporal detail, and prospects of future instruments.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural land 3aagricultural management 3aagronomists 3aconservation tillage 3aconventional tillage 3acrop residues 3adata collection 3aenvironmental impact 3aissues and policy 3arapid methods 3aremote sensing 0aRemote sensing 0aTillage 0aCrop residue 0aAgriculture 0aReview 0aEnvironment1 aCampbell, James B.1 aSerbin, Guy1 aGalbraith, John M.0 tSoil & tillage research.g2014 May, v. 138 p.26-34dElsevier B.V.aElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl32961x0167-19877nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.still.2013.12.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02046naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245007800167300002000245520099200265592002801257650001701285650001501302650002401317700001701341700002201358700002401380700006201404700005701466773011601523856008401639852000901723655001201732IND60626185320221120172304.0181218e20181123xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062618532DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.langmuir.8b033962doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOgata, Yudai10aImpact of the Solid Interface on Proton Conductivity in Nafion Thin Films  ap. 15483-15489.  aProton conductivity of polyelectrolytes in the interfacial region with a solid is key to the performance of polyelectrolyte-based fuel cells. The proton conductivity of Nafion thin films was examined as a function of the thickness along both directions, normal and parallel to the interface. Neutron reflectivity measurements revealed that a water-containing multilamellar structure was formed at the substrate interface. The presence of the interfacial layer, or the two-dimensional proton-conductive pathway, suppressed and enhanced the out-of-plane and in-plane proton conductivities, respectively. The method of proton conductivity in the interfacial region differed from that in the bulk, namely, the Grotthuss mechanism. Using laminated films, we conclude by showing that the proton conductivity in the Nafion thin film changes on the basis of the interface-to-volume ratio. This knowledge will be helpful for the design of devices containing polyelectrolytes with solid materials.  aPublisher supplied data 3aelectrolytes 3afuel cells 3aneutron diffraction1 aAbe, Tatsuki1 aYonemori, Shigeki1 aYamada, Norifumi L.1 aKawaguchi, Daisuke1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8930-039X1 aTanaka, Keiji1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0314-38430 tLangmuir.g2018 Nov. 23, v. 34, no. 50 p.15483-15489dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19170x1520-58277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.langmuir.8b033963Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02544naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002300145245013300168300001800301520116500319592002801484650001501512650001701527650002201544650001501566650002601581650001501607650001901622650006601641650001301707650001301720650002501733650002801758700001901786700002301805700002201828700002001850700001901870700002101889700002201910773010901932856004802041852000902089655001202098IND4515904420221123002602.0151006e201112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND451590442DNAL7 a10.1134/S10619348111401392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPyatnitskiy, M.

The profiling was performed by automated sample preparation followed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. The training set comprised of 152 blood plasma samples from patients with squamous cell lung cancer and 185 ones of the control group. For processing the profiles, the method of support vector machines was used in the environment of the ClinProTools 2.0 software and freely accessible language R for statistical analysis. The original software created in R-environment was shown to provide with more plentiful opportunities in the search for potential biomarkers, i.e., mass spectral peaks, in comparison to the ClinProTools 2.0 software. As a result of study, a number of 15 mass spectral peaks was established, which discriminated blood plasma samples collected from patients with squamous cell lung cancer and those of the control group. The selection of mass spectral peaks may potentially serve for the early diagnostics of the disease.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiomarkers 3ablood plasma 3acomputer software 3adesorption 3adiagnostic techniques 3aionization 3alung neoplasms 3amatrix-assisted laser desorption-ionization mass spectrometry 3apatients 3aproteome 3astatistical analysis 3asupport vector machines1 aLisitsa, A.

In this study, drop the sweet cherry fruits at the height of 50¬†cm in the hypothetical situation, causing some possible mechanical damages, then soak the damaged sweet cherries in 0.15¬†mM methyl jasmonate (MeJA) and 0.5¬†mM salicylic acid (SA) for 10¬†min, respectively. The results showed that MeJA and SA treatment effectively ameliorated the mechanical injury of sweet cherries, as well as inhibited the increase of weight loss, the decrease of firmness and the accumulation of active oxygen species. Meanwhile, the increase of membrane lipid degradation-related enzyme activity was also inhibited. What's more, MeJA and SA maintained high levels of antioxidant contents, antioxidant enzyme activity, and higher capability of phenylpropanoid metabolism. Thus, MeJA and SA have the potential ability to maintain the quality of sweet cherries and reduce the loss caused by mechanical damages after the postharvest.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPrunus avium 3aactive oxygen species 3aantioxidant enzymes 3aenzyme activity 3afirmness 3alipids 3ametabolism 3amethyl jasmonate 3asalicylic acid 3atransportation 3aweight loss 0aSweet cherry 0aMechanical damages 0aAntioxidant capacities 0aPhenylpropanoid metabolism1 aXu, Dongying1 aZhou, Fuhui1 aFeng, Ke1 aChen, Chen1 aJiang, Aili0 tScientia horticulturae.g2022 Jan. 27, v. 292 p.110567-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4108x0304-42387nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scienta.2021.1105673Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02249naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001500147245010400162300001600266520098100282592002801263650002201291650001101313650002201324650001101346650002101357650001501378650002401393650001601417650001201433650002001445650002201465650001401487650001801501650001401519650001301533650002001546700001701566700001501583700001601598773009901614856008101713852000901794655001201803IND60085723720221119033330.0141101e20111010xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008572372DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aca.2011.07.0392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Aihua12aA three-dimensional hierarchical nanoporous PdCu alloy for enhanced electrocatalysis and biosensing  ap. 172-178.  aNanoporous copper (NPC) obtained by dealloying CuAl alloy is used as both three-dimensional template and reducing agent for the fabrication of nanoporous PdCu alloy with hollow ligaments by a simple galvanic replacement reaction with H‚ÇÇPdCl‚ÇÑ aqueous solution.

For this aim lactate oxidase-Prussian Blue enzyme-nanozyme type lactate biosensors were elaborated. The use of siloxane-perfluorosulfonated ionomer composite membrane for enzyme-nanozyme immobilization results in the biosensor displaying flux independence in the whole range of physiological sweat secretion rates (0.025‚Äì2¬†Œºl¬†cm‚Åª¬≤ min‚Åª¬π). On the contrary, current response of the biosensor based on solely siloxane membranes becomes saturated at physiological sweat lactate concentration, depending mostly on the flow rate. Accordingly, for simultaneous monitoring of sweat lactate concentration and its secretion rate both flow-through biosensors were integrated with high-accuracy wearable electronic devices allowing real-time remote monitoring. As found, during exhaustive physical exercise sweat secretion rate and lactate content are independent of each other, thus, confirming that this excretory liquid is suitable for non-invasive diagnostics.  aPublisher supplied data 3aasymmetric membranes 3abiosensors 3adiagnostic techniques 3aexercise 3alactic acid 3aliquids 3asecretion 3asweat 0aSweating rate 0aFlow-sensitive sensor 0aNanozyme 0a‚ÄòArtificial peroxidase‚Äô 0aPrussian Blue 0aNon-invasive diagnostics1 aEliseev, Artem A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3644-96731 aPoyarkov, Andrei A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1774-85711 aDaboss, Elena V.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5193-21961 aEvdokimov, Pavel V.1 aEliseev, Andrei A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2851-68211 aKaryakin, Arkady A.0 tBiosensors & bioelectronics.g2022 Apr. 15, v. 202 p.113970-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11631x0956-56637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bios.2022.1139703Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02956naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245009900167300001800266500001500284520127000299592002801569650002101597650002601618650001301644650001001657650001801667650001801685650001001703650001201713650001201725650001401737650001001751650001601761650002901777650002101806650002001827650001801847650003101865650002101896650001601917651001601933653002201949653001501971653002101986653001602007653002202023653001002045700001802055700001802073700002102091700002502112700002002137773010302157856008502260852000902345655001202354IND60566122620221122210648.0170401e20170503xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056612262DNAL7 a10.1080/09593330.2016.12396572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCho, Won-Mo10aNutrient status and phytotoxicity analysis of goat manure discharged from farms in South Korea  ap. 1191-1199.  a2019-12-06  aThe present study evaluated the phytotoxicity effect of goat manure (GM) collected from six different regions in South Korea, namely, Chupungnyeong (T1), Hoengseong (T2), Goesan (T3), Sancheong (T4), Jangsu (T5) and Namwon (T6). Phytotoxicity was assessed by means of the analysis of germination index (GI), relative seed germination (RSG), relative root elongation (RRE) and vigor index (VI) using five commercial crop varieties, namely, sesame (Sesamum indicum L .), chrysanthemum (Chrysanthemum indicum L.), carrot (Daucus carota), radish (Raphanus sativus) and cabbage (Brassica rapa). Physico-chemical parameter values were recorded at appreciable levels in all GM extracts. The effect of seedling growth was significantly different (p ‚â§‚Äâ.05) due to the variability of nutrient content and phytotoxic effect of the extracts on the different crop seeds. Of the extracts, Goesan (T3) and Sancheong (T4) recorded the best results in the range of GI (%) (54.1‚Äì128.8) and VI (930.7‚Äì1044) and GI (%) (70.1‚Äì167.3) and VI (609.2‚Äì3034), respectively, and also showed no inhibitory effect in any of the crop seeds.

Currently, it is a challenge to create a profitable recycling process, which is made more difficult by the reduction in cathode cobalt content. Maintenance of the cathode structure throughout the recycling process can yield increased revenues that may make recycling profitable. This method will require careful removal of the PVDF binder and carbon black, which can be achieved through thermal processing. It is necessary to mitigate the effects of the fluorine from the PVDF on the cathode material. Herein, we report a process that utilizes excess LiOH¬∑H‚ÇÇO to react with this fluorine and thereby prevent lithium removal and doping of the cathode material. In addition, we demonstrate a one-step thermal process that can both remove the binder and relithiate the cathode material.  aPublisher supplied data 3acathodes 3acobalt 3aelectric vehicles 3afluorine 3aheat treatment 3aincome 3alithium 3alithium batteries 3arecycling 3asoot 3athermoplastics 0aLi-ion battery 0aDirect recycling 0aRelithiation 0aBinder removal 0aThermal processing1 aLeResche, Michael1 aLiu, Donghao1 aDurham, Jessica L.1 aDahl, Erik U.1 aLipson, Albert L.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0624-612X0 tACS sustainable chemistry & engineering.g2020 July 28, v. 8, no. 33 p.12511-12515dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23317x2168-04857nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acssuschemeng.0c034243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02533naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002400151245013700175300001400312520122200326592002801548650001101576650002101587650001001608650001801618650001201636650000701648650001801655650001401673650001401687653001201701653002901713653001701742653000901759653000701768700004001775700003001815700003101845700002201876773010601898856008602004852000902090655001202099IND50065409220221118082037.0190319e201308  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006540922DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodhyd.2013.02.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMartinez, Mar√≠a J.10aFoaming and surface properties of casein glycomacropeptide‚Äìgelatin mixtures as affected by their interactions in the aqueous phase  ap. 48-57.  aGelatin is widely used in food industry for the stabilization of foam products. On the other hand, casein glycomacropeptide (CMP) is a bioactive peptide with high surface activity. The aim of this work was to study the interfacial and foaming properties of CMP‚Äìgelatin mixed systems at pH 6.5 and 3.5 and evaluate the relation of these properties with the interactions in the aqueous phase. The CMP:gelatin ratio in mixed systems was 0:100 (pure gelatin), 25:75, 50:50, 75:25 and 100:0 (pure CMP). Viscosity, particle size, Œ∂-potential, interfacial properties and foaming properties were determined. At both pH, gelatin solutions showed the highest viscosity, CMP the lowest and the mixed systems presented behaviour more similar than CMP. Particle size and Œ∂-potential determinations evidenced the formation of complexes between CMP and gelatin at both pH. CMP was more surface active than gelatin and dominated the rate of diffusion of the mixed systems to the air‚Äìwater interface. A synergistic effect was observed on foamability and foam stability in mixed systems that could be explained by the formation of a complex between CMP and gelatin with outstanding capacity for foams formation and stabilization.  aPublisher supplied data 3acasein 3afoaming capacity 3afoams 3afood industry 3agelatin 3apH 3aparticle size 3asynergism 3aviscosity 0aGelatin 0aCasein glycomacropeptide 0aInteractions 0aFoam 0apH1 aPizones Ruiz-Henestrosa, V√≠ctor M.1 aCarrera S√°nchez, Cecilio1 aRodr√≠guez Patino, Juan M.1 aPilosof, Ana M.R.0 tFood hydrocolloids.g2013 Aug., v. 33, no. 1 p.48-57dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46643x0268-005X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodhyd.2013.02.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03024naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002200144245009400166300002000260500001900280520147000299592002801769650002101797650004401818650001201862650000901874650001101883650002901894650002801923650001001951650004801961650002802009650001302037650002002050653002002070653003102090653001902121653001502140700002402155700002302179700002102202700002502223700006502248773014202313856007802455852000902533655001202542IND60731144320210831000000.0210317e20210302xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073114432DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.0c217232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMart√≠nez, Sol R.10aSelf-Sterilizing 3D-Printed Polylactic Acid Surfaces Coated with a BODIPY Photosensitizer  ap. 11597-11608.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aHerein, we report the use of polylactic acid coated with a halogenated BODIPY photosensitizer (PS) as a novel self-sterilizing, low-cost, and eco-friendly material activated with visible light. In this article, polymeric surfaces were 3D-printed and treated with the PS using three simple methodologies: spin coating, aerosolization, and brush dispersion. Our studies showed that the polymeric matrix remains unaffected upon addition of the PS, as observed by dynamic mechanical analysis, Fourier transform infrared, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and fluorescence microscopy. Furthermore, the photophysical and photodynamic properties of the dye remained intact after being adsorbed on the polymer. This photoactive material can be reused and was successfully inactivating methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli in planktonic media for at least three inactivation cycles after short-time light exposure. A real-time experiment using a fluorescence microscope showed how bacteria anchored to the antimicrobial surface were inactivated within 30 min using visible light and low energy. Moreover, the material effectively eradicated these two bacterial strains on the first stage of biofilm formation, as elucidated by SEM. Unlike other antimicrobial approaches that implement a dissolved PS or non-sustainable materials, we offer an accessible green and economic alternative to acquire self-sterilizing surfaces with any desired shape.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3abiofilm 3adyes 3aenergy 3afluorescence microscopes 3afluorescence microscopy 3alight 3amethicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus 3aphotosensitizing agents 3aplankton 3apolylactic acid 0aphotosensitizer 0aself-sterilizing materials 0aantimicrobials 0asanitizing1 aPalacios, Yohana B.1 aHeredia, Daniel A.1 aAiassa, Virginia1 aBartolilla, Antonela1 aDurantini, Andr√©s M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7898-40330 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2021 Mar. 02, v. 13, no. 10 p.11597-11608dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.0c217233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03276naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245008000168300001600248520152800264592002801792650001901820650002001839650001201859650002601871650002201897650002201919650001601941650000901957650001801966650001301984650001501997650001002012650001402022650001502036650001402051650001002065650001502075650001202090650001202102650001202114651002502126651001302151651001002164653001402174653002002188653002002208653002802228653001502256653003002271653001302301653001502314653001902329700002002348700001902368700001702387700001802404773011302422856008202535852000902617655001202626IND60601345320221118224825.0210911e201409  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060134532DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jas.2014.06.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLloveras, Llu√≠s10aUnderstanding the taphonomic signature of Bonelli's Eagle (Aquila fasciata)  ap. 455-471.  aBonelli's eagle (Aquila fasciata) is a large bird of prey that breeds in warm regions of the Palearctic. In Europe, it is mainly found in the Mediterranean region, in open or partially-open landscapes in mountainous areas. They normally feed on mammals, up to the size of a hare, medium-sized birds and large reptiles.The remains of Bonelli's eagles have been found at Pleistocene archaeological sites, raising the possibility that they were active bone accumulating agents in caves and shelters, a practice evidenced by contemporary studies that show their nests are usually located on rocky cliffs.Taphonomic studies on prey remains consumed by these raptors do not exist and their role in bone accumulations at archaeological sites is not understood. We analyse non-ingested bone remains and pellets recovered at well-known Bonelli's eagle nests situated in the south of Spain and Portugal with the aim of characterising their accumulations. Specifically, we detail taxonomic and anatomical representation, bone breakage, beak marks and digestion damage. Results show that European wild rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus), red-legged partridge (Alectoris rufa) and pigeons (Columba spp.) are the dominant prey. The taphonomic pattern varies depending on the type of prey and the origin of skeletal materials (non-ingested versus pellets). Comparisons with other agents of bone accumulation (birds of prey and terrestrial carnivores) suggest that the taphonomic signature of Bonelli's eagle differs from most other predators.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAlectoris rufa 3aAquila fasciata 3aColumba 3aOryctolagus cuniculus 3aPalearctic region 3aPleistocene epoch 3aarchaeology 3abeak 3abirds of prey 3abreeding 3acarnivores 3acaves 3adigestion 3alandscapes 3amountains 3anests 3apartridges 3apellets 3apigeons 3arabbits 3aMediterranean region 3aPortugal 3aSpain 0aTaphonomy 0aBonelli's eagle 0aAquila fasciata 0aBone accumulator agents 0aSmall prey 0aAnatomical representation 0aBreakage 0aBeak marks 0aDigested bones1 aThomas, Richard1 aLouren√ßo, Rui1 aCaro, Jes√∫s1 aDias, Andreia0 tJournal of archaeological science.g2014 Sept., v. 49 p.455-471dElsevier LtdwJournal:3403x0305-44037nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jas.2014.06.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02163naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245006400172300002000236520080300256592002801059650002401087650001301111650002201124650000901146650001901155650002601174650001401200650001201214650001501226650001501241650001301256653000801269653001501277653001301292653001101305653002101316653001001337700002001347700003301367700006501400773014601465856008501611852000901696655001201705IND60708353220200924000000.0200824e20200730xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070835322DNAL7 a10.1021/acssuschemeng.0c034782doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLongeras, Olympe10aDeep Eutectic Solvent with Thermo-Switchable Hydrophobicity  ap. 12516-12520.  aA deep eutectic solvent (DES) that becomes hydrophobic upon increasing the temperature is presented for the first time. The aqueous solution of this DES composed of lidocaine, an amphiphilic amine, and oleic acid forms a single transparent liquid phase at ambient temperature. A small increase in temperature triggers an abrupt phase separation while the solvent crosses the lower critical solution temperature (LCST). Considering that both ammonium and oleate ions are more soluble in water than their neutral form, the abrupt separation is induced by a decrease of the ionicity. An IR spectroscopy study established a correlation between the phase separation and the decrease of the concentration of ions. In addition, this DES has the ability to extract several dyes from water very efficiently.  aPublisher supplied data 3aambient temperature 3aammonium 3aaqueous solutions 3adyes 3ahydrophobicity 3ainfrared spectroscopy 3alidocaine 3aliquids 3aoleic acid 3aseparation 3asolvents 0adye 0aextraction 0aionicity 0aoleate 0aphase separation 0awater1 aGautier, Arnaud1 aBallerat-Busserolles, Karine1 aAndanson, Jean-Michel1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1610-93130 tACS sustainable chemistry & engineering.g2020 July 30, v. 8, no. 33 p.12516-12520dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23317x2168-04857nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acssuschemeng.0c034783Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03125naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245008600172300001600258500001500274520183000289592002802119650001102147650002002158650001802178650001402196650001302210650002202223650001202245650002302257650001302280650002502293650001102318651001502329653001702344653001402361653001702375653001902392653001402411653002102425700002702446773010002473856008502573852000902658655001202667IND60566122820221122224353.0170401e20170603xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056612282DNAL7 a10.1080/10106049.2016.11610802doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBurnham, Jahnavi10aFactors explaining the dispersal of Hendra virus disease in South-East Queensland  ap. 603-618.  a2019-12-06  aHendra virus (HeV) was first described in 1994 following the outbreak of a new disease fatally affecting horses and humans in South-east Queensland. The disease kills 70% of the infected horses and under some circumstances the virus is spread to humans who have had close contact with the infected horses. Fruit bats (Pteropus spp.) commonly known as flying foxes have been identified as the natural host of the virus. A preliminary analysis of the incidents and the flying fox roosting sites revealed a strong relationship between the temporary and seasonal roosting sites in the South-east Queensland. The aim of this paper is to determine the potential factors that can explain the dispersal of HeV incidents in the study area. Based on the preliminary results, a further analysis was done on the roosting sites by considering factors such as the species of flying foxes, foraging range and pregnancy period. Spatial autocorrelation (Global Moran‚Äôs I) revealed significant clustering of P. alecto and P. scapulatus species. Kernel density estimation analysis helped in identifying a strong relationship between P. alecto & P. scapulatus species density and the outbreak events in the study area. Buffer analysis established an initial relationship between P. alecto & P. poliocephalus species birth periods and the incidents. Ordinary least-squares regression identified P. poliocephalus species as statistically significant at a global context across the study area. Geographically weighted regression analysis was performed to study the local spatial variations of the explanatory variables. P. alecto & P. poliocephalus species exhibited a significant positive relationship in most of the regions where as pregnancy period variable exhibited a significant negative relationship to the HeV incidents in the study area.  aPublisher supplied data 3ahumans 3aautocorrelation 3aleast squares 3apregnancy 3aPteropus 3aroosting behavior 3aviruses 3aHendra henipavirus 3aforaging 3aHendra virus disease 3ahorses 3aQueensland 0aflying foxes 0aincidents 0aHendra virus 0aHendra disease 0adispersal 0aspatial analysis1 aChong, Albert Kon-Fook0 tGeocarto international.g2017 June 3, v. 32, no. 6 p.603-618dTaylor & Francisx1752-07627nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10106049.2016.11610803Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04345naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002000149245018200169300001200351520240500363592002802768650001702796650001902813650003502832650002002867650002202887650002602909650001802935650001702953650002402970650001502994650002503009650001603034650001803050650001503068650001103083650001703094650002603111650002203137650002003159650001203179650001303191650001503204650000903219650001103228650002103239650001103260650002003271651001003291653004303301653002803344653001703372653001003389700002403399700006303423700002403486773010403510856008403614852000903698655001203707IND60541086920221122140952.0190318e201406  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054108692DNAL7 a10.1016/j.still.2014.01.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCampiglia, Enio10aLong-term residual effects of the management of cover crop biomass on soil nitrogen and yield of endive (Cichorium endivia L.) and savoy cabbage (Brassica oleracea var. sabauda)  ap. 1-7.  aThere is a lack of information regarding the long-term residual effects of winter cover crops on the following cash crops. Two 2-year field experiments (from 2009 to 2012) were carried out in the Mediterranean environment of Central Italy in a Typic Xerofluvent soil. Endive (Cichorium endivia L.) and savoy cabbage (Brassica oleracea var. sabauda) were grown following a winter cover crop-pepper (Capsicum annum L.) sequence. We hypothesized that some cover crops and their residue management can have a long-term effect on the availability of soil nitrogen. The objectives were to quantify the: (i) nitrogen remaining in the soil and in the residues of cover crops after pepper cultivation; (ii) endive and savoy cabbage response due to the residual effect of cover crop residues, and (iii) mass of inorganic nitrogen required for obtaining a similar effect to that obtained with the residues of cover crops. The treatments consisted in three cover crop species [hairy vetch (Vicia villosa Roth.), oat (Avena sativa L.) and oilseed rape (Brassica napus L.)], three managements of the aboveground biomass of cover crops [incorporated into the soil 30cm depth (conventional tillage, CT), incorporated into the soil 10cm depth (minimum tillage, MT), left on the soil surface in mulch strips (no-tillage, NT)] plus a control without cover (no cover) fertilized with three levels of nitrogen (none, medium, high). At transplant of vegetables, the nitrogen in the cover crop residues ranged from 60kgha‚àí1 in hairy vetch NT to 9kgha‚àí1 in oilseed rape CT, while the soil inorganic nitrogen (NO3-N+NH4-N) was about twice in hairy vetch (20.9+7.4mgkg‚àí1 dry soil, respectively) compared with oat and 1.5 times compared with oilseed rape. The marketable yield of endive and savoy cabbage was approximately tripled in hairy vetch compared to oat, oilseed rape and the unfertilized control (20.4 and 18.6 vs. 6.7 and 5.2tha‚àí1 of FM, respectively). The endive and savoy cabbage yield was higher in NT and MT than in CT hairy vetch and similar to no cover fertilized with 50 and 75kgha‚àí1 of N, respectively. Results confirm the hypothesis that some cover crops, such as hairy vetch, can have a long-term effect on the availability of soil nitrogen which exceeds the cultivation period of the following summer vegetable crop and can be profitably used by a second cash crop transplanted in close sequence.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAvena sativa 3aBrassica napus 3aBrassica oleracea var. sabauda 3aCapsicum annuum 3aCichorium endivia 3aMediterranean climate 3aVicia villosa 3aXerofluvents 3aaboveground biomass 3acash crops 3aconventional tillage 3acover crops 3acrop residues 3acrop yield 3aendive 3aenergy crops 3afield experimentation 3along term effects 3aminimum tillage 3amulches 3anitrogen 3ano-tillage 3aoats 3apepper 3aresidual effects 3asummer 3avegetable crops 3aItaly 0aSustainable vegetable cropping systems 0aResidual soil fertility 0aGreen manure 0aMulch1 aMancinelli, Roberto1 aDi Felice, Vincenzo1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4203-59841 aRadicetti, Emanuele0 tSoil & tillage research.g2014 June, v. 139 p.1-7dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl32961x0167-19877nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.still.2014.01.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03165naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100003100147245011400178300001600292500001500308520169500323592002802018650001602046650001102062650002202073650002102095650001402116650001402130650001302144650001102157650001802168650003702186650001902223650001902242650003302261650003202294650002002326650001902346650001502365650004102380653002102421700002702442700002302469773010102492856008102593852000902674655001202683IND60085724120221119033530.0141101e20111017xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008572412DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aca.2011.07.0452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGholivand, Mohammad Bagher10aPolypyrrole/hexagonally ordered silica nanocomposite as a novel fiber coating for solid-phase microextraction  ap. 174-179.  a2019-12-06  aA highly porous fiber coated polypyrrole/hexagonally ordered silica (PPy/SBA15) materials were prepared for solid-phase microextraction (SPME). The PPy/SBA15 nanocomposite was synthesized by an in situ polymerization technique. The resulting material was characterized by the scanning electron microscopy, thermogravimetric analysis and differential thermal analysis. The prepared nanomaterial was immobilized onto a stainless steel wire for fabrication of the SPME fiber. The fiber was evaluated for the extraction of some polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) from aqueous sample solutions in combination with gas chromatography‚Äìmass spectrometry (GC‚ÄìMS). A one at-the-time optimization strategy was applied for optimizing the important extraction parameters such as extraction temperature, extraction time, ionic strength, stirring rate, desorption time and desorption temperature. In optimum conditions (extraction temperature 70¬∞C, extraction time 20min, ionic strength 20% (WV‚Åª¬π), stirring rate 500rpm, desorption temperature 270¬∞C, desorption time 5min) the repeatability for one fiber (n=3), expressed as relative standard deviation (R.S.D. %), was between 5.0% and 9.3% for the tested compounds. The quantitation limit for the studied compounds were between 13.3 and 66.6pgmL‚Åª¬π. The life span and stability of the PPy/SBA15 fiber are good, and it can be used more than 50 times at 260¬∞C without any significant change in sorption properties. The developed method offers the advantage of being simple to use, with shorter analysis times, lower cost of equipment, thermal stability of fiber and high relative recovery in comparison to conventional methods of analysis.  aPublisher supplied data 3atemperature 3asilica 3athermal stability 3athermogravimetry 3alongevity 3aequipment 3acoatings 3amixing 3ananomaterials 3apolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 3apolymerization 3ananocomposites 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asolid phase microextraction 3astainless steel 3aionic strength 3adesorption 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 0athermal analysis1 aAbolghasemi, Mir Mahdi1 aFattahpour, Peyman0 tAnalytica chimica acta.g2011 Oct. 17, v. 704, no. 1-2 p.174-179dElsevier B.V.x0003-26707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aca.2011.07.0453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03076naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100002000166245007300186300001800259500001500277520165200292592002801944650001001972650001201982650001101994650000902005650002202014650002502036650000902061650001102070650001602081650001202097650001102109650004602120650004902166650000902215650002602224650001002250650002902260650001702289650002802306653001602334700001802350700001602368700001702384773010002401856004802501852000902549655001202558IND50068527020221120105351.0130814e201309  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006852702DNAL7 a238281922pmid7 a10.1007/s00436-013-3511-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLeonardi, M.

Vertical transmission is fundamental for the long-term stability of A. microchir populations because only pups stay long enough (1¬†month) on land for the louse to reproduce. A total of 72 pups ‚â§7¬†days old from a single rookery were captured and examined for lice. Infection parameters and population structure of A. microchir did not differ among pups collected at the beginning, middle, and end of the reproductive season, suggesting that patterns of early vertical transmission are not affected by the increase of rookery size during this period. Over 60¬†% of 1-day-old pups were infected with A. microchir, and recruitment increased in pups up to 3¬†days old and then leveled off. In 1-day-old pups, significantly more adults than nymphs were found, but the pattern was reversed in older pups. The number of first-stage nymphs was significantly smaller than that of second- and third-stage nymphs, as it was the number of males vs. females, particularly in 1-day-old pups. Three non-exclusive hypotheses could account for these patterns, i.e., recruitment merely reflects the population structure of A. microchir is cows; the relative ability of lice to pass from cows onto pups increases in advanced instars; and/or natural selection favors transmission of adults, especially females, because they accrue greater fitness. The importance of latter hypothesis should not be underestimated in a species with a tight reproductive schedule.  aPublisher supplied data 3amales 3ainstars 3anymphs 3acows 3anatural selection 3apopulation structure 3apups 3aadults 2aAge Factors 2aAnimals 2aFemale 2aInfectious Disease Transmission, Vertical 2aLice Infestationsxtransmissionxveterinary. 2aMale 2aMultivariate Analysis 2aNymph 2aPhthirapteraxphysiology 2aReproduction 2aSea Lionsxparasitology 0arecruitment1 aCrespo, E.

In the present study, parameters influencing micelle size were investigated to tailor sizes in the range of 25‚Äì100 nm. Micelles were prepared by a nanoprecipitation method, and their size was modulated by the block copolymer properties such as molecular weight, their hydrophilic-to-hydrophobic ratio, homopolymer content, as well as formulation and processing parameters. It was shown that the micelles have a core‚Äìshell structure using a combination of dynamic light scattering and transmission electron microscopy analysis. By varying the degree of polymerization of the hydrophobic block (NB) between 68 and 10, at a fixed hydrophilic block mPEG‚ÇÖ‚Çñ (NA = 114), it was shown that the hydrophobic core of the micelle was collapsed following the power law of (NB √ó N‚Çêgg)¬π/¬≥. Further, the calculated brush height was similar for all the micelles examined (10 nm), indicating that crew-cut micelles were made. Both addition of homopolymer and preparation of micelles at lower concentrations or lower rates of addition of the organic solvent to the aqueous phase increased the size of micelles due to partitioning of the hydrophobic homopolymer chains to the core of the micelles and lower nucleation rates, respectively. Furthermore, it was shown that by using different solvents, the size of the micelles substantially changed. The use of acetone, acetonitrile, ethanol, tetrahydrofuran, and dioxane resulted in micelles in the size range of 45‚Äì60 nm after removal of the organic solvents. The use of dimethylformamide and dimethylsulfoxide led to markedly larger sizes of 75 and 180 nm, respectively. In conclusion, the results show that by modulating polymer properties and processing conditions, micelles with tailorable sizes can be obtained.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aacetone 3aacetonitrile 3acomposite polymers 3adimethyl sulfoxide 3adimethylformamide 3adioxane 3aethanol 3ahydrophilicity 3ahydrophobicity 3alight scattering 3amicelles 3amolecular weight 3ananotechnology 3apolyethylene glycol 3apolymerization 3asolvents 3atetrahydrofuran 3atransmission electron microscopy1 aBresseleers, Jaleesa1 aVarela-Moreira, Aida1 aSandre, Olivier1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1815-27021 aMeeuwissen, Silvie A.1 aSchiffelers, Raymond M.1 aMetselaar, Josbert M.1 avan Nostrum, Cornelus F.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4210-52411 avan Hest, Jan C.

In Arabidopsis leaves, expression of the HD-ZIP III gene ATHB8 is initiated in files of isodiametric subepidermal cells that will elongate into vein-forming procambium. We have recently shown that ATHB8 is transiently required for preprocambial development and procambium differentiation, and that permanence of the effects of loss of ATHB8 function on vein formation depends on the activity of the auxin response factor MONOPTEROS (MP). Further, we have shown that the onset of ATHB8 expression is directly and positively regulated by MP through an auxin-response element in the ATHB8 promoter, suggesting a molecular path by which auxin signals are translated into vein patterning inputs. Within broad fields of MP expression, however, only a subset of cells initiates expression of ATHB8. Here we discuss putative mechanisms by which wide domains of MP expression could activate ATHB8 transcription in single cell files.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aleaves 3aepidermis (plant) 3acambium 3aplant veins 3acell growth 3acell differentiation 3aplant development 3aauxins 3asignal transduction 3agene expression regulation 3atranscription factors 2aArabidopsisxgeneticsxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aArabidopsis Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aDNA-Binding Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aGene Expression Regulation, Developmental 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plant 2aGenes, Homeobox 2aGenes, Plant 2aHomeodomain Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aIndoleacetic Acidsxmetabolism 2aPlant Leavesxgeneticsxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aPlant Structuresxgeneticsxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aSignal Transduction 2aTranscription Factorsxgeneticsxmetabolism.1 aSherr, Ira1 aScarpella, Enrico0 tPlant signaling & behavior.g2010 Jan. 1, v. 5, no. 1 p.70-72dTaylor & FranciswJournal:2184x1559-23247nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.4161/psb.5.1.102333Available from publisher's site 7aarticle03015naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245010500168520179600273592002802069650001602097650003002113650001102143650001002154650001602164651001002180651001602190653002702206653002202233653002202255653002302277653002102300653002402321700002002345700001702365700003102382773011302413856008202526852000902608655001202617IND60752507720221120103005.0211123e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075250772DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jas.2021.1054902doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFinlayson, Sarah10aSearching for ancient Aegean administrators: Computational experiments on identical seal impressions  aSeals and sealings were widely used in Neopalatial Crete, primarily in community-wide administrative systems to manage the movement and storage of goods, but also to secure or control channels of intra-site communication using parchment documents. The main principle of this monitoring process was the use of the seal impression as an ‚Äòindexical‚Äô sign, that is, as a means of identifying a seal-user who was acting in an authorising or securing role. Given the fact that seal-users could be acting on their own behalf or, alternatively, as representatives of an institution, there is uncertainty in the literature still over whether the seal impression stood for a single identifiable individual or not. In this paper, we present a new computational methodology for identifying and quantifying similarity within sets of multiple seal impressions made by the same seal. Using a combination of visualisations derived from computational analysis of 3-D scans, experimental work to make seal impressions, and scrutiny of the relevant sealing casts within the Corpus of Minoan and Mycenaean Seals, Heidelberg, we are able to identify groups of sealings impressed in significantly similar ways. We consider it probable that seal impressions with a high degree of similarity were made by the same individual or by two or more people trained to work in a very specific way. This computational methodology is transferable and would prove valuable for other collections of material with identifiable repeated visual elements, such as coins. The implications of our research and the nuance it adds to reconstructions of Neopalatial sealing practices are of broader relevance for sphragistic studies, and provide a point of comparison with the contemporary sealing material of the Ancient Near East.  aPublisher supplied data 3aarchaeology 3acomputational methodology 3apeople 3aseals 3auncertainty 3aCrete 3aMiddle East 0aSealing administration 0aSealing practices 0aNeopalatial Crete 0aGold sealing rings 0aMachine learning 0a3-D computer vision1 aBogacz, Bartosz1 aMara, Hubert1 aPanagiotopoulos, Diamantis0 tJournal of archaeological science.g2021 Dec., v. 136 p.105490-dElsevier LtdwJournal:3403x0305-44037nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jas.2021.1054903Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01733naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002500142245011600167300001800283520044900301592002800750650001400778650001100792650001900803650001500822650002000837700006300857700006000920700006000980700006001040700006301100773014701163856007601310852000901386655001201395IND60603906020221120213329.0180716e20180423xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060390602DNAL7 a10.1021/jacs.8b029632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVaccarello, David N.10aSynthesis of Semicrystalline Polyolefin Materials: Precision Methyl Branching via Stereoretentive Chain Walking  ap. 6208-6211.  aWe report the discovery of C‚ÇÇ-symmetric nickel catalysts capable of the regio- and isoselective polymerization of 1-butene to produce isotactic 4,2-poly(1-butene), a new semi-crystalline polyolefin.

While studied extensively in the context of antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs), few studies have examined the impact of homogenous labeling on the properties of antibody-fluorophore conjugates (AFCs). We report the application of pentafluorophenyl (PFP) esters, which had previously been shown to be reasonably selective for K188 of the kappa light chain of human IgG antibodies, toward producing AFCs. We show that simple replacement of N-hydroxy succinimide (NHS) with PFP dramatically increases the light-chain specificity of near-infrared (NIR) AFCs. Comparing the properties of AFCs labeled using NHS and PFP-activated esters reveals that the latter exhibits reduced aggregation and improved brightness, both in vitro and in vivo. Overall, the use of PFP esters provides a remarkably simple approach to provide selectively labeled antibodies with improved properties.  aPublisher supplied data 3aesters 3afluorescent dyes 3ahumans 3amonoclonal antibodies 0aAntibody labeling 0aSite specific chemistry 0aFluorophore synthesis 0aCyanine chemistry1 aDingle, Ivan1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3860-43121 aNourian, Saghar1 aSchnermann, Martin J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0503-01160 tTetrahedron letters.g2021 July 06, v. 75 p.153211-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11745x0040-40397nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tetlet.2021.1532113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02561naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004100092040001800133100002200151245012000173300001800293500001500311520136400326592002801690650003001718650001401748650001301762650001601775650001101791650001101802650001601813650001901829650001601848650001401864650002201878650001401900650001201914651001201926653001601938773010101954856008702055852000902142655001202151IND4475776520221121005938.0150808e20110924xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447577652DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2011.07.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRempel, Robert S.10aEffects of climate change on moose populations: Exploring the response horizon through biometric and systems models  ap. 3355-3365.  a2019-12-06  aInterest in the response of moose to climate change has increased because of the potential role they play in the conservation of woodland caribou, and threatened loss to recreational and economic opportunities. The objective of this study is to develop a plausible, parsimonious, systems-level model of moose population dynamics that will be useful in exploring the response of moose populations to climate projections. The study begins with a statistical model of moose carrying capacity, which is then integrated into a systems-level model that predicts moose density based on explicit causal factors. Scenario analysis was conducted using a variety of assumptions concerning biotic and abiotic interactions, and under the A2 climate scenario all model scenarios predict a decline of moose density at the southern limits of the Ontario distribution and an increase at the northern extents. Predicted declines are a result of lower carrying capacity and higher heat stress, parasite loads and wolf predation. Given the sensitivity of the model to density-dependent factors, the indirect effect of parasites on decreased recruitment may have greater impact on moose than the direct effect of increased death rate. Results indicate that conservation planning for woodland caribou populations should account for possible increases in moose and wolf populations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRangifer tarandus caribou 3aparasites 3aplanning 3aparasitoses 3amodels 3awolves 3aheat stress 3aclimate change 3aAlces alces 3apredation 3acarrying capacity 3amortality 3aclimate 3aOntario 0arecruitment0 tEcological modelling.g2011 Sept. 24, v. 222, no. 18 p.3355-3365dElsevier B.V.x0304-38007nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2011.07.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03595naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100006000144245013100204300002000335500001900355520189600374592002802270650001502298650001302313650002502326650001502351650001302366650001502379650001902394650001702413650001902430650001702449650003002466653004102496653002902537653001002566653001902576700006102595700001702656700006502673700002502738700005902763700006202822773014202884856007803026852000903104655001203113IND60731144720221120224334.0210317e20210303xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073114472DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.0c219882doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDeSario, Paul A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2964-484910aPhotoenhanced Degradation of Sarin at Cu/TiO‚ÇÇ Composite Aerogels: Roles of Bandgap Excitation and Surface Plasmon Excitation  ap. 12550-12561.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aMultifunctional composites that couple high-capacity adsorbents with catalytic nanoparticles (NPs) offer a promising route toward the degradation of organophosphorus pollutants or chemical warfare agents (CWAs). We couple mesoporous TiO‚ÇÇ aerogels with plasmonic Cu nanoparticles (Cu/TiO‚ÇÇ) and characterize the degradation of the organophosphorus CWA sarin under both dark and illuminated conditions. Cu/TiO‚ÇÇ aerogels combine high dark degradation rates, which are facilitated by hydrolytically active sites at the Cu||TiO‚ÇÇ interface, with photoenhanced degradation courtesy of semiconducting TiO‚ÇÇ and the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) of the Cu nanoparticles. The TiO‚ÇÇ aerogel provides a high surface area for sarin binding (155 m¬≤ g‚Äì¬π), while the addition of Cu NPs increases the abundance of hydrolytically active OH sites. Degradation is accelerated on TiO‚ÇÇ and Cu/TiO‚ÇÇ aerogels with O‚ÇÇ. Under broadband illumination, which excites the TiO‚ÇÇ bandgap and the Cu SPR, sarin degradation accelerates, and the products are more fully mineralized compared to those of the dark reaction. With O‚ÇÇ and broadband illumination, oxidation products are observed on the Cu/TiO‚ÇÇ aerogels as the hydrolysis products subsequently oxidize. In contrast, the photodegradation of sarin on TiO‚ÇÇ is limited by its slow initial hydrolysis, which limits the subsequent photooxidation. Accelerated hydrolysis occurs on Cu/TiO‚ÇÇ aerogels under visible illumination (>480 nm) that excites the Cu SPR but not the TiO‚ÇÇ bandgap, confirming that the Cu SPR excitation contributes to the broadband-driven activity. The high hydrolytic activity of the Cu/TiO‚ÇÇ aerogels combined with the photoactivity upon TiO‚ÇÇ bandgap excitation and Cu SPR excitation is a potent combination of hydrolysis and oxidation that enables the substantial chemical degradation of organophorphorus compounds.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorbents 3aaerogels 3acopper nanoparticles 3ahydrolysis 3alighting 3aphotolysis 3aphotooxidation 3aporous media 3asemiconductors 3asurface area 3asurface plasmon resonance 0achemical warfare agent decomposition 0aplasmonic photochemistry 0asarin 0ain situ DRIFTS1 aGordon, Wesley O.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7766-41021 aBalboa, Alex1 aPennington, Ashley M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2016-49531 aPitman, Catherine L.1 aMcEntee, Monica1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6127-66121 aPietron, Jeremy J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7761-28120 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2021 Mar. 03, v. 13, no. 10 p.12550-12561dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.0c219883Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03409naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245014900169300001600318520180700334592002802141650001302169650002502182650001102207650001202218650002602230650002402256650001102280650002902291650002002320650002202340650001002362650002102372650001802393650002402411650001402435650002902449650001002478650001702488650001702505650001102522651001002533653003202543653002802575653002202603700001402625700001302639700001702652773010402669856008502773852000902858655001202867IND60582458420221122022106.0180830e20171201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058245842DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2017.08.1072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Huiming10aHas government intervention effectively encouraged the use of waste cooking oil as an energy source? Comparison of two Chinese biofuel companies  ap. 708-715.  aThere is a significant difference in the performance of waste cooking oil-to-energy companies in China. Most biofuel companies face a loss while a few others have high recovery rates and strong profitability. To shed light on this phenomenon and to aide in formulating policy, this paper constructs a framework from the two dimensions of X-Y and investigates the impact of government intervention on biofuel companies' performance by taking two companies located in the kitchen waste-to-resource pilot cities of Changzhou and Suzhou. Results indicate that: (1) the basic policy instruments of information disclosed and fee and penalty mechanisms in Changzhou are inferior to those of Suzhou. On the other hand, capital investment and cooperation between stakeholders are better in Changzhou. As for the value chain dimension, the policies are similar in both cities. This means that companies involved in the recycling of waste cooking oil and biofuel production equally neglect research and development, preferential loan and product sales by government. (2) In terms of effectiveness, recycling rates and company profits for Changzhou Yueda Kate New Energy Co. Ltd. are far below those of Suzhou Clean Environmental Technology Co. Ltd. Whether the biofuel companies are authorized by government or not, fee and penalty mechanisms and information disclosure are the key determinants affecting performance of biofuel companies. (3) There is still some room to improve the performance of Suzhou Clean Environmental Technology Co. Ltd. Policies can focus on the following: strengthening R & D, which improves the technological supply and diffusion capability of biofuel companies; building the demand-typed policy frame and adjusting policy structure; improving the market structure of biofuel companies.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiofuels 3abusiness enterprises 3acities 3acooking 3acooking fats and oils 3aeconomic investment 3aenergy 3aenvironmental technology 3afuel production 3aissues and policy 3aloans 3amarket structure 3aprofitability 3aprofits and margins 3arecycling 3aresearch and development 3asales 3astakeholders 3asupply chain 3awastes 3aChina 0aWaste cooking oil-to-energy 0aGovernment intervention 0aPolicy instrument1 aZheng, Yu1 aCao, Jie1 aQiu, Yueming0 tEnergy.g2017 Dec. 01, v. 140 p.708-715dElsevier LtdaElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2017.08.1073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02663naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002500147245011600172300001600288520139800304592002801702650001901730650002201749650001601771650001101787650001001798650001101808650001201819650001001831650001401841650002201855650001101877650001601888651001701904653001801921653002501939653001301964653003001977653001802007773011302025856008202138852000902220655001202229IND60601345920221118224914.0210911e201409  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060134592DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jas.2014.06.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJerardino, Antonieta10aStranded rocky shore mussels and their possible procurement during prehistory on the West Coast of South Africa  ap. 536-545.  aA number of competing or complementary approaches are often used to understand patterns in shellfish abundance in the archaeological record. The relative importance of environmental, behavioural or taphonomic factors lends support to these different models. In the context of South African West Coast shell middens, the procurement of washed-up (stranded) fauna (vertebrates and invertebrates) has been proposed as a possible subsistence adaptation since the Late Pleistocene. The collection of washed-up rocky shore mussels (Choromytilus meridionalis), particularly, has been suggested to account for shellfish species composition in West Coast sites. The objective of this paper is to test this scenario by means of field observations from natural assemblages (washed-up mussels and storm beach accumulations) and archaeological observations from ten late Holocene assemblages. Metrical observations of C.¬†meridionalis shells are interpreted in terms of updated knowledge on the biology and ecology of this species and used to bring insight into the procurement of this species. This study shows that less than half of stranded mussels are edible, and that considerable search/handling costs are involved when procuring this source.

Turf producers and breeders attempt to produce new and improved turf cultivars, but they are largely unaware of the consumers‚Äô preferences for specific turfgrass attributes. This study illustrates the use of discrete-choice analysis, a stated preference marketing valuation technique in estimating consumers‚Äô preferences and willingness to pay for turfgrass attributes. Results of a survey of 1,179 household consumers indicate that preferences for stress tolerant turfgrass cultivars are highly heterogeneous. A latent class model shows that household turf consumers are clustered in two broad classes; ‚ÄúWilling Hobby Gardeners‚Äù and ‚ÄúReluctant Mature Homeowners‚Äù. Willing hobby gardeners are characterized as hobbyists and more willing adopters of improved turfgrass cultivars, while reluctant mature homeowners are characterized by mature (more than 45 years of age) homeowners and more reluctant adopters of improved turfgrass cultivars that minimize environmental stressors. Results show that Willing Hobby Gardeners are most likely to pay more for improved turfgrass attributes than Reluctant Mature Homeowners. This categorization of consumers may help sod producers, urban planners, and landscape firms in targeting willing gardeners and in strategizing how to reach reluctant homeowners.  aPublisher supplied data 3aconsumer preferences 3acultivars 3afertilizers 3agardeners 3aherbicides 3ahomeowners 3alandscapes 3alawns and turf 3amarketing 3amodels 3apublic policy 3arunoff 3asalinity 3asurface water 3asurveys 3aturf grasses 3aurban areas 3awater requirement 3awillingness to pay 3awinter 0aTurfgrass attributes 0aUrban homeowners 0aPreference heterogeneity 0aWillingness to pay 0aLatent class models1 aBoyer, Tracy A.1 aChung, Chanjin0 tUrban forestry & urban greening.g2019 Feb., v. 38 p.183-192dElsevier GmbHaElsevier GmbHwJournal:jnl893556x1618-86677nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ufug.2018.12.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01737naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001400155245010700169300001600276520079900292592002801091650001701119650000901136650001401145700002001159700001301179700001501192700002001207773007501227856008901302990002301391852000901414655001201423IND60096040220221119093018.0141104e201311  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009604022DNAL7 a10.1016/j.compositesb.2013.05.0392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHe, Rujie10aPreparation of YAG gel coated ZrB‚ÇÇ‚ÄìSiC composite prepared by gelcasting and pressureless sintering  ap. 307-312.  aIn this paper, gelcasting and pressureless sintering of YAG gel coated ZrB‚ÇÇ‚ÄìSiC (YZS) composite were conducted.

The gelcast YZS sample was then pressureless sintered to about 97% density. During sintering, YAG promoted the densification process from solid state sintering to liquid phase sintering. The average grain sizes of ZrB‚ÇÇ and SiC in the YZS composite were 3.8 and 1.3Œºm, respectively. The flexural strength, fracture toughness and microhardness were 375¬±37MPa, 4.13¬±0.45MPam¬π/¬≤ and 14.1¬±0.5GPa, respectively.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacrylic acid 3agels 3aviscosity1 aZhang, Xinghong1 aHu, Ping1 aHan, Wenbo1 aHong, Changqing0 tComposites.g2013 Nov., v. 54 p.307-312dElsevier Ltdx1359-83687nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.compositesb.2013.05.0393Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02729naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001700152245007500169300001600244520154700260592002801807650001301835650002601848650001201874650001401886650001701900650002101917650002601938650001001964650001801974650002501992651001102017700001402028700001502042700001702057700001502074700001102089700002402100773008802124856008602212852000902298655001202307IND60089127820221117194740.0141102e201211  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008912782DNAL7 a10.1016/j.atmosenv.2012.05.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVarotsos, C.13aAn observational study of the atmospheric ultra-fine particle dynamics  ap. 312-319.  aThis paper presents results derived from ultra-fine particle observations conducted in urban and semi-rural areas of the Athens basin in Greece. Aerosol particle size spectra were collected at 2.5-min time resolution with a Scanning Mobility Particle Sizer for approximately two months, along with standard meteorological, NO, NO‚ÇÇ and O‚ÇÉ measurements. The results obtained showed that a 10-fold less maximum number concentration of the mean spectrum was noticed at the semi-rural site compared with that at the urban site. The corresponding maximum for the median spectrum of urban site was only 20% less, indicating that extreme cases had little effect, at least in maximum mean concentration of 9.8¬†nm particles. The largest number concentration maximum in the mean size distribution spectrum for each area occurred at a modal diameter ‚â§9.8 nm. For particles ‚â•13.4 nm, the mean spectrum for Patision contained prominent accumulation particle populations at number median diameters of 13.4, 29.7, and 43.7 nm. In contrast, the major features of the accumulation region of the mean semi-rural spectrum were fit with 5 distribution functions of nearly the same amplitude. The most dominant feature occurred at a number median diameter of 70.1 nm, and thus substantially greater than the 43.7 nm most-dominant in the mean urban spectrum. High ultra-fine particle concentrations at the urban site generally coincided with periods of high NO concentrations and were well correlated with benzene, signifying emissions from motor vehicles.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaerosols 3aatmospheric chemistry 3abenzene 3aemissions 3anitric oxide 3anitrogen dioxide 3aobservational studies 3aozone 3aparticle size 3avehicles (equipment) 3aGreece1 aOndov, J.1 aTzanis, C.1 a√ñzt√ºrk, F.1 aNelson, M.1 aKe, H.1 aChristodoulakis, J.0 tAtmospheric environment.g2012 Nov., v. 59 p.312-319dElsevier Ltdx1352-23107nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.atmosenv.2012.05.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02428naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245018200165300001400347520126200361592002801623650002001651650001301671650002801684650000901712650002301721650001901744650002001763650002801783650001501811700001801826700002001844700001301864773009901877856008101976852000902057655001202066IND60085724720221119033722.0141101e20111017xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008572472DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aca.2011.08.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSong, Wenjing10aPotentiometric flow injection system for determination of reductants using a polymeric membrane permanganate ion-selective electrode based on current-controlled reagent delivery  ap. 68-72.  aA polymeric membrane permanganate-selective electrode has been developed as a current-controlled reagent release system for potentiometric detection of reductants in flow injection analysis. By applying an external current, diffusion of permanganate ions across the polymeric membrane can be controlled precisely. The permanganate ions released at the sample-membrane interface from the inner filling solution of the electrode are consumed by reaction with a reductant in the sample solution thus changing the measured membrane potential, by which the reductant can be sensed potentiometrically. Ascorbate, dopamine and norepinephrine have been employed as the model reductants. Under the optimized conditions, the potential peak heights are proportional to the reductant concentrations in the ranges of 1.0√ó10‚Åª‚Åµ to 2.5√ó10‚Åª‚Å∑M for ascorbate, of 1.0√ó10‚Åª‚Åµ to 5.0√ó10‚Åª‚Å∑M for dopamine, and of 1.0√ó10‚Åª‚Åµ to 5.0√ó10‚Åª‚Å∑M for norepinephrine, respectively with the corresponding detection limits of 7.8√ó10‚Åª‚Å∏, 1.0√ó10‚Åª‚Å∑ and 1.0√ó10‚Åª‚Å∑M. The proposed system has been successfully applied to the determination of reductants in pharmaceutical preparations and vegetables, and the results agree well with those of iodimetric analysis.  aPublisher supplied data 3adetection limit 3adopamine 3aflow injection analysis 3aions 3amembrane potential 3anorepinephrine 3areducing agents 3aspecific ion electrodes 3avegetables1 aDing, Jiawang1 aLiang, Rongning1 aQin, Wei0 tAnalytica chimica acta.g2011 Oct. 17, v. 704, no. 1-2 p.68-72dElsevier B.V.x0003-26707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aca.2011.08.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03701naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001800149245011900167300001600286520231200302592002802614650000802642650001702650650001302667650001502680650001602695650001502711650001502726650001902741650001702760650001302777650001502790650001502805650003702820650001202857650001302869653002002882653002702902653002702929653002202956700001302978700001402991700001303005773010803018856008403126852000903210655001203219IND60541087520221122140939.0190318e201411  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054108752DNAL7 a10.1016/j.still.2014.01.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKuncoro, P.H.12aA study on the effect of compaction on transport properties of soil gas and water. II: Soil pore structure indices  ap. 180-187.  aExperimental data on the effects of compaction and applied organic matter (OM) on macropore structure indices, more particularly on pore continuity, have yet rarely been documented. In this study, static compaction was simulated in the laboratory at 150, 225, and 300kPa upon rice husk, rice straw, compost, sawdust, and wood bark-mixed soils and control. Measurements of relative gas diffusivity (Dp/D0)100 and air permeability (ka100) were conducted at ‚àí100cm H2O soil matric suction after measurement of saturated hydraulic conductivity (ks). Corresponding dry bulk density (œÅd), total porosity (f), and air content (…õ100) values were also determined. Volume of macropores (œï‚â•30Œºm) and micropores (œï<30Œºm) were expressed as volume of air and water at ‚àí100cm H2O soil matric suction, respectively, relative to the volume of soil solid. Specific gas diffusivity (SD100) and specific air permeability (Ska100) were calculated as (Dp/D0)100/…õ100 and ka100/…õ100, respectively. Analogous to the SD100 and Ska100, specific hydraulic conductivity (Sks) was defined as ks/…õ100. The results showed that compaction significantly increased œÅd, which was followed by a reduction in f, and the mixed OM resulted in a significantly lower œÅd and higher f than the control. The volume of macropores was reduced by compaction whereas the volume of micropores remained unaffected, for which the mixed OM tended to result in a higher volume of macropores than the control. Compaction resulted in more tortuous macropores for gas diffusion (lower SD100) and less continuous macropores for gas convection (lower Ska100) for which a significant difference was more pronounced between the 300 and 150kPa compactions. Compaction also resulted in fewer continuous macropores for water movement as indicated by lower Sks. The mixed OM was likely to result in a lower SD100, but except for rice straw tended to result in a higher Ska100 than the control. In addition, the mixed OM also seemed to result in a higher Sks than the control. Of the OM-mixed soils, the decrease in (Dp/D0)100 and ka100 was more sensitive to compaction (i.e., decrease in …õ100) than that of the control whereas the decrease in ks acted conversely. Discussion of the measured (Dp/D0)100, ka100, and ks is presented in the companion paper.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3abulk density 3acomposts 3aconvection 3adiffusivity 3amacropores 3amicropores 3aorganic matter 3apermeability 3aporosity 3arice hulls 3arice straw 3asaturated hydraulic conductivity 3asawdust 3asoil air 0aSoil compaction 0aApplied organic matter 0aPore size distribution 0aPore organization1 aKoga, K.1 aSatta, N.1 aMuto, Y.0 tSoil & tillage research.g2014 Nov., v. 143 p.180-187dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl32961x0167-19877nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.still.2014.01.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02057naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002700155245009500182300001600277520102300293592002801316650001201344650002801356650002001384650001301404650001101417650001201428650001101440700002301451700001901474700001801493773007501511856008901586990002301675852000901698655001201707IND60096040420221119093006.0141104e201311  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009604042DNAL7 a10.1016/j.compositesb.2013.05.0292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLopez-Arraiza, Alberto10aHigh performance composite nozzle for the improvement of cooling in grinding machine tools  ap. 313-318.  aAlthough grinding is one of the most versatile machining operations that can be used to produce surface finish up to the micrometer level; it often induces thermal damage to a ground surface and higher power consumption if careful selection of grinding parameters are not made.

The current investigation further aims to correlate the effect of tool geometry developed on grinding process conditions through experiment and modeling by means of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) and Finite Element Analysis (FEA). The results show that with the use of the newly developed composite nozzle, a 30% decrease in coolant waste was achieved.

While the general public is not fond of unkempt greenery, a less-manicured UGS that balances the spontaneous growth of plants and maintenance regimes may be accepted. The paper describes a study exploring accepted degrees of UGS wildness, specifically areas that are currently mown lawns. In the study, a photo elicitation survey administered two sets of photos to two groups of respondents, 663 members of the general population and an additional 48 members of nature/environmental interest groups. The survey assessed perceptions of managed greenery, with three different degrees of growth of lawns in four contexts and six types of landscape elements in wilder lawns. The study found the preferred level of wildness of UGS varied depending on the context, people were generally not against moderately wilder UGS. The utilitarian aspect of landscape was a primary factor in the preference for less-manicured lawns, and aesthetics were a secondary factor. Also, general population characteristics did not consistently predict preference for any vegetation growth condition, and landscape elements differentially affected the degree of preference for wilder lawns. The article concludes by discussing the practical consequences of these findings for the inclusion of wilder UGS in design and management.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaesthetics 3abiodiversity 3acities 3aecosystem services 3agreen infrastructure 3alandscapes 3alawns and turf 3apeople 3aplant growth 3apopulation characteristics 3asurveys 3avegetation 0aUrban green spaces 0aNatural growth 0aPublic preference 0aPhoto elicitation survey 0aAccepted degree of wildness1 aYue, Zi En Jonathan1 aLing, Seow Kang1 aTan, Hee Hiong Victor0 tUrban forestry & urban greening.g2019 Feb., v. 38 p.165-176dElsevier GmbHwJournal:jnl893556x1618-86677nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ufug.2018.12.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02217naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001400150245010000164300001400264520100100278592002801279650001501307650001201322650001601334650002001350650001301370650001601383650001601399653002801415653002401443653004001467653001701507700001301524700001501537700001101552700001201563700005001575773008801625856008501713852000901798655001201807IND60582459020221121221339.0180830e20171215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058245902DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2017.09.0592doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, H.10aPhotothermal conversion characteristics of gold nanoparticles under different filter conditions  ap. 32-39.  aIn this article, plasmonic nanopaerticles (PNP) were used to improve the solar thermal conversion efficiency and the abortion prosperity under eight different wavelength spectrum was compared. Gold nanoparticles (GNP) is synthesized through an improved citrate-reduction method, which was used to illustrate the photo-thermal conversion of PNPs under a solar simulator with eight filters. Experimental results showed that the best light intensities at wavelength of 710¬†nm could reach 0.004¬†W/cm¬≤ when applied to two suns. With the increase of the irradiation time, the GNP temperature increased linearly and the temperature could be increased by 3.5¬†K within 300¬†s. In addition, there were no infrared, no visible light, and no UV filters utilized to compare GNP photothermal conversion efficiencies in three main spectrum regions. As eight filters were applied in the current experiment, more specified wavelength spectrum and longer time need to be tested for the purpose of optimisation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aUV filters 3afilters 3airradiation 3alight intensity 3ananogold 3atemperature 3awavelengths 0aPlasmonic nanoparticles 0aWavelength spectrum 0aPhoto-thermal conversion efficiency 0aLight filter1 aYang, H.1 aChen, H.J.1 aDu, X.1 aWen, D.1 aWu, H.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2010-67880 tEnergy.g2017 Dec. 15, v. 141 p.32-39dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2017.09.0593Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03285naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100005600147245010500203506011700308506007600425520165600501592002802157506003702185650002502222650001102247650001502258650001702273653002802290653001602318653002002334653002402354700002202378700006102400700001902461700002202480700002602502700002702528700001902555700001802574700001902592700002102611773010402632856008202736852000902818655001202827IND60776992420221207111302.0220523e202204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077699242DNAL7 a10.1016/j.esg.2022.1001432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTye, Mari R.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2491-102014aThe food water energy nexus in an urban context: Connecting theory and practice for nexus governance  aCreative Commons Attribution¬†4.0¬†Generic (CC BY-NC-ND¬†4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe growing body of literature on the Food-Water-Energy (FWE) nexus during the last decade covers a variety of disciplinary perspectives and spatial scales. However, to date the urban FWE nexus has received less attention. In this paper, we review the FWE nexus literature with the focus on urban scale and identify gaps in the scholarly knowledge base with regard to practical applications for the FWE nexus governance in cities. Our findings suggest that there is still a mismatch between theoretical nexus governance and community perceptions. Successful governance is an iterative process, necessitating stakeholder input, reflection and response. While research developing the body of urban FWE governance knowledge has increased rapidly, reflection on those results to unpack the nexus complexity and support different governance actors is still limited.¬†We discuss an approach for making the FWE nexus connections more visible and practical by focusing on the urban governance actors and illustrating the intersecting interests and concerns of different actors within the food, water, and energy systems. Mapping the urban governance actors to the sub-elements of the FWE systems highlights common connections and overlapping interests, paving the road toward more integrated governance and participatory solutions. Identifying the tangible and intangible connections among governance actors also helps to reduce the ambiguity of the FWE nexus, and facilitates multi-stakeholder knowledge, data or resources sharing. The resultant approach aims to disaggregate the complexity of the FWE nexus and make its governance more attainable in cities.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aEarth system science 3aenergy 3agovernance 3astakeholders 0aFood-water-energy nexus 0aUrban scale 0aCitizen science 0aGovernance approach1 aWilhelmi, Olga V.1 aPierce, Andrea L.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9941-57641 aSharma, Saloni1 aNichersu, Iuliana1 aWr√≥blewski, Micha≈Ç,1 aGoszczy≈Ñski, Wojciech1 aWendel, Jochen1 aLaborgne, Pia1 aHeyder, Monika1 aNichersu, Iulian0 tEarth system governance.g2022 Apr., v. 12 p.100143-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:27266x2589-81167nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.esg.2022.1001433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02445naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001600155245009900171300001400270520146500284592002801749650001101777650001301788650002101801650001101822650001301833650001901846650001301865650002101878650001401899773007301913856008901986990002302075852000902098655001202107IND60096040720221119092805.0141104e201311  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009604072DNAL7 a10.1016/j.compositesb.2013.04.0682doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGode, Ceren10aMechanical properties of hot pressed SiCp and B4Cp/Alumix 123 composites alloyed with minor Zr  ap. 34-40.  aIn the present study, effect of Zr addition on the microstructure and wear behavior of aluminum alloy composites (AMCs) reinforced with B4Cp and SiCp particles fabricated via hot pressing were investigated. The samples for the study composed of unreinforced aluminum alloy (Alumix 123) and the composites reinforced with 10% B4Cp and % SiCp were prepared by hot isostatic pressing (HIP) method. Similarly, all the samples alloyed with 0.2% Zr were also produced in order to make a comparison. The produced samples were evaluated for microstructural properties and mechanical tests for hardness, tensile and bending strength were performed. Wear test was carried out at 5mm/s sliding speed under 3.0N load for the all kind of hot pressed produced samples. The hot pressed composite microstructures have a more uniform distribution of the reinforcements. After HIP process, the composites were successfully produced with high density (>99%). The addition of Zr increased the yield and tensile strength of the samples. The highest strength value was found for the sample Al 123 matrix alloy with Zr. Evaluation of microstructures showed that copper and zirconium dispersed equally within the matrix microstructure without agglomeration. For the composite samples, Al3Zr, appeared as white precipitate, were inspected around B4C and SiC particles. The composite containing SiC particles and Zr had wear resistance value superior to those of the other counterparts.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalloys 3aaluminum 3abending strength 3acopper 3ahardness 3amicrostructure 3apressing 3atensile strength 3azirconium0 tComposites.g2013 Nov., v. 54 p.34-40dElsevier Ltdx1359-83687nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.compositesb.2013.04.0683Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03463naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094024002200125024001900147040001800166100002100184242011300205245014400318300001600462506007600478520180000554592002802354506003702382650002202419650001502441650001402456650002402470650001102494650001602505650001102521650001302532700001702545700001502562700001802577700001402595700001502609700001702624700001802641700001802659700002202677700005402699773013002753856007702883852000902960655001202969IND60626186620221207093741.0181218e201812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062618662DNAL7 a10.1631/jzus.B18003812doi7 aPMC63052562pmcid7 a305070762pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiao, Zheng-luan10aÂü∫‰∫é‰∏âÁΩëÁªúÊ®°ÂºèÁöÑÈòøÂ∞îËå®Êµ∑ÈªòÁóÖÂíåÈÅóÂøòÂûãËΩªÂ∫¶ËÆ§Áü•ÂäüËÉΩÈöúÁ¢çÁöÑÂçäÁêÉÈó¥ÂäüËÉΩËøûÊé•Á†îÁ©∂10aInterhemispheric functional connectivity for Alzheimer‚Äôs disease and amnestic mild cognitive impairment based on the triple network model  ap. 924-934.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe purpose of this study was to explore the differences in interhemispheric functional connectivity in patients with Alzheimer‚Äôs disease (AD) and amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) based on a triple network model consisting of the default mode network (DMN), salience network (SN), and executive control network (ECN). The technique of voxel-mirrored homotopic connectivity (VMHC) analysis was applied to explore the aberrant connectivity of all patients. The results showed that: (1) the statistically significant connections of interhemispheric brain regions included DMN-related brain regions (i.e. precuneus, calcarine, fusiform, cuneus, lingual gyrus, temporal inferior gyrus, and hippocampus), SN-related brain regions (i.e. frontoinsular cortex), and ECN-related brain regions (i.e. frontal middle gyrus and frontal inferior); (2) the precuneus and frontal middle gyrus in the AD group exhibited lower VMHC values than those in the aMCI and healthy control (HC) groups, but no significant difference was observed between the aMCI and HC groups; and (3) significant correlations were found between peak VMHC results from the precuneus and Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Montreal Cognitive Scale (MOCA) scores and their factor scores in the AD, aMCI, and AD plus aMCI groups, and between the results from the frontal middle gyrus and MOCA factor scores in the aMCI group. These findings indicated that impaired interhemispheric functional connectivity was observed in AD and could be a sensitive neuroimaging biomarker for AD. More specifically, the DMN was inhibited, while the SN and ECN were excited. VMHC results were correlated with MMSE and MOCA scores, highlighting that VMHC could be a sensitive neuroimaging biomarker for AD and the progression from aMCI to AD.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAlzheimer disease 3abiomarkers 3acognition 3acognitive disorders 3acortex 3ahippocampus 3amodels 3apatients1 aTan, Yun-fei1 aQiu, Ya-ju1 aZhu, Jun-peng1 aChen, Yan1 aLin, Si-si1 aWu, Ming-hao1 aMao, Yan-ping1 aHu, Jiao-jiao1 aDing, Zhong-xiang1 aYu, En-yan1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0674-613X0 tJournal of Zhejiang University.g2018 Dec., v. 19, no. 12 p.924-934dZhejiang University PresswJournal:5353x1673-15817nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1631/jzus.B18003813Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02031naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245008800163300001400251520094000265592002801205650001601233650001101249650001301260650001101273650001801284651001501302651001401317653002001331653002101351653001301372653001801385653002001403700003401423773011001457856008101567852000901648655001201657IND60601346520221118225111.0180706e201410  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060134652DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jas.2014.06.0192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKay, Marvin10aFunctional analysis of prismatic blades and bladelets from Pinson Mounds, Tennessee  ap. 63-83.  aHopewell prismatic blade industries are a standardized technology but not a specialized one.

That Hopewell prismatic blade technology satisfied basic tool needs concurrent with efficient usage of toolstone are beyond dispute. Prismatic blades from Pinson Mounds and other Hopewell sites in the Midwest and Southeast United States were simple, easily repaired, modular tool forms of variable usage. This functional evaluation of 125 artifacts documents far distant preferential exploitation of prismatic blade toolstone sources within the Ohio River valley and its tributaries, reveals statistically significant differences among seven technological types, explicates a production chain model for burins, and argues that prismatic blade technology had an equal or greater social meaning and identity as a quintessential symbol of the Hopewell Interaction Sphere.  aPublisher supplied data 3aarchaeology 3ablades 3aindustry 3amodels 3ariver valleys 3aOhio River 3aTennessee 0aLithic use-wear 0aPrismatic blades 0aHopewell 0aPinson Mounds 0aNomarski optics1 aMainfort, R.

Through the application of state-of-the-art geophysical techniques, unprecedented insight is being gathered into the buried archaeological features of the area. However, applied survey techniques have rarely targeted natural soil variation, and the detailed knowledge of the palaeotopography is consequently less complete. In addition, metallic topsoil debris, scattered over different parts of the Stonehenge landscape, often impacts the interpretation of geophysical datasets. The research presented here demonstrates how a single multi-receiver electromagnetic induction (EMI) survey, conducted over a 22¬†ha area within the Stonehenge landscape, offers detailed insight into natural and anthropogenic soil variation at Stonehenge. The soil variations that were detected through recording the electrical and magnetic soil variability, shed light on the genesis of the landscape, and allow for a better definition of potential palaeoenvironmental and archaeological sampling locations. Based on the multi-layered dataset, a procedure was developed to remove the influence of topsoil metal from the survey data, which enabled a more straightforward identification of the detected archaeology. The results provide a robust basis for further geoarchaeological research, while potential to differentiate between modern soil disturbances and the underlying sub-surface variations can help in solving conservation and management issues. Through expanding this approach over the wider area, we aim at a fuller understanding of the human‚Äìlandscape interactions that have shaped the Stonehenge landscape.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanthropogenic soil types 3aarchaeology 3ageophysics 3alandscapes 3amagnetism 3apaleoecology 3asoil heterogeneity 3asurveys 3atopsoil 3aUnited Kingdom 0aMulti-receiver electromagnetic induction 0aDigital soil mapping 0aNear-surface geophysics 0aStonehenge 0aElectrical conductivity 0aMagnetic susceptibility 0aMetal detection1 aVan Meirvenne, Marc1 aSaey, Timothy1 aBaldwin, Eamonn1 aGaffney, Chris1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8292-21181 aGaffney, Vincent L.,0 tJournal of archaeological science.g2014 Oct., v. 50 p.16-23dElsevier LtdwJournal:3403x0305-44037nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jas.2014.06.0203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03139naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245009200171500001900263520136200282592002801644650002101672650002701693650000801720650002601728650002001754650001701774650002001791650002801811650001401839650001301853650001401866650001001880650001901890650002001909650002001929653001801949653002301967653001301990653001802003653000802021653000802029653000802037653001002045653000802055653000702063653000802070653000702078653000802085653000802093653000702101653000902108700002302117700002602140700005802166700001502224700005902239773009702298856008502395852000902480655001202489IND60741012620221120165955.0210806e20210801xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074101262DNAL7 a10.1016/j.watres.2021.1173212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPatinglag, Laila10aNon-thermal plasma-based inactivation of bacteria in water using a microfluidic reactor  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aFailure of conventional water treatment systems may lead to the contamination of water sources, which can cause outbreaks of waterborne healthcare associated infections. Advanced oxidation processing by non-thermal plasma has the potential to treat water without the addition of chemicals. Antibiotic resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli were chosen to investigate the use of non-thermal plasma generated in a microfluidic reactor to disinfect bacteria contaminated water. The microfluidic reactor used in this study utilized a dielectric barrier discharge, in a gas-liquid phase annular flow regime. Microbiological analysis of water inoculated with P. aeruginosa and E. coli was carried out before and after plasma treatment. Using air as the carrier gas, effective disinfection of water was achieved. At the lowest flow rate (35 ¬µL/min), P. aeruginosa and E. coli viability were drastically reduced, with an approximate 8 log maximum decrease in viability following an estimated residence time of 5¬†s of plasma treatment. Scanning electron microscopy indicated changes in cell morphology due to the plasma treatment. Live/Dead assays revealed that the membranes of the cells had been damaged after plasma treatment. This work demonstrated that non-thermal plasma has the potential to disinfect against microbial contamination in water.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aPseudomonas aeruginosa 3aair 3aantibiotic resistance 3acell structures 3adisinfection 3ahealth services 3amicrobial contamination 3aoxidation 3aresearch 3aviability 3awater 3awater analysis 3awater pollution 3awater treatment 0aMicrofluidics 0aAtmospheric plasma 0aBacteria 0aContamination 0aCFU 0aDBD 0aEPS 0aHCAIs 0aNHS 0aOD 0aPBS 0aPI 0aSEM 0aSCV 0aUV 0aVBNC1 aMelling, Louise M.1 aWhitehead, Kathryn A.1 aSawtell, David1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3992-68501 aIles, Alex1 aShaw, Kirsty J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9241-41950 tWater research.g2021 Aug. 01, v. 201 p.117321-dElsevier LtdwJournal:1966x0043-13547nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2021.1173213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02600naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245015200168300002000320520101100340592002801351650004401379650001701423650001901440650002101459650001401480650001701494650001601511650001001527650001201537650001301549650002501562650001801587650001901605650001901624653001301643653002101656653002601677653001701703700005201720700001701772700001601789700001601805700001801821700001501839773014601854856008502000852000902085655001202094IND60708354420221116231331.0200824e20200731xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070835442DNAL7 a10.1021/acssuschemeng.0c040422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Yunxia10aConstruction of Nano-Fe‚ÇÇO‚ÇÉ-Decorated Flower-Like MoS‚ÇÇ with Fe‚ÄìS Bonds for Efficient Photoreduction of CO‚ÇÇ under Visible-Light Irradiation  ap. 12603-12611.  aA p‚Äìn heterostructured Œ±-Fe‚ÇÇO‚ÇÉ/MoS‚ÇÇ composite via Fe‚ÄìS bonds was developed as a highly efficient CO‚ÇÇ photoreduction catalyst driven by visible light. The Œ±-Fe‚ÇÇO‚ÇÉ nanoparticles were embedded between the flower-like MoS‚ÇÇ layers, benefitting for the uniform dispersion of themselves and meanwhile promoting the formation of 1T‚ÄìMoS‚ÇÇ. The construction of p‚Äìn heterostructure caused by Fe‚ÄìS bonds led to the close contact between Œ±-Fe‚ÇÇO‚ÇÉ and MoS‚ÇÇ, in which Œ±-Fe‚ÇÇO‚ÇÉ was capped with few MoS‚ÇÇ layers and enhanced the segregation and transportation of photoinduced electrons and holes. As a result, the 5FM photocatalyst (5 wt % Œ±-Fe‚ÇÇO‚ÇÉ loading on MoS‚ÇÇ) exhibited an excellent CO‚ÇÇ photoreduction performance, which obtained 121 Œºmol¬∑h‚Äì¬π¬∑g‚Äì¬π of CH‚ÇÑ and 41 Œºmol¬∑h‚Äì¬π¬∑g‚Äì¬π of CH‚ÇÉOH.

We investigated the effects of ongoing contamination in mesocosms employing sediments remediated by different types of active and passive caps and in-situ treatment. Our hypothesis was that the sequestering agents used in active caps and in situ treatment will bind elements (arsenic, chromium, cadmium, cobalt, copper, nickel, lead, selenium, and zinc) from ongoing sources thereby reducing their bioavailability and protecting underlying remediated sediments from recontamination. Most element concentrations in surface water remained significantly lower in mesocosms with apatite and mixed amendment caps than in mesocosms with passive caps (sand), uncapped sediment, and spike solution throughout the 2520h experiment. Element concentrations were significantly higher in Lumbriculus variegatus from untreated sediment than in Lumbriculus from most active caps. Pearson correlations between element concentrations in Lumbriculus and metal concentrations in the top 2.5cm of sediment or cap measured by diffusive gradient in thin films (DGT) sediment probes were generally strong (as high as 0.98) and significant (p<0.05) for almost all tested elements. Metal concentrations in both Lumbriculus and sediment/cap were lowest in apatite, mixed amendment, and activated carbon treatments. These findings show that some active caps can protect remediated sediments by reducing the bioavailable pool of metals/metalloids in ongoing sources of contamination.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLumbriculus variegatus 3aactivated carbon 3aapatite 3aarsenic 3abioavailability 3acadmium 3achelating agents 3achromium 3acobalt 3acopper 3aenvironmental impact 3alead 3anickel 3aremediation 3asand 3asediment contamination 3aselenium 3asurface water 3azinc 0aMetals 0aPassive caps 0aActive caps 0aRemediated sediment 0aBioavailability 0aRe-contamination1 aPaller, Michael H.1 aMilliken, Charles E.1 aRedder, Todd M.1 aWolfe, John R.1 aSeaman, John0 tScience of the total environment.g2016 Sept. 01, v. 563-564 p.108-117dElsevier B.V.x0048-96977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2016.04.0503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02289naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001400140245012200154300002000276520097800296592002801274650001901302650002501321650002101346650002201367650001801389650001901407650001301426650001501439650001601454650002201470650001901492700001401511700001201525700002001537700001501557700001601572700001701588700001701605700001501622773012301637856007401760852000901834655001201843IND60641619020221121140900.0190505e20170504xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064161902DNAL7 a10.1039/c7ra02681a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Dezhi12aA high-safety PVDF/Al‚ÇÇO‚ÇÉ composite separator for Li-ion batteries via tip-induced electrospinning and dip-coating  ap. 24410-24416.  aComposite membranes have been fabricated made of ultrafine PVDF fibers via a tip-induced electrospinning (TIE) process and Al‚ÇÇO‚ÇÉ nanoparticles via a dip-coating process.

Topogeographical variations and features causes immense floral and faunal diversity. The present study has been conducted in Parbati Valley to assess the floristic diversity and regeneration of delineated plant communities. Eighty one sites were sampled for compositional and structural diversity of vegetation between 1524‚Äì3407 m amsl in each and every accessible aspects and habitats following standard ecological methods. Thirty forest communities were identified based on Important Value Index. These mainly represented by broad leaved evergreen and deciduous, coniferous evergreen and deciduous and mixed type of communities. In the delineated forest communities total density was ranged from 40.00‚Äì800.00 Ind ha‚Åª¬π; species diversity 0.01‚Äì1.90; Concentration of dominance 0.13‚Äì0.84 and total basal area of 0.08‚Äì126.29 m¬≤ ha‚Åª¬π. Of the identified plant communities, 12 communities showed highest regeneration of dominant species, 2 with highest regeneration of co-dominant species, 6 showed no/poor regeneration and 10 mixed communities with highest regeneration of one of the dominant species. Decrease in species richness was noticed with increasing altitude. Altitudinal shift of some species clearly states the impact of climate change. Unscientific exploitation of forest resources affected the forest ecosystem, thus, adequate planning, continuous monitoring and appropriate management of them is required to understand and conserve the natural ecosystem.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaltitude 3aclimate change 3adominant species 3afauna 3aforest ecosystems 3aforests 3aspecies richness 3aHimalayan region 3aIndia 0aDiversity 0aDistribution 0aDensity 0aPlant communities 0aRegeneration 0aParbati valley 0aConservation and management1 aSamant, S.S.1 aTƒìj≈çvati, A.,1 a, 1 aSingh, Amit0 tIndian journal of ecology.g2021 Apr., v. 48, no. 2 p.332-348dIndian Ecological SocietywJournal:16635x0304-52507nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle02864naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002000140245015700160500001400317520147800331592002801809650002201837650001801859650001301877650001901890650002001909650002401929650001901953650001301972650002001985650002102005650002202026650001402048650001402062650001302076650001802089650001402107650001902121700002102140700001902161700002002180773012202200856007502322852000902397655001202406IND60703445420221117181456.0200721e20200126xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070344542DNAL7 a10.3390/nu120203212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKo, Wang-Sheng 14aThe 25(OH)Vitamin D Status Affected the Effectiveness of Oligo Fucoidan in Patients with Chronic Hepatitis B Virus Infection with Immune Tolerance Phase  aNAL-light  aChronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a serious public health issue. Vitamin D is involved in various pathophysiological mechanisms as an immune modulator and the deficiency rate of vitamin D is prevalent in chronic liver disease. Fucoidan exerts anti-inflammatory, anticoagulant, antitumor, antimetastatic, and antiangiogenetic effects; however, its effect on the immune responses of HBV patients is unclear. This study investigated how 25(OH)Vitamin D status affected the effectiveness of oligo fucoidan in patients with HBV infection in the immune tolerance phase. Fifty-one patients received oligo fucoidan 4400 mg/day for 48 weeks. Flow cytometry was used to detect T lymphocyte markers (CD3‚Å∫CD4‚Å∫, CD3‚Å∫CD8‚Å∫, CD4‚Å∫CD45RO‚Å∫, CD8‚Å∫CD45RO‚Å∫). The levels of white blood cell (WBC), platelets (PLT), and albumin were decreased after 48 weeks of supplementation (p < 0.05). Percentages of CD3‚Å∫CD8‚Å∫ and CD8‚Å∫CD45RO+ cells were decreased after 12 weeks of supplementation (p < 0.05). In patients with adequate vitamin D, HBV-DNA concentrations decreased and the proportion of CD4‚Å∫CD45RO‚Å∫ and CD8‚Å∫CD45RO‚Å∫ cells increased upon oligo fucoidan supplementation. The HBeAg status of one vitamin D-adequate patient changed from positive to negative at the 12th week of supplementation. The oligo fucoidan may regulate immune effects in patients with HBV infection, and the 25(OH)Vitamin D status might have affected the effectiveness of oligo fucoidan.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHepatitis B virus 3aT-lymphocytes 3aalbumins 3aanticoagulants 3ablood platelets 3achronic hepatitis B 3aflow cytometry 3afucoidan 3aimmune response 3aimmunomodulators 3aimmunosuppression 3ainfection 3anutrients 3apatients 3apublic health 3avitamin D 3avitamin status1 aShen, Fang-Ping 1 aShih, Chia-Ju 1 aChiou, Ya-Ling 0 tNutrients.g2020 Jan. 26, v. 12, no. 2dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2271x2072-66437nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu120203213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03091naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001700146245014900163300001600312520151500328592002801843650002401871650002401895650001601919650001601935650002101951650001901972650002801991650001002019650001802029650001802047650003302065650001402098650002402112650001702136650002102153650001902174653004402193653003002237653001802267653001402285653004802299700001602347700001602363773012902379856008002508852000902588655001202597IND60622200220221118045231.0181124e201807  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062220022DNAL7 a10.1177/10820132187608822doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCheong, Ai M10aEmulsifying conditions and processing parameters optimisation of kenaf seed oil-in-water nanoemulsions stabilised by ternary emulsifier mixtures  ap. 404-413.  aKenaf (Hibiscus cannabinus L.) seed oil has been proven for its multi-pharmacological benefits; however, its poor water solubility and stability have limited its industrial applications. This study was aimed to further improve the stability of pre-developed kenaf seed oil-in-water nanoemulsions by using food-grade ternary emulsifiers. The effects of emulsifier concentration (1, 5, 10, 15% w/w), homogenisation pressure (16,000, 22,000, 28,000‚Äâpsi), and homogenisation cycles (three, four, five cycles) were studied to produce high stability of kenaf seed oil-in-water nanoemulsions using high pressure homogeniser. Generally, results showed that the emulsifier concentration and homogenisation conditions had great effect (p‚Äâ<‚Äâ0.05) on the particle sizes, polydispersity index and hence the physical stability of nanoemulsions. Homogenisation parameters at 28,000‚Äâpsi for three cycles produced the most stable homogeneous nanoemulsions that were below 130‚Äânm, below 0.16, and above ‚àí40‚ÄâmV of particle size, polydispersity index, and zeta potential, respectively. Field emission scanning electron microscopy micrograph showed that the optimised nanoemulsions had a good distribution within nano-range. The optimised nanoemulsions were proved to be physically stable for up to six weeks of storage at room temperature. The results from this study also provided valuable information in producing stable kenaf seed oil nanoemulsions for the future application in food and nutraceutical industries.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHibiscus cannabinus 3aambient temperature 3aemulsifiers 3aemulsifying 3afunctional foods 3ahomogenization 3aindustrial applications 3akenaf 3ananoemulsions 3aparticle size 3ascanning electron microscopy 3aseed oils 3astorage temperature 3astorage time 3awater solubility 3azeta potential 0aKenaf (Hibiscus cannabinus L.) seed oil 0ahomogenisation parameters 0ananoemulsions 0astability 0afield emission scanning electron microscopy1 aTan, Chin P1 aNyam, Kar L0 tFood science and technology international.g, v. 24, no. 5 p.404-413dSAGE PublicationswJournal:jnl3949853x1082-01327nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/10820132187608823Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02724naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100003100152245007600183500001900259520149100278592002801769650000801797650002001805650003001825650001501855650001601870650001201886650001001898650001401908650001301922650001701935653002901952653002101981653001402002653002302016653002002039700001602059700002402075773010702099856008702206852000902293655001202302IND60707619620221119102804.0201024e20201201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070761962DNAL7 a10.1016/j.atmosenv.2020.1178362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDunham-Cheatham, Sarrah M.10aEvaluation of sorption surface materials for reactive mercury compounds  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aSorption surfaces are commonly used to collect atmospheric mercury compounds, with a range of materials used by the mercury research community that have different levels of performance. Here, five polymer-based membranes were loaded with ambient reactive mercury and compared to 2 widely used sorption surface materials: nylon and cation exchange membranes. Only 1 tested material, polyethersulfone, performed similarly to the cation exchange membrane; the remaining tested materials sorbed significantly less mercury, and many had significantly higher blank mercury amounts than the cation exchange membrane. Nylon was the only material that was compatible with thermal desorption analysis, as the remaining materials physically degraded or negatively affected the analyzer; however, nylon was not amenable for quantitative analyses under all ambient conditions. Additional testing of the nylon and cation exchange membrane demonstrated that ambient reactive mercury compounds were more stable on both materials than high concentrations of single-source gaseous oxidized mercury compounds. Single-source gaseous oxidized mercury compounds were significantly lost and/or transformed within less than 80 days of storage, whereas ambient reactive mercury compounds were stable on nylon and cation exchange membranes after 190 days of storage. However, minimizing sampling and storage duration, along with exposure of sampled membranes to ambient air, to reduce biasing results is prudent.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3acation exchange 3acation-exchange membranes 3adesorption 3aenvironment 3amercury 3anylon 3aoxidation 3asorption 3astorage time 0aCation exchange membrane 0aReactive mercury 0aRetention 0aThermal desorption 0aTransformations1 aLyman, Seth1 aGustin, Mae Sexauer0 tAtmospheric environment.g2020 Dec. 01, v. 242 p.117836-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12031x1352-23107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.atmosenv.2020.1178363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03267naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002100149245015800170300001400328520187700342592002802219650001302247650002302260650002502283650001002308650001102318650001302329650001102342650001002353650001002363650001302373650001202386650001202398651002502410653004202435653001402477653001402491653001502505653001502520653001902535700002202554700002002576773010902596856008302705852000902788655001202797IND60544644720221118011738.0190417e201412  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054464472DNAL7 a10.1016/j.gecco.2014.08.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFilby, Nicole E.10aLong-term responses of Burrunan dolphins (Tursiops australis) to swim-with dolphin tourism in Port Phillip Bay, Victoria, Australia: A population at risk  ap. 62-71.  aThis study investigated Burrunan dolphin responses to dolphin-swim tour vessels across two time periods: 1998‚Äì2000 and 2011‚Äì2013. A total of 211 dolphin sightings were documented across 306 surveys. Sighting success rate and mean encounter time with dolphins decreased significantly by 12.8% and 8.2 min, respectively, between periods. Approaches that did not contravene regulations elicited highest approach responses by dolphins towards tour vessels, whereas dolphins‚Äô responded to illegal approaches most frequently with avoidance. Small groups responded to tour vessels with avoidance significantly more than large groups. Initial dolphin behaviour had a strong effect on dolphin‚Äôs responses to tour vessels, with resting groups the most likely to exhibit avoidance. Calves were significantly more likely to be present during swims in 2011‚Äì2013. Dolphin‚Äôs responses to tour vessels changed across time, with effect responses (avoidance and approach) increasing significantly as dolphins gained cumulative experience. These dolphins are forced to expend a greater level of time and energy avoiding or approaching boats, shifting from a non-effect response to an effect response. Consequences of this include possible decrease in biological fitness by detracting from core biological activities such as foraging and resting. Combined with a decrease in sighting success between periods, the results imply that this population of dolphins, which is endemic to Australia and listed as threatened under the Victorian Flora and Fauna Guarantee Act 1988, may not be well suited to the dolphin-swim industry. The management implications of these results warrant a shift from passive to active management in Port Phillip Bay. The importance of long-term research is highlighted, given behavioural responses detected herein would be undetected in short-term studies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTursiops 3aat-risk population 3abioactive properties 3aboats 3acalves 3adolphins 3aenergy 3afauna 3aflora 3aforaging 3asurveys 3atourism 3aVictoria (Australia) 0aBurrunan dolphin (Tursiops australis) 0aAvoidance 0aBehaviour 0aCompliance 0aManagement 0aSustainability1 aStockin, Karen A.1 aScarpaci, Carol0 tGlobal ecology and conservation.g2014 Dec., v. 2 p.62-71dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23212x2351-98947nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gecco.2014.08.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02421naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100001800112245014000130300001600270520130000286592002801586650002401614650001301638650002101651650001101672650001601683651002101699653001101720653002501731653001701756700002401773700002001797700001901817700002301836700003301859700002101892773012501913852000902038655001202047IND60747707620221119132147.0210818e202104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074770762DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRawat, Neelam10aMaxent modeling for predicting the potential distribution of Valeriana jatamansi jones. in chakrata forest division of Garhwal Himalaya  ap. 367-372.  aValeriana jatamansi is distributed in subtropical to the temperate regions between 1000 to 3000m in Himalayas.

Jacknife test was used to evaluate the importance of the environmental variables for predictive modelling. Maxent model was highly accurate with a statistically significant AUC value of 0.89. The findings can be applied in various ways such as species restoration and conservation planning, identification of additional localities where V. jatamansi may already exist but has not yet been detected.

However, overall quality of these products can be deteriorated. The aim of this study was to examine the use of a single quality index in evaluating effects of ultrasound technology on quality characteristics of blueberry and cranberry juices and nectars. For the purpose of this study based on 10 quality parameters, two mathematical models for calculating a single total quality index have been introduced. Samples were treated according to the experimental design, with high power ultrasound frequency of 20 kHz under various conditions (treatment time: 3, 6 and 9‚Äâmin, sample temperature: 20‚Äâ‚ÑÉ, for thermosonication: 40 and 60‚Äâ‚ÑÉ and amplitude: 60, 90 and 120‚Äâ¬µm). Mathematical index of total quality index in order to evaluate total quality of ultrasound-treated juices and nectars was established. For cranberry juices, treatments ‚Äò11‚Äô (amplitude 120‚Äâ¬µm) and ‚Äò16‚Äô (amplitude 60‚Äâ¬µm) both for 9‚Äâmin and the temperature of 20‚Äâ‚ÑÉ were best scored for both models.

The a√ßa√≠ palm (Euterpe oleracea Mart.), which is native to South America, produces a small, black-purple fruit which is edible. The fruit has recently become popular as a functional food due to its antioxidant potential. Although several studies have been conducted in vitro and with animals, little is known about the potential health benefits in humans aside from an increase in plasma anti-oxidant capacity. Metabolic syndrome is a condition which is defined by a cluster of risk factors for cardiovascular disease and/or type-2 diabetes. Preliminary studies indicate that a reduction in reactive oxygen species can assist in the normalization of the metabolic pathways involved in this syndrome. METHODS: This was an open label pilot study conducted with 10 overweight adults (BMI ‚â• 25 kg/m¬≤ and ‚â§ 30 kg/m¬≤) who took 100 g a√ßai pulp twice daily for 1 month. The study endpoints included levels of fasting plasma glucose, insulin, cholesterol, triglycerides, exhaled (breath) nitric oxide metabolites (eNO) and plasma levels of high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP). The response of blood glucose, blood pressure and eNO to a standardized meal was determined at baseline and following the 30 day treatment. RESULTS: Compared to baseline, there were reductions in fasting glucose and insulin levels following the 30 day treatment (both p < 0.02). There was also a reduction in total cholesterol (p = 0.03), as well as borderline significant reductions in LDL-cholesterol and the ratio of total cholesterol to HDL-cholesterol (both p = 0.051). Compared to baseline, treatment with a√ßai ameliorated the post-prandial increase in plasma glucose following the standardized meal, measured as the area under the curve (p = 0.047). There was no effect on blood pressure, hs-CRP or eNO. CONCLUSION: In this uncontrolled pilot study, consumption of a√ßai fruit pulp reduced levels of selected markers of metabolic disease risk in overweight adults, indicating that further studies are warranted.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3areactive oxygen species 3afruit pulp 3anoninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 3ablood pressure 3ametabolites 3aadults 3aC-reactive protein 3aanimals 3aglucose 3ahuman health 3aEuterpe oleracea 3afunctional foods 3ametabolic syndrome 3asmall fruits 3ablood glucose 3arisk factors 3atriacylglycerols 3ainsulin 3ain vitro studies 3abody mass index 3aantioxidant activity 3afruits 3acardiovascular diseases 3anitric oxide 3aoverweight 3abiochemical pathways 3acholesterol 3afruit consumption 2aAdolescent 2aAdult 2aAntioxidantsxadministration & dosage 2aArea Under Curve 2aArecaceaexchemistry 2aBlood Glucosexanalysis 2aBlood Pressurexdrug effects 2aC-Reactive Proteinxanalysis 2aCholesterol, HDLxblood 2aCholesterol, LDLxblood 2aEvaluation Studies as Topic 2aFemale 2aFruitxchemistry 2aHumans 2aInsulinxblood 2aMale 2aMiddle Aged 2aOverweightxdrug therapy 2aPilot Projects 2aPlant Preparationsxadministration & dosage 2aPostprandial Period 2aReactive Oxygen Speciesxmetabolism 2aTriglyceridesxblood 2aYoung Adult 3aSouth America 0arisk1 aSingh, Betsy B1 aSingh, Vijay J1 aBarrett, Marilyn L.,0 tNutrition journal.g2011 Dec., v. 10, no. 1 p.377-377dSpringer-Verlagx1475-28917nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1475-2891-10-45  aDNAL 7aarticle01852naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100001800112245005000130300001600180520075200196592002800948650002000976650002500996650002801021650002301049650002501072650002101097650001201118650002101130650002301151650001101174650002201185650001901207651001001226653002801236653001701264700002101281700001801302773012501320852000901445655001201454IND60747707720221119132114.0210818e202104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074770772DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMokashi, M.V.10aOxygen productivity in different tree species  ap. 373-375.  aThe assessment of biomass production, carbon sequestration and oxygen production was assessed in selected nine multipurpose tree species planted on degraded land of Dharwad, Karnataka.

Its runoff experienced rapid changes in the past decades. The trend and driving forces of change of the river‚Äôs runoff has been a hot topic in some academic fields in China in recent years, due to its importance in solving the contradiction between supply and demand of water resources, reasonable exploitation and utilization of water resources and its significance in promoting the social, economic and ecologically sustainable development. The Wuding River is one of the large tributaries in the Middle Yellow River and soil and water conservation measures have been implemented in the tributary much earlier. It can be a good example for investigating the trend and causes of changes of runoff of the Yellow River. In this paper, the variation trend and abrupt change are determined in the time series of annual runoff of the Wuding River recorded at a hydrological station near its outlet during the period from 1956 to 2009 using several time series analysis methods. Secondly, the influences of climate change and human activities are estimated through calculating the amount of runoff reduction due to climate change in different periods. Results show that the annual runoff was continually decreasing, the drought trend was aggravating, and abrupt change in runoff series appeared in 1971 and 1997 as a result of large scale water and soil conservation measure after 1971 and ecosystem restoration program since 1997. It is also found that human activities were the main influence factor for runoff reduction during the period from 1972 to 2009. The contributions from climate change increased from about 23 to 30¬†%, and those from human activities decreased from 77 to 70¬†% from the period of 1972‚Äì1996 to the period of 1997‚Äì2009. Finally, a formula is built to reveal the relation of runoff with both climate factors and each main kind of human activities.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimate change 3aclimatic factors 3adrought 3arivers 3arunoff 3asoil conservation 3asupply balance 3asustainable development 3atime series analysis 3awater conservation 3awater utilization 3aChina 3aYellow River1 aShi, Changxing1 aDu, Jun1 aFan, Xiaoli0 tEnvironmental earth sciences.g2013 May, v. 69, no. 1 p.225-234dSpringer-Verlagx1866-62807nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12665-012-1949-8  aDNAL 7aarticle03869naa a2200613 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024005500111024002000166040001800186072000900204100001700213245013300230300001600363500002400379500001500403520191200418650001302330650001902343650002702362650001102389650001302400650001902413650002502432650001702457650001002474650002002484650002002504650002202524650002002546650002002566650001202586650001102598650002402609650004602633650000902679650002202688650002302710650003202733650000902765651001502774653002302789773011802812852000902930856010902939856011103048930003303159945002503192946001303217961001303230655001203243IND4394922420221119082209.0070910e200704  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439492242DNAL7 a174453782pmid7 a10.1603/0046-225X(2007)36[425:IOWTPO]2.0.CO;22doi7 a10113/55522hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF8211 aKnight, A.L.10aInfluence of Within-Orchard Trap Placement on Catch of Codling Moth (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae) in Sex Pheromone-Treated Orchards  ap. 425-432.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe influence of trap placement on catches of codling moth, Cydia pomonella L., was examined in a series of studies conducted in orchards treated with Isomate-C Plus sex pheromone dispensers. Mark-recapture tests with sterilized moths released along the interface of pairs of treated and untreated apple and pear plots found that significantly more male but not female moths were recaptured on interception traps placed in the treated plots. In a second test, significantly higher numbers of wild male and female moths were caught on interception traps placed in treated versus untreated plots within a heavily infested orchard. The highest numbers of male moths were caught on traps placed along the interior edge of the treated plots. Trap position had no influence on the captures of female moths. In a third test, north-south transects of sex pheromone-baited traps were placed through adjacent treated and untreated plots that received a uniform release of sterilized moths. Traps on the upwind edge of the treated plots caught similar numbers of moths as traps upwind from the treated plots. Moth catch was significantly reduced at all other locations inside versus outside of the treated plots, including traps placed on the downwind edge of the treated plot. In a fourth test, five apple orchards were monitored with groups of sex pheromone-baited traps placed either on the border or at three distances inside the orchards. The highest moth counts were in traps placed at the border, and the lowest moth counts were in traps placed 30 and 50 m from the border. In a fifth test, the proportion of traps failing to catch any moths despite the occurrence of local fruit injury was significantly higher in traps placed 50 versus 25 m from the border. The implications provided by these data for designing an effective monitoring program for codling moth in sex pheromone-treated orchards are discussed. 3aorchards 3aPyrus communis 3amark-recapture studies 3aapples 3atrapping 3asex pheromones 3aspatial distribution 3aedge effects 3apears 3apheromone traps 3aMalus domestica 3amating disruption 3apest monitoring 3aCydia pomonella 2aAnimals 2aFemale 2aFruitxparasitology 2aInsect Controlxinstrumentationxmethods. 2aMale 2aMothsxphysiology 2aPopulation Density 2aSex Attractantsxphysiology 2aWind 0aWashington 0ainterception traps0 tEnvironmental entomology.g2007 Apr., v.  36, no.  2 p.425-432dEntomological Society of Americax0046-225X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1603/0046-225X(2007)36%5B425:IOWTPO%5D2.0.CO;23Available from publisher's Web site40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/55523Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20071023b20071102c00000000  aINDdNZMe2007/10/22  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle01982naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100001700138245007000155300001800225520088000243592002801123650002601151650002901177650001801206650001501224650001701239650001601256700001301272700001801285700002101303700001601324700001801340700001301358700001101371773014501382856007201527852000901599655001201608IND60661961220221120033224.0190904e20091001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066196122DNAL7 a10.1039/b912589m2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMorawska, L.10aJEM Spotlight: Environmental monitoring of airborne nanoparticles  ap. 1758-1773.  aThe aim of this work was to review the existing instrumental methods to monitor airborne nanoparticles in different types of indoor and outdoor environments in order to detect their presence and to characterise their properties. Firstly the terminology and definitions used in this field are discussed, which is followed by a review of the methods to measure particle physical characteristics including number, concentration, size distribution and surface area. An extensive discussion is provided on the direct methods for particle elemental composition measurements, as well as on indirect methods providing information on particle volatility and solubility, and thus in turn on volatile and semivolatile compounds of which the particle is composed. A brief summary of broader considerations related to nanoparticle monitoring in different environments concludes the paper.  aPublisher supplied data 3aelemental composition 3aenvironmental monitoring 3ananoparticles 3asolubility 3asurface area 3aterminology1 aWang, H.1 aRistovski, Z.1 aJayaratne, E.

The study was carried out between 439 and 2145 m in Kumaun Himalayan region. A monolith of 25x25x15 cm¬≥ was used to extract the soil sample from the study sites. The soil samples were divided into 03 depth classes 0-5cm, 5‚Äì10 cm and 10‚Äì15 cm. ANOVA showed that number of viable seeds varied significantly across sites and depths (p<0.05) but not with species. The soil seed bank density at 05 cm depths was 3.2¬±0.05 and 10.1¬±0.08 m‚Åª¬≤ in S. robusta, 4.5¬±0.08 and 12.4¬±1.07 m‚Åª¬≤ on P. roxburghii and 2.3¬±0.06 and 5.4¬±0.3 m‚Åª¬≤ on Q. leucotrichophora. In oak dominated forest the total tree forest emergent varied from 3.2¬±1.89 to 18.4¬±2.01 m‚Åª¬≤, shrubs forest emergent varied from 8.3¬±1.21 to 64.4¬±2.97 m‚Åª¬≤ and herb emergent varied from 20.3¬±0.6 to 164.3¬±0.62m‚Åª¬≤. A significant positive co-relation was found between tree and shrubs emergent (r=0.228, p<0.01) and shrubs and herbs forest emergents (r=0.573, p<0.01). Litter abundance increases in areas of high pine density, which may decrease seed banks. The highest emergent in Q. leucotrichophora dominant sites could be due to the high moisture present in oak forest soil and favorable climatic conditions as compare to S. robusta and P. roxburghii dominated forests. Rise in temperature and resultant enhanced evapo-transpiration which desiccates seeds more rapidly in soil.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPinus roxburghii 3aQuercus leucotrichophora 3aShorea robusta 3aburied seeds 3aecology 3aevapotranspiration 3aforest soils 3aforests 3atemperature 3atrees 3aHimalayan region 0aHimalaya 0aP. roxburghii 0aQ. leucotrichophora 0aS. robusta 0aSoil seed bank1 aTewari, Ashish1 aSingh, Nandan1 aShah, Shruti0 tIndian journal of ecology.g2021 Apr., v. 48, no. 2 p.381-386dIndian Ecological SocietywJournal:16635x0304-52507nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle02654naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002200149245010900171300001600280520141500296592002801711650002201739650001101761650001501772650001801787650001101805650001401816650001401830650001001844650001501854650000901869651001801878653001501896653001701911653002201928653001801950653001701968653000901985700002301994773011102017856008302128852000902211655001202220IND60544645120221118011735.0190417e201412  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054464512DNAL7 a10.1016/j.gecco.2014.08.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBlersch, David M.10aSignatures of self-assembly in size distributions of wood members in dam structures of Castor canadensis  ap. 204-213.  aBeavers (Castor canadensis) construct dams on rivers throughout most of their historical range in North America, and their impact on water patterns in the landscape is considerable. Dam formation by beavers involves two processes: (1) intentional construction through the selection and placement of wood and sediment, which facilitates (2) the passive capture and accretion of suspended wood and sediment. The second process is a self-assembly mechanism that the beavers leverage by utilizing energy subsidies of watershed transport processes. The relative proportion of beaver activity to self-assembly processes in dam construction, however, is unknown. Here we show that lotic self-assembly processes account for a substantial portion of the work expended in beaver dam construction. We found through comprehensive measurement of the stick dimensions that the distributions for diameter, length, and volume are log-normal. By noting evidence of teeth markings, we determined that size distributions skewed significantly larger for wood handled by beavers compared to those that were not. Subsequent mass calculations suggest that beavers perform 50%‚Äì70% of the work of wood member placement for dam assembly, with riparian self-assembly processes contributing the remainder. Additionally, our results establish a benchmark for assessing the proportion of self-assembly work in similar riparian structures.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCastor canadensis 3aenergy 3alandscapes 3alotic systems 3arivers 3asediments 3asubsidies 3ateeth 3awatersheds 3awood 3aNorth America 0aBeaver dam 0aConstruction 0aCastor canadensis 0aSelf-assembly 0aDistribution 0aWood1 aKangas, Patrick C.0 tGlobal ecology and conservation.g2014 Dec., v. 2 p.204-213dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23212x2351-98947nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gecco.2014.08.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02118naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245016100159300002000320520104500340592002801385650002501413650001901438650002301457650001901480700001601499700001901515700001901534700001601553700001601569773012401585856007401709852000901783655001201792IND60641619820221120223728.0190505e20170403xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064161982DNAL7 a10.1039/c7ra02702h2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGadwal, Ikhlas10aAddressing the mid-point of polymer chains for multiple functionalization purposes through sequential thiol‚Äìepoxy ‚Äòclick‚Äô and esterification reactions  ap. 19439-19447.  aA synthetic strategy is devised for the preparation of mid-chain multifunctional polymers. In this strategy, small molecules carrying one or two epoxide units along with two polymerization-initiating sites were prepared in two to three synthetic steps. Atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) of methylmethacrylate (MMA) monomer using the newly designed initiators gave rise to epoxide-mid-reactive polymers. A careful chain cleavage study confirmed the midpoint location of the reactive site(s) on the polymer chain. Dual-modification of these reactive epoxide unit(s) through sequential thiol‚Äìepoxy and esterification reactions then afforded the midpoint multiply functionalized polymeric structures. Due to compatibility of the ATRP process with the reactive epoxide unit(s) and the cascade nature of the functionalization processes, the present strategy is free from the protective-group requirement of organic synthesis. Moreover, it allows for varying the number and nature of functionalities at the midpoint of a polymer chain.  aPublisher supplied data 3acleavage (chemistry) 3aesterification 3amethylmethacrylate 3apolymerization1 aEom, Taejun1 aHwang, JiHyeon1 aChoe, Youngson1 aBang, Joona1 aKhan, Anzar0 tRSC advances.g2017 Apr. 03, v. 7, no. 32 p.19439-19447dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c7ra02702h3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04234naa a2200697 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002300153245012300176300001600299520215700315592002802472650001802500650001702518650001502535650001602550650002802566650001802594650002802612650000902640650001602649650001602665650002602681650001502707650003702722650002602759650001202785650001002797650002202807650001402829650001402843650001202857650004302869650000902912650000902921650001402930650002902944650002002973650001002993650001503003651001803018653002803036653002303064653001503087653002903102653003603131700002103167700002003188700002403208700002203232700002403254700001903278700002403297773010703321856008703428852000903515655001203524IND60562462220221120132914.0170719e20160901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056246222DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2016.04.0872doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHaack, Sheridan K.10aContamination with bacterial zoonotic pathogen genes in U.S. streams influenced by varying types of animal agriculture  ap. 340-350.  aAnimal waste, stream water, and streambed sediment from 19 small (<32km2) watersheds in 12U.S. states having either no major animal agriculture (control, n=4), or predominantly beef (n=4), dairy (n=3), swine (n=5), or poultry (n=3) were tested for: 1) cholesterol, coprostanol, estrone, and fecal indicator bacteria (FIB) concentrations, and 2) shiga-toxin producing and enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli, Salmonella, Campylobacter, and pathogenic and vancomycin-resistant enterococci by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) on enrichments, and/or direct quantitative PCR. Pathogen genes were most frequently detected in dairy wastes, followed by beef, swine and poultry wastes in that order; there was only one detection of an animal-source-specific pathogen gene (stx1) in any water or sediment sample in any control watershed. Post-rainfall pathogen gene numbers in stream water were significantly correlated with FIB, cholesterol and coprostanol concentrations, and were most highly correlated in dairy watershed samples collected from 3 different states. Although collected across multiple states and ecoregions, animal-waste gene profiles were distinctive via discriminant analysis. Stream water gene profiles could also be discriminated by the watershed animal type. Although pathogen genes were not abundant in stream water or streambed samples, PCR on enrichments indicated that many genes were from viable organisms, including several (shiga-toxin producing or enterotoxigenic E. coli, Salmonella, vancomycin-resistant enterococci) that could potentially affect either human or animal health. Pathogen gene numbers and types in stream water samples were influenced most by animal type, by local factors such as whether animals had stream access, and by the amount of local rainfall, and not by studied watershed soil or physical characteristics. Our results indicated that stream water in small agricultural U.S. watersheds was susceptible to pathogen gene inputs under typical agricultural practices and environmental conditions. Pathogen gene profiles may offer the potential to address both source of, and risks associated with, fecal pollution.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCampylobacter 3aEnterococcus 3aSalmonella 3aShiga toxin 3aanimal and human health 3aanimal wastes 3abacterial contamination 3abeef 3acholesterol 3acoprostanol 3adiscriminant analysis 3aecoregions 3aenterotoxigenic Escherichia coli 3aenvironmental factors 3aestrone 3agenes 3aindicator species 3apathogens 3apollution 3apoultry 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3arain 3arisk 3asediments 3asoil physical properties 3astream channels 3aswine 3awatersheds 3aUnited States 0aZoonotic pathogen genes 0aAnimal agriculture 0aWatersheds 0aFecal indicator bacteria 0aPolymerase chain reaction (PCR)1 aDuris, Joseph W.1 aKolpin, Dana W.1 aFocazio, Michael J.1 aMeyer, Michael T.1 aJohnson, Heather E.1 aOster, Ryan J.1 aForeman, William T.0 tScience of the total environment.g2016 Sept. 01, v. 563-564 p.340-350dElsevier B.V.x0048-96977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2016.04.0873Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02657naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100003400140245016200174300001800336500002000354520091600374592002801290596007301318596006901391596008801460596006801548650002001616650001501636650001001651650001001661650001701671650001301688650000901701650001501710650001401725650001601739700006701755700003201822700003201854700003801886700003801924773015301962856007502115852000902190655001202199IND60755354820220219000000.0211030e202110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075535482DNAL7 a10.1111/ijfs.153122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSilva, Daisy Jacqueline Sousa10aCorrelation between the rheological and technological properties of biscuits with different levels of replacement of wheat flour by rice and azuki bean flour  ap. 5190-5200.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aA mixture design was used to evaluate the effect of replacing (0 to 100%) wheat flour (WF) with wholegrain azuki bean (WABF) and rice (RF) flours on the biscuits quality. High proportions of WABF increased diameter and decreased thickness, whereas WF affected inversely and RF intermediate. The WF biscuit specific volume was 17% greater than that of the dough, and the WABF and RF biscuits were 5 and 13% smaller, respectively. The WABF biscuit hardness was 26.25¬†N, close to WF (28.14¬†N), and higher than RF (7.6¬†N). The WABF increased the colour difference (ŒîE) values for biscuits by up to 22.19 and the RF by 1.87. Peak viscosity, breakdown and setback of mixture flours showed positive correlations with the dough hardness and L*, a*, b* and Aw of biscuits and negatively with the radial expansion index and ŒîE. The highest global desirability was for biscuits without WF, regardless of crust colour.  aPublisher supplied data  a11.15.02.002.03.08.003cEmpresa Brasileira de Pesquisa Agropecu√°ria  a20.18.01.022.00.00cEmpresa Brasileira de Pesquisa Agropecu√°ria  a313750 / 2019‚Äê0cConselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cient√≠ficos e Tecnol√≥gico  cCoordena√ß√£o de Aperfei√ßoamento de Pessoal de N√≠vel Superior 3aVigna angularis 3abean flour 3acolor 3adough 3afood science 3ahardness 3arice 3atechnology 3aviscosity 3awheat flour1 aHashimoto, Jorge Minoru1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6474-78141 aNabeshima, Elizabeth Harumi1 aSalgado,

A.10aSensors as tools for quantitation, nanotoxicity and nanomonitoring assessment of engineered nanomaterials  ap. 1782-1800.  aThe discovery of fullerenes in 1985 has ushered in an explosive growth in the applications of engineered nanomaterials and consumer products. Nanotechnology and engineered nanomaterials (ENMs) are being incorporated into a range of commercial products such as consumer electronics, cosmetics, imaging and sensors. Nanomaterials offer new possibilities for the development of novel sensing and monitoring technologies. Nanosensors can be classified under two main categories: (i) Nanotechnology-enabled sensors or sensors that are themselves nanoscale or have nanoscale materials or components, and (ii) Nanoproperty-quantifiable sensors or sensors that are used to measure nanoscale properties. The first category can eventually result in lower material cost, reduced weight and energy consumption. The second category can enhance our understanding of the potential toxic effects of emerging pollutants from nanomaterials including fullerenes, dendrimers, and carbon nanotubes. Despite the enormous literatures and reviews on Category I sensors, there are few sensors to measure nanoscale properties or sensors belonging to Category II. This class of nanosensors is an area of critical interest to nanotoxicology, detection and risk assessment, as well as for monitoring of environmental and/or biological exposure. This article discusses emerging fields of nanotoxicology and nanomonitoring including the challenges of characterizing engineered nanomaterials and the potentials of combining existing analytical techniques with conventional cytotoxicity methods. Two case studies are provided for development of Category II nanosensors for fullerene nanoparticles and quantum dots. One highlights the uniqueness of a portable, dissolved oxygen electrochemical sensor arrays capable of detecting the ENMs as well as provide rapid nanotoxicological information. This review has shown that addressing the complex and critical issues surrounding the environmental transformation and toxicity of ENMs must be accompanied by the creation of new approaches or further developments of existing instrumentation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanalytical methods 3acarbon nanotubes 3acase studies 3acytotoxicity 3adendrimers 3adissolved oxygen 3aenergy 3afullerene 3ainstrumentation 3amonitoring 3aoxygen 3apollutants 3aquantum dots 3arisk assessment 3asensors (equipment)1 aZhou, A.

In this study, an alfalfa (Medica sativa L.) HO-1 gene MsHO1 was isolated and sequenced. It contains four exons and three introns within genomic DNA sequence and encodes a polypeptide with 283 amino acids. MsHO1 had a conserved HO signature sequence and showed high similarity to other HOs in plants, especially HO-1 isoform. The MsHO1:GFP fusion protein was localized in the chloroplast. Further biochemical activity analysis of mature MsHO1, which was expressed in Escherichia coli, showed that the Vmax was 48.78nmol biliverdin-IXŒ± (BV) h‚Åª¬πnmol‚Åª¬π protein with an apparent Km value for hemin of 2.33ŒºM, and the optimum Tm and pH were 37¬∞C and 7.2, respectively. Results of semi-quantitative RT-PCR and western blot showed that the expressions of MsHO1 were higher in alfalfa stems and leaves than those in germinating seeds and roots. Importantly, MsHO1 gene expression and protein level were induced significantly by some pro-oxidant compounds, including hemin and nitric oxide (NO) donor sodium nitroprusside (SNP). In conclusion, MsHO1 may play an important role in oxidative responses.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aEscherichia coli 3aMedicago sativa 3aWestern blotting 3aalfalfa 3achloroplasts 3aexons 3agene expression 3aheme oxygenase (biliverdin-producing) 3aintrons 3anitric oxide 3anitroprusside 3apH 3aplant physiology 3apolypeptides 3aprotein content1 aXu, Sheng1 aXie, Yan-Jie1 aHan, Bin1 aNie, Li1 aShen, Wen-Biao1 aWang, Ren0 tPlant physiology and biochemistry.g2011 July, v. 49, no. 7 p.792-799dElsevier Masson SASx0981-94287nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.plaphy.2011.01.0183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02935naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001900142245014400161300001600305520163300321592002801954650002201982650001702004650002402021650001702045650001102062650002102073650001402094650001002108650002202118650002502140650001402165651001102179651001102190700002002201700002002221700002002241700002002261773014602281856007702427852000902504655001202513IND60594314320221120045914.0180620e201711  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059431432DNAL7 a10.5735/086.054.05012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMori, Emiliano10aStrangers Coming from the Sahara: An Update of the Worldwide Distribution, Potential Impacts and Conservation Opportunities of Alien Aoudad  ap. 373-386.  aBiological invasions are considered one of the main causes of the current global biodiversity crisis. Many ungulate species have been introduced worldwide, mainly as game animals or e.g. as an attraction in suburban parks. We compiled the available information on distribution, abundance and ecology of the aoudad Ammotragus lervia outside its native range. We showed that the aoudad has established a number of populations in many countries outside its natural range. Alien nuclei have been recorded in at least 10 countries in Europe, Africa and America but it may be an underestimation. Establishment success differs geographically. North American and Spanish populations are large and still expanding, whereas others are small. This difference might be related to a large propagule pressure, but we suggest it might be due to multiple introduction events or better niche suitability. Information on potential impacts of alien populations on natural systems, human activities and disease spread is still scarce. Despite that, the aoudad is already known to be a carrier of parasites, and therefore it has been suggested that further range expansion of the aoudad may affect populations of native ungulates. Alien populations of the aoudad are controlled mainly by hunting, but as it targets mainly weak animals this method may actually improve reproductive success and increase invasive potential. Since prevention, early detection and eradication of small/isolated populations of invasive species are highly recommended, early and selective culling should be carried out to reduce population increase of this alien ungulate.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAmmotragus lervia 3abiodiversity 3aecological invasion 3agame animals 3ahumans 3ainvasive species 3aparasites 3aparks 3apopulation growth 3areproductive success 3aungulates 3aAfrica 3aEurope1 aMazza, Giuseppe1 aSaggiomo, Laura1 aSommese, Andrea1 aEsattore, Bruno0 tAnnales zoologici Fennici.g2017 Nov., v. 54, no. 5‚Äì6 p.373-386dFinnish Zoological and Botanical PublishingwJournal:1916x0003-455X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.5735/086.054.05013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02124naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002200145245015000167300001800317520104800335592002801383650001301411650002801424650001401452650002001466650001101486650002001497650000901517651001101526700001901537700003301556700002301589773010501612856004801717852000901765655001201774IND4483419420221122121907.0120416e201204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448341942DNAL7 a10.1007/s12665-011-1450-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKong A Siou, Line10aOptimization of the generalization capability for rainfall√¢¬Ä¬ìrunoff modeling by neural networks: the case of the Lez aquifer (southern France)  ap. 2365-2375.  aNeural networks are increasingly used in the field of hydrology due to their properties of parsimony and universal approximation with regard to nonlinear systems. Nevertheless, as a result of the existence of noise and approximations in hydrological data, which are very significant in some cases, such systems are particularly sensitive to increased model complexity. This dilemma is known in machine learning as bias√¢¬Ä¬ìvariance and can be avoided by suitable regularization methods. Following a presentation of the bias√¢¬Ä¬ìvariance dilemma along with regularization methods such as cross-validation, early stopping and weight decay, an application is provided for simulating and forecasting karst aquifer outflows at the Lez site. The efficiency of this regularization process is thus demonstrated on a nonlinear, partially unknown basin. As a last step, results are presented over the most intense rainfall event found in the database, which allows assessing the capability of neural networks to generalize with rare or extreme events.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaquifers 3aartificial intelligence 3adatabases 3ahydrologic data 3akarsts 3aneural networks 3arain 3aFrance1 aJohannet, Anne1 aVal√É¬©rie, Borrell Estupina1 aPistre, S√É¬©verin0 tEnvironmental earth sciences.g2012 Apr., v. 65, no. 8 p.2365-2375dSpringer-Verlagx1866-62807nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12665-011-1450-9  aDNAL 7aarticle03193naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245023800167500002200405520158700427592002802014650001702042650002202059650005602081650001002137650001102147650001102158650002602169650001202195650002202207653001502229653003202244653004502276653006402321653001702385653002402402700002502426700001702451700002002468700002002488700002402508700002702532773007102559856008402630852000902714655001202723IND60586162520221116211533.0171119s2017    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058616252DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chroma.2017.11.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBaglai, Anna10aComprehensive lipidomic analysis of human plasma using multidimensional liquid- and gas-phase separations: Two-dimensional liquid chromatography‚Äìmass spectrometry vs. liquid chromatography‚Äìtrapped-ion-mobility‚Äìmass spectrometry  aPre-press version  aRecent advancements in separation science have resulted in the commercialization of multidimensional separation systems that provide higher peak capacities and, hence, enable a more-detailed characterization of complex mixtures. In particular, two powerful analytical tools are increasingly used by analytical scientists, namely online comprehensive two-dimensional liquid chromatography (LC√óLC, having a second-dimension separation in the liquid phase) and liquid chromatography-ion mobility-spectrometry (LC-IMS, second dimension separation in the gas phase).The goal of the current study was a general assessment of the liquid-chromatography‚Äìtrapped-ion-mobility‚Äìmass spectrometry (LC-TIMS‚ÄìMS) and comprehensive two-dimensional liquid chromatography‚Äìmass spectrometry (LC√óLC‚ÄìMS) platforms for untargeted lipid mapping in human plasma.For the first time trapped-ion-mobility spectrometry (TIMS) was employed for the separation of the major lipid classes and ion-mobility-derived collision-cross-section values were determined for a number of lipid standards. The general effects of a number of influencing parameters have been inspected and possible directions for improvements are discussed.We aimed to provide a general indication and practical guidelines for the analyst to choose an efficient multidimensional separation platform according to the particular requirements of the application. Analysis time, orthogonality, peak capacity, and an indicative measure for the resolving power are discussed as main characteristics for multidimensional separation systems.  aPublisher supplied data 3ablood plasma 3acommercialization 3acomprehensive two-dimensional liquid chromatography 3agases 3ahumans 3alipids 3aliquid chromatography 3aliquids 3amass spectrometry 0aLipidomics 0aMultidimensional separation 0aTrapped-ion-mobility‚Äìmass spectrometry 0aOn-line comprehensive two-dimensional liquid chromatography 0aHuman plasma 0aUntargeted analysis1 aGargano, Andrea F.G.1 aJordens, Jan1 aMengerink, Ynze1 aHoning, Maarten1 avan der Wal, Sjoerd1 aSchoenmakers, Peter J.0 tJournal of chromatography.g2017, dElsevier B.V.x0021-96737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chroma.2017.11.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03109naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001800146245011500164300001600279520176700295592002802062650001402090650002602104650002202130650001302152650003702165650001402202650002302216650003402239650001102273650001702284700005402301700001702355700001602372700001602388700001702404700005602421773013302477856008002610852000902690655001202699IND60605544720221119040512.0180721e20180118xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060554472DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcb.7b051402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Chaoqiang10aGrowth Behavior of Pristine and Potassium Doped Coronene Thin Films on Substrates with Tuned Coupling Strength  ap. 601-611.  aThe growth of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) molecular coronene film on various substrates and the subsequent doping of potassium under ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) conditions have been systematically investigated by low-temperature scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy (STM/STS). The crystalline structures and molecular orientations of coronene thin films are both thickness-dependent and substrate-sensitive due to the competition between molecule‚Äìsubstrate interaction and intermolecular interaction. In mono- or bilayer films, coronene molecules are flat-lying on the surface with hexagonal lattice, whereas in multilayer films, the topmost molecules are in a standing-up but tilted configuration with rectangular lattice. In particular, a 2 √ó 1 superstructure with respect to that of bulk coronene is formed on thick KCl film. Furthermore, we have studied the potassium doped coronene monolayer and multilayer on Ag(100) and KCl/Ag(100) surface. For K-doped coronene monolayer, at certain doping ratio x = 3, the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of coronene film moves to the Fermi level, and a splitting of the LUMO state is observed. Increased potassium doping would result in a filled LUMO state below the Fermi level. By contrast, no well-ordered structures are obtained in the K-doped coronene multilayers which are vulnerable to rather moderate annealing processes owing to their relatively weak bonding with the supporting substrates, implying a big challenge of growth of PAH thick films in vacuum. The differences in the crystal structures of coronene thin films compared with that in bulk crystals might shed insight on the controversies in the experimental results on the electronic properties of alkali-metal-doped PAHs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aannealing 3achemical interactions 3acrystal structure 3acrystals 3apolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 3apotassium 3apotassium chloride 3ascanning tunneling microscopy 3asilver 3aspectroscopy1 aQue, Yande1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5267-49851 aZhuang, Yuan1 aLin, Zhijun1 aWu, Xuefeng1 aWang, Kedong1 aXiao, Xudong1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0551-11440 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2018 Jan. 18, v. 122, no. 2 p.601-611dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19284x1520-52077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcb.7b051403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03040naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245009200159500001400251520167300265592002801938650003101966650001501997650001202012650001902024650002502043650001802068650002102086650001702107650002402124650001802148650001102166650001402177650001402191650001502205650000902220650000902229650001902238650002602257700002102283700003302304700002702337773012202364856007502486852000902561655001202570IND60703446520221120054109.0200721e20200127xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070344652DNAL7 a10.3390/nu120203322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDeding, Ulrik 10aCarrot Intake and Risk of Colorectal Cancer: A Prospective Cohort Study of 57,053 Danes  aNAL-light  aCarrots are consumed worldwide. Several meta-analysis studies on carrot consumption have indicated that carrots play a central role as a protecting vegetable against development of different types of cancers. A cancer-preventive role of carrots is plausible because they are the main dietary source of the bioactive polyacetylenic oxylipins falcarinol (FaOH) and falcarindiol (FaDOH), which have shown anti-proliferative and anti-inflammatory activity in numerous in vitro studies. In addition, purified FaOH and FaDOH have, in recent studies in colorectal cancer (CRC)-primed rats, demonstrated an anti-neoplastic effect in a dose-dependent manner. The mechanisms of action for this effect appears to be due to inhibition of pro-inflammatory and transcription factor biomarkers for inflammation and cancer. However, studies of the CRC-preventive effect of carrots in a large cohort are still missing. We therefore examined the risk of being diagnosed with CRC as predicted by intake of carrots in a Danish population of 57,053 individuals with a long follow-up. Self-reported intake of raw carrots at a baseline of 2‚Äì4 carrots or more each week (>32 g/day) was associated with a 17% decrease in risk of CRC with a mean follow-up of >18 years, compared to individuals with no intake of raw carrots even after extensive model adjustments (HR 0.83 CI 95% 0.71; 0.98). An intake below 2‚Äì4 carrots each week (<32 g/day) was not significantly associated with reduced risk of CRC (HR 0.93 CI 95% 0.82; 1.06). The results of this prospective cohort study clearly support the results from studies in cancer-primed rats for CRC and hence a CRC-preventive effect of carrots.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanti-inflammatory activity 3abiomarkers 3acarrots 3acohort studies 3acolorectal neoplasms 3adose response 3ain vitro studies 3ainflammation 3amechanism of action 3ameta-analysis 3amodels 3anutrients 3aoxylipins 3apopulation 3arats 3arisk 3arisk reduction 3atranscription factors1 aBaatrup, Gunnar 1 aChristensen, Lars  Porskj√¶r1 aKobaek-Larsen, Morten 0 tNutrients.g2020 Jan. 27, v. 12, no. 2dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2271x2072-66437nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu120203323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03126naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002300150245021000173500002200383520152500405592002801930650001301958650001201971650001701983650001502000650001102015650001802026650001102044650004302055650002702098650001302125650000902138650001802147650000702165650001802172650001302190650001702203653001802220653000902238653002502247653001102272653000902283700001802292700002002310700002002330700002502350700002002375700002502395773007102420856008402491852000902575655001202584IND60586162620221116211701.0171119s2017    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058616262DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chroma.2017.11.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aArmentano, Antonio10aRapid method for the quantification of 13 Sulphonamides in milk by conventional high-performance liquid chromatography with diode array ultraviolet detection using a column packed with core-shell particles  aPre-press version  aIn the present study, a column packed with core-shell particles was used for the separation and the quantification of 13 sulphonamides in milk by conventional high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with diode array ultraviolet detection (HPLC/UV-DAD). Preliminary experiments were carried out to investigate selectivity of different stationary phases. Best results were achieved using a C18 column packed with 2.6Œºm core-shell particles (diameter 4.6mm, length 75mm). A binary gradient elution based on acetate buffer solution at pH 4.50 and a mixture of methanol acetonitrile 50:50 (v/v) was employed at the flow rate of 1.2mLmin‚àí1 with an injection volume of 6ŒºL. These chromatographic conditions allowed the efficient separation of 13 sulphonamides in about 8minutes. To evaluate the suitability of the method for official control analysis, the most important validation parameters were investigated according to the European Decision 657/2002/EC as established for analysis of drug residues in food. Sulphonamides were recovered from milk samples by a simple and quick preparation procedure consisting of an extraction step with chloroform/acetone and a purification step with n-hexane. Mean recoveries from raw milk ranged between 55% and 86% at the Maximum Residual Limit of 100Œºgkg‚àí1, and RSDs% resulted lower than Thompson and Horwitz RSD% reference values for all sulphonamides. The LOQ value (2.7‚Äì15Œºgkg‚àí1) was low enough to satisfy legal limits suggested by European Regulation 37/2010/EC.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetates 3aacetone 3aacetonitrile 3achloroform 3adiodes 3adrug residues 3ahexane 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3amaximum residue limits 3amethanol 3amilk 3anormal values 3apH 3arapid methods 3araw milk 3asulfonamides 0aSulphonamides 0aHPLC 0aCore-shell particles 0aUV-DAD 0aMilk1 aSumma, Simona1 aLo Magro, Sonia1 aPalermo, Carmen1 aNardiello, Donatella1 aCentonze, Diego1 aMuscarella, Marilena0 tJournal of chromatography.g2017, dElsevier B.V.x0021-96737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chroma.2017.11.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01825naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100001800112245007900130300001600209520091600225592002801141650001201169650001201181650001701193650001001210650001001220650002001230650001101250650001101261653000901272653001501281653001001296700001801306700001701324773012501341852000901466655001201475IND60747708420221119132306.0210818e202104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074770842DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKour, Mandeep10aEffect of osmotic agents on the quality characteristics of osmo-dried plum  ap. 408-410.  aThe present investigation was carried in Division of Food Science and Technology, SKUAST Jammu during the year 2018‚Äì2019. The objective of this study was to develop osmo-dried plum by different osmotic agents and their shelf stability. Plums were dipped in different osmotic agents (40, 50, 60 and 70 ·µíBrix) of sugar and honey for the preparation of osmo-dried plum followed by packing in LDPE bags and storage in ambient conditions subjected to physico-chemical and microbial characteristics at an interval of one month for a period of three months. Storage studies indicated that there was significant decrease in ash and calcium content. The stored osmo-dried plum was found microbiologically safe. The storability study revealed that osmo-dried plum prepared from dipping in 70 ·µíBrix Honey Syrup have good-shelf life and can be kept for more than three months without affecting the quality attributes.  aPublisher supplied data 3acalcium 3aecology 3afood science 3ahoney 3aplums 3astorage quality 3asugars 3asyrups 0aPlum 0aOsmo-dried 0aSugar1 aGupta, Neeraj1 aSood, Monika0 tIndian journal of ecology.g2021 Apr., v. 48, no. 2 p.408-410dIndian Ecological SocietywJournal:16635x0304-52507nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle01500naa a2200289 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002000145245006200165300001800227520065500245592002800900650001000928650002000938650001700958650001300975650001600988700001701004700001801021773010201039856004801141852000901189655001201198IND4483972620221122121825.0120715e201112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448397262DNAL7 a10.1007/s11434-011-4764-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Yongtian,10aMagnetoresistance oscillations in La-based metallic glass  ap. 3984-3987.  aWe report that La60Fe30Al10 metallic glass has clear, reproducible, periodic variation in its differential resistance as a function of a perpendicular magnetic field below its superconducting transition temperature.

An experimental 3¬≥ design, three concentrations of maltodextrin (5, 7, and 10%), three concentrations of native agave fructans (0, 2, and 4%), and three feed temperatures (110, 115, and 120 ‚ÑÉ) were used. The results using the treatment in which only maltodextrin was used as a reference indicated that an increment in the inlet temperature decreases the moisture content, aw, and solubility. Likewise, an increase (more than 2%) in fructans concentration generates products with increased aw, moisture, hygroscopicity, wettability, and greater solubility. Additionally, no modification of storage stability was observed. Mango and pineapple powder color were affected mainly by the inlet temperature, causing an increase in luminosity (L*) and a decrease in parameter (a*). A scanning electron microscopy showed spherical powder particles with certain contractions; powder stability in treatments with native agave fructans was not modified in the treatment at 2%. Finally, the addition of 2% agave fructans as carrier material was able to reduce the maltodextrin concentration of the spray drying process.  aPublisher supplied data  aPEI-210874cConsejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnolog√≠adhttps://doi.org/https://doi.org/10.13039/501100003141 3acolor 3afructans 3ahygroscopicity 3amaltodextrins 3amangoes 3apineapple juice 3apineapples 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asolubility 3aspray drying 3astorage quality 3atemperature 3awater content 3awettability 0aAgave fructans 0amaltodextrin 0aspray drying 0ahygroscopicity1 aCalder√≥n-Santoyo, Montserrat1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8744-18151 aOrtiz-Basurto, Rosa I1 aBautista-Rosales, Pedro U1 aRagazzo-S√°nchez, Juan A1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2298-33060 tFood science and technology international.g, v. 24, no. 6 p.519-532dSAGE PublicationswJournal:jnl3949853x1082-01327nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/10820132187691683Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03393naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245011100172520191100283592002802194650002502222650001602247650001102263650002102274650001102295650001302306650001702319650002602336650002702362650001302389650002902402653001802431653002702449653004902476653001602525653001902541653001902560700006102579700005802640700006202698773009202760856008602852852000902938655001202947IND60741006120221121130308.0211219e20211001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074100612DNAL7 a10.1016/j.talanta.2021.1225822doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBened√©, Juan L.10aCarbon fibers as green and sustainable sorbent for the extraction of isoflavones from environmental waters  aIsoflavones are a group of phytoestrogens of important environmental concern due to their endocrine disrupting effects. This article presents a rapid, green, and sustainable method for determining four isoflavones (daidzein, genistein, formononetin, and biochanin A) in environmental waters complying with current trends in Analytical Chemistry. The method consists of in-syringe dispersive solid-phase extraction (DSPE) as the extraction approach, using carbon fibers as extraction material. The synthesis of carbon fibers is simple and sustainable, since it only requires a natural product such as raw cotton as precursor, which is thermally treated (600¬†¬∞C for 30¬†min) in an inert (Ar) atmosphere to convert it into carbon fibers. After extraction, the final eluate is analyzed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). The proposed methodology allows the determination of the four isoflavones in water samples at the ng L‚Åª¬π range, with limits of detection in the range from 17 to 25¬†ng¬†L‚Åª¬π, relative standard deviations (RSD) from 2.8 to 10.1%, and good batch-to-batch repeatability (RSD¬†<¬†13%). The method was finally applied to six environmental water samples from different sources and two swimming pool waters, and concentrations of all analytes up to 490¬†ng¬†L‚Åª¬π were found. The highest concentrations were found in those samples close to crop fields. Relative recovery values (80‚Äì121%) showed that the aqueous matrices considered in this work did not significantly affect the extraction process. This method overcomes the drawbacks of the previous works with the same purpose, such as consuming large volumes of organic solvents or prolonged extraction times. Moreover, this procedure would allow the extraction stage to be carried out in situ, since only the sorbent material (previously synthesized in the laboratory) and disposable syringes are required.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanalytical chemistry 3abiochanin A 3acarbon 3achemical species 3acotton 3adaidzein 3aformononetin 3aliquid chromatography 3asolid phase extraction 3asorbents 3atandem mass spectrometry 0aCarbon fibers 0aEnvironmental analysis 0aIn-syringe dispersive solid phase extraction 0aIsoflavones 0aPhytoestrogens 0aSurface waters1 aChisvert, Alberto1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1349-04781 aLucena, Rafael1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4625-24601 aC√°rdenas, Soledad1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4155-82840 tTalanta.g2021 Oct. 01, v. 233 p.122582-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11742x0039-91407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.talanta.2021.1225823Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03361naa a2200685 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245009800169300001600267520161600283592002801899650001401927650001801941650001301959650002401972650001701996650002302013650001502036650001302051650002102064650001202085650001402097650001402111650002102125653002802146653002202174653002602196653000702222653001002229653000802239653000802247653000802255653000602263653000902269653000802278653000702286653000602293653001002299653000802309653000702317653001002324653000802334653000802342653000902350653000902359653000802368653000802376653000902384700002302393700002002416700003402436773009902470856008502569852000902654655001202663IND60762384320221119115322.0220205e20220215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076238432DNAL7 a10.1016/j.wasman.2021.12.0432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGreses, Silvia10aMicroalgae production for nitrogen recovery of high-strength dry anaerobic digestion effluent  ap. 321-329.  aDry anaerobic digestion (D-AD) generates nitrogen-rich effluents that are normally neglected in the circular bioeconomy. The high turbidity and ammonium content hamper nitrogen recovery from these effluents via biological processes, such as microalgae culture. The goal of this study was to demonstrate microalgae growth viability in high-strength D-AD effluents in order to recover nitrogen (N) as microalgae biomass. According to the experimental factorial design conducted in batch reactors, ammonium was identified as the critical inhibitory compound for microalgae growth while turbidity did not exhibit a significantly negative effect. Instead, turbidity resulted advantageous since it promoted high nitrogen uptake rates and biomass production. The presence of organic turbidity resulted in a positive effect that boosted Chlorella growth in a stream with higher ammonium (350¬†mg NH‚ÇÑ‚Å∫-N L‚Åª¬π) and turbidity (175 NTU) than the inhibition thresholds reported in the literature, reaching 98.7% of N recovery as microalgae biomass. When microalgae culture was scaled up in a photobioreactor operated in continuous mode, microalgae biomass was effectively produced while recovering 100% of N at a hydraulic retention time of 10¬†days. By imposing long exposure times and high turbidity, Chlorella adaptation to high-strength D-AD effluent resulted in high N uptake and biomass production. This study demonstrated not only the most influencing factor and the optimal NH‚ÇÑ‚Å∫-N and turbidity combination, but also the viability of using D-AD effluents as culture media for microalgae biomass production.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChlorella 3aalgae culture 3aammonium 3aanaerobic digestion 3abioeconomics 3abiomass production 3amicroalgae 3anitrogen 3aphotobioreactors 3astreams 3aturbidity 3aviability 3awaste management 0aDry anaerobic digestion 0aNutrient recovery 0aMicroalgae adaptation 0aAD 0aANOVA 0aBBM 0aChl 0aCOD 0aC 0aD-AD 0aHRT 0aLD 0aN 0aNrate 0aNTU 0aOD 0aOFMSW 0aOLR 0aPBR 0aSCOD 0aTCOD 0aTSS 0aVSS 0aW-AD1 aTom√°s-Pej√≥, Elia1 aMarkou, Giorgos1 aGonzalez-Fernandez, Cristina,0 tWaste management.g2022 Feb. 15, v. 139 p.321-329dElsevier LtdwJournal:6325x0956-053X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2021.12.0433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle
